   Sotheby's auction house announced Wednesday that
it will buy the contents of a Manhattan gallery for $142.8 million
in what may be the biggest art deal ever, both because of the
number of paintings and their value.
   Sotheby's will acquire one of the great inventories of
20th-century art when it buys the 2,300 works from the Pierre
Matisse Gallery in a joint venture with William Acquavella, a New
York art dealer.
   Until now, Sotheby's has represented art sellers, putting up for
auction works owned by others and taking a commission from the sale.
   With the acquisition of the Matisse Gallery works, Sotheby's
will be in the business of owning the art it sells, rather than
operating in the auction house's traditional manner of representing
sellers.
   Acquavella will be managing partner of the joint venture company
being set up with Sotheby's, to be called Acquavella Modern Art.
   ``As far as I know, it is the biggest art deal both in the
number of paintings and the art value that has been done in the art
world,'' Acquavella told The New York Times.
   The gallery's inventory of 2,300 works by artists including Joan
Miro, Alberto Giacometti and Marc Chagall is being sold by the
estate of Pierre Matisse, an art dealer and son of painter Henri
Matisse. Pierre Matisse died Aug. 9.
   Some of the artworks will be sold at auction. But Acquavella
said he also planned to have exhibitions around the world and work
with dealers in different countries to sell the works privately.

   Hundreds of Contra rebels outside
this mountain hamlet refused to begin handing over their weapons
Wednesday, the day the anti-Sandinista guerrillas were to start
demobilizing.
   Two hours after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was sworn in as
president, about 500 rebels gathered on a hillside in one of five
security zones where the demobilization is to take place.
   Israel Galeano, a top rebel chief, and 12 other Contra
commanders were on hand. Galeano delivered an anti-Sandinista
diatribe and vowed he would be the last to lay down his weapon.
Then he invited his men to surrender their arms.
   The guerrillas broke out in laughter en masse. ``Nobody gives up
his gun!'' shouted one, and all cheered.
   Galeano, known as Commander Franklin, addressed the troops after
meeting briefly with Spanish Maj. Jose Luis Gracia, representative
of the United Nations Central American peacekeeping force.
   Gracia said the U.N. contingent was ready to begin accepting the
rebels' weapons. The peacekeepers, however, have no mandate to
forcibly disarm the Contras.
   The incident occurred in Zone 1, a security enclave 85 miles
north of Managua that covers 174 square miles.
   While it is not the largest of the five zones geographically, it
is thought to harbor the most fighters. About 3,000 Contras are
estimated to have arrived the past week.
   About 9,000 Contras are to gather in the five zones in coming
days.
   The rebels, who roam the zone at will, are unsupervised and have
Soviet-made assault rifles, grenade launchers and other weaponry.
   They have small stores of food and are supposed to receive
demobilization aid from the Organization of American States.
   The assembled rebels were also addressed Wednesday by Roberto
Ferrey, who traveled to the zone to represent Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``Now it is the turn of the resistance to take action
contributing to peace and reconciliation,'' he said. ``You have to
make an effort to understand that the Sandinistas are no longer in
power.''
   He appealed for demobilization before June 10, the date agreed
to in a pact signed last week by Oscar Sobalvarro, the No. 2 man in
the Contra command.
   Several Contras, though, rose to challenge Ferrey.
   ``Jackson,'' a regional commander, told assembly: ``I'd rather
take to the mountains, live in the jungle with my comrades until
our conditions are met. And those conditions have not yet been
met.''
   Of the dozens interviewed at the assembly, not a single Contra
said he would hand over his weapon as long as the Sandinistas
controlled the army and security forces.
   Mrs. Chamorro named Gen. Humberto Ortega, former President
Daniel Ortega's brother, to head the army as a conciliatory
measure. She is commander in chief.

   Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher, who drew
widespread attention when he banned a pro-choice political
candidate from receiving Communion last year, underwent surgery to
remove a brain tumor Wednesday.
   Maher, 74, was in serious condition after the 2{-hour operation
at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla. Doctors said they were optimistic he
would recover from the surgery but expressed concern about a
recurrence of the life-threatening tumor.
   Dr. Thomas Waltz, who led the operating team, said doctors
removed 75 percent to 80 percent of the tumor, which was about 3
inches in diameter and located in the back right portion of the
brain.
   ``It's a tumor that you really can't classify as either
malignant or benign,'' Waltz said. ``It doesn't spread to other
parts of the body, but it can recur.''
   He said the tumor's possible recurrence can be suppressed by
radiation therapy.
   Maher checked into the clinic Monday after his physician became
concerned over his condition, the Diocese of San Diego said in a
statement. Tests then revealed the brain lesion and the surgery was
scheduled, said Sue Pondrom, a spokeswoman for Scripps Clinic.
   In the past several weeks, the diocese said, Maher ``has grown
increasingly aware of a lack of physical strength and at times has
demonstrated a loss of equilibrium.''
   At midday, Pondrom confirmed that the operation had been
completed but said no information on the bishop's condition would
be released until later in the day.
   Scores of Catholics started a prayer vigil for the bishop on
Tuesday.
   Under diocesan law, Maher must retire as head of the
460,000-member diocese by his 75th birthday, July 1.
   He has held the position since 1969. His tenure has been marked
by great growth in the diocese as well as by controversy. Most
recently, he last fall banned Lucy Killea, then an Assemblywoman
running for state Senate, from receiving Communion because of her
outspoken views in favor of abortion rights.
   The sanction and its implications on the abortion issue and the
separation of church and state became focal points for voters, who
elected Killea, a Democrat, over Republican Carol Bentley.
   Bentley, a pro-life candidate, blamed Maher's intervention and
the subsequent national publicity Killea received for her loss in
the Republican-dominated district.

   A woman in a white dress stabbed
opposition leader Oskar Lafontaine in the neck Wednesday while
offering him flowers at a campaign rally. Officials said he was in
serious condition.
   Lafontaine, the left-of-center governor of Saarland state and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's leading challenger in the upcoming
December elections, was stabbed with a knife as he was about to
sign his autograph for his attacker, police said.
   Hospital authorities said the 46-year-old leader of the Social
Democratic Party was in serious condition due to blood loss but
that his life was no longer in danger. A neck artery was severed in
the attack, ministry officials said.
   Police late Wednesday identified the assailant as Adelheid
Streidel, 42, from Bad Neuenahr southwest of Bonn. The television
network ZDF quoted relatives as saying the woman had a history of
mental illness.
   Kohl, in Paris for a West German-French summit, said the attack
has ``deeply shaken me. At this hour one can only hope that Oskar
Lafontaine survives.'' The statement was released by the
chancellor's Bonn office.
   Social Democrat spokesman Eduard Heussen said the attacker
approached Lafontaine on the dais at a rally in a Cologne suburb
with a bouquet of flowers and an album containing poetry.
   The woman stabbed Lafontaine while he was looking at the album,
Heussen said.
   Lafontaine was rushed by helicopter to the University Clinic in
the Cologne suburb of Lindenthal, police said.
   In a late-evening news broadcast, the ARD television network
showed the politician lying on the floor as blood poured from his
neck. Several people crowded around him trying to administer first
aid.
   ZDF said Lafontaine could not be moved for up to 45 minutes
because his condition was so poor and loss of blood so great.
   The stabbing suspect, wearing a white dress, sat impassively as
a throng of policemen screamed at her, ``Who are you? Who are you?
Tell us your name! Say it!''
   The woman stared at police and the camera and said nothing. The
television showed her being hustled out of the hall by a group of
policemen.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said the woman was arrested.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office, said there was no evidence the woman has a ``terrorist
background.''
   Authorities said there was no known motive for the 9 p.m. attack.
   ``Oskar Lafontaine collapsed immediately, covered with blood.
The attacker was captured,'' ZDF reported.
   ZDF said 800 to 900 people were at the campaign rally in
suburban Muelheim.
   ``Everyone in the hall was horrified. There was mass
confusion,'' said ZDF.
   Lafontaine is one of West Germany's most colorful, acid-tongued
and popular politicians, an unrelenting critic of Kohl and his
policies of speedy German unification.
   Lafontaine, divorced, is also known as having an active social
life, and reports on who he's been seen with often prove to be
leading news items for the tabloid press in West Germany.
   His most recent liaison is with a Frankfurt hotelier's daughter
whose dyed blond punk-style haircut delighted news photographers.
   On Monday, Lafontaine harshly criticized Kohl for the projected
cost of German reunification, set for July 2.
   The outspoken politician, whose party trounced Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union in state elections in January, has been considered
a tough opponent in the chancellor's bid for a third four-year term.
   Lafontaine, a party activist at age 21, became mayor of
Saarbruecken at 32. In 1987, he became deputy chairman of the
Social Democrats despite opposition from the party's conservative
wing, headed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   He strongly opposed plans under Schmidt's government in the late
1970s to station U.S. medium-range nuclear weapons in West Germany.
   Lafontaine is governor of tiny Saarland state, one of the
poorest regions in West Germany. It borders France and Luxembourg.

   Some Wellesley College students have
inadvertently hit a feminist sore spot by protesting Barbara Bush's
selection as commencement speaker.
   The students gained headlines by circulating a petition saying
``to honor Barbara Bush as a commencement speaker is to honor a
woman who has gained recognition through the achievements of her
husband, which contradicts what we have been taught over our years
at Wellesley.''
   The petition was signed by 150 of the 2,200 students at the
elite women's school.
   But defense of the first lady percolated slowly and then poured
forth, even from some of the most liberal corners of the Boston
area.
   ``What seems to have happened here is that the feminist
standards of the '90s are being applied to a woman who matured in
another era,'' wrote Boston Globe columnist David Nyhan, who is no
Bush fan. ``Barbara Bush is a woman of exemplary values, vast charm
and unrivaled popularity, to list those traits in descending
order.''
   The flap has stirred the tranquil college campus, nestled in a
corner of this posh Boston suburb, where the cost of tuition, room
and board runs to about $18,000 a year.
   Students involved with the petition have become a little
publicity shy in the wake of the criticism, according to the senior
class dean.
   In another Globe article, Suzanne Gordon, a freelance writer and
feminist who has a book due out in January called ``Prisoner of
Men's Dreams,'' laid out her argument against the students.
   Gordon wrote that the petition ``made me mad enough, even as a
long-time feminist, to speak out against what has become an
increasingly popular rendition of feminist thinking.''
   ``What the Wellesley protesters have inadvertently revealed is
how much the original goals of the women's movement have been
distorted by the male-clone careerism of today's `dress for
success' feminists,'' she said.
   Susie Cardenas, a senior who helped push the petition, did not
return several messages to her dorm telephone.
   Lorraine Garnett Ward, dean for the 600-member Class of 1990,
defended the petitioners, although she pointed out they do not
represent a majority of senior class.
   ``Wellesley College students are extremely thoughtful people who
are not at all whiney,'' Ward said. ``I think this is a college
which encourages young women to think _ and think aloud.''
   Feminist author Betty Friedan said she had no problem with the
choices Mrs. Bush made in her life, but added the first lady should
use her influence to help other women.
   ``The choice to marry and the opportunity to exert influence as
first lady is to be envied, but it is also to be used,'' said
Friedan, who teaches at the University of Southern California.
``What I would do is say, `We challenge you to take a leading role
in demanding that this nation take a leading role on child care.' ''
   A spokeswoman for Eleanor Smeal, former president of the
National Organization for Women, who now heads the Virginia-based
group The Feminist Majority, treaded a careful line when talking
about Mrs. Bush.
   ``Our impression is that if for instance it was an Eleanor
Roosevelt, who was someone who really used her role to improve the
status of women, this probably wouldn't be happening,'' said Tamar
Raphael, after speaking with Smeal. ``We know Barbara Bush is
really for women's rights, but she really hasn't used her position
yet to do that.''
   Several students said the timing of the protest made them uneasy.
   ``I'm primarily a little embarrassed just because I feel we
invited her and it's a slap in the face,'' said Erica Herz, a
senior. ``There are a lot of people who are happy she's coming.''
   Marcy Goldstein, a junior, said, ``It would be wonderful to have
such a well-known person on campus.''
   Mrs. Bush still plans to attend the June 1 graduation
ceremonies, according to her press office.

<HEAD>Poachers Kill Rhino Popular With Tourists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poachers have killed a rhinoceros seen by
nearly every visitor to a game reserve where she had claimed a
domain for herself and a male calf.
   Richard Leakey, the director of state Wildlife Management
Service, said investigations were underway in the southwestern
Masai Mara Game Reserve on the death of the black rhino, nicknamed
Halima.
   Halima is a common name for women along Kenya's Indian Ocean
coast.
   ``The animal was killed by unknown person or persons using a
high-powered rifle,'' said Leakey in a statement Monday.
   Leakey deplored what he called ``senseless killing of a well
known tourist attraction'' and said Halima's horn had been
recovered.
   Halima, who left a year-old male orphan calf, permanently lived
in a place called Musiala in the game reserve, and her defiance of
migratory habits made it possible for every interested park visitor
to see her.
   Rhinos are normally killed for their horn, which is then ground
into a powder that is considered an aphrodisiac in the Far East.
The horn is also used to make ornate handles for daggers in Persian
Gulf countries.
   Poachers, cashing in on the demand for rhino horns, have reduced
the animal's population in the East African nation from 20,000 in
the late 1970s to an estimated 400 at present, most of them in
sanctuaries.
   Conservationists say the slaughter of wildlife, particularly
elephants and rhinos, has been reduced dramatically since Leakey
became Kenya's director of wildlife management early 1988.

   In what appeared a drug-related mob hit,
masked gunmen killed five people and wounded seven as they opened
fire inside a coffee bar and at occupants of a car parked outside,
authorities said.
   Tuesday's slaughter was carried out in the style of the Camorra,
a crime syndicate that is a rough equivalent of the Sicilian mafia,
said investigating Magistrate Paolo Albano.
   He said it appeared the killings were part of battles over the
flourishing illegal drug trade in the area.
   The attack occurred in the early hours in the hamlet of
Pescopago, about 20 miles north of Naples.
   The dead included two Tanzanians, one Iranian and one Italian.
Police said they could not immediately identify the other dead.
   Among the wounded was the 13-year-old son of the coffee bar's
owner.
   Doctors operating on one of the wounded, a 23-year-old
Tanzanian, found 10 bags filled with heroin in his stomach, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   ``There are Africans who sell drugs here, and the massacre is
either directed towards the Africans who are operating on their own
or towards Africans whom the Camorra supplies with drugs,'' Albano
said.

   Some people might think that fussing over a name
is much ado about nothing, but those people aren't named
Shakespeare.
   Of those who are, about 115 turned up to celebrate the Bard's
birthday Tuesday at the site of the new Globe Theater. It was the
largest gathering of Shakespeares since 1964, which was celebrated
as the playwright's 400th birthday. All seemed proud of their
illustrious name.
   Of course, it may be that none of the latterday Shakespeares is
related to England's premier playwright. Genealogies are hazy on
this point.
   But never mind.
   ``We all like to think we're related to the Bard,'' said Stanley
Shakespeare, a London hairdresser, who pored through phonebooks for
six months to compile the invitation list of 600 Shakespeares
throughout Britain.
   He's not picky. Invitations went to people named Shakespear,
Shakspear, Shaxper and other variations.
   Those who came to London will be guests of honor at a week of
readings, dinner parties, films and concerts organized by the
Friends of Shakespeare's Globe. But for most of the Shakespeares,
the important thing was being together as a family.
   ``These Shakespeares are all fantastic, really friendly and we
all feel a natural empathy with each other, even though most of us
have never met before,'' said 33-year-old Phil Shakespeare, a
supermarket manager in West Bromsgrove near Stratford-Upon-Avon,
the playwright's birthplace.
   He munched on a piece of fried chicken and chatted briefly with
a new acquaintance, 35-year-old Rosamund Shakespeare, who carried
10-month-old Hillary Shakespeare on her hip.
   Ms. Shakespeare said she kept her maiden name and passed it to
her daughter because ``I think it sounds nicer than my husband's
name _ Kukowski.''
   Besides, she added, she has always been fascinated by the
playwright and as a teen-ager hitchhiked with her brother to
Stratford-Upon-Avon, arriving long after dark.
   ``We couldn't find a room and slept on the steps of the Royal
Shakespeare Theater. I thought it so ironic that the Shakespeares
couldn't find a bed for the night in Stratford.
   ``The next day I put a rose on William's grave,'' she said.
   The Shakespeares donned yellow hardhats and visited the
construction site where a replica is being built of the Elizabethan
Globe Theater, the playhouse most closely associated with the Bard.
   A 30-foot-high banner bearing Shakespeare's portrait was
unfurled next door on the new Midland Bank building, also under
construction.
   Gangs of workers stopped drilling and hammering to listen to a
few lines from Henry V. Then, Gordon Schwontkowski of Cary, Ill.,
told the Shakespeares how he hand-painted the huge banner at night
in his high school gym as a donation to the theater project.
   The banner will hang at the worksite until the Globe opens in
1993.
   Last year, archaeologists uncovered the original theater about
300 yards from the new site on the south bank of the Thames. After
lunch, the Shakespeare clan visited the site.
   Carl Shakespeare lingered behind to enter his name in the
guestbook alongside the signatures of Stanley Shakespeare, Beryl
Shakespeare, Dorothy Shakespeare and the rest.
   The 25-year-old research chemist said he never felt any impulse
to write, although he was capable of turning a pretty phrase.
   ``When I was 13, I wrote a descriptive story about the wind
which my teacher said was the best she had ever read. She read it
aloud to the class and I must admit, it was pretty good,'' said
Shakespeare, who paused a moment to reflect.
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``Maybe there's a budding Shakespeare in
all of us.''

   Pump-it-up Arnold Schwarzenegger is mellowing

   The 42-year-old muscle man who won Mr. Universe five times, was
named Mr. Olympia seven times and starred in a series of hit movies
that grossed more than $1 billion says he is no longer ``as hungry,

   He drinks coffee, smokes cigars, is down to a trim 215 pounds
and professes to be a devoted daddy, treasuring the early morning
wake-up screams of his 2-month-old daughter, Katherine, according
to the May issue of GQ magazine.
   Schwarzenegger is married to NBC newswoman Maria Shriver.
   Learning to diaper the child proved to be a challenge. ``The

admitted.
   His latest movie, ``Total Recall,'' an adventure set in the

   Richard Nixon is moving on down to a
three-bedroom townhouse.
   The former president put a for-sale sign on his seven-bedroom
house in this northern New Jersey community and plans to move into
a three-bedroom, four-story townhouse in nearby Park Ridge,
spokesman John Taylor said Tuesday.
   ``The Nixons have decided that they would prefer to spend their
energy on activities other than maintaining a large house on four
acres,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor said he did not know the purchase price of the new home
or the asking price for the 15-room contemporary house in Saddle
River. The Nixons bought it in 1981 for $1.25 million and made
$300,000 in improvements, he said.

   Deciding that the potential profits for the city were too great

people living near the arena.
   One condition was that the city receive at least $325,000 from

   Concert promoter Jimmy Koplik, who is negotiating with both Yale

   Baseball umpire Bob Engel has been
charged with stealing 4,180 baseball cards from a store.
   Engel, 56, was released on $5,000 bail Saturday for arraignment
May 2 on misdemeanor counts of commercial burglary and petty theft,
police said Tuesday.
   A store security guard told police Engel put seven boxes of
cards valued at $144 into a brown paper bag he pulled from the
waistband of his pants.
   Police said Engel told them he took the cards to collect and
trade.
   Engel was back at the ballpark on Sunday, when he worked the Los
Angeles Dodgers game from first base.

   Kurt Masur, in his first visit to the New York
Philharmonic since being named music director, said he wants to
start a children's choir and have more rehearsal time for difficult
works.
   His five-year contract was announced two weeks ago. It starts in
the fall of 1992.
   Asked what changes he intends for the Philharmonic, the
62-year-old music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig
on Tuesday mentioned closer cooperation with the Juilliard School,
which is next door in Lincoln Center.
   ``I'm not one of those who is promising everything before the
election and then not doing it later,'' Masur said. ``I only can
promise you one thing: I will do this as honest as I did everything
in my life.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Seeks to Avoid Making `Wrong Mistakes' on
Sanctions</HEAD>

   When President Bush agonizes over a difficult
choice, as he's done this week on the issue of economic sanctions
against the Soviet Union, he sometimes likes to quote a favorite
philosopher, Yogi Berra.
   ``I love the old expression of Yogi Berra's _ you say, `what
happened to the Mets, Yogi?' He said, `Well, we made the wrong
mistakes,''' the president told a group of building contractors on
Tuesday.
   Bush used the words of the often verbally befuddled baseball
great to explain his decision _ at least for the moment _ not to
slap a series of economic penalties on the Soviet Union in response
to its crackdown in Lithuania.
   ``I expect in this job I'll make plenty of mistakes, but I don't
want to make the wrong mistakes,'' Bush said.
   Once again, the issue of sanctions was presenting a major
foreign policy dilemma for Bush.
   Just as he resisted imposing sanctions on China last year in the
aftermath of the bloody Tiananmen Square massacre, the president
once again finds himself under pressure from conservatives in
Congress to act more decisively.
   It was, to use another favorite Bush Berra-ism, ``deja vu _ all
over again.''
   Last summer, Bush finally imposed a series of non-economic
sanctions on the Beijing government, while saying he did not want
to go further for fear of hurting the Chinese people.
   Among those sanctions was a ban on high-level contacts between
governments. However, the president then sent national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft on a secret mission to express U.S.
feelings about the use of force against China's own citizens.
   When confronted with the apparent violation of his own
no-contact edict, Bush said he did not want to take any steps that
would isolate China from the community of nations.
   He now is making similar arguments for withholding sanctions
against the Soviet Union that would show U.S. displeasure with the
Kremlin's efforts to block Lithuanian independence.
   Administration sources said Bush marched to the brink of
announcing sanctions on Moscow _ only to back away, at least for
the moment, in response to skepticism from U.S. allies in Western
Europe over such a course and concern that U.S. sanctions could
only make matters worse.
   Explaining his reluctance, Bush said: ``You've got to look at
the real options. I'm old enough to remember Hungary in 1956 and
where we exhorted people to go to the barricades, and a lot of
people were left out there all alone.''
   The president used the same argument recently for explaining why
his administration would not formally recognize the new government
of Lithuania.
   The only sanctions Bush said he would consider are economic ones
_ and sources say these would deal mainly with withholding trade
and investment concessions that the United States was otherwise
prepared to grant Moscow.
   Economic links between the two superpowers right now are slight.
And Bush has repeatedly ruled out this government's main economic
leverage over the Soviet Union: a grain embargo.
   The Bush administration, and the Reagan administration before
it, has argued that the trouble with economic sanctions is that
they rarely work the way they are intended _ and often wind up
hurting the wrong people.
   Bush voiced such an argument over past sanctions against the
white minority rule government of South Africa. Economic penalties
now in place were imposed by Congress over Reagan-Bush
administration objections.
   More recently, the president _ yielding to congressional
pressure _ voiced support for keeping the sanctions in place
against Pretoria, even though he disputes their value.
   He has said they should remain on at least until more progress
is made toward a one-person, one-vote government.
   Ironically, in Central America, where U.S. sanctions have taken
a major toll on national economies, Bush is having a hard time
winning congressional support for undoing the impact of those
sanctions.
   Vice President Dan Quayle heads today for the inauguration of
Nicaraguan President-elect Violeta Chamorro without the aid Bush
promised her U.S.-backed government and the new government of
Panama.
   Years of U.S. economic sanctions against the leftist government
of outgoing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and the Panama
dictatorship of Manuel Antonio Noriega left both countries'
economies hobbled.
   The president's $800 million aid package for the two nations
remains stalled in Congress.
   Bush invoked the Yogi Berra ``wrong mistakes'' quote twice on
Tuesday. After he told it to a group of agricultural writers, he
added: ``You've got to think about that one. And I don't want to
make the wrong mistake.''

<TEXT>
   A fledgling Ohio politician is coming clean,
less than two weeks before a congressional primary election, in
hopes that voters will like a candidate who tells the truth about
telling a lie.
   Ricky Lee Mattox, a Democrat who wants to oust Republican Rep.
Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, confessed to using a masquerade to get
Lukens to explain the secrets of his past successes.
   Using another name and posing as a college student researching a
paper on political strategy, Mattox asked Lukens to map out the
tactics he used to win election and re-election.
   Lukens obliged.
   Although embroiled in the worst political mess of his
20-plus-year career, the congressman met with his would-be rival at
a restaurant in Middletown, Ohio, in February and described how to
win in the 8th District.
   ``What he said was, `I would never tell one of my opponents
this, but...''' Mattox said from Oxford, Ohio. ``He confided in me
tactics about his first and second campaigns that I thought were
brilliant.
   ``I came out of the meeting with a lot of respect for him,'' the
28-year-old Mattox said. ``I've never met anyone with as much
political knowledge.''
   Lukens said Tuesday that he remembered meeting Mattox. ``He
seemed receptive. He seemed like a nice guy,'' the incumbent said.
   ``I am a little surprised that Ricky would go to that extent,''
Lukens said. ``If he had just told me he was Ricky Mattox I would
have given the same advice.''
   But would he have gone into the same step-by-step detail?
   ``Oh, sure,'' replied Lukens. ``There's no secret about it.
There's nothing magic. The key is timing and application.''
   Lukens then detailed how he goes about working the district,
beginning with tiny farm towns and ending in the cities.
   His description matched exactly Mattox's inventory of Lukens'
campaign tactics. It also matched second-hand accounts of Lukens'
own activities as he struggles for his political life while
uncertain of the outcome of his appeal for a sex-related
misdemeanor involving a teen-age girl.
   Lukens has been highly visible in his district, making the
rounds of service-club breakfasts, farm group meetings and other
small gatherings.
   Lukens has steered clear of Republican meetings and candidate
forums, since his official stance is that he's waiting for the 10th
Ohio District Court of Appeals to settle the challenge of his
conviction for contributing to the unruliness of a minor.
   Mattox hasn't followed Lukens' advice.
   Lukens advocates steering clear of areas where opponents are
strong and concentrating instead on ``where the ducks are.'' Mattox
spent a lot of time going door-to-door in Hamilton, Ohio, the
hometown of his chief Democratic rival, Gregory Jolivette.
   Lukens told Mattox that a year of advance work was a basic
requirement. Mattox launched his campaign three months before the
May 8 primary.
   But that doesn't mean Mattox didn't value the deceptively
gathered strategy. ``If I were running a full-scale campaign I
would follow the strategy exactly,'' he said.
   Mattox maintained he had nowhere else to turn as a Democratic
candidate in a district that had sent Republicans to Congress for a
generation.
   ``I wasn't receiving any advice from the Democratic Party
here,'' he said. ``I wasn't receiving any help.''
   Mattox, who has never before sought elective office, admitted he
was going public with his subterfuge out of desperation because his
campaign has attracted little attention.
   While he was in a confessional mood, Mattox also admitted that
he has been deliberately misleading about how he has made ends meet
since his medical discharge from the Navy.
   The former missile technician routinely describes himself as a
data base operator for Essenza Corp.
   He now says that is true, but not precisely accurate.
   Mattox actually punches ordering information into the computers
at Essenza's SDS Pizza near the Miami University campus in Oxford.
He said the job is part-time, temporary and chosen for flexible
hours during the campaign.

   Greg Weiler volunteered to work on a
committee studying traffic problems, only to resign because freeway
gridlock kept him from attending the meetings.
   Weiler missed two recent 7:30 a.m. meetings because he was
trapped in traffic on Interstate 5.
   ``I can't participate in planning the traffic solutions because
the traffic is so bad I can't get there,'' Weiler said.
   The real estate lawyer had served on the citizens advisory
committee to the Orange County Transportation Commission for five
years.
   Weiler wrote his resignation letter after spending 75 minutes
stuck on the freeway.
   ``Such a commute is enough to cool the ardor of the most
passionate volunteer,'' Weiler wrote. ``Henceforth, I will limit my
public service to activities that keep me off Interstate 5.''
   Committee chairman Bill Daly said he understands why Weiler
quit. Some mornings, the committee has trouble getting a
nine-member quorum because of traffic, he said.

   L. Montgomery Shepard got tired of
being called a tightwad for giving a mere $100 reward to the child
who found his wife's jewelry-laden purse.
   So last week he gave Jennifer Hawkins of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
a check for $1,000. She earlier received $1,000 for being honest
from a civic group.
   ``The letters we're getting are just terrible. We're not
cheapskates,'' Shepard said.
   Jennifer found the purse outside a hotel as she and her father
were jogging March 2. Shepard said his wife, Betty, had dropped it
there while they were vacationing.
   The pocketbook contained about $15,000 in jewelry and $2,600 in
cash, Shepard said. But news reports that the purse held about
$200,000 in jewelry apparently inspired a flurry of derisive
letters to the Shepards.
   Shepard, who is active in the Republican Party, said he even got
sniping comments from ranking GOP leaders in Washington.

   Already they're saying it's the
biggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to a
telescope.
   So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of the
universe. See how big it is. Learn its age. Look at light created
14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.
   Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the Big
Bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago. See stars born and see
them die. Watch galaxies form. Follow the flow of gas into the
Milky Way's halo. Peer deep into the universe, past so many stars
in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime
to count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200
billion stars.
   For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes
possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the
Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen
before. The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck,
has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light.
   Light, speeding along at 186,000 miles a second, is the
messenger of creation. Tracking the trail of light from today to
the first moments contains all the information we will ever have
about the creation of the universe.
   The Hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to
the first echoes of creation. This is a world-class event, even if
astronomy is not your thing.
   Superlatives?
   ``In the history of optical astronomy there have been two great
leaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in the
autumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990.'' _
Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore.
   One more?
   ``No one ever made anything that good,'' James Westphal,
California Institute of Technology.
   Another?
   Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that the
Hubble telescope ``will literally be the dawn of a new era in
astronomy.''
   Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance. But the HST, named
after Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind of promise.
   Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who
concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth
but that the farther away they are, the faster they move. The
theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the
universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is
still rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.
   Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion
years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible
speed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed into
galaxies, stars and planets.
   There are bigger telescopes than the Hubble, but they are all on
Earth and all subject to a major limitation _ the atmosphere _
which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through. The
problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to
birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.
   The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views of
Earth's sister planets, had to travel 12 years to get close enough
for pictures as they whizzed past. With the Hubble, says scientist
Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.
   The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inch
primary mirror that gathers incoming light.
   ``On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles
away,'' says Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.
``With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000
miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from
Washington.''

<HEAD>Navy Would Close Some Bases Still Under Construction</HEAD>

   Home ports under construction in New York,
Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Washington state are among 34
military installations the Navy is considering for possible closure.
   A three-page list of Navy recommendations for closure,
realignment and consolidation surfaced Tuesday during a hearing by
two House Armed Services subcommittees.
   The list drew immediate criticism from a lawmaker who released
the document, and a Navy statement that it was a preliminary
compilation and not a ``hit list.''
   The Pentagon ``politically wants us to open and close bases at
the same time,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., who opposes
continued spending on new home ports nationwide.
   Vice Adm. Stanley R. Arthur identified the list as candidates
for closure and realignment drafted by Navy officials.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, said later that the
list was an informal document that is part of the early stages of
the service's review of all shore establishments. The review is
expected to be completed by July or August.
   ``Appearance of a facility ... in no way indicates it's on some
hit list,'' Quigley said.
   Lawmakers also reacted angrily in January to Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney's plan to close or scale back 72 domestic bases and 14
overseas installations.
   Democrats including Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, criticized Cheney's list as
partisan for singling out bases in Democratic districts.
   Navy officials appeared before the House Armed Services seapower
and military installations subcommittees Tuesday to discuss
``strategic home porting,'' under which the Navy's fleet of 550
ships are spread among 41 ports.
   ``Strategic home porting remains a valid military objective
because of its beneficial effect on peacetime readiness,'' said
Jacqueline Schafer, assistant secretary of the Navy for
installations and environment.
   She indicated, however, that the Navy is reviewing all its
installations, including the new home ports, for possible closure
and realignments.
   According to the list, closing the home port on Staten Island,
N.Y., which is 90 percent complete, would cost $142 million and
result in annual savings of $7 million.
   Navy spokesman Quigley said Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III
met with New York Mayor David Dinkins and stressed that the service
plans to base its ships at Staten Island.
   Shutting down the facility at Everett, Wash., the least
developed of the home ports, would cost $20 million. Annual savings
were estimated at $22 million.
   The other home ports on the list are in Ingleside, Texas;
Mobile, Ala.; and Pascagoula, Miss.
   Among other installations on the list were those at Hunter's
Point, Calif., and Sand Point, Wash.; a naval air station in
Brunswick, Maine; and a naval supply school in Athens, Ga., home
state of the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn.
   The list also included consolidating 13 facilities, including
two at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; two in Michigan; two
in Oregon, and three in Wisconsin, Aspin's home state.
   The Navy is considering keeping open six facilities that had
been included on Cheney's list as candidates for closure or
realignment. All are in California, including the naval station in
Alameda and the shipyard in Long Beach.
   At Tuesday's hearing, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, recommended that the Defense
Department withhold additional money for the home port projects due
to the changing situation worldwide, fiscal constraints and the
unlikely chances of a 600-ship naval fleet ever being built.
   The GAO also estimated that the cost of building and operating
the new home ports would exceed $1 billion, compared with the
Pentagon's initial cost estimate of $799 million.

<TEXT>
   A woman unlucky in love found good fortune in
divorce when a paperwork error delayed her marital split long
enough for her husband to win the lottery.
   On Tuesday, a state appeals court upheld a judge's ruling
cutting Bonita Lynch in for $550,000 of her ex-husband's winnings.
   ``Fortune favored husband with a jackpot, but, because his
marriage had not ended, fortune dealt his wife a share,'' Judge
Noel Fidel wrote for the three-judge appeals panel. ``Though the
lottery was a windfall, spouses marry for better or for worse and
share no less in windfalls than in labor's wages.''
   Ms. Lynch had been living apart from her husband, Michael, for
about two years when she testified at an uncontested divorce
hearing on Feb. 10, 1987 that their marriage was irretrievably
broken.
   She should have gotten her divorce that day, but her lawyers had
given her husband the wrong date for the hearing, forcing a delay.
The matter still wasn't final 11 days later when her husband won
$2.2 milllion in the state lottery.
   Lynch, a computer expert, had bought the ticket with Donna
Williams, a girlfriend he married after the divorce became final.
He died last Oct. 30, but his widow fought on behalf of his estate
to keep his first wife from taking a cut.
   Under Tuesday's ruling, Lynch's widow gets to keep half the $2.2
million jackpot because half the ticket was hers to begin with. The
remaining $1.1 million will be split evenly between Lynch's first
wife and his estate.
   ``In Arizona, `it ain't over till it's over,''' said Bonita
Lynch's attorney, Kenneth J. Love, borrowing from Yogi Berra. Love
said Ms. Lynch had no comment on the ruling and did not want any
details about her released.
   J. Douglas McVay, a lawyer for Lynch's widow, said no decision
has been made on an appeal.
   A call to a Phoenix-area listing for Donna Lynch was not
immediately returned Tuesday.
   Michael and Bonita Lynch married in 1968 and separated in 1985.
He began living with Donna Williams in 1986. Bonita Lynch filed for
divorce the same year. After Lynch won the lottery, she filed for a
share of the winnings.
   Superior Court Judge Rufus Coulter awarded her a share on the
grounds all assets acquired during a marriage are community
property.
   Lynch appealed, saying that his ``will to union'' with his first
wife had ended by Feb. 10 and that it was her lawyers who made the
mistake.
   The appeals panel rejected the arguments, saying that the
paperwork errors were unintentional.
   ``This case displays the hand of chance,'' Fidel wrote.
   The appeals court also said it was unclear when the ``will to
union'' was really broken because the couple discussed
reconciliation through much of the separation.
   As late as 1987, Bonita Lynch helped her former husband ``in a
medical emergency, checked him into an alcoholic rehabilitation
program, and agreed to join him in family counseling,'' the court
said.

<HEAD>After 50 Years, US Weighs Ties with Albania</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than 50 years, the United States is
ready to pursue normal diplomatic relations with Albania despite
its reputation as one of the world's most rigid police states.
   The State Department responded favorably on Tuesday to a
statement last week in which Albanian President Ramiz Alia
expressed interest in establishing diplomatic ties. He made the
same overture to the Soviet Union.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, in a statement,
referred only indirectly to Albania's human rights record.
   ``Establishment of diplomatic relations would create the
opportunity for dialogue through which we would be able to
communicate our concerns and encourage respect for human rights in
Albania,'' she said.
   Albania has been one of the world's most reclusive nations for
years, shunning diplomatic ties with all but a few countries while
preserving its status as a bulwark of orthodox communism.
   It is the only European country that has refused to participate
in the 35-nation grouping than addresses issues related to
continental security and cooperation.
   But Alia's speech a week ago, in addition to making overtures to
Washington and Moscow, indicated an interest in Albanian membership
in the European group formed 15 years ago in Helsinki.
   The most recent State Department report on human rights
conditions worldwide, released in February, said Albanians are
``permitted only very limited civil and political rights'' under
their Marxist government.
   The death penalty can be imposed for such non-violent crimes as
unauthorized attempts to emigrate or for anti-government propaganda.
   Albania officially has been an atheist state since 1967. More
than 2,100 religious structures were shut down and many religious
leaders were persecuted, imprisoned or executed for continuing
their religious functions, the report said.
   Information about specific human rights abuses has been
difficult to obtain because of strict official censorship.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, has
said that repeated appeals to Albanian authorities for the release
of prisoners of conscience have not been answered.
   One sign that Albania has begun to open up was its decision to
grant a visa to Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, D-Mass. He is scheduled to
visit Albania during the first week in June.
   He is believed to be the first representative of the U.S.
government to visit Albania since relations were broken before
World War II.
   James Mahoney, Kennedy's executive assistant, said Tuesday that
the congressman intends to explore opportunities for cooperation
with Albania.
   As for human rights, ``we'll be looking at those issues before
departure,'' Mahoney said.
   State Department officials said Albania had been sending out
feelers to the U.S. government expressing interest in broader
contacts. The overtures began about six months ago, apparently at
the time when other communist regimes in Eastern Europe were
collapsing.
   Thus far, however, Albania has been spared the kind of upheaval
that has taken place elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Albania has never been a member of the East bloc and looked with
disdain on those governments, accusing them of ideological
deviationism.

<HEAD>Study Finds Many Smokers Often Don't Ask Before Lighting Up</HEAD>

   Common courtesy often goes up in smoke when it
comes to lighting up indoors. Smokers do not ask first, and
non-smokers are unwilling to kick butts, researchers say.
   Half of the smokers surveyed said they light up indoors without
asking anyone if they mind, according to a study in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   And despite the habit's declining social acceptability,
non-smokers are reluctant to ask smokers not to puff. Even though
about 90 percent of non-smokers consider secondhand smoke annoying
and harmful, the study found, just 5 percent asked people to put
out their cigarettes in 1974 and 1987.
   ``The low percentage is striking, given that most non-smokers
are annoyed by secondhand smoke and consider it harmful to their
health,'' the researchers wrote. ``A plausible explanation is a
desire to avoid a confrontation.''
   The survey of 22,043 people found that the proportion of smokers
who say they don't smoke in indoor public places rose from 5
percent in 1974 to 33 percent in 1987.
   The study also found that when they are inside public places
that have no rules on smoking, 21 percent of smokers will light up
without hesitation and 26 percent will look around first to see if
others are smoking, then light up.
   Fourteen percent will ask others if they mind before lighting
up, 33 percent will refrain from smoking and 5 percent will do
``something else.''
   In Washington on Tuesday, Tobacco Institute spokeswoman Brennan
Dawson said the survey's findings that just 21 percent of smokers
light up without hesitation demonstrate ``an enormous application
of common courtesy.''
   ``We are all taught as children to play nicely together,'' she
said. ``And that travels over into adulthood, or at least it
should. Smokers are doing a lot of different things, according to
this, to play nicely.''
   But the study's lead researcher, Dr. Ronald M. Davis of the
Centers for Disease Control, said it will take laws _ and not just
courtesy _ to dissuade many smokers from lighting up around
non-smokers.
   ``The bottom line is that most non-smokers are suffering in
silence,'' said Davis, director of the CDC Office on Smoking and
Health at Rockville, Md.
   Davis noted that surveys have found 29 percent of Americans
smoked in 1987, compared with 40 percent in 1965 and 44 percent in
1949.
   The article said that authorities have concluded that passive
smoking causes lung cancer in non-smokers and that a report
estimated passive smoking causes 3,800 lung cancer deaths among
non-smokers each year in the United States.
   The researchers' data were based on results from the 1987
National Health Interview Survey of Cancer Epidemiology and Control
and compared with surveys conducted by the Roper Organization in
1974, 1976 and 1978. The 1987 nationwide, random survey's margin of
error was plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEAD>East Germany to Allow 100 Percent Foreign Ownership of Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany plans to permit 100
percent foreign ownership of businesses, a newspaper quotes the
economics minister of the formerly Communist country as saying.
   Gerhard Pohl says East Germany will repeal recent laws that
restrict foreign ownership in joint ventures to 49 percent, the
Hamburg-based Bild newspaper reported today.
   Many foreign companies have shied away from investments in East
Germany because of restrictions limiting investors to a minority
share.
   ``We are pulling back the joint venture legislation of the
Modrow government,'' Bild quoted Pohl as saying.
   The interim government of former East German Communist Premier
Hans Modrow introduced the restrictive legislation earlier this
year.
   Pohl was quoted as telling the mass-circulation daily that the
new laws will be passed ``very soon.'' But he added that East
Germans will receive preferential treatment in investments, Bild
said.

   Roughage has found its champion in the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which argues you've
got to eat green food if you're going to be an environmentalist.
   Eschew meat and save the Earth, says this outfit; eat salads and
preserve the rain forests.
   ``If you're a meat eater, you are contributing to the
destruction of the environment, whether you know it or not,'' says
Neal D. Bernard, president of the 30,000-member committee, which
observed Earth Day by passing out recipes for vegetarian chili and
black beans and rice.
   ``Clearly the best thing you can do for the Earth is to not
support animal agriculture,'' says Bernard, 36, a 1980 graduate of
the George Washington University School of Medicine and the nephew
of two Illinois cattle raisers.
   Mainstream environmentalists say he's gone too far and the
National Cattlemen's Association picks a bone with him.
   ``The claim that to be a proper environmentalist you can't be a
meat-eater is a bunch of bull,'' says cattlemen's spokeswoman Alisa
Harrison. ``There is no current sound scientific evidence that
shows that by being a vegetarian you're going to be a better user
of natural resources.''
   ``We don't have a problem with people choosing to become
vegetarians,'' Ms. Harrison says. ``What we don't like is groups
like the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine spreading
false rumors about our use of natural resources. They're misleading
and they're not based on scientific evidence.''
   But Bernard cites statistics to make his case:
   _It takes 39 times more energy to produce beef than soybeans
having the same caloric value.
   _Producing enough food to feed a meat-eater requires 4,200
gallons of water a day; to feed a vegetarian requires 300 gallons.
   _Nearly 4 billion tons of topsoil are lost each year in the
United States, chiefly because of overgrazing by livestock and
unsustainable methods of growing feed.
   _Tropical rain forest is being cleared in Latin America to raise
cattle; a pound of hamburger represents 55 square feet of
burned-off forest.
   _Intensive cattle raising produces mountains of manure, a source
of methane gas, contributor to the greenhouse effect.
   Most environmentalists don't catch the connection until he
spells it out for them, Bernard says.
   ``They picture a pastoral scene, a few cows grazing and a few
chickens clucking,'' he says. ``Little do they know that cows are
raised on enormous feedlots for a portion of their lives and you
can't keep the manure from running off into streams. By and large,
raising animals for food is a very unfriendly industry from an
environmental viewpoint.''
   Other environmentalists have a ``yes, but'' response.
   ``It's like saying if you drive a car you can't be a good
environmentalist,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist at
the Environmental Defense Fund, who sees a ``holier than thou''
mentality at work in Bernard's scenario.
   ``If their point is to draw attention to the effects of
meat-eating and let people weigh that in deciding what to do
environmentally, that's understandable,'' Oppenheimer said.
``Meat-eating is one of the things a lot of Americans do in excess
and could cut down on and do the environment a favor.''
   Added Paul Allen, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, ``You can be a vegetarian and still be a lousy
environmentalist if you're not active and involved.''
   Allen said his group serves mostly fruit and cheese when it has
a reception, ``but that may be more a function of our not being
able to afford shrimp.''

   Four sons left Joaquina Garcia nine
years ago to join the Contra rebels and she has not seen them
since. Now that the rebels are disarming she hopes to find them _
``if they're still alive.''
   Like dozens of other anxious parents and relatives, Mrs. Garcia,
46, plans to spend two days in a nearby U.N. administered security
zone searching for the young men. Rebels are gathering in five such
zones, where they are to surrender their weapons before returning
home.
   ``They went to war nine years ago, when they were barely 11, 13,
17 and 18 years old. I don't know if they're alive or dead,'' Mrs.
Garcia said Monday.
   She said her husband also ``fled toward Honduras'' five years
ago, leaving her alone with five small children and a little farm
perched on a rocky mountain slope.
   There she grows beans and corn and also takes care of a girl a
Contra woman gave birth to four years ago and then abandoned.
   ``I have been suffering bitterly,'' Mrs. Garcia said.
   The U.S.-supported Contra rebels were supposed to gather in the
security zones before President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
takes office today.
   By Tuesday, Sandinista troops had pulled out of the La Rica area
in northern Nicaragua together with armed civilians who guarded a
Sandinista-run cooperative.
   The Contras, an estimated 9,000-strong inside Nicaragua, have
agreed to disarm by June 10.
   The La Rica zone was opened Monday and is run by Gen. Agustin
Quesada, the Spanish commander of a United Nations observation
force. The area includes a camp which can house 2,000 Contras.
   On Monday a small group of rebels, among the first to arrive,
sat on the banks of a river chatting with friends and relatives and
washing their fatigues. They still carried their Soviet-designed
AK-47 assault rifles, and some were carrying hand grenades and
small missiles.
   Many echoed their leaders and said they would demand that the
Nicaraguan army be disarmed and purged of its Sandinista leaders.
Sandinista officers have agreed to give up their party posts while
retaining military positions.
   ``If the Sandinistas continue where they are, then we have
fought in vain,'' said a 30-year-old Contra who identified himself
only as ``Rubi.''
   ``The nine must leave,'' he added, referring to the nine
Commanders of the Sandinista Revolution who led the insurrection
that overthrew Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship in July 1979.
   One of the commanders is Gen. Humberto Ortega, the outgoing
defense minister. He stepped down from his party post on Monday but
is to stay on as army chief.
   At the Sandinista-run cooperative farm at Las Colinas, one mile
south of La Rica, residents said they no longer feared the Contras.
   Three years ago at least seven people died in a Contra attack on
the small cooperative of 30 metal-roofed homes.
   Justina Ortez, whose 22-year-old son was killed defending the
cooperative, said she does not fear the Contras.
   A rebel who called himself ``Danilo'' walked through the
settlement, trying to reassure residents. ``The ones you have to
fear are the nine'' of the Sandinista directorate, he kept saying.
   On the road linking this village to Managua, 150 miles to the
north, were three bridges and two Sandinista army trucks destroyed
by the Contras.
   Asked about this, one of the rebels shrugged. ``Dona Violeta
(Chamorro) is going to have a lot of work,'' he said.

   Savings and loan bailout officials disagree
over whether to offer price discounts to speed the sale of
repossessed real estate.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, who regulates
nationally chartered banks, warned of the consequences that
discounts could have for struggling S&amp;Ls and banks operating in
fragile real estate markets.
   However, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., pointed to the potential escalation of taxpayer
costs if property sales are delayed.
   The board of the Resolution Trust Corp. on Tuesday postponed
action on the issue for two weeks after the two officials voiced
their disagreements. It had been set to consider a plan that would
have allowed the agency to sell properties as much as 20 percent to
30 percent below their appraised value.
   Seidman is chairman of the RTC board, which is conducting the
cleanup of failed S&amp;Ls, and Clarke is a member.
   ``I think we have to be awfully careful,'' Clarke said. ``We
have a number of (solvent) institutions out in the marketplace
holding an awful lot of property ... that we'd like to keep out of
the RTC. I'm not sure we know as much about the broader
consequences ... as we should.''
   The agency's current policy is to sell no property in six
distressed states _ Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, New
Mexico and Arkansas _ for less than 95 percent of its appraised
value. It is intended to prevent properties from being ``dumped,''
sending depressed properties even lower.
   However, agency officials are having difficulty attracting bids
close to the appraised price and want to offer a reduced price
without a costly and time-consuming second appraisal.
   Also, in some areas of the country, qualified appraisers are
hard to find because RTC ethics rules preclude hiring anyone
implicated in an S&amp;L failure.
   Seidman, while agreeing to the two-week delay, said, ``We are
sitting here with billions of dollars of property which is costing
us huge amounts of money as long as we keep it.''
   ``We've got to convince bidders they can get a bargain from us.
... Otherwise, we won't have any customers,'' he said. ``... The
first citizen volunteering to buy out of patriotic motives has yet
to come forward.''
   The policy under consideration would permit the RTC to sell
property for 85 percent of appraised value after it had gone unsold
for six months, or four months in the case of single-family homes.
It would allow an additional 5 percent cut after three more months.
   The plan also would allow the agency to sell properties at
well-advertised auctions for as little a 70 percent of appraised
value or, in the case of properties appraised at less than
$100,000, for the highest bid regardless of the appraisal.
   The proposal drew praise from analysts who complain real estate
sales so far have been too slow. They said that after the changes
the agency would still comply with last summer's S&amp;L bailout law,
which requires properties in distressed areas be sold at 95 percent
of ``market value'' rather than appraised value.
   ``Market value is not what an appraisal says it is. It's what a
buyer is willing to pay,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research organization. ``As long as you
have a sufficient number of bidders, that is the market price.''
   Joseph E. Robert Jr., chairman of J.E. Robert Companies, an
Alexandria, Va., real estate management firm, said he doubted
prices would be further depressed by quicker sales.
   ``The market has already taken into consideration the overhang
and the fact that the RTC has this property,'' he said.
   In a related matter, a Bush administration official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Peter Monroe, a deputy assistant
housing secretary, is the leading candidate for a top position in
the bailout operation.
   He is set to replace William Taylor as president of the RTC
Oversight Board, the Treasury Department-led panel that oversees
the policy and purestrings of the bailout operation. Seidman's
board has overall supervision.
   Taylor, a Federal Reserve Board regulator, has been serving in
the position temporarily for four months since Daniel Kearney quit
amid reports that he believed the Treasury Department was giving
him too little authority.

   Big-city mayors say they can't fight a war on
drugs without more money to battle the poverty, hopelessness and
despair that fuels the drug problem.
   ``We are fighting the war on drugs in America today in large
part because our nation has not prevailed in the war on poverty,''
Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire said as more than 100 mayors
concluded a two-day meeting Tuesday with police chiefs on the drug
problem.
   Some Democratic mayors leveled a blast at federal drug policy
chief William Bennett, saying he was ignoring drug treatment,
education and poverty.
   Bennett, told of their comments, shot back: ``Some of these
folks think leadership is coming to Washington twice a year and
complaining.''
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn called Bennett ``a little bit
hypocritical'' for focusing on law enforcement and failing to
address the hopelessness that drives inner-city youths to drug
abuse and the drug trade.
   New York Mayor David Dinkins said Bennett, who was secretary of
education in the Reagan administration, had ``sent exactly the
wrong signal'' by suggesting drug education programs don't work.
   ``Bennett's repudiation of drug education was a cynical
statement from the man who ran the Education Department through the
era of `just say no,''' Dinkins said. ``But it was a typical
example of the type of leadership we're getting from Washington _
leadership that says we have more needs and then gives us less.''
   Their comments came a day after Bennett addressed the gathering
and encountered only gently challenging questions.
   ``What's with these guys?'' Bennett said in an interview after
their remarks Tuesday. ``I was there yesterday ... Did they wait
until I leave and then snipe at me?''
   Bennett called Dinkins' remarks ``New York bull.'' He said he
had never repudiated drug education but had said that education
alone was not sufficient to keep young people away from drugs.
   The mayors issued a closing statement urging the Bush
administration to reverse itself on its opposition to providing
federal aid directly to the cities to fight drugs, rather than
routing it through the states. Mayors contend states have delayed
or kept the drug enforcement money for themselves.
   The mayors said the war on drugs cannot be fought without
addressing urban poverty, joblessness and despair that encourages
people to seek escape through drugs and makes drug dealing the
easiest route to affluence.
   Whitmire said the mayors want more money for the Head Start
program for disadvantaged pre-schoolers, for job training for
abusers and for drug treatment programs for anyone who wants it.
   ``We can no longer conceive of winning the war unless we are
able to offer the most basic economic opportunities to all members
of our communities,'' she said.
   Flynn, at a news conference, disputed Bennett's assertions that
overall drug use is down and that most drug abusers have jobs.
Flynn said casual drug use may be declining but addiction and
drug-related violence is increasing.
   ``The problem of drugs in this country is getting worse and
worse,'' Flynn said. ``It's not getting better.''
   Don Hamilton, Bennett's press secretary, responding to Dinkins'
comments, said federal grants to states for drug education has
almost doubled under the Bush administration, from $288 million in
1989 to a proposed $488 million for fiscal 1991.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is giving up its
10-month fight to win Senate confirmation of a former civilian
nuclear power regulator as head of the nation's atomic weapons
production.
   In a letter to President Bush released Tuesday, Victor Stello
Jr. withdrew his name from consideration, saying he believed the
president needed to find someone who could win confirmation to the
sensitive job ``at the earliest opportunity.''
   ``It has become clear to me that I cannot be that person,''
Stello wrote in the letter dated April 20.
   Greenpeace and other national environmental groups, as well as
prominent members of Congress, strenuously opposed Stello's
nomination. They accused him of improper behavior during parts of
his 24 years with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has
jurisdiction over civilian nuclear reactors.
   Stello was the NRC's chief staff official before he came to the
Energy Department on temporary assignment last July after Bush
nominated him for the weapons chief's job.
   ``Given his questionable record on health and safety issues at
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Victor Stello should not have
been nominated for this job in the first place,'' Sen. Timothy
Wirth, D-Colo., said in response to Stello's withdrawal. Wirth
helped lead the campaign against Stello's confirmation.
   Among the accusations against Stello is that he altered agency
rules at the request of nuclear utilities, to the detriment of
safety, and that he authorized cash payments to an informer as part
of a personal vendetta within the NRC.
   In two confirmation hearing appearances before the Senate Armed
Services Committee last fall, Stello strongly denied that he acted
improperly. He asserted that nuclear safety was his primary concern
and that he was well suited for the job.
   The withdrawal of the Stello nomination ends an extraordinary
chapter in the administration's effort to revitalize the crippled
nuclear weapons complex by putting an experienced nuclear power
expert in charge for the first time.
   Key elements of the weapons complex, which include 17 major
production plants and laboratories in 12 states, are shut down
because of safety and management problems.
   Tom Olson, an Energy Department spokesman, said Stello would
remain at the department in a civil service job that does not
require Senate confirmation. His responsibilities will include
overseeing efforts to restart idled reactors at the Savannah River
nuclear weapons plant in South Carolina, Olson said.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said during the Senate
hearings that Stello was the only qualified person willing to take
the job.
   Olson said Tuesday evening that Watkins had no comment on
Stello's withdrawal.
   The Armed Services Committee was set to recommend Stello's
confirmation in January but balked upon learning that he was the
focus of an investigation by David Williams, the NRC inspector
general.
   Williams is investigating allegations that Stello and other NRC
officials pursued a vendetta against Roger Fortuna, who was in
charge of investigating wrongdoing at nuclear plants. The
allegation was that Stello believed Fortuna was too hard on the
industry.
   The results of Williams' investigation have not been made
public, but in his letter to Bush, Stello noted that the Armed
Services Committee planned to hold up further consideration of his
nomination until it reviewed them.
   ``My experience over this past year has led me to the conclusion
that final action by the Senate on my nomination will not take
place in the foreseeable future,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Exxon Cutting Off Funds to Assess Alaska Spill Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Exxon Corp. says it isn't happy with the
way the federal government is trying to assess the long-term
damages from last year's Alaska oil spill and doesn't plan to
contribute any more money for the effort.
   Officials of an inter-agency trustee council told a
congressional hearing Tuesday that efforts to determine the
evironmental damages caused by the massive spill from the tanker
Exxon Valdez cost $35.4 million in the first year, more than twice
the amount provided by Exxon.
   Damage assessment studies to be continued this year could cost
an additional $30 million, according to an internal trustee council
document made public by a House Interior and Insular Affairs
subcommittee.
   Shortly after the March 24, 1989 spill in Alaska's Prince
William Sound, Exxon agreed to provide $15 million an an initial
payment for the government damage assessment program. Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan at the time characterized the payment as
only a first installment from the oil company.
   But members of the trustee council told the subcommittee on
water, power and offshore energy resources Tuesday that Exxon has
stonewalled requests for additional money.
   ``The trustees have requested that Exxon fund the remaining $20
million (of 1989 costs), but so far Exxon has declined to respond
to that request,'' said Alan Raul, general counsel of the
Agriculture Department and a member of the trustee council.
   The minutes of a March meeting of the trustee council, released
by the subcommittee, quoted Justice Department officals as advising
the participants they ``should not expect further money from
Exxon.''
   The cost of damage assessment will be borne by the federal
government, although some of the money likely will be recovered as
part of the damages sought from Exxon in a civil suit that is yet
to be filed against the oil company.
   C.M. Harrison, executive vice president of Exxon Co., USA,
acknowledged that Exxon plans no further payments for damage
assessments.
   ``The process has not worked as Exxon anticipated,'' Harrison
said in a statement to the subcommittee. He complained Exxon was
not given access to data collected as part of the damage assessment
process and said there was too much ``emphasis on litigation.''
   Exxon so far has spent more than $1 billion in cleanup costs
from the spill, which contaminated miles of scenic Alaska
coastline. The Justice Department also is pursuing criminal charges
against Exxon that could lead to fines and penalties of more than
$600 million upon conviction.
   Meanwhile, several environment groups complained the damage
assessment process is inadequate and money shortages are causing
the trustees to curtail some studies essential to determining
overall harm to wildlife and natural resources.
   It was previously reported that the trustees decided in their
March meeting not to proceed with 24 of the 63 damage assessment
studies.
   ``The lawyers and not the scientists have driven the assessment
process,'' complained Erik Olson of the National Wildlife
Federation. He maintained some of the studies were halted because
they were too expensive and likely would not produce large payoffs
in damage recovery as a result of the eventual civil suit agaist
Exxon.
   ``Apparently, decisions on which studies to continue are based
at least in part on financial considerations,'' said Robert Adler,
a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Members of the trustee council are officials of the Agriculture
Department, Interior Department and the Commerce Department's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

   Police investigating a smuggling operation
stumbled across a factory in Brooklyn that was producing millions
of vials used to peddle crack.
   The factory in a one-story garage was discovered Monday when
police were looking for a gang member wanted for producing drug
paraphernalia, authorities said.
   Customs officials said the factory was the largest found in the
New York metropolitan area and probably was turning out 2 million
of the plastic, half-inch vials a day.
   ``Four or five times we've found machinery, but nothing close to
this scale,'' said Customs agent Victoria Ovis.
   Three people were arrested under a state law passed last summer
against producing drug paraphernalia. Customs officials also said
they seized three plastic molding machines and hundreds of
thousands of vials.
   The owner of the building was not identified, police said.
   Crack vials previously were imported from Southeast Asia and
labeled as perfume containers on shipping manifests.
   But since 1987, when a federal law outlawing imports of drug
paraphernalia went into effect, domestic production of the
containers has increased, The New York Times reported today.
   Making packages for illegal drugs is estimated to be a $1
billion-a-year industry.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Protest Removal of Head of Defense Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are criticizing the Defense
Department for removing the director of its high technology
research agency.
   Members of Congress said the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency is the only place in government where tax dollars are used
to promote cutting-edge technology that can help make U.S.
businesses more competitive overseas.
   The Pentagon said Craig Fields, who headed DARPA for a year, was
transferred rather than fired from the agency. But his supporters
in industry and in Congress contended Fields was removed last
Friday for emphasizing dual-use technology, which has civilian as
well as military applications.
   ``This is the triumph of ideology over the national interest,''
said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Gephardt referred to conservatives in the administration who
argue that government should refrain from investing in non-defense
research from which private industry would profit. They say the
free market should be allowed to work and that industry should
finance its own research.
   Gephardt was among 11 lawmakers of both parties who signed a
letter Tuesday urging the Defense Department to reinstate Fields to
his post at DARPA. He also asked the House Armed Services Committee
to investigate the situation.
   The research agency has a $1.2 billion budget, about half of
which goes to dual-use technologies, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.,
said at a news conference.
   DARPA-funded projects include super computers, artificial
intelligence, software, semiconductor manufacturing technology and
biotechnology. Levine, whose home state is a high-technology
center, is co-chairman of the Congressional High-Technology Caucus.
   Levine also chairs Rebuild America, a public-policy group that
promotes high-technology industries. He said he is drafting
legislation that would put DARPA under control of the Commerce
Department and require that funds be spent only on dual-use
technology except in special cases.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., who signed the letter, said he does not
want President Bush ``to go down in history as the president who
presided over the economic decline of the United States of America
because he and members of his administration were blind.''
   He was joined by Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., who is chairman of the
congressional Technology and Policy Task Force as well as ranking
member of the commerce and competitiveness subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Other signers of the protest letter were Reps. Les AuCoin,
D-Ore.; Norman Mineta, D-Calif.; Edward Markey, D-Mass.; Nicholas
Mavroules, D-Mass.; Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio; and Helen D. Bentley,
R-Md.; and Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Commerce subcommittee on science, technology and space.
   A Pentagon statement said Fields on May 6 would begin serving in
a new post that would make him responsible for ``evaluating and
recommending actions to streamline the large and complex research
and development laboratory infrastructure'' of the Defense
Department.
   It said Victor Reis, the deputy director of DARPA, has been
named acting director pending the appointment of a new director.

   When John Yervant was 8 years old, he says,
the Ottoman Empire _ the forerunner of modern-day Turkey _ ordered
all Armenian residents to leave the town of Erzerum.
   Yervant's family embarked on a harrowing journey, eating grass
to survive, stumbling across dismembered bodies, seeing babies
trampled by horses. His father, Yervant says, was tortured and
killed by the Turks.
   On Tuesday, Yervant, 83, knocked on the door of the Turkish
Embassy to deliver a petition demanding that Turkey admit to the
Armenians' claim that the Ottoman Empire committed genocide and
killed 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923.
   The embassy refused to open the door. ``We know very well what
they want and we don't deal with them,'' said press counselor Tacan
Ildem.
   Yervant was among several hundred Armenians who staged a protest
outside the embassy on the 75th anniversary of the start of the
Armenian deportations. Commemorative events also were being held in
Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco and New York, among other cities.
   Turkey says 300,000 Armenians died in the deportations but
rejects the accusation of genocide, saying Turks and Armenians
alike were the victims of a civil war, famine and epidemic. Turkey
says Armenians started the civil war, in collusion with Czarist
Russia, in order to secede from the waning Ottoman Empire.
   In a statement on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Robert Dole,
R-Kansas, said 1.5 million Armenians were killed ``as a result of
conscious, vicious policies of the Ottoman Empire.''
   Dole led a fight in February for a resolution commemorating
April 24 as Armenian genocide day, but the measure was defeated
under strong pressure from Turkey and its lobbyists in Washington.
   ``We ought to be ashamed,'' he said. ``One reason 6 million Jews
were slaughtered is because of Hitler's conviction that no one
remembered the Armenian genocide.''
   President Bush, whose administration also opposed the
resolution, issued a proclamation to the nearly 1 million American
Armenians, marking April 24 as ``a day of remembrance for the more
than a million Armenian people who were victims.'' Although he
deliberately refrained from using the word ``genocide,'' supporters
of Turkey were angered.
   Armenians, who trace their roots to the second millennium B.C.,
once commanded a mighty empire stretching from the Caspian Sea to
the Mediterranean.
   In modern times, Armenians enjoyed a two-year period of
independence in 1918 on territory that is now the Soviet Republic
of Armenia. Today, about 4 million live in the Soviet Union and
another 3 are scattered in Turkey, Lebanon, Iran, France and the
United States.
   Yervant's story had a happy ending. He was placed in an
orphanage, ran away to France and became a dancer with the Folies
Bergeres. He came on tour to the United States during the 1930s and
stayed.

<HEAD>Returning Hostages Must Handle Anger, Readjustment, Experts Say</HEAD>

   Once the euphoria fades from the homecoming of
long-term hostages such as Robert Polhill, they risk another
prison, built of depression, anger, anxiety and a host of other
mental problems.
   They may also face families that learned to live without them,
and a society that forces them to play heroes while blaming them
for their captivity.
   Still, such problems can be avoided or eased by proper mental
health care and the basic resilience many hostages show, experts
say.
   ``The remarkable thing isn't that they have problems when they
return to the environment, but that people do successfully return,
that they do reconstruct their lives,'' said Dr. Harry Holloway,
chairman of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
   In fact, David Jacobsen, who spent nearly 17 months as a captive
in Lebanon before gaining freedom in 1986, says the experience can
make a person more tolerant and understanding.
   ``You really come to grasp what are the real values of life,''
he said in a recent interview. ``You understand what it is as an
innocent person to make it through another day of hell.''
   Polhill, who rejoined his family this week after more than three
years in captivity in Lebanon, is at the U.S. Air Force Hospital in
Wiesbaden, West Germany.
   Col. Dr. Kenneth Koskinen, medical director of the hospital,
said the ex-hostage is ``intellectually very sharp, has a great
sense of humor and, considering his ordeal, has a reasonably
positive mental status.''
   That is encouraging, but University of Maryland psychiatrist Dr.
David McDuff cautioned Tuesday that recovery from being a hostage
is a long-term process that can take many years.
   Lingering problems can include anger and depression that began
during captivity, said former State Department chief psychologist
Samuel Karson, who oversaw evaluations at the Wiesbaden hospital of
Americans who had been hostages in Iran.
   Anger arises as a captive starts thinking, ``Why are they doing
this to me?''' Karson said. The anger toward captors is compounded
because a hostage is helpless to act on it, he said.
   ``You can't understand their language, they have full control
over you, and you're turned into a helpless child all over again.''
   A hostage can also be angry at the U.S. government for not
getting him out sooner, he said.
   Depression can begin from the separation from family and the
insecurity about one's future, he said. And it does not simply
disappear upon release, he said.
   ``I'm afraid people's internal systems don't work like a radio
or TV set (where you) just flick the switch, now it's off,'' he
said.
   Immediately after release, an ex-hostage may also dwell
harmfully on his actions during captivity, said McDuff, who has
participated in Army teams that recovered hostages and hijacking
victims.
   Hostages can become ``extremely self-critical'' as they review
their actions, feelings and thoughts, McDuff said. They might blame
themselves for not stopping beatings other hostages received, or
for thoughts about harming their captors, he said.
   Former captives often fail to see that ``the rules in the middle
of a period of captivity really have more to do with survival than
with anything else. It's not like the normal world.''
   A released hostage may also risk post-traumatic stress disorder,
which can include excessive dwelling on the hostage experience, a
withdrawing from contacts and activities that might trigger
recollections, and anxiety.
   Still other difficulties can spring from adjusting to the
private and public worlds to which a long-term hostage returns. His
children have grown years older, shaped by a culture that differs
markedly from the life he endured for years, Holloway noted. And he
must fit into a family that has built a life without him, Holloway
said.
   The hostage also faces the expectations and attitudes of
society. Hostages are pressured into the roles of heroes ``when
they're not feeling very heroic,'' Holloway said.
   Paradoxically, society may also blame them for being taken
hostage, McDuff said. ``In order to feel comfortable in this
world,'' he said, ``we have to believe and think that things like
this don't happen unless somebody does something that makes it
happen.''
   What can be done to help newly freed hostages cope with their
return?
   A key step, experts say, is to give them immediately a week or
so out of the public eye, much like the decompression period
deep-sea divers take to adjust to a normal atmosphere.
   During this time, hostages can become acquainted with their
families and the changes they missed. They can come to terms with
their thoughts and actions in captivity. They can vent and deal
with anger.
   ``Let them make the choices,'' Karson said. ``That's how they
realize that they really are free again.''

   Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee
trying to craft a 1991 budget face an uncertain path, while the
major hurdle to House passage of a similar package seems to be
dissolving.
   The Senate panel was meeting for the second day today to try to
write its version of a $1.2 trillion spending package. Tuesday's
opening session spotlighted the disarray on the panel.
   Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., was ready to let the committee
vote on several proposals and said he believed the panel would
ultimately approve about $40 billion in budget cuts.
   But some Democrats said they would offer plans of their own.
   Two of them _ Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Charles Robb,
D-Va. _ might not vote for Sasser's proposals, asserting that more
dramatic budget-cutting is needed.
   With Democrats holding a 13-10 majority on the panel _ and
Republicans expected to oppose any Democratic package _ the
prospects for approval seemed uncertain.
   GOP lawmakers said they were unhappy with the Democratic
alternatives, saying they would be meaningless unless the White
House and Congress could negotiate ways to pare the deficit.
Republicans also said the Democratic plans would fall short of
reducing the 1991 deficit to $64 billion, as the Gramm-Rudman law
requires.
   ``We're going to be $20 billion off,'' predicted Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee.
   Across the Capitol, conservative House Democrats, displeased
with the defense cuts their party's $1.24 trillion spending plan
would impose, seemed likely to vote for it anyway.
   Their support would probably assure approval of the measure in
the Democratic-dominated House, where debate was scheduled to begin
today.
   The conservatives reasoned that approving the measure would move
the process one step closer to negotiations with the
administration, which they believe are necessary.
   ``I sense a general leaning, reluctantly so, to support the
budget and move the process to the next step,'' said Rep. Charles
Stenholm of Texas, a leader of about 40 conservative Democrats.
``That's what I intend to do.''
   Like their Senate counterparts, House Republicans are nearly all
opposed to the Democratic budget. They say only bargaining between
President Bush and congressional leaders will produce a legitimate
spending blueprint for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   The House budget would set defense spending at $295 billion, $8
billion less than what Bush wants.

<HEAD>Restrictions on Funds Said Prolonging AIDS Epidemic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restrictions on the use of federal AIDS
prevention and education funds are prolonging the epidemic and
should be removed, the National Commission on AIDS says.
   The restrictions are preventing communities from targeting
effective messages on how the AIDS virus is spread and what people
can do to protect against it, such as using condoms and cleaning
intravenous needles, the panel said Tuesday.
   ``Our only weapon is education,'' said June Osborn, commission
chairwoman. ``To put some artificial limits on that is like
declaring you're only going to use a certain caliber of weapon ...
to fight a war.''
   The recommendation to remove these restrictions was one of five
made by the commission in its second report to President Bush.
   The panel also urged Bush to coordinate the federal government's
response to the epidemic, to support legislation to provide $600
million in federal funds to areas hit hard by the disease and to
pump federal dollars into housing for people with AIDS.
   In addition, commissioners sought House support for an
anti-discrimination bill that has been passed by the Senate and
endorsed by Bush.
   Because AIDS is transmitted chiefly through sexual intercourse
with an infected person and by sharing needles with an infected
IV-drug user, the content of government-funded messages about
spread of the disease has been a subject of sensitivity.
   An example of content-restrictions can be found in the Centers
for Disease Control's proposed revisions of regulations on
AIDS-related education materials produced with CDC funds.
   One provision requires that this material not contain ``terms,
descriptions or displays which will be offensive to a majority of
the intended audience or to a majority of persons outside the
intended audience.''
   Another provision of that regulation says federally funded
educational programs and materials ``shall not be designed to
promote or encourage, directly, intravenous drug abuse or sexual
activity, homosexual or heterosexual.''
   Commission member Diane Ahrens, who directed a working group on
government responsibilities and is a county commissioner in St.
Paul, Minn., said the restrictions make it difficult for
communities to target those most at risk of getting AIDS.
   ``There's a feeling that its inappropriate for Washington or
Atlanta (CDC headquarters) to tell folks in the South Bronx or
Boise (Idaho) how they should direct their educational programs,''
she said. ``What is appropriate for the South Bronx may not be
appropriate for Boise.
   ``We're talking about a deadly disease here,'' she said. ``You
have to talk about using bleach (to disinfect needles) if they are
abusing drugs ... you need to talk about use of condoms, and that
may not be acceptable to some communities, but you have to be
relevant to the community you're trying to reach.''
   In some cases, states and cities are imposing similar
restrictions on the use of their funds.
   ``The chilling effect sort of permeates the system,'' said
commission spokesman Tom Brandt.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Cutting Tariff on Caribbean-Made Tennis Shoes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate says it won't agree to cut the
tariff on tennis shoes manufactured in the Caribbean, after a
debate that featured several members waving various brands of shoes
in the air.
   On a 63-33 vote Tuesday night and despite the desires of the
Bush administration, the Senate rejected cutting in half the 48
percent to 67 percent tariffs on rubber-sole, canvas-top athletic
shoes produced in the Caribbean.
   To opponents, led by Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of
Maine, the issue was jobs _ not shoes capitalizing on the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles fad.
   ``This amendment will destroy an industry (and) ... cost
hundreds if not thousands of jobs in this country,'' said Mitchell,
citing 800 mostly elderly and women workers at New Balance and
Etonic athletic shoe plants in his state.
   The amendment by Sen. Bob Graham _ who held up a pair of $7.95
Ninja Turtle shoes _ was defeated after Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said its passage could kill a bill providing permanent
duty-free status for most imports from the Caribbean and Central
America.
   ``The U.S. industry is on its knees and it's not fair to make
matters worse,'' said Bentsen, who as chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee is one of the most powerful voices in Congress on
trade issues.
   The overall bill was approved later on a 92-0 vote after the
Senate agreed to a further amendment banning imports from Burma
over alleged human rights violations.
   It now goes to a conference committee with members of the House,
where similar legislation making the Caribbean Basin Initiative
permanent was approved last year.
   Graham and other supporters of his amendment argued it would
shift jobs in the tennis shoe industry to the Caribbean from China,
Korea, Taiwan and other Far East countries.
   ``The question is not about whether jobs will be lost in the
United States,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., ``The real debate
is whether we're going to move production from mainland China ... a
country that massacres its students ... to struggling democracies
in the Caribbean.''
   Packwood waved a pair of shoes that later were pointed out to be
Korean-made.
   Opponents, however, also waved various brands of tennis shoes
produced in their states and said the job-losers would be Americans
rather than Chinese and Koreans.
   They said 11,000 U.S. jobs have been lost since 1980, when half
of all shoes sold in this country were U.S.-made.
   Today, with only 8,000 Americans still employed in shoe
manufacturing, they said, imports now account for 82 percent of all
shoes sold in the country and 74 percent of the athletic shoes.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate approved several amendments,
including one by Packwood that would prohibit the export of logs
harvested on government-owned forest land.
   The bill extends indefinitely the duty-free access of Caribbean
goods, an authority that otherwise would expire in 1995. It also
continues a variety of temporary duty suspensions for various
chemicals and manufacturing components not produced domestically.
   In addition, the legislation lifts trade sanctions imposed in
1985 against Nicaragua, including the restoration of a sugar quota
worth up to $33 million this year.
   The 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative was intended to lift the
depressed economies of 24 Caribbean and Central American countries
through a combination of direct aid and an elimination of tariffs
and quotas to encourage new export industries in the region.
   Excluded from the duty-free program, however, were various
classifications of textiles, clothing, luggage, shoes, dinnerware,
leather products and other ``sensitive'' goods that compete
directly with U.S.-made products.

<HEAD>Poindexter Lawyers Seek to Overturn Guilty Verdict</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Poindexter's lawyers are urging acquittal
or a new trial for the former national security adviser, asserting
that Iran-Contra prosecutors failed to prove their case and used
the defendant's protected testimony to convict him.
   In post-trial motions, the lawyers said Tuesday that Poindexter
was victimized by statements he gave to Congress under a grant of
immunity from prosecution and that he therefore should be retried.
   Former White House aide Oliver North testified that he watched
as Poindexter tore up a presidential document ratifying a shipment
of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   At Poindexter's trial, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., blurted out a
reference to Poindexter destroying the document.
   ``The testimony of both witnesses was derived from Admiral
Poindexter's immunized testimony,'' the defense attorneys contended.
   The politically embarrassing document that Poindexter destroyed
portrayed the U.S. government as trading arms for hostages,
something then-President Reagan had said he would never do.
   No part of a criminal case may be based on a defendant's
statements given under a grant of immunity.
   Poindexter was convicted April 7 of conspiracy, two counts of
obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statements.
   A jury of eight women and four men found he had covered up from
Congress North's secret Contra resupply network and the U.S. role
in the November 1985 Hawk missile shipment.
   In urging U.S. District Judge Harold Greene to issue a judgment
of acquittal, Poindexter's lawyers said prosecutors:
   _Failed to prove there was a single conspiracy joining the
Contra and Iran portions of the case.
   _Didn't show that Poindexter knew there was an official
congressional inquiry into North's Contra activities.
   _Presented no evidence to show that Poindexter intended to
obstruct Congress when he deleted 5,000 computer messages.
   _Didn't explain how his alleged lies to Congress about the
missile shipment were material to the congressional inquiries.
   Poindexter's lawyers also said Greene made prejudicial comments
that warrant a new trial.
   As an example, they pointed to the judge's suggestion at one
point during North's testimony that there was evidence of a
conspiracy.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb also ``clearly prejudiced'' Poindexter by
suggesting in a ``highly inflammatory'' closing argument that
Reagan had lied to the American public about the Iran initiative,
said Poindexter's lawyers.
   Webb said ``you don't lie to the American public.'' The
prosecutor was referring to Reagan's statement on Nov. 13, 1986 in
a nationally televised address that the U.S. government didn't
trade arms for hostages.

<TEXT>
   Two AK-47 assault rifles stand in the
corner and Vladimir I. Lenin gazes down from a Cyrillic-captioned
photograph in the office of Jose Ortiz, who promises a strong civic
opposition from the Sandinistas.
   The city of Esteli, called ``the cradle of the revolution,''
remains a bastion, perhaps the last, of the outgoing leftists who
ousted the tyrannical Somoza family dynasty 11 years ago.
   Esteli's inhabitants are sad to see the revolution wane.
   ``The FSLN remains by far the strongest political party,'' says
the 49-year-old Ortiz, leader of the regional branch of the
Sandinista Worker's Federation.
   The former construction worker and guerrilla combatant used the
initials for the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which is
handing over the reins of government to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   ``None of those 14 little parties would have gotten even a pinky
finger into political power on their own,'' he said, refering to
the broad alliance that propelled Mrs. Chamorro to the presidency.
   He commented in his office on the main square of this
north-central city of 31,000 residents, the only metropolis of
considerable size won by the Sandinistas in the Feb. 25 elections.
   Nationwide, the presidential, legislative and municipal ballot
was a landslide for the United National Opposition coalition (UNO).
   Many of the pastel-painted buildings along Esteli streets are
still pocked with bullet holes from fierce combat during the
revolution that brought the Sandinistas to power. Part of downtown
was demolished by bombs and rockets delivered by President
Anastasio Somoza's warplanes.
   Some walls are patched. Others wear colorful murals of militia
men and women brandishing arms, Sandinista doctors administering
vaccines, young militants teaching peasants to read.
   It was a social experiment hailed throughout the hemisphere.
   ``Maybe because we in this city suffered more than anyone we've
been the ones to more completely understand what the revolution
meant,'' said Rafael Chavarria, an accountant waiting for a bus on
the sidewalk along the lovely central plaza.
   Chavarria, the son of peasant farmers, identified closely with
the Sandinistas but is not a party militant.
   ``It's clear that since the revolution more poor people have
been able to overcome their circumstances and make for themselves a
better life than their parents' life,'' he said.
   ``Now our role must be one of constructive criticism, to call
the new government's attention to what goes wrong. But always by
civic means,'' he said, eschewing any recourse to violence.
   Indeed, after the nearly decade-long insurgency of the
U.S.-funded Contra rebels, what he and Ortiz and most Nicaraguans
appear to most fervently desire from the transition is peace.
   ``People did not vote for either conservatives or communists or
any of the parties in UNO. Nor did they vote against the
Sandinistas,'' contended Ortiz. ``What they voted for was peace,
because they believed that if the Sandinistas won, the Contra war
imposed by the United States would continue.
   ``Most of the comrades (Sandinistas) understand this transition.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be handing over power peacefully. We're not
radicals,'' he said.
   ``The Sandinista movement was not born July 19, 1979 (the date
of the revolutionary victory). We have decades of experience of
political struggle. Now our job is to present opposition, a strong
opposition. We're going to defend what we've achieved.''
   He and Chavarria agreed that three things threaten Nicaragua:
renewed and escalated civil strife; failure of an estimated 9,000
Contra rebels to demobilize by June 10, as they have promised, and
revanchist anti-Sandinista measures by the new government.
   Mrs. Chamorro has insisted that her principal objective is
reconciliation.
   ``If the idea is to wipe the slate clean and start anew, then we
can achieve peace,'' said Chavarria. ``But if they start with `You
did this to me, so I'm doing this to you,' ...'' he shook his head
as his voice trailed off.
   Asked why he had the Soviet-made assault rifle in his office,
Ortiz defended the concept of a militia.
   ``All the weapons belong in the hands of the people,'' he said.
``I'm not going to use that gun in any aggressive way, but if any
SOB Contra comes after me, I'm ready to blow him away.''

   A man who committed suicide shortly after a
bomb he built maimed a 5-year-old girl at a K mart a year ago may
have taken his life because ``a good little girl was the victim,''
his stepfather says.
   David L. Swinford, 19, shot himself in the head in a car on a
rural road on April 19, 1989, two days after the bombing and hours
after having discussed the blast with his mother and sister,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Swinford, of rural Noblesville, was identified as a possible
suspect within days of the bombing, but investigators only recently
developed conclusive evidence he built the device, said Charles
Petersen, agent in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms in Indianapolis.
   Tests on a screwdriver and knife from Swinford's car determined
they were used in making the pipe bomb, which was concealed in a
pump-type toothpaste dispenser and blew the girl's hand off as she
lifted it from a shelf, Petersen said.
   Petersen said authorities knew of no motive for the bombing.
   But Swinford's stepfather, David W. Whitesell, recalled a
conversation his family had while watching a TV account of the
bombing a few hours after the incident.
   During the discussion, Whitesell said, his wife, Grace, wondered
aloud who would commit such a crime involving a child.
   ``David replied, `What business did a little girl have to do in
the trash bag department?''' Whitesell recalled. ``If he really did
do this, I think it was a real blow to him to find out that a good
little girl was the victim.''
   Erin Bower, now 6, now wears an artificial limb to replace the
left hand she lost in the blast. She was scheduled this month for a
cornea transplant in her left eye, also damaged in the explosion.
   Her mother, Maureen Bower, expressed sympathy over Swinford's
death.
   ``I'm sorry the boy felt he had to take his life over it.
Somehow I think that as well as Erin has done, we could have found
forgiveness for him,'' Mrs. Bower told WTHR-TV Tuesday night.
   While Swinford was withdrawn around adults and was asked to move
out of the home following disagreements, his mother and stepfather
said he loved children.
   Mrs. Whitesell said her son would play with the couple's
children _ Paula, 4{, and 15-month-old twins, Brittany and Paul.
   ``There was a point that I suggested he go into something where
he could work with disabled children because our boy has Down's
syndrome and David always related well with him,'' Mrs. Whitesell
said.
   Whitesell said his stepson never confessed to the bombing.
   Petersen said there was no evidence Swinford actually placed the
bomb on the shelf, and he may have had an accomplice.
   Swinford knew about bomb-making and electrical wiring from
building crude firecracker devices with friends and from working
with his stepfather in electronic installation, Petersen said.
   Despite the evidence announced Tuesday, Whitesell said his
family was uncertain whether to believe his stepson had a role in
the bombing.
   ``Sometimes I feel like it's easy to pick on the dead suspect,''
Whitesell said. ``On the other hand, the only way to be sure is for
David to come and tell me himself and he can't do that.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Reopens Investigation of Letelier Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has ordered a military
court to immediately reopen the investigation into the 1976
car-bomb assasination in Washington of former Foreign Minister
Orlando Letelier and an American aide.
   The court's unanimous decision Tuesday follows the recent
disclosure of the identity of a women who allegedly was involved in
the murder plot.
   The woman, Luisa Lagos, was quoted by a local newspaper as
saying she is a former agent of Chilean secret police, known as
DINA, and that she traveled to the United States in 1976 under the
assumed name of Liliana Walker.
   The Supreme Court ordered the military court that handled the
case before it was closed to question the woman, who has been under
police protection at an undisclosed location since going public
last week.
   The woman said she went to the United States with a DINA agent
who prepared the Letelier killing.
   Letelier and an American aide, Ronni Moffit, were killed Sept.
21, 1976, when his car was destroyed by a bomb in downtown
Washington.
   Letelier was a prominent foe of the Chilean military regime of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The new civilian government of President
Patricio Aylwin, who succeeded Pinochet on March 11, has promised
``full cooperation with the courts'' in the case.
   The lower house of Congress on Tuesday unanimously approved a
goverment-proposed bill for the posthumous restoration of
Letelier's citizenship.
   The Pinochet regime had stripped him of citizenship two weeks
before his death, accusing him of ``actions against the interests
of the Chilean nation.''
   Three Chilean army officers, members of the Pinochet regime's
secret police, were indicted in the case by a court in Washington,
but the Chilean Supreme Court turned down a request for their
extraditions in 1979.
   One of the officers, Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios, slipped out
of the country in 1987 and surrendered to U.S. courts, where he
admitted to a collaborative role in the plot to kill Letelier.
   Fernandez is now living in the United States under a new
identity after serving a seven-month sentence. The others, retired
Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who was the director of DINA, and
his top aide, retired Col. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, are still in Chile.
   The United States goverment, which repeatedly complained of what
it called lack of cooperation by the Pinochet regime in
investigating the assasination, has insisted that Contreras and
Espinoza be tried, either in Chile or in the United States.
   Contreras and Espinoza have said they were not involved in the
case.
   Another DINA agent, Michel Townley, an American, was convicted
in the case in the United States and is now living there under a
new identity after serving a jail sentence.
   Two weeks ago, another alleged participant in the plot, Dionisio
Suarez, was arrested by the FBI in Florida. Suarez, an anti-Castro
Cuban, faces trial in Washington.
   The U.S. ambassador, Charles Gillespie, discussed the Letelier
case Tuesday with Interior Minister Enrique Krauss. After the
hourlong meeting, Gillespie said he sees ``a strong will in the new
goverment to investigate the case.''
   Letelier's sister, Fabiola Letelier, a lawyer, called the
court's decision Tuesday ``a positive step.'' However, she said,
the family still wants the case transferred from the military court
to a civilian court.

<HEAD>Polish Leader Urges Lithuania to Compromise on Timing, Not Goal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania should be patient about gaining
independence from the Soviet Union without compromising on its
ultimate goal, advises a leader of Solidarity, the movement that
brought democracy to Poland.
   Bronislaw Geremek, political adviser to Solidarity founder Lech
Walesa and the movement's parliamentary leader, urged Western
governments to recognize both sides of the tense conflict between
Lithuania and the Kremlin.
   ``First, that the Lithuanians are right fighting for their
freedom and national independence and second, one should seek (to
find) in what way the Soviet Union can accept and cope with this
new situation,'' he said Tuesday in a speech at the National Press
Club.
   Geremek said he admires the Lithuanian independence leaders but
added, ``until now they have no experience of compromise, political
dialogue and political deal, and they have to learn it as we have
learned it within a few months, and I hope that our friends in
Lithuania will go the same way.
   ``It means that one cannot have a compromise concerning values
and aspirations, but one can have a compromise concerning the
time,'' he added. The forum was sponsored by the Atlantic Council
and the German Marshall Fund _ U.S. and West German organizations
supporting foreign policy research and international exchange.
   The Lithuanian conflict confirms the words of Andrei Sakharov,
longtime Soviet dissident, a few months before his death last year
that ``the very future of the Soviet Union depends on its changing
its structure,'' Geremek said.
   He added that he hopes the Soviet Union realizes this, and that
the United States and other Western governments understand both
sides of the problem.
   The visiting Solidarity leader, a historian twice jailed for
dissident activity under the fallen communist government, was
elected to Parliament last year representing Suwalki, a region on
the Polish-Lithuanian border.
   Democracy in the Central European countries is still very weak,
he said, and while communism has no chance for a comeback, ``real
danger of a new authoritarian system exists in all Central European
countries'' if economic reforms fail.
   The drastic austerity of Poland's economic reforms is being
watched closely by Hungary, Czechoslovakia and other Central
European countries as well as the Soviet Union itself and
ultimately they might require similar measures, he said.
   Countries have moved from dictatorship to democracy, but
Poland's efforts to ``return from totalitarian economy to market
economy never happened in history,'' he said. ``The results of this
first experiment will have its importance for other countries in
the same situation.''
   After 1,000 percent inflation last year, Poland began 1990 with
price increases, monetary and other reforms, and inflation dropped
from 80 percent in January to 5 percent in March, Geremek said.
   The ``social cost'' has been high, he said, with ``dangerous
recession'' trends including a 30 percent drop in industrial
production and unemployment soaring from under 50,000 to 300,000
with promise of much bigger rises by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   Miners in the small Outback town of
Coober Pedy claimed today to have found the world's biggest opal,
an uncut rock that weighs 11.6 pounds and is worth an estimated $3
million.
   Named ``Jupiter 5,'' the stone is a milky-white opal that the
miners said was unearthed last July. They did not explain why its
discovery was not announced earlier. The miners said the stone is
9.2 inches long and 4.8 inches wide, with a total of 26,350 carats.
   A mine spokesman said the gem was found 56 feet underground in
Coober Pedy, a town in New South Wales state known for its
underground homes and motels. Residents dig dwellings into the
earth to protect against intense summer heat.
   The miners also showed pictures today of a polished opal dubbed
``Unnamed Lady'' that they said was about half the size of Jupiter
5 and worth about $1 million.

<HEAD>Anti-Billboard Legislation Introduced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarter century after Congress sought to
beautify the nation's highways, billboards still blight the
landscape, a coalition of public officials and environmentalists
say.
   Giant billboards on metal posts as much as 150 feet tall have
replaced the 15-foot plywood signs that dotted highways in the
mid-1960s. And according to a group proposing a ban on new
billboards along federal highways, advertisers have used loopholes
and amendments in the 1965 highway beautification law to cut down
public trees and spend taxpayer dollars to take down old signs.
   ``The Highway Beautification Act of 1965, despite its good
intentions, has not lived up to its expectations,'' Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., author of the billboard proposal, told the Senate
Tuesday.
   The answer proposed by Chafee, several Senate and House
colleagues, Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire and several environmental
groups is to take power away from the federal government.
   The legislation, in addition to banning new billboards on major
federal highways, would allow states, cities and towns to remove
existing billboards along those roadways. Using a court-tested
amortization process, the communities could remove the signs in as
little as five years at no cost to taxpayers, according to Chafee.

<HEAD>Cuba Extends Jamming of Radio Marti Past Sunrise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba is now jamming the U.S. government's
Radio Marti broadcasts in the morning hours, says a spokeswoman for
the Voice of America, which runs the station.
   VOA spokeswoman Beth Knisley said Tuesday that the agency
deplores the action taken against Radio Marti, which began
broadcasting five years ago. The jamming denies the Cuban people
``access to uncensored news and information,'' she said.
   She quoted a Cuban government statement as saying that the
jamming was a ``new step toward a definitive solution of the
problem.'' She said the broadcast operation can still be heard on
shortwave radios.
   Cuba started jamming the station during the pre-dawn hours last
week and then shifted the interference on Tuesday to the
post-sunrise period when the audience is much greater.
   The actions appear to be related to the advent of TV Marti, the
televised version of Radio Marti. TV Marti tests began last month
during the early morning hours and have been jammed consistently by
Cuban transmitters.

<HEAD>Agency Rejects Proposal to Tax Children's Social Security Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration will not
collect income taxes on many Social Security benefits paid to
children claimed as dependents by their parents.
   The agency rejected the proposal, made by the inspector general
of the Health and Human Services Department, as ``anti-family'' and
contrary to President Bush's goal of a ``kindler, gentler America.''
   Inspector General Richard Kusserow recommended, in an audit
released Tuesday, that the taxes be paid by most of the 334,000
middle- and upper-income families whose children how receive
tax-free benefits.
   Even as the children were receiving the tax-free benefits, about
4.5 million retirees and disabled beneficiaries and their spouses
at the same income levels were paying income taxes on as much as
one-half of their Social Security benefits.
   In a memo included in the report, Social Security Commissioner
Gwendolyn King rejected the proposal, saying she was concerned
about how it would be perceived by Congress and the public.

   Her four children from three

   ``It's the most sick she's been under my care,'' Dr. Michael

   The 58-year-old actress has been hospitalized more than two

   Miss Taylor was receiving medication intravenously, her
breathing is aided by a ventilator and ``her spirits are good,''
Roth said.
   Among those maintaining a vigil at her bedside were her
children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and
Michael Wilding.
   On Sunday, she underwent surgery to remove a piece of lung
tissue to determine the cause of her pneumonia, doctors said.
Results of the biopsy were expected Thursday.
   Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9
with what doctors said was a persistent fever and sinus infection.
When her condition worsened, she was moved April 16 to St. Johns.
   In a statement after arriving at St. Johns, she denied rumors
she had AIDS.
   Miss Taylor, the winner of best-actress Oscars for ``Butterfield
8'' and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' has been plagued with
health problems for years, particularly back troubles from filming
of ``National Velvet'' in 1945, when she fell off a horse.
   She had a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961.
   In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and painkillers. Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug
abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic, and her weight over the years has
been up and down.

<HEAD>Has `Twin Peaks' Peaked in the Ratings?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NBC comedy ``Wings'' landed in the top 10
in the ratings in its debut, while ABC's much ballyhooed ``Twin
Peaks'' appears to have done just that _ peaked, that is.
   Film director David Lynch's nighttime soap opera chronicling
sex, violence and junk food in a small Northwest lumber town
continues to lose viewers, according to figures released Tuesday by
the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   After a debut two weeks ago at No. 5, ``Twin Peaks'' plummeted
to 28th in the week ended April 22. Debuting against it on
Thursday, ``Wings'' was the No. 7 show on television.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was the top-rated program for the week. And all
the hype in Hollywood failed to attract a major audience for
Sunday's Earth Day special on ABC. ``Time Warner Presents the Earth
Day Special'' won its time slot, but the celebrity extravaganza
finished overall in a three-way tie for 16th place, with an average
rating of 14.6.
   The peacock still struts as the No. 1 network with an average
rating of 12.5 for NBC. ABC was second with a 12;, CBS had a 9.6.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 households.
   If the humor of ``Wings'' sounded like the banter of the
``Cheers'' bar patrons, it's because three former ``Cheers''
writers wrote the pilot for ``Wings,'' which follows the adventures
of two brothers running a commuter airline on Nantucket Island in
Massachusetts.
   ``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue'' helped make TV history. The
anti-drug simulcast of Bugs Bunny, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
and Donald Duck's nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie drew the largest
audience ever for a Saturday morning entertainment program.
   Broadcast by ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, the ``just say no'' kiddie
show netted a 22 average.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
   ``Cheers,'' NBC, 21.9; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC,
21.7; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 21.1; ``America's Funniest Home
Videos'' special repeat, ABC, 20.9; ``A Different World,'' NBC,
20.8; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 19.8; ``Wings,'' NBC, 19; ``The Wonder
Years,'' ABC, 18.4; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 16.8, and ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, 16.8.
   In the network news battle, Peter Jennings and ``World News
Tonight'' on ABC were No. 1 for the 15th consecutive week with a 10
average. In second place was ``The CBS Evening News,'' with Dan
Rather at 8.8. ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw had an 8.3.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index recovered from
early losses and closed slightly higher Wednesday, while the dollar
rose sharply against the yen.
   The dollar closed at 159.25 yen, up 1.10 yen from Tuesday's
close of 158.15 yen. It opened at 158.96 yen and ranged between
158.80 yen and 159.28 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average climbed 62.98 points, or 0.21
percent, closing at 29,564.36. It gained more than 200 points in
early trading but was down 42.15 points at the end of morning
trading before bouncing back in the afternoon.
   Traders said buying interest was spurred in the afternoon by the
announcement of a land development plan by Mitsubishi Mining and
Smelting Co.
   The Nikkei's fall in the morning session was largely due to a
decline in futures prices discouraging market players, they said.
   Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co., said many investors were reluctant to buy ahead of
the Golden Week holidays that start Saturday and continue through
May 6 for many Japanese companies.
   ``They are trying to stay on the safer side, especially due to
uncertainties over foreign exchange fluctuations,'' he said.
   The dollar's strength reflected its gains in overseas markets.
The dollar finished at 158.95 yen in New York overnight, up from
157.55 yen on Monday.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said
the dollar gained ground in thin trading focused on cross trading
between the yen and the West German mark. Trading was light because
the Sydney market was closed because of a national holiday in
Australia, he said.
   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 No. 10
Japanese government bonds slipped to 85.80 from Tuesday's close of
85.82. That pushed the yield up slightly to 7.41 percent from 7.405
percent.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following is a chronology of
important events since the leftist Sandinistas came to power nearly
11 years ago in Nicaragua:
   _July 19, 1979: The Sandinista National Liberation Front enters
the capital Managua two days after longtime dictator Anastasio
Somoza flees the country.
   _November 1980: First attacks by anti-Sandinistas who become
known as the Contras, short for the Spanish word for
counterrevolutionary.
   _February 1981: Reagan administration suspends U.S. aid.
   _November 1982: First reports emerge of covert U.S. aid to the
Contras.
   _May 1, 1985: Reagan announces trade embargo against Nicaragua.
   _Aug. 13, 1986: The U.S. Senate approves $100 million military
aid package passed earlier by the House.
   _Nov. 25, 1986: U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese says some
profits from the sale of American arms to Iran were secretly
diverted to the Contras in an operation under Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North.
   _Aug. 7, 1987: Five Central American presidents sign a regional
peace plan.
   _Feb. 3, 1988: Congress cuts off military aid to the Contras.
Non-lethal aid continues.
   _April 1, 1988: A formal 60-day truce begins following first
direct meeting between Sandinistas and Contras.
   _May 31, 1988: The Sandinistas decide to extend the cease-fire
on a month-to-month basis; the Contras say they consider the truce
indefinite. Fighting slackens.
   _Feb. 14, 1989: Five Central American presidents agree the
Contras should be demobilized. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
agrees to hold free and fair elections in 1990.
   _April 28: President Bush signs a $49 million non-lethal aid
package for the Contras that will run out three days after the 1990
elections.
   _Aug. 7: The Central American presidents formalize the
demobilization accord.
   _Aug. 26: Contra commander Israel Galeano says the rebels will
ignore the demobilization agreement and starts moving his troops
back to Nicaragua.
   _Nov. 1: Ortega lifts the 19-month-old cease-fire after several
attacks and the infiltration of thousands of Contra troops.
Fighting surges briefly.
   _Feb. 25: Elections monitored by thousands of international
observers are held. Ortega suffers a stunning upset at the hands of
a nation weary of war and financial ruin, the latter caused in part
by U.S. economic embargo.
   _Feb. 27: The Sandinistas say the Contras have to demobilize
before they will hand over control of the police and armed forces.
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro calls on the Contras to
disband, saying the elections mean there is no reason to keep
fighting.
   _March 13: President Bush lifts the economic embargo and asks
Congress for $300 million in aid, including $45 million to
demobilize and relocate the Contras.
   _March 27: Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the United National
Opposition, and the Sandinistas sign an agreement on transition
that calls for depoliticizing the Sandinista army.
   _April 19: Sandinistas, Contras and the coalition agree on a
cease-fire and the immediate concentration of the Contras in
security zones. The Contras agree to begin surrendering their
weapons on April 25, inauguration day, and to disband by June 10.

<HEAD>Newspapers Succeed With Market Knowledge and Staff Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the face of declining readership, some
newspapers are succeeding by remaining close to their subscribers
and by building loyal reporting staffs with authoritative knowledge
of the communities they cover.
   In a report submitted Tuesday at the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, a research group dubbed ``The A-Team'' told
what made three newspapers more successful than most.
   Group members said they found different formulas at The Free
Lance-Star of Fredericksburg, Va., The Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette
and The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif.
   But one trait was universal. ``They knew their markets cold and
were always updating their understanding,'' said Michelle Foster,
marketing director of the News-Press of Fort Myers, Fla., and a
member of the research group.
   Seymour Topping, director of editorial development for the New
York Times Regional Newspaper Group, said a team approach to
running the newspapers helped. He added that each gave its readers
a complete paper with local, national and international news.
   Harold F. Woldt Jr., vice president-circulation of Newsday, of
Long Island, N.Y., pointed to a loyal staff as a key to success at
all three papers. He stressed that only if core personnel are
retained can they know the communities they serve.
   He said the three papers had unusual stability among their
staff, accomplished through publisher involvement, better pay and a
sense of institutional commitment to the newspaper.
   The presentation was chaired by William J. Keating, chairman and
publisher of The Cincinnati Enquirer, who declared the report gave
him ``renewed faith that we, the newspaper people of America, can
meet the challenge.''
   In other events Tuesday at the association's 104th annual
convention, the nation's newspaper publishers discussed declining
readership, telecommunications developments affecting papers and
recycling of newsprint.
   To build greater reader interest, an advertising consultant
advised newspapers to focus on local news, suggesting international
issues don't sell advertising.
   The comments came during a panel discussion titled ``Ozzie and
Harriet Are Gone _ Who Do You Think You're Writing For?'' The
discussion was moderated by Jeff Greenfield of ABC News.
   Virginia Dodge Fielder, vice president of research for
Knight-Ridder Inc., expressed industry frustration over vanishing
readers.
   ``I wish they expressed more dissatisfaction because if they did
we'd know how to tackle it,'' she said. ``What the public is saying
is not `I hate you,' but `I don't need you.'''
   The session opened with video interviews in which subjects were
asked if they read a newspaper.
   ``I don't have time,'' was a common response. Several said TV
news was ``easier.'' One man said that since big business had taken
over his local paper, he felt less connected to it. The comment
echoed a message emphasized by Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of
FCB-Leber Katz partners and vice president of consumer affairs for
the Chrysler Corp.
   ``The only specialized thing about a newspaper is its
locality,'' she told the audience. ``Localness is what you have to
sell.''
   But Frank A. Daniels Jr., president and publisher of The News &amp;
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., interjected that ``a newspaper
traditionally has been a smorgasbord.''
   Ms. Cutler warned against newspapers trying to be ``all things
to all people.''
   Greenfield suggested that the puzzle of declining readership may
not be complex. ``Is it possible that the reason people read
newspapers so devotedly in 1940 is there was nothing else to inform
them?'' he asked.
   Publishers and editors on the panel disagreed.
   ``One thing you may be overlooking is how adaptable newspapers
are,'' said C. Shelby Coffey III, editor and executive vice
president of the Los Angeles Times.
   He noted the Times has numerous regional bureaus to keep the
paper local but has inaugurated a ``World Report'' section on
global developments. ``Research at the Times shows that
international news is of great interest to readers,'' he said.
   Coffey and Gerald Garcia, editor and publisher of The Knoxville
(Tenn.) Journal, also urged development of a multi-ethnic reporting
force.
   Publishers were also told they must move to recycle newsprint to
stave off government interference.
   Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive officer of
the Hearst Corp. in New York and chairman of the ANPA Newsprint
Resource Task Force, painted a grim picture of vanishing landfills.
   He said publishers have resolved to double the amount of
recycled newsprint used in the coming year, reaching a total of 4.6
million tons.
   ``We believe efforts to control newsprint can mean efforts to
control the press,'' he said. ``The prospect of dealing with a
regulated newsprint industry calls up an array of terrifying
unknowns.''
   He said 35 percent of newspapers are recycled, and publishers
aim to bring that up to 50 percent.
   Bennack said that in 1979 the nation had 18,000 landfills
available. Today only 6,500 remain, he said, and by 1995 that
figure will diminish to 4,200.
   Bennack stressed that newsprint makes up only 8 percent of solid
waste in landfills.
   In a separate development, publishers were told they may be
close to winning a six-year dispute with the Bell
telecommunications companies.
   Robert M. Johnson, publisher, president and chief executive
officer of Newsday Inc. of Long Island, N.Y., reported that
Congress is likely to pass a bill soon setting a telecommunications
public policy.
   Citing antitrust laws, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene held
that those who control telecommunication lines should not also
control the information that goes over those lines, Johnson said.
   He recounted that Bell companies lobbied for exceptions to the
1984 court ruling on the breakup of AT&amp;T.
   Johnson said the Bell companies have set aside a $25 million
``war chest'' to fight to publish information on electronic
circuits. He said Bell seeks to launch an ``electronic Yellow
Pages'' in competition with newspaper ads.
   An ANPA task force has worked with Congress, Johnson said.
   ``The result of those long negotiations was a new draft bill,''
he said. ``It is from our point of view the best piece of
legislation we've seen.''
   The bill has not yet been passed. An appeal of the original
federal order has sent that back to Greene for reconsideration.

   Here are some facts and figures on
Nicaragua, where Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is to be inaugurated
as president today:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America,
about the size of Iowa, with 57,000 square miles.
   A coastal plain rolls from the Pacific Coast to the central
mountains, providing the country with rich farmland. Farms and
ranches dot the mountains. The eastern half of the country is
sparsely populated, crisscrossed by rivers and dominated by the
steamy jungles of the Miskito coast along the Caribbean.
   No road connects the two coasts.
   A string of more than 50 volcanos runs northwest to southeast
near the Pacific coast. One of Nicaragua's two large lakes contains
the world's only freshwater sharks.
   A Dec. 23, 1972, earthquake and fires destroyed the center of
Managua. Much of the capital has not been rebuilt and remains a
wasteland of weedy lots and skeletons of buildings.
   Nicaragua is bordered by Honduras on the north, Costa Rica on
the south.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Nicaragua has 3.5 million people, about 90 percent
living in the western half of the country and about half under age
16.
   Managua, the most populous city, has 850,000 residents.
   Spanish is the official language. English and native Indian
languages, mostly Miskito, are spoken by ethnic minorities along
the Caribbean coast.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Exports of coffee, cotton, sesame and beef provide
most of Nicaragua's income. From $700 million in 1978, the year
before the Sandinistas came to power, exports dropped to $200
million in 1989, at the height of the U.S. trade embargo.
   Inflation for 1989 was 1,700 percent, according to the
government, a figure that many experts think is low. In 1988,
prices rose 33,600 percent. The currency, the cordoba, has been
steadily devalued in line with inflation.
   President Bush lifted the 1985 U.S. embargo on March 13 and
asked Congress for $300 million in aid, including $45 million to
demobilize and relocate the Contras.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Spain conquered Nicaragua's various Indian tribes in
1552. The country won independence from Spain in 1821.
   Relations with the United States have long been traumatic.
   In the 1850s, American adventurer William Walker invaded the
country several times, once declaring himself president.
   Early in the 1900s, U.S. Marines occupied the country, leaving
for the last time in 1933. Augusto Cesar Sandino became a national
hero fighting the Americans. He was killed in 1934 and the United
States installed Gen. Anastasio Somoza, founder of a 42-year Somoza
family dynasty.
   The last Somoza, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, was overthrown July
19, 1979, in a revolution led by the Sandinista National Liberation
Front, named after Sandino.
   Discontent after nine years of war and increasing economic
deterioration helped Mrs. Chamorro oust Sandinista President Daniel
Ortega in a Feb. 25 vote. Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, a Somoza opponent whose assassination in January
1978 consolidated support for the Sandinista revolt.

   Donald and Ivana Trump, though not your average
flower children, are taking a turn at free love.
   New York's most-trumpeted couple have signed a two-page
agreement allowing them to date third and fourth parties without
such action giving either grounds for divorce, the Daily News and
the New York Post reported today.
   ``Trump: The Dating Game'' is good for at least 60 days, at
which point either side may cancel the pact, the papers said.
   The Post and the News quoted sources as saying the pact was
drawn up at the request of Mrs. Trump, who yearns to date but
doesn't want to diminish any divorce settlement.
   ``She is basically saying, `I don't want a divorce, and I don't
want to become a nun,''' one source told the Post.
   Stanley Lotwin, one of Trump's lawyers, confirmed the agreement
in a statement.
   ``We're confirming that a very limited agreement was signed,
having to do with each being permitted to conduct themselves as if
they were single, but having nothing to do with finance,'' he said
in the Daily News.

   A freshly poured concrete support arch on a
bridge connecting Minneapolis and St. Paul fell into the
Mississippi River, killing a construction worker.
   Several employees of C.S. McCrossan Construction Inc. were
inspecting the arch when a 200-foot piece gave way Tuesday,
dropping more than 100 tons of concrete and debris, authorities
said.
   Robert A. Moser, 45, suffered multiple injuries and may have
died before he hit the water 90 feet below, said Gary Kaldun, an
investigator with the Hennepin County medical examiner's office.
   At least one other worker plunged into the water but was not
seriously hurt, police said.
   ``They said a sag or a bulge in the form was noted and they were
up there inspecting that when it all gave way,'' Kaldun said.
   The $15.7 million bridge was being built to replace an adjacent
span about 100 years old. The two bridges are less than 20 feet
apart.
   State Transportation Commissioner Leonard Levine said the cause
of the collapse was not known.
   He said state engineers would also inspect the old bridge today
to determine if it was weakened by the impact of the collapse. The
old bridge was closed to traffic.
   ``It was just like a plane would crash. It even felt like the
ground shook a bit,'' said Clarence Stodolka, who was walking near
the Minneapolis end of the bridge.

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index recovered from
early losses and closed slightly higher.
   The dollar closed at 159.25 yen, up 1.10 yen from Tuesday's
close of 158.15 yen. It opened at 158.96 yen following overnight
gains in New York and ranged between 158.80 yen and 159.28 yen.
   The dollar climbed in Tokyo trading as market players bought the
West German mark against the yen, said Akiko Baba, a Bank of Tokyo
dealer.
   ``Dollar buying by trading houses also helped strengthen the
dollar,'' she added.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said trading was thin ahead of the Golden Week holidays, which
start Saturday and go through May 6 for many Japanese companies.
   Some $8.68 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average climbed
62.98 points, or 0.21 percent, closing at 29,564.36. It gained more
than 200 points in early trading, was down 42.15 points at the end
of the morning session and then bounced back in the afternoon.
   Traders said buying interest was spurred in the afternoon by the
announcement of a land development plan by Mitsubishi Mining and
Smelting Co.
   Japan Airlines Co. was also the focus of attention after
announcing a 10-for-1 stock split Tuesday that will bring down the
stock's par value from $3.14 to 31 cents. Trading in JAL shares was
halted when the price reached $106, a gain of $12.60 _ the maximum
gain allowed in one day, said Masashi Wakabayashi, a trader with
Yamaichi Securities Co.
   The split takes effect Aug. 8.
   ``Recently, market players are targeting individual issues with
good performances,'' he said. ``Even when the index is falling,
market players are no longer selling actively.''
   The Nikkei's morning decline was largely due to a decline in
futures prices discouraging market players, said Haruhito Ichimura,
a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co.
   He said many investors were reluctant to buy ahead of the
``Golden Week'' holidays.
   They are trying to stay on the safer side, especially due to
uncertainties over foreign exchange fluctuations, he said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No.119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was quoted at 85.88 points as of 4 p.m.,
up slightly from Tuesday's close of 85.82. Their yield was down to
7.395 percent from 7.405 percent the previous day.

<TEXT>
   A former hot-dogging prosecutor pleaded
guilty to falsely claiming armed drug dealers in a speeding car had
tried to assassinate him.
   Samuel Asbell was barred Tuesday from ever holding public office
again and agreed to pay $12,000 to cover the cost of investigating
his tale. He faces up to 18 months in prison or a $7,500 fine.
   No sentencing date was set for the former Camden County
prosecutor, who used to accompany detectives on drug raids, toted a
gun in a shoulder holster and wore a bushy walrus-style moustache.
   In pleading guilty to providing false information to police,
Asbell told Superior Court Judge Samuel Lenox that he sought
counseling and now knows why he concocted the story. He did not
elaborate. After court, he refused comment.
   Asbell in January had claimed at a news conference that he
narrowly escaped death at the hands of two drug dealers who chased
him through the streets of Camden on New Year's Day and shot out
the windows of his car. He claimed he returned fire with a
sawed-off shotgun and saw one assailant's head ``explode.''
   A state investigation failed to find a body or any witnesses to
the chase. Asbell resigned and checked into a psychiatric hospital
on Jan. 4 after he was confronted with details of the probe.
   Investigators said Asbell shot out the windows of his own car to
back up his story.
   Roosevelt Nesmith, vice president of the New Jersey chapter of
the NAACP, charged that the plea bargain suggests ``selective
prosecution and a double-standard.'' Asbell had said his assailants
were black.
   ``Did he apologize to the black community?'' Nesmith said. ``It
shows to me very little or no respect for the black community.''
   The NAACP leader has called for the appointment of an
independent prosecutor to review Camden County criminal cases
overseen by Asbell.

<HEAD>NTSB Finds `Slight Indiactions' of Track Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATAVIA, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators said they found evidence a
portion of track shifted before an Amtrak train derailed, injuring
95 people.
   Susan Coughlin, vice chairwoman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, and Dave Watson, investigator in charge for the NTSB,
said Tuesday there were ``very slight indications'' of movement
where the train left the tracks Monday.
   ``There's ballast underneath that track, and anytime that
ballast could shift or the soil could become wet,'' Ms. Coughlin
said. ``It's not a static situation out there.''
   However, Ms. Coughlin said, ``We are not in a position at this
point to interpret any of the findings.''
   Amtrak's California Zephyr was headed to Chicago from the West
Coast with 396 passengers and a crew of 24 when it derailed on
track owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad.
   About a dozen people remained hospitalized Tuesday, three with
what Ms. Coughlin said were serious injuries.
   An eight-member NTSB team is leading the investigation, which
also involves about 40 officials from the Federal Railroad
Administration, the state Transportation Department, Amtrak, the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Burlington Northern.
   The FBI also is investigating the possibility of sabotage, Ms.
Coughlin said at a news conference Tuesday night. The 24-member
crew was tested for drug and alcohol use and those results were
expected in about two days, she said.
   She also said it appeared the Zephyr had not exceeded the 79 mph
speed limit.
   In addition to checking the stability of the track today,
investigators planned to concentrate on a switching device in
Batavia and a 1,240-foot stretch of track from where the train
passed a grade crossing to where it derailed, she said.
   Ms. Coughlin said a fireman who was a qualified engineer was at
the controls as the train crossed a grade crossing just south of
town.
   ``Approximately 1,500 feet later, the fireman who was operating
as the engineer felt the train drag. Up to that point, they
detected nothing abnormal in the performance of the train,'' Ms.
Coughlin said.
   ``He looked back and saw that the rear cars were swaying. He put
his train then into an emergency braking.''
   Ms. Coughlin declined to say whether braking was the correct
procedure.
   Behind the investigators, crews went to work on the twisted rail
and gouged right-of-way in this town of 525 people, situated 90
miles southeast of Des Moines. The double-track route was not
expected to reopen until late today.

<TEXT>
   A series of tropical storms that raged
across Bangladesh killed at least 24 people and tore apart about
10,000 mud and straw houses with high winds, heavy rain and
hailstones, newspapers said today.
   Tuesday night's storms injured about 2,000 people and brought
the season's death toll from storms to at least 250, the papers
said.
   At lest nine people were killed and 500 injured in the latest
storm at Sirajganj, 65 miles northwest of Dhaka, the independent
Bengali-language Ittefaq reported. It was the second time in five
days that Sirajganj was raked by storms. At least 34 people were
killed in storms there on Friday.
   Nine more people drowned in the Surma River near Sylhet, about
120 miles northeast of Dhaka, when their boat sank during a storm,
Ittefaq said.
   Six people were killed and 1,500 injured in Brahmanbaria, 50
miles east of Dhaka, the government-owned newspaper Dainik Bangla
said.
   The summer storms, which began a month ago, are part of the
cycle of natural disasters that batter Bangladesh around the year.
Floods, tornadoes and hurricanes kill hundreds and often thousands
of people every year in this country that ranks among the poorest
on earth.
   Bangladesh's 110 million people have an average per capita
income of $160 a year.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin has appointed a
panel to investigate human rights abuses during the rule of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who has issued warnings about trying to punish
the military for any violations.
   Observers believe the group's work could lead to a number of
rights trials, many involving military officers. That would set the
stage for a potentially risky situation for the newly elected
civilian government, however.
   The 74-year-old general stepped down as president last month but
remains commander-in-chief of the powerful 60,000-men army,
sheltered by a constitutional clause that prevents Aylwin from
firing him.
   There was no immediate comment from Pinochet on Aylwin's
announcement, although he has warned in the past that he would now
allow any of his men to be touched.
   Aylwin announced the establishment of the Commission for Truth
and Reconciliation in a nationwide radio and TV speech Tuesday
night.
   The group's investigation will also cover cases of terrorism
against the Pinochet government, which seized power in a September
1973 coup that ousted the elected Marxist government of Salvador
Allende, who died in the uprising.
   The commission will issue its findings in a report in six to
nine months and will be able to recommend ``moral and material''
compensation for victims of abuse.
   Rights violations constitute ``a wound still open in the
national soul that cannot be heeled by trying to forget,'' said
Alywin, 71, who took office on March 11. ``Closing the eyes in the
face of what has happened, would mean to maintain a permanent
source of pain, division, hatred and violence in our society.''
   The commission includes three prominent right-wing lawyers who
supported Pinochet _ Ricardo Martin, Jose Luis Cea and Gonzalo
Vial, a former Pinochet cabinet minister.
   The other members are considered Aylwin supporters, including
Pablo Zalaquet, a former president of Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights group; Raul Rettig, a former president of
the Chilean Bar Association; and Jaime Castillo, president of the
independent Chilean Human Rights Commission.
   Two women, attorney Laura Novoa, and Monica Jimenez, a social
worker, were also included. The commission's secretary is Jorge
Correa, a law professor.
   The commission also will investigate alleged human rights abuses
that occurred abroad, which will allow it to look into the 1976
car-bomb assasination in Washington of former Foreign Minister
Orlando Letelier.
   After the 1973 coup, the military launched a severe repression
of supporters of the ousted leftist government. Thousands were
arrested, many were tortured or killed. Hundreds were forced into
forced exile abroad.

   A black man testified he helped supply baseball
bats to a group of white neighbors just before a black teen-ager
was attacked and shot to death in what prosecutors allege was a
racial slaying.
   Joseph Russell Gibbons, 21, said Tuesday at the murder trial of
two white men that he and others were carrying bats ``to defend
ourselves ... from the 25 guys who were supposed to come'' to their
Brooklyn neighborhood that night.
   Gibbons said he did not see the shooting, but shortly afterward,
a white youth came up to him and said, ``Joe Fama just shot a black
kid around the corner.''
   Joseph Fama, the accused triggerman, and Keith Mondello, the
alleged ringleader of the white mob, are on trial, charged with
murder in the slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, a black 16-year-old.
   Hawkins and three of his friends, all black, were set upon by a
bat-wielding white mob on the night of Aug. 23 after traveling to
Bensonhurst to look at a used car, prosecutors said. Hawkins was
shot in the chest, allegedly by Fama, 19.
   The slaying raised racial tensions to a fever pitch in the city
during its mayoral campaign.
   The trial was scheduled to resume today.
   In other testimony Tuesday, Luther Sylvester, one of Hawkins'
friends, said he and his friends were walking down the street when
``some white boys ran around the corner and surrounded us. ... They
were shaking their bats saying, `Is this them? Is this them?'''
   Within seconds, the high school senior said, he heard gunshots
and saw Hawkins on the ground, blood flowing from his chest. The
whites fled, he said.
   Sylvester, who was not hurt, said he saw no gun and could not
identify any members of the gang.
   Gibbons, who has lived most of his life in the mainly white,
Italian-American neighborhood, told the jurors that on the night of
the attack, Mondello, 19, had come to him for help.
   Prosecutors say a young woman, Gina Feliciano, had threatened to
bring 25 or more of her black and Hispanic friends to her home to
celebrate her 18th birthday.
   ``Keith asked me if I would be there to defend himself because
Gina said she had 20 to 25 black and Puerto Rican friends coming
down to trash the store and beat him up,'' Gibbons said.
   Gibbons said that as the whites assembled in a schoolyard and
outside a candy store, his best friend, 22-year-old Charles
Stressler, asked him to help carry a box of bats from Stressler's
home. He testified he carried the box and put it down outside the
candy store.
   ``I didn't see who exactly had the bats,'' he said, but
testified that about 30 whites had assembled and about half were
wielding bats.
   Six other whites charged in the attack are to be tried later.

<HEAD>Hyundai Shipyard Workers Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor unrest mounted today as
thousands of workers at the country's largest shipyard went on
strike and protests continued to plague a major automaker and the
state-run broadcast network.
   About 20,000 union workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. in
the southern city of Ulsan walked off their jobs, demanding the
release of four union leaders jailed for organizing labor protests
earlier this year.
   Kia Motors Co., the nation's third-largest automaker, was
crippled today when 7,000 workers who staged a one-day walkout at
its plant just outside Seoul, demanding they be paid for time spent
on union activity.
   The Kia union said the company was trying to suppress labor and
that the union would decide later whether to call a general strike.
Kia, partly owned by the Ford Motor Co. and Mazda Motors of Japan,
produces about 1,500 cars a day.
   Also today, a workers' protest against the state-run Korean
Broadcasting System entered its second week with 5,000 of the
network's 7,000 employees demanding the resignation of the system's
government-appointed president, Suh Ki-won. The workers say Suh is
opposed to reform and stands in the way of greater press freedom.
   About 3,000 broadcast workers staged a peaceful six-mile march
through Seoul this afternoon.
   Officials of the Hyundai shipyard at Ulsan, 200 miles southeast
of Seoul, called the strike illegal and said they were considering
a lock-out.
   News reports said about 3,000 police were deployed at the
shipyard a few hours after Hyundai workers began the strike. The
shipyard, a subsidiary of the giant Hyundai, is the nation's
largest with 24,000 employees.
   A union leader said by telephone that ``virtually all'' of the
union's 20,000 members were taking part in the strike.
   ``We have no other choice, after last-minute labor-management
negotiations broke down,'' said the union official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A Hyundai spokesman in Seoul said the company would try to
reopen dialogue with the workers to avert a ``catastrophic
development.'' Last year, thousands of riot police, supported by
helicopters firing tear gas, stormed the shipyard to end a bitter
three-month strike.
   Today's strike followed two days of work slowdowns by union
members demanding the release of four union leaders in jail for
involvement in what the company called illegal labor activity.
Hyundai said the slowdown cost it $10 million in lost production.
   The comany said the strike was illegal because it did not go
through required legal steps, including a cooling-off period
following the breakdown of negotiations. Union leaders said the
complexity of labor laws makes it virtually impossible for them to
stage a lawful strike.
   The union was scheduled to begin wage negotiations with the
company on Thursday but workers said the release of the jailed
union leaders, not wages, was the subject of the dispute.
   At a rally today, Hyundai workers criticized what they called
``dual government standards'' in handling labor problems.
   They said the government has treated industrial labor protests
differently than the protest at the state-run Korean Broadcasting
System network.
   The Hyundai workers claimed the government was unfair when it
kept in jail four of their union leaders while releasing 117
broadcast workers a day after they were arrested for involvement in
their labor dispute.

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Drug Abusers Still Selling Blood, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a quarter of drug abusers contacted in a
study said they sold blood plasma to collection centers, raising
questions about whether the nation's blood supply is adequately
protected against the AIDS virus.
   ``The continued donation of plasma, and occasionally blood, by
intravenous drug users ... is troubling and warrants further
attention,'' said the study by researchers at the Johns Hopkins
School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore.
   They study was published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The AIDS virus is believed to be spread mainly through sexual
intercourse, shared needles and from infected mothers to their
babies.
   A spokesman for plasma collection centers says they are doing a
good job of excluding infected drug users and keeping the AIDS
virus out of blood products.
   These products include clotting factor used by hemophiliacs and
immune globulin taken by people who need protection against
hepatitis.
   ``The current products that are out there are considered to be
100 percent safe,'' said James Reilly, spokesman for the American
Blood Resources Association, the trade group representing the
approximately 400 U.S. for-profit plasma-collection centers.
   ``There are no known cases of (AIDS) transmission from products
currently on the market,'' he said in a telephone interview from
Annapolis, Md.
   The study found that more than 23 percent of 2,921 intravenous
drug abusers contacted in the Baltimore area in 1988 and 1989 said
they had sold plasma or donated blood after they began injecting
drugs.
   Tests revealed 24.1 percent of those contacted were infected
with the AIDS virus, researchers said.
   The Centers for Disease Control says 126,127 adult AIDS cases
had been reported as of March 31, including 26,883 cases among
intravenous drug users and 8,711 cases among homosexual intravenous
drug users. Transfusion associated AIDS cases total 3,040.
   Since March 1985, all U.S. blood and blood components have been
screened to detect AIDS antibodies, which indicate the presence of
the virus, the researchers noted.
   In addition, plasma from commercial centers is subjected to
processing designed to kill the AIDS virus, although in isolated
cases in other countries the virus has survived in treated plasma
products, said Dr. Kenrad E. Nelson, lead researcher.
   ``This does not mean the blood supply is unsafe,'' Nelson said
in a telephone interview. ``But the fact is that there have been
cases where hemophiliacs have gotten infected despite screening and
heat treatment. I think donor exclusion is vital.''
   Efforts so far have paid off, the study found; the prevalence of
AIDS infections among blood or plasma donors fell from 17.1 percent
in 1985 to 3.6 percent in 1988-89.
   Most of the subjects said they were paid $10 to $15 for giving
plasma, and about 10 percent said they had donated blood at
non-profit blood banks.
   Plasma centers are typically storefront operations that pay
people for giving plasma in a two-hour process that separates the
liquid part of the blood from the cells and returns the cells to
the body.
   Nelson said commercial plasma centers should consider no longer
paying donors in order to further protect the U.S. blood supply.
   The approximately 2,400 U.S. non-profit blood banks, including
those run by the American Red Cross, primarily draw whole blood and
rely entirely on unpaid donors.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Lower in Light Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in calm trading today with
traders focusing attention on the West German mark. Gold prices
fell.
   Dealers said the market was dominated by worries about the
potential inflationary consequences of West Germany's monetary
union with East Germany, slated to go into effect July 2.
   The concern is pulling the mark down against the Swiss franc and
the yen, but is having little impact on dollar-mark trading, they
said.
   One dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said he expected the
dollar to move higher in the medium term, boosted by relatively
positive U.S. economic data in recent weeks and deep-seated worries
about German monetary union.
   ``If the GNP figures are good, perhaps that could finally give
the market the impetus to push the dollar higher,'' he said.
   Dealers said gold is trading at late Tuesday's U.S. levels. But
they said there could be some spark in the market later in the day
or in European dealings Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.10 yen to a closing 159.25 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 159.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6948 West German marks, up from 1.6930
   _1.4825 Swiss francs, down from 1.4865
   _5.6835 French francs, up from 5.6795
   _1.9070 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9100
   _1,242.50 Italian lire, up from 1,241.00
   _1.1600 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1590
   In London, the dollar was unchanged from late Tuesday. It cost
$1.6345 to buy one British pound.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $375.25 a troy ounce,
down from $378.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $374.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $375.25, down from $377.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.02 to close at a bid $375.95.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.03 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.10.

<TEXT>
   It's only a single faucet by the side
of a dirt road, but it's more than the residents of the Sunny Sky
subdivision have ever had in their poor neighborhood.
   Drinking water flowed for the first time Tuesday to more than 40
residents of the ``colonia.'' The border region is dotted with
similar communities of plywood homes and trailers without water or
sewage connections.
   After lawyers used the state consumer protection act to go after
the developer, residents gathered Tuesday at the spigot to
celebrate. They said they hope one day to have water lines all the
way to their houses.
   ``This is very good, because the children have to be clean to go
to school,'' said Eulalio Hernandez, a father of six.
   Socorro de la Rosa, who has three children, smiled as she
watched the water flow into a plastic bucket. ``Let's bathe,'' Ms.
de la Rosa said as she carried a neighbor's laughing 5-year-old and
washed his face in the water.
   She said she had worried about people washing with irrigation
water from the polluted Rio Grande that flows from pipes near the
homes at Sunny Sky.
   Previously, residents of Sunny Sky had to travel about a mile to
gather barrels and buckets of water at another colonia that has
potable water. They will continue to use outhouses in their back
yards.
   The water hookup is the work of Al Alvarez, an assistant state
attorney general.
   Alvarez used the state Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer
Protection Act to get a court order that directed residents'
mortgage payments to his office instead of to the developer. The
money went toward water service.
   The developer ``was telling people there would be water hook-up
and soon there would be sewer service,'' Alvarez said. ``He never
intended to do that. He knew from the very beginning that this
would be an illegal subdivision.''
   The developer never plotted his subdivision or registered it
with Cameron County, as required, Alvarez said.
   The developer, Pete Gonzalez Jr. of Brownsville, said he
couldn't get a water permit because of local opposition to his
low-income subdivision. He also said the plans he tried to submit
were rejected.
   ``I on my own requested water service, but they were never
promised water,'' said Gonzalez, who started the development in
1980.
   ``All I'm concerned about is the people there. I'm a very caring
person. The allegations they made about me are not correct.''
   The state collected $3,170 in mortgage payments from August
until October, when Gonzalez declared bankruptcy, tying up
subsequent payments in bankruptcy court.
   The $3,170 was used to buy a water line to connect with El
Jardin Water Supply Corp. A local Knights of Columbus group donated
the final $694 the residents needed to purchase the meter and final
length of pipe.
   Alvarez said the consumer protection act has been used about 20
times to stop colonia developers.
   ``This type of thing makes us feel good about our work,'' said
Vicky Guerra, an investigator with Alvarez's office as she visited
Sunny Sky.

<HEAD>Rain Falls in Northwest, Fair Weather Over Much of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell over parts of the Northwest today, while fair weather
prevailed across much of the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast calls for rain over the Upper and Lower
Rockies, from Colorado into Montana and North Dakota, and scattered
storms in Texas and the Midwest.
   On Tuesday, storms rumbled through Louisiana, Illinois, Upper
Michigan, parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, eastern Texas and
Oklahoma.
   Showers and storms developed along a cold front extending from
Minnesota to Colorado. Rain also fell over the northern Plains and
the southern Rockies.
   Storms over the Texas Panhandle spawned a tornado and produced
golf ball- size hail south of the town of McLean.
   Forecasters said more severe weather was likely today in
Oklahoma after a tornado caused extensive property damage in
Shattuck.
   Fair skies prevailed from the Southeastern states into the Ohio
Valley and the mid-Atlantic coast.
   The high temperature for the nation Tuesday was 94 at Presidio,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   A year after Colt Firearms drew praise
for pulling its AR-15 semiautomatic rifle off the civilian market,
it is under fire for producing a new version that critics say is
virtually the same weapon.
   The furor over the gun, called the Sporter and produced by the
newly created Colt's Manufacturing Co., has renewed debate over the
Bush administration's policy on assault weapons.
   It also has become a political issue for state officials in
Connecticut, which put up $25 million in state pension funds
earlier this year to help buy Colt Industries' firearms division
and end a bitter four-year strike. The state now owns 47 percent of
the new company.
   Late Tuesday in Hartford, the state House voted 96-49 to approve
a bill requiring permits for assault weapons, including the Sporter
rifle. The bill imposes a 10-year mandatory prison term on anyone
convicted of using assault weapons in carrying out a violent crime.
   Supporters of the bill say they're optimistic that it will be
passed by the state Senate, but opponents pledged to bring intense
pressure on the upper chamber.
   ``This is feel-good legislation,'' said Susan Misiora, a
lobbyist for the National Rifle Association. ``It isn't going to do
anything.''
   Rep. Robert Godfrey, one of the bill's chief backers, said
chances of getting the bill through the Senate were ``pretty
good.'' Other supporters said it was a first step in getting
assault weapons, often the gun of choice for drug traffickers, off
the streets.
   ``The Colt Sporter rifle is no different from the AR-15 and it
should be on the list,'' said Rep. Christopher Burnham.
   Colt Industries voluntarily stopped producing for the AR-15, a
version of the military M-16 assault rifle, for the civilian market
in March 1989, a day after the Bush administration halted imports
of similar weapons.
   At the time, Bush administration drug czar William J. Bennett
called Colt's decision ``an act of civic responsibility.''
   Last week, the new management of Colt's started shipping the
Sporter, a modified version of the AR-15 that the company says is
designed for sportsmen and is not an assault rifle.
   There was no immediate comment from Richard Gamble, president of
Colt's Manufacturing; he did not return a telephone call Tuesday
afternoon. In interviews last week, he maintained that the new gun
differs substantially from the AR-15.
   But Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based group, charged that
the Sporter is simply a cosmetically altered AR-15.
   ``It is clear that Colt is trying to bamboozle the public with
its claim of producing a `new' gun,'' Handgun Control leader Sarah
Brady said last week. ``There is no doubt that this gun is an
assault weapon,'' said the wife of James Brady, who was wounded in
the assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, agreed with the gun control
group. He said the appearance of the new gun on the market
highlights the need for a ban on domestic assault-style weapons.
   In a letter last week, Brady urged Gov. William A. O'Neill to
force Colt to stop production of the gun.
   The characterization of Sporter as an assault weapon is
particularly troubling for O'Neill and state Treasurer Francisco L.
Borges, supporters of a domestic ban on assault weapons.
   ``The Colt management has represented to me that the Sporter is
not an assault weapon,'' Borges said. ``I am currently taking every
step to ascertain the facts.''
   At the core of the debate between Colt's and the gun-control
advocates is defining an assault rifle.
   When the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
permanently banned imports of 43 types of weapons last July, it
defined the weapons as ``semiautomatic assault rifles.''
   The features that lead to such a designation include a folding
stock, a night sight, a flash suppressor that could hide a
shooter's location at night and prevent the shooter from being
temporarily blinded by the flash, an ability to accept a bayonet, a
pistol grip and a large magazine capacity.
   The Sporter cannot be fitted with a bayonet, cannot easily be
altered to fire repeatedly as an automatic weapon, and comes with
only a five-round magazine, one-fourth the capacity of the AR-15's.
   Susan Whitmore of Handgun Control said that while the Sporter is
sold with only five-round magazines, it can easily accept larger
ones and, like all semiautomatic rifles, can be fired as rapidly as
a shooter can squeeze the trigger.
   Handgun Control also points to a pistol grip that allows the
Sporter to be fired from the hip.
   David Conover, a lobbyist for the NRA, said the AR-15 and the
Sporter are essentially the same gun, but the NRA doesn't consider
either of them assault weapons.

<HEAD>Justice Closes Investigation of DC Delegate Fauntroy</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Updates and expands throughout; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department investigation of
payroll practices in the office of Walter E. Fauntroy, the District
of Columbia's delegate to Congress, is closed, with the government
declining to prosecute.
   Fauntroy, who is running for mayor, issued a statement Tuesday
saying he was pleased that ``this will no longer have to divert
attention from the real issues _ like drug, crime and housing _
that are facing our city.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Fauntroy's
lawyers were told of the decision Monday by the public integrity
section of the department's Criminal Division.
   The investigation was begun 15 months ago after a report by The
Associated Press that Thomas John Savage, son of Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., had been on Fauntroy's Washington office payroll while
running for the Illinois legislature.
   Fauntroy said Savage had taken unpaid leave while campaigning
and denied any wrongdoing.
   Asked whether the decision not to prosecute applied to any
inquiry into actions by the younger Savage, Runkel said, ``Today's
action applies only to Delegate Fauntroy.'' He would not elaborate.
   Fauntroy and Runkel declined to answer further questions about
Savage's employment.
   ``The congressman will answer no questions today,'' said
campaign press secretary Ivan Brandon. ``We just want to get out
the good news.''
   After the allegations became public, Fauntroy said Savage had
worked as Midwest coordinator for legislation to grant statehood to
the District, which Fauntroy represents as a non-voting delegate to
Congress. Savage, however, said he made few calls and didn't write
any statehood material. He said his time was spent sending out
statehood material and ``working around'' Capitol Hill.
   Savage said he had reported for work every day he drew a salary.
He earned $21,398 for the period from September 1987 to June 1988.
   In an interview with The Washington Post in March, Fauntroy's
attorney, Abbe D. Lowell, said that Fauntroy ``cannot attest that
Thomas Savage was at his desk every day he should have been, but he
expects them (his employees) to be professional and do their jobs.''
   Lowell said that no one had explained ``what it is that he
(Fauntroy) has done wrong.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Aid to Panama, Nicaragua</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 9 grafs new to include Leahy quotes; picks up 7th graf
pvs, Final passage.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An emergency aid package for Panama and
Nicaragua will pass the Senate easily and President Bush will be
able to sign it soon, a Democratic senator predicted today.
   The Appropriations Committee gave the president's drive for
emergency aid to the two countries a boost late Tuesday by
approving a $720 million economic recovery package.
   On a 15-14 vote, the committee spurned a request by its
chairman, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, to cut the aid to Panama and use the
extra money for a program to help U.S. businesses compete in the
new markets of Eastern Europe.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., had teamed with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., in
seeking to provide just $300 million to Panama this year and a like
amount to Nicaragua. Bush had asked for $500 million for Panama.
   The committee rejected Byrd's proposal and adopted instead an
amendment by Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., boosting the Panama figure
to $420 million, the same amount endorsed by the House on April 3.
   ``I predict that (the aid package) will pass the Senate easily
and the president will be able to sign it into law in a short
time,'' Leahy said today on NBC's ``Today'' program.
   The package, swelled to about $3.4 billion by the addition of
money for a long list of domestic programs, was expected to come up
for debate in the full Senate today.
   Leahy said the aid to Nicaragua probably would be the first
installment in a lengthy program to rebuild that nation's economy.
   ``We are going to have to be committed to Nicaragua for as many
years as we were committed to destroying it with the Contra policy
... I suspect that eventually the United States is going to end up
spending billions of dollars in this tiny country,'' he said.
   Final passage was being delayed until Thursday because some
senators were traveling to Nicaragua for the inauguration of the
new U.S.-backed president, Violeta Chamorro.
   The bill is nearly $1 billion more expensive than the version
the House approved. Like the House measure, most of the new
spending would be financed through cuts in this year's Pentagon
budget.
   Among Senate add-ons to the bill were $110 million for the
Census Bureau to help complete the lagging 1990 population count;
$165.8 million to increase Head Start rolls by an additional 60,000
disadvantaged children; $8 million to fight grasshoppers in the
upper Midwest; $705 million for the food stamp program; and
additional money for veterans' pensions and medical care.
   Another provision would set aside $10 million to build and staff
a new U.S. embassy in Lithuania, should the administration decide
to formally recognize the independence of the Baltic state.
   The measure also adds a provision that would allow the District
of Columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions, language that
brought two presidential vetoes last year.
   The Appropriations Committee claimed nearly $2.8 billion in
savings from the military budget, the first application of a
``peace dividend'' from lessened East-West tensions. The savings
included the effects of a freeze on hiring civilian personnel and
cuts in military construction, weapons procurement and research.
   But the committee restored $238 million for construction of a
new Army explosives plant in Louisiana, the home state of
Democratic Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, a panel member. The money had
been deleted in the House version of the bill.

   Investigators examined a damaged section
of railroad tracks as they sought the cause of a 29-car derailment
that forced an evacuation and fouled an Allegheny River tributary.
   Buffalo &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Inc. and federal authorities on
Tuesday investigated the wreck, which toppled and ruptured tank
cars Sunday.
   Officials estimated 100,000 gallons of crude oil and 10,000
gallons of sodium hydroxide were spilled into Buffalo Creek, a
popular fishing stream about 45 miles north of Pittsburgh. Much of
the material burned off or was caught behind emergency dikes, but
an undetermined amount reached the creek, authorities said.
   Damage to the track indicated the first derailed car may have
jumped the tracks some time before the other 28 did, an official
said.
   George Cochran, an investigator with the National Transportation
Safety Board, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that gouges on the
track bed and rails leading up to the crash site indicated the lead
car, an open-topped hopper, may have crashed without the crew's
realizing it.
   He refused to speculate on whether such a derailment could have
caused the 28 other cars to derail.
   John Bell, the railroad's vice president and general manager,
said company officials and investigators from the NTSB and the
Federal Railroad Administration would compare notes today as they
tried to determine a cause.
   ``We'll put all the factors together ... and come up with a
determination,'' he said. ``In some derailments, there's a single
factor that's responsible. ... Nothing like that has come forward
yet.''
   Results of drug and alcohol tests on the train's two-man crew
were not yet available, Bell said.
   About 55,000 gallons of crude oil remained in four tank cars
still at the scene Tuesday after workers finally extinguished the
blaze.
   Authorities planned to allow the roughly 50 people still
evacuated from the area to return to their homes after the fuel is
removed from the site, possibly today.
   The state Fish Commission said the sodium hydroxide, a lyelike
chemical used to clean drains, killed thousands of fish and that
others caught in the creek may not be safe to eat.
   Environmental officials tried to assess the threat to drinking
water supplies downstream.
   No sodium hydroxide had reached water plants Tuesday in the
densely populated Allegheny River valley, said Betsy Mallison, a
spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Resources.
Most of the crude oil had burned off, she said.
   Authorities as far downstream as Pittsburgh were ordered to test
river water, she said.

<TEXT>
   Artillery battles raged today between
Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and Samir Geagea's militia, setting pine
forests ablaze as the 3-month-old struggle for control of Lebanon's
Christian enclave flared anew.
   Police said at least two people were killed and 12 wounded. That
raised the known casualty toll since the fighting began Jan. 30 to
at least 896 killed and 2,411 wounded, most of them civilians.
   The fighting in east Beirut and other sectors of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave north of the capital broke out
shortly before daybreak.
   The exchanges subsided into intermittent mortar and machine gun
clashes around 8.30 a.m., but fierce howitzer duels broke out again
at midday.
   The escalation came one day after Geagea imposed a sea blockade
on Aoun's makeshift port at Dbaye, north of Beirut, to prevent the
general from shipping in ammunition for his artillery and heavy
weapons.
   Dbaye is Aoun's only outlet to the Mediterreanean. All the other
ports in the Christian enclave are held by Geagea's right-wing
militia.
   Aoun's headquarters said the blockade by Geagea's gunboats was
``an act of piracy.''
   Pillars of flames shot up from the wooded, smoke-shrouded
mountain slopes of the Christian hinterland as radio stations
broadcast an appeal from Maronite Catholic patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir for a cease-fire.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said several shells hit residential districts of
Moslem west Beirut, which has not been involved in the Christian
fighting. But no casualties were reported there.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio station blamed the
escalation on Aoun and noted that the fighting flared after reports
that President Elias Hrawi's government will not pay civil servants
in areas controlled by the maverick general.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily said that Hrawi's
Syrian-backed government will meet next week to adopt a decision to
pay only ``government employees who declare their loyalty to the
legal authority.''
   Aoun does not recognize Hrawi as head of state. He has also
rejected an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war between Christians and Moslems.
   Hrawi is supposed to implement the accord endorsed by Lebanon's
Parliament in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronite Catholics, the largest
Christian sect which has dominated political life in Lebanon since
independence from France in 1943.
   Civil servants in the Christian enclave have not received their
monthly wages since the beginning of the year.
   The battles between Aoun and Geagea broke out one day before
payday in January and Hrawi's government has not transferred funds
from the central bank in west Beirut to cover salaries for civil
servants in the enclave.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi and called on his government to take
over public utilities in areas controlled by his militia, which
include the Christian hinterland in the Kesrouan and Byblos
provinces as well as two isolated pockets in east Beirut.
   Aoun controls the southeast of the capital's Christian sector,
the Metn mountains northeast of the city, and a 3-mile stretch of
coast on the northern edge of Beirut.

<HEAD>British Parliament Cuts Abortion Time Limit to 24 Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's House of Commons has cut the time limit
on legal abortions from 28 weeks, one of the most liberal in the
Western world, to 24.
   Pro-life groups had demanded the time limit be cut to 18 weeks.
But the Commons, in a series of votes Tuesday, rejected calls to
set the limit at 18 weeks, 20 weeks, 22 weeks or 26 weeks or to
retain the 28-week limit.
   The lawmakers chose a 24-week limit by 409 votes to 152 in a
free vote, meaning legislators could vote according to conscience
rather than party lines.
   The new limit will be written into the Human Fertilization and
Embryology Bill, which is expected to become law this year.
   The new limit applies in most routine cases. But in other votes,
the Commons allowed exemptions.
   Abortions now will not be subject to any time limit if an
abortion is needed to prevent grave permanent injury to the
physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, or if substantial
risk exists of the fetus developing into a baby with a serious
handicap.
   On Monday, the House of Commons voted to write into the same
bill a provision permitting continued research into human embryos
up to 14 days after conception.
   The 28-week limit, one of the most liberal provisions in the
Western world, has been in force since Britain first legalized
abortion in 1967.
   Virginia Bottomley, a minister of state at the Department of
Health, backed the abortion law change. She told the Commons:
``Some fetuses of less than 28 weeks gestation, which would at one
time have stood little chance of surviving after birth, now have a
greater chance of survival.''
   Jo Richardson, the spokeswoman on women's affairs for the
socialist opposition Labor Party, said the overwhelming majority of
people in Britain, particularly women, wanted to leave the limit at
28 weeks.
   Legislator Ann Widdecombe, a member of the governing
Conservative Party and a leading pro-life campaigner, cited the
case of a 21-week-old aborted fetus that lived for three hours in a
kidney dish, gasping for life at Carlisle General Hospital in
northwest England, before dying.
   ``To any member of Parliament thinking of voting for a limit
above the 21 weeks ... it would not have saved the Carlisle baby,''
she said.
   Conservative legislator Sir Bernard Braine, who supported an
18-week limit, said that since the legalization of abortion in
1967, up to 3 million children had been lost. ``The overwhelming
majority ... would have been born fit and healthy,'' he said.

   A top right-wing leader says
whites are arming themselves and will retaliate unless Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress ends its armed resistance, a
newspaper reported today.
   Also, two top ANC leaders, general secretary Alfred Nzo and
National Executive Committee member Joe Slovo, were scheduled to
return Friday to South Africa after decades in exile. They will be
part of an 11-man ANC delegation that is to hold groundbreaking
talks May 2-4 with the white-led government.
   The Citizen newspaper quoted Afrikaner Resistance Movement
leader Eugene TerreBlanche as saying white South Africans will
never accept a black government. He said the government is headed
for collapse that will lead to massive unrest.
   ``We will not allow our people to be murdered. It looks to me as
though the government is on the road to capitulation. We are not
prepared to live under an ANC government, which will mean chaos,''
TerreBlanche was quoted as saying.
   President F.W. de Klerk has expressed concern about right-wing
groups that are arming themselves to oppose power sharing with the
nation's black majority. Terreblanche and other extremist leaders
are forming ``commandos'' of armed followers to resist the end of
white-minority rule.
   The minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, told Parliament on
Tuesday that the government was concerned about rightists
unleashing violence. He said some armed right-wing groups were
randomly threatening blacks.
   ``We must take care that we do not allow organizations to be
created that will lead to bloodshed,'' Vlok said.
   Vlok said police officers would not be allowed to join political
parties or groups. Government officials are concerned that some
members of the security forces support extreme right-wing groups.
   TerreBlanche said the ANC must abandon its armed struggle
against apartheid and the white-minority government. Mandela has
refused to end the armed struggle, even though the group's
guerrilla activities have virtually ended.
   ``My message to ANC is that if it persists with its armed
struggle, we will meet it head on,'' TerreBlanche was quoted as
saying by The Citizen.
   TerreBlanche claimed his group was organizing armed white
defense units in towns across South Africa. He said the armed
groups were ready to step in and impose order if the police and the
government lose control.
   TerreBlanche's movement is thought to number a few thousand
activists. But government officials are concerned that heavily
armed extreme right-wing groups could pose a serious threat to
stability if they resort to violence.
   Several air force troopers were arrested in Pretoria last week
on charges of helping an extremist white group steal dozens of
assault weapons and pistols from a military installation.
   The rightists oppose de Klerk's plans to end white-minority rule
and share political power with the black majority. Rightists claim
whites are superior to blacks and the two groups cannot live
together.
   De Klerk is to meet with Mandela and other ANC leaders on May 2
to try to clear the way for full-scale constitutional talks on
ending white rule.
   In another development, police said today that two police
officers and four protesters were injured in clashes in various
parts of the country when officers used shotguns, tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse protesters.
   Police, who gave few details, said 48 protesters were arrested
in various incidents.

   Twenty-nine Princeton students occupied
the university president's office today in a takeover aimed at
forcing the school to offer more counseling for victims of sexual
assault and harassment.
   The students invaded President Harold Shapiro's office shortly
before 9 a.m. Tuesday. Shapiro left his Nassau Hall office shortly
after the students entered.
   ``We don't know how long this is going to go on. We've stated
our demands,'' protester Antonia Merzon said over a portable radio.
   Talks between the students and university officials were at a
stalemate, but student spokesman Matthew Polly said another meeting
was planned.
   Officials said they had no immediate plans to remove the
students but that they could not bow to pressure and increase
funding for a program in the middle of the school year.
   School spokeswoman Jacquelyn Savani said the students' names
were recorded and the university planned to discipline them. If
they end their occupation today, they probably will just get a
warning, but they might be suspended if they continue, she said.
   The students are demanding two full-time counselors at a center
for victims of sexual assault or harassment; currently there is one
full-time and one part-time counselor.
   The students argue that from the 1987-88 to the 1988-89 school
year, the number of students seeking counseling at the center
increased from fewer than 50 to 208.
   ``Harassment and assault issues are not being taken seriously by
the university,'' said a woman holed up in Shapiro's office. She
was interviewed via a walkie talkie radio and refused to identify
herself except to say that she is a sexual assault victim.
   ``I think it's both sad and very counterproductive. The
university cannot respond and make decisions on this kind of
basis,'' Princeton Vice President Thomas Wright said of the sit-in.

   The Bush administration is ruling out any
immediate warming of relations with Syria despite a courtesy call
by President Bush and an official pat on the back for assisting in
the liberation of U.S. hostage Robert Polhill.
   ``While Syria has taken certain positive steps since 1986 to
combat terrorism, including its role in the release of Mr. Polhill,
we continue to be very concerned about the presence in Syria and
Syria-controlled areas of terrorist groups,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday.
   The groups include Ahmed Jabril's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine _ General Command, suspected in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988 in which 270 people were
killed; the Japanese Red Army and the Abu Nidal organization, Ms.
Tutwiler said. The first has its headquarters in Damascus; the
other two are in the Bekka Valley of Lebanon.
   ``Syria's current relations with these groups is an impediment
to better U.S.-Syrian relations,'' the spokeswoman said.
   President Bush telephoned President Hafez Assad on Monday to
express appreciation for Syria's participation in the release of
Polhill on Sunday after 39 months in captivity.
   Evidently, that personal gesture was the extent of any U.S. move
toward Damascus, although Ms. Tutwiler said economic sanctions
imposed by the Reagan administration in 1986 were ``under
continuing review.''
   The sanctions include a ban on certain bank credits, a
suspension of commercial flights between the two countries and a
travel advisory cautioning Americans against going to the Middle
Eastern country.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told
congressional leaders Tuesday that ``he believes Syria had more
than a passing role in the hostage release.''
   Meeting with the leaders in the Cabinet Room, mostly to discuss
Lithuania, the president reiterated that ``goodwill begets
goodwill,'' Fitzwater said. But he said Bush added, ``We cannot
chip away at this problem on an incremental basis. We want the
release of all hostages.''
   The spokesman did not say what Syria had actually done to help
Polhill. He also hedged on whether Iran helped as well, and ruled
out restoring U.S. ties to Iran after a 10-year lapse unless the
seven other captive Americans in Lebanon are freed.
   Fitzwater quoted Bush as saying he thought Iran understood ``our
gratitude for any help they may have provided in the hostage
release, but they also know that the process of normalization
cannot occur until all hostages are released.''
   Other U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Monday that
Iran and Syria would remain on the State Department's list of
countries that sponsor terrorism.
   In the course of Polhill's release, Syria informed the United
States that its ally, Iran, also helped. No details were provided
to support the claim.
   At the White House, spokesman Fitzwater was asked if there were
any indications that another hostage would be released.
   ``I think the most honest answer at this point has to be no,
although there are some encouraging rumblings,'' he replied.
   However, a Shiite Moslem leader in Lebanon today accused the
United States of responding to the release Polhill with ill will
and urged pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants to continue holding
their captives.
   Hussein Musawi, who played a key role in Polhill's release
Sunday, complained that a House of Representatives resolution
Tuesday endorsing a united Jerusalem as Israel's capital
complicated efforts to release another American hostage. ``The
Moslems in Lebanon offered a rose only to get a stone thrown on
them,'' Musawi told a group of visiting Western journalists.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which freed
Polhill, is believed by the State Department to be holding two
other Americans, Jesse Turner and Alann Steen. The Islamic Jihad,
meanwhile, has Terry A. Anderson and Thomas M. Sutherland captive.
The Revolutionary Justice Organization is holding Joseph J.
Cicippio and Edward A. Tracy.
   All three groups are considered by the State Department to be
within the Hezbollah umbrella, under Iranian influence and composed
of militant Shiite Moslems.
   The seventh hostage, Frank H. Reed, is held by Arab
Revolutionary Cells, a pro-Libyan group with ties also to Iran, a
department official said.
   Two other American hostages were killed in captivity. William
Buckley, held by the Islamic Jihad, was reported murdered in 1985,
and Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, who was kidnapped by the
Organization of the Oppressed of the Earth, was reported hanged
last year.

   Police searched today for two gunmen who killed a
leading opponent of Iran's Islamic government in a Geneva suburb,
but there were concerns the suspects might have already fled the
country.
   The rental car used by the assailants was found Tuesday evening
at a parking lot near the Geneva airport, shortly after the
departure of a direct Iran Air flight to Tehran, said Maurice
Gehri, a police spokesman.
   Kazem Rajavi, 56, who publicized Iranian human rights
violations, died instantly around noon Tuesday when his car was
sprayed with gunfire in the Lake Geneva town of Coppet, seven miles
east of Geneva, police said.
   Rajavi was driving to his home in the nearby town of Tannay when
his car was blocked by another vehicle, and one of the two
occupants opened fire with a 9mm bmachine gun, police said.
   Gehri said police found 12 shells at the site of the shooting.
   The car used by the assailants had been rented on Sunday by two
men who showed foreign identity papers, Gehri said. He refused to
specify what kind of identity papers the men had presented to the
rental agency.
   A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
killing appeared to be politically motivated. He said that tracking
down the suspects in such cases is particularly difficult.
   The source noted that Swiss police have not captured the gunmen
who killed an Iranian air force defector three years ago in Geneva.
   Rajavi was the brother of Massoud Rajavi, leader of the leftist
Mujahedeen Khalq resistance movement. The victim was the Mujahedeen
Khalq's Geneva representative and served as a lobbyist to the
Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France and Geneva-based
international organizations.
   He often appealed to U.N. representatives to investigate Iran's
rights situation and held several news conferences during a
February-March session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   During that session, he denounced as a ``whitewash'' a largely
inconclusive report on the situation in Iran released by a special
investigator, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, appointed by the commission.
   Pohl's report listed the names of 700 people allegedly executed
by Iran but also listed 39 people believed killed by the
Mujahedeen. The report also cited evidence of torture and other
violations along with government denials.
   In a statement issued from their headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq,
the Mujahedeen Khalq charged that Rajavi's killing was ordered by
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   It further alleged that the attack was coordinated by Sirous
Nasseri, the head of the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in
Geneva.
   ``Nasseri and the terrorists accompanying him during the
February session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission repeatedly
threatened to assassinate Dr. Rajavi who was actively engaged ...
in the disclosure of the shameful contents of Galindo Pohl's
report,'' the statement said.
   Nasseri was not immediatedly available for comment. A mission
aide who declined to give her name said he was not there.
   Rajavi broke with the Tehran government in 1980 after serving
briefly as head of the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in
Geneva.
   He had been an opponent of Iran's deposed Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi and lived in Switzerland with his French-born wife and
three children for almost 20 years. He was granted political asylum
in 1973.
   The Mujahedeen were first allied with Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini in the struggle to topple the late Shah. But in 1980-81, a
year after Khomeini took power, he turned on the group and other
leftist factions, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of
people.
   The Mujahedeen and their military wing, the National Liberation
Army, receive training and support from Iraq.
   The group is estimated to have 20,000 fighters.

<HEAD>Tibetan Monks Stage Protest Walkout, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Tibetan monks have walked out of
their monasteries to protest a move by Chinese authorities to expel
some of their pro-independence colleagues, a Tibet monitoring
organization reported today.
   The London-based Tibet Information Network said about 200 monks
at the Sera Monastery and ``a large number'' at the Drepung
Monastery in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa staged the walkout last
week after Chinese authorities expelled dozens of monks for
advocating Tibetan independence.
   Efforts to reach the monasteries and offices in Lhasa to confirm
the report were unsuccessful. Chinese telephone operators often do
not connect calls to the remote Himalayan region.
   Lhasa remains under martial law imposed in March 1989 after
nationalist riots, and no journalists have been allowed in recently.
   The Tibet Information Network said a witness in Lhasa, whom it
did not identify, reported that the monks at the Sera Monastery
posted a notice on their gate on April 19 announcing the walkout.
   The notice said Chinese authorities had expelled three monks
from Sera on April 16 and otherwise interfered in monastery
operations. It declared that Tibet was an independent country and
the Chinese should leave.
   An unspecified number of monks at the nearby Drepung Monastery
walked out on April 17 to protest the expulsion of 37 of their
colleagues the day before, the network said. It quoted an
unidentified witness as saying that only older monks too weak to
travel stayed behind.
   The protesting monks are believed to have returned to their home
villages.
   Chinese authorities also expelled 18 monks from the Ganden
Monastery, outside Lhasa and seven from the Jokhang Temple, Lhasa's
oldest and holiest religious site, the network said. It said it
received unconfirmed reports that more than 150 nuns were expelled
at about the same time from four nunneries around Lhasa.
   Buddhist nuns and monks have led repeated independence
demonstrations in recent years and remain loyal to their top
religious leader, the exiled Dalai Lama. From India, where he fled
in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising, the Dalai Lama has
criticized China's heavy-handed rule in Tibet and appealed for
autonomy or independence.
   China insists that its sovereignty over Tibet dates back to the
13th century and refuses to accept any weakening of its control.
However, there were long periods when Tibet had virtually no
contact with China and was ruled by a theocracy headed by the Dalai
Lama.
   In the 1950s and 1960s, the Communists destroyed most of Tibet's
monasteries and banned religious worship. Only in the past decade
have some temples and monasteries been reopened.
   Four times since late 1987, Tibetan independence protests have
resulted in bloody clashes with security forces. Since the last
protests culminated in riots March 5-8, 1989, Chinese authorities
have stationed security forces in all the monasteries and begun
intensive political education of monks and nuns.

   Delegations from both Germanys today began
talks on introducing the powerhouse West German mark into East
Germany's faltering economy.
   The meeting follows an agreement by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and East Germany's prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere,
on a goal of completing monetaRbreak the breeding cycle.
   The last Medfly infestation in South Florida was in 1987, when
five males were found. The state's last major outbreak affecting
commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956.
   Environmentalists in California and here have objected to use of
malathion, contending too little is known about the chemical's
long-term health effects.
   ``The bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that
they wipe out all of the insects in an area _ the good and the
bad,'' said Lee Emerson, a member of the Sierra Club. ``It's not
the kind of balanced, environmentally sensitive approach we should
be taking these days.''
   Joette Lorion, a Miami coordinator of Earth Day, said, ``If it's
a danger to your car and they're asking you to wipe it off, it must
be a danger to your body.''
   The mixture of malathion and syrupy bait can damage car paint if
not rinsed off quickly.
   Officials also said that people with health problems, such as
asthma or allergies, may want to remain indoors during the
spraying. But Conner said of malathion: ``It has not been
determined anywhere to be a health risk.''
   Medflies could strike a harsh blow to Florida's citrus industry,
which was crippled by a Christmas freeze. Medfly larvae hatch
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables, turning
them into mush.
   Bobby McKown, executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual
in Lakeland, said Monday the 12,000-member growers' organization
supports ``immediate action to control and eradicate the Medflies''
so they don't expand beyond residential areas.
   The pesticide to be sprayed per acre consists of 2.4 ounces of
malathion mixed with sticky bait. Malathion is used in a stronger
concentration of 3.1 ounces per acre throughout Florida for
mosquito control.

<HEAD>Israeli Government's Secret Financing of Jewish Housing Criticized</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the leading pro-Israel lobby in
Washington is critical of the Israeli government's secret financing
of Jewish housing in the Christian sector of Jerusalem, according
to sources.
   Through an emissary to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Thomas A.
Dine, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC), questioned the timing of the move into the
Christian quarter of East Jerusalem.
   He told Shamir the Israeli government was ``doing great harm''
to Israel's standing with the Bush administration and the American
public, sources familiar with the criticism told The Associated
Press.
   Although American Jewish groups frequently disagree on a wide
range of issues, it is unusual for AIPAC objections to Israeli
government action to become known publicly.
   Another Jewish group, the Anti-Defamation League, also
criticized the Israeli government. ``This official support given to
Jewish settlers only serves to disrupt the status quo and gives
ammunition to those wishing to upset the religious harmony in the
Holy city,'' the ADL statement said.
   The State Department on Monday sharply criticized the Israeli
government for financing the purchase of a sublease on a
church-owned hospice to be rented to new Soviet Jewish immigrants.
About 150 Jews two weeks ago moved on to the site.
   Israeli courts have ordered the Jews evicted, a decision the
Bush administration welcomed. Removal of the settlers has been
blocked by appeals. The Supreme Court has ruled that they can stay
at least until the next court hearing Thursday.
   Dine called the move ``a provocation,'' said the sources, who
provided information about Dine's statements only on condition that
they not be identified.
   The assertion paralleled the State Department's description of
the purchase as ``an insensitive and provocative action.''
   The Israeli Housing Ministry, controlled by Shamir's hard-line
Likud coalition, contributed about 40 percent of the $1.6 million
purchase of the sublease on the property owned by the Greek
Orthodox Church.
   The ministry for two weeks had denied financing the deal before
admitting it.
   Congress has been considering guaranteeing a $400 million loan
to help resettle Soviet Jews in Israel. The Bush administration has
conditioned its support for the legislation, now before the Senate,
on a condition that Israel not use the money to house Soviet Jews
in the predominantly Arab sector of Jerusalem or on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, territories occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said this week
the assurances had not been received yet, but she noted the
legislation was still pending and that Israel was in the midst of
trying to form a new government.
   None of the $1.2 billion in annual U.S. economic aid to Israel
is supposed to be used to help Jews living on the West Bank or in
Gaza. The Bush administration takes the position their settling the
area poses an obstacle to peace with the Arabs. President Bush last
month called on Israel not to settle Soviet immigrants in East
Jerusalem as well.
   The AIPAC lobby over the years has demonstrated great strength
in Congress and forged winning coalitions among Democrats and
Republicans to defeat several American arms sales to Arab countries
confronting Israel.

<DATELINE>ALON, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a fresh burst of settlement
activity, a crane hoisted seven mobile homes onto a rocky hilltop
in the Judean Desert today, setting up the core of a new Jewish
community in the occupied West Bank.
   The founding of Alon was the latest move in a campaign that has
gained momentum since March when Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took
the reins of a caretaker government without the left-of-center
Labor Party which opposes settlement building.
   Several settler leaders, including Rabbi Moshe Levinger and
Pinchas Wallerstein, watched as bulldozers smoothed the rocky
ground for the mobile homes.
   New residents of Alon, which overlooks the Jordan Valley 10
miles east of Jerusalem, raised wine glasses in a toast.
   ``In five years, there will be a big city here,'' said Eliyakim
Haetzni, a parliament member for the pro-settlement Tehiya Party as
he pointed to the surrounding, barren hills in a sweeping gesture.
   Haetzni criticized the U.S. government, which has opposed
settlement building on territory captured from the Arab states,
including east Jerusalem. President Bush has said such settlements
impede efforts to arrange peace talks with Palestinians.
   ``There are many shades of anti-Semitism. Some are very
civilized, such as calling settlements an obstacle to peace,''
Haetzni said.
   Moshe Waysman, leader of the Alon settlers, said 10 families and
a few bachelors would move onto the state-owned land at Alon today,
and that six more mobile homes would be added in the next few days.
   Waysman said the group had no political aspirations, even though
it was being assisted by Amana, the settlement wing of the
nationalistic Gush Emunim (Block of Faithful) settler movement.
   ``We want to live together in a pleasant environment, to have
some land around our houses and to have a higher standard of
living,'' said Waysman, who owns a food processing factory in
Jerusalem and immigrated to Israel from Australia 19 years ago.
   Alon is not included in the coalition agreement of the collapsed
Likud-Labor government, which called for eight new settlements to
be built by 1992.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the construction did not
violate the agreement because Alon was merely an expansion of the
existing settlement of Kfar Adumim.
   ``This government has not adopted any new resolutions regarding
settlements and only follows what was decided by the national unity
government,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-Communist demonstrators demanding
the resignation of interim President Ion Iliescu thronged a central
square today, and the government threatened to break up the protest.
   Nearly 1,000 people crowded University Square by early afternoon
in a continuation of the round-the-clock protest that began Sunday.
The protest was interrupted briefly early Tuesday, when riot police
moved in.
   Anti-Iliescu protesters also gathered in several other Romanian
cities, unconfirmed reports said, but details were not immediately
available.
   Organizers of the Bucharest rally claim Iliescu, a former
Communist Party official, continues to believe in Communism despite
assertions to the contrary. The organizers say they do not belong
to a political party.
   The Communist Party collapsed in the bloody December revolution
that swept dictator Nicolae Ceausescu from power. Iliescu, who
became a Ceausescu critic in recent years, helped form the National
Salvation Front, which dominates the interim government.
   The vice president of the Front, Nicolae S. Dumitru, told a news
conference today that the anti-Iliescu demonstration was a
subversive, ``right-wing diversion.'' The government has tried ``to
be patient,'' but it will order the demonstration broken up if it
spreads, Dumitru said.
   On the square, groups of anti-Iliescu protesters said they
feared that ballot-rigging would occur in elections planned for May
20.
   ``Parliament has managed things so that the Front will win the
elections,'' said one woman heatedly.
   ``If the National Salvation Front gets hold of power, we have a
disaster on our hands,'' argued a man who held sway over another
small group of protesters.
   Critics of Iliescu say the Front is led by unrepentant
Communists seeking to re-establish their party's rule.
   Also today, a human rights group said there was concern that
Iliescu's National Salvation Front had an undue advantage over
other political groups readying for the elections.
   The International Human Rights Law Group, a Washington-based
rights monitoring organization, said people fear the Front,
``because of its pervasive relationship with the government, has
greater access than other parties to money'' the media and
factories.
   The statement, issued in Bucharest, noted ``widespread
complaints'' that newspapers critical of the Front-dominated
government were regularly deprived of newsprint and printing
facilities, while state television was biased in favor of the
government.
   The group also said they heard reports of violence and
intimidation by Front supporters against the opposition.

   A tornado damaged about 30 businesses in
this western Oklahoma town, cut off electricity and choked streets
with debris.
   ``It went right down Main Street at least half a mile or more,''
said Chris Lee, a cameraman for KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City.
   The tornado destroyed a cafe and a saddle shop late Tuesday, but
it stayed out of residential areas, police dispatcher Don Jeffrey
said. Three or four residents suffered minor injuries, he said.
   Power came on for the first time since the storm while Jeffrey
was speaking to a reporter by telephone about 7:30 a.m. today.
   Firefighters had to clear debris from the front of the fire
department before they could respond to storm calls Tuesday night.
   ``It took me 25 minutes this morning to drive five blocks, so
that tells you how bad it is,'' Jeffrey said.
   Main Street was expected to remain blocked off today, he said.
   Ellis County sheriff's dispatcher Yulonda Taylor said that
before hitting Shattuck the tornado knocked over utility poles as
it crossed a highway about 14 miles southeast of Shattuck.
   The tornado reportedly stayed on the ground for about 30 miles.
   It developed from thunderstorms that erupted from the Texas
Panhandle into western Kansas, the National Weather Service said.
   Hail as big as softballs and tornadoes were reported in the
eastern Texas Panhandle.
   A tornado touched down near the Texas Panhandle town of
Shamrock, about 70 miles southwest of Shattuck, but there were no
immediate reports of injuries or serious damage.

   Two prominent eye doctors are examining
President Bush at Bethesda Naval Hospital to confirm an earlier
diagnosis that he has a mild form of glaucoma, the White House said
today.
   Bush's eyes were being checked today by Drs. Richard Brubaker of
the Mayo Clinic and Harry Quigley of Johns Hopkins Hospital,
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush's own physicians determined during an annual checkup at
Bethesda Naval Hospital on April 12 that he has an early stage
glaucoma. Bush began daily medication at that time.
   Quigley and Brubaker are experts on glaucoma.
   Fitzwater read a statement from Dr. Burton Lee, the president's
physician, saying:
   ``These experts in glaucoma will conduct a series of tests to
confirm our earlier diagnosis and to reevaluate the choice of
treatment. I wish to reemphasize that tere are no problems with the
president's vision. His vision remains excellent. But I feel that
it is prudent to have outside experts assess the treatment
strategy.''
   Fitzwater said the exam was expected to take 60 to 90 minutes.
   After the April 12 physical, Bush began putting drops of a
medicine called Betagen every 12 hours. His doctors said Bush would
need to take the medicine for the rest of his life.
   Glaucoma can lead to blindness if left untreated.
   Before the exam, Bush was also attending a 50th anniversary
ceremony nearby for the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad.
   Brubaker is with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Quigley is
with Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.
   The president's wife, Barbara, is also under treatment for
problems that have interfered with her vision. She has Grave's
Disease, which has caused persistent double-vision.

   Egypt and Jordan said today that a
resolution by the U.S. House of Representatives endorsing a united
Jerusalem as Israel's capital complicates Middle East peace efforts.
   The Cairo representative of the Palestine Liberation
Organization also condemned the non-binding resolution, which was
overwhelmingly approved by the House on Tuesday by a vote of 378 to
34.
   In Beirut, Lebanon, a Shiite Moslem leader said the vote will
hinder efforts to release another American hostage.
   Hussein Musawi, who some believe played a key role in Robert
Polhill's release on Sunday, said he hoped no other hostage would
be freed after ``such a monumental ill-intentioned American
response.''
   A statement by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry voiced ``extreme
concern'' at the passage of the U.S. resolution, which differed
with the Bush administration's official position that Jerusalem's
status must be determined through negotiations among all parties.
   Israel annexed east Jerusalem after capturing it from Jordan in
the 1967 war with the Arabs and declared the united city _ holy to
Christians, Jews and Moslems _ as its ``eternal capital.''
   The Arabs and most world nations, including the United States,
do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
   ``Egypt affirms that adopting such resolutions, which lack a
legal basis and ignore basic human rights, does not help in solving
the present problems in the region but further complicates them,''
the ministry statement said.
   Egypt, the only Arab state having a peace treaty with Israel,
said attempts to solve regional hostilities should take into
account ``the interests and rights of the various parties.''
   Jordan's foreign minister, Marwan Kassem, said the vote ``gives
Israel the excuse and the legitimacy to continue its aggression
against Arabs.'' The vote will harm the U.S. reputation ``as a
peacemaker'' in the region, Kassem said in a statement in Amman,
the Jordanian capital.
   The congressional vote came despite arguments by opponents that
the resolution would cause resentment among the Arab states.
   The resolution was identical to one adpted March 22 by the
Senate.
   President Hosni Mubarak today sent a letter to President Bush
about recent Middle East developments ``including the situation in
Jerusalem and the various views on it,'' the state Middle East News
Agency said.
   Zohdi al-Kodra, the Cairo PLO representative, said Congress does
``not have the right to determine the status of Jerusalem, just as
no country in the world has the right to dertermine the status of
Washington or New York.''
   In comments reported by the Middle East News Agency, al-Kodra
said Jerusalem would always be the capital of a Palestinian state
and that the Palestinian people would continue their struggle until
they formed their state.

<TEXT>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria will visit
Moscow at the end of the month, his first trip to the Soviet Union
in three years, official Damascus Radio reported today.
   Assad's visit comes amid a significant shift in Moscow's
relations with Syria, its closest Arab ally, and a reported cutback
in aid.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and efforts to
establish better relations with the West have carried over to the
Middle East. Moscow has been edging closer to Israel and is urging
radical Arab states such as Syria to moderate their stand and
support the Middle East peace process.
   The exact date of Assad's visit was not announced, and no other
details on it were available.
   The announcement said that ``in response to an official
invitation by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, President Assad
will undertake a working visit to the U.S.S.R. at the end of
April.''
   The radio said the invitation was delivered to Assad by Soviet
officials who visited Damascus, the Syrian capital, last month.
   The visit will be Assad's first to Moscow since April 1987.
   The Syrian announcement gave no hint about what will be on
Assad's agenda in Moscow.
   But the Syrian leader, who has been in power since 1970, last
month decried the reformist wave sweeping Eastern Europe as a boon
to Israel and called for a holy war ``as long as time'' against the
Jewish state. As the Eastern European countries adopt democratic
reforms, they are improving their ties with Israel.
   He also denounced Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel, reflecting
growing Arab fears that tens of thousands of Jews will settle in
Israel in the next few years and set back the fragile Middle East
peace process. Arab countries fear that many new arrivals will be
settled in occupied territories, where the Palestine Liberation
Organization wants to form its own state.
   The expected influx of Soviet Jews follows Moscow's relaxation
of travel restrictions.
   Despite his criticism, Assad stressed in his March 8 speech
marking the ruling Baath Socialist Party's 27th anniversary in
power that ``the relationship between Syria and the Soviet Union is
as firm as ever.''
   However, the Soviets have been stressing to Assad that he
abandon his drive for strategic parity with Israel and have reduced
the volume of advanced weapons it had traditionally supplied
Damascus.
   Western military analysts and diplomats say this cutback, for
economic as well as political reasons, has forced the Syrians, who
have severe economic problems of their own, to look elsewhere for
military hardware.

   A Shiite Moslem leader today accused the
United States of responding to the release of an American hostage
with ill will and urged pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants to
continue holding their captives.
   Hussein Musawi, who is believed to have played a key role in
Robert Polhill's release Sunday, complained that a U.S. House of
Representatives resolution Tuesday endorsing a united Jerusalem as
Israel's capital complicated efforts to release another American
hostage.
   ``The Moslems in Lebanon offered a rose only to get a stone
thrown on them,'' Musawi told a group of visiting Western
journalists, including The Associated Press.
   He said the United States' intentions were demonstrated by the
congressional resolution, which is non-binding. Musawi said the
hostage-holders have been repeatedly urged to prove goodwill by
freeing a captive.
   ``So they did and released Polhill,'' he said.
   ``But upon that release we heard the news of the House of
Representatives resolution on Jerusalem. If every release will be
matched by such a monumental ill-intentioned American response, why
then should any hostage be freed?''
   ``We hope that no other hostage will be released,'' said Musawi,
reputed mentor of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
the group that held Polhill and continues to hold two other
American educators.
   Sunday's release of Polhill after 39 months in captivity raised
hopes that another Western hostage could be freed. Kidnappers are
believed to be holding 17 Western hostages, including seven
Americans.
   Asked about persistent reports that a second American hostage
would be released during Eid al-Fitr, the three-day feast that
begins Thursday to mark the end of Islam's holy fasting month of
Ramadan, Musawi said:
   ``There is plenty of talk about such a move. I don't think Eid
al-Fitr means anything to the Americans, and I don't think there's
an atmosphere of such an early release.''
   Musawi said the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel and its militia ally, the South Lebanon Army, was
``essential'' for any progress toward freeing the remaining
Westerners.
   ``The release of the prisoners with Israel and its surrogates is
a foremost issue and should be simultaneous with the release of the
hostages,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the leader of the South Lebanon Army canceled plans
for a holiday prisoner release because of publicity linking such a
move to Western hostages, sources said today.
   Antoine Lahad, a retired Lebanese army general who heads the
2,500-member force, refused to act on amnesty requests from the
prisoners' families. He had allowed releases for the past two years
to mark the end of the Ramadan holiday.
   His army holds 300 mostly Shiite Moslems in the al-Khiam jail
just north of the Israel border.
   One source speaking on condition of anonymity said Lahad's
decision was affected by publicity suggesting the release would be
a concession to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is believed to be
linked to groups holding hostages in Lebanon.
   Israel radio quoted Lahad as saying the release was turned into
an international affair for no reason.
   ``To my regret, there will be no releases this year because of
the press and (President) Bush,'' he was quoted as saying by the
radio. ``Releasing them now would be seen as an American payment to
the Hezbollah through Israeli agents.''
   The South Lebanon Army said Tuesday that four Lebanese had been
freed after being investigated on suspicion of belonging to a
terror group. Sources close to the army said the release took place
last week and was unrelated to the holiday or the release of
Polhill.
   South Lebanon Army sources had said earlier that they expected
Lahad to free 10 or 11 prisoners for the holiday, and a report in
London suggested more than 30 would be allowed to go home.
   Israel radio said Shiites in southern Lebanon were
``embittered'' by Lahad's decision.
   In Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa received a
letter Tuesday night from his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati, the official Syrian News Agency reported today.
   Officials did not disclose the contents of Velayati's letter
beyond saying it dealt with developments in Lebanon and the Middle
East. Velayati said Monday that information from Lebanon indicated
another Western hostage could be released within days.
   Iran has demanded goodwill gestures such as the release of Arab
prisoners held by Israel and its militia ally as a way to encourage
further hostage releases. Israel holds about 9,200 Palestinians in
connection with the 28-month-old uprising against Israeli
occupation.
   Shiite militants also have demanded the release of 15 radicals
imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait in 1983 before making ``another goodwill gesture,'' Beirut's
independent An-Nahar daily said Tuesday.
   In Tehran, Iran's radical Parliament Speaker, Mehdi Karrubi,
said today U.S. officials were more spiteful of the Islamic
republic now than when Washington launched a failed military
operation in April 1980 to free 52 U.S. hostages in Tehran.
   Polhill, 55, of New York; and fellow U.S. educators Jesse Turner
of Boise, Idaho; and Alann Steen of Boston were abducted in Beirut
on Jan. 24, 1987, by a group known as Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   Polhill, who was taken to Wiesbaden, West Germany, after his
release, underwent more questioning today about his three years in
captivity and about other Western hostages possibly held in the
same building. He was expected to leave for the United States on
Thursday.
   In addition to Turner and Steen, kidnappers in Lebanon are
believed to be holding five other Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   John F. Kennedy may have been fondly remembered
as a president by many people, but to his successor, President
Lyndon B. Johnson, he was ``a Joe College man'' who never had a
clue as a congressman.
   In a vitriolic 1965 interview with historian William E.
Leuchtenburg, LBJ also derided Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal,
ripped the credibility of The New York Times and The Washington
Post, and claimed his administration was the most productive in
U.S. history.
   Excerpts of the previously unpublished interview appear in the
May-June issue of American Heritage magazine.
   Johnson, speaking of FDR's New Deal, compared the four-term
president to ``the fellow who cut cordwood and sold it all at
Christmas and then spent it all on fireworks. It all went up in a
bang.''
   ``He did get things done. There was regulation of business, but
that was unimportant,'' said Johnson. He said Social Security and
labor law changes amounted to something, but ``none of it compares
to my education act.''
   As to Kennedy _ his running mate just five years earlier _ LBJ
asserted that ``no man knew less about Congress than John Kennedy.''
   Kennedy was in the House of Representatives in 1947-53, but
Johnson said his mentor, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, never knew
Kennedy.
   ``The only way Rayburn thought of him at all was as a very young
man who might be going to die of malaria. He was a Joe College man
... and Congress felt that he didn't know where the ball was,''
Johnson said.
   Kennedy contracted malaria during World War II.
   Leuchtenburg says he spent 90 minutes with LBJ, asking just two
questions during the lengthy harangue, and emerged from the White
House meeting stunned by the president's egomania.
   But he had agreed before the interview not to quote LBJ directly
until the president's term was finished. And the historian says
deputy press secretary E. Hayes Redmon told him 95 percent of the
interview could not be used, ``especially about Kennedy.''
   While Johnson was negative about Roosevelt's New Deal, he sang
the praises of his own Great Society. When Leuchtenburg suggested
the then-current Congress was arguably the most significant in
history, LBJ quickly cut him off.
   ``No, it isn't. It's not arguable. Not if you can read,''
Johnson said. ``You can perform a great service if you say that
never before have the three independent branches been so
productive. Never has the American system worked so effectively in
producing quality legislation.''
   Johnson went on to attack the media, singling out the Times and
the Post.
   ``When I came on as president, the Times said one thing sure to
happen is that we would have a closer election in 1964. If the
livelihood of The New York Times depended on its accuracy, they
would be shot at sunrise,'' said Johnson.
   ``One day last week The Washington Post had eleven lies. They
talk about well-informed sources. That just means what they want to
say,'' said Johnson. ``Someday, we'll pass a law stopping them from
using `well-informed.'''

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explosion Kills Five Police Officers in Medellin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today near a truck
carrying anti-terrorist policemen in the city of Medellin, killing
five officers and wounding five, the Defense Ministry said.
   An unspecified number of civilians were killed or injured, and
the roofs of several nearby buildings collapsed, the Caracol radio
network reported.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   However, the Medellin drug cartel, one of the nation's largest,
has pledged to kill police officers as part of its terrorist
campaign aimed at forcing the government to halt its efforts to
crack down on the cocaine trade.
   The police officers belonged to a special anti-terrorist unit
sent to Medellin to fight drug traffickers, a communique issued by
the ministry said.
   The car bomb exploded as the truck was taking the officers to
their posts in the city, 160 miles northwest of Bogota.
   It was the second major car bomb attack this month aimed at
police in Medellin, a drug-trafficking center.
   Caracol said that several bodies could be seen lying in the
street in the city's commercial district after the bomb exploded
today. It said the dead included workers in a nearby shoe store.
   The explosion caused the roofs of the shoe store and several
small factories in the area to collapse, a Caracol reporter on the
scene said. He added that the blast destroyed several vehicles.
   On April 11, a car bomb containing nearly 500 pounds of dynamite
exploded on a busy highway in the city, killing 20 people,
including eight police officers from the anti-terrorist police unit.
   Police blamed the Medellin cartel and its leader, Pablo Escobar,
for the explosion, but no claim of responsibility was received.
   After that blast, police sent 300 additional members of the
anti-terrorist unit to join the search for Escobar and those
responsible for the bomb attack.

   The wife of American hostage Alann Steen today
denied a published report that freed hostage Robert Polhill had
told her that her husband was beaten after a failed escape attempt
in 1987.
   ``I have no idea where this is coming from,'' Virginia Rose
Steen said in a telephone interview from her home in Clark Lake,
Mich. She spoke after today's Boston Herald quoted her
brother-in-law, Craig Steen, as saying that Polhill had discussed
the reputed escape attempt with her.
   Craig Steen was quoted as saying that Mrs. Steen was told that
her husband had escaped from his captors in 1987 and that he also
was seriously ill for a time after his capture.
   ``When you're captured by an enemy, in a declared war anyway,
one of your primary jobs is to try to escape,'' Steen said.
``Evidently, he saw an opportunity and went for it.''
   Mrs. Steen said she talked to Polhill by telephone from
Wiesbaden, West Germany, ``just a couple of minutes'' Monday, the
day after he was freed by Moslem extremists after 39 months in
captivity in Lebanon. They didn't get much chance to discuss
specifics, she said.
   ``We did not talk about that, about the kidnapping stuff,'' she
said.
   She said she and her husband had been good friends of Polhill
and his wife since 1983.
   ``It was wonderful to find out (how good Polhill's) spirit is.
He's a wonderful, brilliant man. ... He said Alann was OK when he
left.''
   Polhill, Steen and a third hostage, Jesse Turner, were
colleagues at Beirut University College when there were kidnapped
in January 1987. Mrs. Steen said Polhill had told her that the
three had stayed together throughout their 39 months in captivity.
   Craig Steen did not immediately return a telephone call to his
home in Orlando, Fla., seeking further comment.
   Newsweek reported in November 1988 that Steen had escaped but
was recognized quickly in a Beirut suburb and recaptured.
Reportedly he was beaten so badly after his recapture that fillings
were knocked from his teeth. Newsweek attributed its story to
anonymous sources.
   Mrs. Steen said she was aware of the Newsweek report.
   Craig Steen was quoted as saying that ``Virginia talked to
Polhill himself, and she gave me some information, but he asked
that the other things that he told her not be released until he is
debriefed.''
   He said the conversation between his sister-in-law and Polhill
was relatively short and included no direct message from Alann
Steen.

   Lithuania is urgently seeking direct trade links
with Soviet regions and factories as a way around the Kremlin's
suffocating economic blockade, a spokesman for the Baltic state's
parliament said today.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania is proposing
the direct links in the hope that regional leaders sympathetic to
the secessionist republic will come to its aid, spokesman Paul
Pauparus said.
   The Kremlin began cutting off natural gas, oil and other
supplies to Lithuania one week ago, stepping up its pressure on the
republic's leaders to rescind laws promoting their March 11
independence decree.
   ``Lithuania's economy is on the brink of collapse,'' the Soviet
newspaper Selskaya Zhizn, or Rural Life, reported today.
   Lithuania's parliament set up a special ``anti-blockade
commission'' Tuesday, naming Prunskiene as its head. She has sought
economic aid from several European countries but has reported
little success.
   Lithuanian officials have estimated that the republic can only
hold out about two to four weeks without fuel from the Soviet
Union, its sole supplier.
   Pauparus said democrats who have come to power in Moscow and
Leningrad, as well as other regions, might be willing to deal with
Lithuania, but their supplies might not be able to reach the
republic along Kremlin-controlled train and truck routes.
   Some Lithuanians have suggested that the republic, which
produces more meat and milk than it consumes, could trade those
items for needed supplies.
   Eduardas Potashinskas, a Lithuanian activist who monitored
today's parliament session, said speakers announced that the
Kremlin decreed a stop Tuesday to Soviet supplies of paper and wood
products to Lithuania.
   The Kremlin has barred Western correspondents from Lithuania,
although it allowed about two dozen journalists to visit its
capital, Vilnius last weekend.
   The KGB said on Tuesday that it had reinforced its units on the
Lithuanian border and increased patrols offshore.
   Lt. Anatoly Parakhin of the KGB, whose forces are responsible
for Soviet borders, did not specify in a Moscow briefing what goods
the secret police were looking for, but he indicated weapons were
on the list.
   ``Control has been established over possible contacts between
Soviet and foreign ships in territorial waters and within the
borders of the economic zone of the U.S.S.R. to avert the transfer
of weapons and ammunition to Lithuania,'' Parakhin was quoted by
Tass as saying.
   ``The movement through the border of all cargo and means of
transportation is being most carefully controlled,'' he said.
   He said the stepped-up control was justified by the discovery on
April 12 of 240,000 rounds of hunting ammunition aboard the Soviet
ship Marat Kozlov, which was sailing to Lithuania from West
Germany, Tass said.
   Pauparus contended the load of hunting ammunition was a normal
annual shipment, and said the KGB implication of something sinister
was ``nonsense.''
   He also denounced a Tass report that a shot had been fired at an
army barracks in Vilnius on Monday night. The shot came through an
open window and shattered an opposite window, injuring no one, the
state-run Soviet news agency reported.
   ``This is once again a provocation or nonsense,'' Pauparus said.
   On Tuesday, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis denounced
the United States for failing to impose economic sanctions in
retaliation for the embargo.
   ``Can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom
of another? What then is the idea of freedom itself?'' the
Lithuanian leader said in a statement released by his press office
in Vilnius, the republic's capital.
   ``This is another Munich,'' Landsbergis said, referring to
French and British appeasement of Nazi Germany that culminated in
the 1938 Munich Pact that sacrificed much of Czechoslovakia to
Germany.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today that the Soviet
Union must allow Lithuanians to exercise self-determination.
   But Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee in
Washington that the Bush administration still was not prepared to
impose economic sanctions on Moscow to force negotiations with
Lithuanian leaders.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania in 1940 along with
the other two Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia.
   A Lithuanian delegation remained in Moscow today trying for a
second day to meet with Kremlin officials, but the republic's
representation in the Soviet capital said no meetings had been set
as of this morning.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his advisers have repeatedly rebuffed
Lithuanian attempts to discuss a possible solution to the crisis.
   The Soviet president has demanded that the Lithuanians first
declare themselves willing to adhere to the Soviet Constitution,
which calls for a referendum on secession and a waiting period of
up to five years.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov spoke informally today with a group of
Lithuanian parliamentarians and journalists about the Lithuanian
dispute. He reiterated previous demands that Lithuania repeal its
independence-oriented laws, journalists reported.

military service on moral grounds is religious persecution.
   The 2-1 ruling Tuesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overruled the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which had
rejected the asylum applications.
   The two Salvadorans are Jehovah's Witnesses, a church whose
members refuse to bear arms.
   The INS said El Salvador's refusal to exempt men with moral
objections to war from military service was not religious
persecution because it applied to everyone equally.
   But the appeals court cited the United Nations refugee agency's
handbook, which interprets international refugee treaties as
allowing asylum claims by conscientious objectors from countries
that do not recognize that status.
   ``A conscientious objector is one whose actions are governed by
conscience, and persecution arises whenever that conscience is
overcome by force or punishment meted out for the refusal to betray
it,'' said the opinion by Judge Eugene Wright.
   The INS could appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Lawyers
for the agency did not return telephone calls to comment.
   Lawyers supporting the Salvadorans and representatives of
Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said it was the first appellate decision in the nation to
grant refugee status to aliens who fled their home country because
it did not recognize conscientious objections to war.
   The case before the court involved Oscar Canas-Segovia and his
older brother Jose, who fled El Salvador at ages 16 and 17 in 1985
because their religion's objections to military service would not
be recognized. They were arrested two days after entering the
United States.
   The brothers fled their homeland after seeing friends taken by
soldiers from street corners and forcibly conscripted into the
military, said their lawyer, Karen Musalo.
   At their immigration hearing, they also offered evidence from a
human rights expert, clergy and others in El Salvador about torture
and murder of those who refuse to join the armed forces.
   Ms. Musalo said the brothers now live in the San Francisco area.
   The 9th Circuit ruling said the threat of imprisonment or other
punishment for refusing military service out of ``genuine
political, religious or moral convictions, or other genuine reasons
of conscience'' was an act of ``religious persecution'' under U.S.
and international law.
   The court also called the threat political persecution, saying
``voluminous and convincing evidence'' showed that Salvadorans who
refused the draft were often viewed as enemies of the government
and faced a risk of torture or death.
   The court quoted an immigration judge as saying El Salvador was
one of 40 nations that refuse to grant conscientious objector
status.
   Judge Procter Hug joined the opinion. Judge Edward Leavy agreed
on the finding of political persecution but dissented on the
religious issue, saying an intent to persecute must be shown.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told workers at an industrial
center in the Ural Mountains today that his economic reforms will
not be successful unless people change their attitude toward work.
   The 59-year-old leader, making his first domestic trip in his
expanded post of executive president, said the country has a
powerful industrial base, scientific potential and educated people.
   But he said workers ``don't have enough incentives or
responsibility.''
   ``On the one hand, incentives are needed so a person has a
different attitude to matters. On the other hand, incentives don't
appear so easily, for psychology is formed over decades,''
Gorbachev told workers on the shop floor of the gigantic UralMash
machine-building complex in the city of Sverdlovsk. His comments
were reported by the official Tass news agency.
   Soviet television showed Gorbachev gesturing with his hands in
animated conversations with UralMash workers.
   The TV correspondent said the chats touched on some of the sore
points in the city, such as shortages of meat, milk and fruit.
About 11,000 of the workers are living without adequate housing,
the reporter said.
   Tass said Gorbachev made the trip to find out if workers will
tolerate tough reforms needed to save the economy.
   ``The Soviet leader well knows how difficult his conversations
will be with workers of the Urals cities with the background of
empty store shelves,'' Tass said as the president left Moscow.
   Gorbachev will try to gauge how the workers ``will take new
social shocks in the near future,'' the news agency said, referring
to a plan to shift the Soviet Union to a market economy.
   No decisions on the new reform effort have been reached yet, and
some reports say the plan will be less ambitious than originally
planned because of fears of major social unrest.
   Foreign reporters were not allowed to accompany Gorbachev to
Sverdlovsk, a closed city known as the home ground of maverick
Communist politician Boris N. Yeltsin and a center for rock music,
which was officially frowned upon until Gorbachev's glasnost
program of greatern openness.
   Soviet spokesmen did not specify why Gorbachev chose Sverdlovsk
for the trip. The Soviet leader has made a habit of staging walking
tours in various parts of the country to get a sense of public
opinion.
   Sverdlovsk residents have taken to the streets several times
over the past months, including a pre-New Year's protest over a
shortage of vodka.
   Party officials stopped the protests by flooding the stores with
reserves of vodka, but many of the city's 1.4 million residents
remain unhappy about the lack of other rationed items, including
meat, sugar and butter, the Soviet press has reported.
   Sverdlovsk is also one of several Russian centers where
Communist Party members recently ousted their local chief and
replaced him with a more progressive leader.
   Members of the anti-communist Democratic Union plan to picket
the sites of Gorbachev's visit, member Tatyana Karelina said today
in a telephone interview.
   She said signs would read ``Gorbachev, Hands Off Lithuania,''
and ``Gorbachev is a Political Turncoat,'' among other slogans.
   Sverdlovsk is also known under its former name, Ekaterinburg, as
the site of the murder of Czar Nicholas II and his family in 1918
by the Bolsheviks. The house where the Romanov family was shot has
since been demolished.

   Robert Polhill underwent more
questioning today about his three years as a hostage in Lebanon,
clowned with his sons and hugged American kindergarteners who sent
him a welcome home card.
   U.S. military authorities said Polhill and his family would
leave for the United States on Thursday. They gave no further
details.
   American officials said on Tuesday that Polhill shared a room
with fellow U.S. academics Alann Steen and Jesse Turner and was
probably in the same building as some of the other Western hostages
held in Lebanon.
   A source, speaking on condition he was not identified, said
today that the U.S. debriefing team was impressed with Polhill's
observant recollection of the conditions and surroundings in which
he was held. The source said officials had learned more from him
than they had from previous hostages.
   But it was not immediately clear whether Polhill had provided
information that would help U.S. officials determine where the
other 17 Westersn hostages are being held in Lebanon or what kind
of physical condition they are in.
   The Boston Herald reported today that Steen had briefly escaped
in 1987 but that he was was recaptured and beaten. The newspaper
quoted Steen's brother, Craig Steen of Orlando, Fla. Craig Steen
said Polhill had conveyed the information in a telephone call on
Monday to Alann Steen's wife, Virginia Rose Steen, at her home in
Jackson, Mich.
   Mrs. Steen later denied the newspaper's account.
   U.S. military authorities in Wiesbaden said in a brief statement
that Polhill, a 55-year-old professor, spent a second ``restful
night'' at the U.S. Air Force hospital in the German city ``and
continues to eat well.''
   Wiesbaden City Manager Reinhold Edel visited Polhill in the
hospital and formally welcomed him to this city along the Rhine
River, presenting him with a case of local German wine.
   Displaying the sense of humor that doctors say helped him
survive 39 months in captivity, Polhill told Edel he hoped there
was a reorder blank with the wine, according to U.S. military
authorities.
   Polhill, freed Sunday in Beirut, told the mayor that he, Steen
and Turner talked often about coming to Wiesbaden and hoped it
would be around the time of the annual autumn festivals celebrated
in many German towns, the authorities said.
   Polhill also posed for pictures on a hospital balcony that was
lined with American flags and draped with a banner saying:
``Welcome Home! Pray For The Others.''
   Cheered by a crowd of about 75 servicemen, nurses, doctors and
fellow patients, Polhill waved and clasped his hands over his head,
kissed and hugged his wife, Feryal, and bantered with sons Stephen,
26, and Brian, 23.
   ``I'm funnier than he is,'' shouted Brian, wearing a camoflauge
jacket.
   Polhill then pointed to himself and gave a thumbs up, then to
his sons and gave a thumbs down.
   ``He says I'm not but I am,'' Brian shouted to reporters and
photographers about 30 yards away. ``He says you're making him feel
really wonderful _ thanks.''
   Polhill also met with 14 American kindergarteners whose parents
are stationed at the U.S. military base. The children had made him
a welcome home card.
   Each child gave Polhill a yellow flower, and one girl handed him
pictures drawn by her class. Smiling and obviously touched, he
hugged several of them and patted two on the head.
   ``I told him that it was nice to have him back,'' said
6-year-old Ricky Houser III from Youngstown, Ohio. He was among the
youngsters who drew and signed the card, which featured a large
teddy bear.
   ``I feel real sorry for him. The people that don't like
Americans always kidnap them _ and that's what I don't like,'' he
said earlier.
   Medical director Col. Kenneth R. Koskinen said Tuesday that
Polhill was intellectually sharp although malnourished and
suffering from a loss of muscle tissue.
   ``He is essentially emptying our kitchen, to say the least,''
Koskinen told a news conference. ``He's eating four meals a day and
ravenously enjoying all the food we're giving him.''
   Koskinen said the professor was very concerned about the other
hostages and very aware ``that if he says something negative that
it might have a negative impact.''
   ``His major concern that he relates to us is that `I'm going to
do all I can to help them be free,''' the doctor said.

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Says No Pro-Democracy Protests This Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng, on the first visit by a Chinese
head of government to the Soviet Union in 26 years, said today
there will be no repeat of last spring's pro-democracy
demonstrations in China.
   However, Li did acknowledge ``minor unrest'' in the far western
province of Xinjiang, where Xinjiang TV reported 22 people were
killed in rioting April 5-6. It was the first such admission by the
Beijing government of the riots, which the regional television
blamed on Moslems trying to start a holy war.
   In a news conference, Li called his visit to Moscow a success
because both nations agreed to reduce military forces along their
border and continue ``good-neighborly, friendly relations.''
   Yet in a clue that the two longtime Communist rivals could not
resolve all their differences, Li said there would be no joint
communique. Such a document is customary for summit meetings.
   Li said no joint statement would be issued because his four-day
visit was so short and ``more time and effort would be needed'' to
work out a communique. He said that each side's concluding
statement would have ``no radical differences.''
   Li said he saw no problems with perserving the ``political
stability'' in China this spring. A year ago, student-led
protesters clamoring for democracy overshadowed the visit to
Beijing by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet visit
ended three decades of strained relations.
   ``Some believe that in April, May or June of this year, more
disturbances will affect China, but I am sure that nothing of that
sort will happen,'' Li said.
   Li emerged as a dominant hard-line force during the turmoil, in
which the army killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesters
on June 3-4 in Beijing, and since then he has tightened controls
over Chinese society.
   ``I believe that a year ago the situation in China could not be
compared to what we have today in China,'' he said. ``Last year,
this time around, I concentrated on handling these very delicate
issues. Now I am on an official visit to the Soviet Union, which
means that the political situation in our country is stable.''
   When asked whether Chinese handling of the demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square could be a model for Gorbachev on handling the
separatist Baltic republic of Lithuania, Li refused to answer.
   ``I think this question was directed to the wrong address. It's
of him that you should ask such questions,'' Li said.
   The Chinese premier, in answer to another question, acknowledged
the unrest in Xinjiang. He did not give a casualty toll but said
the situation has stabilized.
   ``A certain number of criminals there, some thugs, were the
instigators of the unrest, and the settlement was reached in
accordance with the current legislation in China. Now the situation
there is back to normal,'' Li said.
   China agreed to provide state credits to the Soviet Union to pay
for import of Chinese consumer goods, although Li did not say what
goods. The Soviet Union suffers from chronic shortages of basic
consumer goods and has been going abroad for help.
   The Soviet Union will provide a credit to China to build a
nuclear power station.
   The military agreement provides for the mutual reduction of
armed forces along the two countries' 4,350-mile border.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   April 24
   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on hostages:
   The release of Robert Polhill is welcome news and the United
States should encourage terrorist groups to release the 10 _
including seven Americans _ still held captive.
   But the West cannot condone any ``reciprocal moves,'' as Iran
requests, without condoning hostage-taking.
   At worst, Polhill's release is a cynical terrorist bet that the
political advantage of holding hostages is waning. They are trying
to eke what they can with these human beings they view as mere
bargaining chips.
   At best, they are showing an unlikely change of heart.
   In any case, the Bush administration's stand of ``no deals''
appears to be working and should remain intact.
   It may appear hard-hearted to show no response to what is being
touted as a ``humanitarian gesture'' by Iran in calling for release
of Polhill and at least one more hostage.
   But that hard-heartedness pales beside the barbarism of
kidnapping.
   To show reconciliation toward Polhill's tormentors would only
make the West an after-the-fact accomplice to that crime.
   The road Polhill took to Damascus and freedom was long. We hope
fervently that the road will be cleared for the remaining captives.
But we cannot reward cruelty cloaked as magnanimity.

   The Buffalo (N.Y.) News on global warming:
   If there is any hope to be found in results from the White House
conference on global warming, it is that several nations appear
ready now to reduce pollution and prevent the devastating
consequences that eventually could result from a heightening of the
``greenhouse effect.''
   Unfortunately, the Bush administration _ which hosted the
conference _ does not want to include the United States in that
group of forward-thinking nations.
   Instead, in speeches that sounded like they were written by his
chief of staff rather than his environmental chief, Bush lectured
the attending ministers on the ``economic factors'' involved and
called for more study.
   In fact, the president _ bound by a no-tax pledge and exhibiting
a caretaker mentality _ sounded like he might just ``study' this
problem for the rest of his tenure. He could then drop it in the
lap of his successor _ much as his predecessor did with the problem
of acid rain.
   It is a disappointing response not only from someone claiming to
be an environmentalist, but from someone claiming to be a leader.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Lithuania:
   Mikhail Gorbachev's admirers in the West are concerned that
slamming the iron fist on Lithuania might jeopardize the
considerable reservoir of goodwill that exists here for the Soviet
president.
   They have every right to be concerned. Not since the Russian
Revolution has a Soviet leader seemed so promising to the outside
world _ and yet, all that hope is now jeopardized by the
independence crisis in Lithuania. ...
   Because Gorbachev is such an improvement over every one of his
predecessors, we in the West have tended to emphasize _ perhaps
exaggerate _ his qualities as a statesman. ...
   We should ask: Is he intent upon a Russian counter-revolution,
as many of his partisans in the West believe, or are his reforms
mostly cosmetic in nature, a change of some names and reshuffling
of bureaucracies? ...
   We do reserve the right to punish ... Gorbachev for betraying
his expressed ideals. ... Why put off the inevitable? It is far
better for all concerned to talk to the Lithuanians than to
threaten them with reprisals.

   The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel on Lithuania:
   The Soviet Union is showing inexcusable stubbornness in dealing
with Lithuania's bid for independence. Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev has now punished the Baltic republic by cutting off its
oil and natural gas supplies.
   The most frustrating part of this affair is that it still could
be resolved through negotiation.
   At least President Bush finally is letting ... Gorbachev know
that he has gone too far. For weeks, the White House had been
woefully mild in its criticism of the Soviets' handling of the
Lithuanian crisis.
   The Soviet Union needs to understand that there will be
consequences if its bullying of Lithuania continues.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on Earth Day:
   Twenty years ago, Gaylord Nelson came up with the idea of having
a national environmental ``teach-in.'' The event Nelson dreamed up
became known as Earth Day, and more than 20 million people joined
him in observing it.
   With a worldwide audience making Earth Day 1990 an even greater
phenomenon than the original, Nelson is again in the spotlight. And
his message is similar to the one we heard from him in 1970: We can
do better.
   Nelson could tout his role in Earth Day and the environmental
movement. He could dwell on important environmental legislation he
pushed as a U.S. senator from Wisconsin. But he has more important
things to do.
   He continues to speak out on environmental issues as a senior
counselor for the Wilderness Society. He has been a tough grader in
assessing the performance of President Bush and other political
leaders on environmental matters.
   Nelson also continues to display the vision that became evident
even before the first Earth Day. The most important environmental
legislation we could pass, he says, would be to require an
environmental education starting in first grade.
   If we would heed Nelson's advice, future generations would
achieve his goal of making every day Earth Day.

   Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald on Ralph David Abernathy:
   It was (the) Rev. Ralph David Abernathy's fate to live most of
his adult life in the shadow of a friend who became a legendary
figure in the civil rights movement and U.S. history, Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
   It was not easy to be, in succession, the friend of and
collaborator with such a man as he embarked on the course that
would change a country and bring international fame, the man's
chief aide as success and fame grew and finally, with assassination
enhancing the legend, the designated successor who did not have the
extremely rare talents found in King.
   Abernathy, who died (April 17) at age 64, paid a price for not
being all that others in the civil rights movement thought King's
successor should be. In 1977, he was pressured to resign as
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which he
had helped King to create. In the following years, he became
increasingly alienated from and criticized by other civil rights
leaders, climaxed last fall by widespread denunciations because of
what he wrote about King's sex life in his autobiography.
   But the most important period in Abernathy's life _ and the
period for which he should be remembered _ was from Montgomery
(Ala.) in the mid-1950s to Memphis (Tenn.) in 1968. ... This
country is a better place because of what Ralph David Abernathy did
during those years.

   The World, Coos Bay, Ore., on teen-age parents:
   Somewhere, somehow we have to begin breaking the cycle of
poverty and welfare that traps the children who have children.
   Toward that goal, we support new federal rules aimed at
encouraging teen-age parents on welfare to finish up their high
school diploma or its equivalent.
   The rules that go into effect in October are part of the welfare
reform act. They will cut the child support grants for teen parents
by almost half if they can't prove that they are working toward a
basic education. That's not harsh; that's encouraging change.
   In welfare jargon, the action is called a ``sanction'' _ losing
part of welfare benefits for not complying with the rules of the
system. Sanctions are meant to be constructive, though when they
are not applied with some common sense and understanding of
personal situations, they can be detrimental.
   But we can't imagine very many situations when a high school
diploma or GED program would not be appropriate for a teen parent.
   For the most part, the jobs in our society that mean financial
security require a basic education. In the case of a teen parent, a
decent job means financial security for two young people _ the
teen-ager and the young child. More importantly, education and a
job would stop the cycle of welfare dependency at a time when the
teen parents still have the flexibility to change their future. ...
   (W)e have to be ready to offer more than just the requirement of
an education. We'll have to provide both the education and the
other support (like child care) that teen parents will need to make
those changes.

   The Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on children and TV watching:
   No wonder there are problems in the schools. If youngsters 2 to
5 years old are watching television for 25 hours a week, as
American pediatricians report, there is a good reason for problems.
   The warning is based on a study by the American Academy of
Pediatricians. The group cited data from A.C. Nielson Co. which
shows that by the time one of today's children reaches 70, he or
she will have spent seven years _ one tenth of the life span _ in
front of the TV tube.
   Watching TV is a passive, sedentary activity. As the doctors
report, it can lead to obesity in children whose health would be
much better served by sports and active play.
   Much of television's programming is trivial tasteless fare, the
equivalent of yesterday's pulp magazines. Spending that much time
in such an undemanding pursuit leads also to obesity of the mind.
   What's to be done?
   The pediatricians recommend limiting children's viewing to one
or two hours daily and encouraging them to spend other time in
athletics, reading and hobbies. They also support legislation
mandating broadcasting of high-quality programming for license
renewal and requiring at least one hour a day of educational
programs for children.
   The real solution lies with parents. They need to recognize the
perils of excessive TV viewing and to do something about it.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on Clean Air Act exemptions:
   Talk about a mooo-t point!
   Analysts are just getting down to reading all the fine print in
the massive Clean Air bill. As one might expect, lawmakers have
tucked in all kinds of perks or exemptions for special interest
groups. Some amendments are udder-ly a-moo-sing. Take, for example,
the section on cow exemptions.
   Cows, like other creatures, generate stomach gas. They burp and
make other noises because of that gas. When the gas is released, it
is called methane.
   But farmers don't have to worry, because the U.S. Senate has
wisely exempted cows and other farm animals from the requirements
of the Clean Air Act.
   (No, we are not making this up.)
   Congressional Quarterly reports that the bill, as originally
reported out of committee, required a study of various sources of
methane, including farm animals, which supposedly are among the
nation's largest producers of the gas.
   As the Senate debated the measure, cows were granted an
exemption. The move drew sarcastic comments from Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, who said without the exemption, cows would need
catalytic converters to reduce emissions.
   It is funny, but it is also an example of how silly federal
regulators can get sometimes. What if the study had found that cows
do produce huge amounts of methane? What could we possibly do about
it? Put them on a low-gas diet? Issue cow-sized antacids? Or, as
Grassley, suggested, maybe we could install gas collectors or
pollution control units on the cows. Is there a market for cow
methane?
   This sort of silliness goes on too often in Washington, and it
probably would be funnier if we weren't paying so much for it.

<HEAD>Judge Reduces Sentence for PTL's Dortch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today reduced the eight
year sentence for former PTL official Richard Dortch to 2{ years in
return for testimony against others, including ministry founder Jim
Bakker.
   Dortch, 58, was Bakker's former top lieutenant at the Bakker
television ministry. In addition to testifying at Bakker's trial,
he also appeared as a government witness in the recent perjury
trial of former PTL pastor Sam Johnson.
   Dortch was indicted in 1988, along with Bakker, on 24 counts of
fraud and conspiracy for soliciting $158 million from PTL
supporters in exchange for false guarantees of free lodging at the
ministry's Christian retreat near Charlotte.
   In his seven-page order, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter
said the reduction meant Dortch probably would serve between 24 and
29 months, taking into account time off for good behavior. The
judge said without the reduction Dortch probably would have served
40 to 52 months.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year prison sentence in a Minnesota
prison on his fraud and conspiracy conviction.
   Dortch pleaded guilty to reduced charges in return for testimony
for the government. Dortch was sentenced to two consecutive
four-year prison terms and fined $200,000 by Potter.
   Potter did not reduce the fine.
   In his order, Potter said Dortch engaged in serious crimes,
including wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy.
   ``Defendant Dortch not only pleaded guilty and expressed
remorse, but also has been of great assistance to the government in
its prosecutions of other defendants associated with PTL,'' Potter
said.
   ``Defendant Dortch's actions are in sharp contrast with the
actions of his co-defendant Bakker, who has refused to bring
himself to understand that he has committed the violations charged
in the indictments for which he was convicted.''

<HEAD>Angola Announces First Direct Talks With UNITA Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola today announced that it would begin
the first direct peace talks with the UNITA rebels in the next few
days to ``find the path'' to end their 14-year-old civil war.
   Angola's foreign minister, Pedro de Casto Van Dunem Loy, told a
news conference that the talks followed mediation by Portugal, the
former colonial power in the African nation. But he said U.S. and
South African supplies to the rebels could hinder progress.
   There was no immediate comment from the rebels, known as the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA in
Portuguese.
   ``In the next few days, direct contacts with the Union for Total
Independence of Angola will be beginning with the assistance of the
Portugese government, which helped create conditions for the
talks,'' the foreign minister said.
   ``We are convinced the talks will help us find the path to
national reconciliation in Angola,'' he said. He said the exact
dates or location were not yet decided but would be announced soon.
   Van Dunem said the United States and South Africa were supplying
the rebels with logistical aid, weapons and ammunition. South
Africa, he claimed, was sending the rebels military advisers and
armed fighters.
   The military assistance, he said, could sabotage the forthcoming
talks ``and hamper (the rebels') willingness to sit down at the
negotiating table and find non-military means to resolve the
conflict. This military support has allowed UNITA to intensify its
military actions.''
   The rebel group has fought the Marxist government since soon
after Angola became independent of Portugal in November 1975.
   Under a U.S.-mediated peace pact in December 1988, South Africa
was to stop aid to the rebels and Cuban forces were to withdraw.
   The Angolan minister said the Cuban troops, with had fought the
rebels for years, were being withdrawn on schedule, that more than
35,000 had left, and that about 15,000 remained.
   Angola's leftist government, he said, was instituting major
economic and political reforms. He said it was moving toward
liberalization and privatization of the economy, joining the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, and implementing their
market-oriented prescriptions.
   Politically, he said, Angola was adopting reforms that would
ultimately lead to a multiparty political system and free elections.

<TEXT>
   East Germans rushed to their banks Wednesday
to withdraw their savings, hoping to get the best possible exchange
rate with the mighty West German mark.
   While official delegations from both Germanys met behind closed
doors in East Berlin to forge a plan for monetary union, worried
people stood in long lines outside their banks, eager to rescue
some of their savings.
   ``If the West German mark doesn't come soon, I'm going to change
my job,'' one bank teller who was unnerved by the pushing crowds
told The Associated Press. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The high-level negotiations now taking place are based on a Bonn
prosposal for a basic 1-1 exchange rate for wages and pensions.
   However, savings accounts would be swapped 1-1 only up to 4,000
marks. Under the current exchange rate, 4,000 East German marks is
worth about $767, while 4,000 West German marks is worth about
$2,300.
   Savings above 4,000 marks would be exchanged at a 2-1 rate.
   East Germans are well-known savers, having had little to spend
their money on in a Communist society beset by shortages. Some of
those with more money admit to having worked out schemes to benefit
from the exchange.
   ``I've withdrawn all but 4,000 marks and am putting the rest in
the account of a friend,'' said a construction worker on East
Berlin's Alexander Square who refused to be identified. ``That way
we can both end up with more.''
   Aware of the problems, a government spokesman said that the East
German government would seek to negotiate a higher ceiling for
savings exchange rates.
   ``I can't deny that the government wants to set the limit
somewhat higher,'' East German government spokesman Matthias Gehler
said.
   ``About 70 percent of all East German households have savings of
about 5,000 marks,'' Gehler added, indicating that sum may be the
government's target as a limit.
   Monetary union is only one of the problems facing policy-makers
from both East and West Germany in their push toward unification.
   With little more than two months to go before their July 2
deadline, the delegations are also trying to pave the way to an
economic and social union of their two very disparate countries.
   Economic union will mean coordinating budgeting, business and
production growth goals even before the countries are fully
unified. Social union covers broad areas such as unemployment
benefits, health care and education systems.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere appeared for the
first day of what promises to be many rounds of tough negotiations.
   De Maiziere refused to say exactly what would be on the day's
agenda.
   ``I don't want to say anything before negotiations even begin,''
de Maiziere told reporters.

   Medical facilities for victims of the 1984
Bhopal gas disaster are running out of money and may have to shut
down, a senior state official warned Wednesday.
   Compounding problems faced by survivors of the Union Carbide gas
leak, banks here say they are not equipped to handle monthly relief
payments ordered by Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   Treatment and compensation for victims of the world's worst
industrial disaster, most of whom are poor shantytown dwellers,
have been bogged down in a tangle of bureaucracy, lawsuits and
politics for more than five years.
   ``We will be impelled to close down the hospitals and other
health care facilities if financial assistance does not come
through soon,'' said S.R. Sathyam, gas relief commissioner in
Madhya Pradesh state.
   He said the state government had sent an SOS to the central
government in New Delhi.
   The Madhya Pradesh government has spent $21 million in state
funds since the Dec. 3, 1984 gas leak, Sathyam said in an interview.
   ``There is now no money to pay salaries to the hospital staff,
deliver free milk to children, train the gas victims in various
crafts and trades and extend loans to them,'' he added.
   Meanwhile, banks in Bhopal, the state capital, said the central
government's order for monthly relief payments would stretch their
staffs too thin. They suggested quarterly relief payments, since
they cannot afford to hire extra staffers to process monthly
payments.
   Prime Minister Singh visited Bhopal in January and promised gas
victims they would get interim relief payments while his government
fights the $470 million settlement reached by Union Carbide and
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   The Singh government says far greater compensation should be
paid by Union Carbide, whose international headquarters are in
Danbury, Conn. The Supreme Court is reviewing the settlement.
   Under an interim relief plan announced by Singh's government
March 5, a monthly stipend of $11.65 is to be paid to each of
500,000 people living near the now-closed Union Carbide pesticide
plant.
   Bhopal banks say they would prefer to make quarterly payments of
about $35. The monthly payments are supposed to start in June, but
bank sources said logistical preparations were far from complete.
   The death toll from the gas leak rises almost every week as
people who were exposed to the deadly methyl isocyanate die of
respiratory problems and other ailments certified by health
officials as gas-related.
   Last week, the federal government informed Parliament the
official toll had reached 3,730. About 20,000 people are officially
listed as gas-afflicted, and hundreds of thousands of others have
filed damage claims that are still being authenticated.
   Union Carbide contended the leak was the result of sabotage by a
disgruntled employee. The Indian government said it was caused by
negligence and filed suit against the multinational and its local
subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd.
   The Gandhi government initially sought $3 billion in damages
from Union Carbide. The case dragged on through a series of
district and state courts until the Supreme Court assumed complete
jurisdiction.

   Government troops firing flares to
celebrate the start of a Moslem religious holiday ignited a convoy
carrying weapons and ammunition near the Afghan capital, Western
diplomats said Wednesday.
   There were no casualties in Tuesday night's explosion, which lit
up the sky for several hours, said the diplomats. Two trucks in the
dozen-vehicle convoy were destroyed, they said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The convoy, also carrying foodstuffs, had parked about four
miles from Kabul's international airport, they said.
   The report could not be immediately verified.
   Troops manning the garrison camps shot flares into the air for
about an hour to celebrate the start of the three-day celebration
marking the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting.
   Last year, the Soviet-backed government banned its troops from
shooting guns or flares into the sky during the celebration, citing
safety concerns.
   The capital is ringed by mountains where Moslem guerrillas are
hiding. The guerrillas, known as Mujahedeen or Islamic holy
warriors, have been fighting to overthrow the government, which
seized power in a 1978 coup.

   A moderate earthquake hit southern Japan on
Wednesday morning, but no injuries were reported, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
   The agency said the quake's epicenter was near Ishigaki Island,
1,140 miles southeast of Tokyo. It occurred at 11:24 a.m. and had a
preliminary reading of 5.3 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage in a populated area.

   Inmates set fire to a prison Wednesday,
causing damage estimated at $120,000, officials said. It was the
second fire at the maximum security jail in four days.
   More than 200 inmates at the Parramatta Jail refused to return
to their cells after the blaze was brought under control, and tear
gas was used to subdue them, said Angus Graham, director-general of
the Corrective Services Department.
   On Sunday, four inmates were injured during a riot at the jail
in western Sydney. A fire that day caused more than $100,000 in
damage to prison offices.
   Graham said prison guards had no option but to use tear gas
Wednesday. ``They were given the order (to return to their cells)
three times, and they knew what to expect,'' Graham said.
   He said the use of tear gas was an example of the tough measures
the department was prepared to take to quell future disturbances.
   He denied the situation at the jail was out of control.
   ``Today's incident was contained and well-controlled by trained
officers in the face of great provocation,'' he said. ``Any similar
outbreaks will be similarly controlled.''
   A total of 449 prisoners currently are incarcerated at
Parramatta Jail, 15 miles west of central Sydney. The prisoners
made no demands during the disturbances, and the motives for the
unrest were unknown.

<TEXT>
   Four months after a bloody revolution
toppled the Communist dictatorship, an atmosphere of fear and
violence remains, fed by the people's suspicion that holdouts from
the Ceausescu regime will stay in power.
   The interim leadership includes many former Communist officials,
and some Romanians claim there is a deliberate attempt to keep
communism alive, albeit in a less stringent form.
   ``The reluctance in purging the bureaucracy of Nicolae Ceausescu
loyalists has fueled a hysterical distrust among people here, who
suffered like nobody else in the Soviet bloc under the harsh
Communist ruler,'' said Stelian Tanase, a former dissident writer.
   This week, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown
Bucharest, chanting anti-Communist slogans and seeking guarantees
that no former Communists could hold high positions after the May
20 elections.
   The National Salvation Front says it has fully broken with
old-style Romanian communism.
   The front, a loose coalition of former party members, workers,
technocrats and intellectuals that took power in the
post-revolution chaos, has taken some important steps, such as
allowing demonstrations and letting Romanians travel abroad.
   It agreed in February to share power with opposition parties in
the Council of National Unity, the interim government, and went on
record as saying it supports a free market and a multiparty system.
   But it also has aroused suspicions among traditionally wary
Romanians by choosing some top officials with links to Ceausescu.
   The front leader and the interim president, Ion Iliescu, has
praised the ``humane values'' of communism. He is the front's
candidate in the upcoming elections.
   The interim leaders earlier this month withdrew the visa of
exiled King Michael, who planned to visit the country he was forced
to leave 43 years ago.
   The front claims some 800,000 members and is widely seen as the
main contender in the elections. It draws support mainly from
industrial workers, who were promised benefits if the front wins,
and from former Communist Party members.
   ``The front holds a formidable advantage because ... everything
that was obtained by the revolution ... was used as electoral
capital for its own sake,'' Sergiu Cunescu, chairman of the Social
Democratic Party, said in an interview.
   He said about 90 percent of the front members are ex-Communists.
   ``People live in fear,'' he said. ``Workers in enterprises are
asked to sign (support) for the front, and they do sign, thinking
that if they sign they will keep their jobs.''
   ``Those who don't sign are told that in case of economic
hardships they will be the first to be fired,'' he said.
   Tanase, the former dissident who returned from exile in France
after the revolution, said, ``In other East bloc countries, such as
Hungary or East Germany, the Communists lacked any means and
resources to hide under something.''
   ``In Romania, they succeeded in doing this. The Communist Party
has managed to take cover behind the revolution under the mask of
this (National Salvation) front,'' he said. ``They won't stay in
power too long even if they win.''
   Iliescu has rejected allegations his movement operates like the
old Communist Party.
   ``The Front declared a break with the Communist structures,'' he
said in a speech this month. ``A return to the past is impossible.''
   He said private enterprise should not exploit workers, who need
protection from inflation and unemployment through a welfare
program.
   He did not, however, explain how Romania would attract foreign
investment, overhaul its outdated infrastructure and have enough
cash left for unemployment benefits.

   Richard Berendzen, who resigned as president
of American University during a police investigation of obscene
phone calls, is a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, a
hospital spokeswoman said today.
   ``We can confirm that Mr. Berendzen is here at Johns Hopkins. At
the request of himself and his family and physicians, we cannot
make any further comment,'' said the spokeswoman, Joann Rodgers.
   Rodgers said Berendzen had been a patient for ``a bit of a
while'' but refused to say when he was admitted. The hospital runs
a well-known sexual disorders clinic but Rodgers refused to say
whether Berendzen was being treated there, as reported by WUSA-TV
in Washington.
   Berendzen resigned April 10. He is being investigated in
connection with complaints that he made obscene telephone calls,
according to published reports. The calls to women who had
advertised baby-sitting services allegedly were traced by Fairfax
County, Va., police to Berendzen's university office.
   Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney Robert Horan said police were
``looking into certain complaints made against Dr. Berendzen,'' but
would not discuss the nature of the complaints.
   Anita F. Gottlieb, spokeswoman for the university, said it
assisted in the investigation of obscene calls after Fairfax
authorities approached campus security officials on March 29.
   Berendzen's resignation surprised the university community,
where he had been credited with improving the school's academic
reputation and endowment. He was president for 10 years and said in
announcing his resignation April 10 that he was quitting because of
exhaustion.
   An unidentified woman interviewed on WUSA-TV Tuesday night told
the station that a man identified by the station as Berendzen had
made numerous calls to her. She called them ``filthy and
frightening.''
   She said she called police who placed a ``tracer'' and tape
recorder on her telephone.
   Fairfax Police issued a one-sentence statement saying that
Berendzen had not been arrested. Horan said no charges had been
filed and none was expected soon. Making obscene calls is a
misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine or a year in jail or both.
   Edward Carr, president of the university's board of trustees,
issued a statement Monday that Berendzen was stepping aside because
of what Carr called allegations of ``improper behavior'' not
connected with his role as president.
   Berendzen, a former astronomy professor with degrees from MIT
and Harvard, came to American University in 1974 as dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences. He became provost three years later
and president in 1980. One of his major coups as president was to
attract a $5 million donation for a new sports center from Saudi
billionaire Adnan Khashoggi.

<TEXT>
   African nations that don't move toward
democracy can expect cuts in U.S. aid, the State Department's top
official on Africa said Wednesday.
   ``Very important members of the Congress ... are saying we
should direct our assistance to emerging democracies,'' said Herman
Cohen, assistant secretary of state for Africa. ``Democracy is not
a condition of assistance now, but I think it will be in the
not-too-distant future.''
   In the past, U.S. policy has made little differentiation between
dictatorships and democracies in giving aid. Cohen said some
officials had been convinced that one-party rule, as it exists in
many African countries, could be democratic.
   Cohen spoke at a meeting sponsored by the Bretton Woods
Committee, a private group that supports international aid to the
Third World.
   World Bank President Barber Conable and Managing Director Michel
Camdessus of the International Monetary Fund _ the Third World's
two biggest sources of aid loans _ also called for more democracy
in Africa.
   ``I fear that many of Africa's leaders have been more concerned
about retaining power than about the long-term development
interests of their people,'' Conable said.
   Camdessus said the spread of democracy would be a help to
economic reform.
   ``I realize the risks of political turmoil that the process of
democratization can entail,'' he said. ``But I basically believe
that a move to a more pluralistic and accountable form of
government ... can help reforms to succeed, even if there are
temporary costs.''

   The destructive lava flow from Kilauea
Volcano burned five homes in one day and two more this morning, and
threatened the only general store in the area, officials said.
   With the seven houses that have burned Tuesday and this morning,
the lava flow has destroyed 98 homes since Kilauea began its
current eruption in January 1983. Twenty-two homes have burned this
month, and lava continues to spew from the volcano.
   Lanny Nakano, spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense, said
other homes in the 120-home Kalapana Gardens subdivision remain in
immediate danger, leaving residents in this once-quiet community in
shock.
   ``It's real emotional,'' he said. ``Most people have been very
calm, but we still have those who really can't accept it. But
they're finally realizing it's here.''
   The flow was headed toward a church and the only general store
in the area, Nakano said. Loss of the store could seriously
inconvenience residents who have not evacuated, and would deal a
major psychological blow to the already stressed community, he said.
   Because the width of the flow is so large, it is difficult to
predict where it will strike next, Nakano said. ``It's breaking out
at different spots at different times,'' he said.
   Telephone service was lost to the remaining homes in the
subdivision Tuesday evening, and electricity and water service was
disrupted.
   Damage from the volcano is estimated at more than $20 million.

<NOTE>EDs: Subs graf 5, Quayle was, to CORRECT ``flower'' to ``flour''.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today signed a formal
determination that Nicaragua is no longer a Marxist-Leninist
country, restored its sugar export quota and provided $2.5 million
in medical relief.
   The aid will help Nicaragua recover from the economic
``shambles'' the Sandinistas left it in, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The White House announced the aid package for the former
Sandinista government as Vice President Dan Quayle was flying to
today's inauguration of Violeta Chamorro as Nicaragua's new
president.
   Fitzwater said Quayle was bringing the aid package with him to
offer to Mrs. Chamorro.
   Quayle was both cheered and booed when he arrived at the stadium
in Managua where Mrs. Chamorro was to be sworn in. He carried with
him a token gift of flour and cooking oil as a symbolic gesture of
U.S. aid.
   The formal determination that Nicaragua is no longer a
Marxist-Leninist state will make the Central American nation
eligible for Export-Import Bank guarantees and credits.
   The relief is a down payment on the $300 million emergency aid
package for Nicaragua still awaiting approval by Congress.
   ``Despite the celebration of today, President Chamorro faces a
difficult task to restore Nicaragua's economy, which is in shambles
as a result of mismanagement and a flawed economic philosophy,''
Fitzwater said. ``This administration will do everything it can to
help Nicaragua rebuild.''
   Fitzwater said Nicaragua's 2.1 percent share of U.S. sugar
import quotas has been restored. The Reagan administration had
sharply reduced Nicaragua's share in 1983 and then cut it off
altogether in 1985 as part of its trade embargo against the
Sandinista regime.
   The move allows Nicaragua to export 54,328 metric tons of sugar
to the United States. Its share had been cut to 6,000 tons in 1983,
with the rest reallocated to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras.
   Bush had earlier lifted the trade embargo.
   The White House refrained from criticizing Mrs. Chamorro's
reported decision to keep Sandinista military chief Gen. Humberto
Ortega as defense minister.
   ``Mrs. Chamorro is the freely elected president of that country
and we would not comment on her internal decisions,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The Sandinista general is reportedly staying on for a transition
period.
   ``They're not keeping the same economic philosophy. They're
instituting many changes. And I don't think the retention of
Humberto Ortega reflects on the economic course that Mrs. Chamorro
intends to follow,'' the White House spokesman said.
   The medical aid will go to replenish supplies at hospitals and
public health clinics that have run short of medicine. The grant
would represent the first direct U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan
government since 1981.
   Quayle left at sunrise today on a flight for Managua to attend
the inauguration of the political leader whose Feb. 25 election
ended the reign of leftist Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   But as Quayle made final preparations for the two-day trip that
also will take him to Mexico City, Bush on Tuesday scolded the
Democratic-led Congress for stalling on his overall $870 million
Central American aid package.
   The plan also would provide aid to Panama.
   ``I asked that they do that back in March. I asked that the
legislation be finished on April 5. And tomorrow, Violeta Chamorro
is being sworn in as president and we don't have that,'' Bush
complained to a White House audience.
   He appealed to a group of building contractors to ``please call
your friendly senator and tell him to get going and get this
legislation passed ... I'd like to have that legislation intact so
that our able vice president can report that to Mrs. Chamorro when
he goes down there tomorrow.''
   Bush's package is stalled in Congress over unrelated
legislation. On Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted
15-14 to provide $300 million to Nicaragua and $420 million to
Panama.
   Failure to approve the full aid package by Mrs. Chamorro's
inauguration should not be seen as an embarrassment, House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Tuesday.
   ``It is a matter of procedures here,'' he told reporters. ``We
have procedures that obviously have to go forward, and I think
eventually that aid package will be voted.''
   The administration's aid request for Nicaragua is designed to
help that country, among the poorest in the hemisphere, to recover
from a decade of civil war and U.S. trade sanctions. It includes
money to meet immediate needs for planting of crops and for fuel.
   The White House earlier made $3.6 million available to a United
Nations group that is seeking to help demobilize and repatriate
Contra rebels whose guerrilla battles against the Sandinista
government at one time were actively supported by administration of
former President Reagan.
   Officials of the new government have conceded they face a
difficult challenge in meeting the electorate's expectations for a
better standard of living.

<HEAD>New Drug Combination Prevents Kidney Transplant Rejection</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT, time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A form of a natural body chemical appears to
significantly reduce the complications of kidney transplants,
cutting in half the risk that the new organ will be rejected,
according to a study.
   Doctors found that misoprostol, a synthetic version of the
substance prostaglandin, reduced the risk of organ rejection from
51 percent to 26 percent.
   In the comparison study, doctors tested misoprostol in
combination with cyclosporine, a medicine that has been widely used
since the early 1980s to prevent organ rejection.
   Prostaglandins are made by tissue throughout the body and serve
a variety of purposes. Cyclosporine interferes with the ability of
the kidneys to make the substance.
   The study was directed by Dr. Mark Moran of G.D. Searle and Co.,
the pharmaceutical firm that makes misoprostol. The medicine is
currently approved to prevent gastric ulcers that can occur when
people are treated for inflammation.
   The research, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, compared 39 transplant patients who took cyclosporine and
other standard medicines with 38 patients who also received
misoprostol.
   When rejection occurs, patients must receive extra doses of
medicines that suppress their body's disease-fighting immune
systems. While this frequently allows them to keep their new
organs, it leaves them susceptible to infections.
   ``It seems likely that prostaglandin will have several uses,
because of its ability to reduce rejection and improve kidney
function in patients with all sorts of transplants,'' said Moran.
``This also suggests that we may be able to reduce doses of other,
more toxic immunosuppressants.''
   An editorial by Dr. Charles B. Carpenter of Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston said the work appears to confirm animal studies.
He said it should promote more intensive investigation of
prostaglandin therapy.
   In a separate report in the journal, Dr. Jean-Paul Soulillou and
others from the National Institute of Health and Medical Research
in Nantes, France, tested a different approach to blocking
rejection.
   They gave patients antibodies that attacked one variety of
freshly activated white blood cells known as T leukocytes. They
said it worked as well as another treatment using antibodies that
were not specifically targeted against these cells, but it produced
fewer unwanted side effects.

<HEAD>Hosea Williams Hospitalized After Altercation With Abernathy's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Hosea Williams said he missed the
funeral of his estranged civil rights colleague, the Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy, because he was injured in an altercation while
trying to visit the ailing Abernathy.
   Williams and Abernathy's son, state Rep. Ralph David Abernathy
III, both acknowledged that an incident occurred the week before
Abernathy died April 17, but gave differing accounts. Williams
entered a hospital a few days after the incident and remained
hospitalized this morning; Abernathy's funeral was Monday.
   Williams was admitted to Emory University Hospital on April 15
for ``treatment of an arm condition,'' hospital spokeswoman Eve
Patterson said this morning. He could be released as early as
today, she said.
   Williams said Tuesday that he tried to visit Abernathy in
Crawford Long Hospital on April 11, but Abernathy's son told him
that doctors were allowing only family members to visit.
   Williams, a longtime civil rights activist and former Atlanta
city council member, had called Abernathy ``the Judas of the
movement'' after Abernathy's 1989 autobiography described alleged
sexual indiscretions committed by Martin Luther King Jr. the night
before his assassination.
   Williams said he saw the elder Abernathy sitting in a chair
inside the hospital room and tried to enter, when the younger
Abernathy ``grabbed me around my waist and shoved me outside. I
didn't try to hit the boy. I thought about it, but I didn't do it.''
   The younger Abernathy described the incident as a fight.
Abernathy said Williams ``busted on through the door and got
halfway in'' despite doctor's orders and the family's wishes
against visitors.
   ``He threw up a forearm ... to try to push me out of the way. He
hit me across the chest and the shoulder,'' the younger Abernathy
said Tuesday. ``So I grabbed him and pushed him back out of the
door and against the wall.''
   ``I think what happened at the hospital was just Uncle Hosea's
guilty conscience eating away at him,'' the younger Abernathy said.
   Abernathy said his father wasn't aware of Williams' presence
until the incident was over and, when told of it, said, ``No, I do
not want to see Hosea.''
   Asked to comment on Abernathy's version, Williams said, ``I did
not try to barge into the room. It was not a physical thing. Look,
I could have popped Little Ralph's neck off like a chicken if I'd
wanted to. But you just print Little Ralph's version. The Abernathy
family has suffered enough.''

<TEXT>
   About 15,000 Nicaraguans today
gathered in a sports stadium to witness the transfer of power from
the leftist Sandinistas to U.S.-backed President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   Some Sandinista supporters chanted ``Assassin!'' when the black
limosine carrying Vice President Dan Quayle entered the stadium
before the inauguration, and one person threw a rock toward the
vehicle. Other Nicaraguans cheered him.
   On the eve of the ceremony, Mrs. Chamorro infuriated leaders of
her political coalition by reportedly deciding to retain the
Sandinistas' longtime military chief.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, a leader of the Sandinista revolution, is
to stay on for a time to promote reconciliation between the
pro-U.S. administration and the leftists who ruled Nicaragua for a
decade, an administration source said.
   Nicaragua is emerging from nine years of civil war that claimed
30,000 lives and left the economy in tatters, and Mrs. Chamorro,
60, has promised its 3.5 million people peace.
   But by keeping outgoing President Daniel Ortega's brother at the
helm of the military, Mrs. Chamorro would probably make it more
difficult to persuade the U.S.-supported Contra rebels to disarm.
   The upper-class newspaper publisher also runs the risk of
alienating the leaders of the ideologically diverse coalition she
led to victory in Feb. 25 elections.
   ``It is unacceptable that members representative of the FSLN
(Sandinista Front) remain in high-level posts in the army, Interior
Ministry and other government structures,'' the coalition
leadership said in a statement Tuesday.
   The Sandinistas often treated their political opponents harshly,
so it is no surprise that members of the new government wish to see
them completely out of government.
   The leadership of the 14-party United National Opposition
coalition, or UNO, has frequently been at odds with the small
circle of Chamorro advisers that is putting her government together.
   A source close to Mrs. Chamorro told The Associated Press that
leaving Gen. Ortega in place would be a temporary measure and
confirmed a report in the Chamorro family newspaper La Prensa that
the president-elect will at the outset assume the post of defense
minister.
   ``There are some extremists (within UNO) that want the
Sandinistas wiped out in one fell swoop,'' the source said. ``That
cannot be. He (Gen. Ortega) will be eased out, but not for a
while.''
   The Contras and members of the Chamorro coalition have demanded
that the army be purged of Sandinista loyalists.
   President Daniel Ortega said the United States is exerting
``very strong pressure'' on Mrs. Chamorro to avoid fulfilling a
transfer of power protocol and warned that this ``would be chaos
for Nicaragua,'' Barricada, the official newspaper of the
Sandinista Front, said in today's editions.
   Gen. Ortega was a member of the Sandinistas' nine-man
directorate until he quit Monday to honor an agreement to
de-politicize the armed forces.
   All officers in the army and security forces likewise resigned
from leadership positions in the Sandinista Front, presumably
making them eligible to stay on after Mrs. Chamorro takes over.
   The resignations are unlikely, however, to placate many of the
thousands of armed Contras in the countryside who say they will not
disarm as agreed by June 10 unless the army is purged of
Sandinistas.
   The rebels were to begin turning in their weapons today at
specially designated ``security zones'' supervised by U.N.
peacekeepers.
   Discord in the new governing coalition was also evident Tuesday
when the new National Assembly was inaugurated.
   In an internal primary over the weekend, Myriam Arguello of the
People's Conservative Alliance won 28 votes from UNO's 51 deputies
to win the coalition's nomination for National Assembly president.
Alfredo Cesar of the Social Democrats and a protege of Mrs.
Chamorro, received 23 votes.
   But at Tuesday's first session of the new assembly, Ms. Arguello
and her supporters did not return from a recess for a secret vote
on the the legislative president after Cesar appeared to have won
Sandinista support for his candidacy.
   Cesar was rumored to have agreed to support Gen. Ortega's
staying on as army chief in exchange for the votes of the
assembly's 39 Sandinista deputies.
   In Washington, President Bush today signed a formal
determination that Nicaragua is no longer a Marxist-Leninist
country, restored its sugar export quota and provided $2.5 million
in medical relief. The relief is a down payment on the $300 million
emergency aid package still awaiting approval by Congress.
   Even the $300 million would be only just about enough to get
Nicaragua through this year. The money already is too late to boost
the planting season that begins in a week's time, and agriculture
is the backbone of Nicaragua.
   As one of her first official acts as president, Mrs. Chamorro
was expected to place flowers on the grave of her husband, Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, whose assassination helped spark the 1979
revolution that brought the Sandinistas to power.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Assails U.S., Urges Kidnappers to Hold Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed mentor of pro-Iranian
kidnappers urged them to continue holding their Western hostages
Wednesday and accused the United States of sabotaging efforts to
win the release of other captives.
   Shiite Moslem leader Hussein Musawi said a non-binding U.S.
House of Representatives resolution Tuesday endorsing a united
Jerusalem as Israel's capital complicated efforts to free another
hostage.
   ``The Moslems in Lebanon offered a rose, only to get a stone
thrown at them,'' Musawi told a group of journalists from Western
news organizations, including The Associated Press.
   Sunday's release of American Robert Polhill after 39 months in
captivity raised hopes another Western hostage could be freed.
Kidnappers are believed to be holding 17 Western hostages,
including seven Americans.
   Polhill, who was flown to Wiesbaden, West Germany, after his
release, plans to return to the United States with his family on
Thursday, U.S. military officials said.
   Musawi is believed to have played a key role in Polhill's
release. The bearded, soft-spoken former teacher alluded to his
repeated urgings to the kidnappers to show good will by releasing a
hostage.
   ``So they did and released Polhill,'' Musawi said. ``But upon
that release we heard the news of the House of Representatives
resolution on Jerusalem. If every release is matched by such a
monumentally ill-intentioned American response, why then should any
hostage be freed?''
   ``We hope that no other hostage will be released,'' said Musawi,
reputed mentor of the pro-Iranian group that held Polhill, the
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Polhill, 55, a lecturer on accounting, was kidnapped from the
campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College with two
other American educators Jan. 24, 1987. The other two _ Jesse
Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, and Alann Steen, 51, of Boston _ are
still held by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``We expect the hostage-holders to complicate matters and we
hope they will not liberate any of the hostages. The House of
Representatives motion was a maximum ill-intention,'' Musawi said.
   He stressed the word ``maximum'' in English, and otherwise spoke
in Arabic. Musawi heads the Islamic Amal faction within Hezbollah.
Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for groups holding
hostages.
   Asked about persistent reports a second American hostage would
be freed during Eid al-Fitr, the three-day feast that begins
Thursday and marks the end of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan,
Musawi said:
   ``There is plenty of talk about such a move. I do not think Eid
al-Fitr means anything to the Americans, and I don't think there's
an atmosphere for such an early release.''
   Musawi said the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel and its militia ally, the South Lebanon Army, was
``essential'' toward freeing the remaining Westerners in Lebanon.
   ``The release of the prisoners held by Israel and its surrogates
is a foremost issue and should be simultaneous with the release of
the hostages,'' he said.
   Officials in Jerusalem had said Israel and the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army planned prisoner releases this week to mark the
end of Ramadan.
   But South Lebanon Army leader Antoine Lahd on Wednesday canceled
plans to release some of the 300 mostly Shiite prisoners he holds,
sources said. In the past two years he had released prisoners on
the holiday.
   ``Releasing them now would be seen as an American payment to the
Hezbollah through Israeli agents,'' he was quoted as telling Israel
radio.
   Most of the seven Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two
Swiss, one Italian and one Irishman are believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite factions. The longest-held hostage is American
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Asked whether the hostages were all alive, Musawi said there was
no proof anyone was dead. He also said he believed the various
factions holding captives knew one another.
   In Tehran, Iran's radical parliament speaker, Mehdi Karrubi,
said U.S. officials were more spiteful of the Islamic Republic now
than when Washington launched its failed military operation in
April 1980 to free U.S. hostages in Tehran.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Karrubi was speaking on
the anniversary of the U.S. mission to free 52 Americans held
hostage at the U.S. Embassy in the Iranian capital.
   The rescue mission was aborted after two U.S. aircraft collided
at a desert base south of Tehran and eight crewmen were killed.
   Karrubi appeared to be pre-empting any possible thawing of
relations between Tehran and Washington following Polhill's
release. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has urged that the
hostages be released and is believed to favor better relations with
the West.

   Islamic Jihad has said it will not free
the Western hostages it holds until Kuwait releases comrades
imprisoned there for bombing the U.S. and French embassies.
   Seventeen Shiite Moslems were jailed in the emirate for the
bombings Dec. 12, 1983, which killed five people and wounded 86.
One of the dead was the driver who rammed an explosives-laden truck
into the U.S. Embassy.
   Two of the 17 have been released after serving five-year terms.
Of the others, three are under sentence of death, seven were
sentenced to life, four were given 15-year terms and one was
sentenced to 10 years.
   Kuwait has refused to free any of the prisoners. Most are
pro-Iranian Shiites from Iraq, but among those still held are two
Lebanese whose release is believed to be a principal reason for the
kidnappings by Islamic Jihad.
   One of those sentenced to death is Mustapha Youssef Badreddin, a
cousin and brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh, said to be the leader
of Islamic Jihad. Badreddin was convicted as Elias Fuad Saab, the
name on the forged passport he used to enter Kuwait.
   The second Lebanese, sentenced to life in prison, is Hassan
Youssef Musawi, a cousin of Hussein Musawi, leader of another
Lebanese Shiite faction.
   Islamic Jihad and Musawi's Islamic Amal party are associated
with Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Lebanese group loyal to Iran.
Mughniyeh is Hezbollah's security chief.

   A bragging bandit eluded police for weeks,
told store clerks he'd never be caught and christened himself
``Jedi,'' after the knights who used a psychic power called ``the
Force'' in the ``Star Wars'' films.
   The Force was with him Tuesday _ the police force, that is.
   Allen Bonneau, 27, of Pittsburgh, was arrested after a
convenience-store robbery, police said.
   Police charged Bonneau with 15 robberies of fast-food
restaurants, shops and convenience stores in Pittsburgh, two in
suburban Wilkinsburg and one in suburban Bellevue in an alleged
spree that began April 6.
   Police said he told them he was a ``Robin Hood'' who stole money
to give to poor children and buy baby formula for welfare mothers.
   Bonneau's style ``wasn't appreciated by us,'' said Assistant
Police Chief Mayer DeRoy. ``His days of taunting, at least for
awhile, are over.''
   Clerks of a 7-Eleven robbed early Tuesday quoted ``Jedi'' as
complaining: ``I'm not going to rob this store anymore. There's not
enough money. I'm going back to New York.''
   That afternoon, Bonneau was arrested shortly after the robbery
of a Stop-N-Go Foods convenience store, Lt. William Mullen said.
   ``What happened is that he ran out of there, and he was chased
by some people, but he got away,'' Mullen said.
   Police spotted him after a tip from construction workers.
   Bonneau tried to escape by running up the steps of a man's home
and offering $20 if he would say Bonneau was mowing his lawn,
Mullen said.
   ``He told police the reason he called himself Jedi was `I would
rob the stores and jet away,''' Mullen said.
   Police said the robber told clerks he wanted to steal about
$3,000 before leaving the area. The amount ``Jedi'' stole is
uncertain, because copycat robbers may have committed some of the
holdups, police said.

   Pearl's Place, a restaurant that
police say served more drugs than food and was the scene of 12
killings during the past six years, has been ordered closed.
   ``There are a lot of legitimate restaurants, but this just
wasn't one of them,'' Detective John Tucker said Tuesday.
   Circuit Judge Virginia Q. Beverly declared the restaurant a
public nuisance and ordered the restaurant closed by 5 p.m. Friday.
She also ruled that anyone wanting to operate a business from that
building must get special permission from the city.
   Seven of the killings on the restaurant's corner have been
drug-related, and two occurred inside the building, Tucker said.
   During the past three years, police also have investigated eight
car thefts, 29 assaults, 26 other crimes and made 109 drug arrests
in the area, records show.
   The city sued last summer to close Pearl's Place, but the
process took until last week to resolve because owner Pearl
Williams initially requested a jury trial on the closing.
   Attorney Joe Farley, who represents Mrs. Williams, said they
dropped the request and consented to a hearing before Beverly.
   Mrs. Williams was charged last year with six counts of selling
crack and three counts of conspiracy to sell crack. She has not
been tried on those charges.
   Farley doubted the closing would have any impact on lowering
crime in the area.
   ``I'm sure there's not going to be a registered difference once
they close her place down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drug `War Bond' Bill Draws Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration and several Democrats
lined up Wednesday against a popular bill to have schoolchildren
help finance the war on drugs by buying World War II-style savings
stamps and bonds.
   The bill, sponsored chiefly by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.,
carries the signatures of 249 of the 435 members of the House. It
would allow the Treasury Department to issue up to $4 billion worth
of bonds for education, prisons and other anti-drug programs.
   ``As in World War II, I am convinced that the war on drugs will
not be won until we mobilize the American public,'' Lewis told the
House Ways and Means Committee.
   He recalled how as a child he bought 25-cent savings stamp, then
traded in each $18.75 book of stamps for a war bond.
   The Treasury Department objects to the bill because it does not
like special borrowing programs, and department official Michael E.
Basham said the ``Drug War Bond Act'' would be expensive to
administer.
   Several Democrats were more pointed in their criticism.
   ``It's a question of whether we should be borrowing from our
children to teach them the dangers of drugs'' when many of the most
vulnerable are also among the nation's poorest, said Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., who heads the House committee on narcotics.
   ``There's another addiction occurring in this country _ an
addiction to debt,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
   Lewis agreed with Rangel that because of federal budgeting
practices, the bill does not guarantee that even an additional
penny would be available for fighting drugs.
   The intent, Lewis said, is to draw the public into the war and
to make a commitment to finance the fight.
   A galaxy of entertainment stars has lined up behind Lewis's bill.
   Actor Dennis Franz, who was a detective on ``Hill Street Blues''
and plays an anti-drug undercover cop on the ``Nasty Boys'' series,
promised that entertainers would play a big role in promoting the
sale of drug bonds.
   ``We will be spreading a message to everyone watching,
especially our youth, that drugs are not acceptable, that drugs are
not `cool' and that drugs are not safe,'' Franz said.
   Even on that point, there was disagreement.
   ``There is a perception ... that entertainment and sports
celebrities use drugs on a regular basis and encounter few if any
negative consequences. Those messages are most damaging when
delivered by those who are alleged to be recovering from
addiction,'' said Robert J. Hill of Vienna, Va., a former police
officer and recovering alcoholic who heads the Coalition for a
Drug-Free Community.
   Dick Herndobler of Ashland, Ore., who directs the Elks national
drug awareness program, said the proposed bonds would be a welcome
addition.
   Alice C. Donahue, international president of the General
Federation of Women's Clubs, agreed.
   ``By giving individuals an opportunity to do something, even
something so simple as buying a bond, we will help to build a
consensus that drug abuse ... is a problem in which we can and
should become involved in finding a solution,'' she said.
   Ron Sarasin, president of the National Beer Wholesalers'
Association, said his organization will buy the first $100,000 of
drug bonds.

   The United States and Japan reached agreement
today on removing various barriers to the sale of American forest
products in Japan, U.S. officials announced.
   The conclusion of the negotiations on forest products clears up
the final case cited by the Bush administration a year ago when it
placed Japan on a trade ``hit list'' of the countries with the most
offensive barriers to sales of American products.
   In recent weeks, officials had announced agreement on increasing
sales of American supercomputers and satellites in the Japanese
market, the two other products cited.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said that U.S. and
Japanese negotiators had resolved the wood products dispute after
lengthy discussions in Tokyo.
   ``We believe this agreement will provide major benefits to U.S.
exporters,'' she said in a statement. ``Not only will it result in
millions of dollars of U.S. exports, but it will offer lower cost
and high quality wood housing to Japanese consumers.''
   She said the agreement could increase the sale of U.S. wood
products in Japan by as much as $1 billion annually by lowering
tariffs and revising Japanese building code standards.
   The announcement of the successful completion of talks on wood
products came as the Bush administration is facing an April 30
deadline for deciding whether to target Japan for a second year in
a row as an unfair trader under a tough section of the 1988 trade
law known as Super 301.
   Hills said the administration has not made a final decision on
the issue, but she gave strong indications in testimony before the
Senate Finance Committee today that Japan will not be targeted
because of the progress it has made in recent weeks in settling
trade disputes with the United States.
   Several senators, including Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, said it would be a mistake for the administration
to fail to target Tokyo again, given America's huge $49 billion
trade deficit with Japan.
   But Hills insisted that the Super 301 targeting mechanism was
only one of the tools available to force markets open in Japan and
that using it again could jeopardize the progress that has been
made.
   ``Our objectives are all the same _ to open the market for
American businesses,'' she said. ``I must be allowed some
discretion to say which tools should be used.''

<TEXT>
   Pedro Guerrero, who parlayed a $38 investment
in a tamale booth in nearby Guadalupe into the Rosarita Mexican
food company, has died of kidney failure. He was 93.
   Guerrero, a Mesa resident, died Monday.
   Guerrero and a partner began selling tamales at a Yaqui Indian
fair in the Arizona town Guadalupe in 1929. He later invented a
trademark, but it was years before he was able to find partners in
his venture, which in 1945 became Rosarita.
   Rosarita went public in 1959 and was bought by Beatrice Foods
Corp. in 1961. Guerrero retired in 1972.
   Survivors include his wife; three sons, and three daughters.

<HEAD>Heart Medicine Appears to Slow Lung Damage in Cystic Fibrosis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new form of a common high blood pressure
medicine appears to slow the life-threatening lung damage of cystic
fibrosis and could dramatically improve the lives of people with
the frequent inherited disorder.
   The conclusions were from a preliminary study of the medicine
amiloride.
   The medicine, when inhaled in a spray form, seemed to help clear
thick secretions that clog cystic fibrosis patients' lungs. It
reduced the loss of lung capacity by 60 percent when compared to a
dummy treatment.
   Cystic fibrosis strikes about one in 2,500 babies born in the
United States. Only about half of the victims live to their
mid-20s, and almost all of the deaths are from lung disease.
   Because of an inherited abnormality in people with cystic
fibrosis, the cells that line the air tubes in their lungs absorb
too much salt and water. This produces a thick mucous that blocks
the lungs and makes victims prone to infections and breathing
problems.
   Amiloride, a diuretic, appears to work by reducing the lung
cells' absorption of salt and water.
   In the initial study, doctors tried the treatment on adults
whose lungs were already seriously damaged by years of infection.
No one has tried it yet on youngsters whose lungs are still
relatively healthy, but researchers hope it will significantly
change the course of their illness.
   ``Our fantasy is that it could be much more useful if given
early in life over the long haul,'' said Dr. Michael R. Knowles, a
developer of the treatment at the University of North Carolina.
   He cautioned, however, that the diuretic, which is ordinarily
used to prevent water retention, could be harmful to children's
kidneys or have other unwanted side effects.
   Dr. Robert Beall, research director of the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, said that a study is planned that will test the
medicine on youngsters under age 12.
   ``It could increase life exponentially,'' Beall said. ``We feel
that if we can change the environment of the lung so that we don't
give bacteria a good place to live, we might add decades to these
kids' lives.''
   A report on Knowles' initial study, conducted on 14 adults, was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   For two consecutive six-month periods, they used aerosol
amiloride or a placebo. While their conditions did not improve, the
rate of lung damage appeared to be slowed while taking amiloride.
   Cystic fibrosis is now treated primarily by giving antibiotics
and pounding on victims' chests to loosen the mucous in their
lungs. The new approach exploits several years of research into the
underlying abnormality in cystic fibrosis.
   ``What is particularly exciting is that we for the first time
have used a therapy that tries to treat the primary defect, which
is the abnormal movement of ions across the membranes,'' said
Beall. ``We are going to the source of the problem.''
   Amiloride has been available in the United States in pill form
for five years to treat high blood pressure, congestive heart
failure and fluid retention associated with kidney disease.
However, the pills are ineffective against cystic fibrosis.
   Knowles and two other researchers hold the patent on the aerosol
technique. The pharmaceutical firm Glaxo has bought the rights to
produce the inhaled form of the drug.
   More testing will be necessary before permission is sought from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the treatment
routinely available. Until then, cystic fibrosis patients will be
able to obtain the therapy only by enrolling in experimental trials
of the medication.

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last five prisoners abandoned the
roof of Strangeways Prison today to end a standoff that began with
a devastating riot and became the longest prison siege in British
history.
   The prisoners climbed into a crane placed alongside the roof of
the cell block, raising clenched fists and holding each other's
hands aloft as they were brought to the ground. They were then
taken into custody by police in riot gear.
   The prisoners timed their end of the 25-day siege so that it
appeared live on the main British Broadcasting Corp. television
evening newscast.
   Earlier today, squads of prison officers swept into the prison
to try to recapture the prisoners.
   Officials said more than 100 prison officers regained control of
all the prison buildings by midmorning, isolating the last inmates
on the roof of the grim, Victorian jail. No injuries were reported
in the operation.
   Officers huddled just under the roof, poking their heads through
holes made when prisoners ripped out the slate shingles to throw at
authorities during the beginning of the siege.
   During the siege, inmates built and rebuilt barricades and
planted booby traps to keep out authorities.
   The prisoners had ignored a midday deadline. Paul Taylor, 29,
the apparent ringleader, stood on top of a chimney stack, dancing
and performing a mock striptease.
   Weeks of patient negotiations brought out all but the last five
of the 1,650 inmates.
   The siege began with a riot April 1 in the prison chapel that
spread throughout the jail. About 300 prisoners overwhelmed guards
during the Sunday service, took the jail keys and released the rest
of the inmates.
   Running battles raged in the prison in northern England for
about four days and prompted unrest and violence in jails
throughout the country.
   Prison officials had hoped negotiations would coax all inmates
to surrender.
   Through hand-painted signs, makeshift megaphones and talks with
officials, the prisoners complained of poor food, alleged brutality
by prison officials and overcrowding in the prison, originally
built to hold 950 inmates.
   Inmates were held three or four to a tiny cells before the riot,
allowed a shower and change of clothes once a week and provided
with a bucket instead of a toilet.
   One prison officer died in hospital during the riot as a result
of an existing heart condition.

   A smiling gunman who killed one person and
wounded four at a suburban shopping mall had been released 36 hours
earlier from a mental hospital where he had been listed as having
homicidal tendencies, police say.
   The man, wearing a business suit, fired into a lunch hour crowd
Tuesday before he calmly tossed the .38-caliber revolver into a
trash can and surrendered, apparently at the urging of an elderly
man, authorities said.
   ``You don't know what all these people have done to me,'' James
Calvin Brady, 31, was said by authorities to have muttered as he
was led away.
   He was charged with murder and four counts of aggravated assault
and jailed without bail. Two of the wounded were listed in critical
condition.
   During questioning, Brady talked of God and a ``mechanical
device'' inside him that controls his actions, police said. ``He's
suffering from hallucinations. He was probably having one when he
fired,'' said Col. M.F. Ferguson.
   A document found in Brady's pocket said he was released Monday
from Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta. He was admitted to the
state hospital April 13, but the document did not say why he was
released, Ferguson said.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris said today that the reason for Brady's
release was under investigation, but it was not due to overcrowding
at the mental hospital.
   The state is ``sincere in trying ... to do everything that we
can to prevent something like this from happening,'' Harris added.
``In this case, I think it was being done.''
   The document ``said he had homicidal and suicidal tendencies,
and suffered from delusions,'' Ferguson said. Brady ``can be
hostile, threatening, and has a history of alcohol abuse,'' the
colonel quoted it as saying.
   Marchant Roach, spokesman for the state Department of Human
Resources, which runs the state hospitals, said the department
would not comment on any patient.
   Officers said Brady bought the snub-nosed revolver and 12 rounds
of hollow-point ammunition, a type designed to expand on impact and
cause especially severe wounds, for $129 at a pawn shop in Atlanta
on Monday.
   ``How did he get the gun? Why did he get the gun?'' Detective
Lt. Rodney Maddox said. ``We don't have a good answer to that and
may never know why.''
   Georgia law does not restrict the sale of handguns or rifles but
requires a license for anyone who carries a concealable weapon.
Such a license cannot be obtained within five years of release from
a psychiatric hospital.
   Once inside the mall's food court, Brady appeared to fire at
random, police and witnesses said.
   ``He looked like a businessman with his left hand in his pants
pocket,'' said Carol Gravdahl, a store manager at Perimeter Mall, a
few miles north of the city. ``His right arm was straight out with
a pistol, shooting it off randomly. He was coming around with it
until I guess he emptied it _ and he was smiling.''
   After firing six shots, Bradhy attempted to reload, but an
elderly man apparently talked him out of it, police said.
   ``There may be a hero in this thing,'' Ferguson said. ``We still
don't know who he is, but we'd sure like to talk to him. We'd like
to know what he said to him.''
   Michael Gregory Musick, 24, of suburban Norcross, was shot in
the chest and died at Northside Hospital, police said.
   Craig E. Bruno, 23, of Roswell, was shot in the abdomen and was
listed in stable condition today. Lucille Hughey, 74, of Decatur,
was wounded in the side and was listed in critical but stable
condition after surgery. Judy Shell, 53, of Roswell, was shot in
the legs and listed in stable condition.
   James McDonald, 30, of Alpharetta, was treated at a hospital for
a gunshot wound to the ankle and was released.
   Rambling, disjointed notes found in an Atlanta apartment from
which Brady was evicted Tuesday morning said he had taken crack and
then met two people in California who created a machine that would
control his mind.
   ``If I got the public at large outcry and attention of why I
became insane, the public would bring these (two people) to
accounting,'' the notes said.

   Angry policemen chanting ``Blood for
blood!'' called for revenge Wednesday at the funeral of five
officers who were beaten to death by mobs earlier this week.
   ``Stop atrocities on policemen on duty. Hang the home
minister!'' shouted about 150 policemen as the remains of the five
officers killed Monday were cremated.
   A total of six officers were killed Monday, but it was not
immediately known if the other was cremated separately.
   Police had been closely linked to the non-partisan government
dominated by King Birendra. They have come under increased attack
since a new government headed by pro-democracy forces was installed
last week.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew restricting residents to their homes
remained in effect in Katmandu, Nepal's capital. It was imposed
after Monday's bloody clashes between police and mobs, who accused
officers of having links to a right-wing group opposed to the
democratic changes.
   Hundreds of police officers refused to report to work Tuesday to
protest the mob attacks, but many officers reported for duty
Wednesday.
   Birendra on Wednesday appealed for calm to give the country's
new multiparty democracy a chance.
   ``It should be everybody's concern to see multiparty democracy
succeed,'' Birendra said. ``His Majesty is confident that all

   The sheer size of dinosaurs may have helped them
live in a variety of climates without getting too hot or cold, a
study of huge turtles suggests.
   Researchers found evidence that large cold-blooded animals can
keep constant high body temperatures by large body size, low
metabolic rate and the use of some peripheral tissues as insulation.
   The study focused on leatherback turtles, which are among the
largest living reptiles. They can weigh more than 1,500 pounds.
   The turtles range from the tropics to near the Arctic circle.
They can warm up on land and keep elevated body temperatures in
cold seawater, researchers said.
   Scientists measured metabolic rates of six adult females and
mathematically analyzed the turtles' ability to maintain a
relatively high internal temperature.
   Leatherbacks may restrict the flow of blood to the skin to keep
warm and increase it to avoid overheating, researchers said.
Support for that idea comes in the observation that the turtles'
soft skin appears to be flushed with blood while the animal nests,
the researchers said.
   The scientists suggested that their proposed
temperature-regulating system for large animals be called
``gigantothermy.''
   Such a system may have allowed dinosaurs to live in a wide
variety of habitats, including polar regions, the researchers said.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by scientists from Drexel University in Philadelphia and
Purdue University in Fort Wayne, Ind.

<HEAD>Downtown Mall Bans Teen-Agers on Weekday Afternoons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoppers are welcome to browse at the
downtown ParkFair Mall, but teen-age buyers beware _ because of
rowdy behavior, the mall has banned unescorted youths on weekday
afternoons.
   The three-tiered mall has been the site of recent, after-school
brawls.
   Teen-agers assaulted two police officers trying to break up two
fights March 30. More than 100 youths were dispersed and four
teen-agers were arrested.
   ``I was here that day and I was scared,'' a woman who refused to
give her name said last week. ``It was getting rather treacherous
with the kids.''
   The often bustling mall was relatively quiet that day. Tables at
the ground floor fast-food restaurants were largely empty.
   ``Our business is down,'' said one fast-food clerk, Naeem
Muhammad. ``But the theory is when we get this cleaned up other
people will come down.''
   Some patrons and shop clerks questioned whether banning an
entire group of people from the mall between 2:30 p.m. and 4:30
p.m. was the answer.
   ``They can come in here and act like ladies and gentlemen,''
said Rose Shaffer, 52, who goes to the mall three or four times a
week. ``They shouldn't punish them all.''
   One 16-year-old turned away from the mall when he didn't produce
any identification said the policy was aimed at blacks.
   ``They ain't sweatin' it for whites,'' said Ed Young. ``This
whole dilemma is strictly racial.''
   Police are frustrated by lack of cooperation when trouble occurs.
   ``We have kids coming out ... yelling racism and police
brutality and that stuff,'' Sgt. Garry Gernandt said while on foot
patrol around the mall.
   ``I think basically the problem is you got 10 percent of the
kids causing problems for everybody.''
   The policy was implemented April 16 and backed up by police foot
patrols scheduled for the assignment through this week. Private
security patrolled inside the mall.
   Metro Center Realvest, which owns the mall, said the policy will
remain in effect as long as it works.
   ``It's indefinite at this point,'' Metro Center vice president
Michael Wiese said.
   The March 30 incident was the most recent and most dramatic,
Wiese said, but the ``problem of youths congregating and causing
problems inside the mall has been ongoing for some time.''
   ``We have decided at this point that this is the most
appropriate way to restore order to the mall,'' Wiese said. ``We
have looked at what we feel are a number of legally permissible
options, and this is the one we decided to implement.''
   There are no apparent legal problems with the ParkFair curfew,
said Dick Shugrue, a law professor at Creighton University in Omaha.
   ``Age classifications need only be reasonable in a legal
setting. In a private setting, by and large, there isn't any
constitutional argument you could make,'' Shugrue said.
   ``The question boils down to whether it's a good business
decision.''

<HEAD>Bush: `I Don't Need Any Defense' for Lithuania Inaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, bitterly criticized by
Lithuania, said Wednesday ``I don't need any defense'' for refusing
to penalize the Soviet Union for its economic squeeze on the
breakaway Baltic republic.
   ``The policies, decisions I've taken have had strong support
from the American people, and that's who I work for,'' said Bush.
The president did not reply when asked by a reporter how
Lithuanians view his decision.
   While Bush has won support from some congressional leaders for
his strategy, there also were signs of restiveness Wednesday about
the lack of a U.S. response.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said Bush should take
some action ``to express disapproval and to deter further actions''
against Lithuania.
   He suggested slowdowns in U.S.-Soviet talks on the environment,
taxes, investment or trade but also said Bush was in the best
position to decide.
   For a second straight day, Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis denounced Bush's refusal to curb economic ties with the
Soviets in reaction to coercion of Lithuania.
   ``Our people remember how they were abandoned after World War II
... relegated to the Stalinist empire. It just saddens us to see
Western nations, especially the United States, being misled by the
Soviet Union,'' Landsbergis said in a telephone call with members
of Congress.
   ``The Soviets are strangling (our) nation like a boa
constrictor,'' he said, referring to the mounting pressure from
Moscow to force Lithuania to drop its drive to secede from the
Soviet Union.
   A day earlier, Landsbergis had charged ``This is another
Munich,'' when Bush delayed any economic sanctions.
   Landsbergis was invoking the infamous memory of French and
British appeasement of Nazi Germany that culminated in the 1938
Munich Pact sacrificing much of Czechoslovakia to Germany.
   The White House said it took no offense at Landsbergis' remark.
   ``No, we understand his frustrations and his efforts on behalf
of his people,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``Mr. Landsbergis is fully aware of the president's concern and
interest in freedom in his country,'' Fitzwater said.
   During a picture-taking ceremony at the White House, a reporter
questioned Bush about Landsbergis' ``Munich'' comment, asking how
he defended himself. ``I don't need any defense,'' Bush said,
adding that he enjoyed widespread support for his policies.
   On Capitol Hill, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a
Senate appropriations subcommittee that the Soviet Union must allow
Lithuanians to decide their own future.
   But Baker said the administration still was not prepared to levy
economic sanctions against Moscow to force negotiations with
Lithuanian leaders.
   ``We are involved in quiet diplomacy in an effort to promote
such a dialogue _ the only real answer to an effective resolution
of this conflict,'' Baker said.
   ``The Soviets are going to have to allow the Lithuanians to
fully exercise their rights of self-determination,'' Baker said.
   Fitzwater said, ``The president has reiterated time and again
our support for freedom of Lithuania and other countries of the
world. Indeed, preserving the fragile environment for freedom and
self-determination guides our policy.''
   The United States has never recognized the Soviet Union's
forcible annexation in 1940 of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. But
Bush has counseled restraint and dialogue since the Lithuanian
parliament declared its independence March 11.
   Bush has repeatedly cautioned the Kremlin against using force to
bring Lithuania into line, but he has also said the Baltic state
must recognize ``certain realities'' of its ties to the Soviet
Union.
   As Baker testified, Landsbergis told some members of Congress,
``It appears that the West doesn't want to help Lithuania. ... Our
reaction is one of discouragement and disappointment. It feels as
if our worst fears are being realized.''
   Late Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Committee inserted in a
supplemental spending bill a provision setting aside $10 million to
build and staff a U.S. embassy in Lithuania, should the United
States formally recognize the Baltic republic's independence.
   In criticism less restrained than Mitchell's, Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., issued a statement voicing ``mounting outrage and
frustration'' at the lack of a U.S. response to Moscow's moves. She
said, ``The Soviets have got to get a message from the free world:
You cannot keep your empire by the force of your guns.''

<TEXT>
   The leader of a white
supremacist group warned that his supporters will retaliate unless
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress calls off its guerrilla
campaign, a newspaper said Wednesday.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, head of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, also told The Citizen newspaper that white South Africans
would never accept a black government. He said President F.W. de
Klerk's government was headed for collapse and massive unrest.
   ``We will not allow our people to be murdered. It looks to me as
though the government is on the road to capitulation. We are not
prepared to live under an ANC government, which will mean chaos,''
TerreBlanche was quoted as saying.
   In other developments:
   _Two senior ANC leaders _ general secretary Alfred Nzo and
National Executive Commmittee member Joe Slovo _ were scheduled to
return Friday to South Africa after decades in exile, the ANC said.
Nzo and Slovo will be part of an 11-member ANC delegation to hold
talks May 2-4 with the de Klerk government.
   _ Police said two police officers and four protesters were
injured in clashes in various parts of the country when officers
used shotguns, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
demonstrators. Police, who gave few details, said 48 protesters
were arrested in various incidents.
   _ The new military rulers in the nominally independent Ciskei
homeland said they would grant amnesty to some prisoners in the
tribal reserve. No details were available. The military rulers,
sympathetic to the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups, came to
power last month in a coup that ousted a conservative,
authoritarian leader.
   De Klerk has expressed concern about right-wing white groups
that are arming themselves to oppose sharing power with the
nation's black majority.
   The talks in May are designed to clear the way for formal
negotiations on changing the constitution to give blacks a voice in
national affairs.
   TerreBlanche and other extremist leaders are forming a
``commando'' movement of armed followers to resist the end of
white-minority rule. His movement is thought to number a few
thousand.
   The ANC, the leading black political organization, has refused
to formally halt its armed struggle even though the guerrilla
campaign has been largely dormant for the past year.
   ``My message to ANC is that if it persists with its armed
struggle, we will meet it head on,'' TerreBlanche said in the
interview with The Citizen, which is pro-government.

   Dexter Gordon, revered by jazz fans as a
pioneering tenor saxophonist and known to filmgoers for his
Oscar-nominated performance in the 1986 movie ``Round Midnight,''
died today. He was 67.
   Gordon died at 12:50 a.m. of kidney failure, said Don Lucoff,
spokesman for Blue Note Records in New York. He said Gordon had
been in poor health and was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital in Philadelphia on March 18 for treatment of cancer of the
larynx.
   Nevertheless, Gordon recently had finished filming
``Awakenings,'' a movie with Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams.
   ``It's very, very difficult to even contemplate that we've lost
such a great master of his instrument and icredible human being,''
said guitarist George Benson. ``He was quite a man.''
   In the 1940s Gordon helped define the bebop style of jazz begun
by Lester Young, Charlie Parker and John Coltrane, and his playing
influenced future generations of musicians.
   Critics hailed his combination of Young's melodic approach with
the hard-driving sound and complex harmonics of Coleman Hawkins and
Parker.
   Gordon, born in Los Angeles, began his career with the big bands
of America, including those of Lionel Hampton, Louis Armstrong and
Billy Eckstine.
   He fell on hard times in the 1950s as bebop fell from favor and
served a two-year prison sentence in California. In 1962 he moved
to Paris and spent the next 14 years as part of the expatriate jazz
scene that inspired ``Round Midnight.''
   In 1960, he acted in a play, ``The Connection,'' and began a
series of albums on the Blue Note label that re-established his
reputation and brought his sound to a new generation of fans.
   The movie, about an aging, fading saxophonist in a Paris club
whose health and career are revived by a young French fan, was
largely based on the life of pianist Bud Powell, but had many
parallels with Gordon's life.
   Gordon _ raspy voiced, world-weary, his 6-foot-5 frame tottering
from the ravages of drugs and drink _ was a compelling figure in
the film, and he received widespread acclaim.
   It was the first time in Academy Award history that a musician
was nominated for the best-actor Oscar.
   He managed to record five albums for Blue Note between 1961-65,
the most outstanding ``Dexter Gordon'' with its cross section of
styles. ``Don't Explain demonstrated his moody range on ballads.
   Gordon's other records include ``Long Tall Dexter,'' ``Savoy:
Our Man in Paris,'' ``Go,'' ``Homecoming'' and ``Swinging Affair,''
``Dexter Gordon, Swiss Nights,'' ``True Blue,'' ``More Than You
Know,'' ``Dexter Quartet,'' ``I Found a New Baby,'' ``Long Tall
Dexter, 1946, The Chase, 1947, Doin' Alright, 1961, Dexter Calling,
A Swingin' Affair, One Flight Up, Our Man in Paris, 1963,
Homecoming, 1976.
   A memorial was planned for May 6 in New York, Lucoff said.

<HEAD>Air Force Eyes Peer Over Horizon With Radar System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new radar system that will allow military
observers to look over the Earth's horizon and get an earlier
warning of enemy aircraft or drug-smuggling planes has been turned
over to the Air Force.
   By being able to detect enemy aircraft farther away, the Air
Force gets as long as 3{ hours to respond to a threat of an attack,
compared with perhaps only a few minutes with conventional radar
systems, officials said.
   The $680 million Backscatter system turned over to the military
Tuesday gives the Air Force eyes over a semi-circular, 4.5
million-square-mile swath across the Atlantic from Greenland to
Cuba, the Air Force said.
   The operations center is based in the outskirts of this central
Maine city and the antennas are in Moscow _ Moscow, Maine, that is.
   The Maine system is the first of four that will eventually form
an early warning shield around most of North America's perimeter.
Its range of up to 1,800 miles is nearly 10 times greater than than
of conventional radar.
   While the over-the-horizon system was designed primarily to give
the Air Force more time to spot enemy bombers, it will also be
useful in detecting small planes carrying illegal narcotics, said
Col. John O. Lenz, the system's program director.
   Enemy cruise missiles, however, would be ``a very difficult
target ... perhaps the most difficult target for this type of
radar,'' Lenz said after the Air Force took possession of the
Bangor operations center from General Electric Co.
   The Air Force plans to hire private contractors to run the
operations center by mid-1992, although the most sensitive
decision-making roles _ such as whether to call for a military
response to an errant plane _ will remain in military hands. U.S.
and Canadian air force personnel are currently staffing the center.
   A bank of 16 computer systems collects the required flight plans
from all planes that enter the Backscatter system's range, telling
technicians whether aircraft represented by blips on their computer
screens belong in that airspace.
   ``If they don't have a flight plan, it enables the operator to
say, `I'd better take another look at this,''' said Capt. Alan M.
Chilton of the Canadian Air Force.
   The system gains its extraordinary reach by bouncing radar
signals off the Earth's ionosphere, enabling the radar to hopscotch
over the planet's curve. That layer of the atmosphere is also
responsible for bouncing shortwave radio signals around the world.
   The radar signal begins its journey from three, 3,600-foot-long
antenna arrays in the western Maine town of Moscow. Return signals
bouncing back from aircraft are picked up 100 miles away by three
receivers, each nearly a mile long, in the town of Columbia Falls.
   A similar over-the-horizon system with components in California,
Idaho and Oregon is 90 percent complete and is expected to come on
line in about a year. Its range will be a half donut-shaped area
across the Pacific from Alaska to south of Baja, Mexico.
   The planned central system, with components in North Dakota,
South Dakota and Minnesota, will focus on the southern part of the
continent. An Alaskan system will point toward the western part of
the Soviet Union.
   The system is not effective directly north of the continent
because of electrical disturbances in the atmosphere that produce
the northern lights. Conventional radar guards against intruders
from the north.

   The trial of a man accused of falsely
claiming that George Bush sought an arms-for-hostages deal from
Iranians 10 years ago was halted today after he was hospitalized
with chest pains.
   Richard Brenneke was in fair condition in St. Vincent Hospital &amp;
Medical Center, where he was taken Tuesday night, hours after
testimony in his trial got under way. He has a history of heart
problems.
   Brenneke claims then-vice presidential candidate Bush met in
Paris with Iranians a couple of weeks before the 1980 election in
hopes of freeing the Americans held in the Tehran embassy and
boosting Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign.
   Brenneke, 48, a Lake Oswego businessman, is charged in federal
court with one count of lying under oath and could face up to five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Rourke said in his opening
statement Tuesday that he would show that Brenneke lied when he
testified about the alleged meeting and when he said he and another
man were contract employees of the CIA.
   Brenneke's lawyer, Michael Scott, told the jury in his opening
statements that Reagan campaign officials ``were scared pea green
that President Jimmy Carter would succeed'' in winning freedom
before the presidential election for the Americans taken hostage in
Tehran in 1979.
   The Reagan administration years later sold arms to Iran as part
of a scheme that benefited the Nicaraguan Contras and resulted in
freedom for some hostages taken in Lebanon in the 1980s. But Reagan
has denied even that exchange was an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Brenneke, a reputed private arms dealer who also claims to have
knowledge of the Iran-Contra deal, made his disputed allegations
while testifying in September 1988 at the federal trial of Heinrich
Rupp, a Colorado gold dealer who was convicted of bank fraud.
   Brenneke claimed he and Rupp had both worked for the CIA and
that Rupp flew Bush; the late CIA director William Casey; and
Donald P. Gregg, now the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, to Paris
for the alleged meeting. Brenneke said it took place Oct. 19-20,
1980. At the time, Casey was Reagan's campaign chairman and Gregg
was a Bush adviser and National Security Council employee.
   At Tuesday's trial, Gregg and several other witnesses said the
people allegedly involved in the Paris meeting never left the
country at the time it was taking place.
   Gregg testified that he was vacationing with his wife and
daughter at a friend's house at Bethany Beach, Del., at the time
Brenneke claims the secret talks were held. Gregg showed snapshots
taken during the vacation and said it consisted mostly of ``seafood
dinners, swimming, tennis, reading and naps.''
   Brenneke's name surfaced from time to time during the
Iran-Contra affiar.
   He told The New York Times in November 1986, about the time the
affair first became public, that government sources told him early
that year that the Defense Department was planning to use profits
from the sale of arms to Iran to help the rebels in Nicaragua.
   Brenneke's name first surfaced publicly in February 1984 when an
advertisement appeared in a Central American newspaper, saying he
had arms for sale. He claimed at the time that he had never
authorized or placed the ad.

<DATELINE>ALON, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel broke ground for a new
Jewish settlement Wednesday in the Judean Desert, where bulldozers
pushed aside rocks and a crane hoisted seven mobile homes into the
clearing on a hilltop.
   Also Wednesday, officials said Attorney General Yosef Harish's
office filed a brief with the Supreme Court urging the immediate
eviction of 150 Jewish settlers from the Christian Arab quarter in
Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   Enlisting the support of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek and Police
Commander Rahamim Comfort, the attorney general argued that the
continued presence of Jewish settlers could provoke violence.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule Thursday on appeals by the
settlers to set aside lower court rulings ordering their eviction
from a 72-room complex owned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate.
   Settlement activity has stepped up significantly since March 15,
when hard-line Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took the reins of a
caretaker government. Previously, the center-left Labor Party had
acted as a brake on settlements, but the Labor-Likud coalition
collapsed March 15.
   The settlement campaign has had far-reaching repercussions,
straining Israel's relations with the United States and endangering
a $400 million housing loan request for Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   It has brought protests from American Jewish groups and even
cast a shadow over the fate of Western hostages held in Lebanon by
Shiite Moslem groups.
   In Alon, Jewish settlers raised glasses in a toast and watched
as bulldozers smoothed the rocky ground for the mobile homes.
   ``In five years, there will be a big city here,'' settler leader
Eliyakim Haetzni said, gesturing toward the barren hills
surrounding Alon. It is halfway between Jerusalem and the biblical
town of Jericho in the Jordan Valley.
   Another settler leader, Moshe Waysman, said 10 families and a
few bachelors would move into Alon on Wednesday and that six more
mobile homes would be added in the next few days.
   ``We want to live together in a pleasant environment, to have
some land around our houses and to have a higher standard of
living,'' Waysman said.
   The coalition agreement of the former Likud-Labor government
called for eight new settlements to be built by 1992, but it did
not include Alon.
   However, Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner insisted the construction
did not violate the agreement, saying Alon is merely an expansion
of the settlement of Kfar Adumim. But the sites are a mile apart,
and no road connects them.
   Left-wing legislators, including Dedi Zucker of the Citizens
Rights Movement, accused Shamir of exploiting the period of
political uncertainty to push through settlement plans.
   In the past two weeks, the government has authorized
construction of the Dugit settlement in the occupied Gaza Strip,
and reportedly allowed preparation of four more settlements that
were stalled while Labor was in the ruling coalition.
   In Jerusalem, the police commander warned that continued
presence of the settlers in the Christian Arab quarter of the Old
City in the face of court-ordered eviction ``may in itself be an
inciting factor in this sensitive area.''
   ``Every event in the area has influence on the fabric of
relations, problematic these days, between members of different
religions and faiths,'' Comfort said, according to an official who
read portions of the document to The Associated Press. The document
was filed with the attorney general's brief.
   The Old City is on land captured from Jordan during the 1967
Middle East war. It is divided into separate districts for Moslems,
Jews and Christians.
   The settlers moved into St. John's Hospice April 11, claiming
they had subleased the four-building complex from an Armenian
Christian tenant.
   The Greek Orthodox Church says the lease is illegal. The church
has been supported by two lower courts in its efforts to evict the
settlers.

   Representatives of California State
University-Hayward who invited an artist to show her work on campus
had no idea she had switched from painting plants to nudes.
   Audrey Yuen, who has exhibited her work on campus before,
planned a three-week show in May at the University Union _ until
officials discovered the change.
   Three paintings of fully nude women were in Yuen's proposed
10-nude exhibit. But the student union had never shown nude
pictures before, much less full-frontal nudes.
   ``To me, it's art,'' the Oakland artist said. ``It's not
anything lewd or lascivious.''
   ``When they started saying, `We don't want anything below the
waist,' it really took me aback,'' she said. ``They wanted me to
cover them up. What do you do? Paste something on top? Put little
black strips over them?''
   In a last-minute compromise, Yuen and student union directors
agreed Tuesday to an all-nude show featuring only above-the-waist
nudes.
   University spokesman John Caine defended the compromise, saying
the third-floor wall of the student union where Yuen's work will
hang ``is not an art gallery by any means.''

   Riot police broke up a demonstration
Wednesday by striking nurses who gathered outside the health
ministry to press their demands for better wages and working
conditions.
   Several nurses were taken by truck to the central police station
in downtown Harare for a talk with police officials, said a police
spokesman.
   The spokesman, who by custom was not identified, denied any of
the nurses had been arrested. He said that they had been removed
from the health ministry so they could be advised about the
legality of their actions.
   It is illegal for Zimbabweans employed in essential services to
strike. Police authorization is routinely required for protests.
   Junior nurses have been staging a series of work stoppages since
April 8, demanding better wages and working conditions.
   The ministry of health offered unspecified pay increases April
21, but most nurses vowed not to resume work until the raises were
confirmed in writing.
   On Tuesday, armed riot police with dogs forced hundreds of
striking nurses off the grounds of hospitals and clinics in
Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city.
   Church officials appealed to the nurses Wednesday to return to
work. The call came after mission workers in northeastern Zimbabwe
blamed the nurses' action for the death of a man wounded by
Mozambique rebels in a cross-border attack.
   The man allegedly bled to death after being turned away by
nurses at a provincial hospital 55 miles northeast of Harare, the
capital.
   Health authorities have disputed the allegations, saying the
wounded man was treated by doctors at Bindura hospital and could
not have been saved.
   Last year, scores of doctors were arrested for striking over
poor pay and working conditions. They were jailed briefly under
state of emergency laws.

<HEAD>Mobutuo Names Former Professor To Head Transitional Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mobutu Sese Seko named a former
professor Wednesday to head a transitional government that will
oversee this central African country's move to a multiparty
democracy, government sources said.
   The announcement came one day after Mobutu declared that he was
lifting a 20-year ban on opposition parties and ending his ruling
party's monopoly on power.
   Mobutu has wielded nearly absolute power since taking over in
November 1965. He said the constitution would be rewritten and a
transitional government set up to run the country until democratic
elections are held within a year.
   On Wednesday, Mobutu appointed Lunda Bululu, secretary-general
of the Economic Community of Central African States, as prime
minister of the transitional government, said the government
sources.
   The former professor will oversee the political transition as
well as efforts to depoliticize the military, police and other key
government branches.
   Mobutu has come under strong pressure at home and abroad to
introduce democratic reforms. In January, he began a personal tour
of the country, saying he wanted to determine support for his
government.
   During the tour, many individuals and groups criticized his
regime, saying it had allowed widespread corruption and
impoverished the country. Opponents also accused the government of
repressing dissent.
   Mobutu had repeatedly ruled out a multiparty system in the past.
For almost 20 years, Zaireans were required to be members of the
ruling Popular Movement for the Revolution party.

   The French airline Air Inter announced Wednesday it
is banning smoking on all domestic flights after a two-month
experiment found that 88 percent of passengers favored smoke-free
flights.
   The carrier banned smoking as a temporary measure March 1. The
announcement Wednesday said the restriction will be extended
indefinitely due to the results of the survey conducted among
passengers.
   The airline reported a poll of 5,500 passengers showed that 88
percent thought smoke-free flights were a good policy, with 96
percent of non-smokers and 72 percent of smokers favoring such a
ban.
   About 36 percent of the airline's passengers smoke, the company
said. Air Inter primarily serves domestic routes but has some
flights to Rome, Lisbon and London.

   Census workers turn to door-to-door counting
Thursday with the bureau facing escalating costs and criticism of
its efforts so far this year.
   Only 63 percent of the nation's households have responded by
mail, leaving the census takers the task of driving, riding and
walking to the remainder of homes.
   Original plans had anticipated a 70 percent response, and the
shortfall could help add $150 million or more to the projected $1.3
billion cost of the 1990 census.
   The work beginning Thursday covers more than 100 metropolitan
areas across the nation, as counters try to track down folks who
either didn't get a census form or failed to mail theirs back.
   Individual counting expands to an additional 300 smaller
communities May 3, Census officials report.
   In rural areas, which were not included in the mail portion of
the count, personal visits by census takers have been going on
since March.
   The national head count began in March with the mailing of more
than 95 million census forms.
   The official counters can be identified by their red, white and
blue identification badges and satchels, the bureau reported.
   Although the house-to-house count is now starting, government
officials continue to encourage Americans to mail back forms if
they have not done so.
   Counting Americans at home will continue at least through June,
officials report, longer if needed.
   Members of Congress have been highly critical of the early
census effort, noting that large areas of some big cities have been
overlooked in the mail count.
   In addition, a coalition of cities and interest groups has filed
suit against the bureau, contending that minorities are being
undercounted and seeking to force a statistical adjustment of the
final census figures.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity ended its national congress
Wednesday after an all-night session attended by chairman Lech
Walesa, who said the union now is united to face Poland's problems.
   ``Now we have the mandate. We are organized for when life brings
its problems,'' said a proud Walesa from the rostrum as the
congress ended at 8 a.m.
   The seven-day congress, the trade union's second, re-elected
Walesa as chairman. It also approved a new charter and program and
chose a 96-member national commission, ending long-simmering
disputes about the legitimacy of Solidarity's leadership structure
after the chaos caused by martial law in 1981.
   The new program calls for Solidarity to concentrate mainly on
trade union issues while not withdrawing totally from its role as a
broad political movement. The union retains the option to create
its own political party if it sees the need.
   ``The solutions are not perfect, but in the present situation,
perfect solutions do not exist,'' Walesa said.
   ``The essence of the congress was, when a chance lies ahead for
the country, to be united and organized. As a practical person, I
am happy about this,'' he said.
   The congress gave an overwhelming vote of confidence to Walesa's
leadership since the union's first congress in October 1981. He has
guided the union from its years as an underground organization
through the long negotiations that led to its regaining legal
status a year ago.
   The same negotiations opened the door to a Solidarity-led
government for Poland, which led the wave of reform in the East
bloc.
   ``The position of Walesa is now really indisputable,'' said one
Warsaw delegate, Marcin Przybylowicz.
   Still, Walesa did come under criticism for his authoritarian
style of leadership during the debates. In closing remarks, he
appeared to be trying to make amends.
   ``This congress brought a few surprises. It did not go exactly
along with my concept. But I never took the floor _ even though my
tongue was jumping out _because I did not want to disturb
democracy,'' he said.
   Many delegates emerged from the meeting convinced Walesa is
planning a bid for Poland's presidency, using the union as a base.
   Walesa has been evasive in discussing his presidential plans.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski's term ends in 1995. The congress,
however, passed a resolution calling for new parliamentary and
presidential elections by the spring of 1991.
   ``He is citizen No. 1 in this country, and if the alternative is
Jaruzelski, of course it is great'' if he runs, said delegate Jan
Waszkiewicz of Walesa.
   But other union members appeared disappointed at the prospect.
   ``Myself and others would feel cheated if he ran for the
chairman of the union with the intention of becoming president,''
said Alojzy Pietrzyk, the miners' leader for the region of Silesia.
   Walesa and the new national commission were elected to serve a
three-year term, and the next national solidarity congress is to be
held in one year.
   The congress took place in a calm atmosphere that contrasted
sharply with its last stormy 18-day meeting in 1981. That took
place under a barrage of hostile criticism from Communist
authorities in Warsaw, Moscow and other East bloc capitals.
   In 1981, crowds gathered outside the Oliva Sports Hall to be
close to the debates. There were no similar displays of enthusiasm
this time, with life in Gdansk proceeding normally.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Deputy Prime Minister
Leszek Balcerowicz, architect of Poland's stringent economic reform
program, made appearances at the congress.
   But relations between Solidarity and the government it helped

<HEAD>Bush Calls Again For Line-Item Veto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush appealed anew Wednesday for a
line-item veto and broader power to rescind funds Congress has
appropriated.
   ``The president needs the power to make the tough calls on
spending, take the heat _ and I'm perfectly prepared to do that,''
said Bush, also urging that the Constitution be amended to require
a balanced budget.
   He said seven of his predecessors had requested line-item veto
authority, which Congress refused to grant. A total of 43 governors
already possess such power.
   The government this year is running a deficit of $150 billion;
Bush has proposed a $63 billion deficit for next year's budget.
   Bush was surrounded by Republican lawmakers, Cabinet officers
and budget chief Richard Darman during a brief White House ceremony
at which as he signed messages sending his proposed changes to
Capitol Hill.
   His three-part strategy entails:
   _A proposed constitutional amendment giving the president
line-item veto authority.
   _Support for a Legislative Line Item Veto Act, which would widen
his power to rescind funds already appropriated by Congress.
   _Endorsement of the balanced budget amendment introduced by Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Under current law, a president can only veto an entire piece of
legislation. The president cannot excise particular expenditures
the White House finds objectionable.
   Bush said he needs a way to avoid ``unnecessary expenditures ...
without sacrificing entire legislative enactments.''
   The Legislative Line Item Veto Act would strengthen the
president's hand in rescinding funds already appropriated by
Congress.
   ``Congress can reject a presidential rescission simply by
inaction,'' Bush said, noting a 1974 recission law. ``And that's
precisely what's happened to the vast majority of rescission
proposals.
   ``I ask Congress to require an up or down vote on presidential
rescissions.''

<HEAD>Social Worker Acquitted in Failing to Report Suspected Abuse</HEAD>

   Jurors on Wednesday acquitted a state
child-protection worker of failing to report suspected abuse before
the death of a toddler who allegedly had been dunked in a toilet
for soiling his pants.
   Shirley Duboise, a former foster care counselor, was among four
state Health and Rehabilitative Services workers charged in the
July 28 death of 2-year-old Bradley McGee.
   Despite complaints from the boy's foster parents, Bradley was
returned to his biological parents, Thomas and Sheryl Coe of
Lakeland, two months before he died. He had been submerged
repeatedly in a toilet, authorities said.
   Never before have Florida child-care workers been charged over
their handling of a case. With Wednesday's verdict, two have been
acquitted at trial, charges were dropped against one, and the
fourth is awaiting trial.
   The three-day trial that ended Wednesday boiled down to a battle
of credibility between the 43-year-old defendant and foster mother
Pam Kirkland. Bradley was abandoned as an infant and in foster care
most of his life, but was sent periodically to his parents for
visits.
   Mrs. Kirkland testified that Bradley came home from one visit
emotionally upset with a cuts on his hand, a cigarette burn and a
red mark behind his ear. She said her complaints were ignored.
   Ms. Duboise testified that the last time she saw the boy, April
26, 1989, she didn't suspect abuse.
   ``Bradley had a little sore on his hand and a little sore, a
splinter or something of that kind, on the tip of his little
finger,'' Ms. Duboise testified. ``I had no reason to believe
Bradley had been abused either through his behavior or his physical
condition.''
   After the verdict, Ms. Duboise criticized the prosecutors,
saying they had not fully investigated the case. She had rejected a
plea bargain on the misdemeanor that was punishable by 60 days in
jail. Ms. Duboise resigned her post shortly after the boy died.
   Bradley's parents were charged with first-degree murder in the
case. Mrs. Coe was sentenced last week to 30 years in prison after
pleading guilty to a charge of second-degree murder. Coe's trial is
scheduled for July.

<HEAD>Subcommittee OKs Legislation to Allow Food Giveaways</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Agriculture subcommittee Wednesday
approved a foreign trade section of the 1990 farm bill that would
allow food giveaways to needy countries.
   The legislation is similar to the Senate measure on foreign
trade approved in committee earlier this month. The farm bill will
set agriculture policy for the next five years.
   The major difference between the two bills is the way the food
aid programs would be managed within the government, according to a
House subcommittee spokeswoman.
   Both bills would allow the president to give food to countries
whose governments he wants to encourage, such as those in Eastern
Europe. Such assistance now must be in the form of a sale.
   The bills also allow the United States to forgive the debts of
financially strapped countries trying to restructure their
economies.
   Both the House and the Senate followed Bush administration
recommendations in writing their bills.
   Ann Veneman, deputy undersecretary for international affairs and
commodity programs, said the chief difference the administration
has with either bill is in the language dealing with the Export
Enhancement Program.
   The program offers exporters bonuses for sales of certain
products to particular countries and is used to reduce the cost of
U.S. goods in the international marketplace.
   The Senate bill says the Agriculture Department must spend at
least $900 million in fiscal 1991 on the program; the House version
requires that $500 million be spent.
   The administration does not want any specific dollar amount
named.
   ``It's a trade-policy tool,'' Veneman said, adding that the
amount spent should be the prerogative of the administration.

   The female majority on the Sacramento
City Council is inspiring sensitivity to feminist issues _ and so
the city's Public Works Department is seeking a synonym for
``manhole.''
   Among early candidates: ``person-access chamber,'' plus a few
entries involving risque or humorous acronymns.
   The manager of the department's engineering division, Thomas M.
Finley, said Tuesday that the staff decided to seek the change
after seeing Mayor Anne Rudin circle ``manhole'' on reports, and
hearing her comments.
   Rudin praised the staff Tuesday for ``keeping up with
contemporary standards.'' But Finley admitted: ``Honestly, I don't
know if we'll come up with anything of value.''
   Civil engineers Randy Witt and Shawn O'Brien jokingly suggested
a ``Manhole Terminology Change Contest.'' Finley quickly put them
in charge of organizing one.
   Witt and O'Brien set a May 4 deadline for entries and a May 9
announcement of winners.
   The prizes? First, a 40-mile all-expenses-paid trip to the
foundry to see the new name cast in a cover plate. Second, a
rubbing of a new cover plate. Third, the responsibility for
changing all references to manhole in the city books.

   Feathers will fly again Thursday as a
judge wrestles with the age-old question _ which came first, the
chicken or the law?
   Village Attorney Walter Ward has filed a civil suit in the
continuing legal effort to force David and Lynda Ashley to stop
harboring poultry. The Ashleys say the 17 cluckers are pets with
names like Goobette and Nippy.
   Ward is asking a state judge for authority to remove the
chickens from the Ashley property immediately pending a trial on
the merits of the case. The request will be heard Thursday at the
county courthouse in Waterloo.
   The case gained widespread attention after the Ashleys refused
to obey a village ordinance against the keeping of livestock and
poultry. Each served 10 days of 15-day jail sentences imposed by a
village justice.
   The Ashleys have argued that they have a right to keep pet
chickens as much as other people keep dogs and cats.

   A real estate consultant said he
paid for a billboard that states ``Desperately seeking Donald Trump

yielded no results.
   Bill Riddles, 38, posted the ad on a billboard on a city street
last week. He moved here in January from Massachusetts, seeking a
piece of the booming south Florida market.
   The $375-a-week billboard has prompted unusual phone calls,
according to operators at Ding-A-Ling Answering Service, which
answers the number on the billboard.
   The messages have ranged from ``This sign is horrible'' to ``We
have an opening for a receptionist if you're interested,'' an
operator said.
   One phony caller identified himself as ``the Donald'' and
requested that Riddles call him in New York but didn't leave a
number. Riddles said it was obvious the call was a fake.
   ``This is not a frivolous attempt at getting a job,'' he said.
``It is part of an overall strategy. But, the jury is still out as
to whether this is an effective way to get a job.''

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Predicts a Silent Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese Premier Li Peng, whose hard-line
government cracked down on protesters clamoring for democracy one
year ago, said Wednesday he is sure that this spring will be silent.
   Speaking at a news conference during the first visit to the
Soviet Union by a Chinese head of government in 26 years, Li also
acknowledged the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But he said
it was ``too early to say'' whether those nations would abandon
socialism.
   He termed his Moscow visit a success because both nations agreed
to reduce military forces along their common border and continue
``good-neighborly, friendly relations,'' although there was a hint
the two longtime Communist rivals could not reach a complete
agreement.
   A year ago this month, protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square
set off a push for democracy that led to demonstrations across
China. The protests overshadowed the visit to Beijing by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a visit that ended three decades of
strained relations.
   ``Some believe that in April, May or June of this year, more
disturbances will affect China, but I am sure that nothing of that
sort will happen,'' Li said.
   The army killed hundreds of protesters on June 3-4 in Beijing.
China has since arrested thousands of dissenters and tightened
controls on society.
   ``Last year, this time around, I concentrated on handling these
very delicate issues,'' he said. ``Now I am on an official visit to
the Soviet Union, which means that the political situation in our
country is stable.''
   Asked whether China's handling of the demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square could be a model for Gorbachev in his confrontation with the
breakaway Baltic republic of Lithuania, Li refused to answer.
   ``I think this question was directed to the wrong address. It's
of him (Gorbachev) that you should ask such questions,'' he said.
   Responding to another question, Li did acknowledge ``minor
unrest'' in the western province of Xinjiang, Beijing's first
admission of the incident. Regional television has reported 22
people were killed in rioting April 5-6 in the town of Akto, saying
it was caused by Moslems trying to start a holy war.
   Li did not give a casualty toll but said the ``situation has
stabilized.''
   He said he expects China to maintain relations with the
countries in Eastern Europe, ``whether they will abandon socialism
or whether they will uphold the principles of socialism.''
   Yet in a sign that China and the Soviet Union could not resolve
all their differences during the summit meeting, Li said there
would be no customary joint communique.
   No such statement would be issued, Li said, because his four-day
visit was so short and ``more time and effort would be needed'' to
work out a communique. He said that each side's concluding
statement Thursday would have ``no radical differences.''
   Li said China agreed to grant state credits to the Soviet Union
to buy $333 million worth of Chinese consumer goods, such as
textiles and other, unspecified light industry products. The Soviet
Union suffers from chronic shortages of basic consumer goods.
   The Soviet Union will provide a credit to China to build two
nuclear power stations that will generate 1 million megawatts each,
he said.
   The 61-year-old premier, who studied engineering in Moscow from
1948 to 1954, said the two nations had economies that
``complemented one another'' and enabled them to reach the
agreements.
   The military agreement provides for the mutual reduction of
armed forces and military confidence-building measures along the
two countries' 4,350-mile border. The nations have been negotiating
the troop reductions for years.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel on
Wednesday briefed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on a meeting he had
with the leader of the PLO and offered his help in mediating
between Israel and the Palestinians.
   Shamir, who opposes any dealings with the PLO, did not appear to
take Havel up on his offer.
   Havel, who on his arrival earlier Wednesday became the first
Eastern European leader to visit the Jewish state, met with PLO
chief Yasser Arafat in Prague this month.
   ``(Havel) said he has a great interest in this conflict and
would like to help. But he knows it is complicated. We did not
discuss any specific steps that could be taken by Czechoslovakia in
this respect,'' Shamir told reporters.
   Havel ``told me briefly about his meeting with Arafat,'' Shamir
said. He refused to elaborate.
   Havel, 54, a playwright and former dissident, was quoted by the
Hebrew daily Haaretz as saying Arafat assured him that the
Palestine Liberation Organization wants Israel to adopt U.S.
proposals for starting a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
   Arafat ``stressed repeatedly that he attaches great hopes to my
peace mission,'' Havel said, but added he could not vouch for
Arafat's sincerity.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said no dialogue was possible
with Arafat, either directly or through intermediarie.
   ``What Arafat wants is the disappearance of Israel. Therefore,
we don't want to have any dialogue with Mr. Arafat, not direct or
indirect,'' Pazner told The Associated Press.
   Referring to Havel, he added, ``Even if our friend has the best
of intentions, we will not take him up on that.''
   Havel also met with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Shimon
Peres, head of the center-left Labor Party. Labor, which supports
the U.S. peace proposals, is trying to form a new government.
   Shamir indicated he asked the Czechoslovak leader to allow
Prague to serve as a transit point for flights of Soviet Jewish
immigrants bound for Israel.
   ``We discussed our interest in the help from Czechoslovakia in
the efforts to resolve the questions ... of the immigration of
Jewish people from the Soviet Union to Israel,'' Shamir said
without elaboration.
   Yosef Govrin, a senior Israeli foreign ministry official, said
talks are under way on air connections and that flights could start
by summer.
   Czechoslovakia has said it has been unable to serve as a transit
point because it was unable to provide the necessary security. Arab
militants have threatened to disrupt flights through East Europe to
block the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European states, with the
exception of Romania, followed the Kremlin's lead in cutting ties
with Israel after the 1967 Middle East war, in which Israel seized
land from Moscow's Arab allies.
   But Israel now has full diplomatic ties with Romania, Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia as well as low-level ties with the
Soviet Union. Negotiations are under way with East Germany and
Bulgaria.

<HEAD>Would-Be Congressman Told Tall Tale To Get Lukens' Campaign Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An underdog Democrat told a tall tale to get
campaign advice from the Ohio congressman he wants to replace, and
now he's hoping to pick up votes by revealing the ruse.
   Ricky Lee Mattox, 28, admits he posed as an inquisitive college
student to get Republican Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens to offer an
insider's insights on running for Congress.
   ``He confided in me tactics about his first and second campaigns
that I thought were brilliant,'' the political neophyte said.
   With just two weeks to go before Ohio's primary elections,
Mattox said he decided to come clean about the scheme because he
felt guilty _ and to attract attention to his low-budget candidacy.
   The subterfuge occurred in February, when Lukens agreed to meet
the undercover Mattox for breakfast to discuss wining campaign
strategies.
   ``I came out of the meeting with a lot of respect for him,''
Mattox said. ``I've never met anyone with as much political
knowledge.''
   Lukens, who is fighting for his political life after his May
1989 conviction for having sex with a teen-age girl, remembered the
tutorial with the 28-year-old.
   ``He seemed receptive. He seemed like a nice guy,'' the
incumbent said.
   ``I am a little surprised that Ricky would go to that extent,''
Lukens said. ``If he had just told me he was Ricky Mattox I would
have given the same advice.''
   Mattox wasn't the first candidate to seek his advice, Lukens
said. The congressman said he's advised seven or eight candidates
over the past year. And in 1986, the eventual Democratic nominee
for Lukens' seat went to Lukens before the primary seeking advice,
the congressman said.
   ``It happens more often than you think,'' he said.
   Mattox, who is making his first bid for elective office,
maintained he had nowhere else to turn as a Democratic candidate in
a district that had sent Republicans to Congress for a generation.
   ``I wasn't receiving any advice from the Democratic Party
here,'' he said.
   ``I wanted advice on campaigning. And Buz Lukens, even though
people despise him, he's a very good politician.''
   As it turned out, Mattox ignored much of what Lukens told him.
   But Lukens appears to be taking his own advice as he awaits the
outcome of his appeal of a misdemeanor conviction for contributing
to the unruliness of a minor.
   Lukens has been visible in his district, making the rounds of
service-club breakfasts, farm group meetings and other small
gatherings. His mother, Edith, maintains a similar schedule.
   While in the district, Lukens said, ``We try to average 22 to 27
events a day.'' As for his mother, ``She sometimes has 20 events
herself.''
   Lukens has steered clear of Republican meetings and candidate
forums, since his official stance is that he's waiting for the 10th
Ohio District Court of Appeals to rule on his appeal.
   Mattox made one other pre-primary confession, saying he has been
deliberately misleading about the temporary, part-time job he took
to make ends meet during the campaign.
   The former Navy missile technician, a structural engineer by
training, routinely describes himself as a database operator for
Essenza Corp. He works for an Essenza subsidiary, SDS Pizza,
punching ordering information and bad-check records into the
pizzeria's computers for $4 an hour.

   Soviets and Americans met again by
the river Elbe on Wednesday, marveling at the imminent unity of
Germany exactly 45 years after they helped cut it in two.
   Under gray skies and a light drizzle, about 100 World War II
veterans watched a solemn ceremony as a wreath was laid in the
grassy river delta where the armies of two invading nations came
together.
   Soviet and U.S. veterans wearing medals from the historic
military campaign clasped hands, embraced and traded war stories in
the first Elbe reunion held on free German soil.
   Both armies invaded Torgau as they drove through Germany from
opposite ends, formally linking up April 25, 1945.
   William Robertson, 66, was credited with leading one of two U.S.
Army scout patrols that made the first contact with the Soviet
forces.
   ``To us veterans it's a very big deal, but it probably isn't to
most Americans,'' said the retired physician from Culver City,
Calif.
   ``But the Elbe meeting touches something very deep in the hearts
of the Soviets,'' he added.
   The last such reunion was in 1985 and drew about 25,000 people.
It was orchestrated by the Soviets and the then-Communist East
German government. The United States criticized it as a propaganda
extravaganza.
   The gathering Wednesday was more low-key and attracted a crowd
of only about 2,000 people to the river bank on the edge of this
aging town 75 miles southeast of Berlin.
   Veterans marveled at the peaceful revolt that ousted East
Germany's hard-line government. The popular uprising opened the way
for democratic government and eventual unification with West
Germany.
   The reunion Wednesday was planned in June 1989, when such events
were unthinkable.
   ``It's very confusing for some of us older people. There has
been a lot going on,'' said Soviet veteran Nikolai Sagoruko, 76, a
former member of a Soviet mine-sweeping force. ``But we think good
things are happening and hope it means peace.''
   Soviets turned out in their green Red Army uniforms, their
chests packed with medals and one little U.S. flag. Americans wore
baseball caps and blue-and-white jackets.
   Two small American scout troops made contact with two small
Soviet patrols along the river on that historic day in 1945, but it
was the group Robertson led that set up the meeting of commanders
from the two armies.
   ``The others were first, but we got the glory, the newspaper
clippings,'' said Robertson. ``They had communications problems and
nobody knew they made contact until the next day.''
   Retired Lt. Gen. Vladimir Orloe, leader of the Soviet veterans
contingent, said conflicting claims also existed between the two
Soviet patrols about which was the first to make contact.
   Ivan Krutcheno, 72, said he was part of the first group of
Soviet scouts.
   ``We came here and saw Americans and we thought we were in
America, we had traveled for so long,'' he said.
   The veterans gathered at a cemetery to lay a wreath at the
graves of Soviet soldiers killed in Torgau. They later placed a
wreath on the grave of Joseph Polowsky, an American soldier who won
unusual acclaim in the Soviet Union with his efforts to arrange the
periodic Torgau reunions.
   Polowsky, a New York City cab driver who died in 1983, insisted
he be buried at Torgau.
   ``He just thought it was so beautiful here,'' said Bill Beswick,
65, of West Point, Va., who was a pallbearer at Polowsky's funeral
and one of the first soldiers to reach the Elbe.
   Leonard Addorisio, 66, of Hartford, Conn., said he was amazed at
the camaraderie shown by the Soviet veterans.
   ``Everyone is so good, so friendly, you wonder why there are
wars,'' he said.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister: France Still Honors Embargo Against Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France will continue to honor sanctions imposed by
the European Economic Community against Libya in 1986, despite
Libya's role in the freeing of a French hostage, Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas said Wednesday.
   ``The decisions of the EEC are respected and applied,'' Dumas
said in response to questions in the National Assembly. ``France is
waiting for new decisions to be taken ... before changing its
stance.''
   The EEC imposed a range of sanctions in 1986, citing Libyan
backing for terrorist groups.
   Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, Fernand Houtekins of Belgium and
their daughter, Sophie-Liberte, were freed in Beirut on April 10 by
members of Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a radical Palestinian group
led by Abu Nidal. The group is backed by Libya.
   France has ``no official contact with the hostage-takers'' and
engaged in ``state-to-state negotiations'' in order to obtain the
hostages' release, Dumas said.
   There was widespread criticism in the Western media when Dumas
praised Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, for a
``humanitarian'' gesture in pushing for the hostages' release. Some
French newspapers have asserted that the hostages in fact were
seized by Libyan forces and only later turned over to Abu Nidal's
group.
   Dumas rejected as hypocritical the accusations that France is
being too conciliatory toward Libya. He asserted that 5,000 Britons
were working in Libya's petrochemical industry and said West
Germany, Italy, Japan and South Korea all had more economic ties
with Libya than France had.
   Dumas for the first time gave a chronological summary of the
contacts that led to the hostages' release.
   He said the French government in July 1988 asked Morocco's King
Hassan II to confer with Gadhafi about the hostages. This led to a
meeting in Morocco between French and Libyan representatives.
   Dumas said France also obtained help from President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, who discussed the matter with Gadhafi in February.
   On April 4, Gadhafi publicly appealed for the release of Ms.
Valente and her family.
   French officials have denied any connection between the
hostages' release and France's decision in March to allow the
delivery of three French-made warplanes to Libya after a four-year
embargo. Libya had purchased the planes previously, but they were
back in France for repairs when French officials decided to block
their return.

   In a Superior Court suit filed Tuesday, Todd Champion and
Stephen Santosusso say they had been assured they wouldn't get hurt.
   The suit claims that pro boxer Tommy Morrison broke Santosusso's
jaw during filming March 14. The next day, Champion stepped in and
suffered a fractured right eye socket, the suit says.
   Defendants named in the suit include ``Rocky'' star Stallone,
Morrison, director John Avildsen and producers Irwin Winkler and
Robert Chartoff.
   It seeks unspecified general and punitive damages and
reimbursement for medical expenses.
   Dave Fulton, the publicist for ``Rocky V,'' said Wednesday the
defendants had not yet been served papers and would have no comment.

<HEAD>FDA to Consider Home AIDS Tests</HEAD>

   The Food and Drug Administration will
reconsider its long-standing opposition to home AIDS test kits,
officials said Wednesday.
   ``Some people say it would encourage more people to be tested
for AIDS, and if they (test) positive and got into the medical
system they could get early treatment,'' said Dr. Paul Parkman,
director of the FDA's center for biologics evaluation and research.
   ``I'm not sure all that will happen, but that's how we want to
evaluate the system.''
   FDA officials said they were persuaded to rethink their
opposition because of medical advances in treatment, such as use of
AZT to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages.
   Parkman said the FDA still has concerns about the home kits,
which would enable people to send a small blood sample to a
laboratory and get the results by telephone.
   ``It's not a sure thing. This is not tantamount to saying the
FDA is going to approve this,'' Parkman said.
   ``We're still being cautious. We think it's an area that can be
studied to see if the risks outweigh the benefits and whether the
product can be used effectively.''
   Also Wednesday, the FDA licensed the first test kit that detects
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 2, or HIV-2, a
second but rare cause of AIDS.
   Only 17 cases of HIV-2 infection have been reported in the
United States; most HIV-2 infections have occurred in West Africa
and Central Africa.
   The virus is spread the same way as HIV-1 _ primarily through
sexual contact with an infected partner, sharing needles with an
infected IV drug user and contaminated blood and blood products.
   Parkman said the FDA isn't requiring blood banks to use the
HIV-2 test now because the virus isn't considered a threat to the
U.S. blood supply. Blood banks screen blood for HIV-1 antibodies
and don't accept blood from immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa.
   An FDA advisory committee last week recommended the agency lift
its ban on blood donations from black African immigrants if a blood
bank tests for HIV-2 as well as HIV-1.
   Parkman said the FDA has accepted one application for a home
AIDS test kit, from University Hospital Laboratories Corp. in
Bethesda, Md. However, he said a lawsuit filed by the company last
month seeking to force the FDA to accept its application had no
effect on the decision.
   The lawsuit was settled April 10, said Elliott Millenson,
president of University Hospital Laboratories, which filed its FDA
application in December 1987.
   ``I think our lawsuit forced the FDA to re-examine the issue,
but I'm delighted with the decison,'' he said.
   The FDA has sent letters about the policy change to about 30
other companies that are developing test kits or have expressed
interest in doing so, Parkman said.
   Until now, the FDA has refused to accept home test kit
applications because of technical concerns, such as how well people
could be instructed with written material to draw their own blood
and whether samples could be shipped safely through the mail.
   The agency also worried about how people using the tests would
be counseled about the disease.
   One technical innovation that has eased FDA officials' minds
about home testing is a process by which a small amount of blood
drawn with a finger prick can be stored on a sheet of filter paper
and sent to a laboratory.

   Discovery's astronauts overcame
balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free
from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the
universe.
   The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3
minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere,
which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.
   ``Discovery, go for Hubble release,'' Mission Control told the
crew at 3:37 p.m. EDT. The event occurred a minute later as the
shuttle slowly and carefully backed away.
   The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground
controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels
that power the telescope's instruments.
   The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its
reel. Mission Control ordered space-walking astronauts to be ready
to go out of the cabin to help. But there was a third try and it
was successful.
   ``We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the
starboard side has been deployed,'' the telescope control center in
Maryland said.
   ``So we have good news,'' said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble
control center.
   The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to
flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they
would use up their eight-hour charge.
   Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12{-ton
telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its
instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and
shifted over to the batteries.
   ``Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at
Kennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on
its own,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. ``The game has
begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.''
   Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on
spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk
outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the
solar panels failed.
   Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the
end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface
and a turning Earth in the background.
   Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver
maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nose
pointed toward the sun. That was to put the telescope's solar
arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start
collecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackers
while the instrument was being held above the payload bay.
   Discovery is in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher
than any previous shuttle. The orbit was dictated by the need to
put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
   ``For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to pass
on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (Hawley),
something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away
today,'' Shriver said.
   The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early this
morning as Mission Control played a song called ``Space is Our
World,'' written by members of Discovery's training team and a
Houston-area group, Private Numbers.
   Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight
Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected
so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned
spacecraft ever built.
   ``Everything has just being going like clockwork,'' said Ron
Schlagheck, shift director of orbital verifications at Goddard.
``Everybody is in excellent spirits.''
   The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986
Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in
space. It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboard
Discovery.
   Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. It
is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe,
and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes
and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support
life.
   The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in
diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it is in
orbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific
instruments from two winglike solar arrays.
   It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose
discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise
to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a
tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Seeks to Ease Workers' Fears About Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev traveled to the
depths of Russia on Wednesday to ease Soviets' fears about the
transition to a market economy but also got an earful of complaints
about empty store shelves.
   After a day of chats with workers in Sverdlovsk, an industrial
center 870 miles east of Moscow, Gorbachev admitted: ``It's
apparent that the people's expectations are at their limit. Their
patience is at a limit.''
   The Kremlin chief said he made the trip, his first since he was
elected to the expanded post of executive president last month, to
see how people feel about planned economic reforms.
   Major social unrest, including strikes, are feared if the
government carries out a preliminary plan to free prices, establish
a stock exchange, close inefficient industries and move toward
making the ruble a freely convertible currency.
   Inflation and unemployment could result from the phasing out of
price subsidies and the closure of unprofitable factories.
   Officials have said an economic safety net will be set up to
help low-income families cope with the blows.
   Gorbachev assured the Sverdlovsk workers no final decisions had
been made and won't be until May 10. The changes themselves are six
to eight months away, he added.
   ``Someone is throwing out the idea that somebody at the top
wants to raise prices, to introduce `shock therapy.' Don't believe
it,''' he told a huge crowd gathered outside the gigantic UralMash
machine-building complex.
   Nothing, he told the crowd, will be done behind their backs.
   Reports on Gorbachev's first day in Sverdlovsk filled a
half-hour of Soviet TV's nightly newscast ``Vremya.'' That ensured
a wide audience among this country's 280 million people would see
their leader's attempts to soften the blow of radical economic
reform.
   Gorbachev faced a storm of criticism from the crowd surrounding
him over the shortages of fruits and vegetables, a TV correspondent
said. The region ranks second in production in the Russian
federation but 40th or 50th in housing, hospitals, schools and
cultural establishments, the reporter noted.
   About 11,000 of UralMash's workers are living without adequate
housing, another correspondent said.
   Conspicuously absent from the TV coverage of Gorbachev's visit _
and perhaps indicating the leadership's sensitivity to direct
criticism _ was footage of the crowd complaining to the president.
Such complaints were reported by the official news agency Tass.
   Tass said UralMash workers also complained that there were no TV
sets and refrigerators in local stores and asked Gorbachev why
Sverdlovsk residents don't see the goods they produce on store
shelves.
   ``Everything that worries you worries me, too,'' Gorbachev
responded. ``Many problems have accumulated. We must undo them
soundly, all together. We are approaching that now, introducing
structural changes, including every enterprise, every person in the
economic reform.''
   Gorbachev advised workers to brace for a ``painful stage'' in
economic reform and appealed for help.
   ``We, there, must act more wisely, and you here must work more
wisely. Otherwise, nothing will come of it,'' he said. Some workers
hung out windows and others jumped in the crowd as they strained to
hear their president.
   Foreign reporters were not allowed toaccompany Gorbachev to
Sverdlovsk, a closed city that is the home ground of maverick
Communist politician Boris N. Yeltsin and a center for rock music.
   Sverdlovsk residents have taken to the streets with their
complaints several times over the past months, including a pre-New
Year's protest over a shortage of vodka.
   Party officials stopped the protests by flooding the stores with
reserves of vodka, but many of the city's 1.4 million residents
remain unhappy about the lack of other rationed items, including
meat, sugar and butter, the Soviet press has reported.
   Sverdlovsk is also one of several Russian centers where
Communist Party members recently ousted their local chief and
replaced him with a more progressive leader.

<HEAD>Conference Debates Court-Ordered Secrecy Agreements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Court-ordered secrecy agreements are helping
hide information about dangerous products, environmental hazards,
medical malpractice and unfair business practices, according to
consumers, lawyers and journalists attending a conference Wednesday.
   But proponents of the agreements argued that the accords are
private and should be maintained, that they are necessary to
protect manufacturers' trade secrets and American competitiveness
in international markets and that the civil court system is not
designed to disseminate information obtained in litigation.
   Information gathered during a lawsuit can be kept secret through
protective orders, confidentiality agreements or judicial sealing
of files.
   Such arrangements prohibit lawsuit participants from
distributing information they obtain, limit what can be shared with
others not involved in the lawsuit or make all records in a case
unavailable to the public.
   In some cases even the names of people or companies involved in
a suit are kept secret, with the court record titled ``Sealed vs.
Sealed.''
   ``Secrecy buries critical facts ... and the public good is
ignored and damaged'' by such practices, said Russ Herman,
president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, as he
opened the conference.
   ``In far too many of these cases, we're not talking about
irrelevant facts better left in the files of the litigants,'' said
Paul McMasters, deputy editorial director of USA Today.
   ``We're talking about documents and decisions involving unsafe
products, dangerous drugs, toxic wastes _ all with potentially
devastating effect on people unaware of the danger,'' added
McMasters, who heads the freedom of information committee of the
Society of Professional Journalists, cosponsor of Wednesday's
conference.
   But James Morris III, a Virginia attorney, argued that the
practice ``isn't limited to corporate information.''
   ``You're personal papers are also in those files,'' he warned.
   ``If you can summons my medical records from my doctor, my diary
from my psychiatrist or records of design from a company ...
privacy goes out the window,'' said Morris.
   Herman argued that such arrangements ``keep vital health and
safety information from the press, the regulatory agencies and the
public.''
   U.S. businesses are at a competitive disadvantage because
international agreements don't force foreign companies to release
the same extensive information, countered Morris.
   Opponents of the practice said the agreements have become a
commonly used threat of lengthy legal battle and tactic to
``bribe'' injured people and their families into settlement.
   ``A compromise is a compromise,'' countered Morris. ``If you sue
for $24 million and take $6 million you weren't bribed.''
   People who bring lawsuits against companies for potentially
dangerous products concede to the agreements because they can't
afford to continue litigation and they want to go on with their
lives, said Fred Barbee. Barbee's wife, Carol died after an
artificial heart valve fractured.
   He later learned she might have been saved if emergency room
doctors had treated her for the fractured valve and not the heart
attack they thought she was having.
   Morris said the agreements are ``private litigation between
private individuals and companies'' protected by the First
Amendment.
   ``There is nothing in the First Amendment that says you are
entitled to everything in a court file.''
   ``How can you call it private unless you can limit it to my
family?,'' asked Barbee.
   A proposal, backed by the Bush administration, to create a
uniform federal standard for imposing punitive damages in product
liability lawsuits and limit to two years most product liability
claims is pending in a Senate subcommittee.

   A bomb hidden in a dump truck exploded
Wednesday as a military unit hunted for the leader of the Medellin
drug cartel. At least six people were killed and nearly three dozen
were wounded, police said.
   Acting President Horacio Serpa called an emergency meeting of
the National Security Council. Tuesday night, just hours before he
left for Nicaragua, President Virgilio Barco put the military in
charge of two towns near Medellin.
   Scores of troops and armored cars mounted with cannons moved
into the towns, Bello and Estrella, on Wednesday. The government
has sent about 9,000 soldiers to the Medellin area in its battle
against the drug barons.
   Another town on the outskirts of Medellin, Envigado, was put
under military rule last month. The police said they are searching
the area for the head of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar.
   Wednesday's bombing came at 8:30 a.m. as a truck crept by with
20 members of Colombia's anti-terrorist strike force aboard.
   The blast destroyed a shoe store and a half-dozen automobiles
and collapsed the roofs on several small stores and houses. Three
bodies were found in the rubble of the shoe store, the Colombian
radio chain Caracol said.
   A high school student waiting for a bus also was killed.
   The bomb killed four civilians and two policemen and wounded 26
civilians and eight policemen, Medellin Police Chief Col. Humberto
Camero said.
   Many people aboard an old bus packed with passengers were
wounded. Commuters, their clothes torn and their bodies bloodied,
pleaded for help as they crawled from the bus' shattered windows,
witnesses told Caracol.
   The Medellin cartel has killed 60 Medellin policemen so far this
year in its effort to stop the government's policy of capturing
drug traffickers and extraditing them to the United States. The
cocaine cartel has offered a reward of $4,300 for each policeman
murdered. It is believed to be responsible for shipping much of the
cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.
   The bomb was the largest since April 11, when a car bomb
exploded on a busy Medellin highway and killed 20 people, including
eight members of the anti-terrorist police unit. More than 100
people were wounded.
   In communiques received by Colombian radio stations in the past
month, the cartel has vowed to kill all policemen.
   Late last year the drug traffickers' bombings keyed on the
capital of Bogota, killing about 200 people in scores of bombing
attacks.
   The traffickers apparently have switched to Medellin because the
army and police have moved thousands of officers into and around
Medellin to try to find Escobar.
   An anti-narcotics agent, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that authorities believe Escobar is in
the Medellin area. He apparently is trying to hold together his
multibillion-dollar drug empire, the agent said.
   Colombia has extradited 15 alleged cartel middlemen to be tried
in the United States. Last December, police killed the man who was
the second-most powerful member of the cartel, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   Government security forces have seized alleged traffickers'
properties and have said they found nearly $50 million in U.S.
cash, gold and platinum buried at confiscated ranches.

<TEXT>
   Artillery shells slammed into residential
districts Wednesday as rival Christian forces exchanged barrages,
killing 13 people and wounding 17, police said.
   Police said the shells fell on both sides of the Green Line
dividing the city's Christian and Moslem sectors.
   Five people were killed and four wounded in Moslem west Beirut.
Ambulances sped through the streets as people sought refuge in
basements and air raid shelters.
   West Beirut has not been involved in the fighting between the
Lebanese Forces militia led by Samir Geagea and the Christian
troops loyal to Gen. Michel Aoun. However, stray shells frequently
have fallen in west Beirut.
   Police said howitzer shells, rockets and tank cannon rounds also
hit residential districts in east Beirut and the Christian
hinterland north and northeast of the capital.
   The clashes raged despite repeated calls by Maronite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir for a cease-fire.
   Sfeir, in an appeal broadcast by local radio stations, called on
both Aoun and Geagea to ``stop fighting immediately. Have mercy on
the population which has been suffering for a long time.''
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 907 killed and
2,418 wounded since Geagea and Aoun began their struggle for
control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave on Jan. 30.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said Aoun's gunners concentrated their barrage from
U.S.-made 155mm howitzers on sea ports controlled by Geagea's
militia.
   ``The general is trying to impose a sea blockade on the Lebanese
Forces, keeping all their ports shut by shellfire,'' the spokesman
said.
   The shelling came two days after Geagea's gunboats blockaded
Aoun's sole sea outlet on the Dbaye coast, north of Beirut.
   Radio stations controlled by the rival Christian forces
repeatedly interrupted regular programming to broadcast reports
about the duels and to warn civilians.
   The power struggle between Geagea and Aoun has led to the worst
fighting among Christians in the country's 15-year-old multi-sided
civil war. It has caused damage estimated at $1 billion.
   The clashes also have forced at least 400,000 of the 1 million
people living in the Christian enclave to seek refuge in safer
areas of Lebanon or abroad.
   Aoun does not recognize the Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi.
He also opposes an Arab League-sponsored peace plan because it does
not include a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian
troops in Lebanon.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi as head of state.

   Two American Jewish groups and the Arab mayor
of Bethlehem are criticizing Israel for financing Jewish housing in
the Christian sector of Jerusalem.
   ``This could be a precedent for more attacks on church property,
Christian and Moslem, and I think that was a very foolish act,''
Mayor Elias Freij said Wednesday at a news conference.
   He also called the move ``a stupid thing.''
   Robert J. Lifton, president, and Henry Siegman, executive
director, of the American Jewish Congress expressed outrage over
the ``clandestine effort.''
   In a statement, Lifton and Siegman said the action threatens
U.S. support of Israel and complicates the task of raising money
from Jews around the world to help refuges from the Soviet Union
settling in Israel.
   The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish group dedicated to
promoting civil rights, said the action ``gives ammunition to those
wishing to upset the religious harmony in the holy city.''
   The disputed Jewish housing is in the Christian sector of East
Jerusalem, the predominantly Arab part of the city Israel captured
from Jordanian troops in the 1967 war.
   Freij called East Jerusalem ``occupied territory'' and said the
Israeli government's assistance to 150 new Jewish Soviet immigrants
to live in a four-building complex owned by the Greek Orthodox
Church ``is going to strain the situation to the extreme.''
   The settlement issue is being decided by Israeli courts.
   Congress has been considering guaranteeing a $400 million loan
to help resettle Soviet Jews in Israel. The Bush administration has
conditioned its support for the legislation, now before the Senate,
on a condition that Israel not use the money to house Soviet Jews
in the territories occupied in the 1967 war.
   Freij, a self-described moderate, also criticized Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir for not accepting U.S. terms for talks with
Palestinian Arabs.
   ``The Israelis are good at war,'' he said. ``They are bad when
it comes to peace. They have a complex.''
   Freij denied reports he had been threatened by Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat or that he ever
called for a halt to the Palestinian rebellion on the West Bank and
in Gaza.
   ``I respect him, he respects me,'' Freij said.
   The settling of Jewish refugees at St. John's Hospice was
criticized Monday by the State Department as ``an insensitive and
provocative act.''
   David A. Harris, Washington representative of the American
Jewish Committee, said Monday his group had expressed ``serious
concern'' to the Israeli government over the issue.
   And Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, questioned the timing of the move through
an emissary to Shamir.
   Dine told the Prime Minister the Israeli government was ``doing
great harm' to Israel's standing with the Bush administration and
the American public, sources close to the situation reported.
   AIPAC is the largest pro-Israel lobbying group and over the
years has managed to stop or stall U.S. arms sales to Arab
countries hostile to Israel.

<HEAD>Criminal Proceedings Begin on Alleged Iraqi `Super Gun' Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officials on Wednesday began criminal
proceedings against a British man allegedly involved in developing
a suspected ``super gun'' project for Iraq.
   Christopher Cowley was charged with involvement in the attempted
illegal export of equipment, a customs spokesman said.
   Sheffield Forgemasters, which made the eight giant tubes that
the government claims are part of a gun, has identified Cowley as
its main contact on the project.
   Cowley was employed by Space Research Corp., based in Belgium,
which was founded by cannon designer Gerald Bull. Bull, a
Canadian-born American citizen, was murdered in Brussels last month.
   Bull's son, Michel Bull, has said that Cowley left the company
in 1988. The family announced last week that the company was going
out of business.
   Customs said Cowley was charged with ``being knowingly concerned
in the attempted illegal exportation of equipment with intent to
evade a prohibition in force by virtue of the Export of Goods
Control Order 1987-1989.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the Trade and Industry Committee of the House
of Commons said it would hold an inquiry into the alleged gun
project.
   British customs officers seized eight sections of steel pipe
April 12 at the port of Middlesbrough, and Foreign Office minister
William Waldegrave said there is little doubt the cargo was
intended to be part of a gun.
   The Iraqi government and Sheffield Forgemasters said the tubes
were intended for a petrochemical plant.
   Sheffield Forgemasters said it had government permission to sell
the pipes to Iraq. The parliamentary committee said its inquiry
would cover export controls ``in relation to Iraq.''
   The British government imposed an arms embargo on Iran and Iraq
during their eight-year war and has not lifted it because no formal
cease-fire has been signed.
   Customs officers have said the tubes built by Sheffield
Forgemasters could be assembled to make a 131-foot-long gun barrel
with a bore of about 39 inches.
   The company has said that 44 sections of tubing have already
been delivered to Iraq.
   A second British company, Walter Somers Ltd., has also been
involved in the investigation. Trucks carrying steel forgings from
Somers were stopped in Turkey and Greece, and Greek authorities
arrested a British driver.
   Somers has confirmed its order also came from Space Research in
Brussels. Both companies have said they approached the government
Department of Trade and Industry in 1988 for clearance.

   Vice President Dan Quayle brought
symbolic gifts of flour and cooking oil, the first installment of
$24 million in U.S. food aid, for Wednesday's presidential
inauguration of Violeta Chamorro.
   He also brought word that President Bush, earlier in the day,
approved $2.5 million in medical supplies because he ``recognizes
the suffering of the people of Nicaragua.''
   Bush also signed a formal declaration that Nicaragua is no
longer a Marxist-Leninist country, restored its quota for sugar
exports to the United States and made businesses wishing to invest
in the Central American nation eligible for low-cost government
loans.
   Quayle, the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Nicaragua
sice then-President Carter in 1979, said Mrs. Chamorro faces
``herculean economic problems'' as she takes over from Daniel
Ortega.
   Still, Quayle called Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration after his
11-year presidency ``the miracle of Managua.''
   Talking with reporters as he flew to Managua, the vice president
said, ``Many people thought this day would never happen. Many
people thought democracy would never come to Nicaragua, and yet it
has.''
   Stopping his motorcade as it headed into the capital from the
airport, Quayle told several boys waiting at a dilapidated bus stop
that ``the U.S. wants to help you.''
   The motorcade passed several buildings with anti-American
slogans scrawled on their sides. As his limousine entered a
baseball stadium for the inaugural, an object, apparently a piece
of trash, was hurled toward his car and shouts of ``murderer''
arose from sections of the stands where Ortega's Sandinistas were
seated.
   The vice president briefly shook hands with Ortega and later
smiled tightly as Ortega, in his last speech as president,
denounced ``close-minded politicians'' in the United States and
called on Washington to ``stop dictating policies to Nicaragua.''
   The vice president said afterward that he had ``only heard
one-third'' of Ortega's speech, claiming a lot had been lost in the
translation, which was provided by a State Department translator as
Ortega spoke.
   As to Ortega's assertion that the United States had dictated
policies to Nicaragua, Quayle said:
   ``We're not dictating our policies to Nicaragua. The people of
Nicaragua determined their policy and their destiny.''
   Earlier, Quayle said that if he had the chance to talk with the
defeated leader, he would ``congratulate him for turning over power
in a peaceful way'' and ``discuss how a responsible opposition
conducts itself _ not engaging in intimidation and violence.''
   The bags of flour and cooking oil Quayle carried with him on Air
Force Two were to be followed later in the day by 1,000 tons of
food being ferried into the country aboard 24 relief trucks.
   The food shipments, initially flown to a U.S. base in Honduras,
were approved by Bush shortly after Mrs. Chamorro defeated Ortega
in February. Some $21 million of the aid was transferred from other
government relief efforts. In addition, $1.7 million in foodstuffs
was designated for orphans and Nicaragua will receive aid from the
Food for Progress program.
   Quayle also brought word that Bush had restored the 54,000-ton
quota for sugar shipments to the United States, suspended by
then-President Reagan in 1983 as part of an economic embargo
against Ortega's government, and had approved the dispatch of
medical supplies to hospitals and public health clinics that had
run short of medicine.
   The aid Quayle announced Wednesday would be dwarfed by $300
million in recovery aid Bush has asked Congress to approve for this
nation of 3.5 million people.
   Even if that assistance is approved _ it has been stalled in the
Senate in a dispute over unrelated legislation _ Quayle said much
more is needed to bring the Nicaraguan economy to its feet.
   ``She's got herculean economic problems. People are not only out
of work, but they are pessimistic. It will take an international
effort to rebuild Nicaragua.''
   But he called Mrs. Chamorro's victory ``a moment of triumph and
recovery'' and predicted she will be ``a symbol of unity.''
   He declined to criticize Mrs. Chamorro's decision to retain Gen.
Humberto Ortega _ the outgoing president's brother _ as head of the
armed forces.
   ``It shows she is trying to reconcile the differences in her
country. It's her decision and I'm certainly not going to second
guess her,'' he said, adding that Gen. Ortega ``could be helpful in
recapturing some of the arms they passed out to the Sandinistas
during the transition.''
   Expounding on her election, Quayle told a small crowd that
welcomed him at the airport:
   ``The walls are crumbling everywhere as people are saying, `No
more dictators. No more poverty. No more militaries.''

   President Bush honored seven citizens
Wednesday who have struck back against crime, saying their
grassroots efforts show Americans will do ``whatever it takes ...
to take back the streets.''
   They included John Walsh, creator of television's ``America's
Most Wanted'' show, which Bush called the ``video version of the
old post office `wanted' posters.'''
   Walsh, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., became an advocate for missing
and abused children after the abduction and murder of his own son,
Adam.
   Bush said that in less than two years on the air, ``America's
Most Wanted'' has helped nabbed more than 100 criminals.
   That shows ``the people of this country are prepared to do
whatever it takes for as long as it takes to take back the
streets,'' said Bush.
   The others honored for helping victims of crime were:
   _Howard and Constance Clery, of Bryn Mawr, Pa., who founded a
lobbying group called Security on Campus following the 1986 murder
of their daughter Jeanne in her Lehigh University dormitory.
   _Milton Cole, of Jamaica Plain, Mass., founder of a community
patrol in a Boston housing project.
   _Sandra Heverly, of Las Vegas, who became an activist for
Mothers Against Drunk Driving in 1983 after a family tragedy caused
by a drunken driver.
   _Dean G. Kilpatrick, of Charleston, S.C., credited with
pioneering research on the impact of crime on victims and
establishing a rape crisis center.
   _Emelia Olson, of Fort Thompson, S.D., who has helped channel
victim assistance and services for Sioux Indian children on the
Crow Creek Reservation.
   Bush also signed legislation designating this week as National
Crime Victims' Rights Week.

<HEAD>Justice Closes Investigation of DC Delegate Fauntroy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has declined to
prosecute Walter E. Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's delegate
to Congress, following a lengthy investigation of payroll practices
in his office.
   Fauntroy, a Democrat who is running for mayor of the nation's
capital, disclosed the Justice Department's decision in a statement
that was released Tuesday.
   The Justice Department also confirmed that it had closed the
investigation of Fauntroy's employment of Thomas John Savage, son
of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., at a time records indicated the younger
Savage was living in Chicago.
   The Justice Department's decision removes a cloud that had been
hanging over Fauntroy's campaign to succeed Mayor Marion Barry.
   The mayoral race was thrown wide open earlier this year when
Barry was arrested on cocaine possession charges. Barry
subsequently was indicted on charges of lying to a federal grand
jury by denying previous drug use.
   The mayor's arrest in an FBI sting operation came just days
before he was to announce his candidacy for a fourth term. Barry
has since said he will not announce his decision about seeking
re-election until after his trial, set to begin June 4.
   The Fauntroy probe was begun after The Associated Press reported
in December 1988 that the younger Savage earned $21,398 working for
Fauntroy between September 1987 and June 1988 _ a period Illinois
records show he was living in Chicago to meet residency
requirements for running for public office.
   Savage swore on election documents filed in connection with his
unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois legislature that he was
living in Chicago during the period in question.
   Asked whether the decision not to prosecute Fauntroy applied to
any inquiry into actions by the younger Savage, Justice Department
spokesman David Runkel said the ``action applies only to Delegate
Fauntroy.'' He would not elaborate.
   Following the initial stories, Fauntroy denied any wrongdoing
and said Savage worked as the Midwest coordinator for legislation
that would grant statehood to the District of Columbia.
   Savage said he worked every day that he drew a salary as a
member of Fauntroy's staff.
   The 15-month investigation examined the younger Savage's
financial records to determine if he returned any of the money he
had earned to Fauntroy or to his father, according to law
enforcement sources.
   A federal grand jury subpoenaed records and took testimony as
part of the investigation.
   Fauntroy was informed Monday of the Justice Department's
decision to close the investigation, said his campaign press
spokesman, Ivan Brandon.
   On Tuesday, Fauntroy issued a statement that he was ``pleased
that this matter has been closed and that this will no longer have
to divert attention from the real issues _ like drugs, crime and
housing _ that are facing the city.''

<TEXT>
   Felix Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of
spying for the Soviet Union, wants to suppress information from FBI
electronic surveillance of his activities, according to court
papers.
   Bloch, who is fighting State Department efforts to fire him, was
notified March 12 that the government would offer in his
termination proceeding ``certain information derived from
electronic surveillance,'' according to a Justice Department filing.
   Bloch asked the State Department to suppress the data ``on the
ground that this electronic surveillance was unlawful,'' said the
court papers filed by Justice Department attorney Richard Stearns.
   At the same time, Bloch is demanding from the government ``all
audio, video or other recordings made of Mr. Bloch'' and all
materials relating to the court authorization of surveillance of
Bloch ``or any member of his family,'' according to a State
Department document filed in the case.
   The government is seeking a ruling from U.S. District Court
Judge Stanley Harris that the court-authorized electronic
surveillance was legal. The government also opposes Bloch's demands
for additional surveillance recordings and documents used to
authorize the FBI activity.
   Surveillance in the Bloch matter was approved by the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, a panel of federal judges.
   The Justice Department court papers, dated April 17, were filed
as a civil case Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   Bloch's lawyer was furnished copies of the audio tapes and
transcripts of the electronic surveillance the government plans to
use, said the Justice Department. In addition, Bloch was offered
access to the monitoring logs of the surveillance operation.
   ``He has received information concerning the dates on which his
conversations were overheard, as well as the fact that this
electronic surveillance was authorized'' by the intelligence court,
said the Justice Department. ``Accordingly, no further classified
national security information need be released to Bloch or his
counsel.''
   Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Harris must
decide the legality of the surveillance without an adversary
hearing and based on FBI data, which Bloch must not be allowed to
see, the government asserted.
   A secret FBI exhibit filed with the judge ``contains sensitive
information concerning United States intelligence sources and
methods and other information relating to United States efforts to
conduct counterintelligence investigations,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said in an affidavit.
   Having an adversary hearing or disclosing to anyone besides the
judge data in the FBI exhibit and concerning the surveillance
``would harm the national security of the United States,'' said the
attorney general.
   Thornburgh authorized the State Department to use information
from the electronic surveillance in its employment termination
proceeding against Bloch.
   The State Department announced Feb. 8 that Bloch had been
suspended, his annual salary of $80,700 was being withheld and
steps were being taken to fire him.
   The administrative hearing in Bloch's case is scheduled to begin
May 7 before a three-person Foreign Service review board, which has
the option of reinstating him.
   Bloch is a 30-year foreign service officer who the State
Department put on paid leave June 22, 1989.
   Soon after, the State Department announced the FBI was
investigating him for ``illegal activities'' involving ``agents of
a foreign intelligence service.'' No criminal charges have been
filed against Bloch.

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Consumers Like Beef Labeling Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A change in federal labeling for lean beef has
gone over well with consumers, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   The labeling took effect in November 1987 after consumers and
industry petitioned USDA for a name change in official federal beef
grading, said Jimmy Wise of the department's Agricultural Marketing
Service.
   ``Consumers told us they wanted a more positive description of
leaner meat available in grocery stores, and they got it,'' he said.
   The change involved scrapping the 60-year-old ``USDA Good''
label and substituting a ``USDA Lean'' label on supermarket cuts.
   Many nutrition-conscious consumers wanted the name change
because they felt the ``Good'' label misled buyers into thinking
the beef was mediocre. When the label was established in the 1920s,
it described the amount of fat, or marbling, in a cut of beef.
   A common consumer view was that less fat was more healthful and
that the ``Good'' label wasn't very descriptive.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Jewish immigrants demonstrated Wednesday
near Israel's parliament, accusing the government of failing to
come up with a clear plan of absorbing the flood of Soviet Jews.
   A senior official at the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which
helps handle immigration, said meanwhile that absorption failures
may lead to an ``historic mistake'' of stopping the expected Soviet
Jewish influx, Israel radio reported.
   ``There is no system of decision-making and I don't see it being
formed tomorrow morning,'' agency treasurer Meir Shitreet said in a
broadcast lecture.
   The immigration has been spurred by growing anxiety over the
Soviet Union's future and the spread of anti-Semitism there, as
well as by U.S. visa restrictions. It is expected to total 100,000
this year.
   About 24,200 Soviet Jews have arrived so far this year,
according to figures released by Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz
and cited by Israel radio.
   The wave has caused housing shortages and the immigrants also
face Israel's increasing unemployment rate and bureaucracy.
   The Housing Ministry is expected to present to the parliament on
Thursday a program of building 32,500 apartments for Soviet Jews,
Israel Television said. It said the program does not include plans
to build housing in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The Arab world, especially, has complained that Israel plans to
settle Soviet Jews in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lands seized
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

   A record 492,000 acres of national forest land
was replanted with trees last year, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said the acreage was the
most since the national forest system was created in 1905.
   Robertson said last year's effort was due in part to
rehabilitation work in areas burned by the major fires of 1987 in
California, Oregon and Washington, and to high levels of
reforestation in areas of 1986-88 timber harvests in the national
forests.
   Of the total area reforested in the fiscal year that ended last
Sept. 30, about 307,000 acres were directly seeded or planted with
trees. The remaining 185,000 acres were reforested through natural
regeneration, by seed falling from nearby trees onto areas prepared
by the Forest Service, or through sprouting.
   Robertson said the previous record was 434,000 acres reforested
in 1980. An estimated 460,000 acres will be reforested this fiscal
year, he said.
   A spokesman said that on the average four or five trees are
planted for each one harvested. That takes into account attrition
from drought, fire, disease and other causes as the trees grow.
   The Forest Service manages 191 million acres of forest and
rangeland.

<HEAD>State Department Advises Americans To Leave Liberia</HEAD>

   The State Department on Wednesday advised
Americans to leave Liberia because of increased fighting between
government and rebel forces.
   The department also authorized U.S. government personnel and
their families to leave Liberia if they wish.
   President Bush, meanwhile, said he will nominate a career
diplomat, Peter Jon de Vos, to be the U.S. ambassador to Liberia.
The nomination of De Vos, now principal deputy assistant secretary
of state in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental
and Scientific Affairs, must be approved by the Senate.
   The decision comes at a time of growing tension between the two
countries following the deaths of two Americans in recent weeks,
Liberia's worsening human rights record and its failure to repay
its debts.
   The United States has been cautioning Americans to defer
non-essential travel to Liberia since fighting broke out last
December when the government attacked some 200 rebels it accused of
trying to overthrow President Samuel Doe. U.S. officials say some
of the rebels were trained by Libya.
   Thousands of Liberians fled the fighting to neighboring Ivory
Coast, and witnesses described indiscriminate attacks by government
troops against innocent civilians. Western diplomats reported
hundred of Liberians were killed.
   The United States, in an effort to control the government
troops' actions, sent two military advisers from the U.S. Embassy
in Monrovia to Nimba Province to monitor the crackdown on the
rebels. The advisers were later withdrawn.
   The embassy recommended this week that Americans leave the
country ``until the situation stabilizes,'' the State Department
said. Those who must travel to Liberia should not leave the capital
and should register with the U.S. Embassy upon their arrival, the
statement said.
   U.S. officials estimate there are about 10,000 Americans in
Liberia, most of them missionaries and businessmen. The country was
established in 1847 by former African slaves who left the United
States.
   A U.S. missionary and his British wife were killed several weeks
ago in Nimba, where most of the fighting is taking place, when
their car was ambushed as they drove to Monrovia.
   Another American died two weeks ago from a leg wound after being
shot by Liberian troops at a roadblock in Monrovia.
   The two incidents, as well as a suspicious fire at two embassy
warehouses in Monrovia last month, raised tensions to one of their
highest points since Doe took power in a bloody coup 10 years ago.
The administration has proposed cuts in aid to Liberia _ from $8.9
million this year to $7.5 million for fiscal 1991, citing human
rights abuses and corruption.

<TEXT>
   Two Montana stops on a U.S.
government-funded tour by a group of Soviet writers has been
canceled because some are reputedly anti-Semitic.
   The Montana Council for International Visitors on Monday
canceled the group's scheduled appearances after the host of one,
Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation, said it
wouldn't receive the writers.
   College president Janine Pease-Windy Boy said she hadn't known
of the reputed anti-Semitism when she agreed to the eight-member
group's visit.
   She said the college and the community believed that Indians, as
minorities themselves, could not appear to condone bigotry against
others.
   The writers had been scheduled to visit the college and Billings
on May 6-9.
   Council Director Wendy Lewis said the organization doesn't
``screen visitors for their political opinions.'' But, she said,
the controversy surrounding some of the writers' views had
destroyed the chance for meaningful dialogue.
   Lewis added that she was ``in full agreement'' with the Crow
Indian leader.
   Pease-Windy Boy complained that the U.S. Information Agency,
which is sponsoring the tour, told her that the delegation included
Soviet dissidents who were controversial. She said she only later
learned of the reputed anti-Semitism.
   ``They seemed to think it was inconsequential,'' she said.
   The agency has defended the tour as a means of exposing the
Soviet writers to democracy in action.
   Spokesman Frank S. Johnson Jr. has said, ``I don't know that
they are anti-Semitic; I don't know that they are not, either. ...
We feel very strongly that pluralism in this country is worth
talking about and observing.''
   Johnson said the writers were picked by officials in the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow who were seeking to bring conservative Russian
nationalists to the United States.
   He did not immediately return a call Wednesday seeking comment
on the Montana developments.
   The American Jewish Committee has complained that the tour gives
known anti-Semites legitimacy and prestige.
   Semyon Reznick, a Soviet Jewish emigre whose studies were used
by the committee, said some writers in the group ``exuded the myth
of a Jewish-Zionist conspiracy, an old Russian hatred'' in their
work.
   Reznick said that Stanislav Kunyaev, as editor of Nash
Sovremenik (Our Contemporary), wrote an article praising the
long-discredited ``Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' as ``written
by very clever people who understand the history of mankind.''
   The notorious protocols purport to be an account of a meeting of
Jewish leaders plotting to control the world. Their 19th century
origin is obscure, but they have been used by anti-Semites
including Hitler and the czar's secret police before the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   Reznick said Kunyaev also had written that ``not Bolsheviks but
Jews'' had killed the victims of the revolution.
   He said another tour member, Olveg Mikhaylov, wrote of the 18th
century Russian writer Gavril Gerzhavin as a ``victim of a Jewish
plot.''
   The group also includes Pavel Gorelov, Svetlana Selivanova,
Leonid Borodin, Viktor Likhonosov, Svyatoslav Rybas and Ernst
Safonov.
   The April 14-May 13 tour also scheduled visits to Washington;
Pittsburgh; Iowa City, Iowa; Urbana and Kansas, Ill.; Oxford,
Miss.; San Francisco, and New York City.

<TEXT>
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr is reviewing
the results of an investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of
a criminal investigation involving Rep. William H. Gray III,
officials said Wednesday.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh asked Starr to review the results of the
criminal investigation of the news leaks and a separate report by
the department's Office of Professional Responsiblity.
   The investigation, supervised by the Justice Department's
criminal division, concluded that Thornburgh's spokesman, David
Runkel, played a role in confirming to CBS reporter Rita Braver
that the FBI was investigating alleged financial irregularities in
Gray's office.
   In a statement last week, Thornburgh defended Runkel, saying his
spokesman was following standing orders not to mislead reporters
when he did not steer Ms. Braver off a story obtained from other
sources.
   Eramian refused to say why Thornburgh had asked Starr to review
the issue, but acknowledged that the referral came after
discussions with the chairmen of the House and Senate judiciary
committees.
   Thornburgh discussed the case Friday with the two chairmen, Rep.
Jack Brooks, D-Texas, and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., Eramian
said.
   The report about Gray was aired last spring while the
Pennsylvania Democrat was running for House majority whip and
sparked charges from House Democrats that leaks about the
investigation were politically inspired.
   Outrage from Capitol Hill prompted the Justice Department to say
that Gray was not a target of the investigation.
   The leak investigation subsequently ordered by Thornburgh was
concluded late last year without any criminal charges being
brought. Thornburgh reported to Congress that he found no basis for
disciplining any Justice Department employees.
   Under pressure from lawmakers, Thornburgh earlier this month
asked the Office of Professional Responsibility to review the
findings and make recommendations.
   The report by Michael Shaheen, head of the department's internal
watchdog unit, concurred with the criminal division's finding that
there was no basis for criminal charges, according to a source.
Shaheen did not recommend any discipinary sanctions, said the
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

   The United States will donate $10.8 million
worth of agricultural commodities to Nicaragua, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday.
   Yeutter said the donations under a Food for Progress arrangement
include $5.1 million worth of corn, about 44,000 metric tons; $1.4
million worth of inedible tallow, about 5,000 tons; and $4 million
worth of vegetable oil, about 6,500 tons.
   Under the Food for Peace program, Nicaragua will get 800 tons of
wheat flour, 200 tons of vegetable oil and 95 tons of a wheat-soy
blended food product. Those products are valued at $350,000.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds, about 10 percent larger than
a U.S. short ton of 2,000 pounds.
   Additional donations are being considered, Yeutter said.
   The Food for Progress program ``is intended to support
development of free enterprise elements in the agricultural
economies of recipient countries,'' the announcement said. The Food
for Peace donations will be distributed immediately to needy people
by private voluntary charitable organizations, it said.

   An experimental vertically landing aircraft
plunked itself down on the Capitol grounds Wednesday, sending
spectators scurrying up the steps of the Capitol with its prop wash
and setting off praise from members of Congress as the greatest
thing in aviation since jet engines.
   Some members also denounced plans of the Pentagon to stop
development of a successor plane, the V-22 Osprey, after spending
$2 billion.
   Members of the House Public Works aviation subcommittee, in a
series of statements at a hearing, showed nearly unanimous support
for the Osprey's potential to serve cities with congested airports
and airways and small towns without conventional airports.
   The plane that landed at the Capitol actually was a 12-year-old
XV-15, predecessor to the V-22 made by Boeing Helicopters and Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc. Only two XV-15s were made. Pentagon
contracts call for six Ospreys, two of which have been delivered.
   The XV-15 and the V-22 are powered by two turboprop engines
which tilt up so their propellers, normally pulling the plane
forward, act like helicopter rotors for take-off and landing. In
forward flight, its 340 mph top speed is significantly faster than
most helicopters.
   Only Rep. John J. Duncan, R-Tenn., raised a negative note,
asking why, if the plane has such great potential, aircraft
manufacturers and airlines are not paying to develop it.
   Supporters said it often is necessary for expensive new aircraft
to begin as military hardware.
   ``Let's give it to the Marine Corps and let them try to break
it'' before its developed for commercial use, said Rep. Jim
Lightfoot, R-Iowa, who said he has piloted a tiltrotor and is sold
on its potential for civilian use.
   The Marines sought the Osprey for use as an assault transport,
to carry 24 troops or weapons and supplies from ship to beachhead
in amphibious landings. But the Defense Department argues that
helicopters already are doing the job and money for the Osprey can
be better used elsewhere when budgets are tight.
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., brought applause at the hearing when
he said, ``I can count on less than one hand the the new military
weapons systems I will support, but this is one of them.''
   ``Welcome to the dawn of a new age in aviation,'' said committee
chairman Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who told the committee it
took everything but a papal decree to allow the XV-15 one-day
landing rights on the east side of the Capitol.
   ``This is the most significant contribution to civilian aviation
since the dawn of the jet age,'' Oberstar told reporters on the
Capitol lawn after making a similar declaration to open the hearing
in a nearby office building.
   Joseph Del Balzo, head of systems development for the Federal
Aviation Administration, said the Japanese are working on a
tiltwing aircraft, possibly to be built in Texas, but would likely
be interested in taking up the tiltrotor technology if the United
States abandons it.
   Del Balzo told the committee the FAA will continue to spend
about $7 million a year over the next three years to research and
prepare for tiltrotor aircraft, whether U.S. or foreign built.
   Use of an aircraft similar to the Osprey to ferry passengers
around the busy Northeast corridor could increase the number of
passengers carried by from five million to eight million per year,
Del Balzo said.

<HEAD>Experts Say Polio To Be Disappear From Western Hemisphere This
Year</HEAD>

   Polio probably will be stamped out by the end
of the year in the Western Hemisphere, according to public health
experts who say health workers are making surprising progress
against the crippling disease in Latin America.
   When the Pan American Health Organization in 1985 set 1990 as a
goal for eradicating polio in the Americas, ``we all said this is
going to be tough ... that probably is optimistic,'' D.A.
Henderson, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said
in an interview Wednesday.
   ``Then suddenly this program began to move and polio has
vanished at a pace we could not believe,'' said Henderson,
president of the Association of Schools of Public Health, which met
in Washington this week.
   ``At the moment we're having a hard time finding the virus at
all,'' he said, crediting efforts that included health workers
going door-to-door with the vaccine in urban and other high risk
areas.
   Last year, 22 cases of infection from the virus were reported in
Central and South America, with most occurring in areas along the
western coast of Mexico and the Andean countries of Peru, Ecuador
and Colombia, Henderson said.
   Before the polio vaccine was introduced in 1954, thousands of
people in the United States were paralyzed by the disease every
year. The last cases of polio in the United Sates were reported in
the late 1970s.
   Worldwide, there were about 250,000 cases of polio last year,
the shortened name for poliomyelitis, which is caused by a virus in
contaminated water or food.
   The biggest problem areas are in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and
sub-Saharan Africa, Henderson said.
   The Pan American Health Organization has set the year 2000 as
the goal for global eradication of polio.
   But ridding the world of polio is proving more difficult than
the campaign that eradicated smallpox in 1977, Henderson said.
   The polio vaccine must be kept refrigerated until it is
administered, and this has posed a problem in getting supplies of
the vaccine into areas of developing nations, he said.
   Also, surveillance was easier with smallpox since those infected
with the virus had a rash. Polio infection is evident when an
infected person becomes paralyzed, but only one in 100 people
infected with the polio virus become paralyzed. In the others, the
infection is silent and immunizes the carrier from further
infection for life, Henderson said.
   Freeing the Western Hemisphere from the crippling disease will
be a big step toward the global goal, but ``it will be more
difficult'' to eradicate the disease in the Eastern Hemisphere, he
said.

   Journalism students at Southern Illinois
University tied yellow ribbons around trees Wednesday to remember
kidnapped journalist Terry Anderson, the longest-held Western
hostage in Lebanon.
   The students, who have been wearing black and yellow armbands
this week, held the ceremony to increase awareness of the plight of
Anderson and six other American hostages, said Jackie Spinner,
president of the student chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists. Seventeen Western hostages are held in Lebanon.
   ``We can't bring Terry or any of the other hostages home by
wearing black armbands, selling bumper stickers or tying ribbons
around trees,'' she said.
   ``But we can remind ourselves that the free flow of information
is not possible in all parts of the world.''
   The chapter designated Wednesday as Terry Anderson Day and
celebrated it as part of journalism week activities.
   Proceeds from sales of armbands and bumper stickers will be
donated to the Journalists Committee to Free Terry Anderson.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
has been held since March 16, 1985.

   Rain was scattered across the central part of the nation
Wednesday, dampening some drought-plagued areas, and temperatures
were unseasonably high from the upper Mississippi Valley to the
central East Coast.
   Record highs included 82 at International Falls, Minn., the
border town in the North Woods that likes to call itself the
nation's icebox.
   At midday, rain and thunderstorms extended across eastern
Wyoming, central and eastern Colorado, western North Dakota, South
Dakota, western and southern Nebraska, western and central Kansas,
western and central Oklahoma, and from north-central Texas to the
Texas Big Bend.
   Farmers in southwestern North Dakota rejoiced at the steady
rain, which forecasters said could continue through the weekend.
   ``It's great. It's beautiful. If it keeps up for two days,
everybody will be well,'' said Lyle Donner of Reeder.
   North Dakota is entering its third straight year of drought, and
Gov. George Sinner declared the state a drought disaster area
Tuesday.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
0.98 of an inch at San Angelo, Texas, and 0.86 at Abilene, Texas.
   From Tuesday night into early Wednesday, Texas had severe storms
that spawned tornadoes and dumped 13 inches of rain in Burleson
County and 9 inches in Mathis.
   In eastern Texas, 10 oil field workers who were stranded by
floodwater surrounding an oil lease south of Caldwell were rescued
by boat Wednesday morning.
   Caldwell itself was cut off by flooded roads after 13.04 inches
of rain fell in 10 hours. Inmates were evacuated from the Burleson
County jail. A Red Cross spokesman said all local motels were full
and 15 stranded motorists spent the night in a shelter at the First
Baptist Church Family Life Center. Several families were forced
from their homes, the spokesman said.
   A tornado damaged a truck stop outside the town of Shamrock in
the Texas Panhandle.
   About 70 miles from Shamrock in western Oklahoma, a tornado cut
a three-block swath through the town of Shattuck, destroying three
mobile homes and 10 businesses, causing major damage to about 17
homes and businesses and minor damage to 41 homes, said Della
Stump, executive secretary of the Red Cross in Woodward.
   Five to six people suffered minor injuries during the storm, the
Red Cross said.
   Other record highs were 87 at Alpena, Mich.; 87 at Chicago; 86
at Cleveland; 80 at Duluth, Minn.; 86 at Flint, Mich.; 84 at
Madison, Wis.; 86 at Milwaukee; 87 at Pittsburgh; 84 at Sault Ste.
Marie, Mich.; 88 at Toledo, Ohio, and 86 at Youngstown, Ohio. South
Bend, Ind., tied its record of 86.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over central and southern New
England, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and south-central
Pennsylvania.
   In the Northwest, rain fell across Washington state as well as
northern and western Oregon.
   Winter-like weather lingered in the Northwest. Snow fell over
the northern and west-central mountains of Wyoming and over La Veta
Pass in Colorado, and a snow advisory was issued for the Washington
Cascades.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36 at
Laramie, Wyo., to 92 at Goldsboro, N.C.

<TEXT>
   Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota are
going to Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency for help
in battling a looming invasion of grasshoppers.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee late Tuesday added $6.8
million to an emergency spending bill to help control the
infestation expected in the drought-parched region this summer.
   The extra money could be used for spraying both crops and land
set aside for conservation purposes. The Agriculture Department
budget this year contained just $8.7 million for control of both
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets, primarily on grasslands.
   Severe grasshopper outbreaks are expected in the three states
this summer, with some areas reporting 1,000 or more grasshoppers
per square yard, said Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., chairman of the
agricultural appropriations subcommittee.
   ``Just eight grasshoppers per yard can cause economic losses, so
we have a disaster developing,'' Burdick said.
   In the meantime, EPA scientists are meeting this week to decide
whether to approve a emergency request from the three states to let
farmers use the pesticide Asana-XL on grasshopper eggs.
   EPA ecologists are concerned because seven states altogether are
seeking exemptions for the pesticide. If all of them were approved,
the pesticide would be used 400 times as much as it is now, EPA
spokesman Al Heier said Wednesday.
   He said he did not know when a final decision would be made.
   The pesticide currently is registered on some crops but not on
small grains or on land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve
Program.
   ``There is a very large acreage involved here and a high usage
rate so we have to be careful with risks like this,'' said
Stephanie Irene, deputy director for the EPA's registration
division.

   The House began debating a guns-for-butter
Democratic alternative to President Bush's 1991 budget Wednesday as
a leading Democrat gave a cold shoulder to formal talks with the
White House.
   Democratic leaders predicted passage of their $1.24 trillion
package, despite widespread opposition from the Republican minority.
   Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said congressional
budget work would proceed without waiting for formal
deficit-reduction talks with the administration.
   Congressional Republicans, White House officials and some
Democrats have called for such bargaining for months, saying it's
the only way to realistically craft a way to shrink the budget
shortfall.
   ``I don't foresee an official, high-level, extraordinary
summit'' on the budget, Gephardt told reporters before debate began.
   However, Gephardt conceded that it would be ``unrealistic'' to
expect Congress to do all of this year's budget work without some
kind of input from the administration.
   The Democratic plan would give the Pentagon $8 billion less next
year than Bush wants. At the same time, it would spend $5.6 billion
more than Bush on efforts ranging from the fight against AIDS to
highway construction.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the budget
panel, said the Democratic plan's defense cuts would never be
enacted, calling the proposal ``a dream, a letter to Santa Claus.''
   Democrats said their package spelled out a clear difference
between their goals and those of Bush, who they said has responded
insufficiently to the weakening of the Soviet bloc.
   ``The greatest test of our nation's leadership in the '90s is
not military, but rather the challenge of competing economically in
an increasingly complex world economic environment,'' said House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Democratic leaders said they expected to get enough support from
the House's 40 conservative Democrats to pass the measure. Last
week, conservatives expressed concern that the package was too
stingy to the military.
   The package allocates $295.5 billion for defense spending next
year, compared with Bush's request for $303.8 billion. The House
figure is $11.5 billion below the amount the military would need to
stay abreast of inflation.
   It claims to reduce the deficit by $36 billion, to $63.8 billion
_ just within the $64 billion shortfall target required for next
year by the Gramm-Rudman law. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1.
   Besides the defense cuts, it relies on $13.9 billion in new tax
receipts, the same amount Bush wants.
   The Democratic plan, however, does not specify which taxes
should be increased. Instead, in deference to Bush's oft-repeated
opposition to a major tax increase, the proposal says no tax
legislation will move through Congress ``unless and until ... there
is a bipartisan agreement with the president of the United States
on specific legislation'' to raise taxes.
   The Democratic budget also calls for a $3.8 billion slowdown in
the growth of benefit programs, including Medicare, and $1.4
billion in user fees.
   In addition, it seeks $9.3 billion in savings proposed
originally by the administration but derided by Congress as
unrealistic, such as $2.5 billion by improving Internal Revenue
Service efficiency.
   A final House vote on the spending plan was tentatively planned
for Tuesday.
   The Senate Budget Committee planned to begin voting on its own
budget Thursday. The panel conducted little business when it met
briefly Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The leader of a successful campaign to block
Senate confirmation of Victor Stello Jr. as head of nuclear weapons
production criticized the administration Wednesday for keeping
Stello in the weapons program.
   ``The administration is pulling a fast one on Congress and the
public,'' said Stephen Schwartz, legislative coordinator for
Greenpeace U.S.A., which said Stello's work as a civilian nuclear
power regulator was tainted by a lack of commitment to safety.
   The Energy Department announced Tuesday _ exactly nine months
after Stello was nominated to be assistant secretary for defense
programs _ that Stello had asked President Bush to withdraw the
nomination. It said Stello would be given a lesser position in the
weapons program that did not require Senate confirmation.
   The department released copies of a letter Stello sent to Bush
last Friday in which he said he was withdrawing because he saw no
chance of gaining confirmation ``in the foreseeable future.''
   Greenpeace said Stello, who started working for the department
last summer after taking temporary leave from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, should not be allowed to continue working on
the nuclear weapons program.
   Department spokesman Tom Olson said Stello's responsibilities
would include overseeing the restart of nuclear material production
at the Savannah River reactors in South Carolina.
   ``Retaining Stello to manage these critical tasks sends a
message that, despite all the fine rhetoric, the fundamental
priorities of the DOE have not changed,'' Schwartz said.
   In a joint statement, Sen. Samm Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking
Republican on the panel, said Bush had formally withdrawn the
nomination and that the matter was closed.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, who urged the committee to
confirm Stello last fall, has made no public comment on the
withdrawal.

   Opponents of the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power
plant appealed to the nation's top judge Wednesday to interrupt
start-up of the plant pending court appeals.
   In a petition to Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
the opponents repeated arguments about the safety of the plant and
the alleged inadequacy of evacuation plans.
   But those arguments have failed to persuade the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Court of Appeals. A full federal
appeal is scheduled for Sept. 18, but by that time, opponents
argue, Seabrook will already be operating at full power.
   The petition, filed by Massachusetts Attorney General James
Shannon, the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and the New England
Coalition on Nuclear Pollution, seeks an immediate stay on the
Seabrook license granted March 1 by the NRC.
   The filing said a radioactive plume from the plant could reach
inhabited beach areas in as little as one hour, whereas it would
take six hours to 10 hours to evacuate the some 250,000 tourists
and seasonal residents who flock into the Seabrook emergency zone
during the summer months.
   Rehnquist issued no immediate response to the petition.
   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said ``We received the license from
the NRC because we earned that license. Seabrook station is a safe
plant.''
   The Seabrook reactor is operating at about 8 percent power.
   Full power operation is expected by early summer.

   Another 200,000 people will be resettled from
areas irradiated in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in
a $26 billion program adopted by the Soviet legislature on
Wednesday, the eve of the fourth anniversary of the disaster.
   Many members of the legislature, the Supreme Soviet, criticized
the plan as inadequate to deal with the health, agricultural,
economic and environmental aftermath of the Ukraine accident.
Legislator Yuri Scherback estimated 250 billion rubles ($405
billion) are needed over the next 10 years.
   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four
reactors at Chernobyl caught fire and exploded April 26, 1986.
Unofficial reports say 250 died. The blast spewed cesium, strontium
and plutonium across much of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia
and sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world.
   After a day of debate, including charges of an official cover-up
of the disaster and bungled evacuations, the Supreme Soviet
endorsed a program drafted by the three affected republics and the
central government for dealing with Chernobyl from 1990-92, Tass
news agency reported. About 180,000 to 200,000 people still living
in contaminated areas will be resettled.
   About 116,000 people were evacuated in the months after the
accident, and some Soviet scientists and politicians have been
campaigning since then for further resettlements. They say 4
million Soviets are living on contaminated land.
   Wednesday's resolution also provides for stepping up medical aid
to residents of the contaminated zone and stabilizing radiation
levels.
   Many residents have complained of inadequate medical care. Cases
of anemia, leukemia and cancers have been reported rising among
people living on irradiated land. Many residents still eat
irradiated food because alternatives are not available.
   After years of passivity, the people suffering have been staging
demonstrations this week. Further protests are planned Thursday,
the fourth anniversary, in Byelorussia and the Ukraine.
   A 24-hour world telethon for Chernobyl victims began in Moscow
Wednesday night and had raised $4.8 million in the first few hours,
Tass reported. CNN showed live scenes of the telethon to U.S.
viewers. Many of the donations came from the United States, Japan
and Western Europe, Tass said.
   Protesters demand trials for the officials who concealed the
extent of the danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas;
better medical care for victims; and the import of radiation-free
food.
   Dealing with the larger questions posed by Chernobyl, the
Supreme Soviet directed the government to draft a bill on the use
of nuclear energy and nuclear safety, and to phase out the
Chernobyl power plant. The plant's three remaining reactors are
still operating. The Ukrainian legislature wants the plant closed
by 1995.
   Several other nuclear power projects around the country were
canceled because of heightened safety concerns generated by
Chernobyl.
   Scherbak, from the Ukraine, told a news conference Wednesday a
parliamentary commission should be set up to examine
decision-making in the Chernobyl disaster, and to determine which
high government officials were responsible for slow reaction to it
and the cover-up.
   Fellow legislator Yuri Voronezhtsev, from Byelorussia, told
reporters the commission is needed to single out officials still
standing in the way of a full accounting and cleanup.
   ``The main thing is not to bring criminal charges against people
... but there are people who have not acknowledged their mistakes
who are braking things today,'' he said.

   The Bush administration on Wednesday asked
Congress to strengthen the Food and Drug Administration's authority
to act against companies that abuse or defraud the agency.
   The legislation was submitted in response to the generic drug
scandal in which drug manufacturers were found to have
misrepresented their products and bribed FDA officials to win
approval to market their drugs.
   ``We must have the legal tools to move quickly and decisively
against anyone who seeks to mislead or subvert the FDA,'' said
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   The measure would authorize the FDA to debar anyone the agency
considered a threat to the integrity of the agency's product review
process and to refuse to review or approve any products submitted
by a debarred company.
   Also, the FDA would be able to withdraw improperly approved
products and could suspend for two years approvals of other
products granted to a debarred company during the period when
illegal activity occurred.
   The FDA also could impose fines in cases of bribery, fraud or
other illegal acts committed during an FDA product-approval
process, under the legislation.
   Under current law, the FDA can only ask a drug manufacturer to
remove a product from the market, unless the product is a threat to
public health. Otherwise the agency must go through the courts to
remove a product if a company refuses a request for a recall.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. and the chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee that uncovered much of the evidence of
fraud and abuse in the generic drug scandal, said the legislation
``is well intentioned, but we're going to continue working on our
own.''
   One source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
administration's proposal presents practical difficulties in
winning passage this year because it is so sweeping, affecting
anyone whose product requires FDA approval.

   Jurors tried to report they were
deadlocked Wednesday at the bank fraud trial of U.S. Rep. Harold
Ford, but a federal judge told them to keep deliberating.
   ``It is far too early for you to report that you are hopelessly
deadlocked,'' U.S. District Judge Odell Horton said.
   After seven hours of deliberations over two days, jury foreman
H.O. Robinson told Horton that the jury was deadlocked. Horton
stopped him from continuing and held a conference at his bench with
prosecutors and defense lawyers.
   The judge then told the jury to return Thursday and resume its
deliberations.
   Ford is accused of taking payoffs disguised as bank loans from
banking brothers Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr. Also standing trial are
former Butcher accountant David Crabtree and lawyers Karl
Schledwitz and Douglas Beaty.
   The Memphis Democrat, first elected in 1974, is charged with
conspiracy and fraud. Ford, the state's only black congressman, has
complained that he is the victim of racist prosecutors, an
allegation the government has denied.
   After the jury was dismissed, Ford met with his attorneys in a
small room off the court, emerging later and professing his
confidence as he pushed through a crowd of reporters.
   ``We still anticipate a unanimous vote for acquittal,'' Ford
said.
   Earlier Wednesday, the jury asked for transcripts, notebooks and
a blackboard but Horton refused the transcripts, which would be
voluminous and could take as long as 30 days to provide. The other
items were provided.
   The jury began deliberating Tuesday after hearing 2{ months of
testimony and arguments. Jurors asked for and received all 170
exhibits from the trial, including bank documents, tax returns and
records of Ford's personal finances.
   Prosecutors called 29 witnesses and outlined a complicated
series of Butcher loans to Ford from 1976 to 1982. The defense
called no witnesses, and Ford said he decided not to testify
because he regarded the government's case as weak.
   The government says Ford drew more than $1 million in Butcher
loans, bouncing them from bank to bank with few, if any, payments
made until the Butcher banking empire collapsed in 1983.

   Two prominent eye doctors confirmed Wednesday
that President Bush has a mild form of glaucoma, but said he can
discontiue using prescription eye drops.
   ``Extensive testing of the eye, including detailed photographs,
once again revealed no abnormalities and no visual loss,'' said Dr.
Burton Lee, the White House physician. ``It was decided to stop the
Betagan eye drops and follow him closely for now, on no treatment.''
   Other physicians earlier prescribed the drops every 12 hours and
said Bush would have to use them for the rest of his life.
   Stephen Hart, deputy White House press secretary, said the
decision to take the Bush off the medication was ``simply a
difference of opinion'' with the other doctors.
   ``There is no progression or regression'' in the glaucoma, Hart
said. ``There is no change in his eyes.''
   Bush flew by helicopter to Bethesda Naval Hospital in nearby
suburban Maryland for the checkup by Dr. Richard Brubaker of the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and Dr. Harry Quigley of Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
   Both physicians are experts on glaucoma.
   The president spent about an hour in the hospital. Wearing dark
glasses as he left, he flashed a thumbs-up sign to reporters as he
was driven past in his limousine.
   During Bush's annual checkup April 12, physicians found the
president has an early stage of glaucoma. If untreated, glaucoma
can lead to a gradual impairment of sight that can result in
blindness.
   Lee said earlier Wednesday that ``there are no problems with the
president's vision. His vision remains excellent. But I feel that
it is prudent to have outside experts assess the treatment
strategy.''
   The president's wife, Barbara, also is under treatment for
problems that have interfered with her vision. She has Grave's
disease, which has caused persistent double-vision.
   Before the exam, Bush attended a 50th anniversary ceremony for
the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad near the hospital.
   In a separate outing, he visited the Capital Area Food Bank,
which collects donated food and distributes it to soup kitchens,
shelters, day-care and senior centers and other groups that help
the needy.
   It was the food bank that accepted 5 tons of broccoli shipped to
Washington after Bush declared that he didn't like the vegetable.
   ``It's nice to know that all the broccoli that my wife loves so
much found a good home,'' Bush said. ``And I'm told that it was
well-received.''
   On a more serious note, he hailed volunteers who work at the
food bank.
   ``This effort makes a difference. ... You inspire me, you
inspire my wife and you inspire the country.''

<TEXT>
   While most of Nicaragua celebrated
Wednesday's inauguration of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro as the dawn
of a new era, this Sandinista bastion lamented the demise of the
leftist revolution it embraced.
   The closest thing to inauguration festivity on Esteli's sunny
streets was Gustavo Altamirano Lanuza's tying a pole carrying the
blue-and-white national flag to one of the bars protecting his
front window.
   ``It would not be prudent to celebrate here,'' said the
62-year-old farmer and rancher, who now administers his son's
wholesale rice business.
   The night after a 14-party United National Opposition coalition
drubbed the Sandinistas in Feb. 25 elections, a mob of disgruntled
leftists stormed the campaign headquarters of the victorious
alliance.
   The one-story building, its facade painted the blue-and-white
party colors, stands along the corner from Altamirano's home.
Shattered desks, overturned benches and the charred remains of
shelves and documents litter the floor.
   ``SOB Dogs'' is scrawled in red paint across the facade.
   Esteli, 60 miles north of Managua with a population of about
120,000, was the only good-sized city carried by the Sandinistas _
but only by 200 ballots out of 40,000 cast.
   Evidence of unvanquished leftist fervor greets a visitor at
almost every turn.
   Many of the pastel-painted buildings are still pocked by
bulletholes from fierce combat during the revolutionary war. Part
of downtown was demolished by bombs and rockets delivered by
dictator Anastasio Somoza's warplanes in 1979.
   Some walls are patched. Not a few display colorful murals of
militant men and women brandishing arms, Sandinista doctors
administering vaccines, young militants teaching peasants to read
and other gains of what began in 1979 as a social experiment hailed
throughout the hemisphere.
   A block from UNO headquarters, in the state-run
telecommunications corporation office, is the ``gallery of heroes
and martyrs.''
   The photographs of 18 telephone company workers, young men and
women killed in the revolution or the war against the U.S.-funded
Contras, look down from a wall decorated with plastic flowers and
strings of Christmas tree lights.
   The largest portrait is a classic view of Argentine-born Cuban
revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara in his beret.
   Along the corner, several long-faced young men sat on a stoop
across from the firehouse. They were all Sandinistas, and though in
civilian clothes, all wore army boots.
   One had a 9mm Soviet-made automatic pistol stuck in his belt.
   ``We're determined to defend the achievements of the revolution.
But by civic means,'' said 25-year-old construction worker Oscar
Blandon.
   He said Sandinista opposition to Mrs. Chamorro's administration
would be marked by ``temperance and moderation.''
   Two women passed by wearing yellow Sandinista campaign T-shirts
bearing the obsolete slogan, ``Ganamos'' (We Win).
   ``Maybe because we in this city suffered more than anyone we've
been the ones to more completely understand what the revolution
meant,'' said Rafael Chavarria, an accountant waiting for a bus at
the central plaza.
   Chavarria, the son of peasant farmers, identified with the
Sandinistas but is not a party member.
   ``It's clear that since the revolution, more poor people have
been able to overcome their circumstances and make for themselves a
better life than their parents' lives,'' he said.
   ``Now our role must be one of constructive criticism, to call
the new government's attention to what goes wrong, but always by
civic means.''
   Altamirano, a supporter of UNO who lost land and cattle
confiscated by the Sandinistas, said it would have been nice to
have some sort of public celebration of the transfer of power.
   ``After all that would be nothing more than the exercise of a
democratic right,'' he said. ``But the important thing is not the
celebration or whether we won or lost in Esteli.
   ``What is important is that this is an historic change from a
totalitarian to a democratic system.''

   A leader in Romania's revolutionary government
complained Wednesday that Americans have been over-cautious about
investing in his country despite its offer to allow foreigners to
own all the stock in new companies they organize.
   John Manzatu is head of the Republican party and one of the
three vice-presidents of the Council of National Unity. The council
has been acting as a parliament pending an election May 20 to
choose a president and an assembly which will write a new
constitution.
   ``I'm very sorry that the United States is not as yet
involved,'' he said at a news conference. ``I want to change that
very quickly.''
   ``Romania has given up communism and socialist economies
forever,'' he said.
   The South Korean Gold Star group has made definite offers of
business projects and there has been some interest from France and
West Germany, Manzatu said
   Manzatu, a professor of biophysics and biotechnology, declined
to predict what kind of government the election will bring.
   ``We will do our best,'' he said.
   His added that his own party would go much further than the
provisional government has already done to promote private
enterprise.
   Manzatu estimated that of nearly 4 million Communist members
last fall, 80 percent had no sympathy with the party. He said he
had been a member until he was expelled in 1982, but had only
joined because he was threatened that his daughters would not get
an education unless he did.
   ``The Ceausescus _ were they real communists?'' he asked. ``They
were real thieves.''
   Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed on
Christmas Day last year.

   Oskar Lafontaine, the victim of a
Wednesday assassination attempt, is one of West Germany's most
colorful politicians and was picked to lead his opposition party in
December's national elections.
   Lafontaine has a reputation for making bold and brash statements
and seems to enjoy his role as a gadfly politician.
   He consistently argues against the large-scale NATO troop
presence in West Germany, and has long been a critic of West
Germany's policy of giving open access to East Germans.
   He has also predicted that in the future West Germans could have
a standard work week of as little as 20 hours.
   Wednesday night, Lafontaine was stabbed in the neck by a woman
who presented him with an album of poetry and a bouquet of flowers.
There was no known motive for the attack.
   The stabbing severed an artery and Lafontaine was reportedly in
serious condition in a Cologne hospital.
   Lafontaine was at the forefront of politicians who argued that
despite West Germany's wealth, the nation could not afford to
absorb the influx of the more than a half-million East Germans who
have flooded into West Germany since last fall.
   Lafontaine, unlike many other West German politicans, played
only a cameo role in the hectic campaigning before East Germany's
free democratic elections on March 18.
   His Social Democratic Party advocates gradual German
reunification and this is believed to have contributed to the
relatively poor showing of its East German sister party.
   The East German Social Democratic Party finished second in the
balloting, far behind a conservative coalition that closely follows
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's push for quick reunification.
   But a recent poll of East German voters by the West German Bild
am Sonntag newspaper this month said 46 percent of those questioned
would back Lafontaine as chancellor of a united Germany. Only 24
percent opted for Kohl.
   There has been speculation Lafontaine could unseat Kohl in the
Dec. 2 national elections.
   Lafontaine is governor of the tiny Saarland state that borders
France and Luxembourg. It is one of the poorest regions in West
Germany.
   The divorced Lafontaine is known to have an active social life,
which has featured prominently in West Germany's tabloid press.

<HEAD>Lithuania's President Says U.S. Giving in to Kremlin `Blackmail'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's president on Wednesday accused the
White House of succumbing to Kremlin ``blackmail'' by failing to
impose sanctions against the Soviet Union in response to Moscow's
economic blockade of the breakaway republic.
   ``The logic in this is hard to understand, but blackmail does
not require logic,'' the Lithuanian leader, Vytautas Landsbergis,
told lawmakers. His remarks were released by the parliamentary
press office.
   Lithuanian leaders have expressed frustration with the failure
of the United States and other Western nations to come to the
republic's aid. It has been locked in a standoff with Moscow since
President Mikhail Gorbachev rejected its March 11 declaration of
independence.
   The United States has never recognized the Soviet annexation of
Lithuania and the neighboring Baltic states Estonia and Latvia in
1940. However, it has refrained from any strong criticism of
Gorbachev's handling of the matter.
   President Bush has called for dialogue to resolve the dispute.
   In Washington, Bush responded Wednesday to critical remarks by
Landsbergis a day earlier: ``I don't need any defense.'' He said
the U.S. public supported his stance.
   The Kremlin cut off oil supplies to Lithuania on April 18, and
then curtailed shipments of natural gas and other raw materials to
try to pressure the Lithuanians into rescinding their declaration
of independence.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a member of Gorbachev's advisory board, hinted
Wednesday that some Soviet officials had sought stronger action
against Lithuania.
   ``President Gorbachev, frankly speaking, has had to restrain
many people,'' Primakov, a member of the Presidential Council, told
the official news agency Tass.
   It was not clear whether he meant the Soviet military, which has
already used force to round up Lithuanian army deserters and occupy
a printing plant.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said the republic
is trying to get around the Kremlin's cutoff of supplies by setting
up direct trade links with Soviet regions and factories, according
to spokesman Paul Pauparus.
   Lithuania produces more meat and milk than it consumes, and
Pauparus said sympathetic officials in Moscow, Leningrad and
elsewhere might be willing to barter those supplies for fuel and
other necessities.
   However, the shipments would have to travel by
Kremlin-controlled train and truck routes.
   Conditions in Lithuania, meanwhile, were said to be worsening.
   ``Lithuania's economy is on the brink of collapse,'' the Soviet
newspaper Selskaya Zhizn reported Wednesday.
   Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas estimated
Wednesday the republic's oil reserves would last until May 20. The
Soviet Union is Lithuania's sole supplier of fuel.
   Brazauskas also said shortages of grain, sugar, salt and
margarine had developed, according to Eduardas Potashinskas, a
Lithuanian activist who monitored the parliament session.
   Potashinskas said speakers at the parliament also said the
Kremlin had cut off Soviet supplies of paper and wood products to
Lithuania.
   Brazauskas suggested if the blockade continued, Lithuania should
``re-examine its policy of continuing to supply food products'' to
Soviet buyers according to existing contracts. It has already
ceased supplying cement to the Soviet Union, he said.
   In Moscow, Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov spoke informally
Wednesday with a group of Lithuanian parliamentarians and
journalists. He repeated previous Soviet demands that Lithuania
would have to repeal its independence declaration before the
Kremlin would lift its blockade, journalists reported.
   The talk took place in the lobby of the Supreme Soviet chambers
during a break in the legislative session.

<HEAD>Potter Reduces Sentence for PTL's Dortch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prison sentence of former PTL
official Richard Dortch was reduced to 2{ years Wednesday by a
judge who said he must do jail time despite testimony that sent
ministry founder Jim Bakker to prison.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter did not follow the suggestion
of Dortch's attorneys that he be placed on probation. The judge
said Dortch likely would serve from 24 to 29 months, taking into
account time for good behavior.
   Dortch had been sentenced to eight years, which meant he would
have spent from 40 to 52 months in prison, Potter said. Dortch is
currently serving his term in the federal prison at Eglin Air Force
Base in Florida.
   Dortch, Bakker's former top lieutenant at the
multimillion-dollar PTL television ministry, also was fined
$200,000 after pleading guilty to fraud and conspiracy. Potter did
not reduce the fine Wednesday.
   The judge wrote that the sentence reduction means ``Dortch will
receive due consideration for his cooperation with the government,
but simultaneously also will be required to serve a meaningful
period of incarceration.''
   ``Defendant Dortch's actions are in sharp contrast with the
actions of his co-defendant Bakker, who has refused to bring
himself to understand that he has committed the violations charged
in the indictments for which he was convicted,'' Potter wrote.
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' said one of Dortch's attorneys, Mark
Calloway. ``It was a fair and realistic reduction in the sentence.''
   Dortch and Bakker were indicted in December 1988 on 24 counts of
fraud and conspiracy for soliciting $158 million from PTL
supporters in exchange for bogus guarantees of free lodging at the
ministry's retreat in nearby Fort Mill, S.C.
   In August, Dortch entered into a plea agreement that called for
him to cooperate with the government, including testifying against
his former boss and other indicted PTL officials.
   Dortch testified at length at Bakker's trial, which began Aug.
28. Bakker was convicted in October on all 24 counts. He was
sentenced by Potter to 45 years in prison and fined $500,000.
   Bakker, 50, is serving his sentence at a medium-security federal
prison in Minnesota.
   Dortch also testifed earlier this month at the perjury trial of
former PTL pastor Sam Johnson. Potter threw the charges out, saying
the government's case was weak.
   On April 12, Dortch cried as he asked Potter to show mercy and
reduce his prison time. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller told
the judge that Dortch made ``an honest and sincere effort to be
truthful and straightforward.''
   Dortch's attorneys asked Potter to place their client on
probation. They said he has medical problems and has been spending
his days in prison handing out clothing.
   Calloway said he spoke by phone Wednesday morning with Dortch,
who asked that the attorney not describe his reaction to the
judge's order.
   ``He simply wants to serve his sentence as quietly as possible
and get on with his life,'' the attorney said.

<HEAD>Israel's Peres Says He Will Abandon Attempts to Form Government</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Wednesday
he failed in his attempts to form Israel's next government.
   Peres had been trying to put together a new governing coalition
since his center-left party engineered the collapse of a
Labor-Likud government on March 15.
   Peres' decision to abandon his attempts came after a key
prospective defector from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc said he would stay with Likud in spite of
Labor's efforts to lure him into a coalition.
   ``I have decided to go to a Likud-headed coalition,'' Economics
Minister Yitzhak Modai announced in a nationally broadcast Israel
Television interview.
   Modai blamed Labor's negotiating team, which he said torpedoed
his agreement with Peres and other party leaders.
   His statement ended two days of intensive negotiations with both
Peres and Shamir and brought Israel's two major parties back to
square one of their political deadlock. Each controls 60 seats in
the 120-member Parliament.
   Shamir's 15-month Cabinet fell last month over Likud's refusal
to accept a U.S. formula for arranging Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
   Peres had a Thursday midnight deadline for presenting a
government. He told reporters he will give back his mandate to
President Chaim Herzog.
   Herzog may then hold another round of negotiations with Israel's
political parties or immediately give Shamir the task of fashioning
a coalition.
   Peres said he doubts that Shamir would be able to form a
government, ``and if he succeeds it would be an unsuccessful
government. We talk about an extremist, right-wing government the
like of which Israel never had.''
   Likud officials said they were encouraged by Modai's decision.
   ``Mr. Peres has no possibility of forming a government. I hope
we are now beginning to get out of the political crisis and I hope
that Yitzhak Shamir would form and head a government,'' Cabinet
minister Ehud Olmert said.
   Shamir seemed less certain, acknowledging in an Israel Radio
interview that ``in a political crisis, everything is possible.''
   Israel Television said ``another political turnabout is possible
even tomorrow,'' before Peres heads for Herzog's residence.
   Labor's ruling bureau also meets Thursday, and Peres' old party
rival, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, is expected to attack Peres'
failure in coalition negotiations.
   Israeli media reports said Rabin might demand a new coalition
with Likud and even seek party leadership. Likud leaders have ruled
out an alliance with a Peres-led Labor, but did not reject a union
with Rabin, a Labor hawk.

<TEXT>
   Police in riot gear used water
cannon Wednesday to disperse hundreds of Moluccan demonstrators who
hurled bricks and firebombs at the Indonesian Embassy, Dutch
television reported.
   The report said 10 protesters were arrested and 28 police
officers injured in the clash, which came on the 40th anniversary
of a proclamation of a Republic of the South Moluccas.
   The Moluccas archipelago west of New Guinea was incorporated by
Indonesia in 1950 when the Netherlands' colonial rule over the
former Dutch East Indies came to an end.
   Moluccans maintain Indonesia illegally occupies the islands and
say the Dutch government owes them an independent homeland.
   The violence came after about 600 marchers split off from
peaceful demonstration by 1,500 people and broke through a police
cordon around the embassy, the television report said. Police had
said earlier Wednesday only several dozen demonstrators were
involved in clashes.
   At least two of the injured police officers were hospitalized,
but there was no immediate word on their condition, according to
police spokeswoman Bernardine MacLean, who said the main
demonstration was allowed to continue peacefully.
   In the 1970s, Moluccan terrorists seized the Indonesian
Consulate in Amsterdam, two trains and a kindergarten, holding
dozens of people hostage.
   There have also been several clashes with police at the Camp
Lunetten facility in Vught, where about 220 Moluccans have been
resisting eviction attempts for years.

   Gov. Joe Frank Harris defended state mental
health officials Wednesday in the case of a man who was released
from a state mental hospital the day before he opened fire in a
suburban shopping mall.
   One person was killed and four were wounded in Tuesday's attack.
   James Calvin Brady, 31, had been released from Georgia Regional
Hospital, a state psychiatric facility in Atlanta, on Monday, said
James Ledbetter, commissioner of the Department of Human Resources.
   Psychiatrists had judged that he was not harmful to himself or
others, Ledbetter said after reviewing records in the case.
   ``It looked to me like all the procedures, rules and regulations
were followed, and the clinical decision was made to release him,''
Ledbetter said.
   ``It's a very difficult decision to predict future behavior, and
that's essentially what our staff is called on to do. ... We are
not perfect,'' he said.
   Harris and Ledbetter said Brady's release was not due to
overcrowding.
   The governor said the state is ``sincere in trying ... to do
everything that we can to prevent something like this from
happening. In this case, I think it was being done.''
   The gunman, smiling and wearing a gray suit, fired a handgun
into a lunch-time crowd at Perimeter Mall. After throwing his gun
into a trash can, Brady surrendered just outside the mall's main
entrance, police said.
   DeKalb County police said the gunman carried documents from the
hospital in Atlanta, indicating he had been diagnosed as having
homicidal tendencies.
   A DeKalb County judge Wednesday ordered the mental hospital to
turn over Brady's records to police. Ledbetter said the Department
of Human Resources was seeking judicial guidance on what exactly
can be disclosed without intruding on doctor-patient privilege.
   Police said Brady was taken late Tuesday to Central State
Hospital at Milledgeville, another state-run mental facility.
   Officers said Brady bought the revolver and 12 rounds of
hollow-point ammunition, a type designed to expand on impact and
cause particularly severe wounds, for $139 Monday at Avondale Pawn
Shop in an eastern Atlanta suburb.
   Detective Lt. Rodney Maddox described the gun as ``a cut-down
barrel version of a large-frame revolver and said it ``looked
pretty worn.''
   ``How did he get the gun? Why did he get the gun?'' Maddox said.
``We don't have a good answer to that and may never know why.''
   Georgia law does not restrict the sale of handguns or rifles but
requires a license for anyone who carries a concealed weapon. Such
a license cannot be obtained within five years of release from a
psychiatric hospital.
   Harris said Wednesday the shooting spree ``makes a very strong
statement'' for stronger gun laws in Georgia, but he acknowledged
that public sentiment ``has just not risen in support enough to
pass something of that nature.''
   Rambling, disjointed notes found in the apartment Brady had been
living in said he had taken crack cocaine and then met two people
in California who created a machine that would control his mind.
   ``If I got the public at large outcry and attention of why I
became insane, the public would bring these (two people) to
accounting,'' said the notes.
   Brady was a native of Anniston, Ala. His relatives in Alabama
expressed shock over the incident. His stepmother, Sadie Bolton,
said Brady seemed fine when she last saw him around Thanksgiving.
   Brady's half-brother told The Times of Contra Costa County,
Calif., that Brady had a drug problem and was ``talking crazy''
before he left the San Francisco area two months ago.
   ``He was talking stupid,'' said the half-brother, who asked that
his name not be used. ``He said that there were some people who
were controlling this box in his stomach.''
   One of the wounded people remained in critical condition
Wednesday at Shallowford Hospital and one was in stable condition.
A third was treated and released and the fourth was expected to be
released after treatment for leg wounds.

<HEAD>25-Day Prison Siege Ends With Last Prisoners' Surrender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The longest prison siege in British
history ended Wednesday when the last five inmates at Strangeways
prison abandoned their rooftop stronghold.
   The five prisoners gingerly walked down the slippery slate roof
and stepped into a hydraulic lift that carried them the 150 feet
down to the prison courtyard, where they were taken into custody.
The surrender was shown live on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
main evening newscast.
   Prisoners had taken over the grim, overcrowded Victorian prison
in a riot that began April 1 during Sunday chapel services. About
300 prisoners overwhelmed guards, took the jail keys and released
the rest of the inmates.
   Running battles raged in the prison in northern England for
about four days and prompted unrest and violence in jails
throughout the country.
   In the weeks of negotiations that followed, inmates complained
about conditions in the prison, where they had been held three or
four to a tiny cell, allowed a shower and change of clothes once a
week and provided with a bucket instead of a toilet.
   During the siege, inmates built and rebuilt barricades and
planted booby traps to keep out authorities. But nearly all of the
1,650 prisoners had surrendered by the time more than 100 officers
in riot gear moved in Wednesday morning.
   The final five holdouts were trapped on the roof, and a sixth
inmate was captured in the sweep.
   Home Office spokesman Mike Gander said prison guards were going
through the scorched and wrecked jail to search for bodies.
   ``We are confident there are no bodies to be found,'' Gander
said.
   One prisoner died as a result of injuries in the riot, and one
prison officer died in the hospital during the riot because of an
existing heart condition. Another was slightly injured when the
facility was being retaken Wednesday.
   Home Office Minister David Mellor on Wednesday rejected
criticism of the authorities' strategy of drawn-out negotiations
with the inmates.
   ``Would you prefer that we'd knocked them off the roof and
people would have seen them falling head first down five stories?''
Mellor said in a television interview.
   The riot's apparent ringleader, Paul Taylor, 29, serving a
three-year sentence for burglary, was the last to board the crane,
fists clenched in the air.
   ``If I could get my hands on him I'd give hm a damned good
hiding,'' Taylor's grandmother, Helen Smythe, told reporters at her
home near Liverpool. ``He's been an absolute disgrace _ they should
have thrown him off the roof.''

<TEXT>
   The St. Louis Sun, which hoped to be the first
major metropolitan newspaper to make a successful launch in this
country since World War II, unexpectedly folded Wednesday after
only seven months.
   At a news conference, Ralph Ingersoll II, editor in chief of the
new newspaper, said the St. Louis Sun had published its last
edition Tuesday night.
   ``Closing the Sun was a decision the St. Louis marketplace made
for us,'' said Ingersoll. Since launching the paper Sept. 25, 1989,
the newspaper had published 213 editions.
   ``It is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation
to make this enterprise viable and so, we have concluded that there
is no longer room in St. Louis for a third newspaper in addition to
our own Suburban Journals and the Post-Dispatch.''
   The Sun struggled to overcome higher-than-expected costs,
revolving-door circulation, limited advertising and a murky image.
The newspaper also had troubles developing everyday readers.
   On April 1, the newspaper had a circulation of 109,000, up from
a low of 80,000 during the winter, aided by the start of a new
``Bingo'' promotion. Ingersoll had guaranteed advertisers
circulation of 105,000 for the first six months of 1990.
   The Sun also was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories
for its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and
of the five-year anniversary of an accident in which a man was
nearly sawed in two.
   The newspaper was further chided for running photos of new
women's swimsuits and lingerie.
   But the Sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing St. Louis'
major air carrier, Trans World Airlines.
   Some critics derided the Sun's flood of promotions, fluorescent
green billboards and contests, but Sun executives defended those
practices as the best way to encourage people to give their paper a
try.
   In making the surprise announcement, Ingersoll was flanked by
poster-size blowups of various pages of the Sun. Also on hand were
publisher Tom Tallarico, who left the Post-Dispatch to join the
Sun, and Robert Jelenic, president of Ingersoll Publications Co.
   Lorraine Orlandi, a reporter who joined the paper when it was
launched, said the 4 p.m. announcement came as a shock, and some
employees cried, but within about two hours staff members had
brought cases of beer into the newsroom.
   ``We were putting out a newspaper today. I had just returned
from City Hall with a couple of stories to write,'' Ms. Orlandi
said.
   ``The people here are not gloomy. People are in shock,'' she
said. ``There were no visible signs that we were shutting down, or
even cutting back. There were renovations going on.''
   In an interview earlier this month, Ingersoll said the two main
problems facing the Sun were higher-than-expected circulation costs
and a whopping turnover rate among home subscribers.
   Ingersoll said at the time the company had been forced to spend
$5 million more than planned to distribute the newspaper because
twice as many readers as expected wanted their newspapers delivered.
   ``Advertisers consider that to be very good, but it's much more
expensive than we planned for,'' Ingersoll said.
   But home subscribers also were cancelling their subscriptions at
an extremely fast rate, making it difficult for the Sun to sign up
enough new subscribers to keep circulation from falling.

   Go to it, O jazzmen.'' _ Carl Sandburg, ``Jazz Fantasia'' (1920).

   Dexter Gordon walked out on the stage at Avery
Fisher Hall, a tall man with a devilish smile whose body bent with
a sickly gait.
   He plugged his horn between his lips and blew reedy dreams.
   And when he was done, he accepted the applause. But not alone.
When Dexter bowed, he always stepped back and gave the stage to his
star _ his tenor saxophone. He had a way of presenting it to the
audience, like a sacred offering to a very special priesthood.
   Dexter Keith Gordon had come home 14 years after he left the
prejudices and restrictions of his homeland for Europe.
   A man of musical genius and personal humility, he died Wednesday
at the age of 67 of kidney failure.
   Like B.B. King and his sweet Lucille, Gordon's saxophone was
always his much-appreciated co-star. With it he helped define and
refine an important musical legacy: bebop.
   As the last of this century's great saxophone geniuses _ Lester
Young, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane _ Gordon had a reputation as a
strikingly original jazz soloist. The style he developed had a
strong influence on younger saxophonists of the '60s and '70s and
is influential even today.
   But as important as he was to jazz, he never placed himself
before the music. The bebop he championed may have been brash, but
Gordon wasn't. He embraced humility.
   ``One of my greatest compliments came in 1982 when he said I was
his favorite guitarist,'' said Kenny Burrell.
   ``He was an amazing personality. He was a good person,'' said
drummer Art Blakey, who had played with Gordon back in the '40s
with Billy Eckstine's band. ``I'd see him and I'd say, `Come on up
here and stand by my big cymbal. Don't just be a silent movie
star.'''
   There was nothing silent about his horn. What he spun out was
the stuff of which dreams were made. And Gordon was a dream
merchant of sorts.
   Listen to the breathy sax pulls on the moody ballad ``Who Can
You Turn To.'' Or the sensual underpinnings and samba chases of
``Manha de Carnaval.'' Finger-pop and toe-tap to the cool
smoothness of ``Coppin' the Haven.'' Enjoy the lively cool of
``Tanya.''
   ``He was something else. He had a style of his own,'' Blakey
said.
   Gordon came along at a time when the icon of the tenor sax was
Lester Young, whose lyrical style was the starting point for
up-and-coming horn players including Charlie Parker. But Gordon
carved a new approach for the tenor sax and influenced many of
Young's proteges _ John Coltrane, Stan Getz, Sonny Stitt.
   Gordon assimilated Parker's musical inventions and added his own
furious harmonics and multitextured tones. Sonny Rollins and
Coltrane used Gordon's style as a base and created their own. Years
later, Gordon updated his own sound by learning from them.
   ``Dexter Gordon was one of the pioneers of the modern
saxophone,'' Burrell said. ``His distinct and very personal style
plus his strong knowledge of music caused him to be both an
influential figure among saxophonists and an inspiration to many
other musicians.
   Gordon at an early age went to jazz concerts with his father,
who was Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton's doctor. When he was 13,
he became to study music theory and clarinet. At 15 he switched to
alto sax, studying with Lloyd Reese, who had taught the
bassist-composer-pianist Charles Mingus. Two years later, Gordon
was performing in night clubs on tenor sax.
   He traveled a rough and craggy road. There was booze _ lots of
it. There were too many drugs. There was jail.
   But the anguish with which he lived in no way diminished the
sweetness that came from his saxophone. Nor did it intrude upon his
unblinking love of jazz.
   When he was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987 as best actor
for his portrayal of a tragic jazz musician in Bertrand Tavernier's
``Round Midnight,'' Gordon responded to the news like a high school
jock who'd been made quarterback. He had been watching the
``Today'' show with his wife, Maxine, and his stepson while on
vacation in Cuernavaca, Mexico.
   There were giggles and one-word punctuations. Wow. Yeah. Awright.
   ``The film was dedicated to Bud (Powell), and I broadened that
concept to include Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins ... and people like
that who were expatriates, including myself,'' he said at the time
in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``That's why I broadened the character as much as I could to
touch as many people as possible. I wanted to open up my world to
them and make them aware of all the giants and unsung heros of the
past they weren't aware of.''

   Leftist guerrillas blew up a bridge near a
northern town Wednesday, interrupting traffic on the main highway
leading from the capital to the Mexican border, an official said.
   The predawn blast broke the bridge in two and sent a pickup
truck plunging into the Nil River, but the driver was not hurt,
Communications Minister Sigfrido Mendizabal told reporters.
   The 150-foot-long bridge is near El Asintal, a town about 120
miles northwest of Guatemala City.
   On Dec. 11, the rebels blew up a 200-foot-long bridge over the
Coyolate River, on the same highway, about 60 miles from the
capital.
   The guerrillas, which have been fighting for power for more than
three decades, signed a preliminary agreement March 30 in Oslo,
Norway, with President Vinicio Cerezo's administration to start
talks on ending the war.

   Security for President Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro is being provided by a team of Venezuelan commandos
rather than Nicaragua's own security forces.
   A dozen commandos trained in the United States were sent by
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez four days ago and set up
shop in Mrs. Chamorro's suburban home, installing rocket launchers
on her roof.
   They have been providing round-the-clock security, following
Mrs. Chamorro's car in jeeps at high speed while hanging out open
doors.
   ``We have to take very good care of this lady. There are many
who don't wish her well,'' one commando told a reporter.
   Mrs. Chamorro, inaugurated president Wednesday, had her own
private security during the campaign before the Feb. 25 election.
Public security forces are run by the Interior Ministry, which was
controlled by the Sandinista party and still has many Sandinista
sympathizers in its ranks.
   The commandos are to provide security for Mrs. Chamorro for six
weeks until June 10, the date the anti-Sandinista Contra guerrillas
have agreed to disarm and disband.

<HEAD>Brother of Slain Iranian Activist Attacks Swiss Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mujahedeen leader assailed the Swiss Wednesday
for failing to prevent the assassination of his Iranian activist
brother, saying authorities were told years ago that death threats
made special protection mandatory.
   A burst of submachine-gun fire killed Kazem Rajavi when his car
was blocked Tuesday near his home at Coppet, a lakeside town seven
miles east of Geneva.
   Police said they were looking for two men who fled in a blue
Volkswagen Golf. The car was found in a parking lot near Geneva
airport six hours later, shortly after a direct IranAir flight left
for Tehran.
   Police spokesman Maurice Gehri said two foreigners hired the car
last Sunday. He declined to give details.
   Rajavi, a member of the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq resistance
movement, obtained political asylum in Switzerland in 1973 and
focused on publicizing human rights violations in Iran.
   His brother, Massoud Rajavi, is chief of the organization.
   In Bern, government spokesman Achille Casanova promised
authorities would do their utmost to apprehend the killers and have
them tried by a Swiss court. Federal police joined local
authorities in the manhunt.
   At a news conference in Paris on Wednesday, Mujahedeen Khalq
spokesman Behzad Naziri reiterated the group's claim that President
Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran ordered the assassination.
   Massoud Rajavi said he sent a telegram to Swiss President Arnold
Koller expressing ``surprise and regret'' at what he described as
``insensibility'' by Swiss authorities. He said they were warned
years ago that his brother required special protection, and he
renewed allegations that Iranian diplomats were behind the crime,
acting on Rafsanjani's direct orders.
   Kazem Rajavi's French-born widow and mother of his three
children told a news conference he fought for a ``just cause and
the fight will continue.''
   A third brother, Dr. Saleh Rajavi, a cardiologist practicing in
France, said Kazem Rajavi was ``threatened with death many times''
in the presence of others who were ready to testify.
   Kazem Rajavi fled Iran in 1957 to join the resistance against
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlevi. After the overthrow of the shah in
1979, he served for one year as head of the Iranian Mission to the
United Nations in Geneva, but broke with the new leadership when
the mujahedeen (holy warriors) went underground.
   Mujahedeen spokesman Naziri told reporters in Paris that a U.N.
human rights report on Iran was partly to blame for Tuesday's
killing.
   He said the report ``neutralized'' the crimes of the Iranian
regime and ``encouraged'' terrorism. The killing placed a ``heavy
responsibility'' on the United Nations, he said.
   Massoud Rajavi demanded Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar send a new team to Iran, accompanied by resistance members,
to reassess the human rights situation.

   The mother of AIDS victim Ryan White said
Wednesday that every family risks losing a member to the fatal
disease because sex is a fact of life.
   ``It can be your brother, your sister, your mother, your
father,'' Jeanne White, 42, said in an interview on Capitol Hill.
``It could be a loved one, a friend.''
   Mrs. White, of Cicero, Ind., said the disease is inevitable
because among the ways it is spread is through sexual contact. Her
son, a hemophiliac, died April 8 after contracting the disease
through infected blood five years ago at the age of 13.
   Ryan's funeral two weeks ago drew 1,500 friends and admirers,
including celebrity musicians Michael Jackson and Elton John.
   Ryan was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
December 1984. His court battle to be allowed to stay in public
school called attention to the plight of all AIDS sufferers.
   Mrs. White spent the day Wednesday lobbying senators for passage
of a bill that would provide $600 million to help fight AIDS. The
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee voted 16-0 to approve
the legislation on April 4 and dedicated it to Ryan.
   Mrs. White met with the two main sponsors of the bill, Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, as well as
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. She also met with other
senators, trying to get them to add their names to the bill, and
planned further meetings Thursday.
   ``I think they felt like they can relate,'' she said.
``Especially if you have kids.''
   But Mrs. White said she wants the bill passed for everyone who
has AIDS, not just children.
   ``I am in contact with a lot of gay men who have the disease, a
lot of mothers who maybe are HIV positive from their hemophiliac
husbands _ some have lost their husbands even _ and the wife is HIV
positive. I just keep in constant communication with all types of
people.''
   The disease is passed through sexual contact, through
contaminated blood and hypodermic needles and from a mother to a
child while it is still in the womb.
   ``I think AIDS is here to stay,'' she said. ``I think that,
because we would all have to quit having sex completely. I think
that's the main issue. ... Somebody is going to be giving it to
someobdy through sex. And if we don't have sex we don't have
children. I just feel this is a subject that people don't like to
talk about. It is spread that way.''
   She said Ryan harbored no ill feelings, and all he cared about
was finding a cure. But she did say progress toward fighting the
disease would have been quicker had President Reagan and his wife
met Ryan sooner.
   ``Ryan met Ronald and Nancy Reagan a week before he died,'' she
said. ``And I felt like Ryan made a very emotional impact on them.
   ``And I think had they maybe met him four years ago or three
years ago, I think they would have related more to the issue of
AIDS.''

<HEAD>Antingua Prime Minister's Son Quits Cabinet in Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eldest son of Prime Minister Vere
Bird Sr. temporarily resigned his Cabinet post Wednesday after
being accused of helping divert Israeli weapons to Colombia's
powerful Medellin cocaine cartel.
   His father said on government-run radio that Vere Bird Jr., was
stepping down as public works minister pending completion of a
judicial inquiry. The son has denied any wrongdoing.
   The scandal has plunged the government into one of its worst
crises since Bird, 80, first came to power in 1956 on this tiny
Caribbean island, 250 miles southeast of Puerto Rico.
   The announcement followed an emergency Cabinet meeting in which
ministers discussed a diplomatic letter from the Israeli government
linking 54-year-old Bird Jr. to the arms shipment made a year ago.
   A copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press and
the letter was also read on the radio.
   It said Bird Jr. ordered Israeli-sold weapons delivered here
last year for use by the Antiguan Defense Forces.
   He assured Israel the weapons ``will not be passed, sold or
given to use to any third party,'' according to the letter.
   Despite the commitment, Israel said, the weapons ``were found in
the possession of private individuals in other countries.'' The
letter was dated April 23 and delivered to Antigua through the
Israeli Embassy in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic.
   Bird Jr. ordered the weapons in his capacity as minister of
national security, according to the Israeli letter. His Public
Works Ministry, however, gives him no responsibility for national
security.
   Investigators have placed no money value on the arms shipment.
   The letter did not state the ultimate destination of the
weapons, but Colombia says they wound up in the hands of the
Medellin cartel. The cartel's bombings and shootings have killed
hundreds of people since the Bogota government began a crackdown
last August.
   According to Colombian authorities, soldiers found 232
Israeli-made weapons during a February search of Colombian ranches
seized from Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a major drug trafficker killed
in December in a gunbattle with police.
   The weapons included assault rifles, shoulder-fired rockets and
infrared night scopes, the Colombians said.
   A preliminary investigation found the arms shipment passed
through Antigua on April 24, 1989, and arrived in Colombia five
days later.
   The twin-island state of Antigua-Barbuda, with a population of
80,000, gained independence from Britain in 1981.

   A former member of a religious cult
tearfully admitted Wednesday that he switched on a chain saw to
mask the sounds of a family of five being bound and shot.
   Gregory S. Winship, 29, made the admission during a plea bargain
hearing in which he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors _
including turning over notes he kept of cult activities.
   Winship had faced a trial set for Monday on five counts of
complicity to aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping.
   Under the deal, if he is a cooperative witness in upcoming
trials of other cult members, including leader Jeffrey Lundgren, he
will be sentenced on guilty pleas he will enter to five counts of
complicity to murder.
   All 13 members of the cult have been indicted for either killing
or complicity in killing the family.
   Winship, of Independence, Mo., was freed on a $150,000 surety
bond. He had been held in Lake County Jail since he was extradited
from Kansas City in February.
   Lake County Prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette said Winship was a
Lundgren follower from 1986 through at least April 18, 1989, when
the cult fled the county.
   ``I think it's fair to say he took extensive notes during the
course of the classes that were conducted by the group,''
LaTourette said. ``It's more a collection of loose leaf pages that
contain what was talked about, who was present, the Scriptures that
were used during each class.''
   Investigators in January, acting on a tip, found the bodies of
Dennis Avery, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their daughters, Trina,
15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 7, buried in a barn in Kirtland, about
30 miles east of Cleveland.
   All five had been bound with duct tape and shot.
   The barn is on a farm once rented by Lundgren, a defrocked lay
minister for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints. Authorities say Lundgren was a domineering, fundamentalist
leader of a cult that lived as a commune on the farm.
   Lundgren, who faces trial July 9, is charged with five counts of
aggravated murder, five counts of kidnapping and one count of
complicity to attempted aggravated murder. The last charge stems
from an alleged plan to kill worshippers of his former church.
   Lake County Common Pleas Judge Paul H. Mitrovich asked Winship
to explain his role the day the Avery family died.
   In a near-whisper, Winship replied: ``I assisted Mr. Lundgren,
who was in the barn, by doing whatever he told me to do _ namely,
that being, operating a chain saw just outside the barn to muffle
noise.''
   ``And what was done by Mr. Lundgren at the time while you were
operating the chain saw?'' Mitrovich asked.
   ``The murder of Dennis Avery was committed, sir,'' Winship said.
   He made similar statements for each of four other counts of
complicity to murder, each pertaining to another Avery family
member.
   LaTourette said complicity to murder carries a possible sentence
of 15 years to life in prison. Complicity to aggravated murder
carries 20 years to life.
   Co-defendant Richard Brand, also 26 and also of Independence,
pleaded guilty March 7 to five counts of murder and agreed to
testify for the prosecution. He had been charged with five counts
each of aggravated murder and kidnapping.

<HEAD>Judge Sets $100,000 Bond for Son of Former Panamanian President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate set bond at $100,000
Wednesday for a former Panamanian president's son who is charged
with threatening to kill President Bush.
   ``This is a serious, serious offense,'' said U.S. Magistrate
J.Q. Warnick, ending a two-day detention hearing for Otto Lakas.
   Prosecutor Paulina Jacobo, contending Lakas is a risk to leave
the country and a threat to Bush's life, said she would appeal the
bail decision. Lakas must remain in jail until the appeal has been
heard, Warnick said. Officials in the U.S. attorney's office did
not immediately know the hearing date.
   The Secret Service arrested Lakas on April 17 after he was
quoted telling a local pawnbroker he was planning to ``blow Bush's
(expletive) head off.''
   The 21-year-old architecture student at Lubbock Christian
University is the son of Demetrio B. Lakas, who was president of
Panama during 1972-78.
   He was indicted Tuesday on a charge of threatening to kill the
president. If convicted, he faces a 3-year prison term or a
$250,000 fine, or both.
   After posting bail, Lakas must pay for and wear an electronic
tracking device to monitor his location in Lubbock, Warnick said.
And if any one under Secret Service protection comes to Lubbock
while Lakas is free on bail, he will be confined to a local
Salvation Army halfway house, Warnick said.
   Lakas has no previous criminal record, police said.
   Tommy Turner, Lakas' attorney, said he was disappointed with the
decision.
   ``This whole thing is ridiculous,'' Turner said Wednesday. ``I
am satisfied the judge listened to our case and judged fairly. But
the underlying facts in this case illustrate that this was not a
serious threat.''
   Lakas told The Associated Press on April 19 he ``was not
serious'' when he told Lubbock pawnbroker Stacy Nichols that he
``had a bullet with Bush's name engraved on it.''
   Warnick listed five presidents' encounters with assassins during
his lifetime and recent threats against some U.S. judges to
substantiate his argument that ``this is a very serious matter.''
   Lakas' brother, Basilio, who flew to Lubbock from Panama City
for the hearing, testified Wednesday his brother was ``incapable of
shooting anybody.''
   ``Sometimes Otto shoots his mouth off,'' Basilio Lakas
testified. ``Once he said he was going to `kick Noriega's butt,'
but he wasn't serious.''
   Gen. Manuel Noriega was removed from power in Panama during a
December invasion of the country by U.S. troops.
   Stacy and Tracy Nichols, twin brothers who help manage their
parents' Exect Pawn Shop, said they talked to Otto Lakas April 4
for more than three hours while Lakas considered buying a
.357-caliber revolver.
   Stacy Nichols said Lakas voiced anger about the invasion of
Panama, for which he blamed Bush.

   Marimba music blared from
loudspeakers. The former first lady wore a baseball cap. And the
new president made her entrance to a hail of water balloons.
   The inauguration of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, held in a
Managua baseball stadium Wednesday, was hardly a solemn and
decorous affair of state.
   The scene was 21,000-seat Rigoberto Lopez Perez stadium, named
after the poet who assassinated the first of the Somoza family
dictators.
   Sandinista loyalists filled the stands between center field and
the third base line. Wearing the party's colors of red and black,
the Sandinistas cheered representatives of nations like Cuba and
the Soviet Union, while booing envoys of disliked nations.
   ``Assassin, assassin,'' they chanted when Vice President Dan
Quayle went by. El Salvador's rightist president, Alfredo
Cristiani, got the same greeting.
   Outgoing President Daniel Ortega entered on foot, along with his
wife, poet Rosario Murillo, who was dressed in skintight denim
pants, high boots, a red and black shirt, huge silver earrings and
a red baseball cap.
   Partisans of the United National Opposition pelted them with
watermelon rinds and blue-and-white UNO flags, and police quickly
charged into the stands. Mrs. Chamorro, still on crutches with a
broken knee, entered five minutes later, standing in the back of a
white pickup, dressed in white.
   Sandinista crowd lobbed water-filled plastic bags at the
silver-haired widow, drenching several of her police escorts and
splattering her skirt.
   The 60-year-old president dodged the missiles, kept her footing
and waved as her truck reached friendly territory, the side of the
stadium where a mass of blue-and-white UNO and national flags waved.
   Applause rang out as she made her way up the stairs to the
ceremonial platform, a crutch under one arm and her hand on the
railing, and took her place beside Ortega.
   The stadium began filling hours before the ceremony began under
a hot blue tropical sky. With marimba music going full blast, the
Sandinistas chanted militaristic party slogans.
   Finally, a Sandinista waving a huge party flag dashed onto
center field, to cheers, whistles and applause. Several UNO
supporters, in turn, made a dash for center field with their flags.
They were tackled by police.
   Riot police streamed out and took up positions on both sides of
the field about an hour before the dignitaries began arriving.
   However, the carnival atmosphere calmed when Mrs. Chamorro began
her speech.
   As she spoke, the Sandinistas fell silent, and many quietly
filed out of the stadium.

   A con man who has admitted repeatedly lying to
prosecutors and judges testified Wednesday that the accused gunman
in a Brooklyn racial killing admitted committing the crime while
they were in jail together.
   Robert Russo testified he was in protective custody at the
Brooklyn House of Detention with Joseph Fama in September when the
19-year-old murder defendant told him about killing 16-year-old
Yusef Hawkins.
   ``He said he popped him because he was a nigger. Fama said he
popped him _ Hawkins,'' Russo testified, under questioning by
Assistant District Attorney Edward Boyar.
   Russo said another murder defendant, Keith Mondello, also told
him about the incident when they met in jail. But because Russo was
called as a witness against only Fama, Justice Thaddeus Owens of
Brooklyn state Supreme Court would not permit Russo to repeat
Mondello's alleged statements.
   Another inmate, Charles Brown, testified last week that Fama
also confessed to the killing to him.
   Fama and Mondello, also 19, are being tried on murder and other
charges for the Aug. 23 slaying of Hawkins in the Bensonhurst
neighorhood of Brooklyn. The black youth was murdered when he and
three friends, also black, crossed paths with a mob of whites
wielding basebll bats in the mostly white neighborhood.
   Fama is accused of being the triggerman while Mondello allegedly
was the ringleader of the attacking gang.
   One of the teen-agers with Hawkins, Claude Stanford, 18, told
the jury, ``All of a sudden we were surrounded by some guys,'' many
carrying bats.
   Stanford said he didn't see the gunman, but he said Mondello,
whom he picked out of a lineup a few days later, was standing
before him with a bat.
   Under questioning by Fama defense lawyer David DePetris, Russo,
a cocaine user who has been in and out of jail since 1972, admitted
to being a career confidence artist and to repeatedly lying to
judges and prosecutors to get out of jail.
   ``I have a problem that I turn to conning when things get
rough,'' Russo said.
   Russo, sentenced last fall to 4{ to 9 years in jail on robbery
charges stemming from a scheme in which he persuaded taxi drivers
to give him cash to invest, said he hoped to cut his jail time by
testifying against Fama.
   He said he ran his schemes to cover a $100 to $200 a day cocaine
habit, and while in jail often provided information to law
enforcers.
   At one point, when DePetris showed scorn for him, Russo said:
``Did you expect an angel to sit on this stand?''
   Russo said he easily gained the confidence of Fama and Mondello
because he grew up in Bensonhurst and knew some of the same people
they knew.

<HEAD>Angola, UNITA Say Peace Talks Are Set</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angola's foreign minister on Wednesday
announced his government would soon begin direct peace talks with
the UNITA rebels.
   Pedro Van Dunem said the talks would begin within a few days,
but that the exact dates or location had yet to been agreed upon.
   ``We are convinced the talks will help us find the path to
national reconciliation in Angola,'' he said.
   A UNITA spokesman in New York, Abel Chivukuvuku, described the
planned talks as preliminary and said they were likely to take
place in Lisbon, where a UNITA team was already in place.
   Angola gained independence from Portugal in November 1975.
   Van Dunem complained the United States and South Africa were
resupplying the rebels with logistical aid, weapons and ammunition,
and warned that such aid could hamper the talks.
   But Aubrey K. Dwyer, spokesman for the South African mission,
said South African aid to the rebels had stopped under a 1988
agreement.
   ``So far as we know factually, we are not giving any physical
support to UNITA,'' he said by telephone.
   UNITA spokesman Chivukuvuku also denied the Angolan assertion of
fresh South African military aid being given to UNITA, which is the
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total Liberation
of Angola.
   The Angolan minister also said Cuban troops, which had fought
UNITA rebels for years, were being withdrawn on schedule. He said
more than 35,000 had left and about 15,000 remained.
   He said Angola's leftist government was instituting major
economic and political reforms, including implementing the
market-oriented economic prescriptions of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
   The minister also said Angola was laying groundwork for free
general elections, and that the creation of separate executive,
legislative and judiciary branches was under discussion.

   After years of delay and a
last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the
shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight,
drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
   Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of
the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting
one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
   ``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at
330 nautical miles above the Earth,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey
Carr said.
   ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Discovery commander Loren J.
Shriver said later.
   The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the
shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one
orbit later than planned. The shuttle then backed away.
   ``Thank you very much for the ride,'' said Mike Harrington,
director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had
been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the
solar panel. That proved to be unnecessary.
   ``Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the
way it did,'' Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained for
nearly five years to make such a rescue mission.
   The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday
as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles,
above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to
the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of
charge.
   Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more
troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches were first released,
then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again.
A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
   ``Houston, we see motion,'' Commander Loren J. Shriver reported.
   Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after
7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long
mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high
above the shuttle.
   Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was
lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own
nickel-hydrogen batteries.
   ``At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble
is now on its own internal power,'' Carr said. ``The game has
begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.''
   Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for
electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
   Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it
was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting
off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope.
   Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher
than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need
to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
   Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
   ``I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board
astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks
far away today,'' Shriver said of Hawley.
   Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place
in space. The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in
1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it
back.
   The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power
unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before
April 10's scheduled liftoff.
   On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting
Hubble out of this world and in search of others.
   The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday,
exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open
properly. If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be
prepared once again to walk in space.
   Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would
be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture
door is opened.
   ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said.
   The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the
sensitivity of its five instruments.
   If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
   NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope _ of
an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ on Tuesday. Data
will follow in a month or two.
   Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the
time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. They expect to determine
precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was
expanding. He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang
theory of creation.

   ABC's new low-rated ``Capital News'' and
``Sunset Beat'' are being taken off the air for a ``hiatus,'' but
there will at least one more ``Elvis'' sighting next month, ABC
said Tuesday.
   ABC's shuffle of the shows, all of them midseason replacements,
came a day before the start of the key April 26-May 23 ratings
``sweeps'' that help determine advertising rates for local
television stations.
   ``Sunset Beat,'' about undercover cops in Los Angeles, got the
hook after only one broadcast, its premiere Saturday. It will get
one more showing this Saturday, with its future to be announced
later.
   It will be replaced on May 5 by two half-hour episodes of the
low-rated ``Elvis'' series based on the early career of Elvis
Presley. That new show was yanked by ABC last month when it failed
to hold its strong Sunday lead-in from the hit ``America's Funniest
Home Videos.''
   ``Capital News,'' a Washington newspaper series that premiered
April 9, will leave ABC's schedule after its broadcast next Monday.
A film comedy, ``Ruthless People'' will replace it May 7. The
two-hour movie also will preempt ``China Beach'' that evening, ABC
said.
   The network will say later what will replace ``Capital News'' on
Mondays, said ABC spokesman Tom Mackin. He said the show will
return at a later date. Four episodes will have been shown when it
leaves the schedule. Nine more episodes have been filmed.

<HEAD>Brazil Announces Plan to Cut Gov't Employees, Sell Public Property</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government announced Wednesday that
it will fire thousands of public workers and sell off hundreds of
official mansions, apartments and vehicles.
   The month-old administration of President Fernando Collor de
Mello, trying to slash hyperinflation and a huge government
deficit, already has drastically limited bank withdrawals and plans
to sell billions of dollars worth of publicly owned businesses.
   Secretary of Administration Joao Santana said the reforms, made
out of economic necessity, will save Brazil $860 million this year.
However, it is only half the cuts Collor promised during his
campaign.
   Santana told a news conference the government identified 11,354
workers holding more than one public job, accounting for 25,740
federal positions.
   They will have 30 days to justify their situation or lose at
least one of their jobs, he said.
   Santana said the government expected to save $34 million a month
by doing away with double job-holding, bonuses for top employees
and high-security job categories.
   The reforms are the most radical in Brazil's history. They are
aimed at reducing a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy and cutting
expenses considered largely responsible for Brazil's 2,700 percent
inflation last year.
   Santana, who is in charge of the reform program, also said 23
state companies were being eliminated and 12,000 workers with less
than five years on the job would be fired.
   Congress has approved the cuts.
   Brazil has more than 700,000 federal employees. A new
constitution enacted in 1988 gives workers job stability after five
years.
   The government also announced the sale of nine mansions and
9,391 apartments that were reserved for ministers and high
functionaries, as well as 2,500 cars and planes, tugboats and 350
dredges.
   Santana said the money saved could pay for 87,000 low-cost
houses, or pay the salaries of 151,775 teachers or 88,000 doctors.
   But, he added, ``the government must eliminate its budget
deficit, and these funds will enter the National Treasury to cover
gaps.''
   The savings from the austerity measures still are far below what
Collor promised when he took office Mar. 15. He predicted spending
cuts of $1.75 billion, equal to about 2 percent of Brazil's $350
billion gross domestic product.
   The next step in the government's plan is a National
Privatization Program that calls for the sale of many of Brazil's
188 state companies, which have a combined debt of $62 billion.
   The Brazilian Congress has authorized the sale of most
government companies except for the oil monopoly Petrobras, the
postal service, the telecommunications giant Embratel, development
banks and the Bank of Brazil, the country's largest commercial bank.
   Foreign capital can acquire only 49 percent of stock in
``privatized'' companies and 33 percent of voting capital.

Says</HEAD>

   Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said
Wednesday the United States is obligated to remain strong
militarily because of the Soviet Union's past abuses of power and
uncertainty over its commitment to reform.
   ``The new openness has not yet transformed hope into the reality
of a freer government,'' Cheney said. ``And that reality is what we
need to see, to allay the fears of the rest of the world about the
Soviets' enormous military power.
   ``Until that happens _ until we are confident that Moscow will
not again use its military capability to conquer and intimidate _
Soviet glasnost will only be a partial answer to our defense
concerns,'' said Cheney, addressing the American Newspaper
Publishers Association's annual conference.
   He said that Moscow's response to Lithuania's fight for
independence is a ``lead indicator'' of future Soviet developments.
   ``If the solution that ultimately develops is based on peaceful
action, not coercion ... then confidence in Soviet reform will
grow,'' Cheney said. ``But we will draw very different conclusions
if this issue is resolved by military force and intimidation _ the
tactics of empire and not of reform.''
   Cheney, after giving a litany of past Soviet aggressions, said
he remains skeptical about Soviet intentions.
   He said that despite Soviet promises to reduce troops, nearly a
half-million Soviet soldiers remain in Eastern Europe.
   He cited a report from a group of Soviet officials this week
that the CIA had underestimated the percentage of Soviet GNP
devoted to the military.
   ``They said the CIA was overly optimistic about developments
inside the Soviet Union. It seems to me I've had the same
problem,'' he said.
   Cheney acknowledged that reforms are under way, but he said the
``transformation of Soviet society is just beginning.''
   ``Overall, the world is looking for open political arrangements
among the peoples of the Soviet Union based on democratic values,
not coercion,'' he said.
   The Bush administration, optimistic that such change is
possible, is working with the Soviet Union to reduce strategic and
conventional armaments and restructure U.S. military forces to
lower defense costs, Cheney said.
   ``But we have to remember that there is a point below which we
can go and still provide the global defense we need in the years
ahead,'' he added.
   ``Security threats were not invented by the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union, and threats will remain long after that party has
gone out of business,'' Cheney said.

   A judge rejected a motion Wednesday to dismiss
murder charges against a man accused of torching an illegal social
club and killing 87 revelers.
   Defense attorney Richard W. Berne had asked for the dismissal on
grounds that he had not had access to a videotaped statement taken
from Julio Gonzalez by police before a grand jury indicted him.
Gonzalez has pleaded innocent to 174 counts of murder.
   State Supreme Court Judge Burton R. Roberts rejected Berne's
motion and set May 30 for Gonzalez' next court appearance, when it
was expected that a psychiatric report would be available.
   Gonzalez, 36, has been held in a prison ward at a psychiatric
hospital since his arrest in the pre-dawn fire that killed 87
people at the Happy Land social club March 25.
   He faces charges of murder by arson and murder by depraved
indifference for each of the victims, plus two counts of arson and
one count each of assault and attempted murder.
   Police say Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant, admitted setting the
fire after an argument with a former girlfriend who worked at the
club. She was one of five people known to have escaped the fire.
Most of the victims were Honduran immigrants.
   Meanwhile, a group of Hondurans said they would appeal to
Roberts to reconsider his position that Gonzalez, a Cuban
immigrant, could draw only one maximum 25-year-to-life sentence
even if convicted on all counts. That could make him eligible for
parole in 25 years.
   Roberts has said New York law provides for concurrent rather
than consecutive sentences in cases where multiple deaths result
from one criminal act.
   ``We feel that this is too narrow an interpretation of the
law,'' Jose Velasquez, a civil engineer, said outside the courtroom
after Wednesday's hearing.
   Velasquez said a petition drive among an estimated 50,000
Hondurans living in the city would be conducted by a newly formed
group calling itself the Federation of Honduran Organizations in
New York.

   A newspaper has pulled advertisements featuring
Polish leader Lech Walesa speaking in broken English after Mayor
John O. Norquist and others complained the ad amounted to an ethnic
slur.
   The Milwaukee Journal used newspaper, television and radio
advertisements featuring Walesa and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher to promote the newspaper's new page designs, unveiled this
month.
   The Walesa newspaper advertisement shows a photo of the Nobel
Prize-winning founder of Poland's Solidarity movement with the
words: ``Very long I have hoped for changes so significant as those
in new Milwaukee Journal.''
   The Thatcher ad pictures the prime minister with the words ``Why
yes, the American colonies have progressed. Consider the recent
changes in your Milwaukee Journal.''
   Both ads involved contrived quotes.
   Robert Dye, spokesman for the Journal, said the ads were
intended to be ``lighthearted spoofs'' and both were pulled this
week.
   ``I guess it just didn't click,'' Dye said. ``It didn't have the
impact we intended. The original intent was that it be fun. As soon
as we realized it wasn't working, we pulled the ads.''
   The quarter-page Walesa ad ran in Monday's Journal editions. It
drew an immediate letter from Norquist, who complained the use of
the broken English ``shows an obvious lack of respect for Walesa
and for Polish culture.''
   ``I'm sure that since English is not his native language, he
probably does not speak it as well as you do,'' Norquist wrote to
Journal Editor Sig Gissler. ``At the same time, I wonder how well
you speak Polish.''
   The head of the city's annual Polish ethnic festival charged the
television advertisement featuring Walesa was even more degrading
to Poles.
   ``I thought it rather demeaning to the Polish ethnic groups,''
said Richard Gralinski, executive director of Polish Fest. ``I
certainly thought it was an ethnic slur.''
   Milwaukee, a city of about 600,000 people, has more than 180,000
residents of Polish ancestry, Gralinski noted.

<TEXT>
   While poachers have decimated wild
animals throughout most of Africa, a crackdown on illegal hunters
in Uganda has boosted herds of elephants in wildlife sanctuaries,
the government said Wednesday.
   The elephant population in Ruwenzori National Park has swelled
from 450 three years ago to 700, Uganda National Parks director
Eric Edroma told reporters. The reserve was home to 3,000 of the
animals in the 1960s.
   After Uganda's independence from Britain in 1962, government
troops, guerrillas, poachers and hungry villagers combined to
slaughter thousands of pachyderms throughout the country, Edroma
said.
   Most were gunned down when former dictator Idi Amin ruled the
east African nation from 1971 to 1979, mainly by soldiers with
machine guns who smuggled the ivory to the Middle East and Asia.
   By 1980, a year after Idi Amin was toppled in a military coup,
only 150 elephants were roaming Ruwenzori park in western Uganda.
   When President Yoweri Museveni seized power in 1986, he vowed to
protect wildlife and mounted a nationwide sweep against poachers.
   Today, apart from 450 elephants that remain within the
1,200-square-mile sanctuary, 250 migrants divide their time between
Ruwenzori and the Virunga National Park in neighboring Zaire.
   The elephant population throughout the continent has plummeted
from 1.5 million in 1978 to as few as 400,000 because of widespread
poaching, often with the connivance of politicians, bureaucrats and
security chiefs.

   Arab diplomats asked Cyprus' Parliament
on Wednesday to restrict Soviet Jewish emigrants from using Cypriot
ports as they travel to Israel.
   A government announcement said the heads of Arab diplomatic
missions in Cyprus called on Vassos Lyssarides, president of the
House of Representatives, to protest the use of the island as a
transit point for Soviet emigrants.
   Lyssarides is serving as acting president until President George
Vassiliou returns from a trip abroad.
   Also Wednesday, several Greek Cypriot newspapers criticized the
government for not ending the travel.
   ``How can we appeal for international support against the
colonization of our land by Turkey, when we ourselves facilitate
the colonization of the occupied territories of other states,'' the
right-wing Agon wrote.
   The northern section of Cyprus is occupied by Turkish troops,
and thousand of mainland Turks have been moved into the area.
   The newspapers also said the government was risking terrorist
attacks by Arab groups that have threatened to strike against
facilities used by Soviet Jewish immigrants on their way to Israel.
   In a press statement issued Monday, the Arab diplomats aluded to
terrorist threats made by Arab extremist groups, which have
threatened to attack facilities and carriers used by the Soviet
immigrants.
   The diplomats ``expressed surprise at the facilities offered by
Cyprus to the Soviet immigrant Jews,'' particularly in view of the
``dangers they pose to its national security.''
   Cyprus has stepped up security precautions at both Larnaca
airport and the port of Limassol.
   The Soviet embassy's press attache in Nicosia, Vladimir Chizhov,
told a press conference Tuesday that Soviet Jews travelling to
Israel via Cyprus were tourists with return tickets.
   He said some did stay on in Israel, but added that the Soviet
Union could not restrict their freedom of travel.
   Hundreds of Soviet Jews have been arriving at Larnaca the past
few weeks aboard Soviet Aeroflot jets. They complete their journey
to Israel by sea from Limassol.
   Larnaca has long been used as a stopover by Soviet tourists
arriving in Israel to visit family. There is no direct transit
between the Soviet Union and Israel.
   The inflow has sparked an outrage in the Arab world, which fears
that some of the newcomers could settle in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank or Gaza Strip and that the mass immigration will
strengthen the Jewish state.
   Monday, Israeli officials said that 25,000 Soviet Jewish
immigrants arrived this year. Israeli officials say the number is
expected to reach 100,000 by the end of the year.
   Only about 200 Soviet immigrants have settled in the occupied
territories.

   A DC-3 plane carrying 22 passengers
and crew crashed Thursday near a military cemetery in Manila,
killing at least six and injuring 16, officials said.
   The aircraft crashed near the Hero's Cemetery at Fort Bonifacio,
headquarters of the Philippine army. The cemetery is the burial
place for Filipino war heroes and other prominent national figures.
   The sprawling military complex also includes housing for
soldiers and a U.S. military cemetery.
   Diosdado Santarin, a spokeswoman for the airport emergency
services, said some of the victims may have been residents of
military housing areas near the cemetery.
   Santarin said the propeller aircraft, owned by the private
Manila Air Transport System, reported engine trouble shortly after
takeoff from Manila airport and tried to make an emergency landing
at the military complex, a few miles northeast of the civil airport.
   The aircraft was headed for Roxas, 250 miles southeast of Manila.
   Pilot Anastacio Maravilla, who suffered minor injuries, told a
local radio station he could not return to the airport for an
emergency landing due to poor weather conditions and because the
plane was losing power too quickly.

<TEXT>
   The St. Louis Sun, which hoped to be the first
major metropolitan newspaper to make a successful launch in this
country since World War II, unexpectedly folded Wednesday after
only seven months.
   At a news conference, Ralph Ingersoll II, editor in chief of the
new newspaper, said the St. Louis Sun had published its last
edition Tuesday night.
   ``Closing the Sun was a decision the St. Louis marketplace made
for us,'' said Ingersoll, who is also chairman and chief executive
officer of Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll Publications Co. Since
launching the seven-day morning tabloid Sept. 25, 1989, the
newspaper had published 213 editions.
   ``It is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation
to make this enterprise viable and so, we have concluded that there
is no longer room in St. Louis for a third newspaper in addition to
our own Suburban Journals and the Post-Dispatch,'' Ingersoll said.
   The Sun struggled to overcome higher-than-expected costs,
revolving-door circulation, limited advertising and a murky image.
The newspaper also had troubles developing everyday readers.
   The decision to stop the presses was made Sunday, Ingersoll
said, but apparently few people knew until hours before the news
conference.
   He said the closure, which will cost 194 employees their jobs,
stemmed from a failure to build single-copy sales through vending
machines and retail outlets, and wasn't based on any pressure from
advertisers or investors.
   ``It had nothing to do with money, you'll have to take my word
for it,'' Ingersoll said. ``It had to do with single copy sales.''
   The Sun is owned by Ingersoll Newspapers, which owns 77 other
papers and is part of Ralph Ingersoll II's newspaper holdings.
   On April 1, the newspaper had a circulation of 109,000, up from
a low of 80,000 during the winter, aided by the start of a new
``Bingo'' promotion. Ingersoll had guaranteed advertisers
circulation of 105,000 for the first six months of 1990.
   The Sun also was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories
for its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and
of the five-year anniversary of an accident in which a man was
nearly sawed in two.
   The newspaper was further chided for running photos of new
women's swimsuits and lingerie.
   But the Sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing St. Louis'
major air carrier, Trans World Airlines.
   Some critics derided the Sun's flood of promotions, fluorescent
green billboards and contests, but Sun executives defended those
practices as the best way to encourage people to give their paper a
try.
   In making the surprise announcement, Ingersoll was flanked by
poster-size blowups of various pages of the Sun. Also on hand were
publisher Tom Tallarico, who left the Post-Dispatch to join the
Sun, and Robert Jelenic, president of Ingersoll Publications Co.
   Lorraine Orlandi, a reporter who joined the paper when it was
launched, said the 4 p.m. announcement came as a shock, and some
employees cried, but within about two hours staff members had
brought cases of beer into the newsroom.
   ``We were putting out a newspaper today. I had just returned
from City Hall with a couple of stories to write,'' Ms. Orlandi
said.
   ``The people here are not gloomy. People are in shock,'' she
said. ``There were no visible signs that we were shutting down, or
even cutting back. There were renovations going on.''
   In an interview earlier this month, Ingersoll said the two main
problems facing the Sun were higher-than-expected circulation costs
and a whopping turnover rate among home subscribers.
   Ingersoll said at the time the company had been forced to spend
$5 million more than planned to distribute the newspaper because
twice as many readers as expected wanted their newspapers delivered.
   ``Advertisers consider that to be very good, but it's much more
expensive than we planned for,'' Ingersoll said.
   But home subscribers also were canceling their subscriptions at
an extremely fast rate, making it difficult for the Sun to sign up
enough new subscribers to keep circulation from falling.
   William Woo, editor of the Post-Dispatch, said the Sun had set
out on a difficult mission.
   ``We are saddened for the people who worked hard at the Sun and
we are saddened for those in St. Louis who depended upon the
paper,'' Woo said in a statement. The Post-Dispatch's circulation
is about 375,000 Monday through Friday, and 565,000 on Sunday.
   The announcement came five days after Ingersoll had a setback in
his effort to resolve problems with junk-bond debt at another of
his companies, Community Newspapers Inc.
   Ingersoll offered to buy back at cut-rate prices more than half
of the company's $240 million in junk bonds, which it used for
expansion. But no bondholders signed up to sell their bonds back to
Ingersoll, even though the bonds have been trading at an even lower
price, about 40 cents on the dollar, than what he offered.
   If the company can't agree with bondholders on a buyback, it
could be forced to more than double the interest rate on some of
the bonds this June to a rate of more than 26 percent.
   Ingersoll said those problems were unrelated to the Sun.

   Princeton University students ended a
32{-hour occupation of President's Harold Shapiro's office
Wednesday after officials agreed to expand programs dealing with
sexual harassment and assault.
   University officials refused to meet the specific demands of the
30 students who invaded the office early Tuesday. But they agreed
to devote more resources to expand the programs to include graduate
students.
   If the counseling center needs more staff to do so, the
university will provide it, Vice President Thomas Wright said in a
statement.
   The students had demanded that center staff be doubled to three
full-time therapists.
   ``The administration is delighted that we've resolved this issue
without violent confrontation ... without having to result to the
use of force,'' said Princeton spokeswoman Jacquelyn Savani.
   The university also agreed to create a task force to design the
new programs, and to hold a forum in the fall to address the
center's needs.
   The protesters say 208 students sought counseling at the center
during the 1988-89 academic year, up from fewer than 50 the year
before.
   Wright had said Tuesday that the administration could not
increase funding for a program in the middle of the school year.
   He told the students to follow formal channels and appeal to the
Priorities Committee, which meets in the fall and makes budget
recommendations for the following school year.
   The students said conventional channels had provided little
satisfaction.
   Shapiro left his office shortly after the students arrived at
about 9 a.m. Tuesday, officials said. He then left campus for
several days of meetings in Washington.
   Talks between the students and other officials deadlocked
Tuesday. About 50 student sympathizers held an all-night vigil
outside the building, said student spokesman Matthew Polly.
   The Sexual Harassment@Assault Advising, Resources and Education
center serves about 2,300 students, largely new freshmen.
   According to its annual report, of the 208 people who sought
counseling during the 1988-89 school year, 71 said they were
victims of sexual harassment or assault, incest or violence within
a relationship.
   In all but eight cases, the victims were women. In all but one
case, the alleged assailants were men.

   About 100 convicts at Sofia's central
prison and dozens of prisoners in other cities ended a weeklong
standoff after officials promised reform and freed some people held
in investigative custody, the Justice Ministry said Wednesday.
   Two Sofia inmates were hospitalized after trying to set
themselves on fire last week, but no other injuries were reported.
   Angel Djambozov, first deputy minister of justice in charge of
prisons, said seven Sofia prisoners still refused to get off the
roof eight days after the protest began, the state BTA news agency
reported.
   Some inmates had threatened suicide if their reform demands were
not met.
   About 80 inmates had climbed onto the prison roof in Pazardjik,
60 miles east of the capital, on April 17. BTA said 52 ended their
protest voluntarily and the other 30 were ``returned to their
cells.'' It did not elaborate.
   Similar protests reportedly began the same day in Varna, Plovdiv
and Vraca.
   Djambazov said the prison strikes were settled without violence,
BTA said.
   The ministry official said seven people were released from Sofia
prison because they were kept longer than the prescribed six months
for investigative custody.
   Djambozov told a news conference he would visit all of
Bulgaria's prisons as part of a plan to improve living conditions
and solve other problems, BTA reported.
   The government has begun instituting reform since hard-line
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted in November after 35
years in power.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge whose colleague was
assassinated last year was being driven to work by U.S. marshals
when the car's rear window shattered, launching a police sweep that
found it was likely an accident.
   The sedan was carrying 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
J.L. Edmondson from his suburban home to the Atlanta court around
8:30 a.m. when the rear window broke, authorities reported.
   No one was hurt, and after several nervous hours investigators
said it was likely that no one was meant to be, despite initial
police reports that someone had fired a gun at the car.
   ``There is no reason for anyone to assume at this point there
was any effort to injure the judge,'' said Stephen Boyle, spokesman
for the U.S. Marshals Service in Washington. ``There is no evidence
to suggest there was a projectile of any sort intended to cause
harm.''
   Investigators surmised that a defective window simply shattered,
or that an abrupt temperature change in the car broke the glass.
   Security has been tight around 11th Circuit judges since Judge
Robert Vance, of Alabama, was killed Dec. 16 by one of four mail
bombs sent to judicial and civil-rights targets in the Southeast.
The U.S. Marshals Service has been escorting the judges to and from
work.
   On Dec. 18, another of the mail bombs killed a Savannah civil
rights attorney, Robert Robinson.
   Soon after the car window broke Wednesday, Gwinnett County
police spokesman Larry Walton reported that an ``unknown
individual'' had ``apparently ... shot at the vehicle'' as it
rolled through the city of Lawrenceville.
   A helicopter began searching, and Lawrenceville Police Chief
Robert Sutton said officers had converged on a possible suspect in
a nearby subdivision.
   Police cordoned off and swarmed into the area, alarming local
workers, but found no suspect.
   And at midday, federal investigators said they had been unable
to confirm that any object was fired at the car. FBI spokesman Dan
Eramian in Washington said no projectile was found in or around the
vehicle.
   ``Police were on the roof, everywhere _ 20 to 30 of them,'' said
Rita McMahon, an employee at the Finamart store a block away from
where the window broke.
   The judge's car pulled into the parking lot of a nearby county
school system building, and police ordered employees not to leave
the area, said schools spokeswoman Berney Kirkland.
   And workers locked themselves in an office in nearby Button
Gwinnett Hospital, where spokesman Gary Morris said police and news
helicopters were landing and taking off all morning.

<TEXT>
   Inspired by Henry David Thoreau's 19th-century
homage to Walden Pond, a group of celebrities launched an
international fund-raising campaign Wednesday to buy historic land
slated for development around it.
   The leader of the group, singer-songwriter Don Henley, displayed
a check for $250,000 in announcing plans to save Walden Woods, the
once-unspoiled forest that Thoreau retreated to more than 130 years
ago to write his classic ``Walden.''
   Seated in two neat rows at historic Faneuil Hall and sipping
individual bottles of Evian water were such celebrities as Don
Johnson, best known for his role as a cop on ``Miami Vice,'' Ed
Begley Jr., who recently played a philandering husband in the film
``She Devil,'' Bonnie Raitt, whose latest hit is titled ``Thing
Called Love,'' and Dana Delany, who plays the tough Army nurse on
``China Beach.''
   ``When I was 17 and went to school in Andover, I went to Walden
Pond and went skinny dipping there,'' said Delany, dressed in a
black leather jacket and black stirrup pants. ``I was
understandably aghast when I heard what was happening there.''
   ``Henry David Thoreau was 150 years ahead of his time,'' said
the 42-year-old Henley, wearing a suit with a slicked back ponytail
and glasses. ``His writing presaged the environmental movement and
it seems appropriate to save his lands.''
   The money was raised from ticket sales to two concerts headlined
by Henley, Raitt, Bob Seger, Glenn Frey, John Cougar Mellencamp and
others at the Worcester Centrum this week.
   Henley organized the benefits after seeing a report on Cable
News Network earlier this year about the proposed development of a
condominium project and office park near Walden Pond.
   The plan of the Walden Woods Project is to raise the estimated
$8 million needed to buy the lands from developers Mortimer
Zuckerman and Philip De Normandie. Henley said Wednesday that
Zuckerman has donated $100,000 to the project.
   The celebrities' plan also calls for the construction of
affordable housing farther away from Walden Woods.
   Others involved in the project include Michael Kennedy, son of
the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and co-chairman of the Walden Woods
Project with Henley, novelist E.L. Doctorow, former U.S. Sen. Paul
Tsongas, and various state officials and environmental leaders.
   ``These places of refuge are going to become paramount,''
Johnson said. ``It's up to us to take a stand if we're going to
have a place to go and contemplate and know the Earth as it once
was.''
   Doctorow, author of the best-selling ``Ragtime,'' said:
   ``Thoreau was an Everyman and he chose Walden to be his
Everywhere. Walden is a book that could only be written by an
American. We wouldn't exist as a people without this book. We have
to be able to say, `you read the book, now see the place.'''
   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre state
reservation on the edge of Concord, an affluent town of 12,500
about 20 miles from Boston.
   The pond, however, is far less pastoral than when Walden lived
by its shore in a tiny shack in 1845. It lies less than a hundred
yards from a highway and is adjacent to a garbage dump.

<TEXT>
   Sixty-two pounds of plutonium lodged
in the air ducts at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant could
cause a radiation leak that could kill some workers, plant
operators say.
   But the conditions under which that could happen are unlikely to
occur, and EG&amp;G Inc. is working to eliminate all risk of such an
incident, said Phil Warner, Rocky Flats manager, on Tuesday.
   More than 100 people packed into a meeting of the Rocky Flats
Environmental Monitoring Council to hear Warner discuss the
plutonium, which has accumulated in the ventilation ductwork at the
plutonium processing buildings.
   Warner said plant officials haven't decided whether to remove
the plutonium, or when the plutonium processing operations at the
plant will resume.
   ``The plutonium is contained within the pipes,'' Warner said.
``When you start talking about removing it, there's the possibility
of plutonium getting in the atmosphere in the building. Removing
ducts is not easy.''
   Rocky Flats, which is operated by EG&amp;G for the federal
Department of Energy, manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons. Plutonium processing operations were shut down at the
plant last fall so EG&amp;G could implement new safety and
environmental monitoring programs.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins has said he wants the operations
to resume by the end of June.
   The plutonium buildup in the air ducts was discovered during a
survey of the plant.
   Federal investigators have said employees using gloveboxes to
manufacture plutonium triggers often bypassed air filters or poked
holes in them rather than change them in order to get more work
done. That practice allowed plutonium dust to escape through the
filters into the air ducts, they said.

   Oscar-winning actress Elizabeth
Taylor nearly died of pneumonia last weekend, but is responding
well to treatment, although ``she is not out of the woods,'' her
doctor said Wednesday.
   A biopsy revealed that the 58-year-old Academy Award-winning
actress has viral pneumonia to which she is responding, Dr. Bernard
Weintraub, a pulmonary specialist.
   ``She is awake and alert and progressing nicely at this time,''
he said.
   Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, told
reporters Miss Taylor was pleased her physicians took her off a
ventilator that had been aiding her breathing.
   ``She was very happy the tube was out,'' Murray told reporters
at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center. ``She said she'd come out
and wave to you but she's not in her balcony attire.''
   Weintraub said he believed Miss Taylor would survive.
   ``I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I
believe that has now passed,'' Weintraub said. But, he added, ``She
is not out of the woods.''
   Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9
for what was described as a persistent fever and sinus infection.
When her condition worsened, she was transferred April 16 to St.
Johns.
   In a statement after arriving at St. Johns, the actress denied
rumors that she was suffering from an AIDS-related condition.
   ``There was no suggestion of either cancer or infections
commonly seen in AIDS,'' Weintraub said.
   Miss Taylor was moved to the intensive care unit of St. Johns on
Friday, her physicians said.
   With the actress Wednesday were her four children, Maria
Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding.
Also present were several close friends, Weintraub said. The
friends were not identified.
   The hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's behalf
thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters during her
hospitalization.
   ``Since she was admitted to St. Johns on April 16, Miss Taylor
has received many letters and cards from supporters, and along with
her family appreciates their prayers and concern,'' the hospital
said.
   Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,
particularly recurring back troubles from the filming of the 1945
movie ``National Velvet,'' when she fell off a horse.
   In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and pain killers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
   Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse problems
at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.
   During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylor
underwent a tracheotomy, in which an incision was cut into her
windpipe to help her breathe. She appeared at the 1961 Academy
Awards with a bandage over her tracheotomy scar as she accepted her
Oscar for ``Butterfield 8.''

   On the eve of her inauguration,
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro infuriated leaders of
her political coalition with her apparent decision to retain the
Sandinistas' longtime military chief.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, a leader of the Sandinista revolution, is
to stay on for a time to promote reconciliation between the
pro-U.S. administration and the leftists who ruled Nicaragua for a
decade, an administration source said.
   Nicaragua is emerging from nine years of civil war that claimed
30,000 lives and left the economy in tatters, and Mrs. Chamorro has
promised its 3.5 million people peace.
   But by keeping outgoing President Daniel Ortega's brother at the
helm of the military, Mrs. Chamorro could be making it more
difficult to persuade the U.S.-supported Contra rebels to disarm.

   The Bush administration is ruling out any
immediate warming of relations with Syria despite a courtesy call
by President Bush and an official pat on the back for assisting in
the liberation of U.S. hostage Robert Polhill.
   ``While Syria has taken certain positive steps since 1986 to
combat terrorism, including its role in the release of Mr. Polhill,
we continue to be very concerned about the presence in Syria and
Syria-controlled areas of terrorist groups,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday.
   The groups include Ahmed Jabril's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine _ General Command, suspected in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988 in which 270 people were
killed; the Japanese Red Army and the Abu Nidal organization, Ms.
Tutwiler said. The first has its headquarters in Damascus; the
other two are in the Bekka Valley of Lebanon.
   ``Syria's current relations with these groups is an impediment
to better U.S.-Syrian relations,'' the spokeswoman said.

   Home ports under construction in New York,
Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Washington state are among 34
military installations the Navy is considering for possible closure.
   A three-page list of Navy recommendations for closure,
realignment and consolidation surfaced Tuesday during a hearing by
two House Armed Services subcommittees.
   The list drew immediate criticism from a lawmaker who released
the document, and a Navy statement that it was a preliminary
compilation and not a ``hit list.''
   The Pentagon ``politically wants us to open and close bases at
the same time,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., who opposes
continued spending on new home ports nationwide.

   After more than 50 years, the United States is
ready to pursue normal diplomatic relations with Albania despite
its reputation as one of the world's most rigid police states.
   The State Department responded favorably on Tuesday to a
statement last week in which Albanian President Ramiz Alia
expressed interest in establishing diplomatic ties. He made the
same overture to the Soviet Union.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, in a statement,
referred only indirectly to Albania's human rights record.
   ``Establishment of diplomatic relations would create the
opportunity for dialogue through which we would be able to
communicate our concerns and encourage respect for human rights in
Albania,'' she said.

   Toss out those boring ball gowns, tedious bows,
gargantuan shoulder pads and thigh-high hemlines. Style 1990 is
sumptuous but simple, sedate without being dated.
   ``When the world is feeling quiet, like it is when it has a lot
of things to address, designers are feeling that, too,'' said Andy
Basile, vice president and fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman.
   Fashion experts say designers reflect the national mood,
particularly the current economic climate, in the clothes they
make. That means a return for fall to more classic looks customers
are sure to want.
   ``There is a certain nervousness about what will sell because of
the retail environment and economic times,'' said Patrick McCarthy,
executive editor of Women's Wear Daily. ``People are playing it
safe.''
   In their fall 1990 collections, presented in recent weeks in
Seventh Avenue showrooms and ritzy hotel ballrooms, designers
sought to strike a balance between safe and special. The result was
a quieter look.
   The fabrics are sumptuous, both in their richness and their
simplicity. Beaded and sequinned silks parade alongside cashmeres
and wools that look soft enough to swaddle a baby. The line is
clean and minimal. The silhouette is kind to the body _ not too
tight and not too loose.
   In his show in the Plaza Hotel's ornate ballroom, Oscar de la
Renta said goodbye to the ball gown. Instead, he showed long
evening skirts with multicolored jeweled jackets, simply cut from
dazzling rich fabrics.
   Collection colors include greens and gold, but no loud neon-sign
hues here. Hemlines show the knee, but the legs are covered in
hosiery the same color as the outfit, unitards, tights or leggings.
   A favorite theme running through the shows was a touch of
evening elegance in day wear, and sporty day accents for night.
   Donna Karan jazzes up daytime cashmeres with black sequin
scarves. Her basic unitard becomes a sexy evening outfit when done
in velvet and worn under a sheer, floor-length organza blouse.
   The blurring between day and night has a very practical side. A
little mixing and matching makes an item of clothing wearable
around the clock.
   Designers also have latched onto outdoor wear, like parkas and
anoraks, and transported them from ski slopes and fishing streams
to exclusive Upper East Side restaurants and Metropolitan Opera
openings.
   De la Renta showed a quilted floral silk parka striped in gold
over a silk charmeuse blouse and multicolored sequinned skirt.
   Calvin Klein, a master of quiet, understated clothes, came up
with lots of turtleneck sweaters worn over short skirts with
tights. One of his best was a forest green fisherman's sweater with
a spruce and black plaid wrap skirt and loden and gray shawl.
   In her review, Bernadine Morris of The New York Times called his
collection, ``quiet, wonderful and just about perfect.''
   But WWD gave him a ``B'' in its review and commented, ``It's ..
. unfortunate that Calvin, one of America's most important and most
prosperous designers, plays it so safe.''
   No one could have been bored at the Geoffrey Beene show. Beene's
sculpted clothes are pared down to the simplest shapes, perfectly
proportioned. His streamlined catsuits, two-piece tweed suits and
long monastic dresses are accented by triangular inserts,
asymmetrical belts, stand-up collars and slim leather halters that
slip over one shoulder.
   His colors, often somber, can be vibrant. A high-collared,
long-sleeved monastic gown is regal in a floral pattern of hunter
green and gold.
   The result is ultramodern clothing that would be at home in a
Star Trek vessel.

<HEAD>Revision Of Broadly Endorsed Bible Out In May</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.''
So reads Exodus 11:8 about Moses in the Revised Standard Version of
the Bible. A new, clearer rendering reads, ``And in hot anger he
left Pharaoh.''
   That's a sample of the clarifying changes made in the New
Revised Standard Version reaching bookstores in May after 15 years
work by an interfaith team of Scripture scholars.
   Seeking greater accuracy, clarity and more natural, intelligible
and flowing English, the revision refines phrasing in what has been
America's most broadly endorsed version of Scripture, the RSV.
   That 38-year-old version holds approval of most major
Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations. It's
the first version to gain that common acceptance, says the Rev.
Gerald Knoff, veteran Christian educator.
   The revision of it, the NRSV, produced by a 30-member group of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars,
draws on older original manuscripts for correctness and also
sharpens the English wording.
   ``Those that were sent went,'' reads Luke 19:32 in the old RSV,
but the NRSV puts it more smoothly, ``Those who were sent
departed.''
   An instance of greater precision is Amos 6:5, which in the old
wording cites those who ``like David invent for themselves
instruments of music.'' Now, it says those who ``like David
improvise on instruments of music.''
   The Rev. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton Theological Seminary, the
courtly and learned Bible scholar who headed the translation team,
calls the new version both ``the newest and oldest.''
   He said the aim was to be ``as literal as possible'' in adhering
to the ancient Hebrew and Greek texts but also ``as free as
necessary'' in making the meaning clear in graceful, understandable
English.
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also sparked production of the RSV in 1952. The
translation team worked without charge, unlike translators of many
other versions.
   Six different publishing companies are putting out various
editions of the revision, some including the deutero-canonical or
apocryphal books between the Old and New Testaments, as wanted by
some denominations.
   The Rev. Arthur O. Van Eck, head of the council's division of
education, calls the new revision a ``Bible for our time.''
   In keeping with growing liturgical usage, the revision replaces
the former uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God with
``you.'' Metzger noted the original texts use the same pronoun in
addressing God and people.
   Despite some pressures for more sexually inclusive terms,
Metzger said that was done only when the text allowed it concerning
people. Pronouns remain masculine in referring to God and Jesus.
   There was ``no tampering with the gender of deity,'' Metzger
said. ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the `Son of
God'.''
   However, he said English, unlike Hebrew and Greek, lacks a
common-gender, third-person pronoun, leading to a masculine bias to
male pronouns about people in past translations although the
original text is more inclusive.
   For instance, in the RSV, John 2:l0 reads, ``Every man serves
the good wine first,'' but the text doesn't specify ``man''.
Consequently, the revision reads, ``Everone serves the good wine
first.''
   Other corrections of unnecessary masculine renderings include
Matthew 4:4, which in the RSV reads, ``Man does not live by bread
alone.'' ``One'' replaces ``Man'' in the revision.
   In the Song of Solomon, Metzger said that in the sentence, ``I
am black but beautiful,'' the conjunction, ``and'' replaces
``but,'' which had implied black isn't beautiful.
   He said the change also conforms with the usual translation of
the Hebrew word,``wa'' which 49 out of 50 times is translated as
``and,'' not ``but''.
   Samples of other changes:
   Deuteronomy 29:5 _ RSV _ ``Your sandals have not worn off your
feet.'' NRSV _ ``Your sandals have not worn out on your feet.''
   Hebrews 11:16 _ RSV _ ``God prepared for them a city.'' NRSV _
God prepared a city for them.''
   Psalm 50:9 _ RSV _ ``I will accept no bull from your house.''
NRSV _ ``I will not accept a bull from your house.''
   First Samuel 24:11 _ RSV _ ``Though you hunt my life to take it.
..'' NRSV _ ``Though you are hunting me to take my life...''
   Second Corinthians 6:11 _ RSV _ ``Our mouth is open to you,
Corinthians; our heart is wide.'' NRSV _ ``We have spoken frankly
to you Corinthians; our heart is wide open to you.''
   Psalm 98:8 _ RSV _ ``Let the hills sing for joy together.'' NRSV
_ ``Let the hills sing together for joy.''

<TEXT>
   The voice was reedy, high-pitched, solemn. It
belonged to Abraham Lincoln, delivering his first inaugural
address, trying desperately to preserve a union. But the sentiment
could come these days from Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``In your hands (said Lincoln addressing the South, or could say
Gorbachev, addressing Lithuania) and not in mine, is the momentous
issue of the civil war. The Government will not assail you. (But) I
hold that, in contemplation of universal law and the Constitution,
the Union of these States is perpetual. ... No state, upon its own
mere action, can lawfully get out of the Union.''
   The parallel _ between Lincoln, seeking to preserve the Union,
and Gorbachev, seeking to preserve the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics _ has occurred. At least, it occurred to Yuri A. Reshetov.
   He runs the Soviet Foreign Ministry's department for
international humanitarian cooperation and human rights. At a news
conference on April 9 he sought American forbearance by comparing
Lincoln's and Gorbachev's struggle to preserve their unions.
   Reshetov said he had visited the Lincoln Memorial the previous
day.
   ``Abraham Lincoln saved the American Union,'' he said. ``We (the
Soviets) have been together with Lithuania, with Estonia and with
Latvia for many, many years,'' he said. ``I still hope that what
unites us is much stronger than what is capable of leading to
dissolution of our union.''
   All of which draws a deep, hooting laugh from Harold Hyman, a
Rice University professor and expert in both constitutional and
American Civil War history.
   ``Let me call it a strained analogy, a kind of twistery instead
of history,'' says Hyman.
   Says Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau, a constitutional historian at the
University of Louisville, ``I appreciate his position but I think
his analogy is unhistoric. ... He is obviously grasping.''
   William M. Wiecek, son of an immigrant, professor of law and of
history at Syracuse University, attacks the analogy most succinctly.
   He points out that the original 13 states of the American union
voluntarily formed and ratified the union and the other 37 states
petitioned to be admitted.
   Lithuania, by contrast, was taken over by the Russians under the
terms of a secret pact between Stalin and Hitler, which Wiecek
calls ``one of the most loathsome agreements of modern times.''
   In both instances, the people of the seceding entity, through
their elected representatives, voted to secede. However, in the
case of the South, no one polled the vast numbers of residents who
happened to be black and in bondage. Those who held the whip were
those who had the vote.
   And yet, Wiecek is willing to grant Gorbachev _ and Reshetov _ a
point: the Soviet leader perhaps has the right and duty to try to
oversee a smooth secession rather than a chaotic one.
   Says Wiecek: ``As a historian, it is always misleading to argue
from parallels drawn from completely different civilizations. With
that qualification in mind, I think there is something to be said
for the Soviet official's idea in the sense that the chief
executive officer of any modern state has a responsibility, if not
to prevent secession, at least to manage a change in relations so
that the interests of the state itself and the seceding entity are
preserved.''
   ``What would George Bush do,'' he asks, ``if Alaska attempted to
secede?''
   So the Reshetov attempt to bend American history into a Soviet
parallel doesn't work, but anarchy doesn't work either.
   No one, not Soviets, not Lithuanians, not Americans, wants to
see the price _ half a million lives _ that was paid on American
soil to establish the anti-secessionist principle that Lincoln laid
down and Reshetov would adopt as his own.

<HEAD>Milken: Prison, but No Paparazzi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By pleading guilty to financial crimes, Michael
Milken has exposed himself to years in prison but avoided another
ordeal _ a daily run through the gantlet of cameras outside
Manhattan's federal courthouse.
   ``He's always hated to have his picture taken,'' says Allan
Sloan, a financial columnist who has spoken with Milken many times.
``It's not really a phobia. It's part of his control thing.''
   If so, the prospect of following in the steps of Leona Helmsley,
Imelda Marcos, Bess Myerson and other celebrities who have stood
trial in New York must have seemed particularly depressing.
   Because there are only a few routes into the courthouse,
criminal defendants must pass a battery of cameras each day.
Although some enjoy it, for most ``It's a pain in the neck,'' said
Jules Ritholz, a prominent defense lawyer.
   Milken's suspicion of the lens is considered legendary. It is
said that he steadfastly refused to be photographed for Drexel
Burnham Lambert's annual report, even though he created and ran the
firm's vaunted junk bond department.
   He also sought to control who photographed him, how the photos
would be shot and where they would go. When photographer George
Steinmetz arrived at Milken's Beverly Hills office in 1987 to shoot
the financier, he was handed a contract giving Milken all rights to
the photos. Steinmetz signed it.
   That was only the beginning, Steinmetz later recalled in an
interview with The New York Times.
   ``I wanted to shoot him at his desk, surrounded by all his
traders. But they said they didn't want others to be in the
picture. So I suggested photographing him alone at his desk in the
morning before anyone came in. They said that would make him look
too much like a loner.''
   Steinmetz's request for a photo of Milken arriving at work in
his chauffeured car was rejected because it would make the
financier look too pampered. So finally the photographer had to
settle for a picture of Milken outside his house posed awkwardly in
a staged game of basketball with some neighborhood kids.
   In 1987 Sloan, then a writer at Forbes magazine, got an
interview with Milken. But getting a photo to accompany the article
was something else.
   ``We had endless trouble over it,'' Sloan recalls. ``We couldn't
buy any pictures because he had all the rights. Finally I had to
call him up and ask him (to cooperate.) I spent an awful lot of
time trying to get a photo.''
   Milken's indictment and his required appearance before a
congressional committee ended the photo famine. He also appeared at
a few flattering photo opportunities arranged by his public
relations consultants, but ``you could see he hated doing it, and
he wasn't good at it,'' Sloan says.
   To placate the hordes of paparazzi still clamoring for his
visage, Milken allowed a photographer to shoot a set of official
photos, which were made available to the news media.
   Still, Milken's distaste for photography certainly was no help
to his lawyers as they negotiated a pretrial settlement with
prosecutors, legal experts said.
   ``Fear of photography is one of about 40 reasons why you don't
want to go to trial,'' says Ritholz. ``You've got to factor it into
your decision.''
   ``But I wouldn't make too much of that,'' said Stephen Gillers,
a New York University law professor. ``I don't think someone is
going to make a plea bargain decision based on his dislike of being
photographed. You'd have to be Howard Hughes, and I don't think
Milken's in that league.''

<HEAD>IRA Trick: Roll Over and Play Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Need cash fast? Borrow from yourself _ and pay
no interest!
   However strange that come-on may sound, the proposition it
embodies can be workable for someone who has accumulated a nest egg
in an individual retirement account.
   But beware. Like many other types of short-term, emergency
financing, it can be a tightrope walk that imposes severe penalties
if you take a misstep.
   The rules governing IRAs make it clear that the government
didn't intend these long-term savings vehicles as any source of
readily available credit.
   They state expressly that if you borrow from an IRA _ or even if
you pledge money in your account as collateral on a loan _ you will
be considered to have made a withdrawal subject to taxes.
   For people who have not yet reached age 59{, that usually means
a 10 percent penalty tax in addition to any regular income tax
obligations you incur.
   Elsewhere in the dense tangle of IRA regulations, however, there
is a loophole of sorts that permits people of any age to tap their
accounts, once a year, for no-interest ``loans'' lasting up to 60
days.
   When you do this, you technically do not borrow the money at
all. Instead, you withdraw it from an account with one custodian to
roll it over into another, with a time limit of no more than 60
days from the date when you receive the money from the first
custodian.
   Before your time runs out, what you do with the money is up to
you _ buy a car, take some speculative fling, whatever you wish.
   Of course, if you want to preserve your hard-earned IRA savings
and avoid costly tax bills, you need to be very sure that you will
be able to pay yourself back in time.
   ``The device of `borrowing' from an IRA should only be
considered in situations where it is clear that the funds will be
available to complete the rollover within the 60-day period,'' says
the Research Institute of America in a current bulletin on the
subject.
   The institute suggests that it may not be assurance enough to
simply have what businesses call an account receivable _ a payment
somebody owes you that may or may not come in on schedule.
   Theoretically at least, you could take your IRA money to the
bank and buy a 58-day certificate of deposit, pocketing whatever
interest the CD earns, and then put the principal amount back in a
new IRA.
   But if the bank's payment to you got held up for just three days
or so, because the mail wasn't delivered or the computer went down,
you'd be out of luck. The IRS takes the position that the time
limit is a time limit, leaving little or no room for excuses or
exceptions.
   This IRA-to-CD-to-IRA deal would also have a couple of other
angles you might want to take into account.
   First of all, the CD interest, unlike investment income earned
in an IRA, would be subject to current taxation. Secondly, while
you had the use of the money, it wouldn't be earning anything at
all for your IRA savings.
   On top of all that, while avoiding taxes in an IRA rollover you
could incur other costs, such as withdrawal fees at the old
custodian or setup fees at the new one, that would work against any
net benefit to you.
   Considering all the pitfalls involved, many IRA savers might be
reluctant ever to plan an actual rollover to get at their cash. At
the same time, however, they might view it as a nice cushion to
have in reserve.

   America ``has slipped into moral

Force in urging widespread observance of the day Thursday.
   This is the 38th consecutive year for the National Day of Prayer
since Congress authorized it in 1952. In 1988, Congress set a
permanent date for it on the first Thursday of May each year.
   The task force, headed by actor Pat Boone and Mrs Bill Bright,
wife of the leader of Campus Crusade for Christ, urged prayers of
thanks for ``blessings our country has received'' and for
``personal and corporate renewal of moral values.''

<HEAD>New Rendering of Widely Used Bible Version Now Ready</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An interfaith team of Scripture experts led by a gentle-mannered
Princeton scholar has worked for 15 years producing what's likely
to become the most widely used Bible in American churches.
   The New Revised Standard Version, put out by six publishers in
various editions, is being distributed in May to bookstores. It has
been authorized and commended by most of the nation's major
denominations.
   ``It offers greater accuracy, clarity and naturalness of
expression,'' said the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger, chairman of the
30-member translation committee that turned out the new rendition.
   Drawing on older, more exact manuscripts and changes in meanings
of current English, the work is a fine-tuning of the Revised
Standard Version, completed in 1952, and the most broadly endorsed
version in the years since.
   Metzger, 76, a Presbyterian and courtly, zestful Scripture
scholar of Princeton Theological Seminary, applied this rule in the
new rendering of the ancient texts: ``As literal as possible, as
free as necessary.''
   That demanded that the content adhere to what the original
Hebrew and Greek manuscripts actually say, while phrasing it in
understandable and graceful English.
   ``We never tampered with meanings,'' Metzger said in an
interview. But many archaic usages and sometimes ambiguous or
obscure passages are clarified in the revised translation.
   For example, Zechariah 3:3, previously rendered as ``Now Joshua
was standing before the angel, clothed in filthy garments,''
becomes: ``Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood
before the angel.''
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also holds the copyright on the predecessor RSV,
endorsed by most major Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches.
   Despite the contemporary proliferation of Bible translations,
Metzger said the RSV has been the mostly widely used ``modern
speech translation.'' In its 38 years, it has sold more than 45
million copies.
   Revising of it was done by a translation committee of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars.
   Biblical scholars these days ``approach each other in terms of
scholarshilp,'' not denomination, Metzger said. ``There's a
homogeneity in biblical scholarship the likes of which we had not
seen before.
   ``The differences are in theology, not in biblical studies.
Irrespective of denominational affiliations, matters of theological
interpretation fall into the background. So far as the book goes,
we are essentially one.''
   Most teams producing Bible translations are paid for their work,
but the NRSV group labored at their task since 1974 without pay or
share in royalties. It's ``a contribution'' to the churches,
Metzger said.
   Formal publication date and church celebrations of it were
scheduled in September, but a May 1 start was authorized for
distribution to stores.
   While some feminists pressed for more sexually inclusive
language in the new translation, Metzger's criteria required
adherence to the texts. However, many terms previously rendered as
male were originally inclusive.
   He said that masculine pronouns or the words ``man'' or ``men''
often were used previously in passages in which the original text
allows for more generic usage such as ``one'' or ``people.''
   For example, Matthew 6:30 previously was rendered ``O men of
little faith,'' but now is rendered, ``you of little faith.''
Metzger said the word for man wasn't present in the original.
   Similarly, John 12:32 previously was rendered, ``And I when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.'' The latter
phrase now becomes, ``...draw all people to myself.''
   However, pronouns referring to God and Jesus remain masculine.
``We were not authorized to change them,'' Metzger said, adding
that there was no ``tampering with the gender of deity.
   ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the Son of God.''
   However, uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God are
changed to ``you.'' ``In the Hebrew and Greek texts the same form
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to God and
people,'' Metzger said.
   He calls the new translation both ``the newest and oldest
version'' since the translators used ancient texts only recently
discovered, such as the Dead Sea scrolls providing much older
manuscripts of the Old Testament.
   Some previously rendered passages that sometimes drew snickers
in church readings were changed to correct possible
misunderstandings.
   For instance, Psalm 50:9, that previously read, ``I will accept
no bull from your house,'' becomes, ``I will not accept a bull from
your house.'
   Also, Paul's letter in Second Corinthians ll:25 previously read,
``Once I was stoned.'' It now reads, ``Once I received a stoning.''
   Publishers distributing the NRSV are Cambridge University Press,
Thomas Nelson Publishers, Inc., Holman Bible Publishers, Oxford
University Press, World Bible Publishers, Inc., and Zondervan
Corporation.
   In addition, the American Bible Society has been authorized to
offer the NRSV as part of its program, and Collins Ltd., is
publishing an edition in Great Britain.

<HEAD>Brazil Considers Radical Idea: Paying Bills by Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Post Office is proposing a
revolutionary idea _ that the 150 million people of Latin America's
largest country pay their bills by mail instead of standing in line.
   Brazil is modern in many ways, but you still cannot write a
check for your electricity bill, put it in a stamped envelope and
drop it in a mailbox.
   Virtually all bills are paid at banks, which are clogged with
long lines of grumbling, sweaty people holding stacks of
electricity, gas, and water bills; school, department store, health
insurance and credit card accounts, auto license fees and
statements of income or property taxes.
   A specialized commercial culture has sprouted around the
practice. Companies and wealthy individuals hire young men,
universally called ``office boys,'' to do their standing and paying.
   One company's office boy presented a check to pay the telephone
bill, but the bank insisted on cash. He went to the company's own
bank, which said it would take a check but must have a new one
naming the bank as payee. In desperation, the office boy returned
to the first bank, where the manager finally made an exception and
accepted the check.
   The Post Office wants to make things simpler.
   Its press spokesman, Jose Valfranio Medeiros de Oliveira, said
in an interview: ``There's nothing easier than paying bills by
mail, and we want to make life easier for our citizens.''
   Some newspapers have begun, rather timidly, to support the
program.
   ``Yes, there is a long tradition here of not paying by mail,''
Oliveira said, ``but we have the infrastructure, we have
credibility. There's no reason this won't work.''
   This month, he said, the Post Office will run a test program
allowing people in the northeastern state of Bahia, population 11.6
million, to pay telephone bills by mail. If that goes well, the
experiment will be extended to other states and to bills for water,
gas and federal taxes.
   ``All Brazil's 4,000-plus townships have post offices, whereas
one-third don't have banks,'' Oliveira said.
   ``In addition, there are 22,000 public mailboxes and 3,000 rural
collection points on farms and ranches. Post offices have longer
hours than banks. Some post offices are open on weekends.''
   Brazil's largest commercial bank, the government-controlled
Banco do Brasil, announced plans for a ``Citizens' Comfort,'' a
program that would allow even people without accounts at the bank
to mail it their checks for water, electricity, gas and federal tax
bills.
   Alberto Policaro, the bank president, said that would make life
easier for Brazilians and ``free bank workers from receiving bills
and let them get on with the bank's real business _ taking in
deposits and making loans.''
   Public acceptance of such a departure is far from universal.
   Luis Sant'Anna Mendes, a Rio teletype operator who used to work
for the Post Office telegraph service, said: ``I'd rather wait in
line at a bank. That way you have confirmation that you paid.''
   At a bank, you get a stub with a machine stamp showing the
amount paid.
   Oliveira said post offices could provide the same kind of
receipt. That means bill payers would have to line up at the post
office, of course, but the press spokesman said: ``Our lines move
faster than bank lines.''
   Surveys by Brazil's largest private polling company, known as
IBOPE, indicate the Post Office is Brazil's most trusted public
institution, but skepticism persists.
   ``You just don't know if the letter really will get there,''
Mendes said.
   Another problem is that Brazilian banks do not return canceled
checks; they keep check records on microfilm. In the case of a
disputed payment, the payer would have to line up at the bank to
see his account record.
   ``There are technical details to be worked out,'' Oliveira
acknowledged, ``but if you can pay bills by mail in the United
States and Europe, there's no reason you can't do it in Brazil
too.''

<HEAD>Singapore Builds More Bomb Shelters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the world plans reductions in military
spending, but Singapore, a thriving city-state with no apparent
enemies, is building more bomb shelters.
   About 200 shelters and the same number of air raid sirens will
be completed in the next year and Singapore should be ready for its
first nationwide drill in 1992, Home Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar
said.
   ``The more shelters, the better,'' he declared. ``This will mean
more protection for the public.''
   Protection from what?
   Southeast Asia has been among the world's more stable regions
recently, but government leaders insist security remains a problem
despite the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   That will not change even if the superpowers reduce their
military forces in the region, said Lee Hsien Loong, 37, eldest son
of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
   Lee addressed Parliament as second defense minister. He also has
the trade and industry portfolio and is widely viewed as a future
prime minister.
   ``If the United States significantly cuts back its military
forces in the region, this will not be a signal for Singapore also
to reduce our forces,'' he said. ``It will be reason for concern
over a potentially destabilizing change in the regional balance of
power.''
   Singapore is the only country in the region that openly backs
continued U.S. military presence. Officials in several other
capitals express private support and public non-alignment.
   ``Except for Singapore, the nations of Southeast Asia think the
American security shield will stand forever, regardless of what
they do,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, leader of a House Armed
Services Committee delegation that toured the area recently.
   ``They can boast of their non-aligned purity while reaping the
harvest made possible by the American military,'' the Colorado
Democrat said.
   If the United States cannot renew the leases on Philippine bases
and is forced to leave, it will need help from friends in the
region, she said. Singapore has offered greater access to its air
and naval facilities.
   In his speech to Parliament, Lee said the government would not
cut defense spending, reduce the armed forces or end compulsory
military training, whatever the United States did.
   Singapore is about the size of Chicago, with no natural
resources except a strategic location between the Pacific and
Indian Oceans and the skills of its 2.6 million people, 76 percent
of whom are ethnic Chinese.
   The army, navy and air force have 55,000 regulars and conscripts
plus about 200,000 reservists. Analysts rate the Singapore armed
forces among the best trained and equipped in the region.
   Because it is so small, Singapore often holds major military
exercises in Brunei, Taiwan or elsewhere.
   It conducts bilateral maneuvers with other members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations _ Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Brunei and the Philippines _ but ASEAN as a whole does
not function as a military alliance.
   ``No other ASEAN country is slashing its defense expenditures,
demobilizing its armed forces or acting on the assumption that it
no longer faces any external threats,'' Lee told Parliament. ``It
would be foolhardy for Singapore to do so alone.''
   Diplomats from ASEAN countries said the countries awaited
resolution of two regional problems: the search for a peace formula
in Cambodia and negotiations on the U.S. bases.
   Singapore is in the Five Power Defense Agreement with Australia,
Britain, Malaysia and New Zealand. The 1971 pact provides for
consultation and cooperation among members if Singapore or Malaysia
is attacked or threatened.
   Defense spending is about 6 percent of Singapore's gross
national product, which means the equivalent of $1.9 billion in the
current budget.
   U.S. defense spending in 1988 was 6.1 percent of the gross
national product, or $293.1 billion.
   Some defense funds go to a domestic arms industry that has grown
so fast it now seeks export orders and diversification.
   It was started less than 20 years ago and includes more than 40
companies under the Singapore Technologies umbrella. The
government-backed companies evolved from making small arms under
license to designing howitzers and upgrading jet fighters.
   Singapore's ``total defense'' plan was drafted in 1983, while
Vietnamese military forces occupied Cambodia, and aims to involve
the civilian population with the military in a national emergency.
   The first air raid drill sent 3,000 volunteers swarming into a
new subway station in 1988.
   Nine underground stations have been fortified to shelter 100,000
people. Shelters also are being built in schools, hospitals and
other public facilities.
   Other civil defense training covers rescue methods, blood
donation, mobilization of private motor vehicles and emergency
distribution of food and water.

<TEXT>
   Kid Sheik is one cool gent. The dark glasses
rest just so on the bridge of his nose, and his rings sparkle.
   Never mind that he's old. Just get him talking about music, or
better yet playing it, and the years slip away. He seems as young
as the notes from his trumpet.
   ``Music must keep you young. I started my first band when I was
15, started playing that horn long before that. I used to go around
to these yard parties where all the bands would be playing or down
to some music spot and before you knew it, I was hooked,'' he said.
   George Colar is 81 now and he's slowed down some, but his alter
ego, Kid Sheik, is still going strong.
   ``I drank hard in my day, but I haven't had a drink in 20 years
now. I used to smoke 15, 20 cigars a day. Not anymore. I'd be out
every night. I don't have the energy for that running around now.
My music hasn't changed though. I still have the same memories. The
same feelings. I still hear the same tunes inside,'' he said.
   The Kid Sheik Band, of which he is the leader and the youngest
member, plays two nights a week at Preservation Hall in the French
Quarter. They tour several months a year and they never miss the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   ``We were at the first Jazz Fest down in Congo Square and we
haven't missed one yet,'' he said.
   Kid Sheik, who is featured on this year's Jazz Fest Poster, will
be one of almost 3,000 musicians performing on the 11 open-air
stages during the 10-day event April 27-May 6.
   ``It's grown and that's a fact,'' he said. ``Seems like now
everyone in the world goes to Jazz Fest. People come from all over.
A lot of folks from Europe will be here.''
   This is the 21st Jazz and Heritage Festival, expected to draw
300,000 people, mostly to the fair that runs weekends at the
historic Fair Grounds racetrack in downtown New Orleans.
   The music is continuous from noon to dark _ not just the
traditional New Orleans sound that Kid Sheik plays, but Cajun,
gospel, rhythm and blues, bluegrass, contemporary jazz, African,
Caribbean and more.
   The stages and tents are separated by food booths and craft
tents, and this year the racetrack's grandstand will be opened for
special displays and events.
   Kid Sheik will play the festival on Saturday, April 28.
   He says he got his name from his style of dress. ``In my younger
days I was always a chic dresser. I was known for my chic clothes
and so they just started calling me that.''
   Never mind the spelling of ``chic.'' That was in the days when
he was out and about every night learning to play his trumpet and
having fun.
   ``There were so many greats then. Wooden Joe Nicholas, Chris
Kelly. Chris Kelly would play those blues and the women would throw
their pocketbooks at him. He'd play the blues and make you cry,''
he recalled.
   He still plays the old songs, always opens with ``Yes Sir,
That's My Baby.''
   ``It's become sort of my theme song. We play them all. You know
they call it New Orleans Jazz, but it's really New Orleans music.
It's the way we play music down here,'' he said.
   Kid Sheik's seven-piece band has been playing at Preservation
Hall since before it was Preservation Hall, he said.
   ``We used to go there and play for just what we collected. Then
the union heard about it and said, `You can't do that, they have to
get a salary.' So they started paying us, but we made less than
when we were just getting tips.''
   The band still gets tips for special requests. It's $1 for a
song, unless it's ``When the Saints Go Marching in.''
   ``We play that so much we charge more for it. That one's $5,''
he said. ``That's one reason I'm glad to see people coming to
something like Jazz Fest. I think they think all we do down here is
play `Saints' and eat red beans and rice.''

<TEXT>
   Clarence Henry was 18 years old when he sent
his tired fingers across the piano keys and told a red-eyed group
in a New Orleans night club he didn't have a home.
   ``It was back in 1955 at the old Joy Lounge,'' he said. ``I'd
been working since 7 o'clock that night and it was 7 in the morning
and I was tired. I wanted to go home. I struck a little rift and
said `I ain't got no home.' That's how I wrote the song. We
recorded it the next year right here in New Orleans and it's been
going ever since.''
   That lonely boy is 53 now and still singing, sometimes, as he
says in the song, ``like a frog.'' On Saturday, April 28, Henry
will sing ``Ain't Got No Home'' for maybe the millionth time at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   ``People always ask for it. They wait for it,'' he said of his
trademark tune. ``Ain't Got No Home'' catapulted Henry to fame and
gave him his stage name as well.
   ``I was looking for a good one,'' he said. ``I couldn't be
`Fats.' That was taken. But people would ask for the frog song by
the frog man, and this disc jockey, Poppa Stoppa, said to me
`That's your name. The Frogman.'''
   The song was featured in the movie ``The Lost Boys.''
   ``There's been millions of copies of that song sold. It still
sells today, but I'm still waiting for the money,'' Henry said.
``It's a mess. Everything's changed hands so many times I don't
know who owes me what anymore. I made a few thousand dollars on it,
but the real payoff is that it brought me fame.''
   The Frogman has performed at 20 of the 21 Jazz Fests in New
Orleans. A kind of one-man repertoire of rhythm and blues, Henry
sings many of the songs made famous by other New Orleans artists.
   During the year, he now does from 10 to 30 gigs, he said,
ranging from a New Year's Eve Party with only nine guests to
another music festival in Sweden.
   Henry toured with the Beatles on their American run in 1964.
   ``I did 18 shows with them. That was really something,'' he said.
   He played for the Rolling Stones at a party they threw on a
riverboat after their 1982 performance in the Superdome.
   At Jazz Fest, though, he just plays to the crowd. He sizes them
up and does what he thinks they'll like _ some fast songs, some
slow, some blues. He also does his old hits: ``I Don't Know Why I
Love You But I Do,'' ``You Always Hurt The One You Love'' and, of
course, ``Ain't Got No Home.''
   ``I'm getting old now. I can't do it as well as I used to. My
voice has changed. It was easy when I was young to do the frog
singing or to sing like a girl. Now I have to work for it. It still
gets people, though. It's something to see when they all start
wooing along with me.''

   A real trouper is one who, despite a
near-fatal gassing, can rebound almost immediately to audition for
a good part.
   Crystal Bernard fits that description. It's why she's now a
co-star of NBC's ``Wings,'' playing Helen Chappel, an aspiring
cellist who runs the lunch counter at a small airport on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass.
   Bernard, whose character is the long-time friend of Timothy Daly
and Steven Weber, cast as owners of a one-plane commuter airline,
considers herself lucky in more than one way.
   She was working on the TV movie ``Without Her Consent'' on a day
when filming was delayed because of lighting problems.
   ``I went to my trailer to lie down and I passed out because of
carbon-monoxide poisoning,'' she said. ``They found me in the
trailer's toilet about three hours later. I was paralyzed. I
couldn't move. They rushed me to one hospital, then to another,
where I was put into an oxygen chamber.
   ``I was very close to dying. When I was released from the
hospital, I had to have someone watch me at night to see that I
didn't have a seizure. When I woke up the next morning, I found a
script on my door. It was `Wings,' and I went down immediately to
read for it. I know that's ludicrous, but I loved it so much.''
   ``Wings'' was created by three former producers and writers for
``Cheers'' _ David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee _ and follows
``Cheers'' on Thursdays.
   The show, which runs for seven episodes, has gotten mixed
reviews from critics, but Bernard, who spent five years on the
syndicated comedy ``It's a Living,'' is convinced it's going to
make it despite tough competition from ABC's ``Twin Peaks.''
   Bernard spent a year on ``Happy Days,'' had a recurring role on
``My Two Dads'' and has appeared several times on ``Paradise'' as a
school teacher. She co-starred with Michael J. Fox in the TV movie
``High School U.S.A.,'' and earlier this year was seen in the movie
pilot ``Chameleons.''
   ``Wings'' had been delayed for several months because the
producers had not been able to cast the part of Helen, which
originally was conceived as a fiery Greek woman.
   After Bernard was cast, she had to complete work on ``Without
Her Consent'' and wait out a commitment to an ABC pilot called
``Hot Prospects.'' Production was postponed until January, when she
became available.
   Her character on the show is, like herself, from Texas. But
unlike Bernard, she's a woman who has struggled to shed 60 pounds.
She's also fiery and outspoken.
   ``Helen has a weight problem, and I kind of figure that's why
she's fiery,'' Bernard said. ``People would comment on her weight,
and she'd fire back. Nobody has her number ...''
   Bernard says she has been cast in every comedy role she's
auditioned for, but not every venture has been a success.
   Once, on a visit to Los Angeles for a religious concert with her
father, she tried to get the president of NBC on the telephone to
tell him she wanted her own variety show.
   ``I had my costumes and everything,'' she said. ``He didn't take
my call.''
   Later, when Bernard moved to Los Angeles the only name she knew
was modeling agent Nina Blanchard's.
   ``I'd seen her on `The Merv Griffin Show,''' Bernard said. ``She
said I was too short (5-foot-2). I went back and barged into her
office. She was puffing on a cigarette and said, `Honey, you're a
midget, but I think you're going to be a star.'
   ``She signed me to a commercials contract, and I got a job the
next day. I'd spent a day and a half as a waitress and I was
terrible. I went from making $3.50 an hour as a waitress one day to
$1,400 a day for four days' work on a commercial. I thought I'd
struck oil.''
   Bernard grew up singing and performing all over the country with
her father, Jerry Wayne Bernard, a Southern Baptist evangelical
minister.
   Her older sister, Robin Bernard, is on ABC's ``General
Hospital,'' and another sister, Scarlett, was in the movie ``Jack
in the Box.'' Her youngest sister, Angelique, is a student at
Baylor University, which Bernard attended before striking out for
Hollywood.
   ``I've wanted to be an actress since I was 3,'' she said. ``I
started imitating Cher and Barbra Streisand and Jeannie C. Riley.
By the time I was in the fifth grade, I had a Cher act I did all
over Houston for the Rotary, Elks, and other clubs.''

   When they found 11-year-old Billy Ruff
hanged from the big maple tree he loved to climb, innocence died in
the hearts of his brothers and sisters.
   They saw his killer everywhere, in anyone. The surviving Ruff
children _ five living when Billy died 33 years ago, three born
later _ lived with a fear so deep it darkened every waking moment,
terror inspired by a real-life bogeyman who preyed on happy,
fresh-faced kids who loved raisin cookies and baseball.
   Kids like Billy. Kids like them.
   ``All of us, at one time or another, didn't think we'd reach the
age of 11,'' said Tim Ruff, who was 3 when Billy died.
   Then one day three years ago, Christopher Ruff glanced up at the
bulletin board in the police station where he worked and into the
face of the man who killed the brother he never knew.
   ``Mom and I knew, as soon as I called her,'' said Chris, at 24
the youngest Ruff, born eight years after his brother's death and
two months after his father's. ``We both started to shake and say,
`This is it.'''
   Last Monday, he saw the man again _ in Albany County Court,
where he was sentenced to life in prison for Billy's murder.
   It was not murder, however, that put Billy's killer on a wanted
poster; it was a sex abuse charge involving a girl about Billy's
age. The awful secret his family had hidden was that Billy Ruff had
been sodomized before he died.
   ``This sort of thing wasn't spoken about,'' Mildred Ruff said,
sitting in her living room surrounded by six of her children.
``People wouldn't talk about child molesting. It was a hush-hush
thing.''
   Smith Avenue, in the northwestern suburb of Albany where the
family lived, was a street full of children in a rural landscape of
fields and trees the day Billy Ruff disappeared.
   He was last seen at 4:30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 31, 1957, his
pocket full of raisin cookies, in his hand a length of frayed
clothesline he planned to use to steer a homemade go-cart.
   He didn't show up for dinner. Mrs. Ruff remembers wrapping his
plate of lamb chops, boiled potatoes and corn on the cob in wax
paper and putting it in the fridge. At 9 p.m., she called her
husband at work, and he began a search that lasted until dawn.
   In her fitful sleep that night, Mrs. Ruff had a dream or a
vision, she wasn't sure which: ``I saw Billy, on his knees, hanging
by a rope.''
   That's the way he was found the next day by a friend's daughter
_ hanged with his own clothesline in a densely wooded lot where all
the kids played, and played for years after.
   Police interviewed hundreds of people. ``They didn't care how
many hours they put in,'' said Raymond Rasmussen, one of the first
state police detectives put on the case. ``We got to feel very
close and very compassionate for the family and what they'd been
through.''
   What they could not know was that the killer was there, among
them; then, in the noise and confusion of grief and of police work,
he was gone.
   ``The night of the wake, a priest friend of ours said it may
take 20 years, but nobody can keep this thing to themselves,'' Mrs.
Ruff said. ``And I said, if it takes 20 days, I'll lose my mind.''
   Instead, she found strength and faith, enough to last her family
through Billy's death, the death of her husband eight years later,
and her own current fight with cancer. For years, she carried in
her apron pocket a rosary her husband had given her. The black
beads wore to brown from constant fingering.
   Twenty days became 20 months. The investigation died down. The
police stopped coming by with mug shots of child molesters.
   Seven years passed. The police came around one last time to tell
the family a forensics expert had decided Billy's death was
accidental. His family scoffed; they knew the truth would surface,
a belief that never wavered as 10 years became 20, then 30.
   ``We know what it's like to have a lot of unanswered
questions,'' said John, born four years after Billy's murder. ``But
in the back of our minds, there was always the hope.''
   There was also fear _ of the dark, of being alone, of getting
too close to people.
   ``Everybody grew up with a paranoia,'' Chris said. ``We couldn't
have a normal childhood because we were so damn scared. There's not
one time we can walk into an empty house and feel safe. Not one of
us.''
   Regina, the oldest, 13 when Billy died, and Tommy, who was 5,
told their mother they knew there was a bogeyman because he got
their brother. All the Ruffs _ Regina, Tom, Tim, Joe, Lisa, Jay,
John and Chris _ worried he was out to get another of them.
   ``We'd stand at the window, stand there and watch when people
weren't home on time,'' said Lisa, who was 8 months old when Billy
was murdered. ``I remember standing at my bed in the back bedroom,
looking out the window and knowing I was doing the same thing as
Mom was. We were always scared.''
   The fear became something they lived and breathed. In time, they
would pass it on to their spouses, to their children.
   ``I was terrorized by nightmares most of my life,'' Regina wrote
in a recent letter to her mother. ``I had to force myself to go
anywhere. I was afraid of the dark and of the daylight.
   ``All this destruction, all this fear _ and I am only one of
eight. Multiply the damage to me by every other life this touched.''
   While Billy's brothers and sisters struggled with demons, his
killer was finishing a stint in the Air Force and spending short
periods as an Albany police officer and an ironworker. He married
three times and fathered two children by a fourth woman. In the
1970s he wandered the streets, a homeless alcoholic.
   ``I think he was a man that had this on his mind all that
time,'' Rasmussen said. ``Maybe that caused him to become what he
was.''

   Michael Milken, the billionaire financier who
reshaped Wall Street in the 1980s but fell in its biggest scandal,
pleaded guilty to breaking federal securities and tax laws and
agreed to pay a record $600 million in penalties.
   Milken, 43, broke down and sobbed Tuesday before a packed
Manhattan courtroom as he finished a lengthy statement outlining
his crimes, which included illegal tradin with stock speculator
Ivan Boesky and others from 1984-86.
   Milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison at his scheduled Oct.
1 sentencing, although legal experts expect a term of around five
years.

   Three years, five months and 10 days after Ivan
F. Boesky promised to hand over other Wall Street cheaters,
investigators corraled the biggest name he dangled before them:
Michael R. Milken.
   The emotional guilty plea in federal court Tuesday by the former
head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s famed junk bond department
was the Holy Grail in the government's crusade to weed out
financial crime.
   Milken, 43, admitted to six counts of violating federal
securities and tax laws and agreed to pay $600 million in
penalties. He faces up to 28 years in prison at a scheduled Oct. 1
sentencing.
   The admissions, despite Milken's previous avowals of innocence,
``demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network of
manipulation, fraud and deceit,'' said SEC Chairman Richard Breeden.
   After Boesky pleaded guilty on Nov. 14, 1986, the ex-speculator
provided information that led to Milken as well as to several Wall
Street investment bankers, takeover artists, arbitragers, bond
dealers and trading assistants.
   But with the exception of one case widely considered ironclad _
the fraud conviction and four-year prison term for Florida investor
Paul Bilzerian _ the government has been criticized for bringing
weak prosecutions on technical violations.
   Now the government has succeeded in getting its main target, a
man who built a $200 billion market for high-risk paper and helped
used to money to feed a takeover boom. His plea including a record
fine against an individual and a potentially long prison term.
   ``They put an end to a criticism that probably was bothering
them a good deal,'' Columbia University securities law professor
John C. Coffee Jr. said. ``The idea that this was a witch hunt
tends to fade pretty quickly when the witch pleads guilty.''
   Milken supporters maintained he was persecuted because of the
enormous power he wielded over the nation's financial markets from
his X-shaped trading desk at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office.
   Nevertheless, Milken pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, helping
others violate federal securities regulations and assisting in the
filing of a false tax return.
   He broke down as he read an 11-page statement detailing the
charges and apologizing for his actions. His voice cracked as he
admitted he was, ``Guilty, your honor.''
   The charges included illegal stock parking arrangements with
Boesky involving the 1984 takeover target Fishbach Corp., stock
manipulation in MCA Corp. in 1985, illegal trading with client
David Solomon in 1985 and 1986, and illegally helping Solomon skirt
tax laws.
   A constant in the deals was that Milken promised illegal quid
pro quos apparently to help clients or Drexel turn a profit.
   Still, the charges were lighter than the most serious
allegations in the 98-count indictment handed up in March 1989.
   ``The charges are a far cry from the lurid, irresponsible and
prejudicial accusations against Michael that have been made by
anonymous sources to the press for the past 3{ years,'' Milken
attorney Arthur Liman said.
   ``The charges do not involve (racketeering) or insider trading,
nor do they reflect the fundamentals of the junk bond market,'' he
said. ``They involve instances in which Michael went too far in
helping clients ... which is not to minimize the plea.''
   Milken emphasized that junk bonds weren't involved in the
charges, telling the court his plea was an admission of personal
responsibility ``and not a reflection of the underlying soundness
and integrity of the capital markets in which we specialized.''
   The plea deal bars Milken from the securities industry forever
and requires him to assist the continuing investigations related to
the insider trading scandal. The government dropped all charges
against Milken's brother, Lowell.
   Milken widely is regarded as the most important American
financier since J.P. Morgan Jr. in the early 1900s. He came to
symbolize the bounty and excesses of a booming Wall Street and
amassed a personal fortune that is believed to exceed $1 billion.
   He pioneered the use of high-yield debt securities known as junk
bonds, giving small companies access to billions of dollars in
capital and making possible the wave of hostile corporate takeovers
that characterized the dog-eat-dog 1980s.
   His downfall began after he was linked to an insider trading
network by Boesky, who received a three-year prison term and was
fined $100 million in November 1986 to settle his own case.
   Boesky also led prosecutors to stockbroker Boyd Jefferies, GAF
Corp. executive James Sherwin, speculator Sandy Lewis and
arbitrager Robert Freeman, but they received prison terms of only
three to six months or just probation.
   Milken vigorously maintained his innocence after he was
indicted, saying he planned to fight the charges at trial. He
reversed course last week and agreed to the plea bargain, avoiding
a long courtroom confrontation and the prospect of a much stiffer
prison term.
   Under the settlement, which also resolves civil charges, Milken
will pay $200 million in fines and place $400 million in a
Securities and Exchange Commission account to compensate defrauded
investors. He still can be sued by private investors, however.
   The Milken plea comes just two months after Drexel began
liquidating when its parent company filed for bankruptcy
protection. Drexel itself pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed
to pay $650 million to settle related charges.

   Here is a chronology of major developments in the prosecution of
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief Michael Milken:
   Nov. 14, 1986 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky pays $100 million
to settle charges of insider trading on information supplied by
investment banker Dennis Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to
cooperate with investigators and to plead guilty to a single
criminal charge. Boesky later is sentenced to three years in prison.
   Late 1986 _ Published reports link Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
high-yield bond financier Michael Milken to an illegal insider
trading network led by Boesky.
   Sept. 7, 1988 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses
Drexel, Milken and three others of violating a wide range of
securities laws, most of them in connection with Boesky.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud case in history. Drexel also must settle
related SEC charges and cooperate with the government investigation.
   March 29, 1989 _ A federal grand jury indicts Milken, his
brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg on 98
counts of racketeering and fraud largely based on information
supplied by Boesky. Potential penalties and fines under the counts
amount to about $12 billion plus possible prison terms.
   April 7 _ The Milkens plead innocent. Newberg enters an innocent
plea later.
   April 13 _ Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud case that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.
   June 15 _ Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his
own consulting firm. Lowell Milken quits to return to practicing
law.
   Sept. 11 _ Drexel pleads guilty to six felonies and begins
paying more than $650 million in fines, penalties and interest.
   Feb. 13, 1990 _ Drexel's parent company files for federal
bankruptcy court protection after failing to meet short-term debt
payments. The securities firm, once the nation's fifth-largest,
starts laying off its 5,400 employees.
   March 19 _ Prosecutors promise to bring a new indictment with
broader charges against Milken by the week of April 16.
   April 4 _ Boesky is released from federal custody after
completing two years of a three-year term.
   April 19 _ Four months of negotiations intensify between the
government and Milken for a possible plea bargain to settle the
case as a deadline looms for the new indictment.
   April 20 _ Sources say Milken agrees to plead guilty to six
felony counts and pay fines and restitution totaling $600 million
under a plea agreement with prosecutors.
   April 24 _ Milken pleads guilty to six criminal charges and
agrees to pay fines and restitution totaling $600 million to settle
his case. The charges of securities and tax law violations are much
less serious than the insider trading and racketeering counts
brought against him in the government's indictment.

   Milken, from his statement in court, on his admission of guilt:
   ``I am here today because in connection with some transactions,
I transgressed certain of the laws and regulations that govern our
industry. I was wrong in doing so and knew that at the time and I
am pleading guilty to these offenses.''
   On his relationship with disgraced stock speculator Ivan Boesky,
who led federal investigators to Milken:
   ``We were not social friends, and had little in common. The
relationship started as an arms-length and correct one.
Unfortunately, however, certain of our transactions involved
reciprocal accommodations, some of which violated the law.''
   On his personal ordeal:
   ``I realize that by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to
me. I am truly sorry.''

place, because I have done nothing wrong. ... I am proud of my
brother and nothing that has happened here today has changed that.''

potential here that the perpetrator of these crimes will face up to
28 years in prison. We think that's a good settlement.''

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks
tumbled 17.7 percent in mid-April, indicating that incentives
aren't drawing the crowds like they did a year ago.
   ``It's just a lot tougher fight,'' said Alan Helfman, general
manager of River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in Houston.
   Part of the fight Helfman and other dealers are facing is coming
from vehicles made in the United States by Japanese companies, the
so-called ``transplants.''
   Sales of cars and trucks made by General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. were down 20.5 percent during
mid-April while sales of transplant vehicles rose 23.6 percent.
   The 10 major U.S. car and truck makers reported selling an
average of 34,071 vehicles a day during the April 11-20 period this
year, compared with a daily average of 41,380 last year.
   Car sales were down 19.1 percent and truck sales were off 15.1
percent.
   For the year to date, domestic car and truck sales were down 3.5
percent, with car sales falling 4.3 percent and truck sales
dropping 2 percent.
   Auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Services, Inc.,
in New York said it was tough to gauge the demand for new cars and
trucks.
   ``I don't see much of a pattern,'' she said. ``It's very jumpy.''
   Automakers have relied on incentives to increase otherwise slow
showroom traffic. But Helfman said sales have tapered off this
month compared with March despite the continued presence of
incentives.
   ``I'm not losing any sales,'' he said, ``I'm not getting them
either.''
   Chrysler took the hardest beating of the Big Three, as its
combined car and truck sales fell 36.2 percent. Once again, as it
has in other recent 10-day reporting periods, Chrysler's trucks
outsold its cars, this time 20,393 to 18,692.
   ``I think they (Chrysler executives) are trying to figure out
where the Imperial, the New Yorker and the Landau are,'' Helfman
said of the company's luxury cars. ``We're selling some of each,
but not to any great magnitude.''
   GM and Ford posted significant but less drastic declines in
their mid-April sales. Sales of GM cars and trucks were down 15.9
percent during the period and Ford sales were off 19 percent.
   The mid-April period of 1989 was among the strongest of last
year. In late March and early April last year, the Big Three
sweetened their incentive packages by offering bigger cash rebates
and slashing interest rates.
   As it did last year, Chrysler this month offered interest-free
financing on two-year loans for some of its Jeeps and cars, and
reduced financing rates on longer-term loans. It was too early on
Tuesday to tell if the new incentive program was having an effect
on the company's sales.
   Chrysler's car sales during mid-April fell 38.4 percent compared
with a year ago and truck sales were down 33.9 percent.
   Sales of GM cars were down 18.9 percent and its truck sales fell
9.6 percent. Ford's car sales were down 22.7 percent and truck
sales dropped 13.1 percent in mid-April.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major
automakers with plants in North America for the second 10-day
period in April 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year, and 94 selling days so far this year,
compared with 93 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table. Subaru and Isuzu began producing cars and
light trucks in September at a joint venture plant in Lafayette,
Ind.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Study Accuses Lender of Gouging Billions from Consumers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study says the nation's mortgage
lenders are requiring homeowners to keep billions of dollars of
excess funds in escrow accounts to fatten the lenders' profits.
   ``Many of the nation's mortgage lenders systematically have
broken the law,'' says the report, compiled by attorneys general
from seven states and released Tuesday.
   They said the violations have been taking place for more than a
decade and called on federal officials to tighten enforcement of
laws limiting the amount lenders can set aside in escrow accounts.
   ``Our study concludes we need a national solution to this
problem,'' said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, one of those
sponsoring the report. ``We must have change throughout the
industry so we don't penalize individual companies or individual
states who insist on legal escrow cushions.''
   The study estimates that the average amount of excess escrow
could be as much as $150 for every mortgage, which would amount to
several billion dollars nationwide. The report says it is routine
for lenders to hold more than twice as much as the law allows in
escrow accounts.
   A spokesman for one bank cited in the study denied any
wrongdoing.
   Escrow accounts are kept by lending institutions to make
payments for property taxes, insurance and other items which
borrowers must pay.
   Extra money in escrow accounts hurts consumers and is a bonanza
for lenders because they get to use the money for free or pay only
a very low rate of interest on the funds.
   About two-thirds of the nation's home mortgages involve escrow
accounts. In many cases lenders ignore the contracts they sign with
consumers when they make loans, the report said.
   ``Thus, the total dollar amount over-escrowed is likely to be
even larger than the states' analysis,'' the report says.
   Federal law limits lenders to keeping a two-month ``cushion'' in
escrow, or enough money to make payments for two months. The
cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if
the consumer is late making a monthly payment.
   ``Right now, cushions sometimes amount to three to five months
of the annual tax and insurance bills and that's not fair to
consumers,'' Miller said. ``The excessive cushion can't be
justified as protecting the lenders' investment. It simply gives
them more of the consumers' money to earn bigger profits.''
   The report called on Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Jack Kemp to tighten enforcement of the law.
   ``HUD has the power to end these industry-wide violations once
and for all,'' the officials said in a letter to Kemp.
   The study was conducted by attorneys general in Iowa,
California, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Texas.
The attorneys general have complained to Kemp about the issue since
1988.
   ``This important issue, involving billions of consumer dollars,
remains in administrative limbo,'' the report concluded.
   The two-year study focused on big lenders who operate
nationwide. A survey of four of the largest _ Citibank, GMAC
Mortgage Corp., Fleet Mortgage Corp. and Lomas Financial Group. _
``indicated that lenders may be holding excessive and illegal
cushions in more than 70 percent of escrow accounts.''
   Susan Weeks, vice president of public affairs for Citicorp,
parent of Citibank, said the New York-based company was ``a little
surprised by the announcement.''
   She said Citicorp has been working with New York Attorney
General Robert Abrams for more than a year on the matter. ``We've
explained to him we're in compliance,'' she said.
   She said the law allows the bank to hold funds in escrow to pay
for expenses on the account, and permits a two-month cushion on top
of that.
   ``If there is anything in excess of that, we automatically
return it to the consumer. And then we recalculate what that escrow
payment should be each month,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fisher-Price Lost Focus: Analysts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fisher-Price's ill-fated attempt to broaden its
line of toys is a textbook case of how a company can get into
trouble by ignoring its basic business in a drive to expand,
analysts say.
   Fisher-Price's troubles became too much for Quaker Oats Co. The
food company said Tuesday it would spin off its toy division to
shareholders.
   Quaker also reported a 60 percent drop in its fiscal third
quarter net income. The results included a $25 million operating
loss at Fisher-Price.
   Consumers long have associated the Fisher-Price name with
sturdy, simple, imaginative toys for pre-schoolers.
   But the company's attempts to transfer that name recognition to
toys aimed at older children did not work out well, said John G.
Taylor, who follows the toy industry for L.H. Alton &amp; Co., a San
Francisco brokerage.
   ``They took their eye off their basic business,'' Taylor said.
That enabled Hasbro's Playskool division, Rubbermaid's Little Tikes
division and Mattel's Disney-character toys to make inroads into
Fisher-Price's traditional market.
   Fisher-Price's electronic car and electronic guitar, two
products introduced in 1989, reportedly hit production snags that
delayed shipments to stores in the critical months before
Christmas, hurting their sales.
   And in the hit-driven toy industry, a pricey product that fails
to live up to expectations can have severe repercussions.
   ``If you lose your focus on your staple, predictable product
line, you can get into real trouble if your hit toys turn out to be
not such big hits after all,'' said analyst Carol I. Palmer at Duff
&amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Fisher-Price remains the world's largest maker of infant and
pre-school toys such as the Pull-A-Tune xylophone and the Little
People farm.
   But fierce competition and its costly attempts to expand have
cost it millions of dollars and precious market share points.
   Still, Taylor said the company has a potent name.
   ``People will say `I'm going to buy a Fisher-Price toy,''' he
said. ``That's a unique kind of thing to have.
   ``If they can focus on reinforcing that reputation for quality
and play value that they've had in the past, they ought to be able
to get back on track.''
   Quaker Chairman William D. Smithburg said Fisher-Price should
fare better as an independent, publicly owned company.
   ``In the long term, a Fisher-Price which is not part of a larger
company should be a more focused organization, which should enhance
its competitiveness and facilitate the attraction, retention and
motivation of its management and employees,'' Smithburg said in a
statement.
   Quaker's stock rose 62{ cents to $49.25 a share Tuesday in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Chicago-based Quaker had been rumored for several months to be
considering selling Fisher-Price, which posted an 11 percent
decline in operating income in fiscal 1989 and last month closed a
manufacturing plant in its headquarters city of East Aurora, N.Y.
   Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said the company had received
``some unsolicited expressions of interest'' in Fisher-Price but
ultimately decided a spinoff would provide the greatest value to
shareholders.
   Pending approval by the Internal Revenue Service, Quaker said it
expects to complete a tax-free distribution of Fisher-Price stock
to Quaker shareholders by the first quarter of 1991.
   The new company's board will elect its own chief executive,
Quaker said. Paul E. Price, Fisher-Price's interim president and
chief operating officer, will return to his responsibilities as
Quaker's chief financial officer.
   Founded 60 years ago, Fisher-Price was acquired by Quaker in
1969 and saw its sales grow from $32 million to $800 million during
the past 20 years. It employs about 7,400 people worldwide.
   Price said in February that Fisher-Price's market share in young
children's toys had dropped in 1989 to the high 8 percent range
from 10 percent.
   Bottrell said Fisher-Price had an operating loss of about $25
million, including $10.7 million in plant-closing costs, for the
three months ending March 31, compared with income of $9.2 million
in the third quarter of 1989.
   Quaker's overall net income fell to $25.6 million, or 32 cents a
share, from $64.1 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion.

   President Bush is dismissing a prediction that
his proposed cutbacks in farm program payments would cause a
financial crisis in agriculture.
   The president reacted Tuesday to concerns raised by Sen. Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., who wants the Senate Agriculture Committee to
approve price supports of $12 billion a year for five years under
the 1990 farm bill.
   Kerrey said farm economy has improved considerably since the
early 1980s.
   However, he told a meeting of the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists, ``If you don't provide this level of
funding, in two years you are going to see this recovery vanish.''
   ``There are many things I respect about Senator Kerrey,'' said
Bush told the same group later in the day. ``Sometimes we have a
philosophical difference of opinion. I have a different view on
this.''
   Bush is seeking $10.2 billion in price supports for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1. His proposals envision further cuts in
government support over the years and more prosperity for farmers
in the open market.
   But Kerrey said failed farming operations brought on by
insufficient government support would cost more taxpayer money in
the long run than the annual $12 billion he is advocating.
   The crops protected by the government subsidies are the big
money crops _ wheat, corn, cotton, soybeans and rice.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who appeared with Bush,
said farm income need not be dependent on the government.
   ``There's a market out there,'' said Yeutter. ``All of us are
concerned about farm income.''
   Yeutter and Kerrey, both Nebraskans, have been wrangling for
months over how much government support should be provided to
farmers.
   The agriculture secretary said he could not predict support
payments for the remaining four years of the farm bill because
international trade talks _ known as the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT _ are not yet
complete.
   The administration has been working through GATT to open the
international marketplace by removing subsidies, which Yeutter and
other officials say distort prices.
   Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, who also spoke to the agricultural
journalists, said he would like to see government out of the farm
business altogether.
   He said he is putting together a coalition in Congress to oppose
the support programs being devised by the agriculture committees
when the bill gets to the floor.

<HEAD>Deficit Widens Sharply, Pound Plummets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit soared in
March to $3.6 billion, the second-worst gap on record, the
government reported Wednesday.
   The widening from $2.3 billion in February sent the pound
plummeting and prompted the Bank of England to intervene to support
the British currency.
   The government blamed the shortfall largely on higher imports of
oil and of erratic items such as civil aircraft and precious
metals. Imports hit a record during the latest month.
   The pound fell to $1.6265 by about noon local time from $1.6345
just before the trade report was released.
   The Bank of England intervened to support the pound by selling
dollars, sources familiar with the intervention said. The Bank of
England declined to comment on the reported intervention, as is its
practice.
   ``It was pretty disastrous numbers,'' said Jeff Earnshaw, deputy
head of foreign exchange trading at Natwest Moneycenter. He said
the bad trade news could easily spark a prolonged slide in sterling.
   A Treasury spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance with
British practice, said: ``The deterioration is almost entirely the
result of higher imports, not lower exports.''
   But dealers said the news could seriously shake the financial
markets' recent confidence that the country's trade position was
improving.
   The current account deficit also soared to $3.6 billion from
$2.3 billion, the Central Statistical Office said.
   The current account deficit equals the merchandise trade deficit
plus so-called invisible trade, such as services, overseas
investment earnings and official transfer payments.
   The markets had expected deficits of $2.2 billion.
   The statistical office said the deficits were the second worse
on record after a $3.9 billion merchandise trade gap and a $3.8
billion current account shortfall in August 1989.
   Exports totaled $13.6 billion in March, down from $13.7 billion
in February. Imports totaled a record $17.2 billion in March, up
from $16 billion.
   Since the beginning of the year, the merchandise trade deficit
has grown to $9.1 billion, compared with a shortfall of $9.8
billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Michael Milken's switch from defiant defendant
to humble felon has aroused responses ranging from sympathy to
scorn to skepticism over whether justice was served in the
billionaire financier's plea bargain.
   Following Milken's tearful admission of guilt Tuesday, defense
lawyers and friends said they understood the pressure he faced in
capitulating to a government deadline to cooperate or face a more
devastating prosecution on charges of racketeering.
   ``I can't in my memory think of an individual who has been so
hammered, through leaks, through allegations, through innuendo,
without having the opportunity to stand up,'' said attorney Ira L.
Sorkin, a former Securities and Exchange Commission administrator
now in private practice.
   Milken's former employer Drexel Burnham Lambert, also tainted by
Wall Street scandal and now in a bankruptcy-court supervised
liquidation, expressed sympathy for the man who once made Drexel a
powerful investment firm.
   ``Michael Milken was highly esteemed for his contributions in
creating a new capital market and today's events are a tragedy for
him, his family and for those who were associated with him,''
Drexel said in a statement.
   But others said Milken's guilty plea amounts to a wrist-slap for
enormous criminality and means the public may never know the true
extent of possible wrongdoing, particularly in ``junk bonds,'' the
high-yield, high-risk securities on which Milken and Drexel built
their fortunes.
   Milken admitted guilt to six counts of breaking securities and
tax laws, for which he faces a maximum 28 year prison term and must
pay $600 million in fines and restitution. That still will leave
him enormously wealthy.
   ``The government's agreement with Mr. Milken raises more
questions than it answers,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who monitors
the securities industry and has frequently criticized its alleged
transgressors.
   ``The fines assessed amount to less than a year's compensation
for Mr. Milken, according to the most conserviative estimates,''
Dingell said. `Ironically, the man known as the junk-bond king was
not charged with any violations with respect to his junk bond
transactions.''
   The plea capped an ordeal that had dogged Milken and Drexel
since stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky began feeding incriminating
information about them to authorities in 1986.
   Despite Milken's cathartic admission that he was a felon, some
said his apology masked the reasons he violated the law in the
first place and insisted for more than three years that he was
innocent.
   ``Milken was clearly a genius who achieved a lot on the
merits,'' said Thomas Dunfee, ethics professor at the prestigious
Wharton School, where Milken earned an MBA degree. ``Why he
couldn't stop is a mystery to me. Why didn't playing by the rules
provide enough satisfaction? If we can get an answer to that it
would help us to better understand attitudes about the law.''
   Others argued that Milken still believes he was innocent but was
bludgeoned into confessing by prosecutors who abused the
racketeering law, which shaped the original 98-count indictment
against him.
   ``I've always thought that to put racketeering counts on
businessmen for money crimes was a misuse of the law,'' said James
Linn, a prominent attorney who has represented other defendants in
the Wall Street scandal. ``I think it's always wrong to use that as
a threat to hang over a defendant's head to make him take some
lesser counts.''
   Some said the relatively few charges in the plea agreement did
not mean the government had let Milken off easily. Many believe
Milken will have to do some prison time.
   ``It's silly to play the game of who got the better deal,'' said
Sorkin. ``The fact of the matter is Mr. Milken is a convicted
felon. Federal prison, minimum or maximum, is not a very pleasant
place.''
   Others said the government benefited enormously from Milken's
plea because it will eliminate a costly trial that could take years.
   ``Pleading guilty to six counts is really quite serious,'' said
Arthur Miller, a Harvard Law professor. ``The truth is he is guilty
and he will have to carry that stigma for the rest of his life.''
   On Wall Street, where the Boesky-Drexel-Milken scandal has
become folklore, news of Milken's guilty plea provoked little
sympathy. Many securities industry workers believe the scandal
played a role in eroding the public appetite for stocks in recent
years.
   John Eric Smith, a brokerage official at the New York Stock
Exchange, said the Milken case was like a cleansing process that
should restore investor confidence. ``If you're caught doing
something wrong, you've got to pay for it,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, the British retailer
famous for its flower print dresses and English country look, said
Wednesday it suffered a $16 million net loss in its latest fiscal
year.
   The company cited disappointing clothing sales in the United
States and declining fabric and wallpaper sales in Britain.
   The loss for the year ended Jan. 27 compared with net profit of
$13.7 million in the previous year.
   Sales rose 18 percent to $483.5 million from $411 million.
   Laura Ashley said it was embarking on a major cost-cutting and
streamlining program that ``might include the disposal of certain
businesses or assets, the reduction of stock and the restriction of
new shop openings.''
   It currently operates 481 stores.
   Richard Ratner, a retail analyst with the London investment firm
Kitcat and Aitken, said: ``They should've done that ages ago. It'll
be too little too late.''
   Laura Ashley is suffering from weak management and manufacturing
difficulties, analysts said. Its debt is large enough to offset
strong sales, they said.

<HEAD>Koito Raises Dividend, Following Demand From Pickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koito Manufacturing Co., which has been resisting
advances by T. Boone Pickens Jr., announced Wednesday it has raised
its dividend following a demand from the Texas oilman.
   The auto parts maker said it would add an extra 2 yen, the
equivalent of 1 cent, to its regular dividend of 8 yen a share for
the fiscal year that ended March 31. Koito initially had rejected
Pickens' demand for a larger dividend.
   Pickens became the largest stockholder in the company last year
after buying a large holding from Kitaro Watanabe, the owner of
Azabu Motors and other Japanese companies.
   Japan's Finance Ministry has ruled Watanabe violated securities
regulations by buying and reselling his shares to Pickens in too
short a period, and ordered him to pay Koito the 1.1 billion yen,
or $6.9 million, he reportedly made in the transaction.
   In his demand last September for increasing dividend payments by
3 yen a share, Pickens said the money received by the company from
Watanabe should be distributed to its shareholders.
   Koito management has viewed Pickens' stock purchases as
threatening, and has refused his demands for a seat on its board
and a chance to review its books.
   The company has expressed concern that Pickens would return a
portion of his extra dividend to Watanabe, who it said ``twice
sought to greenmail Koito with the shares he later transferred to
Mr. Pickens.''
   Greenmail is the practice of buying up stock in a company and
forcing the company or a friendly affiliate to buy back the shares
at a higher price.
   Pickens later pledged in a letter to Koito that none of the
increased dividends would be channeled back to Watanabe.
   A Koito official said the decision to increase the dividend
``had some connection'' with Pickens' demand.
   ``But the decision wasn't based only on that,'' he said. ``The
committee, after studying the issue, decided that it was
appropriate to distribute the money among all the stockholders.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Koito
remained concerned that a portion of Pickens' share might go to
Watanabe, ``but we want to believe in his promise.''
   Pickens now holds 26.4 percent of the company's stock, or nearly
42.4 million shares, up from 32.4 million shares a year ago, the
official said.
   Pickens has testified in the U.S. Congress that his failure to
win management rights in Koito shows that Japan is closed to U.S.
investors. But Koito officials say they are reluctant to give him
management power because of his reputation as a corporate raider.
   Pickens earlier this month also asked Japan's Fair Trade
Commission to investigate what he said were violations of the
Anti-Monopoly Law resulting from the close relations between
Japanese automakers and parts suppliers. Commission officials said
they would study his claims and decide what action to take.
   Toyota Motor Corp. is the second-largest stockholder in Koito,
with about 19 percent of the company's shares.

<HEAD>Non-Striking Eastern Pilots Forming New Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Eastern Airlines pilots is forming a
new union to unseat the Air Line Pilots Association as its
bargaining agent and prevent ALPA from reclaiming jobs held by
replacement pilots since the Eastern strike.
   ``Our statement t o ALPA is: `You don't represent us anymore,'''
said Steve Glasgow, a veteran Atlanta-based pilot who is among the
organizers of the union, Eastern Pilots Association.
   The group must get approval from 50 percent of eligible pilots.
The National Mediation Board then must certify the results and
oversee formal voting.
   A majority vote would end ALPA's presence at the troubled
airline and give the new union negotiating power.
   Many of the new union's organizers never joined the March 1989
pilots' walkout and have renounced their ALPA memberships. They are
joined by replacement pilots worried that their jobs could be
sacrificed in any new agreement between ALPA and court-appointed
Eastern trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr., who has talked of achieving
``labor peace.''
   Tom Cooper, a 28-year Eastern veteran and temporary chairman of
the new union, said about 100 pilots attended recent organizational
meetings in Miami. He said the group plans to spend about $200,000
on the organizing effort and will hire a law firm to help.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined comment.
   E.J. Breen, a spokesman for ALPA's Eastern members, called the
movement ``counterproductive'' and hinted at legal challenges.
   ``The enemy has been Frank Lorenzo,'' he said, referring to the
Texas Air Corp. chairman, whose control of Eastern was given to
Shugrue by a bankruptcy judge.
   ``Now it looks like some self-serving individuals on the inside
want to start a new war,'' Breen said.
   Eastern has about 1,800 working pilots. About half crossed
picket lines or refused to honor the strike, and half are
replacement hires.

<TEXT>
   Florida has ordered aerial pesticide spraying to
protect the state's $1.4 billion citrus industry from an
infestation of Medflies.
   Spraying of malathion has worked in past infestations of the
Mediterranean fruit fly and there's no reason to change methods now
and ``run into the grave risk of getting into the predicament
California is in,'' state Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner
said Tuesday.
   In Southern California, aerial spraying of malathion in suburban
neighborhoods has caused an uproar, while the pest has spread into
orange and grapefruit groves in some of the region's richest
farmland.
   And while expanded spraying over a 52-square-mile area of Los
Angeles and San Bernardino counties was ordered Tuesday, scientists
admitted that malathion spraying there may be a failing strategy.
   ``It's clear that we're not doing the job with the current
approach,'' said Jim Carey, an entomology professor at the
University of California, Davis and member of the state Medfly
Science Advisory Board. The Medfly infestation is ``bordering on
being out of control, if not out of control.''
   The first Florida spraying against Medflies begins Thursday in a
16-square-mile zone covering areas northwest of downtown Miami and
near Miami International Airport. That's where six of the pests
have been found since April 16.
   Three other sprayings will follow over the next several weeks.
After four weeks, millions of sterile Medflies will be released to
break the breeding cycle.
   The last Medfly infestation in South Florida was in 1987, when
five males were found. The state's last major outbreak affecting
commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956.
   Environmentalists in California and here have objected to use of
malathion, contending too little is known about the chemical's
long-term health effects.
   ``The bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that
they wipe out all of the insects in an area _ the good and the
bad,'' said Lee Emerson, a member of the Sierra Club. ``It's not
the kind of balanced, environmentally sensitive approach we should
be taking these days.''
   Joette Lorion, a Miami coordinator of Earth Day, said, ``If it's
a danger to your car and they're asking you to wipe it off, it must
be a danger to your body.''
   The mixture of malathion and syrupy bait can damage car paint if
not rinsed off quickly.
   Officials also said that people with health problems, such as
asthma or allergies, may want to remain indoors during the
spraying. But Conner said of malathion: ``It has not been
determined anywhere to be a health risk.''
   Medflies could strike a harsh blow to Florida's citrus industry,
which was crippled by a Christmas freeze. Medfly larvae hatch
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables, turning
them into mush.
   Bobby McKown, executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual
in Lakeland, said Monday the 12,000-member growers' organization
supports ``immediate action to control and eradicate the Medflies''
so they don't expand beyond residential areas.
   The pesticide to be sprayed per acre consists of 2.4 ounces of
malathion mixed with sticky bait. Malathion is used in a stronger
concentration of 3.1 ounces per acre throughout Florida for
mosquito control.

<HEAD>Intel Sues Advanced Micro Devices Over Rights To Chip Code</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp., in the latest dispute between
chip industry giants over intellectual property, has sued Advanced
Micro Devices Corp., accusing its rival of copyright infringement.
   Intel, Silicon Valley's largest chipmaker, accuses AMD of
illegally copying software imbedded in Intel chips to produce AMD's
new line of accessory mathematics chips.
   The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, asks the court
to block the sale of the AMD products, impound any illegal copies
of the software, and award unspecified damages.
   Advanced Micro Devices, based in Sunnyvale, called Intel's suit
unfounded and said it has the right to copy the embedded software,
known as microcode, under a 14-year-old technology-sharing
agreement with Intel.
   Intel, based in Santa Clara, once allowed AMD and other
companies to make chips based on Intel designs. Intel believed that
alternative sources would help a prorietary chip design win
acceptance in the market.
   But in an attempt to protect its right as the exclusive maker of
newer chips, Intel has filed several suits against competitors.
   Intel also is involved in a private arbitration proceeding with
AMD over rights to Intel's important 80386 microprocessor chip.
   Two other chip makers, Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. of Japan,
have been embroiled in a 16-month legal battle over trade secrets
that centers on some of their most popular chips. The two companies
formerly were partners in chip development.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is expected to move
production of its sporty Camaro and Firebird cars to Canada from
California, clearing the way for a new kind of GM factory in the
Los Angeles area, a company official said today.
   A news conference was set for this afternoon in Ste. Therese,
Quebec, where GM's Canadian subsidiary now makes the Chevrolet
Lumina coupe and sedan and Oldsmobile Ciera car.
   GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner said in Detroit the company was
expected to announce that production of a new Chevrolet Camaro and
Pontiac Firebird, called F-cars, would be moved to the Canadian
plant from GM's plant in Van Nuys, Calif.
   ``The Van Nuys facility will continue to produce the current
F-car and the timetable for the introduction of the next generation
hasn't been established,'' she said.
   It is expected that the shift will take place in time for the
Ste. Therese plant to begin making Camaros and Firebirds in 1992
for the 1993 model year.
   Sales of Camaros and Firebirds this year through April 20 were
down 35 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively.
   There are about 3,500 employees at the Ste. Therese plant and
about 3,800 at the Van Nuys factory. It was not immediately unclear
how the production shift would affect employment at the two plants.
   In place of the Camaro and Firebird, GM hopes to establish a
``flex plant'' at Van Nuys, Tanner said.
   ``It would be a facility capable of assembling a number of
various models that would allow us to respond more quickly to the
Western market,'' she said. She declined to elaborate.
   Small, sporty cars and sport-utility vehicles are popular in the
West, especially Southern California.

   Soybean futures prices rose sharply today on the
Chicago Board of Trade following news of stronger soybean crushing
activity, while grain futures were mixed.
   The Census Bureau's monthly report on the U.S. soybean crush
showed a larger-than-expected 102.1 million bushels of beans
crushed in March to produce soybean oil and meal.
   The report implies U.S. soybean stocks may be declining more
rapidly than the market had previously believed, said William
Biedermann, research director with the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   Further buying of soybean contracts was linked to rumors that
the Soviet Union is in the market for soybean meal, analysts said.
   Expectations for new export sales of corn helped support the
corn futures. Wheat futures were narrowly mixed.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.68 a bushel;
corn was \ cent to } cent higher with May at $2.76\ a bushel; oats

<HEAD>Cray Research Reports Sharply Higher First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc. reported sharply higher
first-quarter earnings and repeated earlier statements that it
expects its profit for all of 1990 to increase.
   Net income for the first three months of 1990 totaled $9.5
million, or 33 cents a share, compared with earnings of $1.5
million, or 5 cents a share, in 1989's first quarter, the
Minneapolis-based supercomputer maker said Tuesday.
   Revenue for the first quarter totaled $135.9 million, up 17
percent from $116.1 million in the same period of 1989.
   ``We continue to hold the view that revenue will be flat in 1990
but earnings will improve over last year,'' said Marcelo Gumucio,
president and chief operating officer.
   Last year, Cray earned $89 million on revenue of $785 million.
   Cray results typically vary a great deal from quarter to quarter.
   ``One-quarter snapshots of Cray's numbers are not particularly
meaningful,'' said Gary Smaby, an analyst with the
Minneapolis-based Smaby Group.
   But Smaby said the 17 percent revenue increase in the first
quarter does take pressure off the company's usually strong fourth
quarter.
   Cray reported signing orders worth $80 million during the first
quarter, down from $100 million during 1989's first quarter.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. reported Wednesday that its
first-quarter profit declined 16 percent over a year ago,
reflecting expenses from business restructurings and weakness in
the automotive and housing industries.
   For the first three months of 1990, Du Pont earned $615 million,
or 90 cents per share, compared with a profit of $736 million, or
$1.03 a share, n 1989. Sales, though, rose 8 percent to $9.4
billion from $8.7 billion.
   The chemical giant said its latest results were depressed by
several non-recurring charges, principally from business
restructurings.
   Du Pont also said most of its businesses were effected by a
softening in the automotive and housing industries. The company
said its agricultural products were among businesses showing
improved performance over the first quarter of 1989.
   First quarter earnings per share reflected a lower average
number of common shares outstanding as a result of the company's
stock re-purchase program. Since the program began in 1989, the
company has repurchased 44 million shares out of an intended 60
million.
   ``In March, we began to see signs of strengthening in our
businesses as a result of our cost improvement programs,'' said
Chairman Edgar S. Wollard Jr.
   ``We know we'll have our work cut out for us, but we believe we
will extend our four-year trend of steady earnings improvement and
achieve our stated goal of maintaining or exceeding 16 percent
return on equity through a business cycle.''

<HEAD>ITT Posts Higher Earnings After Sale of French Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. reported Wednesday that its
first-quarter profit rose 27 percent over a year ago, due largely
to a $47 million gain from the sale of stock in Paris-based
Compagnie Generale d'Electricite.
   Net income for the first three months of 1990 totaled $253
million, or $1.88 per share, compared with earnings of $200
million, or $1.40 a share, last year.
   Sales were nearly flat, rising 2 percent to $4.93 billion from
$4.83 billion. ITT said revenue results were impacted by the
third-quarter sale of Communications Services Inc.
   ITT said its higher earnings reflected the sale of about 2
million shares of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite in which it
gained about 33 cents per share.
   ITT reported mixed performances in its various divisions, with
declines in electronic components, service businesses, financial
operations and Sheraton hotels. Income at ITT's defense segment
improved as a result of increased contract margins and product
shipments. The pulp and timber division also showed improvement.
   Chairman Rand V. Araskog said he was optimistic about the rest
of the year despite the lower results in some of ITT's businesses
and ``a difficult business environment in the United States.''

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf to CORRECT ``companies'' to ``countries.''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norton Co., which has been fending off a hostile
takeover bid from British conglomerate BTR PLC, said today it
agreed to be acquired by the French firm Compagnie Saint-Gobain in
a deal that values the abrasives manufacturer at around $1.8
billion.
   The $90-a-share cash offer exceeds BTR's bid of $1.6 billion, or
$75 a share, which was rejected last month by Norton's board of
directors.
   Wall Street applauded today's announcement. In active trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, Norton jumped $13.50 to $88.75 a share
by midday.
   The announced merger with Compagnie Saint-Gobain comes a day
after a federal judge ordered Worcester-based Norton to reveal the
amount of a ``white knight'' offer it said it had received last
week.
   The court order came during a hearing on suits filed on behalf
of some Norton shareholders seeking to require Norton to fully and
fairly consider BTR's offer and ``take into consideration the
interest of the shareholders.''
   Norton told the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday
that a third party was interested in buying Norton for more money.
   BTR had planned to wage a proxy fight at Norton's annual
shareholders' meeting set for Thursday.
   But one of Norton's biggest weapons was a new state law that
would prevent BTR from taking immediate control over the Norton
board. The law zoomed through the legislature last week and was
signed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, taking effect immediately. It
permits a Massachusetts corporation to elect only one-third of its
directors at a time, unless the company opts out of the requirement.
   BTR had said it wouldn't back down despite the state law.
   In a statement, Chairman John S. Nelson said, ``Norton has
fought hard to remain independent because we believed this to be
the ideal for all Norton constituencies.''
   But Nelson said a negotiated merger was ``the best alternative''
to a BTR bid, which he termed as inadequate.
   Norton and Saint-Gobain said the merger was conditioned upon
keeping Norton's headquaters and principal manufacturing operations
in Worcester.
   The companies said Norton would continue operating under the
same name and that employee policies and benefits would be
continued at present levels.
   Norton also would remain an autonomous company with a separate
board of directors, they said.
   ``These are the commitments on which we have formed our
partnership, and the merger agreement provides specifically that
these commitments will continue for at least five years,'' Nelson
and Saint-Gobain Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said in a joint
statement.
   According to a statement, at least two-thirds of Norton's 20.37
million common shares outstanding must be tendered before the full
financed cash offer beginning April 30, 1990.
   Norton is the world's largest manufacturer of abrasives and a
leading producer of engineering materials, including advanced
ceramics, performance plastics, and chemical process products.
Norton, which had 1989 sales of approximately $1.5 billion, employs
16,000 people and operates 113 plans in the United States and 25
other countries.
   Saint-Gobain produces a variety of flat glass, fiber glass,
piping, paper and wood products and has annual sales of more than
$11 billion. The Paris-based company employees 88,000 people and
operate 350 plants in the United States and 20 other countries.

   Air Inter announced Wednesday it will ban smoking
on all its domestic flights after a two-month experiment found that
88 percent of passengers favored smoke-free flights.
   The French airline banned smoking on a temporary basis on March
1. The latest announcement said the restriction will be extended
indefinitely, in accordance with the results of a survey conducted
since then.
   Air Inter reported that a poll of 5,500 passengers found that 88
percent thought smoke-free flights are a positive thing, with 96
percent of non-smokers and 72 percent of smokers favoring such a
ban.
   About 36 percent of Air Inter's passengers smoke, the airline
said. Air Inter serves mainly domestic French routes but also
operates some flights to Rome, Lisbon and London.
   A law banning smoking on virtually all domestic flights recently
went into effect in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced today a 9.7 percent increase in the amount of foreign
sugar that can be imported by U.S. processors from 40 countries.
   Yeutter said the increase boosts the sugar import quota to
2,834,865 metric tons for the period Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept.
30, 1990, an increase of 250,000 tons from 2,584,865 tons announced
on Jan. 16.
   The latest quota boost was the fourth for 1989-90. Previous
increases were made last Sept. 12 and Nov. 24.
   Yeutter said ``continued supply-demand imbalances'' forced a
further adjustment in the sugar import quota. The latest figures
included the reinstatement of Nicaragua's share of the U.S. sugar
quota.
   An increase of at least 250,000 tons had been sought by the
Sweetener Users Association, which represents industrial consumers
of sugar and other sweeteners.
   Quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can
enter the United States, thus protecting domestic producers from
lower-priced foreign sugar being dumped on the U.S. market.
   Revised allocations announced by U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills for the period Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept. 30, 1990, in
metric tons of 2,205 pounds each, included:
   Argentina, 112,630.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly lower in European
trading Wednesday as support for the West German mark firmed.
   Gold was lower.
   Dealers said market activity was generally focused on cross-rate
movements between the mark and other currencies, particularly the
British pound and the Japanese yen.
   ``It's as much a switch back into marks as any other factor,''
said Michael James, head of inter-bank dealing for Britain's
Midland Bank.
   The dollar held relatively firm against the yen largely on the
Japanese unit's weakness rather than any substantive move in the
dollar.
   But some dealers suggested firmer long-term U.S. interest rates
helped the dollar by at least creating perceptions that Japanese
investment capital would flow toward the dollar.
   Late in London, the dollar was quoted at 1.6820 marks, down from
1.6930 marks late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.10 yen to a closing 159.25 yen. In
London, it was quoted late Wednesday at 158.59 yen.
   The pound sank following the British announcement of a
merchandise trade deficit of 2.18 billion pounds in March, wider
than 1.39 billion pounds a month earlier. The Bank of England
stepped in to signal support at around $1.6260.
   Sterling finished the day slightly stronger against the dollar,
trading at $1.6370 late Wednesday compared to $1.6345 Tuesday.
   Other late rates compared with late Tuesday's levels were:
1.4665 Swiss francs, down from 1.4865; 5.6455 French francs, down
from 5.6795; 1.8970 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9100; 1,234.00
Italian lire, down from 1,241.00; and 1.1603 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1590.
   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York included: 1.6845
West German marks; 158.945 Japanese yen; 1.4650 Swiss francs;
1.16025 Canadian dollars and 1,233.25 Italian lire.
   Gold traded in London at late a bid of $371.25 a troy ounce,
down from $378.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the late bid was $371,
down from $377.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.02 to close at a bid of
$375.95 per troy ounce.
   Silver fell in London to a bid of $4.97 dollars a troy ounce
from Tuesday's $5.10.

<TEXT>
   An environmentalist group briefly disrupted the
Exxon Corp. annual meeting today while executives told shareholders
the Alaskan shore slimed with oil from the Exxon Valdez should be
cleaned by summer's end.
   ``Very substantial progress has obviously been made,'' Exxon
President Lee R. Raymond said in detailing the cleanup of the worst
oil spill in U.S. history, now a rallying cry for the environmental
movement.
   Raymond cited a ``massive summer-long effort'' last year, the
scouring of winter storms and the application last fall of a
fertilizer to speed the biological decay of the oil.
   In contrast with the roughly 250 demonstrators who attended last
year's annual meeting in New Jersey, about 20 people outside
today's gathering carried signs urging a boycott of Exxon products.
   But later inside while Exxon executives spoke, they were
interrupted when Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife
Federation, took issue with the upbeat review of Exxon's Alaska
operations.
   ``We call that bull---,'' he said, suggesting the damage goes
beyond the environment. ``Listen to the people of Alaska whose
lives have been destroyed and you're putting the profits in your
pockets,'' Hair said, to loud boos from the audience.
   Exxon has come under harsh criticism from environmentalists,
politicians and many shareholders for what was perceived as its
inadequate response to the Alaska disaster, the worst oil spill in
U.S. history.
   The meeting agenda was dominated by the 11 million-gallon spill,
which occurred March 24, 1989, when the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a
reef. Shareholders were scheduled to vote on six environmentally
related resolutions.
   Some environmental groups also have called informally for
Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl to resign, although he is not expected to
do so.
   Demonstrators handed out leaflets suggesting 10 questions
shareholders should ask Exxon management about its response to the
oil spill and other problems.
   Once inside the George R. Brown Convention Center, shareholders
passed through metal detectors and then passed through an elaborate
display called ``Progress in Alaska'' detailing Exxon's cleanup
efforts in Prince William Sound.
   Some of the criticism against Exxon has been over its decision
to reduce activity last September in preparation for Alaska's harsh
winter. One display told shareholders that ``nature takes over the
cleaning job with intense storm activity'' during the fall, winter
and spring.
   Exxon executives said the company will resume full-scale cleanup
within a few weeks after a survey is completed of remaining damage.
Spokesman Henry W. Beathard estimated the job would be finished by
the end of summer.
   Rawl and Raymond each touted Exxon's environmental efforts
during remarks opening the meeting, attended by more than 1,000
shareholders.
   ``In addition to reaffirming our own commitment to safety and
environmental protection, Exxon has been an active participant in
the development of guiding principles for the petroleum and
chemical industries,' Rawl said.
   The company had spent some $2 billion for spill-related expenses
through the end of 1989 and faces possible further costs for civil
and criminal damages linked to the disaster and other oil spills.
   The environment-related shareholder resolutions include pledges
by Exxon to reduce its emissions of pollutants and toxic waste,
create a special environmental affairs committee on its board of
directors and follow the so-called Valdez Principles for corporate
environmental conduct.
   Exxon says all the resolutions are duplicative and unnecessary,
and should be rejected by shareholders.
   Also today, Exxon said it would join other oil companies in
reformulating some of its gasolines to burn cleaner. Exxon said it
would market its gasolines in 40 markets in the East and along the
Gulf Coast. Exxon will sell the reformulated gasoline in the New
York area year-round and in other areas during the summer.

   Share prices closed lower Wednesday on London's

for March.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
16.8 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,143.1.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 13.7 points at

points to close at 1,163.90.
   Volume was 392.8 million shares compared with the 372.9 million
shares Tuesday.
   Shares prices began falling immediately after the government
reported that the merchandise trade deficit soared to 2.18 billion
pounds, or $3.6 billion, in March from 1.39 billion pounds in
February.
   The latest deficit was Britain's second worst ever, and made
traders bearish about the prospects for share prices.

   Existing home sales in March remained below
1989 levels for the second straight month as mortgage interest
rates stayed in the double-digits, a real estate trade group
reported Wednesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.40 million
units, unchanged from the number of sales in February but down from
the 3.52 million rate in January.
   The annual rate for a particular month represents what the total
number of sales for the year would be if the pace were maintained
for 12 consecutive months. During all of 1989, actual sales totaled
3.44 million units.
   Realtors chief economist John A. Tuccillo said the 3.40 million
pace, the slowest since a 3.38 million rate last July, was
sustainable for the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to report new home sales
for March next Monday. New home sales rose 3.1 percent to an annual
rate of 607,000 units in February after plunging 6.8 percent the
previous month.
   But the pace of sales remained below the 649,000 new homes sold
in 1989 and analysts placed the blame on mortgage rates and
declining consumer confidence.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that 30-year
conventional fixed-rate mortgages averaged between 10.22 percent
and 10.34 percent during March, high when compared to the
single-digit rates at the end of 1989.
   The Realtors said the high rates had a dual effect on the
existing home market. Consumer uncertainty triggered purchases by
prospective buyers fearing higher rates in the future while it
curbed sales by others hoping for lower rates in the months ahead.
   ``The rate-watchers who are making their move now tend to be in
less expensive markets,'' said Realtors president Norman D. Flynn.
``Those who are holding back in hopes of rate declines tend to be
in the higher-priced markets.''
   The Realtors said the national median price of existing homes
was $96,100 in March, up $900 from February. The median price of a
new home in February was $130,000, according to the Commerce
Department. The median means that half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   Existing home sales in the Northeast continued to be sluggish in
March, falling 16.9 percent to an annual rate of 490,000 units. The
median price there was $148,200, up 3.3 percent from the previous
month.
   Sales also fell in the West, down 1.5 percent to an annual rate
of 640,000. The median price was $143,300, the same as February's.
   Sales were unchanged at an annual rate of 890,000 units in the
Midwest where the median price was $72,900, down 1.6 percent.
   The South posted the only sales gain, up 3.8 percent to 1.36
million units. The median price was up 0.9 percent to $86,000.

   Norfolk Southern Corp. reported Wednesday
its first-quarter net income rose 4.8 percent on a 2.7 percent
revenue increase.
   The company said its earned $140.2 million, or 84 cents a share,
in the first three months of the year, up from $133.8 million, or
75 cents a share, a year earlier in its previous first-quarter
record.
   First-quarter revenue rose to $1.14 billion from $1.11 billion a
year earlier.
   ``Strong coal traffic has continued into 1990, with coal, coke
and iron ore revenues up 11.1 percent over last year,'' Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Arnold B. McKinnon said.
   The higher ore traffic more than offset a 1.3 percent drop in
merchandise revenues and a 2.4 percent decline in revenues from the
company's North American Van Lines subsidiary, McKinnon said.
   He said revenue rose 7 percent in agricultural commodities, 5.4
percent for chemicals and 2.6 percent for paper.

   Capitol Hill is aflutter and abuzz with
lobbying campaigns by friends of the monarch butterfly and the
honeybee.
   Advocates of each critter say the United States is long past due
for a national insect. There is a national bird, the bald eagle, so
let's have a national bug, they say.
   So far, the House and Senate have not been pushed into deciding.
But the Entomological Society of America, which observed its 100th
year in 1989, is working on behalf of the monarch butterfly.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., has introduced a butterfly bill in
the House and has added 16 co-sponsors. But Rep. Stephen L. Neal,
D-N.C., has a honeybee measure waiting that has 38 co-sponsors.
   In the Senate, no champion of the butterfly has stepped forth,
says Douglas W.S. Sutherland, chairman of the society's national
insect subcommittee.
   ``We're looking, but so far we haven't had any luck,''
Sutherland said Tuesday.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., has a honeybee bill and a number of
cosponsors. Pressler and others point to the honeybee's valuable
contributions to agriculture as a crop pollinator as well as a
provider of honey.
   That's the story in the House, too, where John Taylor, an aide
to Neal, said their bill would recognize the importance of
beekeepers and bees as ``an integral part'' of U.S. agriculture.
   ``I think the strength of our (bill) is that the bee is such a
big part of agriculture,'' Taylor said. ``The bee pollinates the
food that you and I eat.''
   According to the Agriculture Department, U.S. honeybees produce
about 250 million pounds of honey and unintentionally pollinate
more than 90 cultivated crops with a combined annual value of
billions of dollars.
   Sutherland, an entomologist for the Environmental Protection
Agency, said Tuesday that he recognized the honeybee's important
role in agriculture but thinks the monarch deserves the national
title.
   The society's membership of about 2,000 voted on which insect to
support, and the familiar orange-and-black monarch came out on top,
followed by the tiger swallow-tail butterfly, a large yellow
species.
   Sutherland said the convergent lady beetle was third among the
society's members, and the honeybee was fourth. Overall, he said,
the two butterflies received more than 70 percent of the vote.
   The monarch's appeal partly stems from its wide range over the
United States, he said. The swallow-tail, on the other hand, is not
found in all states.
   Sutherland said the monarch is a benign, native American
creature that feeds on milkweed and harms no one. Eastern varieties
migrate to an area in the mountains southwest of Mexico City, while
the western monarchs flock to the California coast, he said.
   Lobbying help for the monarch is forming among garden clubs,
many school children and others, Sutherland said.
   ``A healthy environment for the monarch is a healthy environment
for everybody, basically,'' he said.

   The Senate Agriculture Committee has voted to
extend current government programs for wool, mohair and honey for
five years with virtually no changes.
   ``The wool and mohair title (of the 1990 farm bill) is
essentially a five-year extension of the program for wool in the
1985 farm bill,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Tuesday.
   The measure:
   _Authorizes loans, purchases and payments by the Agriculture
Department to help the wool and mohair industry.
   _Sets a payment rate that would be the difference between the
national average of all domestic wool receipts and the price the
government predetermined that producers should get. Each producer's
payment from the government would be calculated by applying this
rate to net proceeds for wool sold the preceding year.
   The honey section of the farm bill also would be little changed
from current policies.
   The price support for honey has dropped an average 5 percent
each year for five years. Under the new legislation, support prices
would be frozen at 56.86 cents a pound through 1995.
   Loan repayment rates would be unchanged.

<HEAD>Tenneco's Profit Up 23 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. reported a 23 percent increase in
earnings for the first quarter as revenue rose.
   The diversified energy company said Tuesday it earned $134
million, or $1.03 a share, in the first three months of the year,
up from $109 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue increased 8.4 percent to $3.6 billion from
$3.32 billion.
   ``The first-quarter results in total are in line with
expectations,'' said James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's chairman. ``Those
divisions with lower operating income in this year's first quarter
were all budgeted to be lower than 1989.
   ``Our goals for 1990 remain to increase earnings per share by at
least 15 percent, achieve a 20 percent rate of return on
shareholders' equity and generate cash flow from our industrial
operations in excess of our capital expenditures and dividend
requirements.''
   Among the company's divisions, earnings from the natural gas
pipeline segment were down 22 percent at $90 million. Tenneco
attributed the decline to warm weather.
   The farm and construction equipment division jumped to $48
million from $1 million, mainly because of higher sales volumes and
prices.
   Tenneco's automotive operating income was $42 million, down from
$49 million in the first quarter of 1989. Its Newport News
Shipbuilding operations had earnings of $45 million, up from $30
million.
   Operating income for the chemicals and minerals businesses was
$40 million in the first quarter, up from $32 million a year
earlier. Packaging Corp. of America had income of $42 million, down
$10 million from last year.

<HEAD>Net Income Up Nearly 15 Percent for Fiscal 3rd Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   CHICAGO (AP ) _ Sara Lee Corp. reported a 14.6 percent increase
in its fiscal third-quarter net income Wednesday despite a slight
decline in overall sales and a poor performance from its namesake
bakery division.
   A company spokeswoman and an industry analyst both said the weak
sales of Sara Lee's packaged meats and bakery products partly
reflected increased consumer preference for breakfast cereal.
   ``People are eating cereal more than bacon and eggs and danish
and bagels,'' said analyst Roger Spencer of PaineWebber Inc.
   Chicago-based Sara Lee reported net income of $108.9 million, or
44 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31 compared with
$95 million, or 40 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter fell 1.3 percent to $2.8 billion from
$2.84 billion, reflecting both the disposition of some of Sara
Lee's food-service businesses at the beginning of fiscal 1990 and a
9 percent drop in bakery unit volume after a 10 percent increase in
last year's comparable quarter, Sara Lee said in a statement.
   Unit volume refers to the amount of product shipped as opposed
to revenue, which refers to the dollars received from the sale of
goods.
   Sales for Sara Lee's packaged meats and bakery division fell
13.5 percent to $1.2 billion and operating income for the unit
plunged 25 percent to $45.2 billion.
   The division's poor performance was offset by a 2 percent sales
increase and a 48 percent gain in operating income from the
company's coffee and grocery division, and by increases of 14
percent in both sales and operating income for Sara Lee's packaged
consumer products division.
   Company spokeswoman Anne McCarthy said bakery sales should
improve with the planned introduction of new products in the second
quarter. She said Sara Lee's recently introduced ``light'' baked
goods have been successful.
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1990, net income rose 14
percent to $352 million, or $1.40 per share, from $307.8 million,
or $1.32 per share, in the first nine months of fiscal 1989.
   Sales for the three quarters totaled $8.65 billion compared with
$8.66 billion for the same period a year earlier.
   In addition to its baked goods, Sara Lee markets a variety of
brand name products including Hanes underwear, L'eggs hoisery,
Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean meats, Douwe Egberts coffee and Kiwi
shoe polish.

<HEAD>Surging Soybeans Lead Rise In Crop Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by a surging
soybean market amid bullish news surrounding developments in the
Soviet Union.
   Traders heaved ``a collective sigh of relief'' that President
Bush had chosen not to impose economic sanctions against the Soviet
Union in retaliation for Moscow's crackdown on Lithuanian
independence, said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc., a brokers' advisory service.
   Some traders had feared the U.S. would limit grain sales to the
Soviets.
   Rumors of Soviet interest in soybean meal added further support,
as did perceptions that Tuesday's steep drop in precious metal
prices reflected Soviet selling of gold to get hard currency for
more grain and soybean purchases, Karlin said.
   The Census Bureau's monthly report Tuesday on the U.S. soybean
crush was also supportive. It showed a larger-than-expected 102.1
million bushels of beans crushed in March to produce soybean oil
and meal.
   The report implied U.S. soybean stocks may be declining more
rapidly than the market had previously believed, said William
Biedermann, research director with the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 3\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.71 a bushel; corn
futures were 2} cents to 4 cents higher with May at $2.79 a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher with May at $1.58} a bushel;
and soybeans were 8} cents to 13} cents higher with May at $6.09{ a
bushel.

<HEAD>March Construction Contracts Up 4 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Hold for release at 6:30 p.m. EDT _ time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts for new construction rose 3 percent
nationwide in March, reversing a five-month slide of building
activity that had been concentrated in the Northeast, the F.W.
Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Inc. reported Wednesday.
   The Dodge Index, which uses 1982 as its base of 100, increased
to 156 in March from 150 in February, although it remained well off
its most recent peak of 181 reached last September.
   The yearly pace of total contracting was $244.97 billion last
month, up from $235.96 billion in February.
   March's improved rate reflected a 15 percent surge in
non-residential projects. Homebuilding construction eased 2
percent, while public works and utilities projects fell 1 percent.
   ``With the exception of offices, March contracts for
non-residential construction revealed a general strengthening of
commerical, industrial and institutional building,'' said George A.
Christie, vice president and chief economist of F.W. Dodge.
   Institutional building, which includes construction of schools
and health-care facilities, was up 29 percent in March, partly due
to two large hospital renovation projects in the New York area.
   For the first three months of 1990, construction contracting
trailed 1989's first quarter value by 6 percent.
   The Northeast, where contracting has fallen off in recent
months, showed the biggest decline in building activity, off 25
percent from the previous year's quarter. The South lagged percent
over the 1989 quarter.
   Posting modest gains were the North-Central region, where
building activity rose 5 percent, and the West, with a 3 percent
increase.

   The stock market showed a moderate gain today,
bidding to reverse a week-long decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 111.27 points over
the past five sessions, rose 15.32 to 2,669.82 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange issues, with 765 up, 631 down and 536
unchanged.
   Analysts said prices appeared to have fallen far enough in their
recent slide to attract some buyers looking for ``bargains.''
   But they questioned how far a rally could go without signs of a
significant easing in upward pressure on interest rates.
   Yields on government bonds, which tend to influence the over-all
level of long-term interest rates, have climbed lately to near 9
percent, the highest they have been in nearly a year.
   That development has dampened hopes that corporate profits might
improve in the months ahead.
   Norton Co. led the active list, up 13{ at 88}. The company,
which has been opposing a takeover bid from the British
conglomerate BTR PLC, said it agreed to be acquired by Compagnie
Saint-Gobain of France for $90 a share.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up ~ at 109}; General Electric, up &lsqb; at 64{; Sears
Roebuck, up | at 36, and Philip Morris, up { at 42&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of more than 1,500 common stocks
gained .86 to 182.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .03 at 343.92.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110.33 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>America West Blames First-Quarter Loss on Higher Fuel Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines said Wednesday the
higher price of jet fuel in the first three months of the year was
the main factor behind its $2.6 million net loss for the quarter.
   America West, the nation's 10th-largest airline, said it was its
first quarterly loss after seven consecutive quarters in the black.
   The airline said the loss of $2.6 million, or 17 cents a share,
compared with net income of $10.1 million, or 58 cents a share, in
the first quarter of 1989. The year-earlier results included a $7.4
million gain from the sale of foreign tax benefits related to
aircraft acquisition.
   First-quarter revenue rose 30.8 percent to $304.8 million from
$233.1 million.
   ``The sharp rise in fuel prices left America West, as well as
the entire airline industry, with disappointing results for the
first quarter 1990,'' said Al Frei, America West's chief financial
officer. ``America West's fuel expenses for the 1990 quarter
increased approximately $9 million over the corresponding 1989
quarter.''
   ``Increased payroll expense, travel agency commissions and
catering costs also added to higher operating expenses,'' Frei
added.
   The airline said the price it paid for jet fuel rose 22 percent
_ from 58 cents a gallon to 71 cents _ in the last year.
   Frei and America West Chairman Edward R. Beauvais predicted that
the quarterly slump would be short-lived. They cited a 2.9 percent
gain in load factor, or number of available seats occupied, despite
a 30 percent increase in capacity from the year-earlier quarter.
   ``Continued strengthening of our traffic and subsiding fuel
prices leave us very optimistic for positive results in the second
quarter and the balance of the year,'' Beauvais said.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. reported on Wednesday
record profits and sales in the first quarter of 1990, but still
received a healthy dose of criticism at its annual meeting.
   The world's largest brewer said it earned $182.5 million, or 64
cents a share, in the latest quarter, up 9 percent from $167.1
million, or 58 cents a share, for the same period in 1989.
   Sales were up 8 percent, including a nearly 3 percent rise in
barrels of beer sold, in the quarter, to $2.59 billion compared
with $2.39 billion in 1989's first quarter.
   Despite the favorable report, August Busch III, chairman and
president of the company, spent much of his time at the annual
meeting defending the company in both prepared remarks and answers
to stockholders' questions.
   He defended the company's decision to cut its prices to match
competitors' prices, a move that stock analysts said was
Anheuser-Busch's attempt to speed up its effort to reach 50 percent
market share by the mid-1990s.
   ``This does not mean we are trying to start a price war in the
brewing industry,'' Busch said.
   Anheuser-Busch increased its market share in 1989 to 42 percent
of the market from about 40 percent in 1988. One out of every four
beers sold in the United States is a Budweiser, according to the
company.
   The chairman also defended the Anheuser-Busch's efforts to
prevent beer from being linked in any way to illegal drugs and
praised the various programs the company sponsors to urge
responsible beer drinking.
   ``We will continue to do everything we can to ensure that beer
plays a positive role in our society,'' Busch told the about 3,200
stockholders at the meeting.
   The company was also criticized for flooding the market with too
many brands _ 17 at last count _ and for spending too much money
promoting already popular beers.
   With three new products being launched this year already _ Busch
Light, Bud Dry and the non-alcoholic O'Doul's _ Busch agreed that
``our plates, to say the least, are full.'' But he said there's no
way around it.
   ``Proliferation of brands is somewhat disturbing to all of us.
If we had our druthers, and we don't, we would sell one product,''
Busch said. ``But that isn't how the marketplace today works.''
   Unless the company keeps coming up with new beers, new packages,
new shelf space, market share and profits will be lost, Busch said.
   Anheuser-Busch, which gets 80 percent of its revenues from beer
and beer-related sales, also owns Campbell Taggart Inc., the second
largest commercial baker in the country, and the baseball team, the
St. Louis Cardinals.
   The company is also the country's second largest theme-park
operator with Busch Gardens and Sea World.

<HEAD>Specialty Department Store Chain Founded in 1924 Sold for $1.5
Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Saks Sale Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC on Wednesday announced the
sale of the Saks Fifth Avenue specialty department store chain to
an international investment group for $1.5 billion.
   Here is a brief history of the retailer:
   _ The idea for what has become the Saks chain originated with
Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel, who independently operated stores
in New York City in the early part of this century. The two
merchants decided to open a fashionable specialty department store
catering to affluent customers. The store on Fifth Avenue opened
Sept. 15, 1924.
   _ From 1924 to 1969, Saks expanded and built a national
recognition as an upscale retailer, mainly of higher priced apparel.
   _ Bernard Gimbel's cousin, Adam, became president after the
sudden death of Horace Saks in 1926. Under Adam Gimbel, branch
stores were opened and the flagship Manhattan store was redecorated
in the opulent Art Moderne style from the 1925 Paris Exposition.
   _ Adam Gimbel retired as Saks president in 1969. At the time,
there were 21 Saks stores.
   _ Saks in 1973 was bought by BATUS Inc., the U.S. holding
company of the London-based conglomerate BAT Industries PLC.
   _ Under BAT's ownership, Saks has grown to include 45 stores
operating in 30 major markets in 20 states. States in which there
are Saks stores include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Louisana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. A 46th store in Houston that has
performed poorly is being closed while three new Saks are to be
opened by the end of 1990.
   _ The flagship Fifth Avenue store was proclaimed a New York City
landmark in 1965.
   _ BAT announced in September 1989 plans to sell Saks, its sister
retailing operations, plus certain other assets as part of a
strategy to thwart an unsolicited takeover attempt by an investment
group led by the Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The
group on April 23 dropped its $22 billion bid but BAT said it would
continue its restructuring and asset sales.
   _ Saks management announced March 15, 1990 that it had submitted
a bid for the chain. The buyout proposal was made jointly with Tobu
Department Store Co. Ltd. of Japan.
   _ The sale of its Breuner's furniture retail and rental
subsidiaries were announced by BAT on March 27 and April 2,
respectively. Negotiations continue for the sale of Ivey's, a
specialty department store chain with 23 stores in the Carolinas
and Florida.
   _ BAT announced on April 19 that it had agreed to sell Saks'
sister retailer, Chicago-based Marshall Field &amp; Co., to Dayton
Hudson Corp. for $1.04 billion.
   _ BAT on April 25 announced it has accepted a bid of $1.5
billion for Saks from Investcorp, an international investment bank
with a wide range of retail and other holdings. The bid was one of
a handful of final proposals for the chain.
   _ In commenting on its acquisition, Investcorp said it will keep
all existing Saks stores open for business and will carry on
current expansion and renovation plans. Benefits for Saks'
employees will be continued at current levels.
   _ Paul Soldatos, a member of Investcorp's management committee
that led the effort to buy Saks, said the group relies on
professional managers to run businesses. He said in an interview
that Investcorp will meet with Saks management as soon as possible
to discuss the future. He said no meeting had taken place yet
because Saks' management had been competing in the auction.

   Far from the boardroom battles between
Carl Icahn and USX Corp. over the bottom line on steel, the Steel
Valley is bottoming out.
   This town's mammoth mill forged the locks for the Panama Canal,
the girders for the Golden Gate Bridge, the beams for the Empire
State Building, the wheels for Disneyland rides and the armor plate
that crushed Hitler and Hirohito.
   But after more than a century of steelmaking, it was shuttered
in 1986 as part of a corporate overhaul. It is an icon of the
smokestack age and a way of life extinct.
   About 9,000 people were employed here a decade ago. Wreckers
toil at the Homestead Works now, like scavengers picking innards of
a carcass.
   The last of five generations of steelworkers who witnessed the
demolition talk caustically about Wall Street raiders and corporate
revamping.
   ``Ninety-nine out of 100 people who lost their jobs see it as
the wrangling between two sharks who have already eaten them,''
said Mike Stout, 40, an ex-steelworker who runs a printing shop.
``They are extremely bitter. They feel betrayed. They want nothing
to do with U.S. Steel ever again.''
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder with 13.3 percent of its stock,
sees steel as a drain on the company's Marathon Oil Co. and Texas
Oil and Gas Corp.
   Last year, energy accounted for 65 percent of business for USX,
which changed its name from U.S. Steel four years ago and remains
the nation's largest steelmaker. Ten years ago, steel was 70
percent of sales.
   Icahn envisions a separate entity called U.S. Steel Co., of
which 80 percent would be peddled to USX shareholders. USX
executives oppose the idea, though they agreed to hold a nonbinding
shareholder vote May 7.
   But to the laborers who once felt the open hearth furnaces cook
through their steel-toed shoes, splitting the company would be a
meaningless formality. For them, the furnaces are no longer an
eternal flame.
   ``People sort of accept it as fact that U.S. Steel is going to
be chopped up,'' said Bob Anderson, a former steelworker who runs
Homestead's Rainbow Kitchen, a food, job and clothing bank.
   ``They've already dismembered the plants. Now they're going to
dismember the corporation,'' Anderson said. ``It could be the final
nail in the coffin, the death of a way of life. It's not the Steel
Valley anymore. We're an industrial graveyard.''
   As proof of changing times, a fantasy-like oasis has sprouted
amid the ashes. The Sandcastle amusement park beckons visitors with
water slides, sandy beach and wooden boardwalk. It adjoins the
bankrupt Mesta Machine Corp., once the world's largest maker of
steelmaking equipment.
   The region was called Steel Valley because hulking mills
sprouted along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh. The river
network and direct access to coal fields made it an ideal place for
steel, basic metal of the 20th century.
   The valley also was the backbone of U.S. Steel, the world's
first billion- dollar corporation. Some of capitalism's wealthiest
barons forged the company out of a 1901 debt-financed megadeal that
was the biggest acquisition in history up to that point. In today's
dollars, the $1.4 billion deal would be worth about $23 billion and
would dwarf most of today's mergers.
   The centerpiece was Andrew Carnegie's mills in the Steel Valley,
which merged with seven other steel companies and John
Rockefeller's iron mines through J.P. Morgan's financing.
   The company prospered. So did legions of Slavs, Poles, Italians,
Irish and German immigrant laborers, drawing steady paychecks to
raise families.
   But the raw and brutal work had a price _ the whistles, hisses,
rumbles, the stench of sulphur, eyesores of slag heaps, rivers that
ran like industrial sewers and air so dirty it blotted out the sun
while street lights burned in the afternoon.
   Today, Renaissance Pittsburgh is a corporate center with a
gleaming skyline, service-based industry, clean air and rivers.
Rand McNally rated it the nation's most liveable place in 1986, and
it is now ranked third.
   But in steel's heyday, muckraking author Lincoln Steffens
recoiled at the belching furnaces and called the area ``hell with
the lid off.''
   When asked how the city could spruce itself up in the 1940s,
architect Frank Lloyd Wright said, ``Abandon it.''
   Back then, U.S. Steel was more than just a job or a profit-loss
statement. It was a paternal entity that dominated local politics,
determined land use, paid most of the taxes and built libraries,
gyms and music halls.
   The company and its predecessors also had their own security.
Hired guns often battled union organizers. In 1892, 10 people were
killed and scores injured when 300 armed Pinkerton guards fired on
strikers at Carnegie's Homestead Works.
   U.S. Steel fused with all aspects of life, even the sporting and
spiritual. Its logo adorns the helmets of Pittsburgh's pro football
team, the Steelers. A stained glass window in a Homestead church
pictures steel being poured.
   ``Everybody in one way or another depended on U.S. Steel. It was
everybody's safety net,'' said Jo DeBolt, director of the Steel
Industry Heritage Task Force, which hopes to salvage part of the
cadaver of Homestead Works as a museum.
   ``Imagine spending your whole life doing something you're proud
of and all at once it's gone. People lost their sense of place. If
you live in the Steel Valley and you don't make steel anymore, what
are you?'' Mrs. DeBolt said.
   The safety net disintegrated in the 1980s. Failure to modernize,
sweetheart labor deals and imports contributed to the collapse.
Steel Valley became the symbolic capital of the rust bowl.
   In 1979, 26,000 people worked for U.S. Steel in the valley.
Today about 4,000 toil at three remaining plants.
   The only steelmaking plant is the Edgar Thomson Works, built in
1875 as Carnegie's first mill. He named it for the president of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, the biggest customer of Carnegie's rails.
   The overhaul made USX leaner and meaner. It takes less time and
labor costs to make steel. But it came with a social cost: USX sold
or closed 15 plants or mining operations in the past 10 years,
including Homestead.
   Overall, the region around Steel Valley lost 100,000
manufacturing jobs and 30 percent of its population. Workers sought
jobs elsewhere in the biggest industrial dislocation of the decade.
   For those who stayed, the main industry became survival.
   A survey sponsored last year by the United Steelworkers of
America showed 40 percent of the workers remain jobless. Those who
found work take home 40 percent to 68 percent less than their steel
wages.
   To help, Allegheny County Mental Health created a program called
Bridge to Recovery in 1986. It is run by Lois Brown, 40, an
ex-steelworker whose father worked 40 years in a steel mill and
whose grandfather worked in a tin mill. Her daughter works for USX.
   ``For many of the people affected, it's too painful to think
about. This was a way of life almost from the beginning of time.
Now there's nothing left. It's like it never existed,'' Mrs. Brown
said.
   Still, for many remaining USX workers, the battle with Icahn is
worrisome. Although they have no love for USX and still smart from
a six-month lockout four years ago, the hard hats tend to align
themselves with the company.
   ``We know USX. We'd rather deal with the devil than the
unknown,'' said Gary Hubbard of the USW, whose ranks have declined
to 700,000, half its all-time peak.
   ``We are very much opposed to mergers and acquisitions for no
other purpose than to saddle healthy companies with a huge debt
burden,'' he said. ``The workers always pay the price.''
   The jitters are worst among those working at the remnants of
Steel Valley.
   ``The bombs are going to go off,'' Barney Oursler of the Mon
Valley Unemployed Committee said of the corporate haggling. ``All
they can hope for is they can duck so they don't get killed in the
explosion.''

   The stock market halted a week-long decline with
a modest advance today.
   Analysts said prices appeared to have fallen far enough in their
recent slide to attract some buyers looking for ``bargains.''
   But they questioned how far a rally could go without signs of a
significant easing in upward pressure on interest rates.
   Yields on government bonds, which tend to influence the over-all
level of long-term interest rates, have climbed lately to near 9
percent, the highest they have been in nearly a year.
   That development has dampened hopes that corporate profits might
improve in the months ahead.

   Oil prices tumbled Wednesday amid heavy selling
motivated by technical market forces and speculation that sluggish
demand will not soak up much of the supply glut.
   Some of the heaviest selling occured in the gasoline futures
pits on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline plunged 1.79
cents to 62.60 cents a gallon, reversing course after several days
of advances. The contract had gained 0.85 cent on Tuesday. Unleaded
gasoline contracts for delivery further in the future also ended
lower.
   The contract for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, dropped 34 cents to $18.66 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling
7 cents on Tuesday. Contracts for later delivery also posted losses.
   The May contract of wholesale home heating oil fell 0.25 cent to
52.40 cents a gallon after settling 0.47 cent lower on Tuesday. The
June, July and August contracts ended with steeper declines.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.552 per
million British thermal units, down from $1.555 on Tuesday.
   Analysts said the slide in unleaded gasoline prices appeared to
be a correction after a recent runup. They said there wasn't any
fundamental supply or demand news on which to pin the selloff.
   Energy market analysts said prices generally remain under
pressure from bearish supply estimates. A weekly report released
late Tuesday after the market closed showed crude oil stocks rose
1.2 million barrels last week, adding to an already abundant
inventory.
   Although the report from the American Petroleum Institute was
unsurprising, analysts said it reinforced the notion that supplies
will significantly exceed expected demand in the near future.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to French Merger in Takeover Fight With British</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After weeks of fighting off hostile
advances from a British conglomerate, Norton Co. said Wednesday it
had agreed to a $1.8 billion merger with a French firm.
   News of Norton's proposed $90-a-share merger with Compagnie
Saint-Gobain sent Norton's stock sharply higher on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Norton's stock rose $13.37{ a share to $88.62{ and was the most
active issue on the exchange with more than 4.5 million shares
traded.
   The offer tops the $1.6 billion, $75-a-share offer from BTR PLC,
the British company that had been pursuing Norton.
   BTR responded to the proposed merger by announcing it is
withdrawing its bid to put three people on Norton's board of
directors, but is extending its offer to May 3. The extension is in
case the Norton-Saint-Gobain merger goes sour, said a BTR spokesman
in New York city who declined to give his name.
   ``Essentially, we're pleased by it (the higher bid),'' the
spokesman said. ``We're 4.9 percent shareholders of Norton.''
   Chairman John S. Nelson said Norton decided to take the
Paris-based company's offer to avert a long and potentially bloody
battle with BTR.
   ``Given the increasing risk of the worst alternative for all
constituencies _ fighting a war of attrition only to be bought in
the end by BTR for an inadequate price with no protection for
employees and the Worcester community _ we have concluded that a
negotiated merger ... is the best alternative,'' Nelson said in a
statement.
   ``Saint-Gobain is a real strategic partner for Norton. Aside
from the fact that it's offered a premium price for the company, it
understands Norton's businesses, it believes in research and
development,'' said Andrea Priest, a New York-based spokeswoman for
Norton.
   Analyst Alvin Donius of New York-based Altman, Brenner Wasserman
agreed the two companies were a good match.
   Norton is a leading manufacturer of abrasives and engineering
materials, including advanced ceramics, performance plastics and
chemical process products. It had 1989 sales of approximately $1.5
billion, employs 16,000 people and operates 113 plants in the U.S.
and 25 other countries.
   Saint-Gobain produces a variety of flat glass, fiber glass,
piping, paper and wood products with annual sales of more than $11
billion. It employs 88,000 people and operates 350 plants.
   ``I think that it's an ideal situation for Norton and
Saint-Gobain,'' Donius said. ``There is great synergy _ technology,
research and development, manufacturing _ the whole nine yards.''
   Although Saint-Gobain's offer was considerably higher than
BTR's, Donius said he believes the French firm can afford the
expense.
   The merger, which requires tender of at least two-thirds of
Norton's common shares before April 30, delighted Norton employees,
who had banded together to fight the takeover after BTR's offer in
March. Employees held frequent rallies, published a daily
newsletter and lobbied for legislation to make the takeover more
difficult.
   After Wednesday's announcement, Norton employees went out into
the company parking lot for an impromptu rally to celebrate their
apparent escape from BTR, who they were convinced would have
decimated the Worcester company.
   ``The mood is great,'' said Tom Morrison, an organizer of a
group formed by employees to fight BTR's hostile takeover bid.
   ``We're really proud of what we did. Things are really good.
Hopefully, BTR's going away and this company we're setting up with
seems to be a very good move,'' he said.
   The proposed merger announcement came a day after a federal
judge ordered Norton to reveal the amount of an offer the company
said it received last week. Norton told the Securities and Exchange
Commission last Friday that a third party was interested in buying
Norton for more money than BTR.
   The company's regular shareholders meeting is Thursday.
   Conditions of the merger included keeping the Norton name and
leaving its headquarters and principal manufacturing operations in
Worcester. The companies said employee policies and benefits would
continue at present levels and Norton would retain a separate board
of directors.
   Saint-Gobain chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said he made the
agreement to expand his company's U.S. business interests and also
because ``we did not want to see it (Norton) dismembered or
subjected to debt that would interfere with its strategic plans.''

<HEAD>Holiday Inns Reorganizing, Cutting 600 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holiday Inns Inc. announced Wednesday it
will eliminate 600 jobs as it reorganizes its hotel management
efforts into separate divisions overseeing franchise operations and
its company-owned hotels.
   The company, purchased by the British brewery and hotel
conglomerate Bass PLC in February, plans to concentrate on its
primary business: hotels.
   ``We have the most recognizable hotel brand in the world, and we
are going to focus all our efforts on building it,'' Chairman Bryan
D. Langton said. ``This will mean we will discontinue all secondary
or satellite businesses.''
   The changes include the resignation of Kenneth B. Hamlet as
president and chief executive officer of the hotel division,
Langton said.
   The company is eliminating 260 jobs its Hotel Services Division,
which buys the furnishings for Holiday Inns motel rooms. About 210
jobs will be lost in the Holiday Clubs division, Langton said in a
statement.
   Holiday Inns is cutting 50 jobs in its administrative
headquarters in Memphis and getting rid of 80 positions in its
international business section.
   Bass opened international headquarters for Holiday Inns in
Atlanta last month, shortly after it completed the $2.2 billion
acquisition of the hotel chain.
   Holiday Corp. shareholders overwhelmingly approved the sale
about three years after Bass became involved in the business by
buying eight European Holiday Inns.
   Bass, which has more than 7,300 pubs and restaurants in the
United Kingdom and brews a variety of beers _ including Bass and
Carling Black Label _ sought the Holiday Inns in an effort to
establish itself as an international force in the hotel industry.
   Holiday Inns have 1,589 hotels and 318,012 rooms in 52 countries
around the world.

<HEAD>When This Credit Rater Says Jump, States Ask How High</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He can strike fear deep into the hearts of the
most financially acrobatic state and municipal treasurers because
of his power to shape the bottom lines of their budgets.
   Hyman C. Grossman, who evaluates their fiscal health for
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., demonstrated that clout last month when he
told New York's budget makers he didn't like the state's numbers.
The influential rating agency downgraded New York's credit standing.
   The move jolted New York's byzantine budget process, causing
Republicans and Democrats alike to repent for years of effective
deficit spending and work toward a true balanced budget.
   The sudden conversion to the cause of fiscal probity didn't come
cheap. The rating move is expected to cost the state's taxpayers
$180 million in higher debt interest payments over the next four
years.
   ``Someone once called us ... a fourth branch of government,''
Grossman says. It's not a label he likes, though. He stresses that
the agency tries to keep its distance from public officials to
guarantee a dispassionate view of government finances.
   ``We're an important link in moving financing from the
government to the ultimate investor really,'' Grossman says.
``We're kind of an umpire. We've got to call it as we see it.''
   Grossman constantly speaks in the plural voice, emphasizing that
he doesn't sit alone behind the plate. The company's municipal
department has 120 analysts, and every major borrower is reviewed
by a committee of at least five people.
   ``A major rating change has to be pretty close to unanimous,''
he says.
   But as managing director of criteria and rating policy, he sets
the pace for the department. He also chairs the rating committees
for several key borrowers, including New York state and city, New
Jersey, Florida and Texas.
   Grossman, 55, has been making calls on state and local
government finances for 27 years at S&amp;P. He's seen everything from
the near bankruptcy of New York City in the mid-1970s to the big
state surpluses of the mid '80s to the shortfalls currently
plaguing many state treasurers, particularly in the Northeast.
   He says the pressures facing the states today are serious. The
federal government has cut back sharply on aid for social services,
transportation and water treatment.
   At the same time, sluggish economies have curbed the growth of
income and sales tax revenues, and corporate taxes aren't picking
up the slack.
   The debt-financed takeover boom of the 1980s has hurt state
coffers by substituting tax-deductible debt for equity. The record
$25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco, for example, probably will cost
North Carolina $100 million in lost income this year, one quarter
of its budget shortfall, Grossman says.
   As New York state seeks to cope with a projected $1.5 billion
shortfall, Grossman has suggested the state consider an income tax
surcharge. But he dismisses the idea that S&amp;P tries to dictate
policy.
   ``We're not necessarily advocates of higher taxes or lower taxes
or more or less spending. But we are advocates of ... credible and
balanced financial operations,'' he says.
   There's a fine line between dictating specific policies and
pushing for change, though. Grossman was well aware of the
political impact of a rating change when his team voted to
downgrade New York after repeatedly expressing concern about the
state's accumulated deficits and a yawning budget gap for the
latest fiscal year.
   ``Frankly, if you express concern, concern, concern and you keep
the rating, you don't change policy. And we felt that policy needed
to be changed. Not that we're dictating policy. But the only way
attention could be called to this credit deterioration was to
change the rating.''
   The decision dropped the state's rating by two notches to
single-A, the third lowest among the states after lowly Louisiana
and Massachusetts. Telephoning state officials with the news was
``not easy, but it's part of our job,'' Grossman says.
   Budget director Dall W. Forsythe said the state was surprised by
the two-notch drop, and that S&amp;P didn't wait until legislators and
the executive had agreed on a budget package.
   ``We disagree ... on some of their judgments and decisions,'' he
said. But he didn't challenge Grossman's expertise. ``He is a very
knowledgeable professional,'' he says.
   Rating governments is a natural for Grossman, who has a lifelong
interest in public policy.
   A New York City native, Grossman studied political science at
New York University and became active in local Democratic politics.
He spent one year in law school but left to marry in 1960 and earn
a living on Wall Street.
   He served as council president in his hometown of Marlboro
Township in the New Jersey suburbs from 1977 to 1981. (The council
agreed at the outset not to seek a rating from S&amp;P if it borrowed
during the period, which it didn't.)
   As a member of the Governmental Accounting Standards Advisory
Council, Grossman is helping to revise accounting guidelines for
public bodies across the country.
   Assessing the creditworthiness of a state or municipality is
more complex and subjective than rating a corporation, Grossman
says. You can't just look at widget sales and debt payment
schedules. The rater has to judge the political process that
produces the budget.
   ``You develop a credibility assessment of the government you're
dealing with,'' Grossman says. In New York's case, years of
papering over the deficit with one-shot financing deals wore
credibility too thin, he says.
   Grossman also emphasizes the strength or weakness of an area's
underlying economy, something Forsythe says distinguishes S&amp;P from
its chief rival, Moody's Investors Service. Grossman doesn't like
computer models, though. He relies on his nose for anecdotal
evidence.
   On a trip to Austin, Texas, for example, he dropped into a real
estate broker's office and was startled to find the office vacancy
rate was 38 percent, hardly a robust indicator.
   Two weeks before last Christmas he took a lunchtime tour of a
half dozen of Manhattan's most exclusive jewelry and department
stores, talking to salespeople to assess the consumer mood.
   ``I said, `Tell me, how's business?' `Well, Mr. Grossman, we're
not supposed to talk about this. But this is the worst Christmas
we've had in seven years,''' he recalled them saying.
   For Grossman, that was a sure sign the recession in the area's
financial services industry would give the city and state a double
whammy, crimping income and sales tax revenues.
   To treasurers making decisions that affect millions of
taxpayers, that may seem a flippant way to forecast. But Grossman
trusts his methods, calling them ``informal but very reliable.''
   That's just the kind of confidence you'd expect in an umpire.

   Here are short profiles of some of the major
figures in Wall Street's financial scandals:
   _IVAN BOESKY, the former speculator in takeover stocks, was
accused of running a broad insider trading network. He settled
charges by paying $100 million and pleading guilty to one count of
lying to federal regulators. He was released from federal custody
April 4 after completing two years of a three-year prison term.
   _MICHAEL R. MILKEN, former head of junk-bond trading at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., pleaded guilty Tuesday to six counts of
violating federal securities and tax laws and agreed to pay $600
million. He faces up to 28 years in prison at sentencing Oct. 1.
Four of the six charges involved dealings with Boesky, but none
were for insider trading or racketeering. Milken had been charged
with 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in March 1989.
   _DENNIS LEVINE, a former managing director at Drexel, was
paroled last year after serving 17 months of a two-year prison term
for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. Levine's confessions
about a broad insider trading ring led prosecutors to Boesky.
Levine pleaded guilty to four felonies and returned $11.6 million
in alleged illegal profits.
   _MARTIN SIEGEL, pleaded guilty in 1987 to illegal stock trading
and tax evasion while head of mergers and acquisitions at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. He also agreed to return $9 million in cash and
securities to settle civil charges for his role in illegal dealings
with Boesky. Siegel, a former Drexel managing director, is awaiting
sentencing.
   _BOYD L. JEFFERIES, a Los Angeles stockbroker snared in the
Boesky web, was placed on probation and fined $250,000 after two
years of helping the government. He pleaded guilty to two felony
counts in 1987 and then testified in the trials of GAF Corp. and
corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.
   _BRUCE NEWBERG, a former Drexel trader, was indicted with Milken
and convicted with five others in the Princeton-Newport Partners
racketeering and fraud trial. He was sentenced to three months in
prison in the Princeton-Newport case. Newberg was Milken's
assistant at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., high-yield bond
division. His status in the Milken indictment is unresolved.
   _PAUL A. BILZERIAN, the Florida takeover strategist, last year
received four years in prison for his conviction on nine counts of
securities fraud, conspiracy and making false statements, and was
fined $1.5 million. The prison sentence for the former Singer Co.
chairman was the stiffest in the Wall Street scandals so far.
Bilzerian is is free pending appeal.
   _ROBERT FREEMAN, former head of arbitrage for Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., was arrested along with two other executives for insider
trading. Implicated by Siegel, Freeman pleaded guilty to one felony
count and this month was sentenced to four months in prison and
fined $1 million.

   The corporate parent of American
Airlines said Wednesday it will spend $11 billion to expand
passenger services and amenities in a bid to become the nation's
premiere international airline.
   AMR Corp. said it was embarking on the five-year plan that will
include such luxuries as lobster, chateaubriand and chocolate
mousse served on special china, and possibly even airborne fax
machines, despite a $19.3 million first-quarter loss reported last
week.
   ``We feel there is a place in the market for a premier United
States international airline, and our ambition is to be that _ to
become known as the U.S. flag carrier,'' said George Mueller, vice
president of customer services for AMR, based in Fort Worth.
   The program will include the previously announced $7.7 billion
investment in international aircraft, AMR said in simultaneous news
conferences in Arlington and Chicago, American's second-largest hub
after Dallas-Fort Worth. An estimated $655 million is earmarked for
terminal expansions, AMR said.
   The new amenities will include almost fully reclining seats,
private video screens in first class sections and more spacious
seating in business class. None of the changes will be included on
domestic flights, but Mueller said there will be no cuts in
domestic service to finance the amenities on international flights.
   The improvements will also include more up-scale menus, designed
by culinary experts such as Paul Prudhomme.
   AMR hopes the moves will let American become a recognized
international carrier and not just a mammoth domestic airline with
a handful of overseas flights.
   The airline has spent billions on planes ticketed for
international routes and hundreds of millions to acquire routes to
Latin America and London. It is aggressively seeking government
approval for new routes to Japan.
   AMR's announcement follows last week's report that it lost $19.3
million during the first three months of the year, compared with a
$156.7 million profit last year. The loss of 31 cents per share
came on a total operating revenue of $2.69 billion. In the same
period last year the company earned $1.60 per share on revenue of
$2.45 billion.
   Asked about AMR's large planned outlay coming after the reported
loss, Mueller said: ``If you are going to go after and capture a
market share in the international market, you're not going to do
that by cutting services.''
   Analysts expect most airlines to report losses or a smaller
profit than last year. AMR's loss was less than many industry
analysts had expected.

<HEAD>Precious Metal Futures Plunge; Platinum Leads Sell-Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices plunged Wednesday as a
supply-connected collapse of platinum prices triggered selling in
the gold and silver markets, which had already been weakened by a
lack of investor demand.
   Gold for spot delivery traded as low as $370 an ounce for the
first time since April 2 and silver plummeted to its lowest level
in nearly four years.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures surged to an
eight-month high; oil futures were sharply lower; grains and
soybeans retreated; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.20 to $5.70 lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at
$370.70 a troy ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 9.1 cents lower with
April at $4.919, the lowest settlement price for a near-month
silver contract on the exchange since May 19, 1986.
   Platinum futures finished $15.60 lower across the board on the
New York Mercantile Exchange with July at $472.20 a troy ounce, the
lowest near-month platinum settlement since April 2.
   The tumble extended Tuesday's steep losses in gold and silver,
which analysts had attributed mainly to weak investor demand in the
face of rising interest rates.
   Waves of selling swept easily through the thinly-traded platinum
market early in the session amid signs of physical platinum sales
by the Japanese and an announcement by the world's largest platinum
producer of plans to increase production beginning in 1991.
   Analysts agreed the expansion plans by South Africa's Rustenburg
Platinum Co. may have no effect on supplies of refined platinum for
several years. But because the company is such a large supplier,
its announcement ``really set us off,'' said James Steel, a metals
analyst with the futures brokerage Refco Inc.
   Some analysts also cited sluggish spring car sales, inferring a
corresponding drop in platinum demand for use in automobile
catalytic converters.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
discounted that notion, noting that car makers buy platinum on an
annual contract basis.
   ``I really think it was a technical sell-off and all these
things were excuses,'' she said.
   Some analysts pointed out, though, that supplies of silver
certified as deliverable on the Commodity Exchange _ reported
Wednesday at 254.5 million troy ounces _ are near record highs.
   The exchange reported supplies of deliverable copper at about
6,000 tons on Wednesday, one day before the April contract is due
to expire. Another exchange report indicated that more than 10,000
tons of copper would have been needed to satisfy all outstanding
April contracts as of Tuesday, the last day for which statistics
were available.
   The apparent shortfall in deliverable supplies was the main
factor behind Wednesday dramatic surge in copper futures prices,
analysts said.
   Copper settled 1.1 cents to 10 cents higher with the April
contract up 10 cents at $1.34 a pound, the highest settlement of a
near-month copper contract since Aug. 25.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures tumbled on the New York Merc amid
heavy selling motivated by technical market forces and speculation
that sluggish demand will not soak up much of the supply glut.
   A weekly report released Tuesday by the American Petroleum
Institute showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.2 million barrels
last week, adding to an already abundant inventory.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 34 cents
lower with June at $18.66 a barrel; heating oil was .25 cent to .60
cent lower with May at 52.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
1.2 cents to 1.79 cents lower with May at 62.60 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the Chicago Board
of Trade, led by a surging soybean market amid perceptions that the
Soviet Union may be preparing to buy more U.S. grain and soybean
meal.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 3\ cents higher with May at
$3.71 a bushel; corn futures were 2} cents to 4 cents higher with
May at $2.78} a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2{ cents higher with
May at $1.58} a bushel; soybeans were 10} cents to 13 cents higher
with May at $6.09\ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.02 cent to .22 cent lower with June at 72.85 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .08 cent to .42 cent higher with April at 84.27 cents a
pound; live hogs were unchanged to .70 cent higher with June at
62.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to .60 cent
lower with May at 63.95 cents a pound.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies
Wednesday in light trading as the Swiss franc and the West German
mark rose sharply, traders said.
   Gold prices slipped. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
for April delivery settled at $370.70 a troy ounce, $5.20 below
Tuesday's close. Later, Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
troy ounce of gold at $371.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $4.50 from
Tuesday's late bid.
   Traders said the Swiss franc was boosted by the Swiss central
bank's decision Tuesday to raise interest rates. That caused the
dollar to lose strength against the currency, said Lorenzo Troni,
vice president of foreign exchange at PaineWebber International Inc.
   The mark strengthened against the dollar on the belief that the
West German central bank will raise its official interest rate
shortly to help stem inflation, Troni said. Higher West German
interest rates make returns on the mark relatively more attractive
as an investment.
   Linda McLaughlin, a currency trader with Chemical Bank, said the
dollar lost value due to technical factors, with little economic
news to affect the currency. She described the trading as light.
   In late London trading, the dollar fetched 1.4665 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4865 late Tuesday. Later, in New York, the dollar
traded at 1.4575 Swiss francs, down from 1.4875 late Tuesday.
   In late London trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6820 marks,
down from 1.6930 marks late Tuesday. It stood at 1.6780 marks late
in New York, lower than Tuesday's late 1.6980 marks.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.10 yen to a closing 159.25
yen. In London, it was quoted late Wednesday at 158.59 yen. In New
York, the dollar finished at 158.73 yen, down from 158.95 yen late
Tuesday.
   The pound sank in London following the British announcement that
the merchandise trade deficit widened in March to 2.18 billion
pounds from February's 1.39 billion pounds. However, the currency
later finished stronger on buying by the Bank of England.
   Sterling finished the day in London at $1.6370 compared with
$1.6345 Tuesday. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.6405 from
$1.6347 on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late quotes, included: 5.6345 French francs, down from 5.6980;
1,231.00 Italian lire, down from 1,244.75; and 1.1608 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.15955.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe compared with late
Tuesday's levels included: 5.6455 French francs, down from 5.6795;
1.8970 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9100; 1,234.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,241.00; and 1.1603 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1590.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid of $371.25 a troy ounce,
down from $378.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the late bid was $371 an
ounce, down from $377.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.02 to close at a bid of
$375.95 per troy ounce.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell on New York's Comex to
$4.919, down from $4.994 Tuesday. Silver fell in London to a bid of
$4.97 a troy ounce from Tuesday's $5.10.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Slump Blamed for Poor Job Growth in Northeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Northeast's continued manufacturing slump
and a tight labor market are largely to blame for the region's
anemic job growth in the past two years, a labor report says.
   The region's poor showing in a state-by-state ranking of the
number of new jobs created _ seven Northeast states were in the
bottom 10 _ follows an economic boom in the early 1980s for the
Northeast, said a report by the New York regional Bureau of Labor
Statistics office.
   ``The 1980s were a glorious period for the Northeast, but then
they just ran out of steam,'' regional commissioner Samuel
Ehrenhalt said Wednesday. His report was released Tuesday in
Albany, N.Y.
   Before the last ranking, which covered a two-year period ending
in December 1987, only one of the seven states _ Pennsylvania _ had
previously been in the bottom 10 of new jobs created.
   The two Northeast states to fare better than the bottom 10 were
Maine, which was No. 9, and Vermont, which was listed as No. 31.
Maine had previously been listed as No. 10 for a ranking covering
1979-87 while Vermont was No. 8.
   Overall, the nine Northeastern states accounted for 9 percent of
the nation's new jobs from 1987-89, compared to the 21 percent
share from the early 1980s.
   The report said that over the past two years, the Northeast
continued on a 20-year path of having the poorest factory record
among the four regions.
   But it also said that expansion has slowed since December 1987,
especially in such major growth sectors as services, trade and
finance. Construction has also weakened considerably, the report
said.
   Ehrenhalt said a slowdown in the population growth in the
Northeast, and accompanying tight labor markets, also were to blame
for the region's slow job growth.
   ``If you're not growing that many more customers, you don't need
that many more retail stores,'' he said.
   In contrast to the Northeast's problems, seven of the top 10
states in job growth were in the West. Nevada, which experienced a
17.1 percent job growth, came in at No. 1, followed by Idaho and
then Washington.
   Nationally, job growth increased by 2.3 percent in 1989,
compared to the 3.2 percent in each of the previous two years.
   Here are the seven Northeast states in the bottom 10, followed
by job growth and then the previous ranking.
   _No. 41: New Jersey, 3.2 percent, No. 16.
   _No. 42, Pennsylvania, 2.9 percent, No. 41.
   _No. 45, New York, 1.9 percent, No. 27.
   _No. 47, Connecticut, 0.7 percent, No. 19.
   _No. 48, Rhode Island, 0.3 percent, No. 25.
   _No. 49, Massachusetts, 0.2 percent, No. 17.
   _No. 50, New Hampshire, -0.9 percent, No. 3.

   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Wednesday its
fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 30 percent from a year ago
because of higher unit sales volume and a lower effective tax rate.
   The company said it earned $404 million, or $1.14 a share, in
the three months ended March 31, up from $310 million, or 92 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 12.8 percent to $6.12 billion from $5.43 billion a

   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Procter &amp; Gamble
said it earned $1.32 billion, or $3.71 a share, up 27.3 percent
from $1.04 billion, or $3.06 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 11.9 percent to $17.87 billion from
$15.97 billion a year earlier.
   The company makes and markets laundry, cleaning and personal
care products, and food and beverage products.

   Carl Icahn said Wednesday that if USX Corp.
shareholders approve his proposal to spin off its steel business,
he would increase his USX stock holdings by $800 million and pledge
not to seek control of the company.
   Icahn, USX's largest stockholder with a 13.3 percent stake, was
apparently trying to counter suggestions that he has proposed the
spinoff solely as a way to drive up the price of USX stock and then
profit by selling his holdings.
   ``We have no intention of selling if the vote goes in favor of a
restructuring,'' Icahn said during a meeting with investors and
analysts here.
   ``If we win this vote, the company will do something'' that
should ultimately increase the value of USX's shares, said Icahn,
who is the chairman of Trans World Airlines and is a prominent
takeover strategist.
   Shareholders are to vote on Icahn's non-binding proposal at the
company's annual meeting May 7 in Findlay, Ohio, home of USX's
Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary.
   Under the plan, which USX management opposes, 80 percent of the
company's U.S. Steel division would be spun off as a separate
company with the proceeds of the sale distributed to USX
shareholders.
   Icahn, believing the company would be worth more to shareholders
broken up, said Wednesday he would buy USX stock at a price up to
$48 _ the amount he believes shareholders would receive if his plan
were carried out.
   He said he would sign a ``standstill'' agreement under which he
would not try to take over USX. ``We're not looking for control,''
he said.
   Asked what he would do if he loses the vote, Icahn said he did
not yet know. ``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' he
said.
   However, he said he was concerned about the future of USX if
shareholders spurn his proposal, saying the steel division needs an
equity infusion that it is unlikely to receive while linked to the
stronger Marathon unit.
   USX stock rose $1.25 to $34 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Wednesday.
   ``It seems to me that Icahn is simply trying to buy votes and
distract stockholders from the serious questions that we and a
number of prominent analysts have raised about his proposal to
break up USX,'' USX Chairman Charles Corry said in a prepared
statement.
   Icahn's offer to buy some additional shares could seriously
threaten the value of all outstanding USX shares, the chairman said.
   ``Icahn's announcement is totally conditional and subject to his
sole discretion,'' Corry said. ``It does not commit him to pay any
particular price and is subject to a standstill agreement with USX
that would have to be satisfactory to him.''
   ``Icahn could obviously refuse to buy any shares saying the
company was not willing to give him satisfactory terms for such a
standstill agreement.''
   Icahn said he believes a restructuring of USX would give
stockholders $9 a share for their U.S. Steel holdings, and $39 for
their Marathon holdings. However, he said Wednesday there were many
other steps besides his proposal that USX could take to restructure
and raise its stock price.
   He likened the situation at USX with that of Texaco Inc., which
restructured in 1989 after a series of battles with Icahn,
including a takeover bid and his unsuccessful attempt to unseat the
oil company's board.
   If his USX proposal garnered 51 percent of the vote, ``I think
the company will do something relatively dramatic,'' Icahn said.
``A number of people on the board are waiting for that kind of
message.''
   Skepticism over Icahn's motives follow a number of unsuccessful
bids in the past, including a 1987 run at USX. Many observers
believed he sought the Texaco restructuring _ which included the
sale of billions of dollars in assets _ for his own financial gain.

   Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday its
second-quarter profit rose 20 percent on a 26 percent sales
increase, and cited better results from its theme parks, filmed
entertainment and consumer products divisions.
   In the quarter ended March 31, Disney earned $178.5 million, or
$1.29 per share, on revenue of $1.3 billion, the company reported
Wednesday. That compared with $149 million, or $1.08 per share, on
revenue of $1.03 billion during the same quarter a year earlier.
   Both profits and sales figures were at record levels, the latest
in a string of record earnings for the entertainment conglomerate.
   Best-ever attendance at the theme parks, combined with higher
per capita guest spending and expanded resort operations, were
factors in increased revenues and operating income in the theme
parks segment, Disney said. The Disney-MGM Studios attraction in
Florida, which opened in May 1989, was a major draw, the company
said.
   Quarterly revenues in the division rose 22 percent to $710
million; operating income was up 14 percent to $194 million.
   Home video sales of ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``Turner and Hooch'' and the theatrical release of
``The Little Mermaid'' and ``Pretty Woman'' led the filmed
entertainment results higher, with growth in international
television and home video key factors, Disney said.
   Revenues in the division increased by 30 percent to $469
million, while operating income rose by 40 percent to $58 million.
   Increased merchandise licensing, the success of ``The Little
Mermaid'' sound track and European publishing activities
contributed to a 29 percent rise in revenues in the consumer
products division, to $125 million. Operating income rose 24
percent to $59 million.
   Disney said it also set records for earnings during a six-month
period.
   For the first six months of fiscal 1990, Disney said profits
rose 19 percent to $353 million, or $2.55 a share, from $297.3
million, or $2.16 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue climbed 25 percent to $2.59 billion in the latest six
months from $2.08 billion a year earlier.

   Production of the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac
Firebird will be moved to Canada from Southern California, clearing
the way for a new style of manufacturing at a General Motors Corp.
plant.
   GM of Canada Ltd. announced late Wednesday that the next
generation of the sports cars, called F-cars, would be produced at
its plant in Ste. Therese, Quebec, probably in late 1992. That will
open up GM's plant in Van Nuys, Calif., where the cars are made
currently, for a new carmaking strategy.
   There are about 3,500 employees at the Ste. Therese plant and
about 3,800 at Van Nuys.
   Sales of Camaros and Firebirds have been suffering this year,
like those of other GM cars. Through April 20, Camaro sales were
down 35 percent compared with last year, and Firebird sales were
off 39.6 percent.
   GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner said Wednesday in Detroit that there
was a proposal to make the Van Nuys plant GM's first ``flex plant''
once production of the current F-car is ended.
   ``It would be a facility capable of assembling a number of
various models that would allow us to respond more quickly to the
Western market,'' she said, declining to elaborate.
partment to combat
grasshoppers in the state of committee member Sen. Quentin Burdick,
D-N.D., and in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   In both its House and Senate versions, the bill was being
largely financed through cuts or transfers from the Pentagon's 1990
budget. The Senate bill claimed $2.8 billion in defense savings, $1
billion more than the House.
   The bill also includes a provision aimed at solving the
drawn-out fight between the Bush administration and Congress over
the Pentagon's ability to transfer funds to military personnel
accounts to avoid massive layoffs. Bush had failed last year to
exempt military personnel from the cuts imposed by a budget-cutting
law.
   The provision says $780 million of unspent funds from defense
programs, including the Strategic Defense Initiative, land-based
missiles and bomber programs, could be used to cover the shortfall
in the personnel accounts.
   When the Pentagon earlier this year asked Congress to let it
transfer money to cover personnel costs, House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Les Aspin objected and criticized the
administration for having put weapons before people.

   Union Carbide Corp. shareholders voted not
to increase a $470 million settlement to victims of the 1984 Bhopal
gas leak despite hearing stories of the victims' misery at
Wednesday's annual meeting.
   ``One man in the hospital is totally paralyzed on one side and
has great difficulty breathing,'' said the Rev. Andy Smith, a
director of the American Baptist Churches USA, who recently visited
Bhopal. ``I also saw great anger against the corporation there, and
many women and children raised their fists in anger.''
   Stockholders agreed with the company's directors and
overwhelmingly defeated Smith's proposal, as well as a resolution
to shut down a Union Carbide plant in South Africa.
   They were less sympathetic when it came to their pocketbooks,
grilling Chairman Robert D. Kennedy about Carbide's stock price,
dividends and plans to keep the company profitable during a
downturn in the chemical industry.
   ``We are as concerned as you are with the fact that our share
price has gone down in recent months,'' Kennedy told shareholders.
He acknowledged the stock has traded below $20 a share this week,
down from $24 a year ago and $33 in February 1989, after the Bhopal
settlement was reached.
   But he said he was optimistic the chemical and plastics maker
will do well through the downturn, saying its operations are the
most efficient in the industry.
   Union Carbide just reported a 53 percent drop in net earnings in
the first three months of the year. It attributed the decline to
weaker prices and overcapacity, as well as shutdowns at three
chemical plants during a winter cold spell.
   Union Carbide last year agreed to pay $470 million to compensate
for the deadly leak of methyl isocyanate gas from its plant in
Bhopal, India. About 3,600 people died in what was the world's
largest industrial accident.
   ``I walked through the streets and spoke to many victims. I was
in their homes,'' Smith said. ``What I found was appalling because
the people are still suffering.''
   He said one doctor told him at least 50,000 people had lung
damage. Many cannot work because of breathing problems.
   ``We believe that the $470 million is totally inadequate,'' he
told the meeting, urging stockholders to pay for long-term medical
care.
   Kennedy defended the settlement, saying fewer victims have come
forward than the government originally estimated. He also said
those who want more humanitarian aid should gripe to the Indian
government.
   ``Every single time that Union Carbide has attempted to act
unilaterally with any kind of humane response, ... we have been
rebuffed,'' he said. ``They don't want our help. They don't want us
meddling in caring for their people.''
   The new Indian government, which took power earlier this year,
has asked that the settlement agreed to by its predecessor be set
aside. It says much more compensation should be paid.
   At a press briefing later, Kennedy acknowledged it will take
time for the Bhopal disaster to fade.
   ``I think we will never put Bhopal behind us fully, but I also
believe you regain your image one day at a time, one year at a
time, by what you do and the record you achieve,'' he said.
   Kennedy encouraged one speaker to provide the company with
independent test results indicating soil and drinking water near
the Bhopal plant still contain toxic materials. Marco Kaltofen,
scientific director of the National Toxics Campaign in Boston, had
asked the company for a schedule for cleaning up the toxics.
   Kennedy also told stockholders Union Carbide was reducing
emissions and improving standards for handling toxic wastes and
materials at its facilities. He said the company has signed on to a
set of industry standards that aim to cut emissions, spills, leaks
and hazardous materials.

<HEAD>Setting of Sun Just the Latest Problem for Ingersoll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With AM-St. Louis Sun
^By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Ingersoll II hasn't been having a very
good spring.
   On Wednesday, the bold and gracious 43-year-old newspaper
publisher announced that his new, headline-grabbing project, the
St. Louis Sun, was folding after only seven months of publication.
   Five days earlier an effort to clear away much of his junk-bond
debt was unsuccessful when not a single bondholder signed up to
sell their bonds for cut-rate prices.
   Ingersoll, editor-in-chief of the Sun and chairman and chief
executive officer of Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll Publications
Co., stressed on Wednesday that the troubles are not related.
   ``I emphasize the sole reason the St. Louis Sun did not succeed
was the inability to generate adequate single-copy sales,''
Ingersoll said at Wednesday's unexpected news conference to
announce the end of the Sun.
   But even though his problems have intensified lately, Ingersoll,
the son of a respected newspaper editor, has remained cool and
upbeat.
   In an April 12 interview, while the Sun apparently was hitting a
low point, Ingersoll said the paper had plenty of good news as well
as some problems. ``The changes are all evolutionary, not
revolutionary,'' he said then.
   When he launched the Sun last September, he said he wanted to
prove that new newspapers, if properly designed and promoted, could
be introduced in the United States just as they had been in other
countries.
   He said he was planning to move to St. Louis and would
personally direct the rise of the Sun. He spent many late nights in
the newspaper's high-tech newsroom learning about sophisticated
equipment and refining ``the look'' of the Sun.
   ``I'm disappointed. I feel that we gave it our very best shot,''
Ingersoll said Wednesday.
   With the setting of the Sun, Ingersoll can turn his attention to
trying to negotiate a deal to buy back up to $158.6 million of the
$240 million of junk-bond debt at Community Newspapers Inc., an
Ingersoll Publications subsidiary.
   The company went on an expansion spree with proceeds from junk
bond issues. But the junk market has collapsed in recent months and
the bonds have been selling at about 40 cents on the dollar.
   That has put the company in a bind because it is required in
June to reset the terms on its $125 million of 13 percent bonds so
that the securities trade at 101 cents on the dollar. Judging by
current market conditions, that would require a staggering new
interest rate of more than 26 percent.
   Ingersoll offered to buy back up to 80 percent of the issue for
55 cents on the dollar. He also offered to pay 25 cents on the
dollar for 51 percent of the company's $114.9 million in 14 percent
bonds, which aren't due to be reset until next year.
   Ingersoll has extended his offer to buy the bonds until May 4
and on Wednesday he said he was considering upping his offer to
bondholders, but he wouldn't say how much.
   ``I don't do my negotiating in public,'' he said.

<HEAD>Genentech Reports First-Quarter Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genentech Inc. reported first
quarter profits rose to $13.3 million, or 15 cents a share, from
$7.4 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The biotechnology company said Wednesday the increase reflected
a pre-tax gain of about $11.9 million from the March sale of its 25
percent interest in Genencor, the industrial enzyme joint venture
Genentech helped found in 1982.
   Revenues for the first three months of the year rose 32 percent
to $120.2 million from $91.1 million.
   The company also reported expenses of $11.7 million in the
quarter related to its proposed merger with Roche Holdings Inc.,
the Swiss drug company.
   Merger expenses are expected to total about $150 million when
the transaction is completed, leaving the company with a loss for
the year, Genentech said in a statement.
   ``It was a real strong revenue quarter,'' said John Girton, an
analyst with Von Kasper &amp; Company. ``There was good product
showing.''
   Sales of the company's human growth hormone, Protopin, increased
to $35 million from $24.9 million a year earlier.
   Activase, Genentech's heart attack drug, maintained about a
two-thirds market share during the quarter. Sales of the drug were
$54.9 million, up from $48.1 million for the first quarter of 1989
but down from the $56.7 million for the fourth quarter of 1989.
   ``Genentech now has five potential new products in human
clinical trials and we believe one of the most promising pipelines
in the industry,'' said G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive
officer. ``The pending investment by Roche should give us the
additional resources and financial stability to maximize the
potential of this pipeline.''

<HEAD>Low Gas Prices Force Mesa To Cut Further Cuts Distribution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Limited Partnership, the energy company
headed by T. Boone Pickens, said it lost $18.24 million in the
first quarter and would suspend cash distributions to preferred
unitholders until natural gas prices increase.
   The decision, which takes affect after the first quarter
payment, comes four months after Mesa stopped paying common
unitholders because of low natural gas prices. Distributions to
unitholders in a partnership are akin to dividends paid to
stockholders of a corporation.
   ``The warmest winter in 30 years provided no opportunity for
significant improvement in prices this past winter,'' Pickens said
in explaining the decision.
   ``We expect prices this summer to be about equal with those
received in 1989,'' he said. ``The partnership will continue to
report losses until gas prices increase.''
   Pickens said the average natural gas price during the first
quarter was $1.90 per million British thermal units. On Wednesday,
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange ended with gas for June
delivery at $1.552 per million BTUs, down from Tuesday's $1.555.
   Mesa said it lost $18.24 million, or 30 cents per common unit,
in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $14.61
million, or 15 cents per unit, a year earlier. Revenues slumped to
$96.5 million from $105 million.
   Mesa last year reduced its quarterly payout to both common and
preferred unitholders to 37.5 cents a unit from 50 cents. Mesa met
the payments with proceeds from stock investments and not its
energy operations, but even those earnings have slumped.
   Earnings from marketable securities plummetted to $3.75 million
in the latest quarter from $41.9 million in the first quarter of
1989.

<HEAD>Pratt &amp; Whitney Receives $240 Million Thai Engine Order</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Thai Airways International has placed a $300 million order for
General Electric Co. engines to power five Boeing 747-400 jetliners
and four Airbus Industrie A330 jetliners, GE said.
   The order consists of 28 installed and six spare CF6-80C2 and
-80E1 engines made by GE's Aircraft Engine Division, based in the
Cincinnati suburb of Evendale.
   Thai is scheduled to take delivery of the Boeing aircraft in
late 1991, while the A330s are scheduled for delivery in 1993, GE
said Wednesday.
   In East Hartford, Conn., meanwhile, Pratt &amp; Whitney said Thai
Airways and the Royal Thai Air Force had placed an engine order
worth up to $240 million.
   Thai Airways has placed a firm order for four A330s, each to be
powered by two PW4000 engines. It also placed options on engines
for four additional aircraft.
   The firm order is worth about $78 million and the option could
be worth an additional $80 million if exercised, Pratt &amp; Whitney
said.
   The airline also placed firm orders for 10 PW4000 engines plus
spares worth about $70 million to power five A300 jets.
   The Royal Thai Air Force placed a $12 million order for two
PW4000s to power its new Airbus A310 to be delivered in 1991, Pratt
&amp; Whitney said.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney is a division of Hartford-based United
Technologies Corp.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Reach Agreement on Wood Product Sales</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to include summary of agreement. Also on
general wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Japan reached agreement
Wednesday to expand sales of American wood products as the Bush
administration hinted that Japan's actions will keep it off a ``hit
list'' of countries with the most offensive trade barriers.
   The agreement wrapped up the final outstanding case cited by the
Bush administration a year ago when it targeted Tokyo for priority
market-opening negotiations.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, announcing the successful
conclusion of the talks, said the agreement, which lowers tariffs
and revises Japanese building code standards, should result in a $1
billion increase in American export sales while providing
``lower-cost and higher-quality wood housing to Japanese
consumers.''
   The administration a year ago targeted Japan for its barriers to
sales of American wood products, satellites and supercomputers.
   All three issues have been settled in the last five weeks after
months of talks with little progress.
   The government of Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has
pushed to lower trade tensions between the two economic superpowers
since President Bush and Kaifu held a recent trade summit in
California.
   The Bush administration faces a Monday deadline for deciding
whether to target Japan in a second round of market-opening
negotiations under a tough section of the 1988 trade law known as
Super 301.
   Various American industry groups and members of Congress argue
that the administration must cite Japan again to keep pressure on a
country that accounts for nearly half of America's overall trade
deficit.
   But Hills, while saying the administration has not made its
final decision, strongly indicated that she opposed targeting Japan
again.
   She said that in a review of 33 Japanese trade barriers, she
could find none that could best be resolved through use of the
Super 301 process. That provision provides for retaliatory
sanctions if the barriers aren't removed within a specified period
of time.
   She told the committee that the flurry of concessions made by
Japan in the past month indicated that Kaifu's government seriously
intended to resolve trade frictions.
   However, various senators said Tokyo's record in honoring past
agreements was weak and that there was no evidence the latest round
of commitments would make a dent in America's $49 billion deficit
with Japan.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
the administration would be making a serious mistake if it failed
to target Japan under Super 301, which he called the cornerstone of
the 1988 trade law.
   He and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., both held out the threat that
Congress would block approval of pending trade agreements with
Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union and China if the
administration failed to target Japan.
   ``If the administration ignores a trade law that Congress has
constitutionally enacted, I am concerned it may poison the well for
the consideration of those agreements,'' Bentsen told Hills.
   However, Hills asked the committee to give her more leeway in
choosing the best way to gain market access with Japan.
   `I need a little of your confidence and just a little longer
tether,'' she said.
   Bush and the economic policy group of his Cabinet were scheduled
to hear Thursday from Hills on the Super 301 designation, with
indications that an announcement on the issue could come late
Thursday or Friday.
   Last year, the administration cited Japan, Brazil and India for
the priority negotiations. Hills said that the discussions with
Japan and Brazil had been successful, but that no progress had been
made in talks with India concerning foreign investment and
insurance.
   Some in the administration have argued that no country should be
cited this year, but Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said such a decision
would send a ``dangerous and inaccurate'' message that America is
not concerned about unfair barriers.
   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., warned Hills that he would push for
legislation to extend the requirement for the administration to
target countries, which was due to expire this year.
   ``If a foreign country thinks they can slide by this year with
talk and talk, we are going to come back and tighten up'' the law,
Riegle said.
   However, Sens. Bob Packwood, R-Oregon, and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., both said that they feared that targeting Japan
after it had met U.S. demands would be wrong.

   Share prices declined slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Wednesday morning while the dollar moved higher against
the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 42.15 points, or 0.14
percent, ending the morning session at 29,459.23.
   The index, which shed 177.69 points Tuesday, regained more than
200 points in the first hour of morning trading before falling back.
   The dollar was changing hands at 158.98 yen at late morning, up
from Tuesday's close of 158.15 yen. It opened at 158.96 yen and
ranged between 158.80 yen and 159.15 yen during morning trading.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's setback to declines in stock
index futures prices that discouraged market players.
   Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co., said many investors were reluctant to buy issues
ahead of the ``Golden Week'' holidays that start Saturday and go
through May 6 for many Japanese companies.
   ``They are trying to stay on the safer side especially due to
uncertainties over foreign exchange fluctuations,'' he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's strength followed its
overnight upswing in New York, dealers said.
   The dollar gained ground as market players bought the West
German mark against the yen, which indirectly helped weaken the yen
against the dollar, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst
with New Japan Securities Co. Buying and selling was evenly matched
when the dollar crossed the 159-yen level, he added.
   ``Trading was thin ahead of the Golden Week holidays,'' Kanai
said.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said
holidays that shut markets in Australia and New Zealand Wednesday
kept trading very light.
