   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee on Tuesday unanimously recommended approval of interferon
alpha as the first treatment shown to be effective against
hepatitis C, an FDA spokeswoman said.
   Interferon alpha, a substance produced naturally in the body
that can be made in large quantitities by genetic engineering, has
already been approved for treatment of hairy-cell leukemia,
Kaposi's sarcoma and genital warts.
   The drug does not cure hepatitis C, also known as non-A, non-B
hepatitis and is not universally effective, but studies have shown
that it can alleviate some effects of the disease, said FDA
spokeswoman Faye Peterson.
   Committee members also recommended long-term followup of
hepatitis patients after the drug receives formal approval.
   Hepatitis C is a chronic disease that sometimes leads to
cirrhosis and cancer of the liver, which often are fatal. As many
as 200,000 people get hepatitis C each year in the United States,
at least half from unknown causes.
   Known causes include blood transfusions from infected people,
sharing of infected intravenous needles by drug abusers and,
according to some studies, sexual relations.
   The drug is manufactured by Schering-Plough Corp. under the
brand name Intron A.
   The advisory panel also recommended against FDA approval of
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, or GM-CSF, one of
a new family of complex proteins that regulate production of blood
cells. GM-CSF is critical in the production of white blood cells.
   Committee members agreed that more research on the drug is
needed before it can be approved for use in cancer therapy and
other diseases that have impaired the body's ability to fight
infections, Peterson said.
   The drug, also genetically engineered, is being tested on
patients whose bone-marrow transplants failed. The panel
recommended the FDA allow continued use of the drug for patients
with this life-threatening condition.
   The drug is made by Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceutical Inc.
   The body produces GM-CSF naturally, but in very small
quantities. Its gene was identified recently and the drug now can
be produced through genetic engineering, the company said.

   The Senate defeated Republican attempts
Tuesday to diminish labor's clout at the polls _ usually on behalf
of Democrats _ as part of a bill to clean up the way federal
election campaigns are financed.
   On largely party-line votes, Democrats defeated amendments to
strip unions of their tax-exempt status if they stay in politics
and to allow their members to demand refunds of any dues spent on
elections or lobbying.
   Republicans claimed the votes demonstrate their contention that
Democrats' campaign finance reform bill and its spending ceilings
is a ``partisan charade'' that will assure a veto by President Bush.
   ``We might as well as go on to something else,'' said Senate GOP
leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``So far this campaign reform bill only reforms Republicans,''
Dole said. ``We like reform, but ... it's got to be reform that
applies to both sides.''
   Meanwhile, 16 Democrats joined Republicans in defeating an
effort by liberals to have the government pick up 70 percent of a
candidate's general election costs through a new $2 checkoff on
individual income tax returns.
   Democrats had stripped the provision from their bill last Friday
but Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., tried to put it bank in Tuesday
night. His amendment was defeated 68-30.
   Also defeated on a 49-49 tie vote was an amendment by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., that would have prevented candidates from rolling
over any surpluses in their campaign accounts for use by their
House and Senate offices or for future campaigns. Instead, McCain's
measure would have required that any surpluses be turned over to
the government.
   Democrats did go along with one Republican amendment, by Sen.
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, to prohibit senators and House members
from using their free postage privileges for mass mailings during
the calendar years they are up for re-election.
   Nickles cited figures showing that uses of the congressional
mail frank nearly double in election years. For example, they went
from $53 million in 1981 to $100 million in 1982, from $72 million
in 1983 to $110 million in 1984 and from $63 million in 1987 to
$113 million in 1988.
   Also approved was an amendment by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
that would prohibit companies more than 50 percent foreign owned
from forming political action committees to raise funds for
candidates.
   Bentsen, whose amendment was adopted by a 73-27 vote, said PACs
of foreign-owned companies contributed $2.8 million to candidates
in the 1988 election _ a 19 percent increase over 1986 and 5
percent of the total given by all corporate PACs.
   ``It creates inevitable pressures on (U.S.) employees to use
their PAC muscle in ways acceptable to the corporate masters in
London or Frankfurt or Tokyo,'' he said. ``American campaigns
should be for Americans.''
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Bentsen's proposal was moot
since Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have now agreed to
ban PAC contributions altogether in the bill.
   Nonetheless, he voted against it, saying the amendment would
strip some 3,000 U.S. citizens who work at a Toyota assembly plant
in his state of their political rights should the courts rule that
a total ban on PACs is unconstitutional.
   ``It does not treat all of us citizens the same way,'' McConnell
said. ``If you happen to work at Toyota in Kentucky you don't get
the same rights as somebody who works at Ford.''
   On a 58-41 vote, the Senate defeated a McConnell amendment to
lift the tax-exempt status of unions and other organizations if
they participate at all in election campaigns.
   Rejected earlier on a 59-41 vote was a Republican amendment that
would have allowed the nation's 17 million union members to demand
refunds of any dues not spent directly on collective bargaining or
grievances.
   Republicans contended unions spend tens of millions of dollars
of the estimated $3.3 billion to $5 billion in dues they collect
each year to indirectly benefit their favorite politicians through
voter registration, voter education and turnout programs.
   The National Right to Work Committee, a group that wants to
outlaw agency shop contracts under which non-union workers must pay
fees to unions, estimates that organized labor spends $330 million
on politics in every two-year election cycle.
   ``If you don't do anything about this sewer money from unions, I
don't think you have campaign reform,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. ``Ninety percent goes to Democrats even though 30 percent
to 40 percent of union members are Republicans.''
   President Bush announced a year ago that, as a part of any
campaign finance reform measure, he wanted Congress to expand on a
Supreme Court ruling to give workers a right to seek refunds of any
union dues spent on politics.
   The court ruled in 1988 that a non-union technician who paid
fees to the Communications Workers of America as part of an agency
shop contract with AT&amp;T was entitled to a refund of the portion not
spent directly on collective bargaining.

   A grand jury declined Tuesday to indict a
white police officer in the shooting of a black teen-ager whose
death this year sparked rioting in the New York City suburb of
Teaneck.
   After announcing the grand jury's decision, state Attorney
General Robert Del Tufo said he would empanel a new grand jury
because of errors he said were made in the autopsy.
   The grand jury investigated the death of Phillip Pannell, 16, of
River Edge, who was shot in the back by Teaneck Police Officer Gary
Spath, 29, on April 10. Pannel's death sparked a night of racially
motivated rioting in Teaneck, a New York City suburb.
   The shooting prompted mobs of angry youths to rampage in an area
near the police headquarters in Teaneck, overturning cars and
attacking journalists. Black community activists organized marches
and the killing polarized a community that had prided itself on
racial harmony.
   The dead boy's father, Phillip Pannell Sr. appealed for calm. He
gave reporters what he called a message for the city's young people:
   ``I'm willing to give America another chance for justice,'' he
said. ``I feel justice will be served. Chill out.''
   After announcement Tuesday, lawyers from the NAACP and community
leaders met Teaneck youths in the parking lot behind the police
station, trying to calm them.
   Ted Wells, a lawyer for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, told the teens that calling a second
grand jury was ``an extraordinary step.''
   ``If there was a scam they'd give no indictment, shut up and
bite the bullet,'' Wells explained.
   Spath met with reporters at his attorneys office and said: ``I'd
like to thank the Lord, Jesus Christ, for carrying me on his
shoulders. We've been praying for the Pannell family all along and
will continue to pray for the Pannell family.''
   The attorney general said the decision that a new grand jury
probe is warranted is ``fortified by the fact that the grand jury
which heard the case was seriously divided.''
   The attorney general maintained that errors in the autopsy by
the Bergen County medical examiner ``led to an incorrect conclusion
concerning the possible actions of Mr. Pannell at the time he was
shot.''
   A key question before the grand jury was whether Pannell had
raised his hands in the air and pleaded with police not to shoot,
as some witnesses said, or whether he twice stopped and turned in a
threatening way toward the officers.
   ``The mistake permeated and distorted the investigation and the
grand jury presentation. The medical examiner has admitted his
error,'' Del Tufo said.
   Del Tufo said the decision that a new grand jury probe is
warranted is ``fortified by the fact that the grand jury which
heard the case was seriously divided.''
   Spath's attorney, Robert Galantucci, accused Del Tufo and Gov.
Jim Florio of calling for another grand jury to curry favor with
voters.
   ``It sends a bad message to police officers throughout this
state. It sends a bad message to them, but they can't change the
truth,'' Galantucci said. ``They shouldn't be playing politics with
the grand jury system.''
   The 21-member grand jury was to determine if Spath was justified
in firing his .38-caliber service revolver, or whether he should be
indicted on charges of manslaughter or improperly using deadly
force.
   The grand jurors have been meeting once or twice a week since
late April. They reached a decision late Tuesday afternoon and
Attorney General Robert Del Tufo scheduled a news conference to
release the panel's findings.
   The shooting took place when Spath responded to a telephone
report of a youth with a gun.
   The grand jurors heard accounts from more than two dozen
witnesses, including police, bystanders, and Pannell's friends.
   Among those testifying before the panel was Officer Wayne
Blanco, who frisked Pannell moments before he was shot by Spath,
according to The Record of Hackensack. Blanco testified that he
warned Spath that he felt a gun in Pannell's jacket, according to
the newspaper.
   But teen-agers with Pannell said there was no frisking before
the youngster ran. The man whose telephone call alerted police
about a youth with a gun backed the youths' accounts when he
testified before the grand jury, the newspaper said.
   Because of the sensitivity of the case, it was transferred from
Bergen County to a state grand jury sitting in Trenton, and it was
handled by a deputy attorney general.
   Spath was suspended with pay.

<HEAD>Challenger Rebuffed in Plan for Shooting Match with Congressman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Paul Jurgens wanted to match
his pistol-shooting skills against the man he wants to unseat,
Democratic Rep. Richard Durbin. But Durbin shot down the idea.
   Durbin turned down the invitation Monday, citing the press of
congressional business in the week before the August recess, and he
took a pot shot at Jurgens.
   ``Mr. Jurgens shot himself in the foot when he issued this
challenge without even checking the congressional schedule,'' he
said.
   Jurgens, who also mounted an unsuccessful bid against Durbin in
1988, had challenged the four-term congressman Monday to a shooting
match to be held Wednesday during a national tournament in the
community of Barry.
   Jurgens, an oral surgeon from Decatur, said he proposed the
match not to ``see who gets the most bull's-eyes'' but to draw
attention to his differences with Durbin on gun control.
   Both candidates generally support private ownership of guns. But
Durbin has voted for some restrictions on the sale of handguns.
Jurgens opposes such measures.
   Jurgens faces an uphill battle against Durbin. In 1988, Durbin
carried nearly 69 percent of the west-central Illinois district.
   Jurgens, however, might have an edge with a gun.
   He said he hunts with a rifle several times annually and goes
target-shooting with a pistol two or three times a year.
   Durbin said he has gone hunting but doesn't do so regularly.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Fossil of Ancient Lizard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first known remains of a giant lizard that
may have dined on baby dinosaurs have been found in Mongolia, a
researcher says.
   The 80-million-year-old skull and forelimb were a highlight of
the first expedition to that country by Western paleontologists in
65 years, said Michael Novacek.
   The lizard, which apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon,
was perhaps 8 feet long and may have been a juvenile, Novacek said.
It may have eaten young dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs, he said.
   Its fossil remains were found in the Gobi Desert, near a
dinosaur nesting site that contained eight eggs, he said.
   The Komodo dragon is the largest living lizard, reaching a
length of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles. Novacek
said the animal has been known to attack and consume adult humans.
   Novacek is vice president and dean of science at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York. He and museum colleagues
Malcolm McKenna and Mark Norell recently undertook the month-long
expedition at the invitation of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences.
   The American researchers and Mongolian counterparts also found
100-million-year-old remains of shrew-sized mammals, which may shed
light on the spread of the ancestors of modern mammals, he said.
   They also found two unusually well-preserved skeletons of
protoceratops, a beaked dinosaur that grew 4 to 5 feet long, and
one of an armored dinosaur called an ankylosaur, which grew 15 to
20 feet long, Novacek said. The fossils were about 80 million years
old.
   The wealth of discoveries from the relatively brief expedition
gives hope that further work will turn up much more material, he
said. The museum and the Mongolian academy signed an agreement for
three more expeditions over the next three years, he said.
   Mongolia contains ``a tremendous potential for exploration that
you don't see in North America,'' with areas the size of Wyoming
that have not been explored, he said.

   For Soviet authorities, the geophysical crises are bad enough.
But, in a land of limited freedom, ecology is also a central
rallying point for politics.
   Regional leaders blame Moscow for their condition, and growing
new popular movements demand action on a long agenda of problems:
nuclear contamination from atomic testing in Kazakhstan, for
example, and poor living conditions and child labor among cotton
pickers in Uzbekistan.
   Their point is always the same: Outsiders' decisions devastate
local lands and peoples.
   In a region that produces 90 percent of the Soviet Union's
cotton, the word ``ecology'' symbolizes the challenge of preventing
a monoculture from sucking their land dry.
   At the Madaniyat farm here, huge red letters atop the
headquarters building declare: ``We want communism.'' Inside,
director Mohammed Akhmadov says he is flexible.
   ``We feel the pinch, and we're adjusting,'' Akhmadov said,
fingering a tattered paper listing water flow rates. In a decade,
cotton production has dropped 10 percent. New land is planted in
fruit trees and vegetables needing less irrigation.
   He said farmers use fewer and safer chemicals, and he expected
once-serious health problems to stop. New freedoms allowed farm
managers to be more commercially and ecologically effective.
   ``Words are not important,'' he said. ``What matters is
production and making people's lives as good as possible. Who cares
what system?''
   Many people are far less optimistic. The day that Akhmadov
spoke, a local newspaper reported that Uzbek collectives used 50
percent more chemicals than was safe.
   ``They only say they are changing,'' said Kovaleyev. ``There are
quotas, plans to meet, and farmers stick to old ways. If we don't
stop these addictions, much of Central Asia will be as dead as the
Aral Sea.''
   If some Soviet authorities insist the sea will be saved,
old-timers seem to side with the pessimists.
   ``The fresh air, the fat fish, we will never see that again,'' a
desperate old captain said into Yatsenia's camera. ``Now, we can
only scratch by, with no place to go and nothing to do.'' Then he
lapsed into a mournful Uzbek song of his beautiful, dying Aral.

<HEAD>Actress Jill Esmond, First Wife Of Laurence Olivier, Is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jill Esmond, the film and stage actress and first
of the late actor Laurence Olivier's three wives, has died at age
82, her family says.
   Ms. Esmond, who appeared in such Hollywood films as ``The White
Cliffs of Dover'' and ``Random Harvest,'' died Saturday at her home
at Wimbledon in southwest London. No cause of death was given.
   Ms. Esmond was the daughter of the actor-manager and dramatist
Henry Vernon Esmond and his actress wife Eva Moore.
   She studied at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and made
her London stage debut in December 1922, playing the role of Nibs
in ``Peter Pan.''
   In 1925, she played Sorel Bliss in Noel Coward's comedy ``Hay
Fever.''
   She met Olivier in June 1928 when she was playing in John
Drinkwater's ``Bird in Hand'' and he joined the cast.
   They went to the United States, where they both made their
Broadway debut in 1929, she in `Bird in Hand'' and Olivier in
``Murder on the Second Floor.''
   After returning to London, she made her movie debut in the 1930
version of ``The Chinese Bungalow'' with the young Anna Neagle.
   She married Olivier on July 25, 1930, and the following January
they appeared together on Broadway with Coward and Gertrude
Lawrence in Coward's ``Private Lives.''
   In 1932, Ms. Esmond appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's movie ``The
Skin Game'' and went on to appear many times on screen. At this
stage in her career, she was a far bigger star than Olivier.
   Many audiences felt that with her strong, proud features and
dark, heavy eyes she was best suited to stern roles rather than
comedy.
   At the end of 1935, she became pregnant. But on the very night
she and Olivier were celebrating this, he met actress Vivien Leigh,
who was later to become his second wife.
   In 1937, Ms. Esmond played Olivia to Olivier's Sir Toby Belch in
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' at London's Old Vic theater. But by
then their marriage had broken down under the strain of her
husband's infatuation with Ms. Leigh and they were divorced in 1940.
   Olivier married Ms. Leigh the following year. That marriage
ended in divorce in 1961. Olivier, whose third wife was actress
Joan Plowright, died on July 11 last year at age 82.
   He became Lord Olivier when he was made a peer in 1970.
   In 1942, Ms. Esmond returned to Broadway in ``The Morning Star''
and appeared in a series of Hollywood films. In 1946, she returned
to Britain, where she resumed her movie career.
   She made her last London stage appearance in ``Party Manners''
in 1950, and her movie career ended in 1955.
   The son of Ms. Esmond and Olivier, Tarquin, was born in 1936.
Ms. Esmond never remarried.

   Six volunteers who died while fighting a forest
fire last month inexplicably ran uphill toward the fire while
others escaped by running down the hill, investigators found.
   ``I think they panicked,'' said a recent report by Gila County
Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Alexander, who investigated the June 26 deaths.
``They should have gone downhill.''
   The six victims were part of a volunteer firefighting crew from
the Arizona State Prison at Perryville. Five inmates and a
supervisor were caught in the fire when it went out of control
during a windstorm.
   The fire, which started from a lightning strike in the Dude
Creek area northeast of Payson, burned 28,500 acres of forest land,
along with dozens of cabins and summer homes and the historic Zane
Grey's cabin.
   The fire was on National Forest Land about 70 miles northeast of
Phoenix.

<HEAD>Intellectuals Say Romanians Must Accept True Risks of Democracy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Plesu, philosopher and art
historian, was a dissident outcast under the old regime. Now he is
culture minister, with a spacious office and the freedom to talk
about democracy and revolution.
   Since Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed and
executed in December, intellectuals like Plesu have become the
conscience of Romania, wooed by political parties and foreign
governments.
   They are divided on whether to support President Ion Iliescu's
government, but united in believing there will be no return to
communism in this nation of 23 million, which suffered the most
violence in the breakup of the Soviet bloc.
   ``Tomorrow, if the government says all private institutions will
be abolished, there would be a second revolution,'' Plesu said in
an interview. ``That's what makes me optimistic about the future
despite all the problems, all the difficulties that we are going to
face.''
   Many intellectuals worry about a government that, although
freely elected, has resorted to some of its disgraced predecessor's
tactics. Although the Communist Party is dead, its structure
remains, they say.
   In June, Iliescu called loyal miners to Bucharest to stop
anti-government demonstrations. They beat protesters, hunted
intellectuals and ransacked the offices of critical publications in
the worst violence since the revolution.
   Nonetheless, Plesu and others are convinced things have changed
as the government takes its first steps toward a market economy.
They see a difficult road to real democracy, however.
   Intellectuals were leaders in the struggle against Ceausescu. It
was poet Mircea Dinescu, now chairman of the influential Writers
Union, who announced Ceausescu's ouster on the state radio.
   Then came the landslide election victory May 20 of Iliescu, a
former alternate member of the Communist Party Politburo, and the
National Salvation Front, a loose grouping of workers, peasants,
intellectuals and technocrats that took power during the revolution.
   Many Romanians think the Front is controlled by Communists.
   Intellectuals who feel Iliescu's triumph bodes ill for freedom
blame other intellectuals who did not speak out strongly for
democracy after the revolution.
   It was Romania's first free election in 44 years and writer
Stelian Tanase now wishes the Group for Social Dialogue, an
organization of dissident intellectuals, had gone on television for
a few minutes each week to explain the basics of democracy and
multiparty politics.
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``It's too late to have regrets.''
Tanase edits an anti-Communist weekly called 22, which the miners
tried to shut.
   The political campaign was marred by allegations of fraud and
intimidation that forced many of the more than 50 parties to
curtail electioneering.
   Iliescu's victory was not questioned, but foreign observers said
his 85 percent landslide showed pluralistic democracy had not taken
root.
   Plesu, Tanase and Dinescu belong to the Group for Social
Dialogue, which was formed after the revolution and generally
opposes the National Salvation Front.
   Two months ago, the Tomorrow Society was established to support
the Front. Its prominent members include literary critic Eugen
Simion and authors Marin Sorescu and Augustin Bazura.
   Romulus Vulpescu, a writer and theater director elected as an
independent legislator on the Front list, said, ``I believe the
Front is sincere and that it will truly seek to recreate the 1923
constitution, which was one of the most liberal in the world.''
   Alexandra Cornelescu, head of the English department at
Bucharest University, is a staunch Front supporter but concedes
violence ``harms intellectuals' faith in the government.''
   Tanase said: ``It's a long way to democracy and to a free
Romania. It's very difficult, after a half century, to change in so
short a time people's mentality. The people voted for continuity.
They were under stress, frightened by possible changes.
   ``Democracy. That means risk, liberty, the possibility to lose
or to win. The people don't want to take this chance. ... They're
all frightened to lose their jobs.''
   In Plesu's view, communism has spawned a bureaucracy and
mentality ``that likes privilege or power, and which has no
knowledge of Marxist thinking.''
   He said the bureaucrats ``are opportunists,'' and change will
take years ``because there are millions of them.''
   A press that consists of 1,200 publications, most of them
anti-government, doesn't help foster democracy because ``they are
incredibly primitive, attacking without a point of view,'' Plesu
said. ``They transform the liberty to say truth into the liberty to
say anything.''
   Thomas Kleininger, a mathematician who is vice president of the
Group for Social Dialogue, said Romania has no history of united
opposition.
   ``We are beginning from zero,'' he said. ``We have no tradition
in fighting against communism.''
   Romania had no counterpart to dissident playwright Vaclav Havel,
now president of Czechoslovakia, or magazine editor Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, who became Poland's prime minister. In part, that is
because Ceausescu cleverly manipulated the intellectuals, dividing
them and silencing critical voices.
   Intellectuals always were divided and isolated from much of
society. Most sided with the monarchy or fascist leaders before
World War II, and with the Communist dictators afterward, reaping
material rewards denied those who resisted.
   Plesu and others suffered internal exile and house arrest. The
more careful kept their heads down at non-controversial jobs,
deploring the situation in private but keeping silent in public.
   The revolution transformed the intellectual hierarchy.
Overnight, dissidents became heroes and Ceausescu supporters became
the outcasts.
   Most dissidents initially supported the Front. Plesu became
culture minister in the interim government and writer Dan Petrescu
his deputy, but Dinescu and poet Ana Blandiana refused government
posts.
   Blandiana and Doina Cornea, a former professor of French who was
Romania's best-known dissident, left the Front in late January,
accusing it of perpetuating totalitarian practices and breaking a
promise to stay out of the elections.
   Kleininger, the mathematician, predicted the greatest conflict
in the next two years would be between reformers and the
bureaucracy.
   He said the Communist infrastructure will die only if the new
government renounces its monopoly on power and promotes a real
multiparty system and private enterprise.
   ``The important thing for us is to bring to the consciousness of
men that freedom and initiative under harder conditions are more
important than this feeling of security,'' Kleininger said.
   ``Like lions in the zoo, we never knew what it meant to be
free.''

<HEAD>Searchers Find Debris Near Where United Jet Split Open</HEAD>

   Navy searchers on Monday found debris on the
ocean floor near where a cargo door tore off a United Airlines jet
last year, killing nine people, authorities said.
   Searchers have yet to confirm the debris is from United Airlines
Flight 811, said Lt. Col. Bob Anderson, a Navy spokesman.
   One object, wedged in the ocean floor, is believed to be a large
piece of metal, which could be the 10-by-10-foot cargo door,
Anderson said.
   The 224-foot Navy tug USS Narrangansett, using a small,
remote-controlled submarine to search the ocean floor three miles
down, recorded the location of the find 90 miles south-southeast.
The tug was to return to Honolulu on Tuesday, Anderson said.
   The Orion submarine's sonar located the debris, but searchers
were unable to obtain a picture of the find with the sub's video
camera, Anderson said.
   The Navy will report the find to the National Transportation
Safety Board, which will decide whether to try to recover the
debris, Anderson said.
   The Boeing 747 carried 355 passengers when it left Honolulu
International Airport for New Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.
   Shortly after takeoff, a cargo door opened at 22,000 feet,
tearing away a section of fuselage. Nine people were swept to their
deaths and five others suffered serious injuries. The crew managed
to return and land in Honolulu.
   The NTSB's inquiry determined that a faulty design of the door's
locking mechanism probably caused a cockpit panel light to falsely
indicate the door was locked.
   The NTSB blamed United, Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to correct problems with the door.
   The National Transportation safety Board has completed its
inquiry into the accident, but has requested the search for the
door with hopes its inspection will lead to better plane safety.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and the chief negotiator for his Moslem extremist captors
said Monday that they had reached agreement to end a 4-day-old
hostage siege.
   Robinson, other Cabinet ministers and lawmakers were among 41
hostages reported held by the black Moslems, who stormed the
Parliament building and the government television station on Friday
in a coup attempt. Robinson suffered gunshot wounds in both feet.
   Word of the accord came in telephone call to Trinidad journalist
Tony Fraser from inside Parliament and was not immediately
announced to the nation.
   Selwyn Richardson, the justice and national security minister,
said in the call that the agreement called for Robinson's immediate
resignation, with elections to be held within 90 days.
   Richardson said the government granted amnesty to rebel leader
Abu Bakr and his followers in the revolt, which has left at least
nine people dead and led to looting on this island-nation of 1.3
million residents.
   The official said, however, that the agreement was contingent
``upon the safe return of all members of Parliament'' now held
hostage.
   It was unclear when the hostage release might occur.
   The announcement came hours after government and military
spokesmen said negotiations with the radical Moslem group had
collapsed.
   Earlier Monday, security forces exchanged gunfire with the
rebels at both the parliament building and the state-run television
station, the two buildings were hostages were being held.
   Speaking from inside Parliament late Monday, Robinson said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. Joe Theodore, head of
the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator Bilal Abdullah, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister Robinson has just said.''
   The rebels claim Robinson's government is corrupt and
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.
They claimed on Saturday to have wired Robinson with explosives and
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said Robinson was shot in both
feet and Richardson was shot in one leg when rebels stormed
Parliament.
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams reported that the Moslems were
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, Williams said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since Friday. He said Anglican
negotiator Knolly Clarke told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   The two sides nearly reached agreement earlier Monday but a
government official said negotiations stalled over conditions for
releasing the hostages, who include eight Cabinet ministers.
   Shaw said 41 hostages were being held and about 100 rebels were
involved in the siege.
   He said 16 hostages, including the government ministers, were
being held in the parliament building. The remaining 25 hostages
are all employees of the government TV station, he said.
   Among the dead were six rebels, two police officers and one
civilian, Williams said. Six rebels were known to be wounded.
Williams said three soldiers were wounded, none seriously.
   The State Department said Monday in Washington there are no
plans for U.S. military intervention in Trinidad. Deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher refused comment on reports of U.S. military
maneuvers in the area, but suggested a military solution was ruled
out.
   Boucher said none of the estimated 6,000 Americans living in
Trinidad and neighboring Tobago were reported hurt.
   He criticized Libya's involvement, saying the radical North
African Arab nation trained Trinidadian insurgents. But he said no
apparent direct link existed between Libya and the hostage-taking
in Trinidad.
   Shaw and Williams called a news conference hours after a gun
battle between security forces and rebels at the state-run Trinidad
and Tobago Television complex.
   Williams said rebels fired on troops in an apparent attempt to
escape the TV complex. ``We were fired upon; we fired back,'' he
said. ``We won the firefight. They withdrew.''
   Three buildings in the area were set ablaze, witnesses said.
   Sporadic gunfire also broke out at the parliament building,
about a mile away, where the ministers were held. The army said no
attempt was made to storm either building.
   Army chief Col. Ralph Brown said he did not think the hostages
suffered casualties.
   Jamaica said Monday it sent 120 soldiers to neighboring Barbados
to assist Trinidad if needed.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam in 1980, founded
Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic, in
1984. The group is believed to number 250 to 300.
   Shaw said a 6 p.m. to noon curfew would remain in effect
islandwide despite a ``significant diminishing'' in looting, which
caused an estimated $50 million damage to downtown stores.
   In a statement read on state radio, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Lucy Hall urged all American tourists in Trinidad to obey the
curfew.
   Caribbean leaders gathering in Kingston, Jamaica, for a
conference added regional security to their agenda because of
Trinidad and Tobago. Heads of state and other government leaders
from the 13 member nations will open the Caribbean Economic
Community conference on Tuesday.
   Robinson easily won the 1986 parliamentary elections. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until 1991.

   James Brown's wife was turned down as his
sponsor for live-at-home work release because she, too, is a
convicted felon.
   ``This is just one more thing to give us aggravation,'' Adrienne
Brown said. ``The entire system is unfair. They're going to ride us
into the ground.''
   The soul singer's application for so-called extended work
release was denied last week by the state Corrections Department
because of Mrs. Brown's criminal record, department spokesman
Francis Archibald said Monday.
   Mrs. Brown was convicted of possession of PCP in 1989 and was
placed on five years' probation and fined $5,000.
   Brown was released from prison in April after 15 months of a
six-year sentence for aggravated assault and avoiding police in a
two-state auto chase in 1988.
   He lives at a work release center in Aiken. Mrs. Brown said her
husband probably will remain there until he is eligible for parole
in December 1991.

<HEAD>Official Organic Label Helps Give Farm Bill Environmental Flavor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   This year's farm bill may take the worry out
of shopping for organic cucumbers.
   Other provisions apparently headed for adoption in Congress
would stop exports of pesticides banned domestically, expand
protection of wetlands and erodible fields and encourage farmers to
cut their use of chemicals that can find their way into the water
supply.
   The legislation, which sets agricultural policy for the next
five years, has at its heart a set of support programs for crops
and livestock.
   But this year's bill focused as never before on measures
intended to protect the Earth and its waters, drafted under the
watchful eye of lobbyists for environmental groups, farmers and the
chemical industry.
   ``It is an environmentally conscious farm bill,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., the Agriculture Committee chairman, said after the
Senate passed its version, 70-21, last Friday.``It is one that
allows us to do the things Americans want.''
   The House is expected to finish work on its version this week.
The effort to resolve differences between the House and Senate
bills in conference committee, however, is going to have to wait
for the outcome of budget negotiations.
   Those talks are likely to force a cut in planned spending on
farm support programs in order to bring down the overall price tag,
estimated at $54 billion over five years for the Senate measure.
   The Senate bill provides for a new official Agriculture
Department ``organically produced'' label for meats, fruits and
vegetables raised without synthetic chemicals. It is likely to be
added to the House measure.
   Environmental activists who backed the provision, to be known as
the Organic Foods Production Act, said confusion over what is or
isn't organically grown has discouraged consumers and grocers
alike, slowing a movement to cut chemical use in farming.
   ``People have been selling products they said were more
healthful because they didn't use certain pesticides or
fertilizers,'' said Janet Hathaway, a senior project attorney who
follows the issue for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group.
   But different rules on various chemicals apply in different
states, with no rules in some states and very little enforcement in
others, she said.
   Under the bill, a 13-member National Organic Standards Board
would help draw up a list of substances that will be approved or
barred for anyone who wants to call his operation an organic farm.
   States still could run their own organic certification programs,
as some already do. Food still could be called ``organic'' on the
label so long as at least half of its ingredients are organically
produced, but the official USDA stamp would only go to 100 percent
organic products.
   The Senate also agreed to prohibit exports of pesticides
considered too dangerous for use in American farming.
   In what is known as a ``circle of poison,'' such pesticides
sometimes have been found to return to the United States as residue
on imported foods.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee said it also wanted to protect
American farmers from unfair competition from foreign producers
using U.S.-made pesticides that can't be used here.
   Other sections of the bill would authorize $250 million in
research on how farmers could use fewer chemicals, direct the
Agriculture Department to study how its grading standards offer
incentives for excessive pesticide use and require, for the first
time, that farmers keep records of pesticides they use.
   Still unresolved is a dispute over access to the pesticide
records. The Senate bill would allow only certain government
agencies to see them, but environmentalists hope the House will
vote to allow extensive public access to the information.
   Both the Senate and House bills would expand programs to protect
fragile wetlands and fields susceptible to erosion from farmers
eager to expand their acreage. The bills also would enact new
programs to preserve privately owned forests.

   In this city of bureaucrats, lawyers and
computer nerds, how many good, old-fashioned macho men are left?
   You guessed it, folks.
   When the Kennedy Center announced auditions for ``macho he-men''
to perform as extras in the Australian Ballet's production of
``Spartacus'' this week, only 36 showed up.
   Worse, nearly half of them were politely ushered to the door as
impostors.
   The audition fliers posted on bulletin boards at congressional
offices, gyms and dance studios around town included a photograph
of exactly the kind of guy the Kennedy Center was looking for _ a
lean and mean Roman gladiator clad in a flimsy loin cloth, his
rippling muscles straining to burst his leather chest straps.
   What shuffled into the rehearsal hall of the Kennedy Center
Opera House on Monday evening fell roughly into two categories:
health spa muscleman and your standard couch potato.
   They were short and tall, potbellied and trim, balding and
longhaired, dressed in jeans, T-shirts and shorts. One wore a
striped shirt and tie. Few seemed likely candidates for Hungarian
choreographer Laszlo Seregi's balletic tale of a slave revolt in
ancient Rome.
   One who didn't make the cut was Eugene Woodruff, 57, of suburban
Annandale, Va., a supervisor at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office who took his disappointment good-naturedly.
   Woodruff has been a supernumerary, or extra, with the Washington
Opera a few times, mostly just standing around on stage, but never
in a ballet.
   ``I'm not a dancer at all,'' he said with a smile. ``I don't
take part in any strenuous athletics. For exercise, the only thing
I do is rifle shooting. I also mow the lawn and saw some firewood.''
   The lure for Woodruff couldn't be the money. The 19 extras
selected to play Roman soldiers and slaves in ``Spartacus'' will
receive $28 for four rehearsals and $40 for four performances
starting Friday.
   The extras in opera productions are paid considerably less, but
the pay for ``Spartacus'' is higher because there is ``lots of
marching and escaping and running around on stage,'' said Steve
Quinn, the Kennedy Center's liaison with the Australian Ballet.
   Colin Peasley, the touring ballet company's ballet master, chose
19 of the more athletic-looking candidates and began an intensive
drill to whip them into shape as Roman soldiers and slaves.
   ``Left, right, left, right,'' he barked as the extras marched
across the floor to piano music from Aram Khachaturian's score.
   Grabbing a wooden spear, Peasley said, ``These are held like you
hold a thermometer, under your arm like this.'' He taught the
neophyte guards how to sway without getting dizzy, and how to
crouch without ``looking like you're sitting on the toilet.''
   He held a Roman warrior's shield to his chest. ``You must be
careful how you hold a shield or they begin to look like a
handbag,'' he said.
   Woodruff enjoyed his past moments of glory in the operatic
limelight, no matter how obscure, but he had no pretensions.
   ``I have no illusions about being a great actor,'' he said. ``I
do it for the fun of it. It's a chance to do theater that's
big-time, without having any real professional skills.''

<HEAD>On 25th Anniversary, Panel Says Health Care Insurance Net Has Many
Holes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one disagrees that Medicare and Medicaid
have helped millions of Americans over the past quarter century,
but critics say these two health care safety nets have developed
too many large holes.
   ``When these programs were enacted, many persons expected that
Medicare and Medicaid would ensure full coverage of all health care
services for the elderly, disabled and poor,'' said Rep. Edward
Roybal, D-Calif.
   Though ``much has been accomplished ... there remain many gaps
and weaknesses in the programs,'' Roybal, chairman of the House
Select Committee on Aging, said in a report released at a hearing
of the panel on Monday.
   With health care costs rising twice as fast as inflation, the
price of private medical insurance is getting beyond the reach of
many, employers are trimming coverage and states are reducing their
Medicaid rolls to cut costs.
   Though taxpayers spend more than $174 billion a year on the
programs, an estimated 37 million Americans have no health
insurance, and Medicaid covers only 42 percent of those living in
poverty. And, Roybal said, 200 million people are underinsured for
catastrophic or long-term illness.
   The 25th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, which were signed
into law June 30, 1965, provided an opportunity for those who want
to change the nation's health care system to highlight problems in
the government insurance programs.
   But before the hard hitting began, Roybal and other members of
the committee marked the anniversary with a large sheet cake, iced
with white frosting and trimmed in red, white and blue.
   The celebratory mood turned serious as Roybal opened the
hearing, outlining the major failings of the two programs.
   ``A national (health insurance) program is a must for this
country,'' said Roybal, who has introduced a bill that would build
Medicare into a federally based, nationwide program covering health
and long-term care.
   The bipartisan Pepper Commission _ 12 members of Congress and
three White House appointees _ has proposed building on the
existing employer-provided insurance system and improving and
expanding the Medicaid program.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman of the Pepper
Commission, said the country has six to eight years to make needed
reforms in the health care system. If nothing is done, ``people are
going to rise up'' in protest, he said.
   Medicaid, a federal-state program that serves more than 26
million poor Americans, is in worse shape than Medicare,
Rockefeller said. Eligibility differs from state to state, and
reimbursement rates are so low in some places that some physicians
refuse to treat Medicaid patients, he said.
   ``It is time to take the lessons we have learned over these 25
years and put them to use in finally building a universal health
system,'' he said.
   Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care Financing Administration,
which handles Medicare and Medicaid, said any changes in the
nation's health care system should build on the current system and
should not strain the U.S. economy.
   ``If we decide to fill insurance gaps, we must do so in a way
that does not lead to overwhelming financial gaps in the future. We
must make sure that we do not create incentives that contribute to
unnecessary utilization and overspending,'' she said.
   The Bush administration is conducting a review of the quality,
accessibility and cost of the nation's health care system. Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who is leading the
review, has not said what changes he will recommend, but he has
rejected national health insurance as a solution.

   Mayor Marion Barry says he doesn't foresee any
rioting in the streets of Washington if he is convicted in his
cocaine and perjury trial.
   ``We (blacks) have grown as a people in the last 20 years, and
we are not going to destroy what we have brought back,'' Barry told
reporters Monday after the prosecution and defense wound up their
presentations of evidence.
   ``Those who talk about that don't represent me,'' said Barry.
   Barry said he didn't believe rioting would really happen. He
scoffed at some local press reports on the possibility of rioting
like that which happened in the nation's capital when civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968.
   ``Frankly, I really don't see (rioting) happening no matter what
happens,'' Barry said. ``I want to say I have heard no serious
consideration of anything like that.''
   Testimony on the 14 criminal charges against the mayor lasted
six weeks. The two sides called 44 witnesses.
   Barry's trial is expected to go to the jury Thursday, following
closing arguments that are likely to last all of Wednesday, said
presiding U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   Jackson said he is giving each side 2{ hours for making final
arguments to the jury. Instructions to the jury probably will be
given Thursday morning.
   Jackson said he is leaning toward dismissing the six alternate
jurors following jury instructions.
   The six have been sequestered, along with the 12 jurors in the
case, since the jury was seated in the case in mid-June.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession, one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy and three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use before

   Three American films form a ``small but
robust'' core at the heart of this year's 47th Venice Film
Festival, festival director Guglielmo Biraghi says.
   The festival _ Italy's most important annual film event _
features 21 films from 19 countries in the competition for the
Golden Lion Award.
   The U.S. entries include Spike Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues,''
Martin Scorsese's ``Goodfellas,'' and James Ivory's ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge.''
   The festival, which runs from Sept. 4 to Sept. 15, will be
judged by an international panel headed by author Gore Vidal.
   Three other U.S. films will be shown outside of competition,
including Warren Beatty's ``Dick Tracy.''
   Other highlights of the festival include a retrospective of
Soviet cinema from 1929 to 1935, a series of films in homage to
cinema greats and several documentaries.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor says she slept on a
horse blanket and the food was terrible, but her three days in jail
for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer were otherwise fairly
pleasant.
   ``I was very happily surprised,'' she said after her release
Monday. ``Everybody was warm and nice and sweet. It was OK. The
Beverly Hills police should come and take lessons from this
police.''
   There was that moment of terror.
   ``At first I was petrified. They even took my makeup away,'' she
said.
   She scolded reporters for a weekend story that her husband,
Frederick Von Anhalt, delivered silk sheets to the jail.
   ``I didn't have silk sheets. I don't even have silk sheets at
home. I was on a horse blanket,'' she said.
   She declared the food ``terrible.''
   Miss Gabor, 72, got 72 hours in jail for smacking a policeman
during a traffic stop last year.
   A judge ordered the sometime actress and former Hungarian beauty
queen to jail for failing to fulfill her original sentence, 120
hours of community service.
   Miss Gabor paid $85 a day to do her time at the El Segundo jail
rather than have the county pick accommodations for her.
   She has also been ordered to pay nearly $13,000 in fines and
restitution.

<HEAD>Trial Sparks Debate Over Coroners' Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coroner who dropped a dead infant
head-first onto the floor as part of his research into skull
fractures is being sued by the child's parents for $2 million in a
case that has divided doctors over such practices.
   Some coroners say such research has been carried out in morgues
for years. Others say the permission of the next of kin should be
required.
   In the trial, which began last month, District Judge Hugh
Brunson must decide whether state law allows coroners to conduct
experiments not needed to determine the cause of death and whether
approval from relatives is needed.
   No state court has previously ruled on the issue. But state
Assistant Attorney General Chuck Yeager said in an opinion last
year that the law does not authorize such experiments without the
permission of the next of kin.
   Dr. Charles Odom, a deputy coroner for Lafayette Parish in
southern Louisiana, was fired by his boss, Coroner Robert P.
Thompson, who found out about the experiment on 4-month-old
Christina Arnaud and informed the parents.
   Dwayne and Ellen Arnaud are seeking damages for emotional
suffering.
   The trial, which is being held in Lafayette, 95 miles west of
New Orleans, is in recess but resumes in August.
   The baby died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1986, and an
autopsy was performed by Odom the same day.
   Odom held the baby by the heels and dropped it onto a concrete
floor. Findings from the experiment were later used in a
manslaughter trial in Hawaii in which charges against a father
accused of killing his child were dismissed.
   Odom, now an assistant medical examiner in Dallas, testified in
the Hawaii trial that he believed the experiments on the infant and
on another baby's corpse proved that children could die from skull
fractures suffered during accidental falls from the arms of an
adult.
   Testifying at the Lafayette trial, Odom said he regarded the
experiment as proper and said such research is not uncommon.
   While the primary purpose of an autopsy is to determine the
cause and manner of death, there is a secondary purpose _ ``to gain
medical knowledge and use that medical knowledge in the service of
the living,'' Odom said.
   Some doctors defended the practice.
   ``I think it's a good thing and a needed thing,'' said Dr. Terry
Welke, Calcasieu Parish coroner. ``There's a lot of knowledge
brought about by experimentation that is not allowed on the living.
It's a good practice to allow it here.''
   Odom and other medical examiners say that skin, bone, eyes,
heart valves and kidneys are often removed from bodies and used
elsewhere, with and without the knowledge of the family.
   Dr. Monroe Samuels, a medical examiner in Orleans Parish, said
requests to experiment on corpses during autopsies are submitted
regularly by medical schools and research centers in New Orleans.
   ``We would only do it if it did not deface or deform the body,''
he said. ``We do have requests for some surgical techniques, but
those are only done with permission of the next of kin. We're not
talking about ghoulish things like leaning on an arm to see how far
it will go before it breaks or shooting a gun at it.''
   Welke said that in his office, doctors have come in to practice
techniques on cadavers before moving on to live patients.
   ``It's done basically because physicians are trying to enhance
their knowledge,'' he said. ``If the practice is cut off, it would
be a big problem.''
   But Dr. Sylvan J. Manuel, St. Landry Parish coroner and
president of the Louisiana Coroners Association, was one of a
number of coroners who said they knew of no experimentation
unrelated to the autopsy being done in Louisiana.
   ``I don't think any of us are doing it, or should do it,''
Manuel said. ``I don't think anything should be done without the
permission of the family. If you're going to take something off the
body _ a fingernail even _ you should have permission of the
family.''
   Jefferson Parish Coroner Robert Treuting testified that
experiments such as the one conducted by Odom help doctors and
researchers perfect operating techniques and find cures for illness.
   Treuting said orthopedists have practiced dissecting joints on
cadavers awaiting autopsies, and researchers took some parts from a
body to study hardening of the arteries.
   Pathologists have the right to do anything they want with the
body, including keeping it, if there is a legitimate research
reason, Treuting testified.
   But he said it would be callous for the survivors to be told of
experiments because it would compound their anguish.

<TEXT>
   Chiquita Brands International says
it has accepted a proposal by President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
for a 25.4 percent wage hike to end a ruinous month-old strike by
its 10,000 banana workers.
   There was no immediate reaction from the union to the
Cincinnati-based company's announcement Monday that it would raise
the basic wage by $62.50 to $308.50 a month.
   The union had ordered the walkout June 25 to back demands for a
a 54.57 percent wage increase. Chiquita, which handles nearly
two-thirds of Honduras' banana exports, at first refused to
negotiate then drew the line at 14.33 percent.
   In an address to the nation on Sunday night, Callejas called the
strike ruinous for Honduras' impoverished economy and threatened to
take unspecified legal action if Chiquita and the union did not
accept his proposal for a 25.4 percent increase.
   The strike has been marked by sporadic violence. Police said the
latest incident occurred Monday night outside Chiquita's main
office at La Lima, 200 miles north of Tegucigalpa, when two workers
were wounded in a shootout.
   A police report on the incident gave no details.
   Strikers armed with sticks and stones have also fought during
the past week with about 400 workers who wanted to return to work.
   Bananas is Honduras' principal export, earning the country about
$400 million annually.
   Chiquita has been operating in Honduras since 1912 and currently
exports 50 million cases of bananas a year. The rest is handled by
Castle and Cook of San Francisco.
   Chiquita's announcement said the company incurred a loss of
$14.45 million in production during the strike.

   When a big trial happens in a small town,
finding an impartial jury can get complicated.
   It seems that everyone, from potential witnesses to prospective
jurors, knows everyone else in the trial of Shirley Kinge, who
faces charges connected to the slaying last year of a couple and
their two children.
   Jury selection began last week, when 290 of 300 prospective
jurors questioned were dismissed.
   One woman had taught nearly a dozen potential witnesses in her
seventh-grade home economics class. One man's cousin lived across
the street from Mrs. Kinge. Another woman said her son's best
friend was dating the defense attorney's daughter.
   All but one prospective juror questioned said they had read and
heard news reports about the slayings of Warren Harris, 39, his
wife, Dolores, 41, and their children, 11-year-old Marc and
15-year-old Shelby.
   A new pool of 100 potential jurors was called to court Monday.
By then, lawyers had agreed on 10 jurors for the panel, which will
ultimately have 12 jurors and two to four alternates. Jury
selection continues this week.
   The trial in Ithaca is expected to last at least until
September, with more than 300 possible witnesses. The length of the
trial, the number of witnesses and the notoriety of the case are
making jury selection ``as difficult as it could be,'' said Judge
William Barrett.
   The slain couple and their children were each bound and shot in
the head the night of Dec. 22 at their home in Dryden, near Ithaca
in this county of 88,000 people. The bodies were doused with
gasoline and set on fire.
   Mrs. Kinge's son, Michael, was a suspect but was killed in a
shootout in February when police went to his home to arrest him.
   Mrs. Kinge, 55, was indicted on charges of arson, burglary,
possession of stolen property and other offenses. She is accused of
helping her son set the fires at the Harris house and using credit
cards stolen from the family.
   One prospective juror's mail carrier may be a witness. Another
worked for the same company as Harris. One volunteered in the
election campaign of the district attorney, and another was the
football coach for the sons of Mrs. Kinge's lawyer, William
Sullivan.
   Aiden Payne, a home economics teacher in Dryden, had taught so
many of the town's firefighters and police officers that Barrett
asked, ``Is there anyone in Dryden you don't know?''
   Sullivan said he was troubled by the extent to which potential
jurors had followed the case and expressed opinions about it.
   District Attorney George Dentes would not comment on the jury
headaches, but the judge said knowing about the case does not mean
a person cannot be a fair juror.
   ``It isn't the fact that you've heard of it, it's your state of
mind,'' he said. ``This trial is not about what's been written in
the newspapers, it's about what's presented in court.''
   A number of prospective jurors said they could not set aside
their opinions about the case, but Barrett said they are in the
minority.
   ``I have great confidence in our juries in Ithaca,'' he said.
``We'll find a fair and impartial jury. We're doing it carefully
and painstakingly, but we'll get there.''

   After losing $4.2 million last year on an
electronic information network for doctors, the American Medical
Association is conceding that physicians aren't ready to be
computer jockeys.
   The association plans to discontinue AMA-Net, its national
medical information database, on Aug. 10 for lack of interest.
   ``It's a very regretful decision,'' James F. Rappel, AMA vice
president for information resources, said Monday. ``We really have
a product we don't have to apologize for at all.''
   But he said a lack of computer literacy and personal computers
and doctors' failure so far to incorporate the idea into their
practices were to blame.
   Subscriptions to AMA-Net were touted as a way for doctors to
keep up with latest on everything from drugs and diseases to stock
prices and airline operations.
   The AMA has lost about $4.2 million on AMA-Net since it began
offering it to its 280,000-plus members in early 1989, Rappel said.
At the time, it was estimated the system would break even if 40,000
subscribers spent $15 to $20 per month using it.
   ``Although we got the number of subscribers we thought we would
need, only 13,000 of them were using the service,'' said Rappel.
More than two-thirds of the subscribers never even logged on to use
the system, he said.
   ``The use of such a thing in a physician's daily practice _ it's
not there yet,'' Rappel said. ``It will be. It's very close.''

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest Veteran Dies at 105</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George E. Echols, who fought in France during
World War I and was the nation's oldest known war veteran, is dead
at the age of 105, the Department of Veterans Affairs says.
   The department said Echols died last Thursday at the VA Medical
Center here after a brief illness.
   Echols' passing means that the oldest known American war veteran
is now Nathan E. Cook, 104, who is also the only known living
veteran of the Spanish-American War era, the VA said.
   Cook now lives at the Carl Hayden VA Nursing Home in Phoenix,
Ariz.
   In addition to his Spanish-American War service, Cook served
with the Navy during the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Philippine
Insurrection, clashes on the U.S.-Mexican border and in World War I
and World War II.
   Echols who was born Nov. 2, 1884 in Athens, Ga., served with the
Army from June 16, 1914 to October 10, 1919. After receiving an
honorable discharge, he re-enlisted and served an additional year.
   He was a graduate of Timothy High School in Athens and also
attended the Jericho Baptist Institute there.
   According to the VA, Echols worked for a railroad after his Army
service and was also employed by the Mexican Embassy here.
   Echols is survived by a stepdaughter, Annie Kent of Silver
Spring, Md.
   A resident at the nursing home care unit since 1988, Echols once
said that his personal secret to long life was ``trust and belief
in God.''

   President Bush's son Neil agrees with
regulators on a host of facts in his savings and loan case while
continuing to deny he had any conflict of interest.
   The younger Bush was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association of Denver, which failed in December 1988 at a
cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   In a document released Monday by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, Bush and the regulators said they agreed on 110 points
ranging from Bush's date of birth (Jan. 22, 1955) to complex loans
and business transactions.
   The 34-page document, called a joint stipulation of uncontested
facts, consists of information previously made public, according to
the OTS and Bush's attorney, James Nesland.
   However, it pulls together details about Bush's oil exploration
company and its relationship with Silverado borrowers Kenneth M.
Good and Bill L. Walters, as well as votes that Bush made as a
director approving loans to the two men.
   OTS officials have accused Bush of conflict of interest in
failing to disclose his business relationships with Good and
Walters to the Silverado board.
   The joint stipulation, requested in late May by Administrative
Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson, is part of the proceeding in the Bush
case. Bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing Sept. 25
in Denver before Davidson, who will then make a recommendation to
OTS Director Timothy Ryan.
   In addition to the OTS case, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against Bush and other
Silverado directors.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman told the House Banking
Committee on Monday that the agency will decide ``in the reasonably
near future'' whether to sue Bush and other directors of the
collapsed thrift.
   The document released Monday traced the investments made by Good
and Walters in Bush's company, JNB Exploration Co., which drilled a
succession of dry holes in Wyoming and failed to become profitable.
   For an investment of $100, Bush acquired 23.4 percent of the
business in January 1983. His active partners, geologists James B.
Judd and Evans G. Nash Jr., held 23.4 percent and 15.6 percent,
respectively, for investments of $100 and $66. The name JNB came
from the initials of Judd, Nash and Bush.
   The ``silent'' partners were Walters, who invested $300,000 for
a 12.5 percent stake, and Good, who made an initial investment of
$10,000 for 25 percent.
   Good also guaranteed lines of credit for hundreds of thousands
of dollars to JNB from Cherry Creek National Bank, which was
controlled by Walters.
   In addition, Good personally lent Bush $100,000 so that Good
could trade in a commodities pool on Bush's behalf. Bush was
allowed to keep any profits that might be earned but was not
required to repay the loan if the pool wasn't profitable. The
venture was unprofitable and Bush never repaid the loan.
   In January 1985, Nash dropped out of JNB and Judd sold part of
his interest to Bush. Good bought part of Nash's interest, raising
his share to 33.7 percent.
   Walters withdrew from the partnership in August 1986. By late
1987, Good's share had jumped to 79 percent, while Judd had 7.4
percent and Bush held 12.5 percent. Bush was named managing
partner, with authority for the management and operations of the
business. Bush withdrew from JNB in May 1989.
   The document noted that Bush voted as a director to approve some
loans by Silverado to Good and Walters but did not vote on others.

<HEAD>Shanghai Enacts Stricter Birth Control Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shanghai, China's largest city with a population
of more than 12 million, will start fining couples who have a
second child an amount equal to three times their annual income, an
official newspaper reported.
   In most regions of China, current fines are 10 percent of income.
   Stricter birth control regulations to take effect Aug. 1 will
end ``second-child'' privileges for farmers living in Shanghai's
outskirts, for oil workers and for brothers and children of
revolutionary martyrs, said the Xinmin (New People's) Daily report,
which was seen in Beijing today.
   Couples in second marriages will be allowed to have a second
child only if they already have one child between them, the paper
said.
   The report said that couples who have an illegal second child
will be fined three times the total of their average annual income
for the two years before the birth. Couples who have a third or
more children without permission will be fined four to six times
their annual income, it said.
   Payment of the fines could be extended for only six years, and
at least 25 percent must be paid within the first year, the report
said.
   In most regions of China, current fines are 10 percent of income
for up to 14 years after the birth of a second child.
   The average wage in Shanghai last year was 2,500 yuan ($530),
according to the Municipal Statistics Bureau.
   China adopted a one-child per couple policy in 1980. The rule is
widely observed in crowded cities, where women usually have jobs,
but is widely ignored in rural areas where families are willing to
pay fines in order to have more children to help on their farms.
   Shanghai already has China's lowest population growth rate _ 6.4
per 1,000. The national average is 14.2. The city says the stricter
regulations are needed because current birth rates are exceeding
previously set targets.
   The government has acknowledged that its target of limiting
population _ currently estimated at 1.1 billion _ to 1.2 billion in
the year 2000 is not attainable.
   Estimates for the number of Chinese at the turn of the century
have climbed to 1.3 billion, about 20 percent of the total world
population.

<HEAD>House Votes to Cut Military Construction Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, in a step certain to rile the White
House, has approved an $8.3 billion military construction bill that
slashes President Bush's request for overseas projects, including a
new base in Italy.
   By a 312-82 vote late Monday, the House adopted the legislation
that cuts $815 million from the president's proposal for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 and $183 million from the amount Congress
approved last year for fiscal 1990.
   Among the other expected issues of contention is deferral of
$254 million for placing MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars and a
cut of $37 million from the $92 million Bush sought for facilities
for the B-2 bomber at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
   While reducing funds for overseas projects, the bill leaves
domestic work largely intact, and, in some cases, increases
spending for projects in the home states of members of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on military construction.
   The administration said it opposed the legislation, citing a
$170 million reduction in money for the NATO Infrastructure Fund
and a $226 million increase for the National Guard and Reserve.
   The action on a new facility in Italy also is likely to draw the
administration's ire.
   The House banned the use through Sept. 30, 1991, of any U.S.
money from the NATO fund for building a new air base in Crotone,
Italy, for the Air Force's 401st Tactical Wing.
   Spain has said the wing of 72 F-16 jet fighters must be moved
from Torrejon de Ardoz, and following negotiations with the United
States, Italy agreed two years ago to provide a new home under NATO
auspices.
   Lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a new base
in Europe when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to the
lessening threat and budget constraints, plans to close others
overseas and at home.
   ``The base agreement is outdated. It's yesterday's solution to
yesterday's problems,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who chairs
the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.
   House approval of the military construction bill came as
Cheney's moratorium on new projects, issued Jan. 24, remains in
effect until Nov. 15. In its report, the military construction
panel criticized the ban as disruptive to the armed forces.
   Noting the possible U.S.-Soviet treaty later this year to cut
conventional forces in Europe and uncertainty surrounding base
closings, the bill trims $287 million from the president's budget
for overseas projects.
   Among the cuts are a reduction from the Pentagon's proposed
amount of $154 million for Germany to $33 million, a total of $33
million for South Korea from Bush's request of $83 million, and $10
million for projects in Italy from the administration's proposal of
$45 million.
   But in North Carolina, home of the subcommittee's chairman,
Democratic Rep. Bill Hefner, the administration proposed $106
million for military construction. The panel increased the total to
about $130 million.
   Among the projects are $2 million for the Cherry Point Marine
Corps Air Station Aviation Museum at Camp Lejeune and $394,000 for
the organizational maintenance shop for the Army National Guard in
Goldsboro.
   The panel's ranking Republican, Bill Lowery, is from California.
The administration proposed spending $314 million for construction
projects there, and the panel increased the amount to $352 million.
   Among the projects the panel added to the legislation were $9
million for barracks for the Army National Guard at Camp San Luis
Obispo and $6 million for a computer center at the Monterey Fleet
Numerical Oceanography Center.
   The panel also includes two other Californians, Democrats Julian
Dixon and Vic Fazio.

   Navy searchers using a remote-controlled,
deep-sea submarine said they found what could be the cargo door
that tore off a United Airlines jet, hurling nine people to their
death over the Pacific.
   A metallic object that could be by the 10-by-10-foot door was
found wedged in the ocean floor Monday in 15,000 feet of water 90
miles south of Honolulu, near where the Boeing 747 ripped open last
year, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson.
   The sub's sonar located the debris, but searchers were unable to
get a picture with the sub's video camera to help confirm whether
the debris is from Flight 811, he said.
   Searchers aboard a 224-foot Navy tug recorded the location and
were to return to Honolulu today, Anderson said.
   The Navy will report the find to the National Transportation
Safety Board, which will decide whether to try to recover the
debris, he said.
   The jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it left Honolulu for
New Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.
   Shortly after takeoff, a cargo door opened at 22,000 feet,
tearing away a section of fuselage. Nine people were swept to their
deaths and five others suffered serious injuries. The crew managed
to return the jet to Honolulu.
   The NTSB inquiry determined that faulty design of the locking
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the
door was locked.
   It blamed United, Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to correct problems with the door.
   The NTSB asked the Navy to find the door in hopes an examination
of it would lead to better plane safety.
   The search began Wednesday. The Orion submarine searched 24
square miles of the ocean floor.

<HEAD>Ex-Communist Leader Zhivkov Refuses to Appear Before Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed Communist leader Todor Zhivkov,
under investigation for abuses during more than 30 years in power,
says he will not appear before Parliament this week to defend his
record.
   Zhivkov, who is under house arrest, earlier had requested to
speak to lawmakers to ``tell the Bulgarian people the truth'' about
his tenure.
   The 78-year-old Zhivkov was ousted Nov. 10 in a Politburo coup
by Communist colleagues who pledged reform, changed their party's
name to Socialist and then won a parliamentary majority in June
multiparty elections.
   He has been under investigation for abuse of power,
misappropriation of state property and incitement to national
hatred. Prosecutors have yet to file any formal charges, and no
trial date has been set.
   In a letter read in the Grand National Assembly by Deputy
Chairman Ivan Glushkov on Monday, Zhivkov said ``I do not want to
be a toy in the hands of whatever political grouping.'' He cited
what he said were arguments against his appearance prior to a
possible trial.
   ``As (former) party and state leader I bear the greatest
responsibility for that has happened in Bulgaria in the last
decades, both good and bad ... I have made mistakes, but no
crimes,'' Zhivkov said in the letter.
   Stoyan Ganev, a spokesman for the opposition Union of Democratic
Forces (UDF), said Zhivkov was now posing conditions for his
appearance.
   He added it was now unclear when Zhivkov would speak, but he did
not think this would happen in the next few days.
   The session was broadcast live on state television.
   Also Monday, lawmakers failed for a fifth time to elect a new
president despite a compromise offered by the Socialist Party to
try to overcome the country's worsening political crisis.
   In the presidential vote, Viktor Vulkov, the leader of the
mainstream Agrarian Party, a former ally of the Communists, failed
to get the necessary two-thirds majority in Parliament despite the
Socialists' decision to withdraw their candidate.
   Petar Maldenov resigned as president earlier this month after
experts confirmed the authenticity of a video in which he called
for the use of tanks against anti-government demonstrators in
December.
   Socialist Party leader Alexander Lilov told lawmakers that his
party, wihc holds 211 of 400 seats in Parliament, was withdrawing
its candidate for president, Chavdar Kyuranov.
   Kyuranov, a 69-year-old ex-dissident philosopher, has received
the most votes in the balloting so far but could not get the
necessary two-thirds majority. With Kyuranov's candidacy withdrawn,
there were only two candidates competing for the presidency.
   In the fifth ballot, Vulkov received 257 of 389 votes cast but
fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority. Opposition
candidate Petar Dertliev, the 74-year-old Social Democrat leader
imprisoned by the Communists in the late 1940s, received 130 votes.
   The house postponed a sixth ballot until today.

<HEAD>House Passes Food Label Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nutritional labeling on packaged food would be
more prominent and easier to read under legislation receiving
unanimous House approval.
   The bill approved by voice vote Monday would require that
specific information about nutritional value and number of calories
be highlighted on food labels by larger type, bold type or
contrasting color.
   It also would require that any claims about the food be
consistent with government definitions. For example, if a product
claims to be low in salt or light, the manufacturer must be using
the standards set by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The bill does not pre-empt state laws on health warnings, but it
does supersede state laws on health claims, nutrition and
ingredient labeling for the sake of uniformity.
   Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
   The version passed by the House would require that labels state:
   _Serving size, or unit of measure customarily used.
   _Number of calories per serving and number of calories derived
from fat.
   _Amount of each of the following nutrients: fat, saturated fat,
cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars,
dietary fiber and total protein.
   The measure won ``qualified support'' from the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, which sought to allow states to
supersede federal labeling requirements with their own tougher
rules.
   Congress and the Bush administration have been moving along
similar tracks in the first major reorganization of the nation's
food-labeling system in nearly two decades.
   The Food and Drug Administration earlier this month proposed
sweeping regulations that would require nutrition labeling for
nearly all packaged foods and for fresh produce and seafood.
Earlier, the agency proposed a set of regulations covering health
claims.

<HEAD>State Says Patients of Dentist With AIDS Could be Tested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials said patients of a
Florida dentist who may have given AIDS to a woman during a tooth
extraction could be tracked down and urged to take an AIDS test.
But the patients couldn't be told why.
   Florida law protects the identity of anyone who has AIDS, even
from those who may be infected by that person, officials said
Monday.
   The Centers for Disease Control last week reported a 21-year-old
college student apparently got AIDS from her dentist even though he
wore gloves and a mask.
   The agency said the case was the first in the nation in which a
health professional apparently transmitted AIDS to a patient.
Researchers could not positively say how the woman got infected,
but the CDC did rule out sexual encounters or intravenous drug use.
   State health officials have refused to comment publicly on news
reports that the dentist practices somewhere in Florida. Two
sources, however, confirmed Monday that it was a Florida dentist.
They spoke on condition they were not identified.
   Brian Ballard, Gov. Bob Martinez's chief of staff, said that if
the case originated in Florida, the Health and Rehabilitative
Services Department may, under the law, track down the dentist's
patients and ask them to take AIDS tests.
   The patients would not be told, however, that their connection
to the dentist was the reason they were asked to take an AIDS test,
said HRS spokesman Steve Konicki.
   That same guarantee of confidentiality applies to anyone with
AIDS to encourage them to disclose names of people to whom they may
have transmitted the disease.
   ``Confidentiality is an important part of contact tracing,''
said state Rep. Lois Frankel, chairwoman of the task force that
produced a 1988 Florida AIDS law.

   You say your fax machine is filled with pages

with automatic dialing messages?
   The House hopes it has found a way to limit the electronic
equivalent of ``junk mail.''
   By voice vote, the House approved legislation Monday that would
authorize the Federal Communications Commission to set up a
national clearinghouse for listing telephone subscribers who object
to the endless faxes and unsolicited messages.
   ``This legislation empowers consumers and businesses with the
ability to `just say no' to unsolicited telephone advertisements,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Under the bill, the FCC also would establish penalties for
advertisers who fail to abide by the clearinghouse list.
   Solicitations by charitable and political organizations would be
exempt from the ban.
   Consumers, either private individuals or businesses, could
specify that they do not wish to receive advertising by fax
machines or automatically dialed, prerecorded telephone
solicitations.
   The legislation was crafted in conjunction with the FCC, the
telephone industry and the direct marketing industry, Markey said.

<HEAD>East Germany Agrees To Pay Israel Compensation for Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has agreed to consider paying
Israel compensation for taking in thousands of refugees from Nazi
Germany after World War II.
   The change was reflected in a letter, obtained Monday, from East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere to World Jewish Congress
President Edgar Bronfman which said talks should be convened to
discuss compensation for ``the burden caused to Israel with the
absorption and integration of refugees from Germany.''
   Previously, East Germany had agreed to pay reparations to Jewish
organizations but not to Israel.
   Even with the change, East Germany cannot afford the large sum
of money involved, and negotiations about the amount probably will
take place next year after the East is united with wealthy West
Germany, officials said. The united Germany will assume the
financial responsibilities of the East once unification is
completed by the end of this year.
   Talks on the subject between Israeli and East German officials
broke down in Copenhagen on July 5 on the issue of reparations to
Israel for absorption of the refugees, according to the Israel
Foreign Ministry.
   At Israel's request, the World Jewish Congress then intervened
with the office of de Maiziere, said WJC Executive Director Elan
Steinberg.
   The letter from de Maiziere, said Steinberg, ``emerges as the
voice of Germany's moral conscience.''

<HEAD>Sonar Maker Pleads Guilty in Civil Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manufacturer of sonar devices for nuclear
submarines has pleaded guilty to two felony charges and agreed to
pay $5.1 million to settle a civil suit alleging it overcharged the
Pentagon for labor costs.
   Ametek Inc., pleaded guilty in federal court in San Diego,
Calif., to two charges of making false statements to the government
and was fined $110,000, the Justice Department said Monday in a
news release. The company admitted submitting false estimates of
labor costs to the Pentagon, officials said.
   The company, based in Paoli, Pa., also agreed to pay $5.1
million to settle a lawsuit brought under the False Claims Act, the
department said.
   The suit, originally filed by attorney Alan J. Ludecke, charged
that Ametek had inflated labor costs for making two sonar systems
for the Los Angeles-class attack submarines and Trident missile
subs, the department said.
   Under the terms of the settlement, Ludecke will receive $765,000
or 15 percent of the $5.1 million payment. The False Claims Act
allows whistleblowers to bring lawsuits on behalf of the
government. The Justice Department decided to take over the case
and conducted its own investigation of the allegations first
brought to light by Ludecke.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A Houston couple who decided to
celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their first foreign
vacation haven't gotten the romantic island getaway they planned.
   ``I feel like I've been a hostage here,'' grumbled Melvin Hazel
on Monday.
   ``We're eating a good meal and no one's pointing any guns at
me,'' said his wife, Darlene, confiding: ``I have a lot of sense of
adventure.''
   They're among some two dozen Americans still stranded on this
Caribbean island where Moslem extremists stormed Parliament and the
state television building on Friday, seizing the prime minister and
other officials.
   Some of the Americans have since left the island on one of a few
packed flights by regional carriers. But most have been unable to
leave.
   ``Doesn't the American government have any responsibility for
us? They've shown no intention of helping us,'' said Nancy Schnair,
here with husband Howard Schnair of Chicago on a planned combined
business-vacation trip.
   Lucy Hall, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, said American visitors to
the island were being contacted and assured their government was
concerned about them.
   ``We can't help them because we don't run any airlines,'' Ms.
Hall said of American requests for help getting off Trinidad. She
said some 2,100 U.S. citizens, the great majority of them
residents, are on the islands.
   ``I just want to be somewhere else,'' said Chris Bigalkie, here
on business as regional vice president of Drew Industrial Division.
``We don't have anything like this in Memphis (Tenn., his
hometown).''
   The Schnairs, another couple on a combined business-pleasure
trip _ Martin and Joyce Beckwith of Boston _ and the Hazels of
Houston spent much of Monday morning sitting on the airy veranda of
the Hilton Hotel overlooking this capital city.
   They heard the volleys of gunfire and explosions and saw fire
erupt from the state television complex, where rebels were holding
hostages.
   Hazel, who works in construction, said he and his wife, with
three children in their 20s, wanted to celebrate their 30th
anniversary in style. They had once met some Trinidadians who sang
the praises of their island, and they thought this would be the
perfect place for a long-delayed second honeymoon.
   They arrived Thursday and spent Friday sightseeing. But when
their taxi driver returned Friday evening to take them to dinner at
a seafood restaurant as they requested, he advised them not to go
downtown because of the violence.
   They scrubbed plans to visit sister island Tobago, and now are
only anxious to go home.
   ``They really messed it up for us,'' said Mrs. Hazel.

   The jury that convicted a man of fatally
plunging his 2-year-old stepson headfirst into a toilet returns
Wednesday to decide whether to send him to the electric chair.
   Thomas Coe, 23, was found guilty Monday of child abuse and
murder in the death of Bradley McGee.
   The case led to reforms in the way Florida protects youngsters
considered at risk of child abuse.
   ``He deserves death,'' Pam Kirkland, Bradley's foster mother for
14 months, said of Coe. ``Hopefully this will send a message that a
child is not your property to mistreat or treat any way you want.
It's a child and you will treat him right or else.''
   The jury hears arguments Wednesday on whether Coe should be
sentenced to death or to life in prison without possibility of
parole for 25 years.
   Coe had testified he was ``irate,'' ``steamed,'' and ``out of
control'' in 1989 when he dunked Bradley for soiling his pants
during toilet training. The boy died the next day.
   The case generated a firestorm of criticism of Florida's
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, which was
responsible for supervising Bradley.
   The boy had been under state care from the age of 4 months, when
his mother abandoned him at a mall to a woman who sold pretzels. A
state social worker later recommended he be returned to his mother
and Coe. They had the child only two months before he died.
   The social worker, Margaret Barber, was convicted earlier this
year of child abuse for her role in the case. She never told a
judge about a psychological report that described the couple as
``infantile,'' ``explosive'' and unable to handle children.
   Bradley's death also led to a change in law to make a child's
safety, rather than reuniting families, the top priority of HRS.
   The Legislature passed the ``Bradley McGee Act'' last fall
allocating $79 million for hundreds more child-protection workers.
Also, another law went on the books to protect foster children from
being returned to abusive homes.
   Coe's attorneys urged jurors to convict him of a lesser offense,
such as manslaughter, arguing that the dunking was merely
punishment and that there was no intent to harm the child.
   Prosecutor John Aguero countered: ``There is no rational
explanation for an irrational act. This was a senseless killing.''
   Prosecutors said Bradley's slaying was the culmination of weeks
of bizarre abuse at the hands of his stepfather. Medical experts
testified that Bradley's body was covered with bruises, some of
them up to two weeks old, when he died.
   Coe's wife, Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, testified that he often pushed
the child's face into feces and ground his fist and cayenne pepper
into the boy's genitals.
   Mrs. Coe admitted to sometimes aiding in abuse and beating
Bradley with pillows just before he died. She pleaded no contest to
murder and aggravated child abuse and is serving a 30-year prison
term.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index ended its
seven-day decline with a surge of almost 2 percent today, while the
dollar plunged against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recouped 592.71 points, or
1.95 percent, closing at 31,035.66. The index had lost 2,176.03
points, or 6.58 percent, between July 20 and July 30.
   Traders attributed the index's sharp rebound today to a slip in
long-term interest rates that had been discouraging stock
investor's buying interest.
   ``Participants finally began to pick up underpriced issues after
the consecutive drops,'' said Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with
Nomura Securities Co.
   Also fueling the rebound were rounds of index-linked large-scale
arbitrage buying in an attempt to take profits from price gaps
between the spot and the futures markets, he said.
   However, Umemori said today's surge was unlikely to reverse the
market's recent downward trend because interest rates are still
considered to be high.
   At 4 p.m. the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds stood at 7.530 percent, down from Monday's close
of 7.605 percent. Their price stood at 85.50 points, up from 85.14.
   Stock trading was thin with an estimated 380 million shares
changing hands on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 147.50 yen, down 1.10
yen from Monday's 148.60 finish. It opened at 147.75 yen and ranged
between 147.20 yen and 147.75 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar fell as market players sold the currency
because of pessimism over the U.S. economy, fueled by Friday's
reports of slow growth in the U.S. gross national product in June.
   ``The dollar was especially weaker against European
currencies,'' said Masao Kanemaru, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   With Japanese interest rates going up, market players were less
interested in the U.S. currency, he said.
   Financial markets believe that with the U.S. economy continuing
to slump, the Federal Reserve will push interest rates lower to
help stimulate growth.
   Naohiko Yasuda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, predicted the
dollar's ``downtrend would continue unless there is a visible
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.''
   About $12.97 billion changed hands in spot trading.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Eastern Airlines foreman who pleaded
guilty to falsifying maintenance records says he ignored vital
repairs on orders from superiors.
   Elia Dragone on Monday became the first Eastern employee to
plead guilty in what prosecutors describe as a conspiracy to
overlook maintenance problems.
   Dragone, 29, of Jersey City, N.J., told a federal judge he
altered log books, work cards and other records to make it look as
if vital repairs had been done.
   He said the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors at the
troubled airline to avoid costly flight delays and cancellations.
   Eastern and nine managers were charged last week in an
indictment unprecedented in the airline industry. The indictment
alleges conspiracy, fraud, falsification of documents and
obstruction of justice.
   Dragone was named in 20 counts but pleaded guilty to only two in
a plea bargain _ conspiracy and obstructing an FAA investigation.
He faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count at
sentencing Oct. 17.
   The New York Times reported today that a federal prosecutor is
expected to issue a report criticizing Federal Aviation
Administration officials who did not act on complaints from Eastern
pilots and mechanics who said repairs were not being completed and
maintenance records were being falsified.
   The report says FAA officials thought the complaints were
related to a labor dispute in which they did not want to get
involved, the newspaper said.
   Among those also indicted were Edward Upton, former vice
president of maintenance and engineering, and Thomas Lewis,
Eastern's maintenance director for the Washington-to-Montreal
region.
   They and the other defendants are to be arraigned Aug. 6.

<HEAD>Police Suspect Extremists in Burning of Three Nara Shrines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wooden buildings at three separate Shinto shrines
burned down in western Japan early today in nearly simultaneous
fires, police said.
   The fires broke out between 1:19 a.m. and 1:32 a.m. _ at shrines
in the Nara Prefecture (state) cities of Kashihara, Yamatotakada,
and Gose, police said.
   The shrines are widely identified with the history of the
imperial family and prefecture police official said extremists
opposed to the scheduled November coronation of Emperor Akihito may
have been responsible.
   No injuries were reported, but six buildings were destroyed.
   Shintoism is Japan's indigenous religion based on nature
worship, shamanism and elaborate ceremonial rites.
   The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
authorities had found several batteries and pieces of lead that
could have been used to trigger fire bombs.
   Of the three ancient shrines, the Iwasononi Imasu Taku Mushitama
Shrine in Yamatotakada City was most heavily damaged. Its main
building and the hall of worship, totaling 212.5 square yards, were
destroyed.
   Nara, the nation's capital between 710 and 794, has many sites
related to the imperial family.
   Police believe that two other incidents, in which two stolen
cars in Nara were bombed on the same day, may be connected to the
fires.
   Groups including the Chukakuha (Middle Core Faction) and other
radical leftist groups oppose the monarchy and have vowed to use
violence to disrupt ceremonies connected with the coronation.
   The groups particularly oppose the coronoation's rice ceremony _
during which the new emperor is believed to commune with the gods.
They claim it is a remnant of prewar nationalism.
   The ceremony is to be conducted 10 days after Akihito's Nov. 12
coronation.
   Chukakuha claimed credit for an arson attack that destroyed a
Shinto shrine in Akita, northern Japan, in early July.

<TEXT>
   OK, so John Cleves Symmes' theory that the
world is hollow was a little weird. But his hometown's still proud
of him.
   A 150-year-old stone monument to the philosopher has been
removed from Symmes Park for restoration. The monument _ a pedestal
topped by a 20-inch globe with openings at the poles _ is chipped
and worn.
   ``We are dedicating the finished product as a bicentennial gift
to the city,'' said Sonia August of a conservation group. The town
was founded in 1791.
   Symmes' 1826 ``Theory of Concentric Spheres'' won popular
backing in the 19th century and led to the formation of the Hollow
Earth Society.
   He argued the Earth is made up of five spheres, one within the
other, with openings at each pole wide enough for explorers to
travel from one end to the other.
   The concept, he said, explained reports of open water around the
northern ice rim, northward migration of birds and animals, and
lights in the northern sky.

<TEXT>
   A jury acquitted a former Mexican policeman
of murder in the 1985 torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena but convicted him of kidnapping and other charges.
   Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, 31, a bodyguard for drug traffickers,
on Monday became the second defendant acquitted of murder in the
case, which has strained relations between the United States and
Mexico.
   Deliberations were to resume today for two other defendants,
neither of whom is charged with Camarena's murder. Ruben Zuno Arce,
a businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria, is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy, and Javier
Vasquez Velasco, a former bodyguard, is charged of murdering two
American tourists in an apparent mistake killing.
   Bernabe was convicted of kidnapping, racketeering and aiding the
escape of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, whose Guadalajara
home was the scene of Camarena's torture and slaying.
   Bernabe could get life in prison for the kidnapping and
racketeering plus 10 years for the third offense at sentencing
Sept. 24.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered lawyers not to
comment until all verdicts have been returned.
   The government alleges Caro was among those who interrogated and
killed Camarena and his Mexican pilot. Prosecutors said the
slayings were revenge for Drug Enforcement Administration raids on
marijuana and cocaine plantations that cost the drug barons $5
billion in profits.
   Caro was convicted in Mexico. He is one of 20 people serving
sentences there in the case.
   Bernabe, the only one of the defendants to testify during the
trial, admitted he was a bodyguard for drug traffickers but denied
any role in Camarena's abduction and slaying.
   He also was acquitted of conspiracy to kidnap Camarena and of
racketeering in the kidnap and murder of Camarena's pilot, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar.
   Last week, the jury convicted a Honduran drug kingpin, Juan
Ramon Matta Ballesteros, of the Camarena kidnapping but also
acquitted of the actual murder.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street
in 1985. Testimony showed that the agent was taken to Caro's house,
where he was tortured and interrogated by drug lords before being
slain along with Avelar.
   Their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles from
Guadalajara.

   Carnegie Mellon University is hoping to give
the bagpipe a wee bit of respectability.
   The school this fall will offer a new music degree in bagpiping.
   ``We think we'll be able to legitimize the instrument, which
when you think about it has been around a lot longer than some we
use in orchestras,'' said Marilyn Taft Thomas, director of the
university's music department.
   Vince Mulhern, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering,
applied for the program, which will accept only two students a year.
   ``I was getting tired of engineering and this is intriguing,''
Mulhern said Friday. ``When my friends hear about this they laugh,
but no one has said to me I'm crazy. Of course I don't know what
they say behind my back.''

   Bob Kessel has an honest stranger to
thank for saving him from a $3,000 goof.
   Kessel unknowingly sold that much in jewelry belonging to his
daughter for $15 at a garage sale.
   A newspaper ran a story about the mishap, and the man who bought
the haul appeared Sunday on Kessel's doorstep.
   ``He said, `I've brought your jewelry back,''' Kessel said. ``I
said, `I've had enough jewelry jokes for one day.'''
   The man, who wouldn't identify himself, refused to take either a
$200 reward Kessel offered or the $15 he paid for the jewelry in
the first place.
   ``The guy said that he's had this kind of thing happen before.
If people don't try to get it back, it's a find for him. But if
they realize they've made a mistake, then he gives it back to
them,'' Kessel said.
   A gold coin and silver locket were not returned. Kessel said the
man already had sold them.

<HEAD>Government Orders Second Hijacker Extradited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today ordered a second
teen-age hijacker returned for trial in the Soviet Union, saying
Sweden could not afford to be known as a haven for hijackers.
   Acting Justice Minister Mona Sahlin said Soviet authorities have
guaranteed that Anatoly Michajlenko, 19, will be tried only for the
hijacking, the reason he was being extradited.
   She said the Soviets promised not to charge him with evading
military service, which is not an extraditable crime in Sweden.
   Michajlenko was expected to be sent back within two weeks.
   He was among five young men who hijacked Soviet domestic
airliners in June and early July, three to Sweden and two to
Finland. All five asked to stay, saying they were political
dissidents or fugitives from the Soviet army.
   Besides Michajlenko, Sweden has extradited one hijacker and is
considering the case of another. Finland has said it will extradite
one hijacker and is reviewing the case of the second.
   In ordering the extraditions, Swedish officials have said they
believe democratic changes in the Soviet Union now make it possible
for hijackers to receive a fair trial.
   Human rights groups, Soviet exiles and some Ukrainian
politicians asked that Michajlenko be allowed to stay in Sweden on
humanitarian grounds.
   Ms. Sahlin said after a special Cabinet meeting today that it
was important that Sweden not become a destination for hijackers.
   She said the government will follow Michajlenko's case and, ``We
believe these (Soviet) guarantees are satisfactory'' to ensure that
he is treated as Sweden has asked.

<TEXT>
   Rain fell along Lake Erie and dampened the Northwest early
today. The rest of the nation had mostly dry weather.
   Fog clung to mountainsides in Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia,
and along stretches of the New England seaboard. New Orleans also
had fog.
   The Midwest and Plains had mostly dry weather, and the West was
mostly cloud-free.
   It was raining early today at Cleveland and as far south as
Pittsburgh. A thunderstorm tapered off to a drizzle in Buffalo, N.Y.
   Rain also fell along the western edge of the Rockies in
Washington and Oregon.
   Today's forecast called for hot and humid weather along the East
and Gulf coasts in front of a cold front extending down the
Appalachians and inland, across the South to Texas.
   Scattered thunderstorms and showers along the front were
expected to develop from Maine to Louisiana, but little rain was
expected in many areas.
   Showers were likely over central and west Texas, and rains were
again likely to cause flooding in the region.
   The forecast also called for dry weather across the Midwest, the
central and upper Plains, and the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys.
   Temperatures were expected to soar into the 100s in the desert
Southwest and hit the 90s as far north as Montana.
   Some relief was expected today in the Northwest, as a cold front
was likely to usher in lower temperatures.

   The dollar was lower in quiet trading in Europe
this morning, depressed by pessimism about U.S. economic trends.
   Gold rose strongly in thin trading.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 147.50 yen, down 1.10 yen from
Monday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was still lower at
146.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
   _1.6008 West German marks, down from 1.6085
   _1.3585 Swiss francs, down from 1.3653
   _5.3640 French francs, down from 5.3885
   _1.8110 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8125
   _1,172.00 Italian lire, down from 1,177.50
   _1.1545 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1525
   The British pound rose to $1.8496 from $1.8440 late Monday.
   Dealers said market players sold the dollar based on pessimism
over the U.S. economy, following Friday's reports of slow growth in
the U.S. gross national product in the second quarter.
   ``The dollar was especially weaker against European
currencies,'' said Masao Kanemaru, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   With Japanese interest rates going up, market players were less
interested in the U.S. currency, he said.
   A trader in Milan, Italy predicted the dollar would soon test
the 1.6000-mark level. She said negative sentiment about the dollar
was persisting and was linked to the currency's interest rate
differential against other currencies, as well as the slowdown in
the U.S. economy.
   ``People have gotten tired of the dollar and dollar-based
securities,'' she said.
   Gold in London was quoted at $371.10 at the morning fixing, up
from $367.25 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $371.00, up from
$367.50 bid late Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.56 an ounce on Tuesday, to close at
$369.42.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.84 a

<HEAD>Soviet Armenia Defies Gorbachev Disarmament Decree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in Soviet Armenia say the republic is
capable of policing itself and will not abide by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's order that armed groups turn in their weapons and
disband, a local activist said.
   Last Wednesday's decree was Gorbachev's latest attempt to stem
more than two years of ethnic unrest in the southern Caucasus and
Central Asian republics. The disturbances have claimed more than
400 lives, caused millions of dollars' damage and produced
thousands of refugees.
   The Armenian parliament decided Monday that the Gorbachev decree
``contradicts the Armenian people's natural right to self-defense''
as outlined in Armenia's Constitution, as well as the U.N. Charter,
said Ovanes Muradian, a spokesman for the Armenian National
Movement.
   Soviet television said late Monday that the decree was being
ignored, with few weapons seized and armed attacks continuing in
Armenia.
   Soviet Interior Minister Vadim A. Bakatin said last week that
military force would be used if the decree was disobeyed, but
acknowledged problems could arise in implementing it without the
republics' full cooperation.
   Muradian said Armenia's parliament voted to suspend Gorbachev's
decree on the territory of Armenia and in the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region, and that it also declared Armenia could
police itself without ``outside interference.''
   But the lawmakers said they were willing to negotiate with
Gorbachev on the issue, Muradian added. The activist, speaking by
telephone from Armenia's capital of Yerevan, gave no vote total for
the resolution.
   Gorbachev's decree gave illegally armed militants 15 days to
turn in their weapons or risk having them confiscated. It
encompassed all groups that threatened lives, seized arms,
assaulted soldiers or police, or attacked military or civilian
facilities.
   Since June 4, battles between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks over
land distribution have killed at least 212 people.
   Bakatin said that besides Armenia, illegally armed groups
operate in Moldavia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia.
   The leadership of Georgia on Monday appealed to the public for
order, citing an increase in lawlessness and activity by armed
groups.
   Bakatin estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Armenians were involved in
illegally armed groups, but said others put the figure at 40,000 to
as many as 100,000.
   He said Interior Ministry troops would be sent to republics
requesting them, and army troops could go in if a state of
emergency were declared.
   Interior Ministry soldiers already patrol the Armenia-Azerbaijan
border. At least 200 people have been killed, mostly over who
should govern Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave inside
Azerbaijan.

<HEAD>Third World Spread Raises Estimate of Infection by 2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization today raised its
estimate of the number of people infected with the deadly AIDS
virus to at least 8 million, citing the disease's spread in Asia
and black Africa.
   The latest estimate of 8 to 10 million infections worldwide is 2
million above the previous figure but within a range the agency has
cited for some time.
   Particularly in Asia, the virus has been spreading much more
quickly than expected, WHO said.
   The ``toll of HIV infection around the globe is worsening
rapidly, especially in developing countries,'' Dr. Michael Merson,
head of WHO's anti-AIDS program, was quoted as saying in a
statement issued by the agency. HIV is the AIDS virus.
   In summarizing regional developments, the statement said the
rate of new HIV infections generally was slowing in the developed
world. But Merson warned against complacency, since the spread is
still quickening in some industrialized countries. WHO didn't
identify those countries.
   The agency said that in sub-Saharan Africa the estimate of
HIV-infected people had doubled to 5 million from 2.5 million in
1987. Due to the disease's spread in rural areas, WHO said 1 in 40
adult men and women are now believed to be virus carriers compared
with 1 in 50 estimated earlier.
   In Asia, the virus has spread rapidly among intravenous drug
users and female prostitutes. At least half a million Asians are
believed infected in an area where AIDS was virtually unknown two
years ago.
   WHO said the virus' spread in Asia, Latin America and
sub-Saharan Africa could force a ``dramatic upward revision'' of
its prediction that 15 to 20 million infections will have occurred
by the year 2000.
   The U.N. agency also said AIDS will kill at least 3 million
women and children worldwide in the 1990s due to rising
heterosexual transmission, six times more than in the 1980s.
   WHO has long said 5 to 10 million people worldwide are believed
infected with HIV but has recently narrowed its estimates.
   Its previous figure, issued last spring, was 6 million to 8
million.
   The virus is transmitted through blood and other body fluids.
   Infection with the virus is different from developing AIDS
itself, which destroys the body's immune system. There is no known
cure.
   WHO lists more than 260,000 reported AIDS cases worldwide but
says the actual total is two to three times higher.

<HEAD>Angry Farmers Burn Seven Tons Of Irish, German Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of cattle and sheep farmers broke into a
slaughterhouse and burned seven tons of imported German and Irish
meat to protest foreign competition, police said today.
   The incident occurred Monday night in the Maine-et-Loire region
of western France, two days after farmers in the area poisoned 94
sheep imported from Britain.
   Police said a group of farmers stopped a meat truck Monday
morning that was empty of cargo but carried documents indicating
meat had been delivered to a slaughterhouse in the town of
Fosse-en-Tigne.
   In the evening, about 100 men entered the slaughterhouse and set
fire to seven tons of meat in a cold storage room, police said. No
estimate of the damage was given.
   The attack Saturday occurred at a farm in Deux-Sevres, where 206
British sheep purchased by a French cooperative arrived Friday for
fattening before going to slaughter.
   The farm owner, Joseph Drouet, heard noises in his sheep pens
and found 94 of the animals dead, police said. They apparently had
ingested an insecticide.
   A caller claiming to represent local sheep farmers later
telephoned media organizations to claim the attack in the name of
Deux-Sevres herders.
   Sheep herders in the region have protested falling prices for
months. They blocked the route of the Tour de France bicycle race
July 2 and forced the riders to detour.
   Major farming organizations condemned the poisoning, but said
sheep herders were suffering from the loss of income.
   ``It's absolutely necessary to give them some hope,'' said
Raymond Lacombe, president of the National Federation of
Agriculture Unions.
   The government approved $11.3 million in aid last week to sheep
herders to help them weather the poor market.

<HEAD>Bertha as `Minimal' Hurricane Gains on Canada's Maritime Provinces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Canada issued a heavy rainfall
and wind warning for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island today as
Hurricane Bertha continued its steady pace over the open Atlantic.
   Forecasters said the minimal hurricane could reach the Canadian
provinces by Wednesday, but some effects would be felt today
because hurricane-force winds extended 70 miles from the center and
tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph reached outward up to
350 miles.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Bertha was centered near latitude 38.3
north, longitude 66.0 west, said forecasters at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. The hurricane was thus
centered some 775 miles due east of Washington, D.C., or 450 miles
south-southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
   It was moving north-northeast at 13 mph and had top sustained
winds of 75 mph.
   Bertha, the first hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic season, was
expected to stay at the same strength, course and speed through
early Wednesday, said forecaster Hal Gerrish.
   Bertha had been downgraded Sunday night to a tropical storm
after it temporarily weakened, regained enough strength to push it
just over the hurricane threshold of 74 mph.
   Earlier, Bertha kicked up the surf along Carolina beaches and
sent gusts up to about 45 mph toward Bermuda. But it has spent much
of its life in the open Atlantic after forming as a tropical
depression off northeast Florida, and was never much of a threat.

<HEAD>Reports: Israeli Involvement in Lebanon Fighting, 10 Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today that Israeli tanks
fired on battling Shiite Moslem militiamen in south Lebanon,
killing at least 10 guerrillas and wounding 15.
   An army spokesman refused to confirm or deny the report, but
Defense Minister Moshe Arens warned that Israel would take a role
in the fighting if the battles threatened Israeli interests.
   The daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported that Israeli tanks
opened fire Monday on the village of Jarjou, a site of rival Shiite
militia fighting just beyond Israel's self-proclaimed security zone
in south Lebanon.
   At least 10 fighters of the rival Hezbollah and Amal militias
were killed in the shelling and about 15 were wounded, the
newspaper said. It did not cite sources for the report.
   In a statement published in Beirut today, Hezbollah also
reported Israeli fire aimed at militia fighters Monday. It said
three of its fighters were killed and two wounded. The firing came
from an outpost of Israeli-backed militiamen, about a half-mile
from Jarjou, the statement said.
   Both protagonists in the Lebanese dispute are enemies of Israel
dating to the Jewish state's three-year occupation of south
Lebanon, which began with a June 1982 invasion to drive out
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas.
   Israel carved out a 6- to 10-mile-wide ``security zone'' along
the Lebanese border after it withdrew the bulk of its soldiers. The
zone is intended to prevent guerrilla raids across the border.
   The fighting between Hezbollah and Amal erupted July 16, the
latest stage in an intermittent 3-year-old battle to gain mastery
over Lebanon's Shiite community. Some 186 people have been killed
in these artillery battles and 560 wounded, by Lebanese police
count.
   Much of the latest combat has occurred on the rim of the Israeli
security zone.
   Arens told Israel radio ``there is a danger that the situation
will get worse and endanger our interests.''
   Earlier, Arens told Yediot Ahronot: ``If the combat reaches a
point in which we see that our interests are endangered ... in
other words when the situation becomes intolerable from our
standpoint _ there will be no choice and we will get involved.''
   A source in south Lebanon, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Israelis appeared to be warning the militiamen to steer
clear of the border rather than signaling intentions to intervene.

   The cheers started behind the third-base box
seats and grew louder as the news spread through the stands.
Finally, it erupted into a 90-second standing ovation at Yankee
Stadium.
   George Steinbrenner was out!
   ``The guy got exactly what he deserved,'' Trevor Bickford of
Westbury, N.Y., said Monday night. ``That's what should happen to
any owner that constantly makes decisions to hurt the club.''
   In the dugout, the Yankees weren't so happy.
   ``The fans may have been cheering, but I wasn't,'' pitcher Dave
Righetti said. ``It's sad. He really loved the idea of owning the
Yankees, and now it's been taken away from him. It'll certainly be
different not having him around here.''
   Word that Steinbrenner had been busted by Commissioner Fay
Vincent for dealing with a gambler came in the fourth inning as
fans listening with portable radios quickly spread the news
throughout the crowd.
   After the standing ovation, Detroit first baseman Cecil Fielder
quieted the crowd with his major league-leading 33rd homer,
accounting for the Tigers' only runs in a 6-2 loss to the Yankees
before a crowd of 24,037.
   ``I actually thought people were running on the field from the
third-base line, the noise was so loud,'' Yankees pitcher Dave
LaPoint said.
   ``People were actually mean about the situation, and I guess
venting their own frustrations,'' he said. ``It's a shame that the
fans who were out there erupted and made a joke out of it. It upset
a lot of us. The man was always generous to the players.''
   Many fans, however, did not like the way Steinbrenner treated
them. The man had hired and fired managers and criticized his own
team in his 18 years at the helm.
   ``I've been a Yankee fan since I was a little kid and it really
hurt me to see this team turned into a joke,'' said Frank Fedak of
Monroe, Conn. ``He's ruined the morale of the team and the morale
of the fans. I'm ready for a new owner.''
   ``He's worse than Pete Rose. Pete Rose was only a manager,''
said Lori Waller of Farmingville, N.Y. ``Steinbrenner was an owner
and should have taken his responsibility much more seriously.''
   But John Rizzi, a fan from Rockland, N.Y., said of
Steinbrenner's ouster: ``I don't feel this is right.''
   ``We were dead for 10 years and he made us a winner again,'' he
said. ``The next owner might not care at all or even take this club
to Jersey.''

<HEAD>Kollek Suspends Deputy Mayor Over Ad On Jailed Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Teddy Kollek has suspended his left-wing
deputy for signing an ad supporting reserve soldiers who refused to
serve in the occupied territories.
   ``I see the incident as ... a matter for harsh condemnation.
There are few points deserving of national consensus that should be
accepted by all of us and one of these is army service,'' Kollek
said in a letter to Deputy Mayor Ornan Yekutieli, published today
in the daily Haaretz newspaper.
   The ad, published in Haaretz last week, ``expressed respect for
the courageous step'' of four reserve soldiers who served jail
sentences for refusing to serve in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   More than 100 reservists have served jail terms for refusing to
serve in the occupied lands since the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation began in December 1987.
   Kollek's spokeswoman, Bonnie Boxer, said the mayor, a member of
the center-left Labor Party, suspended Yekutieli on Monday and
``asked him to refrain from representing the municipality until
there is further discussion of the subject.''
   The ad was signed by 43 members of the left-wing Citizens'
Rights Movement, to which Yekutieli belongs. It was later denounced
by the party's leadership.
   Haaretz quoted Yekutiel as saying the ad was a show of support
for a party member who served a jail sentence for refusing to serve
in the territories and did not advocate refusing to serve in the
military.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A letter bearing the name of West
Germany's most notorious terror gang today threatened more attacks
following an assassination attempt last week on a government
official.
   The letter, delivered to news agencies in Bonn and Frankfurt,
said the attack Friday on Interior Ministry official Hans Neusel
was the ``start of a long fighting phase against the newly arisen
Greater German-West European World Power.''
   At the bottom of the five-page letter, written in German, was
the name ``Red Army Faction.'' The group claimed responsibility for
the attack on Neusel in a letter left at the scene of the crime.
   The note received today was dated Sunday. The gang's symbol, a
star superimposed by an assault rifle, was missing. The group has
often used the symbol on written claims of responsibility.
   However, the federal prosecutor's office said the letter
appeared to be authentic. Spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster noted
that a similar letter was sent to news agencies several days after
the assassination of Deutsche Bank President Alfred Herrhausen, who
died in a November 1989 car bombing similar to the attack on Neusel.
   Neusel walked away with minor cuts after a bomb rocked his sedan
as he was driving to work.
   Today's message said the bomb was meant to ``accomplish his
certain death'' but that ``we calculated the amount of explosives
too low.''
   It also denounced the process of German unity as imperialistic.
The letter vowed support for leftist terrorists in Spain, and
called for the ``new building of a strong revolutionary movement''
across Western Europe.

<HEAD>Ukraine Says Its Soldiers Should Serve at Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Defense Ministry said today that a
Ukrainian resolution to keep its army conscripts from serving
outside the republic could impair the Soviet Union's ability to
defend itself.
   The republic's parliament on Monday adopted a resolution
declaring that Ukrainians drafted into the Soviet army should not
be used to quell ethnic violence in other parts of the country,
such as Armenia and Kirghizia.
   Lawmakers of the country's second most populous republic
addressed the resolution to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and
expressed the view that Ukrainian conscripts should only serve in
the republic, the Interfax news agency said.
   The resolution also said that Ukraininan troops attached to the
republic's Interior Ministry should not be used to put down ethnic
clashes in other republics.
   ``They appealed to the Supreme Soviets of Azerbaijan, Armenia,
Kirghizia and Uzbekistan to provide law and order on their
territories themselves,'' Interfax reported from Kiev.
   Asked to comment on the resolution, Defense Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Nikanorov said, ``our approach to forming armed forces of
the U.S.S.R. is that they must be a socialist, multinational,
exterritorial, and professional army.''
   ``From a military point of view, it is a step backward, it can
lead to the ruining of the army's capabilities and impair the
country's defense,'' he said.
   Furthermore, ``economically and technically, it is not really
feasible. Politically, it can lead to transferring interethnic
differences into military conflicts,'' he said.
   The Ukrainian parliament on July 16 declared that its laws take
precedence over national law. The declaration said the republic had
the right to set up its own armed force, currency, citizenship and
banking system.
   The declaration said the republic's youth cannot perform
military service outside the republic without the parliament's
permission.
   The Ukrainian decree followed other republics, such as Russia
and the three Baltic states, clamoring for more independence from
central authority.

<HEAD>Specialists Had Concerns About Potential Explosions in Hanford
Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety specialists had concerns about
potential explosions in storage tanks at the Hanford atomic weapons
plant since the 1970s, but authorities didn't acknowledge the
problem until recently, an internal investigation revealed today.
   Concern about possible explosions because of hydrogen
accumulation in some of the atomic waste tanks at the weapons plant
in eastern Washington state surfaced last March when the Energy
Department made the information public.
   But a report by the department's Office of Nuclear Safety
concluded that a string of plant operators dating back 13 years
were aware that flammable gas was being generated in the tanks and
``the significance ... was known as early as the late 1970s.''
   Meanwhile, a safety advisory panel to Energy Secretary James
Watkins suggested the department may not be taking the concern
about the tanks seriously enough.
   ``The technical basis for the analysis from which the (Hanford)
operator draws comfort about the safety of the tanks is weak,
considering the potential consequences of an accident,'' the
department's Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety said in
a letter to Watkins.
   The findings were released today by the Senate Government
Affairs Committee at hearings into the safety concerns over the
storage tanks at Hanford and other weapons facilities.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, committee chairman, said the panel
wants to examine what threat the tanks pose to workers at the
weapons plants and to nearby populations. The committee has
estimated a single tank could explode with the force of 36 tons of
TNT and release significant radiation.
   The Hanford weapons facility has 177 nuclear waste storage tanks
which contain highly radioactive byproducts from more than 40 years
of plutonium production. Last March, the Energy Department said
some of the double-walled tanks could explode because of a buildup
of highly flammable hydrogen.
   While acknowledging a problem, the department repeatedly has
said the likelihood is low of an explosion that would penetrate
both walls of any of the tanks is low.
   But in the letter to Watkins, John Ahearne, chairman of the
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety, suggested the
potential for danger is underestimated.
   ``The waste tanks are a serious problem. The possibility of an
explosion of an unstable chemical or a flammable gas must be taken
seriously'' because of the amount of radioactive materials that
could be released, Ahearne wrote.
   ``Top management of DOE and the contractor is paying more
attention to maximizing waste storage capacity and to minimizing
potential leakage from the tanks than to achieving higher levels of
tank safety,'' he continued.
   Ahearne said there is an ``urgent need to determine what is in
the tanks, what are the risks and what actions should be taken to
ameliorate the hazards. ... The operators have only sketchy
information on conditions ins the tanks.''
   In Olympia, Wash., meanwhile, Gov. Booth Gardner said ``there
appears to be no immediate danger to public health and safety''
from a cyanide compound that is in many of the tanks. There had
been concern last year that the compound may unleash a chemical
reaction that would lead to an explosion.
   Concern about the cyanide issue prompted the later disclosure
about the hydrogen buildup in the tanks. Since then the hydrogen
problem has gained most of the focus and is considered the more
troublesome.

<HEAD>Probe Asked into Treatment of Former Contra Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of Congress today asked for an
investigation into alleged neglect of former Contra rebels and
their families who remain in jungle camps along the Honduran border.
   Humanitarian aid for the U.S.-backed rebels, which had been
provided by the Agency for International Development, has been made
the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and
Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said the recent effort has been a failure
and that many of the rebels now face starvation. The leftist
Sandinista government which they had been fighting was replaced in
elections this year by a U.S.-backed political coalition.
   ``We put guns in their hands, but now we can't put food in their
mouths,'' Reid told a news conference.
   The three lawmakers called for an investigation by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, into why
adequate aid is not being provided.
   A State Department official, speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said the U.S. government believes that the rebels are
being adequately cared for and denied that the United States had
broken faith with the Contras.
   An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 rebels and family members remain
in the jungle camps, the lawmakers said, many of them with war
injuries. Infant mortality is high, they said.
   A supplemental money bill passed earlier this year included $35
million for continued humanitarian aid to the rebels as well as for
repatriation of the fighters. The lawmakers alleged that people are
being starved in the camps to force them back into Nicaragua, but
only about 1,000 a month are being moved, they said.

   Joan Ganz Cooney, who helped create the company
that produced ``Sesame Street'' and other educational series, will
step down as chief executive this fall, the Children's Television
Workshop announced.
   Mrs. Cooney, who will become chairman of the executive committee
of the company's board of trustees, will be succeeded by David
Britt, who currently is president and chief operating officer.
   ``This seems to me the right moment in CTW's life and my own to
make a change,'' Mrs. Cooney, 60, said Monday. ``I look forward to
continuing to work with David and all of the other talented people
at CTW.''
   In 1966, Mrs. Cooney undertook the feasibility and planning
study for the Carnegie Corporation which led to the creation of
``Sesame Street.'' She was elected president and chief executive
officer when the company was incorporated as a nonprofit
organization in 1970. She was elected chairman-CEO in 1988.
   Britt, 53, joined the company in 1971, following government
service in Washington. In 1974 he became assistant to the
president, and in 1988 he was named president and chief operating
officer.

<HEAD>Mohawk Leader Warns of ``Bloodbath,'' Calls for U.N. Observers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of Canada's Mohawks warned today that his
group's land dispute with the government could ``produce a
bloodbath'' and urged the United Nations to sent observers to
monitor the situation.
   Kenneth Deer also told a U.N. human rights panel that the
Mohawks have little confidence in Canadian authorities and their
ability to control police in the standoff.
   ``There is always the possibility of a provocation or an
accident which will produce a bloodbath between the two opposing
forces,'' Deer said.
   He also appealed to the panel to recommend that an international
delegation is sent to Canada to observe the situation and monitor
any negotiations. ``We have confidence in the justice of our
cause,'' Deer said, ``We have no qualms with an international
observation team.''
   His statements drew rare applause from the almost 300
representatives of various non-governmental organizations attending
the meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission's Working Group on
Indigenous Populations.
   Three weeks ago, police stormed a barricade manned by armed
Mohawks at Oka, a village 18 miles west of Montreal. The Mohawks
were protesting the proposed expansion of a golf course onto land
they claim is ancestral.
   A provincial police officer was killed in the shootout, but it
is unclear which side fired the fatal bullet. The government has
said the bullet's caliber did not match that assigned to provincial
police.
   Since the confrontation, police and Mohawk warriors have been
manning opposing barricades.
   Police have also blockaded the entrances to Oka, and Deer said
the police were limiting the amount of food that could be brought
into the area.
   ``We are a peaceful people who have shared our lands but the
pressure brought upon us at this point is unbearable,'' he said.
   He referred to Canada's treatment of its native population as
``the roots of the system of apartheid.''
   ``It is for each of us to give respect and dignity to each other
equally. Only then can the weapons of war be buried forever,'' he
said.
   Canadian ambassador Gerald E. Shannon told the panel Monday that
the federal government hopes that its purchase of the disputed land
will lead to an early end to the standoff.
   Shannon said the federal government expects to conclude the
purchase of the 67-acre plot this week for use by the Mohawks of
the Kanesatake reserve.
   Deer said the federal purchase plan ``validates the action of
the Mohawk people to defend their territory.'' But later he said
that ``the incident at Oka is no longer about land. It is to break
the spirit of the Mohawk people.''
   ``But the Mohawk people will never surrender, never give up our
land, our culture, our language,'' he said. ``It is our destiny
perhaps to struggle forever.''

   Two men were charged today with
planting a half-ton bomb that killed three police officers and a
Roman Catholic nun.
   Henry McCartney, 26, and Tarlac Connolly, 29, both of Armagh,
made no statement during their brief court appearance. They were
remanded in custody until Aug. 17.
   A third man questioned in the case was released Monday, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   Three officers of the Constabulary _ the police force of the
Protestant-dominated British province _ died instantly when an
estimated half-ton of explosives were detonated as they drove along
a rural highway on June 24.
   The nun, Sister Catherine Dunne, was in an oncoming car, and
died at a hospital shortly after the blast. A 25-year-old social
worker who was a passenger in her car, Cathy McCann, was injured.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the attack but said the nun's
death was an unintended ``fluke.''
   A detective told the court the two men had made no statement
since they were arrested Wednesday. He said the case was based on
forensic and circumstantial evidence.
   Sister Catherine was the first Roman Catholic nun killed in 21
years of violence in Northern Ireland. At least 2,800 people have
been killed in the fighting, including 273 full-time or reserve
police officers.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and to unite the privince with the Republic of
Ireland under a leftist administration.

<TEXT>
   The Comanche Peak nuclear power plant
has experienced its third ``unusual event'' in four months with the
release of non-radioactive steam into the atmosphere, utility
officials said.
   Steam was released late Monday from the only operable reactor in
the twin-reactor plant when a steam relief valve apparently
malfunctioned and opened too wide, said Mark Manroe, spokesman for
TU Electric.
   An ``unusual event'' is the lowest of four categories of
emergencies defined by regulators.
   There never was a threat to the public, Manroe said.
   The reactor had not been in operation since Thursday, when it
was shut down as part of the final test of its initial startup
testing program, Manroe said.
   The $9.1 billion plant about 45 miles southwest of Fort Worth
began generating power April 4 after a 10-year licensing battle.
   The plant had been scheduled to go to full power this week, but
Monday's event may alter that timetable, Manroe said.
   ``We're not going to be in a hurry to (startup) now until we
understand what happened this time,'' he said.

   Sales of new homes jumped 8 percent in June to
their highest level in four months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said new home sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 581,000 units in June after gaining a
revised 2.3 percent in May. The June figure was the highest level
since February, when sales totaled 606,000 at an annual rate.
   The May increase was even stronger than the 0.4 percent advance
first reported last month. Before the May increase, new home sales
had dropped for five straight months.
   At the same time, inventories of new homes fell to a 7.5-month
backlog at the June sales pace. That was down from 8.2 months in
May and 8.4 months in April.
   The increased sales and lower inventories could stimulate
renewed construction in an industry that analysts have said was
slowed by high interest rates, consumer caution because of adverse
economic news and a glutted market.
   The national commitment rate for 30-year, conventional
fixed-rate mortgages ranged from 10.29 percent to 10.10 percent in
June, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
The rate had dropped to 9.98 percent by last Friday.
   The National Association of Realtors reported last week that
sales of existing homes rose 1.2 percent in June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.34 million units. It was the first
increase since a 3.2 percent gain in November.
   The Realtors reported today that its index measuring the ability
of the typical family to purchase a median-priced existing home was
102.9 in June, down from 104.7 in May.
   That means a family earning the national median income of
$34,250 in June had 102.9 percent of the income needed to qualify
for conventional financing covering 80 percent of a median-priced
home costing $97,500.
   The median income means that half of the families earned more
and half less, while the median price means half of the homes cost
more and half less.
   In its report, the Commerce Department said the median price of
a new home rose 1.6 percent to $129,900, while the average price
advanced 2.1 percent to $152,900.
   Sales in the Northeast, which have been sluggish for more than a
year, jumped 36 percent to an annual rate of 102,000 units. Sales
in the South also advanced, up 13.6 percent to an annual rate of
243,000 units.
   Elsewhere, sales dropped. They were down 5.8 percent to an
annual rate of 146,000 units in the West and down 4.3 percent to an
annual rate of 90,000 units in the Midwest.
   For the first six months of 1990, new home sales have fallen 9.7
percent below sales of the first half of 1989 when they totaled
340,000 units.

   A cargo freighter left Colombo today
to evacuate about 100 British and other nationals trapped in the
rebel-held city of Jaffna, officials said.
   Military officials also said that at least 54 people have died
in two days of fighting across the island nation.
   The ``Lanka Siri'' sailed for Point Pedro, the northernmost tip
of the Jaffna Peninsula. Rebels have controlled the peninsula since
the latest round in the 7-year-old civil war broke out June 11,
military officials said. The freighter was expected to return
Wednesday.
   Point Pedro is 12 miles north of Jaffna, headquarters of the
rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The militia has been locked
in fierce battles with government troops for control of the north
and east.
   Most of those to be evacuated were Tamil expatriates visiting
their homeland when the fighting started, the officials said. About
90 are British citizens and one is a Swiss national, the officials
said.
   The nationalities of the others were not known and other details
were unavailable, they said. Communications with Jaffna have been
cut since the fighting broke out, and the only reports from the
area have come from military officials in the capital.
   The evacuation was being supervised by the Red Cross, the
officials said. Red Cross officials in Colombo and New Delhi,
India, could not immediately be reached for comment.
   Meanwhile, in a battle today in northwestern Mannar, at least
seven rebels and five soldiers were killed, the officials said.
   Elsewhere, gunmen killed 20 Tamil civilians in the northeastern
village of Kantalai, military officials and residents said. It was
not immediately clear who the assailants in Monday night's attack
were.
   Earlier today, the officials said 14 Moslems were killed by the
rebels in the Ampara district, south of Trincomalee.
   Moslems, who make up about 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, are often caught in the middle of the civil war between the
minority Tamils and Sinhalese-dominated government. The rebels
accuse them of siding with the army.
   In Jaffna, at least six rebels and two policemen were killed,
military officials said.
   The deaths raise to more than 3,000 the number of combatants
killed in the fighting. The outbreak of fighting in June ended a
13-month cease-fire that had interrupted the war for an independent
Tamil homeland.
   Tamils say they are discriminated by the majority Sinhalese in
jobs and education. Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people and the Sinhalese, who control the government and
the military, comprise 75 percent.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in the Tamil revolt
since it began in 1983.

   Poland says a Soviet secret policeman who
signed the order for the World War II massacre of Polish officers
in the Katyn forest is still alive and should be interrogated, the
PAP news agency reported today.
   Poland's Justice Ministry alleged that Pyotr Karpovich
Soprunenko was a major in the NKVD, the precursor to the KGB, when
he signed the list of 4,200 officers ordered to be executed at
Katyn in the spring of 1940, PAP said.
   The ministry, in a communique Monday, said Soprunenko is living
in Moscow, PAP reported.
   Justice Minister Aleksander Bentkowski of Poland has asked
Soviet General Public Prosecutor Aleksander Sukhorev to interrogate
Soprunenko in the presence of a Polish investigator, PAP said.
   In all, 15,000 Polish officers, the cream of Polish society
called up from the reserves, were murdered after being interned at
three camps when the Red Army occupied eastern Poland in 1939.
   For decades, successive Soviet governments maintained the
massacre was committed by the Nazis. Only in April did authorities
acknowledge, as Polish and Western historians had long contended,
that the slaughter was by the NKVD at Stalin's behest.
   A mass grave in the Katyn forest near Smolensk was discovered in
1943. It contained the remains of more than 4,200 soldiers, and the
remains of the others have not been found.
   In June, the KGB identified a park outside the Ukranian city of
Kharkov as the likely burial place for 3,900 Polish soldiers.
Investigators have suggested that the others were buried in mass
graves north of Kalinin.
   Ukrainian officials have granted the Polish government the right
to participate in the Kharkov exhumations, planned for September.

   The man who saved a Detroit Zoo
chimpanzee from drowning said he never feared for his own life as
he wrestled the 135-pound primate.
   ``He was looking at me,'' said Rick Swope, a 33-year-old truck
driver from Cement City. ``I think he knew that I was helping
him,'' so Swope said he wasn't afraid.
   Swope was visiting the zoo Sunday with his wife, Cynthia, and
their three children.
   ``We watched the chimpanzees for probably about half an hour or
so and we were just getting ready to go when I heard a splash,'' he
said. ``I just caught out of the corner of my eye this chimpanzee
flying through the air.''
   ``Everyone in the whole place was just standing around watching
this monkey drown,'' Swope said Monday. ``When he went down the
second time I knew I had to do something.''
   Swope scaled the 4-foot fence and plunged into the cold, murky
water. He reached the chimpanzee and pulled it back to the island.
   ``He was pretty lifeless,'' Swope said. ``When I brought him out
of there I wasn't sure he was still alive.''
   Zoo officials are unsure why the 18-year-old, 135-pound male
chimpanzee jumped into the moat surrounding its 1-acre island home,
said spokeswoman Pat Butkiewicz. Chimpanzees cannot swim and
generally are afraid of water.
   In April, a week after the $7.5 million exhibit opened, a
20-year-old female chimp drowned in the 5-foot-deep moat.
   Zoo director Steve Graham said the exhibit would be partially
closed while the design of the moat was being re-evaluated.
   Graham said Swope's rescue was brave but reckless, because
chimps are three to five times stronger than humans. A zoo employee
was trying to use a pole to save the chimp when Swope jumped in the
water, officials said.
   Swope, who doesn't have any lifeguard or veterinary training,
said he kept one arm around the chimp's stomach during the rescue.
   ``I thought maybe I could pump some water out of him,'' he said.
``When he got his strength back, I let him go.''
   Swope's family each year visits the suburban Detroit zoo about
75 miles northwest of their home. He said chimpanzee exhibit is one
of his children's favorites.
   ``They're happy it turned out the way it did, too. They're glad
I went in and got him,'' he said. ``They wouldn't expect anything
less from their dad.''

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Groups Call 1976 Court Brief `Profoundly Alarming'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS with new Souter comment, picks up 6th graf pvs, In an

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter returned
to Capitol Hill today for private meetings with senators and
sidestepped questions about news coverage seeking to discern his
views on abortion.
   ``There's nothing I'd wish to say,'' Souter replied when asked
if he had any complaint about the media coverage. ``That's not an
endorsement,'' he added.
   He was questioned as abortion rights advocates were calling
``profoundly alarming'' what they say is the latest glimpse of
Souter's possible views on abortion.
   Asked whether he would be spending much time in briefings with
White House aides before his Senate Judiciary Committee
confirmation hearings begin Sept. 13, Souter said, ``I haven't
worked out a schedule.''
   Souter commented while posing for photographers before he met
privately with Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, one of the
committee's staunchest abortion foes.
   Souter was to pay a similar courtesy call to another
anti-abortion committee member, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
later in the day.
   Senators on both sides of the politically explosive issue say
abortion will be discussed during the confirmation hearings.
   The latest attempt to determine Souter's abortion views was made
by the liberal People for the American Way. The group, which
supports abortion rights, released copies Monday of a 1976 brief in
which the New Hampshire attorney general's office headed by Souter
referred to abortion as ``the killing of unborn children.''
   In an earlier case, argued in 1972 when Souter was the state's
deputy attorney general, New Hampshire defended its strict
anti-abortion law against a constitutional challenge by arguing,
``The maintenance of an unborn child's right to birth is a
compelling interest which outweighs any rights of a mother to an
abortion except when necessary to preserve her life.''
   Richard V. Wiebusch, whose signature appears on the 1976 brief
as an assistant attorney general, said today that Souter wasn't
involved in the preparation of the case.
   ``I don't recall him looking at the language, talking to me
about the argument or approving any line of argument,'' said
Wiebusch, now a lawyer in private practice in Manchester, N.H.
   He said the brief did not represent anyone's personal view on
abortion but was the result of the obligation of the attorney
general's office to defend regulations adopted by a state social
services agency.
   ``I chose the language,'' Wiebusch said. ``It seemed to me to be
the best way at the time to make the case.'' He said he did not
know Souter's opinions on abortion.
   The U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in its 1973 decision
in Roe vs. Wade.
   ``The Senate should ask Judge Souter to address himself'' to the
1976 document, said Arthur Kropp, president of People for the
American Way. He said the language ``suggests a clear sympathy for
an anti-abortion viewpoint.''
   Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League
added, ``Judge Souter's use of rhetoric commonly used by
anti-choice extremists is profoundly alarming.''
   But Rebecca Hagelin of the anti-abortion Concerned Women for
America said the language used in the 1976 brief ``tells me
absolutely nothing about how he is going to rule if given an
opportunity to reassess Roe vs. Wade.''
   ``This is an attempt by the opposition to create a lot of
hoopla. Everyone seems to be grasping at straws,'' she said. ``As
someone who is passionately pro-life, I'd love to know his views on
this subject but it would be inappropriate to ask.''
   Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee called
the 1976 brief a ``very tenuous'' link to Souter and his personal
views. Johnson said Souter ``is likely to answer (Judiciary
Committee) questions in generalities and refuse to discuss specific
cases that will come before the court.''
   Abortion rights activists say such answers should be deemed
unacceptable.
   The 1976 brief submitted to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, the court on which Souter now serves, argued that New
Hampshire was under no legal obligation to spend Medicaid funds for
abortions.
   ``Many thousands of New Hampshire residents find the use of tax
revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally
repugnant,'' the brief contended.
   The nation's highest court in 1977 ruled that states have no
legal obligation to pay for non-therapeutic abortions sought by
women on welfare. The court in 1980 upheld a ban on federal
spending for most welfare abortions.
   Anti-abortion groups expressed dismay last week when it was
reported that Souter served on the board of a New Hampshire
hospital and attended a meeting when it voted to allow abortions at
the facility.

<HEAD>Fire Chases Campers In California; Lightning Sets Fires In

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   An 800-acre wildfire in southern California forced evacuation of
campgrounds and picnic sites, and hundreds of lightning strikes
started fires in the forests of Oregon, Washington and Idaho.
   About seven miles north of Santa Barbara, Calif., some 580
firefighters had surrounded about 50 percent of the 800-acre fire
in the Santa Ynez Valley by early today. Total containment was
expected by midday Wednesday, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman
Earl Clayton. The cause of the fire, which started Monday
afternoon, was unknown.
   No structures were threatened, but the blaze in brush and grass
forced about 30 people to evacuate campgrounds and picnic sites
Monday, said Forest Service spokesman Gary Self. A construction
crew also evacuated the Gibraltar Dam, he said.
   About 1,500 lightning strikes lit small fires between the
Willamette National Forest in west-central Oregon and the Wenatchee
National Forest in central Washington on Monday as storms traveled
along the crest of the Cascade Range.
   Elsewhere in Washington, near Kennewick, a range fire fanned by
35 mph wind blackened 1,200 acres Monday, and Interstate 82 was
closed after several smoke-related accidents, authorities said.
   More than 400 firefighters battled the Canoe Creek fire in a
steep canyon of scattered ponderosa pine and Douglas fir about 28
miles northwest of Chelan, Wash., in the Wenatchee National Forest,
spokesmen said.
   In Oregon, the 360-acre Wake Butte fire, burning six miles
southwest of Sunriver on the Deschutes National Forest, was 80
percent contained and was expected to be controlled by Wednesday
evening, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Ann Carlson.
   On the California-Nevada state line 10 miles north of Lake
Tahoe, a fire of undetermined size in steep terrain of the Sierra
Nevada sent an acrid pall of smoke over the Reno area, said Chuck
Witte, of the Nevada Division of Forestry.
   Traffic was congested on nearby Interstate 80 during the night
because of people slowing to watch the fire.
   Lightning started more than four dozen small fires during the
night in western and central Idaho. More than 100 firefighters were
scattered through the northern parts of the Boise and Payette
national forests today, and over 200 more were being sent in,
Forest Service officials said.

long illness, associates said today. He was 63.
   No details of his illness were immediately available. Associates
said Guy died Monday.
   A follower of numerous artistic disciplines, Guy served as
culture minister from 1974 to 1976 under Premier Jacques Chirac.
   He founded the Fall Festival in 1972 and served as its director
every year since except during his stint in the Cabinet. The arts
festival built a reputation for attracting avant-garde artists in
varied fields and from diverse ethnic backgrounds.
   Guy also served as vice president of the oversight council of
France's cultural television channel, La Sept, and on the
administrative council of the arts festival held each summer in
Avignon.
   There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral services.

   The Irish Republican Army today claimed
responsibility for killing lawmaker Ian Gow, a close friend of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and outspoken critic of the IRA.
   So long as Britain controls Northern Ireland, the IRA said in a
statement, ``the IRA will continue to strike whenever and wherever
the opportunity arises.''
   Gow, 53, a Conservative Party lawmaker, was killed Monday
morning when a bomb exploded under his car at his home in Hankham,
southeast England. The IRA claim was made in a statement to Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   Rodney Lind, assistant chief constable of the Sussex police,
told reporters today police were following up several leads based
on tips from the public. Police recovered some components of the
bomb, and checks were being made at ports in the belief the
guerrillas may have fled by ferry to the continent, he said.
   Dressed in black, Mrs. Thatcher attended a service in memory of
Gow on Monday night at the Anglican parish church in the village of
Hankham, 60 miles south of London, where Gow lived with his wife,
Jane.
   Gow was chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee in the House
of Commons. The committee discusses the affairs of the province,
where the IRA is fighting British rule, but has no power over
legislation.
   However, the IRA statement noted that Gow was a ``close personal
associate'' of Mrs. Thatcher. It also noted that he was Mrs.
Thatcher's personal parliamentary secretary, and thus one of her
closest advisers, during her first four years in power from 1979 to
1983.
   Gow was ``one of a small group of influential Tories ... who in
the late 1970s formulated the British policy pursued in Ireland
since the 1979 Tory election victory,'' the statement said.
   Gow was also a close friend of Airey Neave, the Conservative
Party spokesman on Northern Ireland who was killed by a car bomb in
1979. The Irish National Liberational Army, an IRA splinter group,
claimed responsibility for that attack.
   The Independent newspaper said today: ``The assassination of Ian
Gow may represent an attempt by the IRA to cause personal hurt to
Margaret Thatcher and goad her into overreacting to his death. ...
His symbolic importance lay in his close association with the prime
minister.''
   The Gow and Thatcher families were close and often spent
Christmas together.
   Looking somber and shaken, Mrs. Thatcher told reporters in
London before leaving for Hankham that the slaying would make no
difference to her Conservative government's fight against terrorism.
   Mrs. Thatcher attended the church service at Hankham with Mrs.
Gow, the widow's two sons ages 20 and 22, and friends of the
family. The group lit candles in Gow's memory.
   Jane Gow said in an interview with the Brighton Argus that her
husband's death ``will not diminish our resolve to be as strong as
he was in fighting this terrible wickedness.''
   ``We want to share Ian's great courage in defying evil and
terrorism,'' she said in the interview published today.
   Scotland Yard's chief anti-terrorist officer, George
Churchill-Coleman, said Gow had been warned he was on a list of 100
lawmakers, judges and civil servants found in an IRA bomb factory
in south London in December 1988.
   Gow resigned from Mrs. Thatcher's government in 1985 in protest
over the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed Nov. 15 of that year. The
accord gave the government of the Republic of Ireland, which is 95
percent Roman Catholic and lays constitutional claim to Northern
Ireland, a formal consultative role in the running of the province.
   Gow sided with the province's Protestant leaders in opposing the
accord, saying Northern Ireland should be governed like any other
part of Britain. But he remained a staunch supporter of other
government policies.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite the province with the
Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey joined British politicians
in condemning the attack, the fourth slaying of a member of
Parliament since sectarian and political fighting erupted in
Northern Ireland in 1969.
   The IRA has claimed responsiblity for a series of bombings in
England, including one May 16 that killed Sgt. Charles Chapman at a
army recruiting office.
   Other recent targets have included London's Stock Exchange, the
Carlton Club, a traditional Conservative Party watering hole, the
Stock exchange and a Royal Air Force base in northwest London.
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the killing and
offered condolences to Gow's family.
   Mrs. Thatcher narrowly escaped an IRA bombing that killed five
people at a hotel in Brighton during the Conservative Party's
annual conference in October 1984.

   The body of a man who had been charged with
burglary in the past was recovered from the ruins of one of eight
businesses destroyed in a weekend explosion that gutted a downtown
block.
   The victim, Jeffrey E. Johnson, 25, was discovered Monday by
investigators looking for clues to Saturday night's explosion, said
Agent Jerry Turpen of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   ``He was lying in the grass with the building on top of him,''
Turpen said.
   The explosion in this city of about 13,000 about 10 miles north
of the South Carolina border shattered storefront windows nearly
the length of Main Street. Six people were treated at a hospital
for cuts from flying glass, officials said. Public Safety Director
Bobby Kilgore estimated losses at $500,000 to $1 million.
   Officials had not expected to find any victims because no one
was reported missing after the explosion.
   ``We don't know what we have,'' Turpen said after the body was
discovered. ``Our process will be a lot slower now because of the
possibility that someone else could be in there.''
   Investigators said they did not know whether Johnson was caught
in the blast while walking by or was inside the building without
permission and was blown out. He had been scheduled to appear in
court next month on charges of breaking and entering, and he
received a two-year suspended sentence for possession of stolen
goods last December, authorities said.
   On Monday, about two dozen investigators from the State Bureau
of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
sifted through debris in the search for the cause of the blast.
   Authorities also were looking into bomb threats that were
recently phoned into several downtown locations. ``At this point we
know of no connection, but we do know that at least three bomb
threats were made,'' Turpen said.
   Mayor Lynn Keziah said Sunday that authorities suspected a gas
leak may have been the cause.

   Residents making do with flashlights and
city-supplied packages of food should have their electricity back
by tonight, three days after a major blackout on the West Side, a
utility spokesman said.
   Police said 230 extra officers patrolled the streets and
directed traffic overnight, but there appeared to be no recurrence
of the scattered looting that followed Saturday's blackout of
40,000 customers on the city's far West Side.
   By midmorning, only about 1,000 customers remained without
electricity, said Glen Wald, a Commonwealth Edison Co. spokesman.
   Earlier, another spokesman, Peter Guck, said: ``We're
anticipating having the whole episode cleaned up today. That's a
lot earlier than we thought it might be. We tried to be
conservative on the timing, but things went well.''
   City officials delivered 2,200 food boxes Monday and sent out
extra garbage trucks to haul away spoiled food residents cleaned
out of their refrigerators.
   ``Many people had their refrigerators stocked on Saturday and
lost a whole week's supply of groceries,'' said Alderman Jesus
Garcia. ``They're very disappointed and need some help.''
   The utility said it gave aldermen 2,600 flashlights and 1,500
packages of food that were distributed Monday night.
   The city's food boxes contained powered milk, baby formula,
canned goods and other non-perishable items. Commonwealth Edison
said it didn't want to duplicate the city's efforts so it sent out
food for the next couple of meals _ meat, bread, milk and baby food.
   The blackout occurred after a faulty transformer exploded,
sparking a fire that damaged a plant feeding electricity to a large
section of the West Side.
   Police said 49 people were arrested Saturday night and 30 Sunday
night during looting.
   Martin Martinez, co-owner of a grocery, said he lost about
$30,000 when his store was ransacked. Four people arrested were
regular customers, Martinez said.
   ``It makes me feel hurt, betrayed,'' he said.
   City inspectors fanned out through the area, condemning food at
groceries and meat markets that had spoiled because of no
refrigeration.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Noah Robinson of Embezzlement, Racketeering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's half brother was convicted on 51
counts of racketeering, tax evasion, fraud and other charges
related to a plot to skim $650,000 from six fast-food restaurants
he operated.
   Prosecutors said Noah Robinson and four associates told workers
at the Wendy's restaurants to turn off cash registers in the early
morning and use calculators to record sales. Those transactions
were never reported to government or corporate officials.
   Robinson denied ever cheating the Internal Revenue Service, the
state or Wendy's.
   ``It was my money,'' Robinson said. ``Why should I steal?''
   Also Monday, the jury convicted Noah Robinson's brother, John,
and acquitted an employee, Darrell Butler.
   No verdict was rendered in the cases of Noah Robinson's other
brother, George, and Noah's secretary and girlfriend, Alfreda
Vaughn. U.S. District Judge George Marovich told the jury to resume
deliberations today on those charges.
   The four were charged with 30 counts of racketeering, tax
evasion and fraud.
   A sixth defendant, a bookkeeper, pleaded guilty earlier to two
counts of wire fraud.
   Noah Robinson, who has been in jail since last year, could be
sentenced to a maximum 20 years in prison on the single
racketeering count. Each other count carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison.
   A sentencing date has not been set.
   Robinson also faces trial on separate federal racketeering
charges in connection with a street gang. Last year, he was
sentenced in South Carolina to 10 years in prison for aiding a
fugitive who had stabbed a witness to the slaying of an employee of
Robinson's.
   Robinson and Jackson, a Democratic candidate for president in
1984 and 1988, have the same father, but Jackson has described
their relationship as strained. Jackson was born to an unwed mother.

<HEAD>Governors Ending Conference with Charges of Blame Over S&amp;L Crisis</HEAD>

   The nation's governors were ending their
summer conference today hurling partisan charges of blame for the
savings and loan crisis.
   Democratic governors, meeting privately, approved a resolution
calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the widening
crisis, which is estimated to cost $300 billion or more in a
taxpayers bailout.
   A Republican ad in the Mobile Register blamed congressional
Democrats for the S&amp;L problems and provoked an angry response from
Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, chairman of the Democratic governors.
   He called the ad ``deceitful'' and ``the most outrageous
distortion of the truth.'' He blamed Republicans for upsetting the
normal spirit of bipartisanship at the governors' conference and
said the Bush administration has failed to lead on the S&amp;L crisis.
   ``I'm surprised this is in the Mobile paper while the National
Governors' Association is meeting,'' Celeste said.
   The ad pictured 12 congressional Democrats, including resigned
House Speaker Jim Wright. It was signed by the Republican National
Committee in Washington.
   It said, ``You won't see these Democratic `leaders' around
Mobile,'' and ``They're the guys who let the S&amp;L problem explode
into a $325 billion national crisis.''
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, in Mobile for the
meeting, said the ads were a sign of ``absolute panic'' by
Republicans over the S&amp;L debacle
   A Republican governor, John McKernen of Maine, said Democrats
have been trying to use the S&amp;L issue and ``Republicans want to
make sure people realize there's enough blame to go around.''
   The ad was an escalation in the growing partisan rancor over the
S&amp;L crisis as the fall elections approach. Another RNC ad ran a day
earlier.
   The ads apparently were provoked by a resolution pushed by
Democratic governors, and subject to vote by governors of both
parties, calling for a national commission to investigate the S&amp;L
scandal. The White House on Monday said it rejected that suggestion.
   The bipartisan National Governors' Association was adjourning
after a final session to consider resolutions to install Washington
state Gov. Booth Gardner, a Democrat, as the new chairman, and Gov.
John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican, as vice chairman.
   In party caucuses, Democrats elected Colorado's Roy Romer and
Mississippi's Ray Mabus chairman and vice chairman of their
Democratic Governors' Association
   Gardner said Monday he planned to shift the governors'
association's focus to health care problems _ including cost
containment and broader access to care for the poor _ during his
one-year term.
   ``The arena is moving toward the states,'' he said. ``Neither
the administration nor Congress wants to deal with it.''
   Governors in both parties voiced concern about the growing size
of the S&amp;L bailout, topping $300 billion by some estimates.
   But the policy statement of concern approved by the
association's executive committee _ and up for a vote today by the
full association _ drew quick rejection from the White House and a
Republican charge of partisanship.
   ``We do feel it is unnecessary to create another bureaucratic
body,'' Stephen Hart, a deputy White House press secretary, said in
Washington.
   ``We think the best thing to do is to work quickly on the
current caseload with the funds and the processes we now have in
place which are working,'' Hart said. ``We feel it's not time to
point fingers but it's time to get the money that's owed to the
depositors back in their hands.''
   The statement on S&amp;Ls asks Congress and the White House to
establish a national commission to investigate the crisis. It was
pushed by Virginia's Democratic Gov. Douglas Wilder, who said the
commission should find the failures behind the S&amp;L crisis and a way
to provide ``equitable recovery'' of taxpayers' money.
   Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina said
Democrats would find plenty of blame ``in their own back yard.''
   The governors also were voting on a new policy statement
recommending a national education commission.
   The panel _ including six governors, four members of Congress
and four administration officials _ would assess how states and the
federal government fare in meeting the governors' goals for
education reform.
   Governors in both parties were united in opposing an
administration plan, worked out with congressional Republicans, to
raise federal revenue by limiting the federal tax deduction for
state and local taxes.
   Democratic governors, led by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
planned to send Bush a letter strongly urging him to drop that
plan. They said it would encroach on state tax bases and penalize
the very states that raised taxes on upper-income people to pay for
services and balance their own budgets.

   A decrepit Soviet truck
lurches down the highway to Vietnam bearing clay-grimed wreckage of
a U.S. aircraft.
   The export of war scrap is an everyday scene in eastern Laos,
bringing cash to impoverished villagers. But widespread scavenging
of aircraft crash sites is hindering U.S. efforts to account for
Americans missing from the Indochina War.
   U.S. planes flew hundreds of thousands of bombing sorties
against Communist targets in Laos between 1965 and 1973 and some
never made it back to home base.
   Their crews make up most of the 533 U.S. servicemen still listed
as missing in action in the country.
   The United States began ground searches for the MIAs in 1983,
and Washington recently has issued upbeat statements telling of
improving cooperation with the Laotian government.
   But progress remains slow, partly because of the difficulty in
coordinating searches with understaffed Laotian ministries. So far,
just 36 sets of remains have been identified and repatriated.
   Vital evidence that would help identify crash sites is being
carted away for sale. And its not just aircraft scrap _ but human
remains, too.
   Still, Washington have faced fewer problems cooperating with the
government in Laos, the only Indochinese country with which it has
diplomatic relations, than in Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The first six sets of suspected MIA remains were returned from
Cambodia last week. A total of 1,678 Americans are missing in
Vietnam, 83 in Cambodia while six are missing over China's coastal
waters.
   In 1987, a group of private U.S. citizens and Republican
congressmen began distributing leaflets in Laos offering a $2.4
million reward for the return of any live American prisoner.
   The offer has done irreparable harm to search efforts, U.S.
officials say.
   They say they have been swamped by sightings of live ``missing''
Americans, mostly by Laotian refugees who want to resettle abroad.
More than 17,000 interviews have not yielded a single credible case.
   ``People figure that if someone is offering so much money for a
live American they are also willing to pay for bones,'' a U.S.
official said.
   Even though U.S. policy does not sanction financial rewards for
MIA remains, a slick cottage industry has grown up turning out
bones and bogus dog tag military identifications. These are offered
to U.S. searchers through middlemen in neighboring Thailand.
   ``Some people were even willing to dig up their mother's
grave,'' said one American expert who did not want to be identified.
   A genuine American skeleton might be split up into several sets
of remains in the hope of more rewards, and that reduces the
chances of identifying the remains, a U.S. official said.
   Provincial officials say they are willing to support fully U.S.
efforts to find their missing. But even they admit there is a
tradeoff.
   ``Many planes came down here. People know where they are,'' said
Lahoun Maprayvong, an district official in the heavily-bombed
southeastern province of Savannakhet.
   Washington must do more to rebuild what the bombing destroyed,
he said.
   ``It is according to the agreement. If they want to know where
the bones are, the local people need help,'' he said. ``We need
hospitals and schools.'' The United States gives some assistance to
the Laotian government in return for MIA cooperation. But in June,
Richard Solomon, Secretary of State for Asian affairs, admitted
that Washington had ``been unable to address (Laotians')
humanitarian concerns in a meaningful way.''
   Lahoun says some villagers are unwilling to reveal crash sites.
He says it's because they have bad memories of the bombing. But
there's money to be made from the gleaning of U.S. crash sites _
and that can make a difference in rural areas where annual per
capita income is below $170.
   Villagers and traders have systematically stripped many crash
sites of anything of value. This includes many key aircraft parts
bearing serial numbers that would help identify its crew.
   Aircraft aluminum is recycled into buckets, cooking pots,
spoons, traditional jewelry, even river canoes.
   Traders say the top-quality metal fetches high prices abroad. It
is trucked to Vietnam and Thailand, with some sent on to Japan and
beyond.
   But the trade is slowing down. One by one, crash sites are
denuded. Some sites have only a few fragments of metal and bone
left. Only in the most remote regions are there undisturbed sites,
U.S. officials say.
   They hope easing Cold War tensions and gradually improving
relations with communist Indochina will improve access and allow
more widespread searches.

<HEAD>Attorney: Pilot Accused of Flying Drunk Had High Tolerance For
Booze</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of three former Northwest Airlines pilots
accused of flying while intoxicated had a higher tolerance for
alcohol because he is an alcoholic, his lawyer said today.
   In an opening statement at the pilots' trial, attorney Peter
Wold said Capt. Norman Prouse has been an alcoholic for many years,
but he said Prouse performed flawlessly during a March 8 flight
from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis.
   ``Being an alcoholic does not mean you are under the influence
of alcohol all the time,'' Wold said. ``A person who consumes
alcohol builds up a tolerance.''
   Wold and William Mauzy, the attorney for 1st Officer Robert
Kirchner, said they would prove their clients were not impaired
during the early-morning flight by the alcohol they consumed the
previous night.
   Mauzy told the federal court jury to concentrate on the smooth
operation of the 91-passenger flight instead of on the pilots'
drinking the night before and the results of blood-alcohol tests
taken after the flight.
   Kirchner, of Highland Ranch, Colo., piloted the Boeing 727. The
plane, carrying 91 passengers, left as scheduled at 6:25 a.m., less
than seven hours after Kirchner, Prouse of Conyers, Ga., and flight
engineer Joseph Balzer of Antioch, Tenn., were seen drinking at a
lounge in Moorhead.
   Balzer's lawyer was to make an opening statement later in the
day.
   In her opening prosecution statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Elizabeth de la Vega said that there would be much evidence about
heavy drinking the night before the flight. She said witnesses will
testify that there was tension between the pilots and some bar
patrons that threatened to erupt into violence.
   De la Vega said blood-alcohol tests taken after the flight
showed that Prouse still had an equivalent of eight drinks in his
system while the plane was in the air and that Kirchner and Balzer
had the equivalent of three beers each still in their systems.
   ``All three defendants were in fact under the influence of
alcohol when they were operating Flight 650 that morning,'' she
said.
   A bar patron tipped the Federal Aviation Administration and
Northwest that the crew was ``quite intoxicated'' and might be
piloting an early-morning flight, according to court records.
   An FAA investigator has testified the pilots were late reporting
to the departure gate and that they smelled of alcohol. While he
was phoning for instructions on how to handle the situation, the
plane departed.
   When it arrived at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport, an FAA official made a citizen's arrest of the trio.
   U.S. District Court Judge James Rosenbaum has said the trial is
expected to last about two weeks.

<TEXT>
   A Norwegian man felled trees, hauled lumber
and built a road up a mountain in a race to finish his dream cabin
in time for summer vacation.
   He got it done at the right time, but in the wrong place.
   The Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang reported Tuesday that the man,
who was not identified, missed his own land by 330 feet and built
his cabin on a neighboring forest lot.
   ``I was astounded,'' Hallvard Oerjasaeter told the newspaper
after he discovered the cabin on his land. ``I thought maybe I had
the map turned upside down but no, it was my forest.''
   Oerjasaeter said the builder apologized profusely but ``that
doesn't help much. I didn't want a cabin on my property.''
   Verdens Gang said the cabin, near the central Norway town of
Oeyer, will remain empty until the builder moves it or persuades
Oerjasaeter to sell him the land.

   China's domestic postal rates were raised Tuesday
for the first time in 40 years, the official media reported.
   The announcement, carried in most of the official press, said
domestic postal rates have been raised 150 percent, from .85 cents
to 2 cents for a local delivery and from 1.7 cents to 4 cents for
inter-city letters.
   It said parcel post charges also were raised 150 percent.
   Overseas rates, which are much higher, were not mentioned in the
announcement.
   China's postal services have been running deficits since the
1970s because of the lack of adjustments in the rates, the
English-language China Daily said.

<HEAD>Gay Pravda Goes To Press For Soviet Homosexuals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Gays of the World Unite,'' says the
masthead of Gay Pravda, a newspaper which went to press in the
Netherlands this week for distribution among homosexuals in the
Soviet Union.
   The free, eight-page Russian-language publication contains news
on gay movements in the Netherlands and France and advice on how to
guard against AIDS by using a condom, said Henk Krol of Holland's
Gay Krant newspaper.
   Gay Pravda, which looks similar to the Soviet Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, is being published jointly by Gay Krant and the
French publication Gai Pied, Krol said Tuesday.
   Krol said 85,000 copies will be mailed to the Soviet Union, some
in large packages, others in letters addressed to individuals.
   Several gay Soviet soldiers stationed in East Germany have
offered to help distribute the journal, Krol said.
   Krol conceded that many copies are likely to be confiscated by
Soviet authorities.
   But he said the newspaper was a gesture of ``solidarity'' with
homosexuals in the Soviet Union, where homosexual relations carry a
maximum prison term of five-years.
   ``We hope this will contribute toward the setting up of a gay
movement in the Soviet Union similar to those in Hungary, Poland
and the GDR (East Germany),'' Krol said.

<HEAD>To Sit or Squat: Tokyo Teachers Clash Over Toilets</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times change and so should toilets, one school
board in Tokyo has said.
   But board officials in Edogawa Ward trying to phase-out
Japanese-style ``squat'' toilets in public schools have met
opposition from parents and teachers who believe the Western-style
``sit-down'' version is unclean.
   It would stand to reason that millions of Westerners can't be
wrong, but Edogawa school board official Maoto Mori said Tuesday
that while most Japanese use Western toilets at home, many would
prefer not to use them elsewhere.
   ``The problem is that you actually place your (bottom) directly
on a Western-style toilet,'' Mori said. ``Some people, especially
women, have said they just aren't comfortable using such toilets in
public.''
   But Mori says there is nothing to worry about: ``Concerns about
sanitation are completely unnecessary.''
   To assure comfort for all, Mori said the board has suggested
that for every seven toilets in each school, five be Western and
two Japanese. Three schools in the ward will remodel their
lavatories this year, he said.
   One does not sit on, or in any other way come in contact with, a
Japanese-style toilet, which is a porcelained hole in the floor.
Many Japanese even refuse to touch the flush lever of public
toilets with their hands, using their feet instead.
   The Edogawa school board has decided to remove Japanese-style
toilets in elementary and junior high schools because of growing
popularity of the Western toilet in private homes.
   According to estimates made by Toto, Japan's main toilet maker,
80 percent of all toilets in Japan, and nearly 100 percent of all
household commodes, are Western-style.
   Mori said opposition to the plan ``has not been that great.''
   But the school toilet dilemma warranted top-of-the-page
treatment Tuesday in the domestic news section of Asahi Shimbun, a
leading national newspaper.
   Under the headline, ``Teachers Say Wait! to Western Toilets,''
was a cartoon depicting two smiling youngsters, one foreign and one
Japanese, using the contending varieties.
   The accompanying article quoted a teacher in one Edogawa
elementary school as complaining that though the Japanese-style
commodes only needed to be cleaned once a week, ``that won't be
enough'' for the Western model.
   It said the Education Ministry has set no national guidelines
regarding which kind of toilet schools should use.
   A school board official in Koto Ward, Edogawa's neighbor, said
schools there were sticking to their Japanese facilities, although
schools have one Western-style toilet on each floor.
   He said Japanese toilets are better because they are easier to
clean and ``generally preferred by women.''
   Japanese toilets also tend to make for shorter visits, perhaps
also a plus in the eyes of Japan's often disciplinarian school
teachers.

<TEXT>
   Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations met
today to negotiate a bitter oil and border dispute. Diplomats said
Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple
the number originally estimated.
   The reported Iraqi troop buildup, including hundreds of tanks
and armored personnel carriers, dwarfs the Kuwaiti army, which has
a total of about 20,000 troops.
   Persian Gulf-based diplomats, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the troops have been concentrated along the border
since last week, when Iraq began threatening Kuwait and accusing
the small Persian Gluf state of stealing oil and conspiring with
the United States. But they said the number of troops was at first
difficult to determine.
   Delegates from the feuding countries first met in the presence
of Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah. Later, the delegation
leaders met privately. Kuwait was represented by its prime
minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, and Iraq by Izzat
Ibrahim, deputy chairman of its Revolutionary Command Council.
   The media were barred from the meetings, and no details were
released.
   The Iraq-Kuwait dispute broke out on July 17 when Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates of driving down oil prices by producing far above the
quota set for them by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Saddam said the quota violations had cost his country
$14 billion because of low oil prices.
   Iraq also demanded compensation for $2.4 billion worth of oil it
claimed Kuwait stole from the Rumailah oil field which straddles
the border between the two nations. Iraq also said Kuwait should
forgive some $15 billion in loans it extended to Baghdad during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988.
   Saddam's tough talk and show of force helped win his country,
and other price hawks at OPEC's meeting last week, an agreement to
raise oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel, as well as pledges that
Kuwait and other quota violators would reduce their production.
   Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials agreed to meet in Jiddah after
intensive mediation efforts by King Fahd and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   Kuwaiti leaders had insisted that Iraq pull back its troops
before conciliation talks could began, but later dropped its demand.
   Kuwaiti officials are also asking that Iraq agree to demarcate
the disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq has refused.
   Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait and has long
coveted the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which command
access to southern Iraqi ports.
   Diplomatic sources have said they expected Arab mediators to
persuade the two sides to sign a treaty of non-belligerency as a
first step to protracted negotiations on borders and compensation.
   In Kuwait, newspapers expressed hope that the Jiddah meeting
would lead to ``a final just settlement'' of the Iraq-Kuwait
dispute in a manner ensuring the ``legitimate rights of each of the
two countries.''
   Baghdad papers adopted a harsher line, stressing that the Jiddah
meeting was an opportunity for Kuwait to ``perceive Iraq's demands
and respond to its rights.''

<HEAD>After Three Centuries, Rembrandt Gets First International Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rembrandt will get his first
one-man international show next year, when 130 of the 17th century
Dutch Master's works will tour Berlin, Amsterdam and London,
organizers said Tuesday.
   Although Rembrandt's paintings have been on tour before, the
September-May show will be the first touring exhibition devoted
exclusively to the greatest artist of the Netherlands' Golden Age,
organizers said.
   ``As far as I know there has never been a traveling exhibition
on Rembrandt before,'' said Uwe Wieczorek of Berlin's
Gemaeldegalerie, which is putting together the tour together with
Berlin's Kupferstichkabinett, Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum and London's
National Gallery.
   The Rijksmuseum held the largest previous exhibition of
Rembrandt's works in 1969, with about 20 works on display.
   The announcement of next year's tour comes on the heels of a
major exhibit of the works of the 19th century Dutch impressionist,
Vincent van Gogh.
   The four-month Van Gogh exhibit, which ended Sunday, drew more
than 1.2 million visitors to Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the
Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the eastern Dutch city of Otterlo.
   Wieczorek said the plan of the exhibition is to ``show paintings
once attributed to Rembrandt that are now being attributed to his
pupils and compare them to paintings which we are absolutely sure
were Rembrandt's.''
   He added that the Rembrandt exhibition will mark the end of two
decades of research into the master's works by art experts.
   That research is expected to show that half of the existing 400
paintings thought to be done by Rembrandt were actually painted by
others, Wieczorek said.
   The exposition will display 50 paintings, 40 drawings and 40
etchings by Rembrandt and 45 or so works by his pupils.
   Among the paintings to be displayed are ``Woman Bathing,''
``Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem'' and ``The
Mennonite Preacher Anslo and His Wife.''
   Rembrandt, who lived from 1606 to 1669, is considered the
greatest of the Dutch Old Masters who flourished in the 17th
century.
   His style is famous for its masterful contrast of light and
darkness.

   A House Armed Services panel today slashed
nearly $2 billion from President Bush's fiscal 1991 budget request
for the Strategic Defense Initiative, lawmakers said.
   In a closed-door session, the subcommittee on research and
development approved spending $2.9 billion on the anti-missile
shield, commonly known as Star Wars. Bush had sought $4.7 billion
for SDI in the military budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The full Armed Services Committee was meeting later in the day
to put the finishing touches on its $283 billion defense bill, a
reduction of $24 billion from the president's original request in
January.
   The research subcommittee also eliminated $548 million Bush
sought for the MX nuclear missile on railroad cars and $202 million
in research money for the Midgetman missile.
   Instead, the panel set up an advanced strategic missile pot of
more than $600 million for development of the next generation of
nuclear missiles. The subcommittee also called on Bush to make a
recommendation in 90 days for one new missile.
   The full Armed Services Committee is expected to approve the
actions of the research and development subcommittee, which
overwhelmingly adopted its portion of the defense bill by a vote of
17-4.
   Following the lead of the procurement subcommittee, which on
Monday night eliminated all funds Bush sought for the B-2 stealth
bomber, the research subcommittee approved enough funds to complete
the program at the 15 planes under development.
   In addition, the research panel approved $238 million for the
V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney wants to cancel. The procurement subcommittee had added $165
million for the aircraft, which takes off like a helicopter but can
fly like a plane.
   ``It's exactly where we want it to be,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon,
R-Pa., a supporter of the V-22 Osprey, which is manufactured in his
district.
   The congressman said the House Armed Services actions set the
stage for bargaining with the Bush administration and the Senate on
saving the aircraft from the budget ax.
   Following the lead of its chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the
panel on procurement and military nuclear systems adopted a plan
Monday to remove the money the Pentagon requested to buy two
stealth aircraft.
   To meet the House-approved level for military spending in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the procurement subcommittee had to
slash $11 billion from Bush's overall request of $73 billion.
   Among the major subcommittee cuts were $1.3 billion for a
program to move the MX nuclear missile from fixed silos to rail
cars, a $1.2 billion reduction in the classified request for the
Navy's A-12 attack plane and costly restrictions on the C-17
transport plane.
   The panel requires Cheney to certify that the first successful
flight of the C-17 has occurred. After that certification, the Air
Force may seek to reprogram funds to buy two aircraft.
   The administration had requested $2.1 billion for the two planes
and related items.
   The panel eliminated the $1.3 billion Bush sought for the AMRAAM
missile.
   It was the costly and controversial B-2 bomber, however, that
suffered the deepest cut.
   Support for the radar-evading aircraft has eroded in Congress,
where lawmakers have criticized the cost of a single plane _ nearly
$865 million _ in a climate of fiscal constraint and a lessening
Soviet threat to the West.
   Aspin dealt a serious blow to the program last week when he
announced his support for legislation that would end production of
the aircraft, which is manufactured by the Northrop Corp., at the
15 planes under development.
   The chairman's decision came despite Cheney's revised program,
which calls for a total of 75 of the aircraft, instead of 132, with
two of the planes being finished in fiscal 1991, rather than five.
   The aircraft still has support in the Senate, where the Armed
Services panel approved the administration's request. Bipartisan
efforts are expected, however, to kill the program when the full
Senate takes up the defense bill later this week.

   The Senate's Democratic majority turned back a
Republican attempt today to reduce the political clout of unions in
presidential and congressional elections.
   By a 59-41 vote, the Senate rejected a proposal to allow the
nation's 17 million union members to demand a refund of any dues
their unions spend on political activities.
   ``If you don't do anything about this sewer money from unions, I
don't think you have campaign reform,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. ``Ninety percent goes to Democrats, even though 30 percent
to 40 percent of union members are Republicans.''
   The Senate defeated a similar GOP-sponsored plan by a 63-35 vote
in May, rejecting a proposed amendment a bill easing restrictions
on federal employees' political activities.
   That bill was subsequently vetoed by Bush and the Senate
sustained his veto.
   Today, four Republicans, Sens. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Mark
Hatfield of Oregon, James Jeffords of Vermont and Ted Stevens of
Alaska, joined all 55 Democrats to defeat an amendment to a
campaign finance reform bill.
   Bush said a year ago Congress should expand a 1988 Supreme Court
ruling to give workers a right to seek a refund of their dues spent
by unions on politics.
   ``No American, not one, should be compelled to give money to a
candidate against his or her will,'' he said.
   On Monday, Democrats overrode unanimous Republican opposition to
a provision in the bill that would provide $20 million in public
financing to Senate candidates every two years to buy television
advertising time.
   The Supreme Court ruled in the 1988 case that a Bell System
technician who paid fees to the Communications Workers of America
as party of an agency shop contract with AT&amp;T but was not a member
of the union was entitled to a refund of the portion not spent
directly on collective bargaining.
   Hatch's amendment today would have extended that right to union
members as well as non-members covered by collective bargaining
agreements.
   Hatch said most union members do not know that their leaders are
spending up to $150 million of their dues every two years on
political activities such as voter registration.
   With a bipartisan compromise on campaign finance reform out of
reach for now, Republicans appeared content to let Democrats have
their way in the knowledge that President Bush will veto it.
   ``We are faced with a bill that everyone knows isn't going
anywhere, since it's a spending-limits bill that President Bush
simply will not sign,'' said Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, the chief author of the Democratic
measure, acknowledged the bill will never become law without
support from Bush and congressional Republicans. But he expressed
hopes the two sides will sit down in September to strike a deal
once the House has passed its version.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he hoped to bring two
Democratic proposals and a Republican alternative up for votes
before the House begins a five-week recess on Friday. Democratic
sources, however, expressed doubts it could be fitted into this
week's schedule.
   House Republicans accused Democrats in that chamber of cynically
writing a bill that would establish spending ceilings but also
preserve corporate, union and trade association PACs in the face of
a certain veto by Bush.
   ``This is a joke,'' said House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of
Georgia. ``All the reform groups in the country are going to be
enraged at them, so they want to get it over with, take their
beating and go home.''
   In contrast to an abolition of PACs first proposed by Bush and
Republicans in the Senate and now reluctantly also endorsed by
Senate Democrats, both parties' bills in the House would retain
PACs.
   House Republicans would reduce the contributions a single PAC
can make to any one candidate from the currently allowed $10,000 to
$2,000 for both primary and general elections.
   Both Democratic proposals in the House would establish a
spending ceiling of $550,000 on House races. One would limit PAC
contributions to half that amount and the other would limit them to
40 percent, but with up to $100,000 in public financing for each
qualifying candidate.
   Reform groups considered a litmus test the Senate's vote Monday
to provide party nominees for the Senate from $180,000 to $1.1
million each in government vouchers to buy broadcasting time if
they abide by spending limits.
   ``It's a back-door attack on spending limits and a test vote to
see where they stand,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, which supports taxpayer financing of election campaigns.
   All 44 Republicans present voted for the amendment by McConnell,
the leading opponent of the Democratic plan to strike from it what
it called a ``food stamp voucher for politicians.'' Two Democrats,
Howell Heflin of Alabama and J. James Exon of Nebraska, both
longtime opponents of public financing, also supported McConnell's
amendment.
   In addition to the public financing of TV ads, the Democratic
bill provides discount mail subsidies to candidates abiding by the
spending limits as well as funds to counter broadcast ads by
independent groups costing over $10,000.
   Additional public financing would also be provided to candidates
whose opponents exceed the voluntary spending ceilings.
   McConnell's amendment would have eliminated all those potential
public sources of money in the Democratic bill. ``Underneath the
hood, it's the same old lemon running on taxpayer financing and
spending limits,'' he said.
   The Democratic-proposed spending limits on Senate races _ based
on the size of a state's voting-age population _ range from
slightly under $2 million in less-populous states, such as Nevada,
Montana and North Dakota, to $10.3 million in the largest state,
California.

   Testimony in the federal court challenge to
Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law today took aim at a
provision requiring women to notify their husbands before getting
abortions.
   Attorneys for a group of doctors and abortion clinics seeking to
overturn key sections of the law tried to show that battered women
would not take advantage of exemptions in the law from the
notification requirement.
   Psychologist Lenore Walker testified that ``battered women are
very reluctant to talk about'' physical or emotional abuse because
that forces them to relive the painful experience.
   As for the requirement that husbands be notified of abortions,
``forcing a battered woman to notify her husband is like giving him
a hammer to beat her,'' she said.
   Under the law, women would have to sign a statement for their
doctor certifying that they had informed their husband, or that
they had not because they feared bodily harm if they did so,
because the husband was not the father, because the pregnancy
resulted from spousal rape, or because the woman could not locate
the husband ``after diligent effort.''
   The only exception for the requirement of a signed statement
would be in the case of a medical emergency.
   Ms. Walker also criticized a section of the law that requires a
24-hour waiting period for an abortion. Ms. Walker said forcing an
abused woman to wait 24 hours before obtaining an abortion would be
detrimental.
   The case, which opened Monday, is being watched by activists on
both sides of the abortion debate because of its potential to
present a challenge to Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that
established the right to an abortion.
   The lawsuit argues that the abortion controls passed by the
Legislature in 1988 and 1989 infringe on the rights of women.
   The measures require a woman to notify her husband before
obtaining an abortion and wait 24 hours between visiting a clinic
and receiving an abortion. Doctors must offer counseling to women
seeking abortions, and minors must get the consent of one parent or
a court order to receive an abortion.
   Portions of the law have been blocked by the federal court
pending a ruling on the lawsuit.
   Only Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, has adopted more
stringent controls.
   U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III is not expected to rule
until the fall, and whatever the outcome, appeals are likely.
   Kathryn Kolbert, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney for
the plaintiffs, testified Monday the law erodes privacy rights
established under Roe.
   ``This act puts government in the operating room and at the
kitchen table with women making decisions on abortion,'' she said.
``It questions the ability of women to make independent decisions.''
   Other witnesses characterized the law as studded with provisions
that might not be in the best interest of the patient's health.
   Senior Deputy Attorney General Kate L. Mershimer, representing
the state, predicted the restrictions would be upheld. ``We think
we have the evidence in the current Supreme Court cases to uphold
the statute,'' Ms. Mershimer said.
   Some sections of the law are similar to those ruled
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1986 Pennsylvania
case.
   The state's 1988 law was largely an attempt to redraft many of
the voided provisions. The 1989 law was passed after the Supreme
Court, in a Missouri case, gave states greater leeway to restrict
abortion.

   Actor Ed Asner on Tuesday compared
giving the Khmer Rouge a role in a new Cambodian government with
allowing the Nazis to form a new government.
   The actor, known for his roles as crusty newsmen on the
television series ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``Lou Grant,''
toured Cambodia last week with representatives of Operation U.S.A.,
a Los Angeles-based relief organization that funds medical training
in the Southeast Asian nation.
   Asner said he became concerned about Cambodia when he realized
the proposed transitional government recognized by the United
Nations included the Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of
thousands of people during its 1975 to 1978 reign. Vietnam
installed the current communist government after invading in late
1978.
   The Khmer Rouge now dominate a guerilla coalition fighting the
government.
   ``I don't know why the Vietnamese are more hated than the Khmer
Rouge,'' Asner said.

   The White House expressed frustration with
stalled budget talks and prodded Democrats today to come up with
their own plan to reduce the $169 billion federal deficit.
   ``An agreement was made to simultaneously table proposals. We
are ready. They are not,'' deputy White House press secretary Alixe
Glen said after President Bush's latest round of talks with the
leaders of Congress. ``That's where the level of frustration is
coming in.''
   Once the Democrats put a package on the table, ``we can continue
to move forward, probably at a faster pace,'' she said.
   ``I don't think anybody sandbagged anybody,'' Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority leader, said after the
hour-long Oval Office meeting.
   Gephardt said he did not think ``there was any reneging'' on the
Democrats' part about putting proposals on the table simultaneously.
   Gephardt added, ``There may have been some miscommunication
about what was supposed to happen.''
   ``It's safe to assume that everyone is frustrated. ... We've
been at this for 83 days,'' Ms. Glen told reporters. ``I think all
sides would have hopes that we would have been a little farther
along by this point.''
   Gephardt said the two sides will decide ``in the next few days''
whether to keep negotiating into August or wait until September to
put their plans for slashing spending on the table.
   If they decide to go ahead now, Gephardt said, it could mean
keeping Congress in session or calling the lawmakers back from
vacation to ratify a deal.
   Today's meeting took place against the backdrop of complaints
from GOP leaders upset with Democrats for failing to propose a
deficit-cutting plan. Details of Republican-favored tax increases
began filtering out of the talks last week.
   ``The question is when is the best time to try to put together
the final disagreements, to bridge them and then to put a deal
before the American people and Congress,'' said Gephardt. ``There
are good arguments on both sides for August, and there are other
arguments for September. It will be decided in the next few days.''
   If the negotiators wait until September, it will allow Bush and
the lawmakers to take their summer vacations without embracing
controversial packages of spending cuts and revenue increases.
   But pushing the showdown into September would bring the summit
negotiators closer to the Gramm-Rudman deadline of Oct. 1, when
automatic cuts would be inflicted on most federal programs if Bush
and the lawmakers fail to produce their own agreement.
   Gephardt said the negotiations, now in their 12th week, have
accomplished ``quite a lot,'' including the basic agreement to
reduce the deficit by $50 billion in the first year and $500
billion over five years.
   In the aftermath of news reports revealing higher taxes and
other unpopular elements of an administration budget plan, GOP
leaders spent an hour with Bush on Monday discussing what their
next step should be.
   ``I don't think the president has been nearly tough enough on
the Democrats,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., told reporters after
Monday's session. ``All the Republicans advised him it was time to
call their hand.''
   Congressional Democrats said they feel little pressure to
quickly present a deficit-cutting plan to Republican budget
negotiators.
   ``Plans put forward by leaks never cause response requirements
on the other side of the negotiations,'' said House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash.
   The GOP leaders said that among the options they discussed was
having Bush call a special session to keep Congress in town in
August and force lawmakers to work out a budget deal.
   ``Keep them here, and turn the air conditioning off,'' said Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass.
   Canceling the cherished annual summer recess, however, would
anger many members of Congress, some leaders acknowledged.
   ``The president doesn't want to alienate members when he wants
to work with Congress,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill.
   The administration plan includes higher taxes on alcohol and a
limit on the federal tax deductibility of state and local income
taxes.
   Congress' month-long recess is set to begin over the next two
weeks. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1. The talks began May 15.

   The failure of Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to forge an agreement with Southeast Asian
nations on the fate of boat people leaves the refugees in danger of
being pushed back out to sea.
   Baker ended a five-day tour of Southeast Asia on Tuesday,
leaving Singapore for the Soviet Union for meetings with his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   While Baker was in Southeast Asia, both sides had hoped a
solution would be found for the 130,000 boat people _ mostly from
Vietnam and Cambodia _ in refugee camps in the region. Southeast
Asian officials say about 80 percent are non-political refugees and
should be repatriated.
   The United States and Vietnam have refused to sanction the
compulsory return of refugees who flee their homeland for economic
reasons, rather than political persecution.
   Shortly before Baker arrived, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations comprising Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Brunei, declared their right to refuse temporary
refuge to boat people.
   Malaysia has taken the lead, pushing off more than 8,700 people
in the past year, according to refugee workers.
   At the association's annual meeting, Baker sought compromise but
issued a veiled warning. Going it alone, he said in an apparent
reference to Malaysia, ``would leave the nations of this region to
reap a whirlwind of humanity without international support.''
   Baker, however, agreed to create a new category for refugees who
do not object to being sent home. He also offered to ``join with
others in a new best effort to resettle or return all asylum
seekers by the end of 1992.''
   Boat people in the new category would qualify for repatriation
after specified review procedures were completed and other
conditions met, U.S. officials said.
   ``We appreciate these moves, but we in ASEAN think they don't
yet go far enough,'' Indonesia Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
referring to the Southeast Asian association.
   In danger of collapse is the Comprehensive Plan of Action signed
in Geneva by 35 nations in June 1989.
   That stipulates Southeast Asian countries should continue to
provide shelter for all who arrive but boat people would no longer
automatically qualify for refugee status.
   Instead, refugees would be screened to determine whether they
had a justifiable fear of political persecution or were simply
seeking a better life in the West. Economic migrants would be sent
back home.
   In an attempt to break the stalemate, the European Community has
offered financial incentives designed to encourage more voluntary
repatriation and ease the burden of maintaining boat people in
Southeast Asian Camps.
   The offer has been well-received, said Abel Matutes, EC
commissioner of North-South affairs, and more details on the offer
were to be given to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees by
October. It was not immediately clear when the offer was made.

   An earthquake rocked southwestern Greece
on Tuesday, but police reported no damage or injuries.
   The Athens Geodynamic Institute said the quake struck at 9:50
a.m. in the sea west of Filiatra on the Peloponnesus peninsula. It
measured 5 on the Richter scale, and its epicenter was about 135
miles southwest of Athens.
   A police officer contacted in the region said there were no
reports of damages or injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an

   A United Nations relief agency resumed
deliveries of emergency food to northeastern Uganda on Tuesday
after a three-week suspension caused by an attack on a convoy.
   Appolo Lawoko, an employee of the World Food Program, said seven
trucks loaded with 210 tons of corn headed for the arid Karamonja
region under a military escort.
   The World Food Program stopped deliveries July 7 after
unidentified gunmen killed a driver and seriously wounded two
people loading the trucks.
   Only 1,173 of the 5,000 tons of grain the agency earmarked for
Karamonja this year had been delivered when the attack occurred.
   Relief officials in Kampala say an estimated 220,000 people in
the region are threatened with famine caused by a severe drought.
   In 1980, starvation caused by a similar drought killed thousands
of mainly nomadic people in Karamonja, which borders Kenya in the
east and Sudan in the north.
   The region is also home to remnants of insurgent groups who took
up arms against President Yoweri Museveni after he seized power in
1986.

<HEAD>Murders Headed for a Record Year, Senators Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's murder toll is headed toward a
record high this year, with an 8 percent expected increase in the
number of slayings that is attributable mainly to drug-related
crime, the Senate was told today.
   ``If this pace continues _ and there is every reason to believe
it will _ 1990 will be the bloodiest year in American history,''
said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.
   The committee issued a forecast of 23,220 murders in America
this year at the present rate. That is 2,000 or 8 percent over the
1989 toll. The total would also top the previous record high of
23,040 murders in 1980.
   Scarce supplies of cocaine in the nation's major cities have
contributed to the carnage, causing drug pushers to fight each
other for turf, the committee said.
   It also blamed the proliferation of assault rifles. ``These
firearms have become the weapons of choice for drug dealers and the
weapons of doom for law enforcement personnel,'' said a report
prepared by the panel. It said a third cause is a fresh wave of
teen-agers, the offspring of the so-called baby boomers, entering
the high-crime years.
   The projected toll would make 1990 the third straight year of
increasing murders in the United States.
   The murder toll actually dropped 18 percent between 1980 and
1985 but has increased 22 percent since then, the committee said.
   ``The nation is faced with an immediate peril and the situation
is doomed to get worse unless we take action today,'' Biden said.
He urged swift House action on a Senate-passed omnibus crime bill
with a ban on nine semiautomatic assault weapons and the death
penalty for 34 federal offenses.
   A hush fell over the hearing room as Dr. Lynn Richardson,
associate chief of emergency services at Harlem Hospital Center in
New York, told of a young woman rushed in several weeks ago. The
right side of her head had been blown away by a slug from a
high-powered rifle in an apparent drug-corner shootout.
   Doctors managed to save a 6 1@2-month-old fetus, ``the ultimate
innocent bystander,'' she said. The woman died but the child is
still clinging to life, she said.

   Two tourists were wounded during the
latest in a string of robberies in the city's restored colonial
town. Patrols will be increased in the dimly lit area, police said
Tuesday.
   Five armed robberies have taken place in Williamsburg's historic
area since May, said police Maj. Mike Yost. He said patrols in the
one-square-mile area will be increased from one police cruiser to
three.
   The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation also has increased security
in the area. The foundation maintains the restored buildings in the
historic area, which is open to pedestian traffic.
   The tourists, Anne and David Edds of Swayzee, Ind., were both
shot in the head during the robbery attempt Monday evening. Police
said two teen-age boys accosted the couple, demanded money and
threatened to shoot them.
   The youths fled after one shot the couple when no money was
produced.
   Mrs. Edds was in satisfactory condition with a bullet lodged in
her face at at Williamsburg Community Hospital, said W.M.
McCracken, vice president of nursing. Her husband was treated for a
bullet wound to the side of his face.

<HEAD>Sales of New Homes Surge in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes surged 8 percent in June,
the sharpest increase since November, the government said Tuesday
in a report that many analysts said indicates the sluggish housing
industry has bottomed out.
   ``We believe that the second quarter was the low point,'' said
David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home
Builders. He and other analysts said they expected continued but
subdued growth in both new and existing single-family markets for
the remainder of the year.
   The Commerce Department said new home sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 581,000 units after posting a revised 2.3
percent gain in May. May sales first were reported last month to
have risen just 0.4 percent, the first advance in five months.
   Despite the increase in June, new homes sales for the first six
months of 1990 have fallen 9.7 percent below sales of the first
half of 1989 when they totaled 340,000 units.
   The June increase was the sharpest since a similar 8 percent
gain in November. Analysts attributed the increase to lower
mortgage rates, which they said should spur renewed interest in
home sales for the remainder of the year.
   ``We expect mortgage rates to trend downward in the weeks ahead,
which should boost sales of new homes as well as existing homes,''
said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association
of Realtors.
   The Realtors reported last week that sales of existing homes
rose 1.2 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.34 million units. It was the first increase since a 3.2 percent
gain in November.
   The average rate for 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages
ranged from 10.29 percent to 10.10 percent in June, according to
surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The rate had
dropped to 9.98 percent by last Friday.
   Nevertheless, Mark Obrinksy, an economist with the Federal
National Mortgage Association, and other analysts said they did not
expect rates to fall much farther and they predict only a gradual
increase in future sales.
   In addition to the ``psychological factor'' of single-digit
rates, Richard Peach, deputy chief economist with the Mortgage
Bankers of America, said favorable weather also enticed buyers in
June.
   ``We had a very soggy April and May, particularly in the eastern
part of the country,'' Peach said. ``When it's cold and damp,
people don't like to go out and shop around for new houses.''
   Sales in the Northeast, which have been sluggish for more than a
year, jumped 36 percent to an annual rate of 102,000 units. Sales
also rose in the South, up 13.6 percent to an annual rate of
243,000 units.
   But they dropped elsewhere _ down 5.8 percent to an annual rate
of 146,000 units in the West and off 4.3 percent to an annual rate
of 90,000 units in the Midwest.
   The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home rose
1.6 percent to $129,900. The median income means half of the homes
cost more and half less. The average price advanced 2.1 percent to
$152,900.

<HEAD>First Gene Therapies Approved for Treating Fatal Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal committee today approved history's
first use of gene therapy to treat fatal diseases.
   The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the National
Institutes of Health approved two procedures in which foreign genes
will be inserted into the cells of patients who have one of two
fatal diseases.
   The therapies are for treatment of patients with a malignant
skin cancer and for children with an inherited immune system
deficiency.
   ``This is an historic decision,'' said Gerard J. McGarrity, the
chairman of the committee. ``What we have done today is add gene
therapy to vaccines, antibiotics and radiation in the medical
arsenal.
   ``Medicine has been waiting thousands of years for this,'' said
McGarrity, the president of the Coriell Institute for Medical
Research in New Jersey.
   The cancer therapy will involve putting a gene that causes cells
to produce a protein called tumor necrosis factor into special
white blood cells. These cells will then be injected into the
patient and the tumor necrosis factor will attack the skin cancer
tumors.
   The immune disease treatment calls for placing a gene into white
blood cells of patients who are born without this gene. The gene in
a normal person produces an essential enzyme for the development of
the immune system. Children born without this gene have virtually
no immune system or bodily defense against disease.
   The most famous patient with this immunity disorder was a boy in
Houston, known only as David, who spent his whole life in a plastic
bubble.
   McGarrity said that the 17-member committee voted unanimously
for the cancer therapy and had only one dissenting vote for the
immunity disorder therapy.
   Gene therapy has been controversial and a number of groups have
resisted its implementation. But the vote today met almost no
objections from people attending the open meeting.
   Some groups fear that gene therapy could be used to manipulate
normal human development and create genetic abnormalities.
   Dr. French Anderson, director of the immune deficiency treatment
program, said that abuses of this technique are guarded against by
a torturous pathway to approval. He said it has taken more than
three years and presentations to more than a dozen committees and
hearings for the therapy to be approved.
   Despite difficulties, Anderson said the therapy ``is so powerful
that it could be abused and there needs to be firm safeguards in
place.''

   Three men were arrested and charged with murder
today in the death of a 9-month-old boy gunned down a day earlier
in a Bronx apartment, the city's fourth child shooting victim in
just over a week.
   The suspects were charged with second-degree murder and
possession of a deadly weapon, said Police Commissioner Lee Brown.
A 9mm handgun allegedly used to kill the infant was recovered at
the home of one suspect, he said.
   The arrests come less than 24 hours after the slaying of Rayvon
Jamison, who was killed when someone fired seven bullets through
the door of his family's apartment.
   Charged in the murder were Anthony Rupert, 18, and two cousins,
Bobbie West, 18, and Mike Solomon, 22, all of the Bronx, said
Brown. The attack followed a fight between Rayvon's uncle and
several neighborhood men, authorities said.
   ``No remorse was shown by the three men'' when they learned of
the child's death, said Detective Ellen Hale of the 44th Precinct.
   On Monday, mourners packed a church for the funeral of
9-year-old Veronica Corales, who was shot in the head as she slept
in a family car after coming home from a family outing at an
amusement park.
   Mayor David Dinkins seized on the slayings to call for a federal
ban on all assault weapons.
   ``Do we need further proof of what happens when we allow so many
people to be armed with so many guns firing so many bullets?'' he
asked.
   ``Our children are dying. These young people, these babies, had
the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but their
rights have been blown away. And for what?''
   Rayvon, the latest victim, was in a walker when he was struck in
the shoulder by two of seven shots pumped into the apartment,
police said. Nine adults, including his mother, were home at the
time.
   Rayvon's slaying in a working-class, black and Hispanic
neighborhood in the Bronx was the fourth in New York City in nine
days of a child hit by a bullet apparently meant for someone else.
The three other slayings occurred in Brooklyn.
   ``It's crazy. You're not safe in your own house no more,'' said
Ramon Garcia, who lives across the street from where Rayvon was
shot.
   Veronica was struck July 22 by a stray bullet as she slept in
her mother's lap in a parked car.
   Shortly after her funeral, an indictment was unsealed charging
Dorian Daughtry, 22, a former minor league baseball player, with
murder in the slaying.
   One-year-old Yaritimi Fruto was killed last week by gunmen who
also killed her father. Ben Williams, 3, also was killed last week,
when someone fired 18 shots through the door of his grandmother's
apartment while he slept on a fold-out couch.
   There were no arrests in those shootings.

   FAO Schwarz, a symbol of kiddie
chic in America for decades, has been purchased by the Netherlands'
most prestigious department store chain, the Dutch buyer announced
today.
   NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer, or KBB, said it bought FAO
Schwarz for an undisclosed amount, and would use the American toy
palace's prestigious name to expand its U.S. operations.
   ``FAO Schwarz is the pre-eminent retailer of fine toys in the
world and we are committed to building on FAO's tradition of
excellence,'' Arie Maas, Chairman of KBB, said in a statement.
   At the up-market end of KBB's Dutch operations is the Bijenkorf
department store chain, which sells exclusive fashions, cosmetics
and furniture, as well as elaborate toys. Its flagship store is a
landmark in the center of Amsterdam, right across the street from
the city's royal palace. Bijenkorf means beehive in Dutch.
   The publicly owned corporation said it had bought all of FAO
Schwarz's 17 stores, including the two most prominent outlets in
New York and San Francisco as well as stores in Boston, Chicago and
Beverly Hills, Calif. The purchase includes the toy chain's catalog
business.
   KBB's 1989 sales totaled $1.67 billion.
   FAO Schwarz, which was founded in 1862, has been privately owned
by a group led by Peter C. Morse, chairman, and Peter L. Harris,
president and chief executive officer. Morse is leaving the
company, but Harris and the rest of the present management team are
expected to continue in their roles after the acquisition.
   In its 100-plus years of operation, FAO Schwarz has become a toy
retailing phenomenon known for lavish displays and elaborate
presentations of new products.
   Among the cities with branches are Boston, Chicago and Beverly
Hills, Calif.

   The Coast Guard said 500,000 gallons of
oil leaked into Galveston Bay from two barges, 10 times its
original estimate, and some oil floated ashore from a slick up to
15 miles long.
   None of the oil had yet touched environmentally sensitive
marshes, the Coast Guard said. State officials talked with the
Coast Guard today about using oil-eating bacteria on the heavy
crude.
   Skimmer ships and floating booms were sent to the area. Some
streamers of oil had reached the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard
said.
   The barges, carrying a total of 1.68 million gallons of heavy
refinery oil, collided Saturday with the Greek-registered tanker
Shinoussa while being towed by a tug through the bay. The tanker,
while damaged, did not leak any of its 24,900 metric tons of jet
fuel.
   Some of the oil had reached the Texas City Dike and Pelican
Island and Redfish Island _ peninsulas in Galveston Bay _ this
morning, the Coast Guard said after officials flew over this site.
   `Those areas aren't heavily populated with wildlife,'' Coast
Guard Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson said today. ``There are other
areas in Galveston Bay where there's a lot of wildlife and we're
still concerned about those areas.''
   The spill already has killed fish around Redfish Island and
officials were worried about its impact on wildlife in marshes and
bogs in the area. No oil-covered birds had been found yet.
   ``Any way that spill heads, it is going toward wetlands and
estuaries, with unique species of herons, egrets, wading birds and
nesting birds. And it is very probable that we are going to have
impact on them soon,'' Nelson said Monday.
   Environmentalists criticized the cleanup effort, saying
emergency officials wasted precious time getting skimmers and oil
booms to the site.
   ``We're not happy with that either,'' Nelson said today. ``We're
also not happy that it took two days to get skimmers on site,
either.''
   He blamed the delay on problems getting permission for skimmers
from the Clean Gulf Co-Op, an organization of Gulf shippers, since
the barge does not belong to the co-op.
   Texas Water Commission Chairman Buck Wynne and Blanton Moore, a
representative of state Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, met with the
Coast Guard today for permission to put oil-eating microbes on the
spill.
   Mauro said the microbes were successfully tested on a spill
after the June 8 explosion on the Mega Borg. Almost 4 million
gallons of light crude spilled into the Gulf from the stricken
Norwegian supertanker.
   The revised estimate of the size of the latest spill came after
crews Monday finished removing oil from a listing barge, pushed it
aground and determined how much oil was left in a second barge
partly submerged in the channel.
   The second barge stopped leaking Monday evening, about 50 hours
after the collision, they said. Officials estimated 48,000 gallons
of oil leaked from the listing barge, meaning most of the oil came
from the nearly sunken vessel.
   Divers today placed cable slings around the barge, which was
sitting on a ledge. Nelson said the sling operation had to be
handled carefully because a mistake could send the barge toppling
into the 40-foot-deep shipping channel and more oil could spill.
   Thousands of feet of collection booms surrounded that barge.
   Any spill over 100,000 gallons is considered major, said the
Coast Guard, which originally estimated 50,000 gallons had spilled.
   The spill forced the closing of the busy channel and idled
nearly 60 ships in the gulf and at Houston's docks.
   ``It is holding up traffic and will continue to do that. It is
unlikely that channel traffic will be opened up'' today, Nelson
said.
   Nelson said the oil was not as toxic to wildlife as that spilled
in the Gulf by the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg earlier this summer.
   But it is thicker and more ``environmentally persistent'' in its
ability to stick to shorelines, he said. The Mega Borg spilled 3.9
million gallons.

<HEAD>US Places Curbs on Exports to Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is placing new restrictions
on exports of items to Iraq which could be used for that country's
development of missiles or chemical and biological weapons,
Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly told Congress on Tuesday.
   And he said the Bush administration also has under ``active
consideration'' the step of returning Iraq to the U.S. list of
nations which sponsor or support terrorism, which would carry
additional economic sanctions.
   Iraq's threats against against neighboring Kuwait and its
massing of troops along the two countries' disputed border are just
the latest moves by President Saddam Hussein that cause ``grave
concern'' in the United States, Kelly told the House Foreign
Affairs Middle East subcommittee.
   ``Iraq is a major power in the region. This power carries
responsibility with it,'' he said in a statement.
   Kelly's comments, the most detailed public explanation yet of
administration moves against Iraq, came a day before the full
Foreign Affairs Committee was to vote on much tougher legislation
proposed by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., imposing a range of
sanctions on Iraq.
   The State Department has asked the Commerce Department to place
restrictions on export of items with potential weapons uses that
are much like the curbs already in place for nuclear technology,
according to Kelly's testimony and to congressional sources briefed
on the moves.
   The change would mean a license is required for any item that
could be destined for a program of chemical or biological weapons
development, or for use in developing missile delivery systems for
weapons, Kelly said.
   New restrictions should be put in place within the next month,
he said under questioning from the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind.
   Kelly added that the sanctions, which stem from worries about
the proliferation of destabilizing weaponry in the region and
Hussein's threats to use them, would not have a major impact on
bilateral trade. The United States sold some $1.3 billion worth of
goods to Iraq last year, most of it farm commodities.
   The sanctions are being imposed under a law that allows the
government to restrict exports in order to distance the United
States from the activities of other governments which it finds
objectionable.
   Asked whether the administration contemplates additional steps
aimed at Iraq's alleged support for terrorists, Kelly said: ``We
are reviewing that matter and we have that under active
consideration.''
   But he said the administration remains opposed to the Berman
legislation because it would allow the president little flexibility
to lift the sanctions unless he could certify that Iraq was meeting
human rights, weapons proliferation and terrorism concerns.
   ``We believe what are needed are devices to modulate actions
against countries, not meataxe approaches,'' Kelly told the
subcommittee.
   Of the overall situation in the Middle East, Kelly said tensions
are higher than a year ago. But asked by Hamilton if he were
fearful of war, Kelly responded: ``If I were I don't think I'd want
to say it before this body.''
   Kelly also denied an assertion by Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.,
that sour personal relations between President Bush and Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir have hampered progress in the Middle
East peace process. ``To personalize the relationship ... does a
disservice to both governments,'' he said.
   But Levine contended that the situation is nonetheless real.
``There is no warmth'' between the two leaders, he said, adding
that Bush often omits mention of Shamir when talking about his
contacts with leaders in the region.

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes that Liberia's bloody civil
war would end with a quick victory over President Samuel Doe have
vanished as rebels hungry for power and vengeance fight among
themselves.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor, who had bragged in interviews that
he would chase Doe from his presidential mansion in the Liberian
capital, Monrovia, remains bogged down in fighting six miles away.
   Fighters loyal to Prince Johnson, who split with Taylor three
months ago, have fought their way into the city center, where Doe
remains in his fortified Israeli-built mansion, guarded by loyal
troops. Doe has refused to resign.
   At one stage in the siege of the capital, the rebels suddenly
withdrew from their positions around Monrovia, reportedly because
Johnson's forces had attacked Taylor's men.
   ``Doe does not want to relinquish power. Charles Taylor wants
power at all cost. Prince Johnson wants to get rid of both,'' said
a senior Western diplomat who has been monitoring reports on the
fighting from his Monrovia embassy.
   Liberia's 2.4 million people are the big losers. Since the civil
war began the vast majority of casualities have been civilians.
   Doe's soldiers began the slaughter in northern Nimba County,
where 100 rebels invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast on Christmas
Eve.
   Angry at their inability to halt the rebel advance, frustrated
troops turned on civilians of the Gio and Mano tribes, killing,
raping, looting and setting homes ablaze. The two tribes form the
main support base for the rebels.
   Initially, the guerrillas did not attack civilians and appeared
to be ``the good guys'' in a battle against a corrupt and
nepotistic government that brutally suppressed opposition. But this
lasted only as long as they were moving through through territory
populated by tribes friendly to their cause.
   As soon as the rebels advanced southward into territory
populated by tribes that backed Doe, reports of the murder of
civilians began to emerge. Most of those killed were members of
Doe's tribe, the Krahn, or the Mandigo tribe, which also backs the
government.
   Monday morning, government troops went on a rampage inside a
refugee center in the capital and carried out one of the worst
known massacres of the war. Survivors said 600 people, mostly women
and children who had been trying to flee the violence, were killed.
The U.S. State Department put the casualties at 200.
   The victims were from the Gio and Mano tribes.
   Doe denied reponsibility for the church atrocity and said it was
carried out by rebels dressed in army uniforms. But survivors said
they were attacked by soldiers speaking Krahn.
   The standoff in Monrovia bears an eerie resemblance to the 1985
coup attempt led by Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa. The general, whose
forces included Johnson, took the entire city of Monrovia by
surprise.
   But Doe and his troops emerged from the mansion and killed them.
   Soldiers subsequently killed thousands of Gios and Manos in
Nimba County, setting the stage for the rebel invasion late last
year.
   For a time it appeared the rebels would quickly take Monrovia.
Western diplomats in the capital, whose governments had switched
sides and now opposed the president, told reporters Doe's soldiers
would flee at the first sight of rebels.
   That was six weeks ago.
   Instead, Taylor's National Patriotic Front has been unable to
break the remnants of Doe's 72nd Infantry Battalion.
   As Taylor remained bogged down outside Monrovia, Johnson's men
waded through a swamp last week to launch a surprise attack on
Doe's forces in downtown Monrovia.
   The arrival of Johnson's men dashed hopes of a simple ending to
the war.
   Taylor accused Johnson of being a tool of the United States,
which he said was trying to stop him from taking power. Johnson
said Taylor was a Communist on Libya's payroll.
   Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian and native African ancestry.
The Americos, descendants of freed American slaves who founded the
country, ruled Liberia until Doe took power in a 1980 coup.
   Doe's coup was hailed throughout the country because it ended
the domination and subjugation of native Liberians by Americos who,
like Doe's Krahn people, constitute only 5 percent of the
population.
   Johnson is the son of Gio parents, and there were fears the
ethnic background of the two men could lead to a new war.

<HEAD>Immigration Law Changes Urged to Attract Foreign Scientists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States needs more scientists from
abroad and must change its laws to attract them or it will see
other countries get the advantage, American scientists told
Congress on Tuesday.
   ``Some countries like Taiwan and (South) Korea have programs to
repatriate their science and engineering nationals from the United
States, offering them financial inducements, including cash
incentives for repatriation, air fares and other benefits,'' said
Karl Willenbrock, assistant director of the National Science
Foundation.
   He said about a third of the advanced researchers in government
laboratories are foreigners who were let in only on condition they
return home when their projects are done.
   There is evidence that Asian scientists who have become U.S.
citizens are going back to their native countries in growing
numbers because of better opportunities, said Philip E. Schambra,
director of the Fogarty International Center at the National
Institutes of Health.
   Schambra said efforts of the 12 countries in the European
Community to dismantle barriers among them are expected to create
five to six million new jobs in service, research and development.
This is happening just as scientists from Eastern Europe are
getting a new chance to move, Schambra pointed out.
   Meanwhile, he said, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have
policies to attract highly skilled immigrants.
   ``How we deal with this issue will to a large degree determine
the pace of research progress on AIDS, cancer (treatment) and other
public health priorities,'' he predicted.
   The laws the scientists want to change favor the admittance of
foreigners related to people already in the United States.
   Family members accounted for 75 out of every 100 legal
immigrants in 1987, while only four out of 100 came for jobs, said
Ronald A. Tekely of the National Foreign Trade Council, an
association of U.S. companies involved in world trade.
   ``It is obvious that our current immigration laws do not promote
the immigration of highly skilled people, despite the shortages in
certain occupations,'' Tekely said.
   Willenbrock said the United States is not producing enough
scientists and engineers of its own.
   ``Increasingly, women and minorities will constitute a larger
percentage of our work force and these groups historically have low
rates of participation in the sciences and engineering,'' he noted.
   All testified before the subcommittee on Science, Research and
Technology of the House Science Committee.

   President Bush and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher will help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the
Aspen Institute, an organization designed to help global leaders
focus on critical issues.
   ``We wanted the strongest leaders we could get,'' said David T.
McLaughlin, president and chief executive officer of the institute.
``It's the first time two heads of state have come. We're
absolutely delighted.''
   Bush is scheduled to give the opening address Thursday at the
institute and Thatcher, who arrives Wednesday, will give the
closing address on Sunday.
   The theme of this year's symposium is ``Renewal: Leadership and
Values for the 21st Century.''
   The nonprofit institute is the brainchild of the late Chicago
businessman Walter Paepcke, whose dream was to help refocus the
world's attention on the cultural contributions of Germans at a
time when its eyes were turned to the brutal horrors left by the
Nazi regime.
   In 1950, he convinced humanist Dr. Albert Schweitzer to travel
from his home in Africa to Aspen to help celebrate the 200th
birthday of German poet and statesman Wolfgang Goethe. That was the
seed that launched the $11 million-a-year institute.
   ``The principle thrust of the institute, then and very much
today, was to bring together leaders from the private sector ... to
really discuss some of the critical issues of our time,'' said
McLaughlin, the former Dartmouth College president who has headed
the institute since 1987.
   When Schweitzer arrived, he found a near ghost town with
mud-paved streets and little else to offer. When Bush and Thatcher
arrive this week, they will find an upscale, posh ski resort.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt and Supreme Court
justices are among the speakers who have addressed the institute.
   Nearly 1,000 people will gather for this year's symposium, which
will feature forums on the environment, education, eastern Europe,
developing Third World countries and national health care.
   Bush and Thatcher are scheduled to meet Thursday, their fourth
round of discussions in three months.
   Prior to her symposium address, Thatcher plans a whirlwind tour
Friday of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder,
and the Strategic Defense Initiative National Test Facility and the
North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs.
   A number of current and former global executives will lead the
symposium forums, including Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve
Board chairman; Rita Klimova, ambassador of the Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic; Robert S. McNamara, former president of the World
Bank Group; and Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   In the past 40 years, the institute has grown from its base in
Aspen to include administrative headquarters at Wye, Md., and
branches in Germany, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

   Federal safety investigators today criticized
Exxon Corp. for operating tankers with reduced crews who don't get
sufficient rest. They said that situation existed on the Exxon
Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's
Prince Williams Sound.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was voting today on the
causes of the nation's worst oil spill.
   Its initial conclusions found that the captain of the vessel
improperly handed over the helm to his third mate. The board said
the mate's fatigue contributed to his inability to guide the vessel
around ice.
   The board found that similar conditions of deck officers with
inadequate rest exist on other Exxon tankers due to a company
policy of operating with reduced crews.
   It also criticized Exxon incentive awards for crews who work
long hours and said the oil company has ``manipulated'' shipboard
reporting of overtime and workload.
   The 340-page report by the National Transportation Safety Board
staff was getting a final review by board members before it is to
be made public in several weeks. The board planned to vote on the
probable cause of the March 24, 1989, spill.
   The panel considered a long list of conclusions and
recommendations stemming from the disaster.
   Among the board's conclusions in the early discussion were:
   _ The decision by the Exxon Valdez captain to leave his third
mate in charge as the tanker was being maneuvered around a massive
ice floe was improper and went against Exxon policies and Coast
Guard rules.
   _ Coast Guard rules on staffing ships do not adquately consider
the workload.
   _ The Coast Guard has been ``unduly narrow in perspective'' in
allowing Exxon ships to operate with inadequate crew, failing to
consider the amount of work required in loading the ships before
they go out to sea.
   Board Chairman James Kolstad said the accident was the costliest
the board ever investigated. He said cleanup costs had so far
totalled $2 billion.
   The investigation was aimed at greatly reducing the risk of
similar accidents, Kolstad said.
   With one vacancy on the five-member NTSB, the possibility of a
deadlock loomed on some issues, although reports normally are not
brought to the final stage until members have had a chance to read
them and discuss any disagreements with staff investigators.
   The report covers drug and alcohol testing of the crew, the
Exxon crew's operation of the vessel, Coast Guard traffic control,
standards for staffing tankers and Coast Guard facilities that
guide them, and government and private emergency response to the
spill, said board spokeswoman Drucella Andersen.
   It does not, however, cover the cleanup operation, which is an
environmental matter, she said.
   Ms. Andersen said the board received no formal complaint or
allegation about the blood alcohol tests taken on Joseph Hazelwood,
the Exxon Valdez's captain, more than 10 hours after his ship broke
open.
   Hazelwood's lawyers claimed last week that tests purportedly
showing that his blood had a .06 percent alcohol content were
botched and were followed by a cover up that denied him a fair
trial earlier this year in Alaska. The Coast Guard standard for
drunkenness is .04 percent.
   An Alaska jury acquitted the captain of being intoxicated but
convicted him on one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of
oil. A judge fined him $50,000 and ordered him to spend 1,000 hours
cleaning Alaskan beaches. Hazelwood has appealed the verdict.
   Last week, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and
misconduct against Hazelwood but suspended his license as a ship's
master for nine months after he pleaded no contest to breaking
Coast Guard rules.
   The violations included drinking within four hours before taking
command of the vessel and leaving the bridge to his first officer
while the tanker was headed for jagged Bligh Reef, where it split
open.
   Safety board conclusions carry no legal force but are used as
possible guidelines for congressional and other government action.
By law, NTSB analyses and conclusions are not admissible as
evidence in courts.
   Kolstad took charge of the investigation shortly after the spill
and sent an eight-member team to look into various aspects of the
accident and the futile attempts to stop the spread of the oil.
   Kolstad received some criticism from former board investigators
for not going to the site himself. He said he did not want to add
to the list of high-profile transportation and environmental
officials drawing attention there.
   Two months after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, the NTSB held a
week-long public hearing in Alaska, interviewing 27 witnesses and
collecting 115 exhibits.
   The 987-foot-long ship has since been renamed the Exxon
Mediterranean and has been undergoing tests for service on oil
trade routes in the Mediterranean Sea or the Middle East.
   The Transportation Department, Congress and other agencies have
looked into various aspects of the spill, but the NTSB conducts the
official inquiry into all accidents involving planes, trains,
ships, highways and pipelines.

   The Irish Republican Army said Tuesday it killed a
British lawmaker because of his friendship with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and his role in developing British policy on
Northern Ireland.
   The group said that as long as Britain controls the province,
``the IRA will continue to strike whenever and wherever the
opportunity arises.'' The statement was sent to Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency.
   Ian Gow, 53, a close adviser to Mrs. Thatcher and a Conservative
Party lawmaker, was killed Monday when a bomb exploded under his
car parked at his home in Hankham, southeast England.
   Gow was chairman of a parliamentary committee on Northern
Ireland that discusses affairs of the province but has no power
over legislation. The IRA has been fighting British rule in the
province for two decades.
   Police believe at least two people were involved in the bombing,
and they may have made several reconnaissance visits to the village
in recent weeks. Scotland Yard set up a telephone hotline Tuesday
to take calls from anyone who may have seen suspicious activity
around the Gow home.
   Rodney Lind, assistant chief constable of the Sussex police,
said police were following leads based on tips from the public.
Police recovered some components of the bomb, and checks were being
made at ports in the belief the assailants may have fled by ferry
to the continent.
   Mrs. Thatcher visited the Gow home to comfort Gow's wife, Jane.
Later she attended a memorial service with Mrs. Gow and her two
sons at the Anglican parish church in Hankham, 60 miles south of
London.
   The Gow and Thatcher families were close and often spent
Christmas together.
   The IRA statement noted Gow was a ``close personal associate''
of Mrs. Thatcher. It also noted Gow was Mrs. Thatcher's personal
parliamentary secretary, and one of her closest advisers from 1979
to 1983.
   Gow also was a close friend of Airey Neave, the Conservative
Party spokesman on Northern Ireland slain by a bomb in 1979. The
Irish National Liberational Army, an IRA splinter group, claimed
responsibility for that attack.
   The Independent newspaper said Tuesday: ``The assassination of
Ian Gow may represent an attempt by the IRA to cause personal hurt
to Margaret Thatcher and goad her into overreacting to his death.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said the slaying would make no difference in her
government's fight against terrorism.
   In a statement issued Tuesday, Mrs. Gow sent a message to the
IRA: ``You will never win.''
   She said her husband's death ``will not diminish our resolve to
be as strong as he was in fighting this terrible wickedness.''
   ``We want to share Ian's great courage in defying evil and
terrorism,'' Mrs. Gow said.
   Scotland Yard's chief anti-terrorist officer, George
Churchill-Coleman, said Gow had been warned he was on a list of 100
lawmakers, judges and civil servants found in an IRA bomb factory
in south London in December 1988.
   Gow's death prompted appeals for increased vigilence by
potential IRA targets. Currently, only politicians of Cabinet rank,
ministers in the Northern Ireland Office and top civil servants
qualify for 24-hour protection.
   Politicians, lawyers and others were urged to remove addresses
and telephone numbers from reference books such as Who's Who, keep
vehicles locked and in a garage overnight, leave front porch lights
burning, avoid announcing plans in advance and check underneath
their cars.
   The IRA has claimed responsiblity for a series of bombings in
England recently, including those at London's Stock Exchange, a
traditional Conservative Party club, and a Royal Air Force base in
northwest London.

<HEAD>Judge Asked to Reduce Sentences of Former PTL Figures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge was asked Tuesday to
reduce the prison sentences of two brothers convicted in the PTL
scandal.
   David and James Taggart, top aides to PTL founder Jim Bakker,
were convicted last year of evading more than $525,000 in income
taxes on $1.2 million they took from the television ministry.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter last year sentenced David
Taggart to 18 years and five months in prison. Potter sentenced
James Taggart to 17 years and nine months. They are imprisoned in
Alabama and must serve 8{ years each before being eligible for
parole.
   Defense attorney Ben Cotten told Potter during a hearing that
the sentences were too harsh because the Taggarts were not ``evil
or mean-spirited'' and they had cooperated with prosecutors. He
said the long sentences did nothing to deter other white-collar
criminals.
   Potter, who said his decision would take a few weeks, disagreed.
   ``I think the length of the sentence does provide some
deterrence,'' he said. ``I think the public recognizes this. If
they see someone who's embezzled a couple of million dollars and
get a couple of years in jail, they'd say he got a pretty good
deal.''
   The Taggarts testified against their former boss in his trial
last fall. Bakker was convicted of 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy and sentenced to 45 years in prison.
   They did not attend the hearing Tuesday.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, who prosecuted Bakker, sat
with Cotten at the hearing and told the judge the Taggarts'
testimony was ``candid and straight-forward.'' Miller declined to
give his opinion on the sentences because he did not prosecute
their cases.
   Earlier this year, Potter reduced the sentence of former PTL
executive Richard Dortch after he testified against Bakker and
other defendants.
   Dortch, who was indicted with Bakker on identical charges,
pleaded guilty to reduced charges before the trial and was
sentenced to eight years in prison. Potter later reduced his
sentence to 30 months.

   President Samuel Doe today vowed to
``fight until the last soldiers in the Liberian army die.''
Guerrilla forces were reported advancing in the capital, taking
over the embassy district.
   Rebels had taken over Mamba Point, where the U.S. Embassy and
British Embassy are located, said the U.S. State Department and
British Foreign Office today.
   The reported rebel advances come one day after government troops
massacred hundreds of people in a Lutheran church compound in
Monrovia.
   The rebels in Mamba Point were believed to be under the command
of Prince Johnson. The main rebel force of his rival, Charles
Taylor, remained bogged down in the city's eastern suburbs.
   ``The situation is that rebel troops of Johnson have moved
through the embassy quarter without inflicting any great damage to
the embassies,'' said a spokesman for the British Foreign Office in
London.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington
that:``The situation on the ground remains fluid. It does appear
that the rebels are in control where the U.S. Embassy is located.''
   Doe, in his first interview in a month, told the BBC that his
troops were not responsible for Monday's massacre.
   ``I do not want to believe that the armed forces of Liberia
would just walk into a church and kill innocent people,'' Doe said.
He said rebels wearing army uniforms attacked the refugees.
   Doe telephoned the BBC from his executive mansion, where he has
been holed up since rebel forces reached the city's suburbs more
than a month ago.
   Witnesses said more than 600 people were killed when government
soldiers stormed the church grounds before dawn Monday and
slaughtered 600 people. Most were children and women, and many had
their heads smashed open or blown to pieces by bullets.
   In Washington, White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart
said Monday that U.S. Embassy officials in Monrovia had confirmed
that government troops slaughtered at least 200 people at the
church compound. There was no independent confirmation of the 600
dead figure.
   President Bush today met with President Gnassingbe Eyadema of
the West African nation of Togo, who told reporters he has been
urging Doe since early this year to talk with the rebels.
   ``But unfortunately, we couldn't get ourselves understood,''
Eyadema said. ``Doe doesn't want to meet anybody. We think that if
at the time the rebels had accepted negotiations, everything would
have been right. They didn't accept that.''
   Today, sources in the Ivory Coast capital of Abidjan said
Liberian troops have bombarded a Christian radio station that was
used by rebels, causing considerable damage.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anoymity, said the attack
forced station ELWA off the air. The attack came after rebel leader
Charles Taylor spoke out on it last week, they said.
   A spokesman for the Sudan Mission in Abidjan, Bob Arnold, said
he could not confirm reports of the attack. But Arnold said the
station's 10 Americans, staff and relatives, evacuated the facility
last Thursday.
   Arnold said the Americans had all left Liberia.
   The victims in Monday's massacre belonged to the Gio and Mano
tribes, which have supported the rebels seeking to overthrow Doe.
Most of Doe's troops are from his Krahn tribe and the Mandingo
tribe.
   It was not the first massacre of civilians in this 7-month-old
war. On May 30, government soldiers attacked U.N. headquarters in
Monrovia, where hundreds of Gios and Manos had taken refuge. They
abducted about 30 men and teen-age boys, and most of the bodies
were found later on a beach outside the capital.
   The rebels also have been accused of killing civilians.
   But none of the attacks has been on the scale of Monday's
massacre.
   The Lutheran World Federation in Geneva said today it was
``horrified and deeply grieved'' by the incident, and it urged the
United Nations to intervene in the civil war. The federation is an
umbrella for 106 Lutheran churches worldwide.
   Relief workers feared many of the wounded would die. A spokesman
for the Belgian group Doctors Without Borders, which is running the
only field hospital operating in Monrovia, said Monday night they
had not been able to get to the church.
   Refugees had sought protection at the church in late May after
government soldiers attacked them at U.N. headquarters in Monrovia.
   Thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war are crowded into
refugee camps in the capital. Their numbers have swelled recently
as rebel troops have stormed the city.
   The rebels invaded in late December from neighboring Ivory Coast
in a bid to oust Doe, whom they accuse of rights abuses and
corruption.

   Ballet master Colin Peasley came to town
searching for some muscle-rippling hunks to perform as extras in
the Australian Ballet's production of ``Spartacus,'' but he should
have looked elsewhere.
   Washington has plenty of government bureaucrats, lawyers and
computer nerds, but Roman gladiators are in short supply.
   Short sleeved shirts with plastic ballpoint pen protectors, yes.
But loincloths? Forget it.
   The Kennedy Center circulated fliers around town announcing
auditions for ``macho he-men'' to appear this week in Hungarian
choreographer Laszlo Seregi's balletic tale of an abortive slave
uprising in ancient Rome.
   Peasley was too gentlemanly to wince when 38 of Washington's
finest examples of raging testosterone showed up Monday night.
About half were muscular enough to stay, but the rest looked more
or less like veteran couch potatoes.
   After whispered consultations with Maina Gielgud, artistic
director of the Australian Ballet, Peasley politely showed the
softies to the door. Then he began drilling the winners _ including
an aerobic instructor, a government lawyer, a rock musician, a
birthday balloon delivery man and a U.S. Park Service policeman _
to whip them into shape as Roman soldiers and slaves.
   Among those who didn't make the cut were white-haired Jules
Renaud, 76, a retired Agriculture Department forestry expert who
said his bride of five months had encouraged him to try out.
``You're an attractive man,'' she had told him.
   Another who took his disappointment good-naturedly was Eugene
Woodruff, 57, of suburban Annandale, Va., a supervisor at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office whose physique suggests he's no
stranger to an evening in front of the TV set with a bag of nacho
chips.
   Woodruff has performed as an extra in several Washington Opera
productions, mostly just standing around on stage, and he was eager
to try a livelier role in ``Spartacus,'' which requires a lot of
marching and lunging and dashing here and there.
   ``I'm not a dancer at all,'' he said, grinning. ``I don't take
part in any strenuous athletics. For exercise, the only thing I do
is rifle shooting. I also mow the lawn and saw some firewood.''
   As Woodruff walked out the door, Peasley was barking ``left,
right, left, right'' to the 19 finalists as they marched across the
floor to piano music from Aram Khachaturian's score.
   Grabbing a wooden spear, Peasley said, ``These are held like you
hold a thermometer. Grasp them in the center and keep them under
your armpit, like this.''
   He taught the neophyte gladiators how to sway without getting
dizzy, and how to crouch without ``looking like you're sitting on
the toilet.''
   He held a Roman warrior's shield to his chest. ``You must be
careful how you hold a shield or they begin to look like a
handbag,'' he said.
   The extras, or supernumeraries, will receive $28 for four
rehearsals and $40 for four performances of ``Spartacus'' starting
Friday. The pay is somewhat higher than the usual rate for opera
``supers'' because of the ballet's complex stage movements.
   The money wasn't the lure for Woodruff.
   ``I have no illusions about being a great actor,'' he said. ``I
do it for the fun of it. It's a chance to do theater that's
big-time, without having any real professional skills.''

   A letter received Tuesday and signed
by West Germany's most notorious terrorist group said the attack
last week on a government official was the start of a ``long
fighting phase.''
   The letter threatened more attacks and urged terrorism groups to
build ``a revolutionary hostile power in Western Europe'' to combat
``imperialism'' led by West Germany. It was signed ``Red Army
Faction'' and dated July 29, the day after a car bomb attack on
Interior Ministry official Hans Neusel.
   The group claimed responsibility for that attack in a letter
left at the scene of the crime.
   Neusel walked away with minor cuts after a bomb rocked his sedan
as he was driving to work. The latest letter said the bomb was
meant to guarantee his ``certain death'' but ``we calculated the
amount of explosives too low.''
   The attack on Neusel was the ``start of a long fighting phase
against the newly arisen Greater German-West European World
Power,'' it said.
   The communique went on to denounce the process of German
unification and vowed support for leftist terrorists in Spain.
   It further demanded that jailed leftist terrorists in Spain and
across Western Europe be held together in common cells, rather than
separated from each other.
   The Red Army Faction has frequently demanded its jailed members
in West Germany be held together in common prison areas. West
German officials have refused.
   The five-page letter, written in German, did not contain the
gang's symbol of a star superimposed by an assault rifle. The group
has often used the symbol on previous written claims of
responsibility.
   However, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe said the
letter appeared to be authentic.
   Spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster noted that a similar letter was
sent to news agencies several days after the assassination of
Deutsche Bank President Alfred Herrhausen, who died in a November
1989 car bombing similar to the attack on Neusel.

   While the U.S. secretary of state
and the Soviet foreign minister try Wednesday to bring peace to
Afghanistan, Soviet veterans scarred by the Afghan war will be
undergoing therapy nearby.
   Some of the 1 million Soviets who fought during the Red Army's
nine-year intervention in Afghanistan are being treated at the
Baikal Sanitorium, a 192-acre health resort overlooking Lake Baikal.
   The hilltop retreat, set among cedars and birch trees, is best
known as the intended site of a 1960 superpower summit between
Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev and President Dwight D.
Eisenhower. The summit was scrapped after the downing of American
Gary Powers' spy plane.
   Three decades later, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will be meeting in
the central Siberian city of Irkutsk, 43 miles to the northwest.
They will try to agree on a formula for a cease-fire and a
political reconciliation in Afghanistan, where Moslem rebels have
been fighting the Soviet-backed government for 12 years.
   The sanitorium is one of eight nationwide treating Soviet
veterans of the war that Baker and Shevardnadze will try to end.
   Capt. Anatoly Sadayev is still tormented physically and
emotionally by the machine-gun attack that put a bullet in his leg
while he served in Afghanistan from 1983 to 1985.
   ``I remember it as though it were yesterday, but I don't want to
recall it again,'' the 34-year-old officer said Tuesday as he
pedaled an exercise bicycle.
   Sadayev has undergone several operations on his leg and is
receiving further treatment during a 24-day stay at the sanitorium.
Trousers hide the scar, but he walks with a limp. A fixed pad on
the bottom of his left sneaker helps him walk.
   In another room, a 24-year-old veteran was being treated for
lower back pain. Medicated cloth patches were placed on his back.
   Aside from treatment of their physical wounds, the veterans also
see psychologists at the center.
   Like some American veterans of the Vietnam War, some Soviet
soldiers who fought in Afghanistan feel their countrymen do not
appreciate their suffering. Sadayev is one of them.
   ``If you remember the film `Rambo,' where he says `I love my
motherland,' well let my homeland love me as much as I love it, and
then there won't be any problems,'' Sadayev said.
   Among the problems, veterans say, are the government's slowness
in providing free medical care, counseling, proper housing and jobs.
   The Soviets began withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan in
May 1988 but did not decide until October 1988 to set up
rehabilitation centers. The Baikal Sanitorium was opened to
veterans in March 1989.
   Sanitorium doctors have complained they are virtually cut off
from foreign colleagues and therefore cannot learn from their
experiences, especially from doctors treating Vietnam War veterans.
They have no detailed, specialized programs for treating soldiers,
who are mixed with other guests at the sprawling complex.
   ``Our task is to do everything so they and their families live
normally, so they have everything, because they weren't guilty for
that war and didn't want to be there,'' said Dr. Alexander
Kitaisky, Baikal Sanitorium's chief doctor.
   Sadayev calls the Soviet intervention a ``mistake of history''
that cost more than 13,000 Soviet lives. But he doesn't dwell on
the past.
   ``I am happy that I am alive. I continue to live. I have a
family,'' he said. He is now studying law in the Russian city of
Kurgan.

<HEAD>Cadets Free To Quit Air Force Saturday Under New Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force freshmen who endured
six weeks of basic training will get their first chance to drop out
Saturday under a new policy to stem a rising early attrition rate.
   The new program forces freshmen to stick it out through basic
training.
   The policy at the academy since its inception in the mid-1950s
had been to allow freshmen to quit at any time. Last year, a
surprising 149 students _ 11 percent of the freshman class _ to
quit soon after arriving.
   The dropout figures led administrators to require this year's
freshmen to stay until they had completed basic training. The only
exception was for those with physical disabilities.
   Maj. Steve Daniels, director of research, said the academy
wanted freshmen to build a sense of accomplishment by completing
the rigorous basic training program. Many of those who qut early on
in past years weren't at the academy long enough to know what cadet
life is like, Daniels said.
   The class of 1994 had 1,210 men and 181 women when it entered
the academy on June 29. Twelve men and eight women have left
because of physical disabilities.
   Those who stay after Saturday will go through an acceptance
parade on Monday. Academic classes for the cadet wing begin Aug. 9.
   The U.S. Naval Academy allows its cadets to resign anytime. At
the U.S. Military Academy, cadets must stay at least four weeks.

   AFL-CIO leaders wrestling with the abortion issue
agreed today that the powerful labor federation should continue its
decade-long path of neutrality on the divisive subject.
   The Executive Council of the 14.2 million-member organization
voted not to take a position on abortion.
   ``The overwhelming view of the council was that this was a
matter of deep conscience, conviction and religion'' on the part of
union members, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said.
   Kirkland said only two or three members of the 34-member council
dissented during today's voice vote. He said the group did not
think any stance taken by the union as a whole could change the
minds of individual members.
   Three members of the council are women.
   Today's vote was to accept the recommendation of an 18-member
panel of AFL-CIO union presidents who Monday urged the full
governing council not to take sides on abortion.
   On Monday, one of the union leaders who had ben pushing a
pro-choice stand, accused colleagues of ``dragging their feet'' on
an issue crucial to luring more women and minorities into the
struggling labor movement.
   However, the union leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
also said pro-choice forces could find solace in the fact that the
resolution acknowledged ``the right of privacy and the right of
people to choose based on their own conscience.''
   ``I don't consider it a total defeat. ... It's not strong
enough, but considering the circumstances we did about as well we
could,'' the leader said. ``It's more of a standoff.''
   Leaders urging neutrality contend that the abortion issue is
just too divisive for the labor movement and a pro-choice stand
would threaten unions' organizing efforts.
   Those officials complained that abortion had nothing to do with
traditional collective bargaining issues, such as hours and pay,
but pro-choice forces noted that the AFL-CIO has gotten involved in
other social issues such as civil rights.
   There was no organized move afoot for the federation to condemn
abortion.
   However, both the National Right to Life Committee and Cardinal
John J. O'Connor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York had
campaigned for the AFL-CIO not to take a stand. They noted that a
recent Supreme Court decision gives union members the right to
withhold dues spent on political issues.
   Many union leaders interpreted that campaign as a threat by the
committee and O'Connor that they would lobby members to withhold
union dues if the AFL-CIO went pro-choice.
   A pro-choice position would have put the federation in line with
the stance taken by many of its political allies, such as the
Democratic Party and various women's and civil rights groups.
   At a convention last fall of delegates from all 90 AFL-CIO
unions, the delegates declined to adopt any of the half-dozen
pro-choice resolutions submitted, and instead referred them to the
Executive Council at its meeting last February in Bal Harbour, Fla.
   Instead of taking up the issue at that highly publicized
meeting, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland appointed the 18-member
committee to study the issue and make a recommendation at this
meeting in Chicago, where the federation is not in as bright a
spotlight.

   President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo promised
President Bush on Tuesday that he would allow the establishment of
another political party in his west African country to give his
people some democracy.
   The two leaders also discussed the rapidly deteriorating
situation in Liberia during their two-hour White House meeting,
said Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen.
   Togo has offered asylum to Liberian President Samuel Doe, who is
holding out at his palace in Monrovia against a challenge by rebels
seeking his ouster.
   But Cohen said the asylum question was not discussed at the
White House meeting. He said both leaders support a role for the
United Nations in establishing a cease-fire in Liberia.
   Eyadema, whose country is one of the poorest in the world, also
urged Bush and other friends of Africa to start a Marshall Plan for
the continent, similar to the massive Western aid program for the
newly emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   In departure statements on the White House's south lawn, Bush
said he was encouraged by Eyadema's promise to provide his people
with more political openness. Cohen said Eyadema pledged he would
do away with the one-party state and allow the Togolese another
political party so they could have more choice.
   ``The path to development and the path to democracy are one and
the same,'' Bush told Eyadema in his statement. In heavily accented
French, Bush also sent his best wishes to the people of Togo.
   Eyadema, who took power in a bloodless military coup in 1967,
runs an authoritarian state.
   The State Department's annual human rights report says that
while Togo has a serious problem of torture in its prisons, the
situation has improved under the 2-year-old Togolese Human Rights
Commission, which reports to Eyadema.
   In Eyadema's departure statement, he noted that Africa's debt
will exceed $600 billion by the year 2000 and he urged that
``appropriate remedies must be found for the grave problems of our
continent, which is the victim of famine and calamities.''
   Eyadema is here to promote Togo's newly created Export
Processing Zone, which will allow U.S. and other businessmen to
produce merchandise in the West African country and to export it to
Europe free of duty. Several U.S. government agencies are helping
the project get started.
   In his meetings, Eyadema hopes to interest American businessmen
in investing in Togo. In return they will get better access than
they enjoy here to the large market being created in Europe by the
1992 merger of the economies of the 12-nation European Economic
Community.
   Togo, twice the size of Maryland with a population of 3.3
million, has been largely dependent on agriculture since it gained
independence in 1960. Hopes of improving the economy through the
sale of phosphate in the 1970s collapsed with a drastic fall in the
world price of that commodity.
   In return for support from the International Monetary Fund, Togo
has been selling or liquidating government-controlled enterprises
and offering generous incentives to foreign investors.

   Baseball finally did to New York Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner what he'd been doing to managers for 18 years _
it showed him the door.
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday stripped
Steinbrenner of control of the team for allegedly paying a gambler
to dig up dirt on a ballplayer.
   ``For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be
treated as if he had been placed on the permanent ineligible
list,'' Vincent said. ``I hope this sad episode is now over.''
   Fans rose in a 90-second standing ovation when news spread to
Yankee Stadium. The decision brought shouts of ``No more George!''
   ``I will not comment on the decision,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm
very happy it was resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution,
and that's all I'm going to say.''
   As one of the most controversial _ some say hated _ names in the
game's history, Steinbrenner was famous for hiring and firing
managers _ five times in the case of Billy Martin. He changed
managers 18 times and pitching coaches 31 times.
   Steinbrenner, 60, who headed a group that purchased the Yankees
from CBS Inc. in 1973, can retain partial ownership but was given
six months to reduce his stake to below 50 percent from 55 percent.
His 33-year-old son, Hank, will become the new general partner,
said Steinbrenner's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman.
   Vincent said it would be possible for a member of Steinbrenner's
family to be the new general partner, but warned the family member
would face expulsion if George Steinbrenner was found to have any
involvement with the operation of the club. His son's appointment
is subject to the approval of Vincent and the other major league
teams.
   Hank Steinbrenner, the oldest of Steinbrenner's four children,
has been involved in the daily operations of the club since 1986.
Last year, he also was the head soccer coach at Vanguard High
School in Ocala, Fla., and worked breeding horses at his father's
stud farm there.
   Under the restrictions, George Steinbrenner will be allowed to
consult on major business decisions but cannot participate in
player deals. And he must get Vincent's permission, in writing, to
attend major league games as anything other than an ordinary fan.
He cannot, for example, sit in the owner's box or visit the
clubhouse.
   Also, the Yankees must certify in writing to the American League
president every six months that Steinbrenner has had no involvement
with the team.
   Steinbrenner accepted the terms of his punishment and agreed not
to contest the decision in court, as he had threatened to do,
Vincent said.
   ``It's sad,'' said Yankee pitcher Dave Righetti. ``He really
loved the idea of owning the Yankees, and now it's been taken away
from him.''
   ``The guy got exactly what he deserved,'' a Yankee fan, Trevor
Bickford of Westbury, N.Y., said after word reached Yankee Stadium.
``That's what should happen to any owner that constantly makes
decisions to hurt the club.''
   Vincent punished Steinbrenner for starting a relationship with
gambler Howard Spira and paying Spira $40,000 in January. Vincent
said Steinbrenner's actions violated the ``best interests of
baseball'' clause that gives the commissioner practically unlimited
powers to protect the integrity of the game.
   Last August, Pete Rose was banished from the game for betting on
baseball.
   Steinbrenner's downfall stemmed from a feud with Yankee Dave
Winfield, whom he signed in 1980. Steinbrenner turned on his star
outfielder after Winfield went 1-for-22 in the 1981 World Series
loss to Los Angeles.
   Winfield and Steinbrenner sued each other three times in the
1980s and Winfield finally was traded to the California Angels in
May.
   That deal came after Spira said he was paid by Steinbrenner to
provide information to discredit the outfielder. Spira went public
with the $40,000 payment in March and Vincent started the
investigation.
   ``Mr. Steinbrenner has offered multiple and conflicting
explanations of his decision to give $40,000 to Spira, ranging from
charity to extortion,'' Vincent said.
   ``I am pursuaded that neither extreme was at work here. Rather,
the payment was in consideration for Spira's help ....''
   Steinbrenner tried to cover up the $40,000 because ``he knew the
payment, if exposed, would look bad, and he knew, or at least
should have known, that if the payment were exposed, it would bring
disrepute to him and therefore to baseball,'' the commissioner said.
   Steinbrenner is the only owner to be penalized twice for major
offenses. He was suspended in 1974 by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for
making illegal campaign contributions to President Nixon. The
two-year exile was reduced to 15 months.
   ``I have nothing to say,'' Spira said after the announcement.
   Winfield got the news during an Angels game with the Twins in
Minneapolis.
   ``I felt quite a bit vindicated because so much had been said
about me. I had so many battles, so much turmoil,'' Winfield said.
``I'm glad to get a lot of this out of the way. ... 
supplement its drought-reduced domestic vegetable oil supply.
   In addition to higher cash prices for soybeans, analysts said
relatively few delivery notices were posted Tuesday at the Board of
Trade.
   Tuesday was the first opportunity for traders to declare their
intent to deliver soybeans against the August contract. A low
number of notices indicates strong cash-market demand.
   John Frazier, director of agricultural commodity trading with
Gerald Inc. in Chicago, said Continental Grain Co. was the only
major commercial grain handler to post soybean delivery notices
Tuesday.
   Frazier said the wheat market fell sharply just before the
close, apparently on heavy selling by a speculative fund.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 7{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.90 a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 1 cent lower with September at $2.60\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 2 cents higher with September at $1.30 a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with August at $5.94 a
bushel.

<HEAD>100,000 Troops Massed on Iraq-Kuwait Border as Talks Begin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators
embraced warmly Tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border
dispute, sources said. Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed
100,000 troops on Kuwait's border.
   Gulf-based diplomatic sources said the Iraqi force, triple the
number earlier reported, included about 300 Soviet-made tanks, and
dwarfed the entire Kuwaiti army of 20,000 troops.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
troops have been concentrated along the border since last week,
when Iraq began threatening Kuwait. Iraq accused the small Persian
Gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and
forcing oil prices to drop. The diplomats said the number of troops
was at first difficult to determine.
   The delegation leaders, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik
Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait, and Izzat Ibrahim, deputy
chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, met privately for
two hours.
   There were no details on the negotiations, but sources said the
meetings will continue Wednesday.
   Diplomatic sources have said they expect Arab mediators to push
the two sides to sign a treaty of non-belligerency to be followed
by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation.
   The Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out on July 17 when Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of
driving down oil prices by exceeding quotas set for them by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saddam said the move
cost Iraq $14 billion in lost revenue.
   Saddam also demanded compensation for the $2.4 billion in oil he
claimed Kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddles
the unmarked border between the two countries.
   Iraq also demanded that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loans it
extended to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq's tough talk appeared to have succeeded. Kuwait and the
U.A.E agreed to stick to their oil quotas at an OPEC meeting last
week. OPEC member states also agreed to a longstanding Iraqi demand
to raised target crude oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel.
   Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials agreed to meet in Jiddah after
intensive mediation efforts by King Fahd and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   Kuwaiti leaders had insisted that Iraq pull back its troops
before conciliation talks could began, but later dropped that
demand.
   Kuwaiti officials also asked that Iraq agree to demarcate the
disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq has refused.
   Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait and has long
coveted the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which command
access to Iraq's sole outlet into the Persian Gulf.
   The mediators have succeeded in toning down a vitriolic campaign
against Kuwait by the Iraqi state-run media.
   On Tuesday, the Iraqi delegation left Baghdad without any public
announcement.
   The leading Al-Thawra daily newspaper called the Jiddah meeting
``an opportunity ... for Kuwait ... to perceive Iraq's demands and
respond to its rights.''
   In contrast, the Kuwaiti delegation left for Jiddah with fanfare
and publicity.
   The Kuwaiti papers said they hoped the Jiddah meeting was the
start of ``a final just settlement'' of the differences between
Iraq and Kuwait, in a manner ensuring the ``legitimate rights of
each.''

<HEAD>Refugee Loan Proposals Receive Mixed Reviews</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans working with refugees expressed
mixed reactions Tuesday to congressional proposals to lend money to
immigrants so they can establish themselves without going on
welfare.
   The author of one measure, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said his
plan would establish a federal program of refugee loan guarantees
to encourage private lenders to give loans to employable refugees.
   Solarz said at a House hearing on resettlement that his goal was
to make ``optimum use'' of scarce refugee resettlement dollars so
that more victims of persecution and oppression can come to the
United States.
   The Solarz plan calls for qualifying refugees to receive an
average loan of $7,500 to be repaid over a decade. Even if the
default rate were 30 percent, Solarz said that his estimates
``suggest that the refugee program might save as much as tens of
millions of dollars per year.''
   Another proposal from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, would give
some refugees interest-free loans to cover half the average cost of
resettlement. The refugees would be required to repay the loans.
   Nicolas Dimarzio, executive director of the U.S. Catholic
Conference's Migration and Refugee Services, said the group could
not endorse private sponsorship proposals right now because it
didn't know enough about them.
   ``We are concerned that, while both of these approaches seek to
eventually reduce federal outlays for refugees, neither ensures
that these programs would result in an increase of refugee
admissions to the United States,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said, he could not be sure the proposals would be
equitable.
   Gary Rubin of the American Jewish Committee, a group that
promotes the rights of Jews around the world, refused to endorse
the proposals and said more study is needed.
   ``It will obviously be a very complex task to set up a workable
program...,' Rubin said. ``The proposed legislation does not yet
take all of these factors into account.''
   Private sponsorship initiatives are expected to allow about
15,000 refugees, primarily those from the Soviet Union and Cuba, to
find new lives in the United States this year.
   There are some 15 million refugees around the world, and many
are eager to come to the United States for a new life. About
125,000 refugees will settle in the United States in 1990, at a
total cost of about $600 million.

<HEAD>Kohl to Tell East Germany to Limit Weapons Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl will urge East
Germany to spend ``as little as possible'' on new weapons,
following revelations East Berlin plans a huge new purchase of
Soviet arms, officials said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, East German Labor Minister Regine Hildebrandt pleaded
for an emergency infusion of West German aid. East Germany ``stands
before a social and financial collapse'' if new aid doesn't come
soon, Ms. Hildebrandt said.
   Kohl's government has resisted East German requests for aid to
supplement the sums Bonn is already spending to lay the economic
and social groundwork for unity. West Germany contends East Berlin
could do much more belt-tightening.
   Such contentions intensified after the East German government
admitted late Monday that it plans to spend $622 million on new
Soviet-made weapons. The purchases were revealed earlier in West
German media reports.
   Kohl has been under intense pressure to scuttle East Germany's
arms-buying plans. On Tuesday, the chancellor and his coalition
partners agreed to tell East Germany to ``procure as few weapons as
possible,'' a government official said on condition of anonymity.
   It was not known when Kohl would address the issue with the East
Berlin government or whether he would suggest a monetary limit.
   West Germany's education minister, Juergen Moellemann of the
liberal Free Democratic Party, had demanded the purchases be
blocked.
   The weapons-purchasing plans have put East German Defense
Minister Rainer Eppelmann _ a pastor and avowed pacifist _ in an
uncomfortable media spotlight.
   He says he is proceding with the purchases only because
contracts were signed, some eight years ago. Eppelmann said that
backing away from purchases would mean paying considerable
financial penalties to the Soviets.
   But several West German politicians say the purchases are a
waste of money, since the East German army will likely be disbanded
by the year's end.
   Many West Germans are already worried that the high costs of
unification will lead to financial sacrifices and higher taxes, and
oppose extra expenditures by the financially beleaguered government
in East Berlin.
   Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, a high-ranking member of West Germany's
main opposition Social Democratic Party, called the
weapons-purchasing plans a ``security and financial scandal.''
   She also said the West German government has long known about
the weapons procurements but did nothing to stop them.
   On Monday night, East German officials acknowledged the
government planned to buy the Soviet military hardware over the
next six months. The weapons include two missile-carrying vessels,
anti-tank rockets, a helicopter, and machine guns, West German news
media have reported.
   East Germany was also close to buying 32 MiG-29 fighter jets
worth $628 million but that plan was scuttled when the West German
Defense Ministry said it would have no use for the Soviet-made
airplanes, reports said.
   Meanwhile, pressure mounted on West Germany to free more
financial aid for East Germany.
   The East German labor minister said she feared the spiraling
unemployment following the July 1 economic unification of the
German states would breed social unrest.
   ``If something doesn't happen soon then much will collapse which
should not be allowed to collapse,'' Ms. Hildebrandt said.
   More than 250,000 East Germans have lost their jobs as companies
and factories try to survive the country's switch to capitalism.
Some experts say joblessness could climb to 3 million.
   As the two Germanys bicker over money, progress seems to have
been made in efforts to forge a new treaty setting out the
technicalities for Dec. 2 elections for an all-German Parliament.

   The United States is preparing
emergency assistance for this beleaguered Caribbean country, but
there are no plans to send military reinforcements, the U.S.
ambassador said Tuesday.
   ``We haven't been asked and we aren't considering any type of
military support,'' Ambassador Charles Gargano said at the U.S.
Embassy, a few blocks from the state Television House where a
radical Moslem group has held hostages since Friday.
   The group also seized the Parliament House and is holding
hostages there, including government officials. Prime Minister
Arthur N.R. Robinson was freed Tuesday, five days after being
seized, the attorney general said.
   Because of widespread looting, Trinidad could face food
shortages, and the United States is preparing emergency supplies,
Gargano said.
   He said a force of some 200 Caribbean soldiers were standing by
on Barbados to help if requested.
   The ambassador, who has been staying in the Embassy along with
12 other diplomatic personnel and six Marine guards, said he is in
regular contact with Trinidadian officials.
   He said there are no signs of splintering in the government or
security forces, and there is no popular support for the rebels.
   ``The government is in total control of the country,'' he said.
   Gargano, named in 1987, said the crisis ``came out of the blue
for us. In fact, we were quite shocked. This country appeared to be
a model of democracy.''
   The U.S. stakes here are high, he said. He said there are 2,000
to 4,000 U.S. citizens in Trinidad, including many Trinidadians who
hold dual citizenship.
   Trinidad is a major U.S. trade partner in the Caribbean and has
been a pro-American democracy for its three decades of nationhood,
he said.
   ``Things have been moving apace in terms of democratization in
this hemisphere. We would like to see it continue as a strong
democracy,'' Gargano said.
   He said the Moslem group led by former Trinidad policeman Abu
Bakr has been controversial in Trinidad and has made anti-American
statements.
   ``Our impression is that it was a tiny fanatical sect,'' he
said, estimating Bakr's followers at 250 to 350 people.
   He said some members of the group have traveled to Libya and
``there is some evidence of training given to some members.'' He
said they also have received funding from Libya. But Gargano added
there was no evidence of Libyan involvement in their move against
the government.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson was freed by his Moslem captors today but other officials
held hostage were not released, the government announced.
   Attorney General Anthony Smart gave no details of how and under
what conditions the prime minister, who had been shot in both feet
during the uprising, was freed. But the release of Robinson alone
indicated the 5-day-old standoff between the government and Moslem
extremists was not over.
   ``We continue to pray for the safe return of the rest of the
hostages,'' Smart told state radio.
   He said Robinson was the only one of the 41 hostages released.
   Smart said Robinson, who was freed at 1:20 p.m. EDT, ``is in
good spirits.''
   The siege began Friday when radical Moslems led by Abu Bakr
stormed Parliament and the government-run television station in
Trinidad's capital city. Bakr has accused the government of
mismanagement.
   The release came after a day of conflicting reports over the
progress of negotiations to end the hostage siege, which has
plunged this Caribbean nation of 1.3 million residents off
northeast Venezuela into chaos.
   On Monday night, Robinson had said by telephone that he had
accepted an agreement under which he would resign and Bakr and his
men would be granted amnesty.
   But government officials said today that no such agreement
existed and that Robinson had made the statement under duress.
   Bakr said earlier today that the rebels agreed that Winston
Dookeran, the deputy prime minister, would replace Robinson when he
steps down. Dookeran was released from the Parliament building
Friday.
   The interim government would be a coalition consisting of
representatives of all major political parties, along with Bakr's
Jamaat al-Muslimeen group.
   The group, which is believed to number 250 to 300, has blamed
Robinson for widespread poverty in this once-oil rich Caribbean
nation near Venezuela. It has little support among the populace.
   Bakr is a former policeman who converted to Islam in 1980 and
has long considered himself a champion of the downtrodden. He
founde Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic,
in 1984.
   Robinson easily won parliamentary elections in 1986. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until 1991.
   On Monday, security forces exchanged gunfire with the rebels at
Parliament and at the government television station. Three
buildings in and around the TV complex were set ablaze but no
injuries were reported.
   At least nine people _ six rebels, two police officers and a
civilian _ have been killed since the siege began, and the
instability has spawned massive looting in Trinidad and Tobago, a
two-island nation of 1.3 million people. State radio said some
looters were shot Monday but gave no details.
   Bakr has ties to Libya and it is believed he has received
funding from that country. In a conversation with local radio
today, he said he had no regrets over what he had done.
   ``I hope we can settle it in love,'' he said.
   Asked if the siege could end in violence, he said, ``Everyone
will die at some time in their lives.''

<HEAD>US Weighs Asking For UN Peacekeeping Force For Liberia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As fighting raged near the U.S. Embassy in
Monrovia, the Bush administration said Tuesday it may call for a
U.N. peacekeeping force to bring an end to the seven-month old
conflict in Liberia.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said there
were no plans to evacuate the 400 Americans remaining in Liberia
despite a deterioration in the security situation. A U.S. naval
flotilla was waiting offshore in case evacuation is required.
   Boucher said there was intensive fighting that apparently left
rebels in control of an area where the U.S. Embassy is located.
Rocket fire was reported in that area on Tuesday but only one
building was said to have been damaged.
   According to the latest reports, fighting was continuing but at
less intensive levels than Monday. Boucher said U.S. officials have
been in contact with rebel and government forces and both have
indicated a willingness to abide by American admonitions to respect
foreign embassies.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said bullets
ricocheted off several U.S. buildings at the height of the fighting
around the diplomatic enclave, but no one was hurt.
   ``None of the combatants have targeted our people,'' he said.
   The administration was facing additional pressure on Tuesday to
intensify diplomatic efforts toward a peaceful solution. That
pressure increased following a massacre over the weekend in which
forces loyal to President Samuel K. Doe broke into a Lutheran
church and killed hundreds of civilian refugees.
   Cohen said the rebels also were committing atrocities and the
United States has reliable information that they were executing any
government soldiers they capture.
   Boucher acknowledged that previous U.S. diplomatic efforts have
not borne fruit.
   ``We're now examining what role the United Nations can play in
resolution of this conflict,'' he said. ``Our ambassador to the
United Nations has begun consultations in this regard. We have also
heard from other quarters that there is possible interest in U.N.
Security Council action.''
   Cohen, briefing reporters at the White House, said the United
States supports the formation of an international peacekeeping
force.
   Even if Doe is dislodged from power, peace would not necessarily
be assured because of a split in the rebel forces, Cohen said.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said Congress has
been urging the administration to put Liberia on the U.N. Security
Council's agenda and to take a more active role in removing Doe
from the scene.
   ``Our concern is to try to reduce the volatility ... stop
large-scale ethnic tensions,'' said Wolpe.
   The administration is concerned not only about the Americans in
Liberia but also the estimated 37,000 Liberians who have sought
refuge at U.S. installations in Liberia. Cohen said the United
States could not offer them food because it has barely enough for
U.S. personnel.
   U.S. officials have promised to evacuate Soviet diplomats and
envoys from some allied countries in the event the fighting
continues to escalate.

   A skydiver who survived a fall of nearly
10,000 feet with a partially opened parachute said he felt like an
angel was looking out for him.
   Mike Butela, 30, was released Tuesday from
Presbyterian-University Hospital after being treated for two broken
vertebrae.
   ``I thought I was dead,'' Butela said. ``I had 10 seconds there
to think about it, and it wasn't a real good feeling.''
   Butela, who has been skydiving for seven years, said he knew he
was in trouble Friday when he opened his main parachute at about
3,000 feet and one of the lines got caught, causing him to spiral
downward. He jumped at about 9,500 feet above the ground.
   He opened the reserve chute, but the chutes tangled and he could
not free them. He said he fell with his main chute only one-fourth
open before landing in a cornfield in Worthington, about 35 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh.
   ``It was like an angel let me down,'' Butela said.
   Butela said he plans to jump again as soon as his back heals.

<HEAD>Motorists To Begin Paying Biggest Tax Hike In State History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists who clog California's
freeways on Wednesday begin paying the state's biggest tax hike
ever, a voter-approved nickel-a-gallon levy on fuel aimed at
reducing the highway gridlock.
   ``This nickel is adding insult on top of injury,'' said Dennis
Radabaugh, a Contra Costa sheriff's deputy who lives in Walnut
Creek. He said the increase was ``one of several nickels that's
obviously going to raise my whole cost of living.''
   The tax rises an additional cent Jan. 1, then one more penny
each subsequent New Year's Day through 1994. That will provide the
majority of funding for an $18 billion-plus, 10-year highway and
mass-transit rail construction program that voters approved June 5
in the form of Proposition 111.
   Altogether, the average California motorist will soon be paying
more than a cent per mile in excise and sales taxes.
   Road and rail construction has not kept pace with population
because of inflation and political paralysis on the issue. Drivers
waste more than 400,000 hours a day because the average speed on
urban freeways has fallen to about 20 mph during commuting hours.
   In the next decade, the number of licensed drivers is expected
to rise 18 percent. Currently there are about 19 million registered
drivers in California, and some 25 million vehicles.
   The new levies will double the current state excise tax per
gallon of gas from 9 to 18 cents. There already is a federal excise
tax of 9.1 cents per gallon and a sales tax per $1 of 6.25 to 7.25
cents, depending on how much the county tacks on above the state's
basic 6.25 cents.
   The state excise tax also will go up at the same rate on diesel,
aviation fuel for light airplanes, and marine gasoline.
   But drastic as that may seem to Californians, the state's gas
tax after the initial nickel hike will rank 37th among states and
12th after the full increase goes into effect, up from 47th, said
Penny Hill, a spokeswoman for the Road Information Program, a
Washington-based nonprofit research organization.
   State excise taxes on gas range from 22.3 cents per gallon in
Nebraska to 7.5 cents a gallon in Georgia, she said.
   Proposition 111 was supported by a bipartisan government,
business and labor coalition.
   It was rejected by rural voters, who believed they would benefit
less than cities despite plans to distribute funds throughout the
state.
   But there was no organized opposition and the scattered critics,
for the most part, see the tax as unfortunate but necessary.
   ``Service stations owners are not happy about the gas tax. We're
usually opposed to any tax increase, but we know this one was
designated for transportation improvements,'' said Art Boswell, a
spokesman for the California Service Station and Automotive Repair
Association.
   State officials said they believe motorists will take the tax
hike in stride. Everyone, they said, is used to fluctuations in gas
prices, which are also expected to rise because of increases in the
cost of crude oil.
   Some service station attendants in San Francisco, Los Angeles,
San Bernardino and Sacramento said it was business as usual Tuesday
while others said sales were up to 25 percent brisker as people
stocked up before the price went up. A few stations said they ran
out of gas early because of the increased business.
   ``I saved a dollar,'' said Bill Morris of Concord, who filled up
the 28-gallon tank of his 1969 Oldsmobile to avoid the tax hike. He
owns four cars but prefers the old 10-mile-a-gallon guzzler.
   Not everyone was so concerned.
   ``Customers aren't too worried about it. When you've got a BMW
you don't worry if it costs $3 more to fill up the tank,'' said
Jeffrey Masko, a service station cashier in the high-rent Pacific
Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.

   Republican newspaper ads blaming Democrats
for the savings and loan crisis triggered outrage among Democratic
governors Tuesday as the National Governors' Association ended its
annual meeting with a round of partisan finger-pointing.
   Democratic governors approved a resolution among themselves
calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate
the S&amp;L debacle and charging that the Bush administration ``has
moved slowly to prosecute'' S&amp;L fraud.
   It went beyond a policy statement approved later by the full
governors' association _ Democrats and Republicans _ calling on
President Bush and Congress to name an independent commission to
investigate the savings and loan collapse. The S&amp;L bailout is
expected to cost taxpayers as much as $500 billion.
   The governors accepted a Republican amendment offered by Gov.
James Martin of North Carolina that softened the statement's
language a bit to say the commission should not delay action on the
S&amp;L crisis and should have no power to grant immunity from
prosecution for witnesses.
   Democratic governors were quick to denounce newspaper ads
sponsored by the Republican National Committee that blamed
congressional Democrats for the S&amp;L debacle. The ads ran in the
Mobile Register on Monday and Tuesday.
   One of the ads pictured 12 congressional Democrats, including
resigned House Speaker Jim Wright and Sens. Alan Cranston of
California and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. It said, ``You won't see
these Democratic `leaders' around Mobile,'' and ``They're the guys
who let the S&amp;L problem explode into a $325 billion national
crisis.''
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, chairman of the Democratic governors,
called the ads ``deceitful'' and ``the most outrageous distortion
of the truth.'' He blamed Republicans for upsetting the normal
spirit of bipartisanship at the governors' conference and said the
Bush administration has failed provide leadership on the S&amp;L crisis.
   In the governors' final bipartisan meeting, Democratic Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts _ the defeated 1988 presidential
nominee _ called the ads ``garbage'' and said, ``We had enough of
that in 1988.''
   The ads were regarded by Democrats as an escalation in the
growing partisan rancor over the S&amp;L crisis as the fall elections
approach. And it represented the most biting partisan dispute to
erupt at a national governors' meeting in half a dozen years.
   Republican Gov. John McKernan of Maine said Democrats have been
trying to use the S&amp;L crisis as a political issue.
   ``Republicans want to make sure people realize there's enough
blame to go around,' McKernan said.
   Democratic National Chairman Ronald Brown, in Mobile for the
governors' meeting, said the ads were a sign of ``absolute panic''
by Republicans over the S&amp;L debacle. He compared it to Bush's use
of Willie Horton, the felon who attacked a Maryland couple while on
furlough from a Massachusetts prison, against Dukakis in 1988.
   ``They're kind of Willie Hortonizing the S&amp;L issue,'' Brown said.
   Celeste said, ``If there's a Willie Horton in the S&amp;L crisis,
it's Neil Bush.'' That was a reference to the president's son, who
is charged with violating conflict of interest regulations while he
was on the board of a Colorado savings and loan.
   Some Republicans criticized the ads' timing during the
conference. James Thompson of Illinois said the ads ``have no place
at this conference.''
   Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, head of the Republican
governors, tried to smooth over the partisan differences when
meeting with his Democratic colleagues, saying ``There's enough
blame to go around'' on the S&amp;L collapse.
   But in an interview, Campbell angrily blamed Brown's appearance
in Mobile Monday on behalf of the Democratic candidate for governor
of Alabama, Paul Hubbert, and Brown's remarks critical of host Gov.
Guy Hunt, the state's first-ever Republican governor who is locked
in a tight re-election race.
   Campbell said Brown's remarks and appearance showed ``a total
lack of class'' and ``opened the door'' to the GOP attack ads.
   Mark Gearan, director of the Democratic Governors' Association,
dismissed Campbell's remarks, saying the first ad was purchased
before Brown's arrival.
   Democrats also pointed the finger at new Republican National
Committee chief spokesman Charles Black. At the RNC, spokeswoman
Leslie Goodman dismissed Democratic complaints and defended the ads.
   ``Any time a bunch of Democrats get together in the same place
there is a propensity for a lot of hot air and distortion of the
facts,'' she said. ``We just want to keep giving our subtle
reminders of their culpability.''
   The call for an independent commission came on a near-unanimous
voice vote, despite White House comments on Monday that Bush would
ignore the request.
   The governors adjourned after a final session where Washington
state Gov. Booth Gardner, a Democrat, was installed as the new
chairman, and Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican, was
named vice chairman.
   In party caucuses, Democrats selected Colorado's Roy Romer and
Mississippi's Ray Mabus as chairman and vice chairman of their
Democratic Governors' Association.

<TEXT>
   A man who spent eight years in prison for
raping a teen-ager and chopping off her forearms was sentenced
Tuesday to 60 days in jail for stealing a disposable camera.
   Lawrence Singleton changed his plea from innocent to no contest
on the misdemeanor petty-theft charge.
   ``I don't think I can get a fair trial. I never have.'' said
Singleton, 62, who was chased out of several California towns after
his highly publicized 1987 release.
   A security guard in a suburban Brandon drug store spotted
Singleton taking a $10 camera from a display on April 8 and heading
for the door with it tucked under his arm.
   Hillsborough County Judge Debra Behnke imposed the maximum
sentence after the prosecutor argued that the convicted rapist's
criminal record left no other choice.
   Singleton was jailed Tuesday at the Hillsborough County Jail.
   He was convicted of raping 15-year-old runaway Mary Vincent,
cutting off her forearms with an ax and then leaving her for dead
in a ditch along a central California roadside in 1978.
   To much public protest, Singleton was freed in 1987 after
serving eight years and four months of a 14-year sentence.
   During his one-year parole, prison authorities shuttled
Singleton from city to city in California, but protests followed
his every move.
   Singleton's home state of Florida and the state of Nevada, where
he maintained a home, both refused to take him. Singleton ended up
living in a mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin Prison until
his parole ended in 1988.
   His arrival at the home of relatives in Tampa in June of that
year sparked community protest and a bomb threat, and he left after
a few months, returning to California. It wasn't publicly known he
was back in Florida until the shoplifting arrest.

<HEAD>Communists Win Elections, Invite Opposition to Join Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party won a wide
majority in the nation's first free legislative elections and
invited opposition parties to join the cabinet, the party chairman
said Tuesday.
   A preliminary count of Sunday's election returns indicated the
Communists won about 60 percent of the 53 seats in the Small Hural,
one chamber of parliament, said Hurmetbek, vice chairman of the
National Election Commission. Like many Mongolians, he uses a
single name.
   The preliminary count also indicated that the Communists won at
least 343 seats in the Great Hural.
   Hurmetbek said new elections may be required for 28 Great Hural
seats. He said there were legal errors in three or four races, and
in the other cases neither candidate received ballots from a
majority of eligible voters. Many voters apparently did not know
how to mark the ballots because it was the first time they had to
choose between candidates.
   A Communist victory had been guaranteed in the elections in this
Soviet-bloc country because the five new opposition parties lacked
the time to put up candidates for each seat.
   The Small Hural will meet between the Great Hural's near-annual
sessions and will draft legislation and make day-to-day decisions.
   ``From the results, we could see that the Mongolian people have
great trust in the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party,'' party
leader Gombojavyn Ochirbat told a news conference, using the formal
name of the Communist Party.
   But he also said the Communists were ready to open talks with
the opposition and give them an unspecified number of seats in the
new Cabinet.
   ``We believe that in the new government ... new political
parties should be represented,'' Ochirbat said. He said no date had
been set to start talks with the opposition, but ``they know about
it, that we are ready to negotiate.''
   He said the participation of opposition parties ``will be vital
for political stability and national unity.''
   He said the government's first steps should be to make the
election law more democratic, and to revise the constitution and
other laws to protect the media and religion.
   Mass protests and a hunger strike by pro-democracy demonstrators
last winter and spring forced the Communists to legalize opposition
parties and agree to elections after decades of authoritarian rule.
   Batbayar, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party,
said the opposition's gain of about 40 percent of the seats in the
Small Hural was a victory.
   ``For a long time our people were under the exploitation of
communism,'' he said. ``Now we are just coming from the darkness
into a bright future. We think that anyway this election was the
end of orthodox Communism in Mongolia.''
   But opposition parties have also said the balloting was not a
true measure of the popular will.
   The parties were legalized in May, after the nominating process
had begun. More weight was given to rural votes, which tended to
favor the Communists. Some opposition activists said local
Communist officials intimidated rural voters into supporting them.
   The Communists have ruled this remote, Central Asian nation of 2
million people since 1921, making it the world's second-oldest
Communist state after the Soviet Union.
   Ochirbat maintained that the Communists are committed to the
same reforms as the opposition parties, including replacing state
economic planning with a market-style economy. The government
tentatively plans to begin freeing price controls for non-essential
goods in January.

<HEAD>September Start Date Set for Databank of Bad Doctors and Dentists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

   A computerized databank of actions taken
against incompetent physicians and dentists will open its
electronic doors Sept. 1, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan said Tuesday.
   The National Practitioner Databank is intended to prevent
physicians and dentists who have been disciplined from moving to
another state and setting up new practices without detection, he
said.
   The databank will store reports of malpractice actions,
licensure disciplinary actions by state medical and dental boards
and actions by professional societies, hospitals and other health
care entities after a formal peer review process.
   The reports must be made beginning Sept. 1. Actions taken before
then do not have to be reported.
   Hospitals will be required to check the databank when a
physician or dentist applies to join the medical staff or receive
clinical privileges, Sullivan said.
   Also, hospitals will be required to check the databank every two
years concerning physicians and dentists on their medical staffs or
those who have clinical privileges.
   State licensing boards also will have access to the information,
and individual physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals will be able to see their own records. Attorneys
representing a physician or dentist may have access under limited
conditions.
   Charges for use of the databank will be $2 per name for each
request. However, individual practitioners will not be charged for
seeing his or her own file.
   The Ralph Nader-founded group Public Citizen has been critical
of the data bank because members of the public will not have access
to the information and retroactive reporting will not be required.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group recently put out its
own information in a book called ``The 6,892 Questionable Doctors
Disciplined by States or the Federal Government.'' It lists the
names of physicians and dentists who have been disciplined.

   Police said three suspects showed no remorse
Tuesday when they were charged with murdering a 9-month-old boy by
blindly firing through a door to settle a dispute with the infant's
uncle.
   An angry Mayor David Dinkins, questioned about the fourth
slaying of a child in the city in eight days, asserted that the
random violence does not mean the city ``is out of control.''
   ``This is not Dodge City,'' he declared.
   Gunmen went to an apartment in the Bronx on Monday and fired
repeatedly through the door. ``Behind that door, Rayvon Jamison sat
in a child's walker and was struck by at least one of those
shots,'' said Police Commissioner Lee Brown.
   Brown said the three suspects under arrest were trying to gun
down the infant's uncle, Joseph Jamison.
   ``He was the object of the shooting. The child was the victim of
the senseless violence,'' said Brown.
   Jamison and eight others _ including the victim's mother and
grandmother _ were inside the apartment when the baby was shot.
   Jamison, 29, had chastised one of the suspects last Thursday for
a throwing a bottle, and animosity had escalated over the weekend,
Brown said.
   The petty nature of the dispute ``adds to the tragedy of this
shooting,'' Brown said. ``It also gives a clear message that the
value or the sanctity of life means little to someone who has easy
access to weapons.''
   ``No remorse was shown by the three men'' when they learned of
the child's death, said police Detective Ellen Hale.
   The suspects were charged with second-degree murder, criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, and reckless endangerment, Brown
said.
   The three previous slayings of children all occurred in the
borough of Brooklyn. Veronica Corales, 9, was killed while sleeping
in her parent's car; 3-year-old Ben Williams died in his sleep when
18 bullets were fired through the front door of his home; and
1-year-old Yaritimi Fruto was fatally wounded by a gunman who also
killed her father.
   The rash of killings has put Dinkins under pressure, and the
mayor reacted angrily to reporters who questioned his election-year
pledge to become the toughest mayor on crime in city history.
   ``There is law and order. Things are not out of control and this
is not Dodge City,'' said Dinkins. ``One cannot guard against the
kind of random violence that occurred when they shot in these doors
and took the lives of children.''
   Despite Dinkins' assertion, the city is on its way to a record
number of homicides for the third straight year. If projections
hold up, last year's all-time high of 1,905 murders will be
surpassed this year.
   The three under arrest were identified as Anthony Rupert, 18,
and two cousins, Thane Bobie West, 18, and Mike Solomon, 22.

   The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to
toughen criminal penalties for rip-offs by savings and loan
officials and to create a special prosecutor and a national
commission on the scandal.
   The legislation was brought hastily to the full House so
lawmakers could vote tough on S&amp;L crime before they recess for the
summer at week's end. It passed 424-4.
   The American taxpayers have been ``terrorized by thugs whose
weapons were pens, not guns,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
``If this measure is enacted, there will be no more excuses for
government inaction,'' he said.
   The agency overseeing the bailout of the thrift industry has
said it will need up to $100 billion in fiscal 1991 alone to deal
with the tidal wave of insolvencies.
   The bill would increase the maximum prison terms _ up to life in
prison for the worst offenders _ and boost fines that could be
levied against individuals and institutions convicted of savings
and loan crimes.
   It also would create new felony categories to close loopholes
for those who conceal assets from the government or who try to
obstruct government inquiries into financial institutions, and give
the government new authority to go after the assets of failed S&amp;Ls.
   The bill would authorize adding $153 million to the federal
government's law enforcement efforts, and create a ``special
counsel'' within the Justice Department to oversee a new Financial
Institutions Fraud Unit.
   It also would create a national commission, opposed by President
Bush, to examine the causes of the thrift crisis and propose steps
to prevent its repetition.
   Banking committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, one of the
few to vote against the measure, said proponents hoped the measure
would ``fool the American people'' that the crisis was being solved.
   ``What we have here is a bastard child with all the defects,''
he argued. Gonzalez' panel, expert on the issue, was bypassed by
the House leadership in its push for swift election-year action.
   ``I'd say `Baloney,' but I don't even know if that word is
sufficient to describe what is happening today,'' said Rep. Paul
Kanjorski, D-Pa., who joined Gonzalez in his lonely criticism of
the bill.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, acknowledged that the bill might be ``a
bit overzealous,'' but Congress had to act. The S&amp;L operators had
proven, he said, that ``You don't have to break into Fort Knox to
steal the government's gold.''
   Only Reps. Craig Washington, D-Texas, and Philip Crane, R-Ill.,
joined Gonzalez and Kanjorski in voting against the bill.
   The Senate passed its version of a savings and loan crackdown as
part of an overall crime bill. The two chambers must reconcile
their differences before a bill can be sent to the president.

<HEAD>Joan Lunden Denies Plans for Divorce or Having Alien Baby</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If inquiring minds really want to know, Joan
Lunden is not leaving ``Good Morning America,'' or getting a
divorce, or having an alien's baby.
   She confided all this Tuesday after telling viewers of ABC's
morning show that National Enquirer reporters have been asking her
colleagues if she seems troubled lately.
   ``It was a pre-emptive strike,'' she said afterwards. ``I told
them (her colleagues), I could either do that or just be a wimp and
sit back and let them make up whatever they want and print it.''
   ``As far as I know, this was just something we were checking out
and we've no plans to run a story,'' said Ian Calder, editor of the
tabloid paper in Lantana, Fla.
   During Tuesday's show, Lunden, speaking with co-host Charles
Gibson, said two free-lance reporters working for the Enquirer, had
been calling her colleagues, and in one case one of them posed as
an ABC publicist.
   She said the tabloid newshawks said things about her, like ``we
hear she's been acting strange lately, crying on the set,
depressed'' _ she mock-whimpered _ ``and we want to know what's
going on in her life.''
   She and her friends have been taking bets on what the Enquirer's
story will be, she said, jokingly posing a multiple-choice question:
   ``Am I going to leave the show, leave my husband, or maybe have
an alien baby? And it turns out they apparently voted for my
husband and I to get a divorce.''
   After the show, she said she isn't leaving her top-rated show,
and she and her husband, Michael Krauss, are not getting a divorce.
   ``And I'm not having an alien baby.''
   The Enquirer this week has a story with the headline ``Friendly
Aliens Altered My Body and Changed My Life.''
   Calder said the queries about Lunden concerned problems her
husband, a TV producer, has had due to lawsuits stemming from
production bills for ``Everyday,'' a syndicated program on which
Lunden is hostess, he said.
   ``We had a tip that that caused some trouble between them,''
said Calder, who denied that the free-lancers checking out the tip
posed as other than themselves.
   ``I think what we were checking out was, in the wake of the
financial problems that her husband had had, if this would affect
the marriage,'' he said. As far as he knows, he said, ``it never
came to anything.''
   There was no query about whether Lunden and her husband, who
have three children, were divorcing, said Calder.
   ``No, I think that's going too far. As far as I know, we never
got a tip they were thinking about getting a divorce.''

<HEAD>Weather, Shorter Days Help Firefighters in Alaska</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scattered rain, lower temperatures and
shorter days helped firefighters battle more than 100 blazes that
have burned more than 2 million acres of Alaskan wildlands, a
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Smaller fires burned in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California.
   Several days of cloudy skies and temperatures in the 50s and 60s
across much of Alaska's interior have reduced the intensity of many
fires, said Sue Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the Interagency Fire
Information Center.
   ``And we're having darkness at night now, which really helps
cool things down,'' she said.
   Earlier this summer, the sun was almost continually above the
horizon and temperatures in some places were in the 90s, drying out
forests and tundra.
   Alaska's wildfire season began on July 1, as lightning strikes
ignited dozens of blazes in remote regions.
   On Tuesday, more than 100 fires burned across the state.
   More than 827 firefighters battled the Tok River fire near the
town of Tok 175 miles southeast of Fairbanks. The blaze has charred
about 91,200 acres.
   Crews have nearly surrounded the 142-square-mile fire with a
fire line, Mitchell said. Using bulldozers and hand tools, crews
have removed vegetation along more than 60 miles of fire line,
hoping to rob the advancing fire of fuel.
   The state's largest fire burned across 275,000 acres along
either side of the Coleen River on the southern flank of the Brooks
Range, inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

   The House Armed Services Committee dealt a
serious blow Tuesday to President Bush's hopes of building a fleet
of 75 stealth bombers, halting the program at the 15 B-2s now under
construction, lawmakers said.
   The committee, meeting in private, rejected an attempt to save
the 75-plane fleet. At nearly $865 million each, the radar-evading
bomber is the costliest plane ever built.
   The death knells for the bomber began last week when the
committee's chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said he supported
halting production at 15 planes.
   Monday night, the panel's procurement subcommittee eliminated
funds for a 75-bomber fleet. The full committee voted 34-20 Tuesday
to reject an amendment by Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., to reverse the
subcommittee's action, Aspin told reporters.
   Separately, the research and development subcommittee chopped
nearly $2 billion from Bush's 1991 budget request for the Strategic
Defense Initiative and eliminated research money for two nuclear
missiles.
   Also meeting in private, the subcommittee approved spending $2.9
billion on SDI, commonly known as Star Wars.
   Later in the day, the full committee was expected to vote on the
overall bill, which would allocate $283 billion for defense in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Bush, who in January proposed spending $307 billion on defense
in fiscal 1991, had called for $4.7 billion for SDI, a $900 million
increase over the amount Congress appropriated in fiscal 1990.
   Congressional support for the anti-missile shield, however, has
weakened significantly as the Soviet threat fades overseas and
economic problems rise at home.
   Earlier this month, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved
a fiscal 1991 defense bill that cut almost $1 billion from Bush's
SDI request.
   To meet the House-approved budget target of $283 billion for
overall military spending, the House committee has been forced to
slash $24 billion from Bush's request of early this year.
   Since Thursday, the six subcommittees have been making
substantial reductions to meet the target, and on Tuesday the
research panel focused on a handful of strategic programs.
   Bush had called for spending $548 million on the
multiple-warhead MX missiles and on moving the missiles from silos
to rail cars. The fiscal 1991 budget also included $202 million for
the single-warhead Midgetman.
   The research subcommittee eliminated all research funds for the
two missiles and, instead, created a $600 million advanced
strategic missile pot for developing the next generation of
missiles.
   The panel also called on Bush to report to the committee in 90
days on which new missile the administration wants _ MX or
Midgetman _ and end the debate that has festered for years.
   The research subcommittee's actions came less than 24 hours
after the Armed Services' subcommittee on procurement and military
nuclear systems eliminated 1.3 billion for financing the MX
rail-garrison program.
   As for the B-2, Bush had proposed a fleet of 132 bombers last
January. In April, the administration scaled its proposal back to
75.
   While making substantial cuts in strategic programs, the panel
rejected an effort by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to kill the
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off
like a helicopter but can fly like a plane.
   The subcommittee approved $238 million for the Osprey. On
Monday, the procurement subcommittee added somewhat less, $165
million, for the V-22.

<HEAD>Government Checks North Decision For Possible Impact on Other
Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is reviewing the
appeals court decision that upset Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra
convictions because of concern about its possible impact on future
cases, officials said Tuesday.
   In a 2-1 decision, a panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here ordered a ``witness-by-witness'' review of the evidence to
determine if North's trial was influenced by congressional
testimony he gave under a limited grant of immunity from
prosecution.
   The ``use immunity'' grant meant that the detailed descriptions
of the Iran-Contra affair that North gave Congress couldn't be used
against him as evidence in a criminal trial.
   Independent Councsel Lawrence E. Walsh's office is considering
whether to seek a rehearing of the case by the full 12-member
appellate court or to ask the Supreme Court to review the issue.
Walsh has at least a month to decide.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said officials were
concerned about the decision's impact on a limited number of cases
where the government might want to prosecute someone whose
congressional testimony received widespread publicity.
   Other department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the new procedures could have wider implications, particularly
in cases where defendants receive limited immunity from courts or
grand juries.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, was convicted
last year of three felonies, including aiding and abetting the
obstruction of Congress and destruction of government documents.
Gesell placed North on probation and ordered him to perform 1500
hours of community service.
   The appellate court held that U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell should have conducted extensive hearings to determine if
grand jurors, witnesses and prosecutors were influenced by North's
congressional testimony, which was aired on network television.
   Gesell had held that the elaborate procedures that Walsh imposed
to shield grand jurors and his staff from the publicity prevented
the case from being influenced by North's testimony.
   Walsh also placed under court seal evidence his investigation
found before North appeared on Capitol Hill to prove that the case
was derived independently from the congressional testimony.
   As it stands, the decision applies only to federal courts in the
nation's capital. But those courts try many of the so-called
political cases, in which criminal defendants already have been
subjects of congressional inquiries.
   Eramian said the department was conducting its own review of the
July 20 decision.
   He stressed that the Justice Department was not necessarily
contemplating participation in any appeal. Under the independent
counsel law, the Justice Department could file a
friend-of-the-court brief to state its legal views on the case.
   The appeals court panel's majority set what federal prosecutors
called a very high, perhaps impossible, standard for proving that
evidence was not derived from testimony that a defendant gave under
a limited immunity grant.
   Some legal experts say the North decision radically extends a
1972 Supreme Court decision that bars prosecutors from introducing
evidence that was derived in any way from testimony obtained as a
result of limited immunity.
   ``What they did in this case was to virtually change use
immunity into transactional immunity,'' under which the government
agrees not to prosecute someone in return for their cooperation,
said G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame law professor who drafted the
1970 use immunity statute.
   The court, in effect, created a rule that ``once anything was
disseminated as widely as North's testimony, it necessarily
affected the trial,'' Blakey said.
   Gerald Caplan, a George Washington University law professor,
called the North decision ``sort of an ingenious way of overruling
a Supreme Court decision from a group that would otherwise be
thought to have a prosecution bias.''
   President Reagan appointed the two circuit judges who joined in
the ruling, Laurence H. Silberman and David Sentelle. President
Carter appointed Patricia Wald, the appellate court's chief judge
who dissented from the decision.
   ``The two majority judges simply let North off,'' Blakey said.
``This opinion harkens back to a kind of solicitude for the
defendant that was characteristic of Warren Court opinions and
hardly charactistic of Reagan court opinions.''

   Campaign reforms approved by the Senate
envision new multimillion-dollar public contributions to Senate
candidates at the same time taxpayers are cutting back donations to
presidential campaigns.
   The Senate, still debating the measure, has approved provisions
that include public financing of up to $20 million for broadcast
time. The money would be available to candidates who agree to stay
within a spending limit.
   Also approved Monday were other incentives to abide by the
ceiling _ including postal discounts, help in responding to
interest-group attacks and money to offset funds raised by an
opponent who exceeds the spending limit.
   The public money for the Senate races would come from the
existing and already strained fund for presidential campaigns.
   Taxpayers can choose to contribute to the fund by earmarking $1
from their tax returns.
   But contributions to the presidential campaign are dwindling.
   ``The presidential fund is in trouble,'' said Fred Eiland, a
spokesman for the Federal Election Commission. ``We have been
saying since two years ago that there is a problem, and that it's
going to be more serious and that Congress needs to do something.''
   Taxpayer participation in the presidential campaign fund reached
an all-time high of 28.7 percent in 1980 and fell to a record low
of 20.1 percent in 1988, the FEC said.
   Donations to the fund dwindled from $33.6 million in 1987 to
$32.2 million in 1989, Eiland said.
   Tax returns through May 1990 brought in about $25 million, and
the Internal Revenue Service says relatively few returns are still
expected from taxpayers given extensions.
   The strain on the fund has been compounded by inflation. As
participation has dropped, payouts to candidates have been rising
each year to adjust for inflation.
   The FEC has advised the president, Congress and the treasury
secretary that it expects a $202,000 shortfall in 1992, when the
presidential campaign is projected to cost about $184 million.
   If no incumbent is seeking re-election in 1996, that could mean
more candidates for both major parties. The FEC projects a $238
million shortfall that year for an election expected to cost about
$270 million.
   The FEC paid out $178 million for the 1988 election. As of May
1990, there was a balance of $108 million in the presidential
campaign fund.

   The AFL-CIO voted Tuesday to remain neutral on
abortion but said it resented government intrusion into personal
matters.
   ``The overwhelming view of the council was that this was a
matter of deep conscience, conviction and religion,'' Lane
Kirkland, president of the labor umbrella group, told reporters.
   The vote by the AFL-CIO's 35-member executive council rejected a
call from some members who wanted to back abortion rights in hopes
it would help recruit women and minorities into the struggling
labor movement.
   ``We resent and resist government intrusion into matters that
are essentially private...,'' the executive council said in a
policy statement issued at the group's annual mid-summer meeting.
   ``The AFL-CIO, therefore, adopts a carefully considered policy
of deferring to the individual judgments of its affiliates and
their members on'' abortion, said the statement, issued by the
governing board.
   Three members of the council dissented during the voice vote.
   In voting to remain neutral, the council adopted the
recommendation of an 18-member panel of AFL-CIO union presidents.
   Kirkland declined to speculate at a news conference about
whether a pro-choice vote would have helped expand the 14.2
million-member organization.
   The group has never in its 35-year history voted on abortion
rights, he said.
   There was no organized move afoot for the federation to condemn
abortion.
   However, the National Right to Life Committee and Cardinal John
J. O'Connor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York had
campaigned against the AFL-CIO taking a stand.
   They noted that a recent Supreme Court decision gives union
members the right to withhold dues spent on political issues.
   Many union leaders interpreted that campaign as a threat by the
committee and O'Connor that they would lobby members to withhold
union dues if the AFL-CIO went pro-choice.
   ``We received a very large volume of mail on both sides of the
issue...,'' Kirkland said. ``We don't regard that as pressure. You
only have pressure if you feel pressure.''
   On other issues, the AFL-CIO's governing body voted to:
   _Support President Bush's call for new taxes to raise revenue
and curb the budget deficit. But new revenues ``should be sought
through higher bracket rates for the wealthy and corporations, as
well as higher taxes on inherited wealth,'' the union said.
   _Oppose proposals such as a national value-added tax or raising
excise taxes on cigarettes, beer and Social Security benefits. The
union also said it opposes efforts to eliminate or reduce the
federal deduction for state and local taxes.
   _Support an individual federal campaign contribution limit of
$100 per candidate and $1,000 per year coupled with a ban on all
political action committees.

<HEAD>Senators Introduce Bills To Improve Medical Research on Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Democratic senators, introducing a
package of bills Tuesday to improve medical research on women, said
women have been ill-served in a medical system that is dominated by
men.
   Rep. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., leader of the effort, said women
have been ignored in a ``disgraceful pattern of neglect.''
   She pointed to the National Institutes of Health, where she said
13 percent of funds are spent on women's health research and few
women are included in clinical trials testing experimental drugs
and procedures.
   Even though heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, nearly
all the heart disease research is done on men, she said. Also, the
breast cancer death rate is rising but ``no one knows why,'' she
said.
   ``Clearly there has been an imbalance,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill.
   ``This gender bias must be corrected,'' said Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash. ``What we're really talking about is women's lives.''
   Two proposals _ to create an NIH office for Women's Health
Research and Development and require that more women be included in
clinical trials _ were to be offered as amendments to a bill
reauthorizing NIH. The bill was to be taken up by the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee on Wednesday.
   Other bills in the package would broaden research on
contraception, infertility, AIDS in women, breast cancer and
osteoporosis; improve and broaden health education programs for
women; and offer more screening for early detection of cancer.
   Similar legislation is pending in the House.
   The package would cost about $240 million, which Mikulski said
was ``a very modest amount.'' But she said she did not expect all
of the bills to pass this year.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices at Farm Unchanged in July, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products were
unchanged from June to July, but the overall commodity index was
still 2.7 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   Prices were higher during the month for lettuce, apples and
milk, but declines were reported for cattle, wheat and eggs, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary
report.
   Most prices are mid-July averages which will be revised next
month. For example, the latest report showed June prices dropped 2
percent instead of the 1.3 percent decline indicated a month ago.
   The report also showed prices farmers pay to meet expenses were
up 0.5 percent from April, when the previous estimate was made, and
3.4 percent above July 1989. The ``prices paid'' index is computed
quarterly.
   Meanwhile, department economists say consumer food prices are
going up much faster this year than the earlier prediction of 3
percent to 5 percent.
   Ralph L. Parlett Jr. of the department's Economic Research
Service said in a telephone interview that a new 1990 forecast due
out in August will ``put us right back to the early 1980s'' when
retail food prices were climbing steeply.
   According to USDA records, annual food price increases were 8.6
percent in 1980 and 7.9 percent in 1981 before slowing their upward
rise in the next few years.
   Parlett did not disclose the new forecast but indicated the 1990
increase would probably exceed 6 percent. Food prices rose 5.8
percent in 1989, the most since 1981.
   ``It's obvious that 3-to-5 percent forecast is out in left
field,'' he said. ``Beef and pork, that's what's doing it; pork,
particularly.''
   Recent forecasts show the net cash income of farmers in the
range of $55 billion to $59 billion, compared with about $54
billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $47 billion to $51
billion, compared with $49 billion last year.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the July price index for
livestock and poultry dropped 1.2 percent from June but still
averaged 8.9 percent more than a year ago. Meat animals were down
1.5 percent from June but averaged 11 percent more than in June
1989.
   Milk prices rose 30 cents in July to an average of $14.10 per
l00 pounds. That was up $1.50 from July 1989. The farm price of
milk rose to a record $16 per hundredweight in December before
easing down.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 1.6 percent from June but averaged
4.4 percent below the year-earlier level.
   Vegetable prices rose 20 percent from June but were down 14
percent from a year earlier. Lettuce, tomatoes and sweet corn led
the July increase.
   Fruit prices were up 7.9 percent from June and 13 percent above
a year ago. Apples, grapefruit and peaches rose in July, while
oranges, pears and lemons were down.
   Wheat prices, pressured by a bumper harvest, dropped 27 cents
during the month to $2.81 per bushel.
   Feed grains declined, with corn prices down two cents from June
to $2.61 per bushel.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $97 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
down from $98.10 in June but up from $94.60 in July 1989. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $60.10 per 100 pounds, unchanged from June but up
from $45.90 in July 1989.
   _Corn, at $2.61 a bushel, was down from $2.63 in June but up
from $2.47 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.81 per bushel, compared with $3.08 in June and $3.78 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.08 in June
and $7.45 in July 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.88 per bushel, unchanged from June but down
from $6.83 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 63.7 cents per pound, compared
with 62.3 in June and 59.5 a year earlier.
   _Eggs were 55.6 cents per dozen, compared with 62.7 in June and
64.9 in July 1989.
   _Milk was $14.10 per 100 pounds, up from $13.80 in June and the
average of $12.60 a year ago.
   _Broilers were 36.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
34.1 cents in June and 38.7 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>Risk of Blast at Nuclear Waste Site Worries Officials</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: INSERTS after 6th graf pvs, Leo Duffy, to clarify status of
other sites, picks up 7th graf pvs, Westinghouse Hanford.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Too little is known about the risk of an
explosion that could rupture nuclear waste tanks at the Hanford
weapons plant in Washington state, a government advisory panel said
Tuesday.
   The possibility of a blast may be greater than plant operators
acknowledge because there is ``only sketchy information on
conditions in the tanks,'' said the Energy Department's Advisory
Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety.
   ``The Hanford tanks present a serious situation, if not an
imminent hazard,'' the committee said.
   The 177 underground tanks at Hanford in south-central Washington
state hold thousands of gallons of highly radioactive sludge from
decades of plutonium production at the weapons plant.
   Officials last March said they were concerned because an
explosion could be triggered by an accumulation of hydrogen or
other unknown chemical reactions in some of the 20 double-walled
tanks at the facility.
   Leo Duffy, who heads government cleanup efforts at atomic
weapons facilities, said Tuesday the chance of an explosion is low
but is still a serious problem.
   Highly radioactive wastes also are stored in tanks at the
Savannah River weapons plant near Aiken, S.C., and at a plant near
West Valley, N.Y. But those tanks contain different chemicals and
do not pose the same risks as the tanks at Hanford, Energy
Department officials have said.
   Westinghouse Hanford Co., which runs the 560-square-mile
facility in south-central Washington, has played down the
possibility of an explosion.
   But the Energy Department panel suggested in a letter to Energy
Secretary James Watkins that the Hanford operators may have
incomplete or incorrect information.
   ``The technical basis for the analysis from which the (Hanford)
operator draws comfort about the safety of the tanks is weak,
considering the potential consequences,'' the panel said. ``Each
successive review of the Hanford tanks indicates that the situation
is a little worse.''
   The panel made the assessment in a July 23 letter to Watkins
made public by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday.
   John Ahearne, chairman of the advisory panel, declined to
characterize the risk of an explosion because of the lack of
information.
   He said no one knows what chemical combinations are in the tanks
and unreliable temperature sensors may be misleading.
   ``There is an urgent need to determine what is in the tanks,
what are the risks and what actions should be taken to ameliorate
the hazards,'' the advisory panel report said.
   An accident involving similarly stored wastes in the Soviet
Union in 1957 released huge amounts of radiation and contaminated
an area covering hundreds of square miles, forcing the evacuation
of 10,000 people. To this day, children are not allowed near the
areas that were heavily contaminated, and agricultural crops from
the region are not allowed to be sold elsewhere, officials said.
   But Duffy said the Soviet site is not the same as the Hanford
plant.
   ``We have a huge gap here. We're trying to find out what's in
the existing tanks,'' Duffy said.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., calling for more investigation, said
the Energy Department and plant operators remind him of ``three
witches with a bubbling caldron, saying ``bubble, bubble, toil and
trouble. They're stirring it and don't seem to know what's in
there.''

<HEAD>Freighter to Evacuate 100 Foreign Nationals From Jaffna</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freighter left Colombo for
rebel-held Jaffna on Tuesday to evacuate about 100 foreign
nationals caught in the cross fire between Tamil guerrillas and the
army.
   Officials meanwhile reported that at least 54 people were killed
in two days of fighting across this island nation off the southeast
tip of India.
   Military officials said the freighter Lanka Siri sailed for
Point Pedro at the northernmost tip of the Jaffna Peninsula, which
has been severed from the mainland by the 50-day fighting. The ship
was expected to return Wednesday.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 90 of
those awaiting evacuation carried British passports. Most were
Tamil expatriates who were visiting their homeland when fighting
broke out on June 11, ending a 13-month cease-fire in the
7-year-old civil war.
   One person carried a Swiss passport, officials said, and they
did not know the others' nationalities.
   Communications with Jaffna have been cut off.
   The evacuation was being supervised by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, said the officials.
   Military officials said at least seven rebels and five soldiers
were killed in fighting Tuesday in northwestern Mannar.
   On Monday night, unidentified gunmen killed 20 Tamil civilians
in northeastern Kantalai village, military officials and residents
said.
   Tamil residents of nearby Trincomalee town blamed the and said
the killings were in retribution for a Tamil rebel ambush on troops
two days earlier.
   Military officials said the assailants were Moslems who attacked
to avenge Tamil raids on their community.
   The officials said earlier Tuesday that rebels shot 14 Moslems
to death in the Ampara district, south of Trincomalee.
   Moslems, who comprise about 7 percent of the 16 million
population, are often caught in the middle of the civil war between
the minority Tamils and Sinhalese-dominated government. The rebels
accuse them of siding with the army.
   In Jaffna, at least six rebels and two police were killed,
military officials said. They said guards at Palali airfield killed
the rebels and that the police were killed when air force planes
accidentally dropped bombs close to Jaffna Fort.
   The deaths raise to more than 3,000 the number of combatants
killed in the fighting, the latest phase of the war for an
independent Tamil homeland. Many civilians also have died.
   Tamils makie up 18 percent of the million population. They
complain they are discriminated against in jobs and education by
the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of Sri Lankans and who
control the army and the government.
   More than 14,000 people have died in the Tamil revolt since it
began in 1983.

   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the most popular program
on television last week.
   The show aired the day before its star, Roseanne Barr, was
roundly criticized for her screeching rendition of the national
anthem at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium.
   ``Roseanne'' led with a 14.6 rating, according to figures
released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. A rating point represents
921,000 households.
   It also was No. 1 in every target demographic group, said David
Marans, a vice president for media research at the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency. In overall ratings, ABC pulled even
with NBC, the perennial winner. Both averaged an 8.9 rating for the
week. CBS was third at 8.4, but each averaged only a 17 share _ or
17 percent of the televisions in use in prime time.
   That meant hardly anyone was watching, Marans said.
   ``The three networks' share was a 51 for the week. That's among
the lowest, if not the lowest ever recorded,'' he said. ``They
received about half the available viewers. That has to be a cause
for heartache for them.''
   Another situation comedy rerun, NBC's ``Cheers,'' was No. 2, and
CBS' rerun of its 1987 miniseries ``Murder Ordained'' on Sunday
night tied for third place with NBC's ``The Cosby Show.''
   The ``shocking four-hour miniseries'' starred Keith Carradine,
JoBeth Williams and Terry Kinney in the true-life tale of a
minister's adultery and two murders that rocked Emporia, Kan.
   NBC won the ratings on three nights: Wednesday, Thursday and
Saturday, but its Sunday ratings suffered at the hands of the Fox
Broadcasting Co. hits ``The Simpsons,'' ``Married ... with
Children'' and ``In Living Color.''
   ``They had a terrible Sunday,'' Marans said. ``An 11 share was
one of the lowest nights NBC has ever recorded.''
   Fox found its own woes by experimenting with two new shows and a
special on Wednesday, said Tim Dempsey, another media analyst at J.
Walter Thompson.
   ``They're not exempt from viewer defection and viewer
desertion,'' Dempsey said. Fox's ``Molloy,'' ``Glory Days'' and the
special ``Hollywood Dog'' were the lowest-rated programs on
television, each drawing a 5 share.
   Curiously enough, reruns are outperforming the original programs
the networks have offered this summer in hopes of keeping viewers
glued to the tube, Dempsey said.
   ``There's always been a general feeling during the summer season
that all these shows are failed pilots,'' he said. ``They're being
perceived as filler, and that they weren't strong enough to make it
onto the lineup permanently.''
   Here are the top 10 reruns, with their networks and ratings:
   ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 14.6; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 14.4; ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC, 13.3; ``CBS Sunday Movie'' (``Murder Ordained''), CBS,
13.3; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 13.1; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC, 12.9; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 12.9; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 12.3; ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, 12.3; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC,
12.2.
   In the battle for network evening news ratings, ABC won again
with an 8.9 rating. CBS was second with a 7.8 rating, fractionally
ahead of NBC's 7.6.

<HEAD>NEA Lifts News Blackout on Grant-Review Sessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under the pressure of a lawsuit filed by four
major newspapers, the National Endowment for the Arts reversed
itself Tuesday and announced that a meeting of its advisory council
to review controversial grant decisions will be open to the public.
   Chairman John E. Frohnmayer abandoned plans for a news blackout
of the council sessions later this week after the Los Angeles
Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Philadelphia
Inquirer sued the NEA in U.S. District Court on Monday.
   ``It is highly unusual for any agency of the federal government
to conduct application review in the glare of public scrutiny,''
Frohnmayer said in a statement. ``But I am convinced that there are
significant advantages to having our citizens aware of how this
small amount of their money is invested in cultural activities all
Americans enjoy as a result of the endowment.''
   The NEA is an independent federal agency with a budget of $171
million, most of which supports a wide variety of artists and arts
institutions with federal grants that must be matched by private
funds.
   The 26-member National Council on the Arts, the endowment's
presidentially appointed advisory body, plans to begin a three-day
meeting here Friday. In the past, its meetings have been open to
the public except for sessions devoted to reviewing grant
applications recommended by the NEA's panels of outside arts
experts on theater, dance, music and other disciplines.
   As late as Monday, Frohnmayer had insisted that the council's
grant-review sessions would be closed. But on Tuesday, he said he
decided to lift the news blackout partly because a majority of
council members had voted at their last meeting in May to open the
sessions.
   In their lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order against
the NEA, the four newspapers said a news blackout would prevent the
public from observing the council as it reconsiders Frohnmayer's
veto of panel-approved grants to four controversial, avant-garde
theater performers in late June.
   After Frohnmayer's announcement, the newspapers' lawyers
withdrew the lawsuit.
   One of the lawyers, Patrick J. Carome, had said earlier that the
NEA was ``acting as if they're giving away private money when in
fact it's taxpayer dollars.'' Arts supporters said the public is
entitled to know how its tax money is being spent.
   At the council meetings this weekend, Frohnmayer also was
expected to ask the council to reconsider its recommendation that
he reject two grants to the Institute of Contemporary Art in
Philadelphia. He said the council's discussion of the grants in May
was inadequate and its information was incomplete.
   It was the same Philadelphia institute that started the current
NEA controversy when it used endowment funds to organize a
traveling exhibition of sexually explicit works by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.
   Last fall, at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other
NEA critics, Congress voted to prohibit federal support for any
artistic works that ``may be considered obscene'' and include
depiction of sex acts, sadomasochism, homoeroticism or sexual
exploitation of children.
   Frohnmayer told an independent commission created by Congress to
study the NEA's grant-making procedures that he still opposes
legislation to restrict the content of federally supported art.
   But the endowment's chairman said he believes that an arts
project that is ``so offensive that it simply leads to
confrontation and solidification of positions'' should not receive
government support.
   Frohnmayer has issued guidelines to NEA grant applicants to
refrain from using federal funds to create works that might violate
the Supreme Court's 1973 obscenity standards. He told the
commission Monday that he could accept a law imposing penalties on
NEA grant recipients who are convicted on obscenity charges.

<TEXT>
   Bangladesh on Tuesday ordered 8,000
striking government doctors to return to work or be fired. The
doctors, in turn, threatened to resign en masse on Aug. 15.
   News reports said at least 50 people died due to lack of medical
care over the last three days in Dhaka, the capital; Rangapur; and
Khulna.
   A spokesman for Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the country's
largest, said about 1,100 of the hospital's 1,500 patients went
home Tuesday because they were not being treated and that hundreds
more left other hospitals. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Health Minister Azizur Rahman called the 4-day-old strike
illegal. He said the government would not reconsider its new health
policy, which seeks to ban private practice by government doctors.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's announcement of the policy
Wednesday led to doctors' protests and then to a strike Saturday at
the 600 state hospitals.
   General Secretary Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin of the Bangladesh
Medical Association said the strike will continue because the
government refused to meet doctors' demands. He said the doctors
plan to resign in a group on Aug. 15. About 500 doctors have
already given their resignation letters to the medical association,
he said.
   Mohiuddin said all letters will be handed over to the Health
Ministry if the government does not call off the new health policy.
   Parliament, dominated by Ershad's Jatiya (National) Party,
endorsed the policy late Monday but delayed indefinitely making it
law.
   The strikers demand that the government spend more money for the
health sector instead of barring them from private practice.
   An impoverished nation of 110 million people, Bangladesh spends
about one dollar per person annually for medicare. The annual per
capita income is $170.
   The dispute has turned political. The two main opposition
groups, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Bangladesh Awami
League, asked the government in separate statements to withdraw the
health policy.
   About 1,000 Jatiya Party activists marched through Dhaka on
Monday, chanting ``Death to the striking doctors!''

<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of a former Mexican
president was found guilty Tuesday of racketeering, kidnapping and
conspiracy in the death of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   Ruben Zuno Arce, a successful Guadalajara businessman, was the
third defendant to be found guilty in a trial which sought to place
blame on many in the 1985 kidnap-murder of Camarena and his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar. He wasn't charged with murder.
   The case has strained relations between Mexico and the United
States because of U.S. officials allegations of complicity between
Mexican officials and drug dealers.
   Prosecutors said the slayings were revenge for Drug Enforcement
Administration raids on marijuana and cocaine plantations that cost
the drug barons $5 billion in profits.
   Zuno is the brother-in-law of Luis Echeverria, the former
president of Mexico. His lawyers maintained he had nothing to do
with the Camarena affair and merely had the bad luck to sell his
Guadalajara home to a drug kingpin who used the place as a torture
chamber.
   The key evidence against Zuno came from two government
informants who were former Mexican policemen. One of them told of
seeing Zuno at a meeting in which drug barons discussed the need to
kidnap a drug enforcement agent.
   The other witness told of alleged drug trade activities by Zuno.
His lawyers claimed he was an upstanding businessman without ties
to the underworld.
   The same jurors previously convicted two other defendants of
racketeering and kidnapping.
   Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican policeman, was found
guilty of kidnapping but innocent of murder on Monday. Last week,
reputed drug baron Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros was convicted of
the Camarena kidnapping, but the jury also declined to convict him
of murder.
   One verdict remains pending against Javier Vasquez Velasco, who
is accused of murdering two American tourists in an apparent
mistake killing.
   Jurors resumed their deliberations Tuesday afternoon following
announcement of the verdicts and lawyers were told by U.S. District
Judge Edward Rafeedie to refrain from commenting until all the
verdicts were in.
   Rafeedie scheduled sentencing for Zuno on Sept. 18. Zuno faces a
maximum sentence of life in prison.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street
in February 1985. Testimony showed the agent was tortured and
interrogated by drug lords before being slain along with Avelar.
   Their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles from
Guadalajara.
   The trial was the second stemming from the Camarena murder,
which strained U.S.-Mexican relations and embarrassed Mexico with
testimony about dealings between corrupt law enforcement officers
and drug dealers.
   In a 1988 Los Angeles federal trial, two defendants were
convicted of multiple charges, including murder, in the Camarena
case and a third defendant was convicted of aiding the escape of
Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero.
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this country. Over
20 have been imprisoned in Mexico.

   The Pentagon's inspector general is
investigating the production schedule and cost projections for the
Navy's A-12 attack plane, the Defense Department spokesman said on
Tuesday.
   The probe is the second being conducted in connection with the
planned aircraft.
   The A-12, which is under development, is supposed to be the
Navy's top priority replacement for its aging fleet of A-6 Intruder
attack jets.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney wanted more information about reports he'd
received on the program.
   ``The secretary said ... `I've got some questions, I want them
answered,''' Williams said. The inspector general's office ``is
conducting what I would characterize as a limited investigation of
the A-12 schedule and cost projections.''
   The aircraft has been the focus of some controversy since the
Navy announced earlier this year that it was a year behind schedule
_ a delay widely interpreted as foreshadowing extra costs.
   The announcement amounted to an embarrassment for Cheney because
he had ordered a months-long review of the military's costliest
aircraft programs, but the study had failed to turn up any such
problems.
   Meanwhile, both the House and Senate Armed Service Committees
have moved to pare funding for the program.
   And Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III ordered his own
personnel to look into the problems.
   The Navy study is ``somewhat broader'' than the Pentagon's,
Williams said.
   ``They're looking at program management techniques, they're
looking at cost schedules, when this information became available,
that sort of thing,'' the spokesman said. He said officials were
``closely coordinating their work'' for both studies.
   Officials at McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.,
the plane's contractors, have reported that the first flight of the
plane would be delayed until late 1991.
   The problems reportedly involve the plane's composite materials,
which save weight and lower radar reflections but are very
difficult to fabricate into aircraft parts.
   Following his review of aircraft programs, Cheney announced in
April that he was sharply cutting the proposed A-12 purchase.
Although the Navy had originally planned to buy 858 of the
long-range, carrier-based aircraft, the secretary said he
envisioned buying 620.
   No cost for the super-secret program has been made public, but
it has been reported that the plane was being developed under a
$4.8 billion fixed price contract and extended production could run
upwards of $55 billion.
   ``One of the problems you're faced with from time to time in
this business, is ... the problems of cost overruns and slips in
schedule. But, obviously, I was not happy with the way the A-12
thing was handled,'' Cheney said in June.

   The British submarine HMS Conqueror, which sank
the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands war,
will be scrapped as part of cuts in military spending, the Ministry
of Defense said Tuesday.
   The 19-year-old nuclear-powered submarine is one of nine vessels
to be broken up or sold. The others are the frigate HMS Phoebe, two
diesel-powered submarines, minehunters, patrol craft and the diving
ship HMS Challenger, the ministry said.
   The defense ministry said cuts also will affect the army, the
Royal Air Force, and research and recruitment for all the armed
services.
   Details of the reductions released Tuesday amplify an
announcement on July 25 by Defense Secretary Tom King that there
would be cuts totalling $1.1 billion.
   The ministry said Conqueror would be scrapped because it was
ready for a refitting that would cost more than $37 million.
   The Argentine navy lost 368 of the more than 1,000 men on board
its only cruiser when Conqueror fired two conventional torpedoes at
the warship on May 2, 1982. The loss of life was the worst single
disaster to either side in the 74-day war.
   The sinking kept the Argentine navy in port for the rest of the
conflict, which ended with a British task force regaining the
islands from Argentine occupation.

   West Germany bought the freedom of 33,000
East German political prisoners from 1964 until last year's fall of
the Communist government, East Germany's interior minister said
Tuesday.
   Peter-Michael Diestel told reporters that West Germany paid
$60,000 for each prisoner in later years.
   When the practice began in 1964, East Germany's Communist
authorities requested $25,000 for the release of each prisoner,
Diestel said. The price rose over the years.
   Diestel said the Communist government sometimes demanded payment
in goods rather than money. This happened first at Christmas 1964,
when ``oranges were traded for the children of the country,'' he
said.
   The Communist government began selling political prisoners to
raise badly-needed hard currency.
   Those released under the deals were allowed to take their
families with them to the West. Starting in the 1970s, those
released also included people jailed for trying to flee to the
West, Diestel said.

<TEXT>
   One of three former Northwest Airlines pilots
accused of flying while intoxicated doesn't get drunk easily
because he is an alcoholic, his lawyer said Tuesday at his trial.
   ``A person who consumes alcohol builds up a tolerance to
alcohol. Your body resists the effects of alcohol,'' attorney Peter
Wold said, referring to his client, Capt. Norman ``Lyle'' Prouse.
   Prouse is not ``a skid row drunk'' and had no trouble flying a
Boeing 727 from Fargo, N.D. to Minneapolis March 8, despite
evidence that he consumed at least 17{ rum and Diet Cokes the night
before, Wold said in his opening argument.
   Prouse, of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer Robert Kirchner, of
Highland Ranch, Colo.; and flight engineer Joseph Balzer, of
Antioch, Tenn., are charged with operating the aircraft while under
the influence of alcohol. The federal felony carries a maximum
penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Prouse had been drinking for 35 years and entered a treatment
program after his arrest, Wold said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega said in her opening
statement Tuesday that while the pilots ``may not have been
staggering drunk,'' results of blood-alcohol tests will show their
skills were seriously impaired.
   All three pilots had blood-alcohol contents exceeding .04
percent, the Federal Aviation Administration's limit for flying,
according to test results admitted Tuesday as evidence.
   Defense attorneys said Tuesday that the flight, carrying 91
passengers, went flawlessly.
   ``The issue is not what his condition was the night before or
what his alcohol content was the next day,'' Wold said. ``The
government must show their abilities were impaired.''
   ``There were no problems with altitude, no problems with
direction, no problems with speed,'' said William Mauzy, the
attorney for Kirchner. ``You can't fake a perfect landing.''
   Wold said he would introduce as evidence radar tapes and tapes
of conversations between the pilots and air traffic controllers so
the jury could judge their responses.
   The blood tests showed Prouse still had the equivalent of eight
drinks in his system after the plane departed at about 6:25 a.m.
The tests found Kirchner and Balzer had the equivalent of three
beers each still in their systems, said de la Vega.
   A bar patron tipped the FAA and Northwest that the crew drank
heavily at a bar in Moorhead, Minn., adjacent to Fargo, according
to court records.
   An FAA investigator has testified the crew smelled of alcohol
when they arrived late at the departure gate. While the
investigator phoned for instructions on how to handle the
situation, the plane departed.
   An FAA official made citizen's arrests when the plane landed at
the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Northwest fired the three for violating a rule prohibiting
drinking within 12 hours of a scheduled flight. The FAA revoked
their pilots' licenses.
   According to bills from the Speak Easy bar introduced as
evidence, Prouse ordered 15 rum and Diet Cokes while Kirchner and
Balzer shared seven pitchers of beer over about six hours.
   Kathryn Litch, a waitress at the bar, said other patrons bought
Kirchner and Balzer another pitcher of beer and that Prouse drank
at least 2{ more drinks after Kirchner and Balzer left about 10:40
p.m.
   The flight left about eight hours later.
   U.S. District Court Judge James Rosenbaum has said the trial is
expected to last about two weeks.

<HEAD>Government Pumps $200 Million More into Student Loan Guarantee
Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-sponsored Student Loan
Marketing Association said Tuesday it was pumping another $200
million into a troubled student loan guarantee agency.
   The loan to the Higher Education Assistance Fund, HEAF, buys
time for government officials who are trying to arrange a takeover
to avoid a default by the fund. The association, known as Sallie
Mae, had loaned the fund $200 million previously.
   HEAF, based in Overland Park, Kan., is the largest of 47 state
or private non-profit agencies guaranteeing student loans. A week
ago, it disclosed that it was in danger of defaulting on its claims.
   Officials from the Education Department and the Office of
Management and Budget have been trying to avoid that by arranging
for another guarantee agency or Sallie Mae to take over HEAF.
   They had said they hoped to resolve HEAF's problems this week,
but Etta Fielek, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said
the new loan will carry HEAF into the 1991 fiscal year starting
Oct. 1
   ``We're pleased with this arrangement because it provides a
stable period during which the negotiations can continue,'' she
said.
   Sallie Mae said in a statement it was making the loan ``as a
result of discussions with the Department of Education'' and that
it had received ``assurances from the department as to its
continued payment of HEAF's ... claims, which provide the
collateral.''
   The Education Department fully reimburses most of the guarantee
agencies for student loan defaults, but provides only partial
reimbursement to HEAF and others with a record of guaranteeing too
many bad loans.
   Fielek said the loan from Sallie Mae will allow HEAF to withhold
about $300 million in claims until the next fiscal year. Thus, the
guarantee agency will get 100 percent reimbursement from the
Education Department for those claims instead of 80 percent.
   Sallie Mae, which is federally chartered but shareholder owned,
finances about four of every 10 student loans by purchasing the
loans from banks and other lenders.
   ``We believe the action we are taking today will be both helpful
to assuring stability in the education credit market we serve and
in the best interest of our shareholders,'' said Lawrence A. Hough,
Sallie Mae president.

<HEAD>Parliament Sets Date for First Multiparty Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament in the central republic
of Bosnia-Hercegovina on Tuesday adopted amendments to its
constitution calling for free multiparty elections in November, the
state news agency reported.
   Under the amendments passed by the regional assembly,
Bosnia-Hercegovina ``has become a sovereign and democratic state of
equal citizens,'' Tanjug said.
   Multiparty elections are scheduled to be held Nov. 30. The new
parliament is likely to meet before the end of the year, Tanjug
said.
   The adoption of the amendments enabling the holding of free
elections has been in line with similar steps already taken or
under way in other Yugoslav republics.
   The liberal republics of Slovenia and Croatia held free
elections earlier this year in which center-right parties won the
majority. Those elections marked the first free balloting in
Yugoslavia in 50 years.
   Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, has so far
resisted a multiparty system and Serbians recently voted in a
referendum for free elections to be postponed until after a new
constitution is adopted.
   Serbia will be the last republic to hold free elections,
probably next year.
   A new law, adopted by the Serbian Parliament in July, permits
the formation and registration of political parties in the republic
but bans political activity in factories and at the workplace.
   The move marked the first tentative step by Yugoslavia's
conservative republic toward a multiparty system.
   In a related development Tuesday, the assembly of the southern
republic of Montenegro also adopted amendments to its constitution
introducing political pluralism, Tanjug said.
   Elections are to be held in the republics of Montenegro and
Macedonia this year.

<HEAD>No Agreement on Next Summer's Cleanup From Exxon Valdez Oil Spill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Exxon-Inquiry, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the second summer of cleanup from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill nears an end, disputes are arising about
whether a third summer's work will be necessary.
   The Coast Guard's highest-ranking officer, Commandant Adm. J.
William Kime, said Sunday after a visit to Prince William Sound
that he saw enough oil to warrant the return of cleanup crews next
summer.
   But Exxon officials and others in the Coast Guard think Kime's
assessment is premature.
   ``There is a good likelihood no future work will be required in
1991,'' Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik said Tuesday.
   More than 1,000 people are working on the cleanup, according to
Exxon, which counts office workers and other shore personnel in
that total.
   The effort to mop up what's left of 11 million gallons of heavy
crude oil uses 31 aircraft and 66 boats.
   Exxon spokesman Frank Dobbs said cleanup efforts were ahead of
schedule everywhere but on Kodiak Island, where he said erratic
weather had hindered crews.
   By Tuesday, crews had finished cleaning 488 of about 600
targeted sites, Dobbs said.
   Exxon plans to begin scaling back operations in Prince William
Sound on Aug. 15, based on the onset of winter weather last year.
It will continue working through mid-September in the Gulf of
Alaska.
   Exxon wants to wait until after a shorline survey next spring to
decide if more work is needed, Rodvik said. Based on what happend
last winter, when storms and daily tides washed away much of the
oil, the company said there's a chance crews won't have to return
in 1991.
   Commissioner Dennis Kelso of the state's Department of
Environmental Conservation, and Environmental Protection Agency
chief William Reilly have already said the cleanup should continue
next summer.

<HEAD>Soviets Cut Rail Supplies to Georgia in Face of Internal Blockade</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM_Soviet-Food, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rail authorities suspended shipments to the
southern republic of Georgia because a political protest and strike
have halted virtually all trains traveling into the republic,
Soviet media reported Tuesday.
   Georgian activists began blocking the key railway junction of
Samtredia six days ago to protest what they see as Georgian
officials' attempts to block fair, multiparty elections scheduled
for October.
   Nearly 200 trains carrying 500,000 tons of cargo are stranded
and 40,000 passengers have been kept waiting, according to the
official news agency Tass and Soviet television news.
   On Tuesday, locomotive drivers in the Black Sea town of Sukhumi
went on strike, blocking all rail traffic on the coast. The
Georgian capital of Tbilisi is also blocked, the evening news show
Vremya reported.
   As a result, officials decided to ship food, gasoline, coal and
ore meant for Georgia to the other 14 republics.
   It is a harsh action in a country where everything is in short
supply.
   However, rail authorities' failure to alter train shipments in
the face of Azerbaijan's blockade of Armenia last year led to
hundreds of trains backing up on the rails to the Caucasus. That,
in turn, caused a shortage of railcars throughout the nation.
Thousands of tons of food shipments rotted.
   The blockade also threatens the harvest in the farming areas of
Georgia and Armenia, which produce much of the Soviet Union's fresh
fruits and vegetables, the Interfax and Tass news agencies reported
Tuesday.
   The Georgian blockade is particularly dangerous for Armenia.
With the Georgian link disrupted, Armenia is dependent on lines
through Azerbaijan, which were cut for two months last year as part
of the two republics' deadly territorial dispute.

   Here is a chronology of the nation's worst oil spill:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1989</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh
Reef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   March 26: Alaska fishermen's union spokeswoman Riki Ott says the
group wants full compensation for damage from the spill. More than
250 lawsuits will be filed against Exxon in the following months.
   March 30: Exxon fires tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood after
tests taken 10 hours after the accident find his blood-alcohol
level was .06 percent, above the Coast Guard's limit of .04 percent.
   April 4: U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan calls the spill
the oil industry's Three Mile Island. Oil covers 1,000 square
miles, leaking out of the sound to foul beaches along the Gulf of
Alaska and Cook Inlet.
   June 19: Exxon and other big oil companies announce plans for a
voluntary network of response teams capable of handling big spills
anywhere in U.S. coastal waters. Estimated cost: $250 million.
   Sept. 15: Exxon suspends its beach cleanup for the winter,
claiming it has left 1,100 miles of oiled beaches ``environmentally
stable'' and saying its 25-week cleanup involving more than 10,000
workers was a job well done. Alaska officials disagree and announce
their own $21 million winter cleanup plan.
   Oct. 10: State officials warn people not to consume shellfish in
areas affected by oil.
   Oct. 27: The National Wildlife Federation says Exxon has
resigned from its corporate advisory board. Exxon calls the
conservation group unfair in its criticism of the oil spill; the
group calls Exxon ``a corporate pariah.''
   Nov. 8: The U.S. House of Representatives passes a bill
preserving states' ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability
laws than the federal government. The Senate also is working on a
bill, but agreement is put off until 1990.
   Dec. 4: U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
Exxon's cleanup has cost the company $1.9 billion, and praises
Exxon for ``a very substantial, good-faith effort.''
   Dec. 31: Wildlife officials report that more than 1,000 sea
otters, 140 bald eagles and nearly 36,500 seabirds have been found
dead in the spill area.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1990</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 5: The Alaska Oil Spill Commission issues a report calling
for an overhaul of the nation's oil transportation system. It
blames the Valdez spill in part on the Coast Guard's ``unduly
friendly relationship with industry,'' and a reckless rush to
profits by the oil industry.
   Jan. 22: Hazelwood goes on trial in Anchorage on charges of
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of
oil, and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Feb. 20: The Coast Guard orders Exxon to resume its cleanup May
1 and to submit a plan by March 15.
   Feb. 27: A federal grand jury indicts Exxon and its shipping
subsidiary on five criminal counts. Officials say that if convicted
on all counts, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million and
could be assessed an additional $700 million in penalties.
   March 22: Jury finds Hazelwood guilty of negligent discharge of
oil but innocent of the more serious charges.

<HEAD>Military Disbands Alleged `Death Squad' Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military announced Tuesday
it was disbanding a controversial secret unit that opposition
leaders claimed was involved in the unsolved killings of
anti-apartheid activists.
   Opponents of the white-minority government had been demanding
President F.W. de Klerk disband the military's Civil Cooperation
Bureau as a signal that he was serious about curbing abuses by the
country's security forces.
   The chief of the Defense Forces, Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, said
the Civil Cooperation Bureau was being closed down and members were
being transferred to regular army units.
   Geldenhuys gave no reason for the decision.
   Opposition activists have accused the Civil Cooperation Bureau
and other branches of the security forces of involvement in the
killings of dozens of anti-apartheid figures in recent years.
   Anti-apartheid leaders welcomed the government's decision.
   ``The (bureau) was made up of people trained to kill, people
with tremendous vested interests in the status quo, and with an
interest in derailing the present (black-white) negotiating
process,'' said Denis Worrall, a co-leader of the liberal
Democratic Party.
   Murphy Morobe, spokesman for the anti-apartheid United
Democratic Front, said, ``the important thing is whether (the
bureau) has really been disbanded or whether it will be transformed
into the same beast under another guise.''
   De Klerk appointed a judicial commission in March to investigate
the killings of anti-apartheid activists.
   During weeks of testimony, top military officials have
acknowledged that the bureau, formed in the mid-1980s, bombed
anti-apartheid targets. The bureau also has claimed responsibility
for delivering a baboon fetus to the home of Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.
   But military officials have denied bureau involvement in
killings of opposition figures.
   The military has said the bureau had 139 members and an annual
budget of $11 million, and was engaged in highly sensitive
intelligence gathering operations in South Africa and abroad.
   However, Defense Minister Magnus Malan and other top military
officials have claimed they didn't know about the bureau until last
November.
   The judicial hearing into the unsolved killings of
anti-apartheid activists was scheduled to resume Wednesday after a
six-week break.
   In the past year, former policemen have said they were part of
authorized death squads that killed anti-apartheid figures. Police
have denied authorizing any killings.
   There has been no evidence directly linking the Civil
Cooperation Bureau to the alleged police death squads.
   Since assuming power last year, de Klerk has downgraded the role
of the security establishment, which figured far more prominently
under his predecessor, P.W. Botha.
   De Klerk says he wants to end the country's apartheid system of
racial segregation and negotiate a power-sharing agreement between
the 5 million whites and 30 million blacks.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem radicals freed an ailing
and wounded Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson on Tuesday, four
days after they took him and 40 other people hostage in a coup
attempt, the attorney general said.
   The other hostages, including 15 government officials, were
still held, Attorney General Anthony Smart said. He refused to say
what conditions led to the 63-year-old Robinson's release.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk confirmed
Robinson was freed and said, ``We hope the situation can be
resolved in a quick and peaceful manner.''
   But Smart told reporters, ``This crisis is far from over.''
   He said the government in this Caribbean nation of 1.3 million
residents was continuing efforts to win the release of the others
held by former policeman Abu Bakr and his band of Moslem extremists.
   ``These discussions are at a very delicate stage,'' with lives
at stake, he said.
   The hostages were seized Friday by extremists who captured the
Parliament building and the government TV station about one mile
away. At least nine people were yle.''
   Attorneys representing the families of Raymond Belknap and James
Vance claim those lines on the band's ``Stained Class'' album
contain the subliminal message ``do it'' that prompted the youths
to shoot themselves in a deserted church playground Dec. 23, 1985.
   Belknap, 18, died immediately. Vance, then 20, blew away most of
his face but lived three more years, undergoing several operations,
before he died on Thanksgiving Day 1988 of complications from his
injuries and the various medications he was taking.
   The band and CBS Records deny any hidden messages exist. They
counter that the supposed ``do it'' sounds are an exhalation of
breath, and a combination of drums, guitars and vocals.
   ``The sounds I hear are essentially my own exhalation of breath
at the end of the line I am singing,'' Halford testified.
   ``There are no subliminals of any nature'' either in the song or
on the album, he said.
   Halford testified that the song ``Better by You, Better than
Me,'' was the only song on the 1978 album that wasn't written by
band members.

<HEAD>Auditors Say Justice in the Dark on Debt Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department knows ``very little''
about the $5.5 billion of unpaid debts other government agencies
have referred to 94 U.S. attorneys for collection, auditors told
Congress Tuesday.
   A General Accounting Office review of the government's
debt-collection program found that the Justice Department has yet
to put in place a system to keep track of the growing number of
referrals of unpaid debts by other agencies.
   ``Our main concern is whether Justice has adequate systems and
plans for collecting this aging and growing debt,'' GAO auditor
Lowell Dodge told the House Govermnent Operations subcommittee on
government information, justice and agriculture.
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Robert E. Wise Jr., D-W.Va.,
asked Justice Department officials to consider a policy of
prohibiting travel by criminal defendants who owe large fines.
   Wise cited the case of former deputy White House chief of staff
Michael K. Deaver who received court permission earlier this year
to take his family on an eight-day trip to the Bahamas.
   Deaver, who was convicted of lying under oath about his lobbying
activities after leaving the White House, was fined $100,000 and
placed on probation. He was given until April 1992 to pay the fine
and has asked the court to reduce it to $25,000.
   When the probation department recommended that Deaver be given
permission to take the trip, it noted that he had paid only $2,350
of the fine, according to court records produced by Wise's staff.
   Justice Department officials said they would consider working
with court and probation officials to adopt a travel policy for
people who owe criminal fines.
   In its review, GAO found that the amount of uncollected debts
owed government agencies is growing rapidly. Debts that were
delinquent for at least a year grew from some $12 billion in 1983
to about $28 billion last year, GAO said.
   During the 1989 fiscal year, the nation's U.S. attorneys
collected $216 million while the department's civil division, which
litigates larger debts, had collected $346 million.
   But GAO said it didn't know the status of most of $5.5 billion
worth of debt referred for collection to U.S. attorneys.
   The Justice Department has information on the $1.1 billion it
has entered into its debt-collection system but it ``knows very
little about the $5.5 billion which has been referred to various
U.S. attorneys and is still in processing or litigation,'' Dodge
said.
   ``Justice does not have a system for tracking all referrals,''
Dodge said.
   The Justice Department failed to report to the Office of
Management and Budget as planned during the 1989 on long-range
plans for consolidating debt collection, GAO said.
   Justice Department officials have started to implement a
``central door'' program to keep track of all debts referred from
other agencies. But Dodge said that the department does not have a
written plan to make changes in its computer and accounting systems.
   ``We are concerned about whether Justice's informal planning
approach will be successful,'' Dodge said.
   Robert Ford, a deputy assistant attorney general for
debt-collection management, testified that the agency has collected
$3.5 billion since 1982.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Lewis Billups
will have to serve 30 days in jail for pointing a gun at two
undercover police officers, a Cincinnati judge said Tuesday.
   But because of the backlog in serving misdemeanor sentences, the
football player probably won't have to begin his term until late
January or early February, Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Ralph
Winkler said.
   Winkler sentenced Billups to 30 days in the Hamilton County
Justice Center on two counts of aggravated menacing, and fined him
$1,000 and court costs. He also sentenced Billups to 180 days in
jail _ but suspended 150 days of that sentence _ on a third
misdemeanor count of improper handling of a firearm while in a
motor vehicle.
   All three sentences will be served concurrently.
   Winkler said that even if jail space becomes available during
the National Football League season, he would delay Billups' jail
time.
   Billups, 25, is a four-year veteran the Bengals drafted in 1986
from North Alabama. He is involved with a contract dispute with the
Bengals, and has not reported to their training camp at Wilmington
College.
   All of the charges stem from a Jan. 4 incident when two
Cincinnati police officers said that Billups pointed a pistol at
them, then led them on a high-speed chase into suburban northern
Kentucky, where Billups lives.
   Billups had pleaded guilty to the three first-degree misdemeanor
charges, and Ohio prosecutors dropped a felony charge of carrying a
concealed weapon.

<HEAD>Iranian Woman Wins Fight in Canada to Remain Unveiled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian woman got word Tuesday she will be
allowed to remain in Canada despite her refusal to obey Immigration
Department orders and wear a veil for a passport photo.
   ``It's really great for me - it's another life for me,'' said
Azita Zandian, 25.
   She said one reason she came to Canada a year ago was to escape
harsh rules imposed upon women in Iran.
   ``I don't want to put on a veil. That's why I left my country,''
Ms. Zandian said. ``All the world says Canada is freedom. I come
here and they tell me I must put a veil on my head. I'm really
confused.''
   Federal Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall made the decision
to allow Ms. Zandian to remain in Canada on compassionate grounds.
   The Iranian woman arrived here with a false passport and faced
deportation proceedings. She asked to stay here as a refugee but
was turned down.
   Iranian women are not issued passports unless their pictures
show them veiled. The Immigration Department wanted Ms. Zandian to
put on the head covering so it could supply the Iranian Embassy in
Ottawa with pictures for an Iranian passport and then deport her.
   Last week, Ms. Zandian was called to the immigration office and
told to bring a veil. She showed up without one. Officials told her
to return on Thursday with two pictures of herself wearing a veil.
She said she wouldn't. On Tuesday, she learned she had won her
fight.
   ``It's so nice to have a happy ending,'' said Mona Forest,
director of the Women's Center of Montreal, which supported Ms.
Zandian and her lawyer Gisele Saint-Pierre in the case.

   An explosion ripped through a coal mine
Tuesday, killing three miners and injuring two, officials said.
   The explosion occurred as workers were blasting with dynamite to
expose a coal seam in the small mine in Granny Rose Hollow in
southeastern Kentucky, said Nancy Toombs, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Mines and Minerals.
   Miners often detonate dynamite and other explosives to expose a
coal seam, she said. Five miners were underground during the
explosion.
   The three dead were found about 500 feet underground, said
county coroner Jerry Garland. Their names weren't immediately
released.
   The two injured were listed in stable condition at Knox County
General Hospital.
   In a radio interview from his hospital bed, David Faulkner, 32,
of Siler, said he was 150 feet from the explosion and was overcome
by smoke when he tried to rescue the victims.
   There was conflicting information Tuesday about the name of the
mine.
   The state mining department said the explosion occurred in mine
No. 1 of the Big Mama Coal Co. However, the U.S. Mine Safety and
Health Administration listed it as the No. 3 mine of the Granny
Rose Coal Co., said spokeswoman Kathy Snyder.
   Federal records indicated the non-union mine had a 24-inch-high
coal seam and had passed recent inspections, said Snyder.
   Toombs said the mine was icensed by the state.
   The state mines department, the federal mining agency and
Kentucky State Police were investigating the explosion.
   Kentucky's last multiple-death coal mine accident occurred in
September 1989, when 10 miners were killed in a methane blast at
the Pyro Mining Co.'s Wheatcroft Mine in western Kentucky.
   Eight men have died in mining accidents in Kentucky so far this
year.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Insurance to Pay for Bone Marrow Transplant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge on Tuesday ordered an insurance
company to pay for a bone marrow transplant that doctors said may
save the life of a man with an AIDS-related illness.
   Supreme Court Justice Elliott Wilk rejected the contention by
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield that the operation, used for
years to treat people with impaired immune systems, was
experimental when used to treat AIDS.
   Wilk issued a preliminary order directing Empire Blue Cross and
Blue Shield to pay the estimated $150,000 cost of the operation for
Thomas Bradley.
   His physician, Dr. H. Kent Holland of Johns Hopkins Oncology
Center in Baltimore, said in a sworn statement that Bradley's
condition was deteriorating and that the New York man could soon
become too weak to survive the transplant.
   ``Time is therefore of the essence,'' Holland said.
   Bradley, 46, was about to undergo the operation earlier this
month when the insurance company notified him it would not cover
experimental procedures.
   Wilk's decision sends a message that a treatment ``doesn't
become experimental all over again just because it's being used to
treat AIDS,'' said Bradley's lawyer, Evan Wolfson.
   The insurance company said in a statement that it would consider
appealing the ruling.
   ``Despite our real sympathy for Mr. Bradley, we have an
obligation to safeguard the resources entrusted to us by millions
of subscribers to cover medical care that's been proven beneficial
and appropriate,'' said spokesman John Kelly.
   Bradley, an administrator in the Suffolk County school district
of Bayport-Blue Point, wanted to have bone marrow transplant as
soon as possible, said Wolfson.
   Bradley had a 90 percent chance of surviving the operation,
which could extend his life by at least two years, Holland said in
his statement.
   His donor is his identical twin, Bob, a teacher in the same
district. Doctors said the fact that the two are identical twins
should greatly enhance the chances for success.
   Bradley learned he was infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, in 1986 and has a severely depressed immune system. He was

<HEAD>Palestinians Form Committee to Deal with Killing Collaborators</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising said
Tuesday they were forming a ``Higher Judicial Committee'' to try to
reduce the killings by Palestinians of Arabs suspected of
collaborating with Israel.
   The announcement came in a leaflet distributed in the occupied
territories and signaled the first national institution to be
founded for the would-be ``State of Palestine.''
   The insurgency against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip began in December 1987 and is backed by the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Leaders of the uprising acted amid a rise in the murders of
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   In July, Palestinians killed 15 fellow Arabs for informing or
collaborating in other ways, according to figures compiled by The
Associated Press.
   In contrast, three Palestinians died in July as a result of
clashes with Israeli troops, and a fourth Arab was killed in a
prison breakout, according to the Israeli Information Center for
Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.
   The four fatalities constitute the lowest one-month death toll
since the uprising began, officials at the human right group said.
   During the uprising, 725 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers and civilians and 45 Israelis have been killed by
Palestinians. A further 243 Palestinians were slain by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating.
   The judicial committee appeared to be a first step by local
Palestinians toward creating a bureaucracy to deal with internal
problems.
   Most Palestinians reject dealings with Israeli police and
military courts, especially after the PLO declared an independent
state in the occupied lands in 1988.
   Israel rejects formation of a Palestinian state. Many Third
World countries recognize the would-be state, but not major Western
governments.
   The leaflet said the Higher Judicial Committee ``will establish
legal procedures for the State of Palestine, including those which
pertain to interrogations'' of suspected collaborators.
   It said operating details would be announced later, but
meanwhile, ``correct methods'' should be used in interrogations and
members of one faction should not investigate the activities of
other factions.
   The leaflet condemned torture in interrogations, saying ``It is
incomprehensible that we should use such methods when we ourselves
are the victims of such methods at the hands of the Israelis.''
   Palestinians repeatedly complain of Israeli beatings, solitary
confinement and other punishment to force confessions. Israel
denies using torture.
   Many suspected collaborators were brutally killed after harsh
interrogations.
   Radwan Abu Ayyash, chief of the Arab Journalists Association in
the West Bank, said a judicial committee likely would be made up of
lawyers and traditional village judges ``who would investigate
incidents and determine what kind of action should be taken.''
   He suggested such a panel could deal with land disputes, theft
and the like, as well as cases of suspected collaborators.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _Three Palestinian truck drivers from Jericho in the West Bank
were charged in a West Bank military court with plotting to
assassinate Foreign Minister David Levy.
   _A military court in Lod, within Israel, charged a 40-year-old
mother of 12 children with carrying messages and money for the
PLO's Fatah faction.
   _A 7-year-old Israeli boy was seriously hurt in Hebron in the
West Bank when hit in the head by a stone thrown at the car he was
riding in, the army said.
   _Army gunfire wounded at least seven Palestinians during
stone-throwing clashes in the occupied territories, including a
12-year-old boy shot in the head with a plastic bullet and listed
in serious condition, Arab and Israeli reports said. The army said
it was checking the reports.

   Police killed four suspected car
thieves and wounded a bystander in a shootout on the city's major
north-south highway during the Tuesday afternoon rush hour.
   In another incident, gunmen halted a staff car of an Arab
embassy and stole the embassy payroll.
   Such violent incidents have undermined public confidence in the
government of President Corazon Aquino.
   The shootout occurred along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in
suburban Makati, which was packed with commuters returning home
from work.
   Patrolman Abner Apuang said he and three other policemen were
cruising down the avenue when they saw a jeep carrying men they
suspected were members of a car theft ring.
   When the jeep sped away, the police opened fire, killing four
occupants and critically wounding the driver, police said. Three
other suspects escaped.
   Police saw a construction worker dive for cover beneath a parked
truck and, thinking he was part of the gang, wounded him in the
shoulder, police said.
   The shootout caused a huge traffic jam, and bodies lay along the
median strip of the eight-lane highway.
   A few hours earlier, robbers armed with pistols stole more than
$5,000 in U.S. and Filipino currency after stopping a car belonging
to the embassy of the United Arab Emirates.
   Maj. Venerando Minas said the assailants' car overtook the
diplomatic vehicle just after the embassy accountant had left a
bank with the staff payroll.

<TEXT>
   Political leaders of the 13 Caribbean
economic community members began a three-day meeting Tuesday,
saying their countries were in danger of being overwhelmed by
global changes.
   The speakers at the opening session also condemned the attempted
coup in Trinidad and Tobago, a member of Caricom.
   Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson, who
was released Tuesday after being held hostage by members of a Black
Muslim group for five days, was scheduled to attend the summit.
   His seat at the opening session was taken by Sahadeo Basdeo, the
country's foreign minister.
   ``Any criminal violation of democracy is repugnant,'' said
Barbados Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford. ``It must not happen
again, and we in Caricom must ensure that it does not.''
   The annual summit of Caricom began with calls by several leader
for further integration of economies to provide a basis for dealing
with the changes.
   Mexico answered the call by signing an agreement with the
Caricom to promote trade and increase economic cooperation in the
region, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gotari announced
Tuesday.
   Salinas de Gotari told the opening session of Caricom's annual
Heads of Government meeting that the agreement had been signed
between Caricom and Bancomext, the Mexican foreign trade bank.
   In addition to cooperation within the region, ``we are
determined to strengthen the role we play in the work of the
Caribbean Dvelopment Bank, and to identify new opportunities for
cooperation,'' the Mexican leader said.
   The Barbados-based Development Bank provides financial support
for the English-speaking Caribbean states. Mexico is a contributing
member of the institution.
   Caricom, which was created in 1973, aims at establishing a
regional common market by 1993.
   Its members are the English-speaking states of the Caribbean,
including Belize in Central America, the Bahamas, and Guyana in
South America. Mexico is not currently a member, and a Caricom
secretariat official said on condition he not be named that
Mexico's application for observer status would not be discussed
until next year's summit.

   Cambodia's ruling Communist Party has
purged Ung Phan, the former minister of transport, communications
and posts who was arrested in May for trying to form a rival party.
   The government radio said Ung Phan was expelled from the party's
policy-making Central Committee ``due to his betrayal of the party
and the nation's historic tasks.''
   It said his actions caused a split in the forces opposing the
Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting the
Vietnamese-installed government.
   A text of the Monday broadcast was seen Tuesday.
   The radio said the expulsion came at a Central Committee meeting
from July 23 to 30.
   At least five other government and military officials also were
arrested, the U.S. human rights group Asia Watch has said.
   Asia Watch said Ung Phan and the others were accused of trying
to form the Liberal Social Democratic Party.
   In what appeared a reference to these arrests, the authorities
said in June they had foiled a coup attempt.
   The one-party administration was installed after Vietnam invaded
Cambodia in late 1978, and ended the bloody regime of the Khmer
Rouge.

   Scores of anti-government
demonstrators rallied Tuesday night in University Square in the
capital center, site of a 53-day demonstration that was violently
broken up by police in mid-June.
   Protesters earlier roped off the square and put up a sign
declaring it a ``neo-Communist free zone,'' as was the case during
the previous demonstration.
   Police later took down the ropes, leading to a scuffle between
demonstrators and a man they suspected of being a police informer.
   State-run TV reported the incident hours later and said a police
lieutenant colonel was ``attacked'' by a group of people.
   The demonstrators disbanded at about 11 p.m. after painting
slogans on a wall demanding the release of jailed student leader
Marian Munteanu.
   Munteanu was a leader of the anti-Communist rally that blocked
the capital's main thoroughfare during the election campaign. The
demonstrators demanded the resignation of President Ion Iliescu, a
former Communist official.

   A 500,000-gallon oil spill unleashed by
a ship-barge collision could be an evironmental disaster in the
rich fishing grounds and teeming wildlife habitats of Galveston
Bay, a state official said Tuesday.
   The spill began Saturday when a tanker ship struck two barges in
the Houston Ship Channel, which is in part dredged though the bay.
   By Tuesday, a 17-mile-long slick had formed. Heavy oil had
washed up on a dike in Texas City about three miles northwest of
Galveston and on a nearby peninsula and island, the Coast Guard
said.
   The deaths of two seabirds were blamed on the spill, which has
already killed an undetermined number of fish.
   The Houston Ship Channel, closed since the spill began, partly
reopened during the afternoon. Dozens of ships have been prevented
from leaving or reaching Houston at an estimated cost of $1.5
million a day.
   Another Texas official criticized what he characterized as a
lack of response to the disaster.
   Galveston Bay is protected from the Gulf of Mexico by barrier
islands which contain delicate nesting grounds for birds and other
wildlife. The bay _ the richest estuary on the Gulf Coast _ is an
important fishing ground for shrimp and other commercially valuable
species.
   Experts fear the spill will take a heavy environmental toll,
both because the oil is thick and because it is unlikely to
dissipate in the enclosed waters, as did the light crude spilled in
the gulf by the tanker Mega Borg in June.
   ``The worst kind of spill you can have is one behind these
barrier islands, which is what we've got,'' said Larry McKinney,
director of resource protection for the Texas Department of Parks
and Wildlife.
   McKinney predicted the spill would rank as the worst in the gulf
region.
   At least 100 bird species, including the endangered brown
pelican, and at least 75 kinds of fish inhabit the Galveston Bay
area, he said.
   Cleanup crews used five skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck to
suck up oil contained by thousands of feet of booms. By Monday
night, about 20,000 gallons of oil had been cleaned up. The Coast
Guard did not have an updated figure for Tuesday.
   Workers also began cleaning crude on the dike and at the Port
Bolivar and on Pelican Island, next to Galveston Island.
   ``This is a mess. I have never in my 25 years being out here
seen this dike look like this,'' said Darnell Vaughn of La Marque,
who had her children Rachel, 8, and Jerod, 12, with her.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Jim Loy, who flew in from New Orleans to
survey the spill, said a flyover convinced him the situation was
under control.
   ``It's a very manageable situation, perhaps not being managed as
well as it could be,'' Loy told a news conference.
   He said he saw streaks of black oil at Eagle Point, a
residential development with private docks 22 miles north of
Galveston, that cleanup crews should have been attacking. Heavy
black oil was reported on sandy beaches there Tuesday morning.
   Loy said he'd suggested that cleanup contractors bring in about
five more skimmers, but said barge owner Apex Towing Co. had been
doing a good job generally of keeping the oil from environmentally
sensitive areas.
   ``I want to strike while the iron's hot,'' he said. ``We're
never going to get better weather conditions than we have right
now.''
   Coast Guard officials said a hearing to determine the cause of
the accident would begin Wednesday morning.
   In another development, state officials urged the federal
government to let them use oil-eating microbes on the spill before
the oil reached the environmentally sensitive marshes.
   ``Once it gets to the marshland, trying to clean up the marsh is
almost impossible. So why not try it?'' McKinney said. ``It's not
going to hurt anything.''
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Roger Meacham in
Dallas said the technique known as bioremediation is promising, but
that not enough information exists on its effectiveness or its
impact on marine life to endorse its large-scale use in every
situation.
   Texas Water Commission Chairman B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne, Texas Land
Commission representative Blanton Moore and McKinney met with Coast
Guard Capt. Thomas Greene in Galveston to discuss the proposal.
   Greene said the Coast Guard was hesitant to grant permission.
``We want to be careful there isn't something else introduced into
the area that could cause more problems,'' he said.
   In Austin, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro criticized the response
to the spill.
   ``The point is this oil spill occurred Saturday at 2:30 (p.m.).
All these decisions should have been made in advance of this
spill,'' Mauro told a news conference.
   ``We're not happy with that either,'' said Coast Guard Chief
Petty Officer Todd Nelson.
   The Greek tanker Shinoussa collided with two of three barges
being towed by the tugboat Chandy N south of Redfish Island 15
miles north of Galveston.
   One barge nearly sank and the other listed. Both spewed
``catfeed'' oil, a refinery oil similar to No. 5 oil, into the bay.
The double-hulled tanker did not lose any of its 29,400-metric-ton
load of jet fuel.
   No oil has spilled since Monday evening, Nelson said.
   Divers continued strapping slings beneath the submerged barge
Tuesday so cranes could lift the vessel as water and oil were
pumped off, Nelson said.
   The ship channel reopened to one-way, incoming barge traffic,
Greene said. Up to 30 barges have been stacked up along the
Intracoastal Canal near Galveston and about 70 more waited further
down the canal, he said.
   After clearing incoming barge traffic, the Coast Guard planned
to allow some one-way barge traffic out of the channel.
   In addition to the barges, up to 60 ships were waiting to get in
the channel and about as many were waiting to leave, Greene said.
   The disruption is costing about $1.5 million a day, said West
Gulf Maritime Association President Ted Thorjunssen.
   ``There is a little bit of everything out there _ oil, steel and
general cargo,'' said Carl Bond, operations manager for the Marine
Exchange.

<TEXT>
   George Steinbrenner, stripped by the baseball
commissioner of his right to run the Yankees, said Tuesday he wants
his son to succeed him.
   Also Tuesday, Commissioner Fay Vincent revealed that he had
planned only to suspend George Steinbrenner, but the Yankees owner
asked for what amounted to a lifetime ban.
   The action against Steinbrenner on Monday ends a stormy 17{-year
reign punctuated by numerous firings of managers and feuds with
players, including onetime star outfielder Dave Winfield.
   Vincent punished Steinbrenner for besmirching the image of
baseball by paying known gambler Howard Spira $40,000. It had been
suggested the payments were in exchange for information on Winfield
that Steinbrenner could use to force the player to accept a trade
that his contract allows him to refuse.
   In a session Tuesday with several reporters, Vincent suggested
the penalty he planned to impose was for a fixed term and was less
severe than the punishment Steinbrenner agreed to after 11 hours of
negotiations Monday.
   ``I have to say to you I found some aspects of yesterday strange
and I still find them strange this morning,'' Vincent said.
   A baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said Vincent had proposed suspending Steinbrenner for two years and
putting him on three years' probation.
   Steinbrenner agreed to give up control of the team and resign as
general partner by Aug. 20.
   On Tuesday, the commissioner placed the Yankees under American
League supervision for the next five years. He also barred all
contact between Steinbrenner and the team without Vincent's
permission. That would apply to Steinbrenner's son if he became
manager.
   Steinbrenner confirmed Tuesday that he wants his 33-year-old
son, Hank, to take over the day-to-day operations of the Yankees.
The move, already cleared by Vincent, must still be approved by the
team's limited partners and major league clubs.
   ``I have no desire to return as general partner,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``That will rest with my sons. I have other endeavors which I
plan to devote most of my available time to now, which are very
important to me.''
   Vincent ordered that for five years the Yankees must seek league
approval for ``the hiring, firing, promotion, demotion or
reassignment of any officer of the club.'' During that time, the
team also must ask league approval to sue or file a grievance
against a player and to hire lawyers and investigators involved
with player dealings.
   Steinbrenner would be allowed to consult with team managers in
four areas: television and radio contracts, concessions agreements,
governmental and lease agreements and banking relationships.
   Vincent also barred Phil McNiff, the American Shipbuilding Co.
executive who headed Steinbrenner's investigation of Winfield, from
having anything to do with the Yankees. Winfield eventually was
traded to California.
   McNiff supervised Steinbrenner's relationship with Spira, who is
under an eight-count federal indictment for attempting to extort
the Yankees owner and for threatening Steinbrenner and Winfield.
   Steinbrenner's baseball problems could affect his position as a
vice president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
   USOC President Robert Helmick said the organization's executive
committee will review Steinbrenner's status at its next regular
meeting, Aug. 22 in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   ``When the head of a major sport in the United States says an
individual has operated contrary to the best interests of that
sport, obviously we must be very concerned,'' Helmick said.

   The military said Tuesday that 44 leftist
rebels and seven soldiers were killed in three separate clashes
during the past week in a coca-growing region of central Peru.
   On Monday, a military patrol killed 17 guerrillas from the
extremist Shining Path group, a communique said.
   A Sunday clash left 15 guerrillas and an army sergeant dead, it
said.
   The military said that 12 rebels and six soldiers were killed in
a clash that broke out on Thursday after the guerrillas ambushed an
army patrol 300 miles northeast of Lima.
   The secretive Shining Path guerrillas control much of central
Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, the world's main source of coca leaf,
the raw material used in processing cocaine. Authorities say the
guerrillas participate in the drug trade.
   Shining Path, which says it follows the precepts of China's late
Mao Tse-tung, has waged a 10-year-old insurgency to overthrow the
government that has resulted in 19,000 deaths.

<HEAD>Accused Cocaine Dealer Pleads Guilty in DEA Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man pleaded guilty to charges he
bombed a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office, distributed
cocaine and was involved in a federal witness' death, prosecutors
said Tuesday.
   Jeffrey Alan Matthews, 23, formerly known as Jeffrey Ciganek,
could face up to life in prison without parole at his sentencing
set for Sept. 1 before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich,
according to a release from the U.S. attorney's office.
   ``We will not permit this country to become like some others,
where self-styled drug lords can bomb criminal justice facilities
at their leisure,'' said Allen McCreight, the area's top FBI agent.
   Matthews pleaded guilty to charges of supervising a continuing
criminal enterprise, homicide to further that enterprise, cocaine
trafficking and the March 17 bombing in this Gulf Coast city, the
release said. The charge of running a continuing criminal
enterprise is the nation's most serious drug-related offense.
   The pleas were entered Monday, but prosecutors delayed
announcing them until Tuesday for ``law enforcement purposes,'' the
release said.
   The bombing came only two days after federal drug indictments
were issued against Matthews, his brother John Lewis Ciganek and
two others. Matthews was arrested at an Orlando convenience store
25 days after the bombing.
   He was the only person charged in the bombing, which caused
damages estimated at $4 million but no injuries. Authorities said
it was the first time a DEA office had been bombed in the United
States.
   According to prosecutors, Matthews has been distributing
multikilogram quantities of cocaine in the Fort Myers area for at
least five years.
   Last January, federal witness Stephen Franken was murdered. In
his plea, Matthews admitted to inducing, commanding or causing the
death in furtherance of his cocaine-trafficking activities.
   Matthews remains jailed without bond pending his sentencing. His
brother awaits trial only on the drug charges Sept. 10.

<TEXT>
   Central American officials met here
Tuesday to explore ways of cutting their armed forces to improve
regional security.
   The meeting results from an accord reached by Central American
presidents during an April summit in Montelimar, Nicaragua. The
presidents agreed to attempt to reduce the size of their countries'
armies.
   ``Armaments should be limited and there should be action for
verification and control that can be an adequate response to the
interests of all the countries,'' Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bern
Niehaus said.
   A Costa Rican foreign ministry official, requesting anonymity,
said the officials hoped to revive a regional security commission
with the participation of the Organization of American States.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, head of the Nicaraguan army, said before
the meeting that it ``is very important for regional peace because
all of us have promised to reduce our armies and create mechanisms
of verification and arms control.''
   He said his own country has made large cuts in its own army,
considered the largest in Central America. The reductions followed
the defeat of the leftist Sandinista government February's
elections and a peace agreement that has led to the disarming of
U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   ``In the last three months, our army has been reduced from
96,000 to 46,000 men ... and we hope to cut it more,'' Ortega said.
   Guatemala's deputy foreign minister, Mario Rosal, said he was
optimistic the meeting would ``advance the subject of security for
the countries and reduction of the armies, as well as arms
control.''
   Other countries represented at the meeting were El Salvador and
Panama.

<HEAD>Leader of Cargo Door Search Believes Deep-Sea Debris From United
Jet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE ELLIOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debris found on the ocean floor 90 miles south
of here probably fell from a United Airlines jumbo jet that ripped
open last year, the leader of the deep-sea search said Tuesday.
   ``I would say it's a very good chance _ better than 50 percent _
it's the debris field from the jet,'' said Bob Whaley, leader of
the search.
   The largest piece of debris, a metal object about 10 feet long,
is roughly the size of the 10-by-10-foot cargo door that tore away
from the Boeing 747 along with a chunk of fuselage, sweeping nine
passengers to their deaths, Whaley said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board asked the Navy to find
the cargo door in hopes an examination of it would help the agency
write better aviation safety rules.
   It's up to the NTSB to decide if there should be an attempt to
retrieve the debris. The agency hadn't made a decision by late
Tuesday, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson, a Navy spokesman.
   Whaley said several factors make him think the debis is from
United Flight 811.
   _ The debris was found in an area where Navy radar tracked the
door falling into the ocean.
   _ The bottom, nearly 15,000 feet down, is flat and silty. Older
objects on the ocean floor probably would have sunk into the silt.
   _ The largest piece roughly matches the size of the cargo door.
   _ The debris field, about three miles long, runs north to south,
the direction the plane was traveling.
   Searchers aboard a 224-foot Navy tug used a small,
remote-controlled, deep-sea submarine to find the debris.
   The sub's sonar located the debris, but searchers were unable to
get a picture with the sub's video camera to help confirm whether
the debris is from the jet.
   The jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it left Honolulu for
New Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.
   Shortly after takeoff, a cargo door opened at 22,000 feet,
tearing away a section of fuselage. Nine people were swept to their
deaths and five others suffered serious injuries. The crew managed
to return the jet to Honolulu.
   The NTSB inquiry determined that faulty design of the locking
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the
door was locked.
   The agency blamed United, Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to correct problems with the door.
   The search, which began a week ago, covered a 24-square-mile
section of ocean floor.

<HEAD>Radio Says Acting President Named To Fill In For Nabijullah</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Baker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kabul Radio said Tuesday that Abdul
Rahim Hatif, deputy vice president of Afghanistan, will head the
government while President Najibullah is away on a brief trip to
the Soviet Union.
   The state radio's announcement was monitored in Islamabad.
   Najibullah, who uses only one name, flew to Moscow on Sunday for
official meetings and a medical checkup. The unexpected visit led
to speculation that the United States and the Soviet Union had
reached an agreement on how to end the 12-year-old war in
Afghanistan.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will discuss Afghanistan during two
days of talks in the Siberian city of Irkutsk beginning Wednesday.
   Like Najibullah's trip, Hatif's appointment as acting president
took many people by surprise.
   Such appointments are rarely made during a short trip by the
president and Hatif's selection apparently bypassed Najibullah's
second-in-command, Sultan Ali Keshtmand.
   Keshtmand, seen as a hard-line member of the ruling party, was
appointed two months ago to the newly created post of first vice
president.
   Hatif, 64, is not a member of the ruling Hezb-e-Watan, or Party
of the Homeland, which until last month was known as the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   But Hatif was brought into the Soviet-backed government in 1987
as the party sought to broaden its base of support and initiated
efforts to distance itself from the bloody Marxist past.
   Hatif had served under former King Zahir Shah, who was
overthrown by his cousin Mohammad Daoud in 1973 and has been living
in exile in Italy.
   Daoud was killed during the 1978 coup that installed a Marxist
government and brought the Red Army into Afghanistan a year later.
   Soviet troops remained in Afghanistan for nine years to fight
Moslem guerrillas. Moscow ended direct military involvement in
February 1989 but continues to supply the Kabul government with
weapons and ammunition.
   The conflict has become a stalemate, with soldiers holding the
cities and guerrillas controlling the countryside.

   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council led by
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal accused Belgium's government on
Tuesday of obstructing the release of four Belgian hostages.
   ``We hold the Belgian government responsible for hampering and
frustrating efforts to reach a happy ending for the Silco boat
hostages,'' said a Fatah-RC statement issued in Beirut.
   The statement charged Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens was
``out to slander our movement by leaking reports of disunity
amongst us that is delaying the release of the Belgians.''
   The four Belgians were part of group that Fatah-RC said it
seized aboard the French yacht Silco in 1987 off Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip.
   They are Emmanuel Houtekins, 44; Godelieve Kets, 50; his son
Laurent, 20; and daughter, Valerie, 18.
   The rest of the group, a French woman and three daughters, plus
her Belgian boyfriend, have already been released.

   Three Soviet warships steamed into San Diego
Harbor on Tuesday, greeted by 21-gun salutes, curious citizenry and
a Greenpeace anti-nuclear flotilla.
   Admirals from both sides exchanged talk of international
cooperation and joint military exercises. The sailors swapped sea
stories, hats and pins.
   ``It's great to share ideas about the things that they do and
what we do,'' said Boatsmate 2 Regiald White, 23, who chatted with
the Soviets through an interpreter about the price of uniforms and
seamen's pay.
   ``They really like meeting people,'' said White, who hails from
Houston. ``I think this visit will show people that we can get
along together.''
   Two Soviet destroyers, Admiral Vinogradov and the Boyevoy, and
the supply ship Argun docked Tuesday morning, in the second such
port visit of glasnost era.
   After a 30-minute ceremony punctuated by a flyover from the
Navy's Blue Angels precision aerobatics team, U.S. and Soviet
sailors mingled on a pier separating their ships.
   A swarm of Greenpeace groups met the ships, carrying the group's
anti-nuclear message. Members of the group said they weren't
protesting the visit _ though the ships presumably are capable of
carrying nuclear weapons _ but were using the occasion to promote
their position.
   Adm. Gennady Khvatov, commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet,
spoke of the benefits of warming superpower relations.
   ``I think we have a good prospect for cooperation between the
fleets that possibly could lead to military exercises,'' Khvatov
said. ``There have been changes and we are trying to view each
other as friends, instead of foes.''
   The thawing of the Cold War, an ongoing economic crisis in the
Soviet Union and glasnost has led to a scaling down of the Soviet
military that Khvatov said would reduce the size of his fleet.
   The visit is mostly a goodwill tour, but the Soviets will visit
three U.S. Navy host ships, area military installations and tourist
attractions. American and Soviet sailors also will compete in
volleyball and soccer matches.
   The three U.S. ships hosting the Soviets are the USS Merrill, a
destroyer; the USS McClusky, a guided-missile frigate; and the USS
Leahy, a cruiser. The official host for the visit is Adm. Charles
R. Larson, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   ``My goal is to create a better understanding between us,''
Larson said. ``We may not agree on everything, but this gives us an
opportunity to understand where we both are coming from.''
   Soviet officials gave reporters, military officials and VIPs
tours of the decks of their destroyers, showing off the firepower
and handing out Soviet literature.
   Area residents have volunteered to serve as translators, and
about 8,000 others were lucky enough to land free tickets to tour
one of the Soviet ships Wednesday through Friday.
   The visit is the Soviet navy's second to the United States since
Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Marshall Sergei Akhromeyev, former Soviet chief of staff, met
in 1988 to set the groundwork for the exchanges.
   Three Soviet ships visited Norfolk, Va., last July and three
U.S. warships visited the Black Sea port of Sevastopol last August.
Three ships from the U.S. Pacific Fleet are scheduled to make a
similar visit Sept. 10-14 to Vladivostok, the Soviet Union's main
Pacific port.

<HEAD>Japan's Kaifu Accepts Electoral Reform Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu accepted on Tuesday
proposals to reduce the role of political parties and
special-interest money in elections to the upper house of
Parliament, officials said.
   The recommendations, offered by the Electoral Review Committee,
mark a step toward political reform in Japan following scandals
that caused two prime ministers to resign last year. The committee
was set up in June 1989 to lessen the power of money in Japanese
politics.
   The government plans to draw up legislation based on the
proposals, but opposition is strong and analysts believe it
unlikely the government will adopt the proposals without change.
   The report recommended keeping the mixed system of national and
regional constituencies used in selecting the 252 delegates to the
upper house, but suggested voters be allowed to choose candidates
by name when voting in the national constituencies.
   That would decrease the role of parties and increase the
importance of policy in campaigning, the council argued. Critics of
Japan's political system frequently cite lack of substantive policy
debate during electioneering.
   The report suggested the government provide more money for
candidates to lessen their dependence on outside financing.
   It recommended toughening election laws and requiring stricter
reporting on the use of political funds.
   Kaifu pledged political reform to restore the prestige of his
Liberal Democratic Party and trust in the government. He became
prime minister last August after his two predecessors resigned in
quick succession over money and sex scandals.
   Earlier proposals from the committee constituted a plan to
reshape the more powerful lower house. The panel suggested
reformulating Japan's system of multiple-seat constitutencies to
bring greater equality, to reduce politicians' ability to raise
money on their own and to tighten rules on reporting political
donations.

<HEAD>EPA Issues Smog-Cutting Proposals Including Some Bans on Driving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
issued a wide-ranging smog-cutting plan Tuesday that includes a
proposal to ban driving on some days in the region with the
nation's dirtiest air.
   The court-ordered plan is aimed at cutting ozone in Los Angeles
to 14 percent of current levels by early next century, and is a
backup to one approved in 1989 by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District. Ozone is a major component of smog.
   The plan stemmed from an environmentalist lawsuit filed against
1982 district air quality standards, guidelines that current
officials of the regional agency call timid. They were superseded
by stronger local rules last year.
   The district's current three-year plan affects everything from
lawnmowers to petroleum refineries at an estimated cost of $2.62
billion a year.
   Later steps of that plan include the use of technology not yet
developed, making its effectiveness a guessing game.
   The district covers Orange County and parts of Los Angeles, San
Bernardino and Riverside counties, an area where more than 12
million people live in the worst air pollution in the country. In
1988, the most recent year available, Los Angeles exceeded the
national standard for ozone 150 times, compared with 20 times for
New York and Chicago.
   The most stringent sections of the EPA plan, which doesn't
become final until next year, won't go into effect until after
1995. The entire plan would take effect only if state and regional
governments fail to significantly reduce smog.
   ``State and local authorities have been engaged in an
extraordinary effort to address this problem themselves, which we
all hope will render a federal plan as unnecessary,'' EPA Western
Regional Administrative Director Daniel W. McGovern told a downtown
news conference.
   Environmentalists who brought the lawsuit characterized the EPA
plan as insurance to make the district deliver.
   ``We have been very concerned that the local district has been
backsliding,'' said Coalition for Clean Air President Jan
Chatten-Brown, whose organization was a plaintiff with the Sierra
Club. ``This plan will send a clear message ... if the district
won't do the job, the EPA will step in.''
   The EPA guidelines include a reluctant proposal for no-drive
days to reduce carbon monoxide. Under such a plan, motorists with
odd numbers on their license plates would be permitted to drive
every other day and those with even tag numbers on another.
   The no-drive days would be enforced from November through
February, and would force affected commuters to find some other way
to work, either through car pools or mass transit.
   ``It is in the spirit of presenting all possibilities that we
are presenting the no-drive day ... it is not one we are
endorsing,'' said McGovern.
   The no-drive plan could be used by the year 2000 if other
methods fail.
   The federal plan takes longer to achieve goals set by the
regional agency. The district plan calls for reducing current ozone
averages by 86 percent in 2007; the EPA by 2010.
   ``It is our hope and expectation that the state plan will
achieve its goals well in advance of the federal plan,'' McGovern
said.
   The EPA will not use its proposed backup system until 1996 at
the earliest because of confidence in current efforts, said David
Howekamp, chief of air and toxics for the agency.
   He said the agency will be measuring pollution levels to
determine whether the EPA should begin enforcing its proposed
regulations.
   Some features of the EPA backup plan include:
   _ Mandatory reduction of emissions by 6 percent a year from
pollution sources such as consumer products, industrial and
commercial solvents, pesticides, commercial food preparation and
``architectural coatings'' such as paint.
   _ Extending pollution control standards to construction
equipment, pleasure boats and off-road vehicles.
   _ An ``Ultra Clean Motor Vehicle Program'' that would require
all new motor vehicles meet emissions limits 85 percent to 90
percent cleaner than those for vehicles now sold.

<HEAD>Scientists Get Federal Aid to Develop AIDS-Infection Drugs</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDs seven graqfs to identify the teams</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six teams of scientists will receive $2.8
million in federal funds to develop drugs that attack the
infections killing people with AIDS, government officials announced
Tuesday.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is
setting up a program that will provide a formal way for basic
research scientists to collaborate with drug companies to design
new drugs, they said.
   ``The urgency of the AIDS epidemic demands innovation,'' Anthony
Fauci, director of the institute, said in announcing the program.
   A version of this program is already being used to bring
together scientists of diverse backgrounds to work on drugs that
attack the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
Three drugs discovered through the program are now being tested in
clinical trials and others are in the pipeline, he said.
   AIDS activists have been strongly critical of federal scientific
research on AIDS because they say too much attention has been
focused on anti-viral drugs to attack HIV and not enough on drugs
to prevent and treat opportunistic infections.
   In its announcement of the new research, the institute said that
the research program for anti-virals ``did not preclude research on
opportunistic infections, but few applications for research in this
area were received.''
   As a result, the institute last year issued a request for
applications specifically addressing opportunistic infections, the
institute said.
   Opportunistic infections _ some rare, some ordinary _ often
attack AIDS patients whose immune systems have been weakened by the
disease, causing 90 percent of AIDS-related deaths.
   The most common infection is pneumosystis carinii pneumonia,
which occurs in about 85 percent of AIDS patients.
   Here are the lead researchers of each team and areas of research
interest:
   _Patrick J. Brennan, Colorado State University, Fort Collins;
the bacterium Mycobacterium avium.
   _Paul A. Lartey, Abbott Laboratories Corp., North Chicago, Ill.;
fungi-cell wall inhibitors.
   _Dr. Jack S. Remington, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Palo Alto,
Calif., Palo Alto, Calif.; toxoplasma organisms.
   _Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon, Washington University School of
Medicine, St. Louis; fungi-enzyme inhibitors.
   _James R. Piper, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Ala.;
Pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasma organisms.
   _Charles R. Sterling, Univesity of Arizona, Tucson;
Cryptosporidium bacteria.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Wednesday he expects a breakthrough toward ending
the 11-year-old Afghan civil war during his talks with U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``We will be able to help solve the Afghanistan question,''
Shevardnadze said minutes before meeting Baker in the first of
three scheduled one-on-one meetings over two days.
   Shevardnadze also said he and Baker would finalize plans for a
third summit between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. The summit is expected to take place in Moscow around
the end of this year or early 1991.
   Speculation that an agreement on Afghanistan, or a cease-fire,
might be near was fueled when Afghanistan's Soviet-backed President
Najibullah suddenly flew to Moscow on Sunday.
   Soviet officials initially said Najibullah had come to the
Soviet Union for health reasons.
   But Shevardnadze, speaking to reporters in front of the concrete
guest house in this eastern Siberian city, said Najibullah was ``on
vacation'' in the Soviet Union.
   On Tuesday, official Radio Kabul reported that Deputy Vice
President Abdul Rahim Hatif would temporarily act as president
while Najibullah is in the Soviet Union.
   When asked whether Najibullah would return to Afghanistsan,
Shevardnadze hesitated and then said, ``He will return to
Afghanistan just like any of us return home after vacation.''
   The United States backs the Pakistan-based Moslem guerrillas
fighting the Afghan government.
   Earlier, Shevardnadze said the positions of boths sides on
resolving the Afghan conflict were moving closer together and the
``issue of a settlement is now being posed differently.''
   The Baker-Shevardnadze meetings were also to cover the civil war
in Cambodia, U.S. economic aid to the Soviet Union, the Middle East
conflict and the divided Korean peninsula.
   Explaining the choice of Irkutsk as the venue for the talks,
Tass quoted Shevardnadze as saying such out-of-the-way locations
were convenient.
   ``Less time is wasted on protocol and there are time and the
conditions for a truly working atmosphere,'' said Shevardnadze, who
arrived in Irkutsk, 2,600 miles east of Moscow, late Tuesday.
   Shevardnadze said arrangements were to be made during his
meetings with Baker on the U.S.-Soviet summit, Tass said, quoting
remarks made on his flight to Irkutsk. Baker arrived for the talks
early Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze, in his in-flight interview, said Bush and
Gorbachev had agreed on the new meeting during their December
summit in Malta and that it should take place before the end of the
year, Tass said.
   This was why there was extremely little time left to prepare the
new summit, said Shevardnadze, as quoted by Tass.
   Gorbachev and Bush last met in June in Washington.
   In Washington, a White House official said a summit probably
will be held in Moscow next year but could come earlier if a
nuclear weapons treaty is ready for signing.
   ``I am not excluding or including'' the possibility of a Moscow
summit by the end of the year, said Alixe Glen, White House deputy
press secretary.
   Also on the flight, Shevardnadze hailed the recent meeting
between Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on German
unification as a ``breakthrough,'' Tass said. At that meeting,
Gorbachev agreed to NATO membership for a united Germany.
   Shevardnadze said the next round of formal unification talks
scheduled for September in Moscow would be the concluding one, Tass
reported. Those talks will involve the four World War II Allies,
plus leaders of the German states.
   Hope for resolving Cambodia's 12-year-old civil war remains
muted.
   Baker on Tuesday ended a five-day trip in Southeast Asia,
leaving Singapore without securing the support of the region's
foreign ministers for an abrupt about-face in U.S. policy toward
Cambodia.
   In mid-July, Baker announced the United States was ending eight
years of support for the Cambodian resistance and would begin
direct talks with Vietnam, which backs the Cambodian government.
Those talks are scheduled for Aug. 6 in New York.
   The goal was to distance the U.S. government from the Khmer
Rouge, the most powerful member of the resistance coalition. The
Khmer Rouge killed an estimated 1 million Cambodians during its
bloody 1975-78 rule.
   But the Cambodian question remains complicated because the
United States and the Soviet Union exercise limited influence in
the region.
   Najibullah's departure for Moscow sparked speculation that U.S.
and Soviet officials had reached a tacit agreement that the Afghan
president would hand over some power to a council of Afghan forces
prior to a nationwide election.
   The last time an Afghan president took a quick trip to Moscow
was in 1985. That president, Babrak Karmal, never returned to his
post and was replaced by Najibullah.
   U.S. negotiators have dropped their demand that Najibullah step
down. Now they say he could remain as president during the
election, providing he cedes control of the military, state media
and secret police to a neutral body.
   The Soviet Union is believed to have agreed to these terms and
the composition of the neutral body is now at issue.
   Since 1979, U.S.-backed rebels have battled first Soviet troops
and then Soviet-supported Afghan forces in a war that has left more
than 1.5 million people dead, including 13,000 Soviet troops, and
left millions more homeless.
   More than 115,000 Soviet soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan in
1989 after nine years of military intervention.
   After the talks in Irkutsk, Baker and Shevardnadze will take a
cruise on Lake Baikal. On Thursday, Baker is to fly to Mongolia for
talks with the government and a hunting trip.

<HEAD>Social Security Puts Temporary Hold On Travel For Appeals Hearings</HEAD>

   The Social Security Administration will
schedule no more hearings for disability benefit appeals in
September if they involve travel or other outside expenses, an
agency spokesman said Tuesday.
   The decision does not affect thousands of hearings already
scheduled nor does it mean that additional hearings cannot be
booked, said Philip Gambino, a Social Security spokesman.
   The hold on additional travel or outside expenses is temporary
and happens annually as the agency approaches the end of its fiscal
year in September, Gambino said.
   ``It's not unusual,'' Gambino said.
   He denied a report published in the Wednesday editions of the
New York Times, saying that the agency had ``suspended'' hearings
in September because of the year-end financial crunch.
   ``We haven't canceled any hearings,'' he said.
   ``We're still going to do hearings during September,'' Gambino
said. ``I can't even tell you if we're going to do less in
September than we are in August.''
   He estimated that the agency holds some 20,000 hearings a month
at more 200 locations around the country for people who are
appealing decisions that deny or reduce the Social Security
disability benefits they receive.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first woman police chief of a large
city said Tuesday that lack of money for legal fees has forced her
to abandon a sex-discrimination lawsuit against Mayor Bud Clark and
the city.
   Attorneys for Penny Harrington, who resigned as police chief in
1986, notified the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco that she had dropped her appeal of an earlier ruling on
the suit.
   A U.S. District Court jury on March 16 rejected Harrington's
claims that she was a victim of discrimination and was forced out
of office.
   ``I would like to have been able take it on to an appeal and
another court trial,'' Harrington said. ``But I exhausted all of my
resources. It was just too costly in money and emotionally.''
   Clark said he was pleased.
   ``I think she finally realized she was just wasting her time and
she may as well save her energy and get on with her life,'' the
mayor said.
   Harrington, who was the nation's first female chief of a large
police department, resigned in 1986 after a special commission
appointed by Clark recommended she be replaced. She served in the
post for 1{ years.
   She filed a lawsuit that sought unspecified damages for sex
discrimination, harm to her personal and professional reputation
and harm to her chances for future employment in police work. She
also sought damages for mental and emotional strain and
compensation for some of her legal fees.
   Harrington resigned after a commission appointed by Clark
questioned her ability to manage the department, which then had a
$47 million annual budget and 1,000 employees. The commission was
formed to investigate Harrington's alleged friendship with a
suspect in a drug case and her elimination of drug and vice units.
   A city pension board decided June 12 that Harrington was
entitled to increased benefits under a pension plan approved by
voters in November. Under the new plan, Harrington could receive an
annual pension of $36,679, plus cost-of-living increases.
   Portland City Attorney Jeff Rogers said it cost more than
$300,000 to defend the case. He said the city agreed it wouldn't
try to recover court costs from Harrington.
   ``This is the end of a chapter in my life and I'm glad that it
is over and I don't have to think about it any more,'' Harrington
said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where she works for
the California Bar Association. ``I have no hard feelings toward
Portland. I'm very happy in my job here. I am extremely
disappointed in Bud Clark.''

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British-trained Lt. Gen. Christon Tembo, a
former army commander being tried on charges of plotting to
overthrow the government, was freed Tuesday on orders of President
Kenneth Kaunda.
   Screaming supporters and jubilant relatives mobbed Tembo on the
steps of the High Court in Lusaka.
   He and three other senior army officers whose release was
announced by Kaunda on June 25 earlier appeared briefly in court to
hear Judge Weston Muzyamba discharge them.
   Muzyamba told Tembo, purported leader of the 1988 attempt; Lt.
Cols. Biswayo Nkunika and Chongo Shula; and Maj. Knight Mulenga
that they were discharged from detention, but not acquitted of
capital charges of treason.
   This meant that at any time the state can resume proceedings
against them.
   Tembo, arrested in late 1988, appeared in court wearing a
tailored gray suit. In court, he raised two fists in a victory
salute and told reporters he felt ``great.''
   Officials said Tembo and his three colleagues were taken to
Kaunda's official residence on their way to the court.
   Tembo refused to disclose what he discussed with Kaunda, telling
reporters the conversation was ``between me and the president.''
   After their discharge, the four officers were immediately driven
to the main prison in Lusaka to sign release papers.
   The case was widely seen as being politically damaging to Kaunda
and the party in power after state witnesses cited official
corruption as a major reason allegedly given by the defendants for
planning Kaunda's ouster.
   Kaunda was accused of holding a personal fortune of more than $4
billion in foreign bank accounts.
   Analysts said whether it was true or not, most Zambians believed
it.
   In June, during the worst civil unrest since Zambia's
independence from British colonial rule in 1964, many demonstrators
chanted ``Kaunda out! Tembo in!'' and similar slogans of support
for the general.
   At least 26 people died in five days of rioting and looting
touched off by food price increases and calls for the end of two
decades of one-party rule.
   On Monday, four people, including former High Court commissioner
Edward Shamwana, were freed by Kaunda as part of political reforms.
   The four were accused of plotting to overthrow the government in
1980.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Less Frequent Tests for Cervical Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cervical cancer tests done every three years
instead of every year are a lot less expensive, and the overall
accuracy is nearly the same, a researcher says, but others strongly
disagree.
   Previous studies show that tests every three years on women aged
20 to 65 are about 96 percent as effective at detecting cancerous
or other abnormal cells as annual exams, according to Dr. David M.
Eddy of Duke University.
   In addition, the three-year exams offer a two-thirds reduction
in cost, risk and inconvenience, according to Eddy's article in
Wednesday's edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.
   But women at high risk for cervical cancer _ including those who
smoke, use oral contraceptives or have multiple sex partners _ may
prefer exams every one to two years, said Eddy, who reviewed
studies on test frequency.
   Other researchers cautioned against following a recommendation
based on cost, and said physicians must consider human factors when
deciding how often to examine their patients for cervical cancer.
   ``The question is where to draw the line,'' Eddy said.
``Ideally, this should be decided by women themselves.''
   While some researchers believe that women tested every three
years will be more likely to forget the exam, any interval from one
to four years ``will deliver virtually the same benefits,''
according to Eddy.
   However, Dr. George Malkasian, the immediate past president of
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warned that
the death rate from cervical cancer would probably increase if
Eddy's recommendation were followed.
   Cervical cancer strikes more than 13,000 American women a year
and causes about 7,000 deaths annually. If the cancer is caught in
the early stages, the survival rate after five years is about 90
percent, aid Malkasian, a senior consultant at the Mayo Clinic,
said in a telephone interview.
   The most common test for cervical cancer is the Pap test, which
detects abnormal or cancerous cells in the cervix, the opening to
the womb. The test costs an average $76 per patient.
   Other cancer specialists argued that other factors should play a
role in a woman's decision regarding Pap tests. They point out that
the test is one of the main reasons the number of deaths from
cervical cancer has dropped 70 percent since it was first widely
used in the 1940s.
   Many medical organizations, including the obstetricians' and
gynecologists' college and the American Cancer Society, recommend
that women who are at least 18 years old or sexually active have
Pap tests annually for three years. After three negative tests,
women can reduce the frequency of the tests on their physicians'
advice, the groups suggest.
   Some cancer specialists, including Dr. Robert Young, president
of Philadelphia's Fox Chase Cancer Center, believe that as more
women rely on their gynecologist as their only provider of health
care, annual Pap tests can supply the only contact between patient
and physician.
   Despite Eddy's contention that only anecdotal evidence suggests
that physicians are more likely to discover other medical problems
in women who have annual Pap tests, ``there are certain realities''
that get lost in a cost analysis, Young said in a telephone
interview.
   He said he feared recommendations regarding Pap tests based only
on cost-effectiveness would discourage some women from being
examined at all. Of the 7,000 women who die each year of cervical
cancer, 85 percent never had a Pap test prior to the diagnosis,
according to Young.
   ``We need to encourage the wider use of Pap smears,'' he said.
   But the American College of Physicians, which publishes the
Annals, supports Eddy's recommendation of testing every three years.
   ``All women should be given information on the expected
benefits, risks and costs and be allowed to choose the screening
strategy that reflects their preferences,'' according to the
association.

<TEXT>
   In the city once notorious for the label ``banned
in Boston,'' a tour of Robert Mapplethorpe's controversial
photographs made its final stop Tuesday, opening to strong protests
and equally fervent support.
   One public television station showed seven sexually explicit
photographs from the so-called ``X Portfolio'' on its nightly
newscast.
   The exhibit has drawn the wrath of conservative Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C.; been canceled in Washington; inspired limits on
federal arts grants; and drawn criminal charges in Cincinnati.
   Largely because of the uproar, the show is expected to draw at
least 50,000 people in Boston. It runs through Oct. 4.
   A news conference in support of the show, coordinated by an
eclectic group calling itself the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression, included speeches by artists and playwrights. A march
and rally were planned for Wednesday, when the exhibit opens to the
public at the Institute of Contemporary Art.
   Hours after that news conference, a coalition of 13 groups
calling itself First Amendment Common Sense held a volatile
Statehouse news conference in which it pressed public officials to
halt the exhibit as obscene and unlawful.
   ``We're calling for a revival of common sense,'' said Evelyn
Dubel. ``To protest this bizarre and illegal behavior that
threatens the well-being of our citizens. We're concerned about the
well-being of our neighbors, especially our children.''
   Joe Reilley, a leader of Morality in Media, a group which says
it favors family values and opposes pornography, alluded to
upcoming legal action but refused to specify what that action would
be.
   One protester was arrested for interrupting the Common Sense
coalition news conference, which also featured heated questions
from members of gay rights groups.
   David Ross, director of the art institute, said he was proud to
have the exhibit and unafraid of the controversy surrounding the
show of 124 photographs taken by Mapplethorpe from 1969 until
shortly before he died of AIDS last year in Boston at the age of 42.
   ``What we have to fear is the suppression of these ideas,'' Ross
said, pointing to a button being sold in conjunction with the show
that said ``Fear No Art.''
   ``We're talking about art. This isn't the Combat Zone,'' Ross
said, referring to Boston's red light district. ``This is not a
pornography exhibit ... This show is a celebration of beauty.''
   Producers of WGBH-TV's ``Ten O'Clock News'' said they decided to
focus on the controversial photographs in their newscast rather
than concentrating on Mapplethorpe's portraits and flower studies.
   ``The coverage thus far never shows you this. All you get is
what is in the mind of the (newspaper) writer. And we want our
coverage to let the viewer decide, with both sides presented,''
said John VanScoyoc, the station's managing editor.
   Some of the most controversial photographs were shown, including
those depicting sadomasochism and homoeroticism. About 24 minutes
of the half-hour newscast was devoted to the exhibit and the
accompanying controversy.
   Alan Foster, news director at the station, said at least 63
calls were received on the station's response line within 15
minutes of the show's conclusion. The line was attached to an
answering machine and it would not be known until Wednesday how
callers felt about the broadcast, Foster said.
   Another 20 callers had managed to dial the station's newsroom
directly.
   ``Those have been universally positive,'' Foster said. ``One guy
said, `brilliant show, terrific journalism.'''
   Mary Catherine Kilday, enforcement chief of the Federal
Communications Commission in Washington, said the agency does not
monitor television or radio programming and ``we do not currently
have authority to enforce indecency complaints after 8 p.m.''
   A Mapplethorpe exhibit scheduled in June 1989 in Washington,
D.C., at the Corcoran Gallery of Art was canceled after Helms
branded the artist's work obscene. Helms' objections prompted
Congress to limit National Endowment for the Arts grants.
   Before those limits were imposed, organizers of the Mapplethorpe
tour received about $30,000 from the NEA _ about 10 percent of the
cost.
   Controversy was mild when the tour began in Philadelphia in late
1988 and it only drew about 12,000 visitors. But in Cincinnati this
spring, the exhibit spurred a rally and march by supporters and
opponents of the works.
   The Cincinnati exhibit led to an obscenity indictment against
the director of The Contemporary Arts Center, but a federal judge
barred police from confiscating photographs from the exhibit.
   Two of the disputed photographs in Cincinnati involved children.
In one, a boy's genitals are exposed; in the other, a girl's
genitals are exposed. Five others show homosexual acts.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Seeking to end a 4-day-old
hostage siege, Prime Minister Arthur N. R. Robinson says he has
agreed to resign, call elections in 90 days and grant his Moslem
extremist captors amnesty.
   He made the announcement along with a rebel spokesman late
Monday in a telephone call from inside the besieged Parliament
building. However, it was not clear when Robinson and the other 40
hostages might be freed.
   They were seized on Friday by members of a black Moslem group,
whose leader later claimed to have wired Robinson with explosives
that he said would be detonated if the government tried to rescued
the hostages.
   Robinson said Monday night that he was not coerced into the
agreement, which he announced in the call to a local journalist
several hours after military and government spokesmen said
negotiations had broken down.

   Baseball finally did to New York Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner what he'd been doing to managers for 18 years _
it fired him.
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday stripped
Steinbrenner of control of the team for allegedly paying a gambler
to dig up dirt on a ballplayer.
   ``For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be
treated as if he had been placed on the permanent ineligible
list,'' Vincent said. ``I hope this sad episode is now over.''
   Fans rose in a 90-second standing ovation when news spread to
Yankee Stadium. The decision brought shouts of ``No more George!''
   ``I will not comment on the decision,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm
very happy it was resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution,
and that's all I'm going to say.''

   This year's farm bill may take the worry out
of shopping for organic cucumbers.
   Other provisions apparently headed for adoption in Congress
would stop exports of pesticides banned domestically, expand
protection of wetlands and erodible fields and encourage farmers to
cut their use of chemicals that can find their way into the water
supply.
   The legislation, which sets agricultural policy for the next
five years, has at its heart a set of support programs for crops
and livestock.
   But this year's bill focused as never before on measures
intended to protect the Earth and its waters, drafted under the
watchful eye of lobbyists for environmental groups, farmers and the

conduct of the Exxon Valdez crew, the company that hired them and
the Coast Guard in determining what caused the nation's worst oil
spill.
   A report by the National Transportation Safety Board staff was
getting a final look at a public meeting today. The board then
planned to vote on the probable cause of the March 24, 1989, spill
of 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William

   The panel also was considering other possible conclusions
stemming from the disaster that led to a $1 billion cleanup effort

   A coroner who dropped a dead infant
head-first onto the floor as part of his research into skull
fractures is being sued by the child's parents for $2 million in a
case that has divided doctors over such practices.
   Some coroners say such research has been carried out in morgues
for years. Others say the permission of the next of kin should be
required.
   In the trial, which began last month, District Judge Hugh
Brunson must decide whether state law allows coroners to conduct
experiments not needed to determine the cause of death and whether
approval from relatives is needed.
   No state court has previously ruled on the issue. But state
Assistant Attorney General Chuck Yeager said in an opinion last
year that the law does not authorize such experiments without the
permission of the next of kin.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and his Soviet counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze will lay the
groundwork for a Soviet-U.S. summit, the Tass news agency said
Tuesday.
   Arrangements were to be made during two days of meetings in the
eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk, the official Soviet news agency
said quoting Shevardnadze, who spoke on the flight to Irkutsk.
Baker arrived for the talks early Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze, in his in-flight interview, said President Bush
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had agreed on the new
meeting during their December summit in Malta and that it should
take place before the end of the year, Tass said.
   This was why there was extremely little time left to prepare the
new summit, said Shevardnadze, as quoted by Tass.
   Gorbachev and Bush last met in June in Washington. A Soviet
foreign ministry source told Tass the next summit would be held in
the Soviet Union.
   In Washington, a White House official said a summit probably
will be held in Moscow next year but could come earlier if a
nuclear weapons treaty is ready for signing.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Shamrock,'' says the poster, ``isn't
the only thing that's green and comes from Ireland.''
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles do, too.
   Their fans may not realize it, but some of the Turtle cartoons
invading the world's TV screens are made by an often-tedious
process in Ireland, a country that makes up with humor and
motivation for its lack of any background in cartoon-making.
   The Irish may be unfamiliar with ``cowabunga,'' but they know a
job-creating export opportunity when they see one, which is why the
Industrial Development Authority of Ireland is willing to help pay
its way.
   Working from rough comic-strip storyboards drawn at Murakami
Wolf Swenson, the Burbank, Calif., owner of the animation rights,
dozens of artists and technicians hunch over drawing boards and
photography machines, producing 35mm films that will be sent back
to Burbank to be made into videocassettes.
   Housed in a functional office block in the center of the city,
Murakami Wolf Dublin Ltd. turns out a 22-minute cartoon every month
or so to feed the global appetite for ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles.''
   Each cartoon requires some 13,000 separate drawings, and the
work that falls to the junior animators is tedious. But for
Ireland, with its chronic double-digit unemployment, anything that
creates jobs is worth a try, and the Industrial Development
Authority sees the Turtles as Ireland's ticket to becoming ``a key
player in animation for television.''
   ``One of the advantages of Ireland is a well educated, young
population. It hasn't got a background in animation as such ... but
the people are very trainable,'' says Eamonn Lawless, the Dublin
account who manages the studio.
   ``As well as that, they're culturally compatible with the United
States and with Europe.''
   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' in case anyone hasn't heard,
are four terrapins who were dropped into a radioactive brew and
mutated into talking, pizza-scoffing teen-age wisecrackers. A rat
named Splinter trained them in the ancient Oriental art of Ninja
combat, and loosed them on America's streets to battle for justice.
   Americans may take such amiable nonsense in their stride, but
some Europeans have found it a trifle too manic. The British
Broadcasting Co. insists on the title ``Teenage Mutant HERO
Turtles,'' apparently believing that British audiences may have
difficulty with ``Ninja.''
   ``As far as they were concerned, it was too violent-sounding,''
said Lawless in an interview at his Spartan office desk.
   Lawless hadn't heard of the Turtles until he was approached two
years ago to head the Dublin operation. But he says he quickly
caught the bug.
   ``Irish generally are fairly nonconformist in their attitude,
and they're laidback to most things,'' he said. Besides, ``I'd not
regard myself as a stereotype accountant. I have always liked
cartoons.''
   The Dublin connection is a tribute to the Industrial Development
Authority's broadminded approach, and to Jimmy Murakami, an
accomplished American animator who has lived here for 17 years
dreaming of bringing the cartoon industry to Ireland.
   The IDA pays the studio a one-time grant of up to 9,000 pounds
($14,700) for each new job created _ half when the employee starts
work, and the rest if the job is still there six months later.
   The studio opened in February 1989, having promised to create
126 new jobs. It has, in fact, created 130, according to IDA
spokesman Michael Flood. It produced seven cartoons in 1989, and
will make 10 this year.
   It also illustrates the globalization of the entertainment
industry. Stories are created in California, animation is done in
Ireland and South Korea and the cartoons are shown worldwide.
   South Korea produces far more Turtle cartoons than Ireland, but
Murakami and Lawless believe the Irish have the advantage of
language and humor.
   ``They're easier to work with and they know what you're talking
about,'' says Chuck Swenson, a partner in the California studio who
has been here for eight months helping oversee the operation.
   Half the charm of the Turtles is their laidback, subversive
dialogue _ what Swenson calls ``that inane Californian slang.''
That makes it all the more important for animators to have a feel
for English and an acute sense of timing.
   For instance, Lawless cites a cartoon in which a Turtle has run
out of pizza money and turns to the camera saying: ``This means I'm
gonna have to (gulp) get a job!'' It takes a subtle hand to match
the gulp to the phrase.
   Also, adds Swenson, ``The idea of not being very excited over
getting a job doesn't really translate in Eastern Asian societies,
where everybody would love to have a job.''

   Seven summers have passed since Roy Radin's
corpse was found in a mountain grave, but the pudgy
cocaine-sniffing theatrical producer whose murder is an enduring
Hollywood mystery has not been forgotten.
   His sordid killing, a tale of drug world greed and a Hollywood
movie deal gone sour, is the subject of the new book: ``Bad
Company: Drugs, Hollywood and the Cotton Club Murder.''
   The book debuts on the eve of the ``Cotton Club'' murder trial,
and attorneys for the defendants are outraged at its timing.
   ``We're extremely concerned about our ability to get a jury
now,'' said attorney Marcia Morrissey who represents chief
defendant Karen Delayne ``Laynie'' Greenberger.
   She said the book's publication, plus its serialization in the
Los Angeles Times and Newsday, raises the likelihood that potential
jurors have been prejudiced against the defendants, and that
accounts of Greenberger's life are filled with inaccuracies.
   The author, Steve Wick, insisted the timing of the book's
release was coincidental. ``I don't think this book will keep them
from selecting a jury. ... I don't think I've convicted these
people before trial. ... As a journalist, I need to be fair to all
parties.''
   Wick, a reporter with New York Newsday, said he began probing
Radin's death after the producer's mother came to him in 1985
asking him to find out what happened to her son.
   Radin had left for Hollywood in the spring of 1983 to negotiate
a deal with movie tycoon Robert Evans to produce the movie ``The
Cotton Club.'' Radin disappeared in May and his bullet-riddled body
was found that June.
   ``I was fascinated that a man as savvy as Radin could come out
here for a business deal and be murdered,'' Wick said in an
interview.
   The larger significance of the ``Cotton Club'' case, said Wick,
is as ``a story of the greed-filled '80s'' and the impact of
cocaine in Hollywood.
   ``The public is fascinated by the case because they think it
says something about Hollywood. But for me the fascination is the
drug angle, the drug organizations,'' he said. ``I think Radin
would be alive today if he wasn't so wrecked on cocaine the last
week of his life.''
   Four people have been charged with Radin's murder and are set to
stand trial. A legal technicality delayed the scheduled start of
the trial on Monday.
   The star defendant is Greenberger, a former cocaine dealer once
romantically involved with Evans. She introduced Evans to Radin and
was a key player in negotiating the ``Cotton Club'' film.
   Prosecutors allege she arranged Radin's murder because she was
being cut out of the deal.
   Her co-defendants are three former bodyguards for Hustler
Magazine publisher Larry Flynt _ Alex Marti, William Mentzer and
Robert Ulmer Lowe. All have pleaded innocent.
   Wick said he tried to be particularly fair to Evans, the most
famous figure in the strange saga.
   ``I don't think he's a murderer,'' Wick said of the producer.
``But I think he used terribly bad judgment in getting involved
with these people. ... Some things that happened after the murder
raise some very troubling questions about Evans.''
   For instance, he questions why Greenberger telephoned Evans on
the night Radin was murdered. Phone records show the call, but Wick
said Evans claims to not remember what was said.
   He also notes that Evans told some investors Radin was murdered
before the producer's body was found.
   ``I don't know how Bob Evans knew Roy Radin was dead, but he
knew,'' said Wick.
   ``I had a number of conversations with him,'' Wick said of
Evans. ``He was such a troubled, wounded guy. ... He comes off as a
tragic guy, broken, used in many ways. He felt very much the victim
and in some ways he is.''
   Evans' lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said he had not read Wick's book
and could not comment on it.
   Evans declined to testify during a preliminary hearing in the
``Cotton Club'' case, invoking Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination.
   Wick said that although he is convinced Evans had no hand in the
murder, he wonders whether the moviemaker could have prevented it.
   ``I asked him: `Could you have saved this man's life?'' Wick
recalls. ``He said, `I didn't know he was in trouble.'''
   The key character in Wick's book is Greenberger, the last person
to be seen in Radin's company when he stepped into a limousine en
route to a Beverly Hills restaurant. He tracks her life from a poor
Southern upbringing to a powerful role in the cocaine-dealing
capital of Miami.
   ``What shaped her was Miami in the late '70s,'' he said. ``Her
life story is the story of a woman who coveted money and all it
could buy. She got trapped by the money and glamour. She was so
attracted to the glamour and lights and the Beverly Hills
lifestyle. After meeting Evans she thought it was all going to come
together and it was ruined by a big dope named Roy Radin.''
   But Morrissey said the details of Greenberger's life in Florida
are untrue and apparently not based on court records or sources.
   ``Much of the book is just made up,'' she said. ``It's what the
author imagined happened.''
   She said Greenberger is anxious to start her trial, believing
she will be vindicated.
   Wick acknowledged that the prosecution's case against
Greenberger presented at the preliminary hearing is far from open
and shut.
   ``There is a good chance this woman could prevail at a trial,''
he said. ``I don't want to mess up her case. ... I wish her well. I
think it's going to be a very tough case.''

   Peter Orsino's eyes flash with anger when
anyone tells him the death of his 8-year-old son was an act of God.
   Peter Orsino Jr. was eating in the cafeteria of the East
Coldenham Elementary School last Nov. 16 when a 90-mph wind
demolished a 12-foot cafeteria wall, later shown to be of defective
design. Peter and eight other children died in a shower of concrete
and glass.
   ``It wasn't an act of God,'' the boy's father said, ``because
God doesn't make buildings.''
   Orsino and several other bereaved parents have channeled their
grief and anger into a tenacious effort to get the state to change
laws regarding inspections of school buildings. But a top school
official said these efforts, and lawsuits filed in the wake of the
disaster, have caused bitterness.
   Eight months after the storm clouds lifted, this close-knit
rural hamlet 50 miles north of New York City is divided between
those who want to forget the tragedy and those who can't.
   Pictures from that day remain etched in memory: tearful parents
rushing up to the school to see if their children were alive or
dead.
   Sympathy poured in from across the country, and Gov. Mario Cuomo
attended a memorial service for the nine dead children three days
after the disaster.
   When the initial shock wore off, parents from seven of the nine
families started to meet regularly at the town firehouse. It was a
way to talk through their grief, said John Lichtler, whose
7-year-old daughter, Joanna, was killed.
   That grief turned to anger when a state report on the disaster
concluded that the cafeteria wall, built with the rest of the
school in 1959, was not capable of withstanding hurricane-force
winds.
   ``Accidents happen every day, people are hurt and killed,'' said
Frances Soltis, who lost her 7-year-old son, Adam. ``But our
children were not out in the street running in front of cars and
they weren't playing with matches. They were eating their lunch in
a school cafeteria. They were in a place where they were supposed
to be safe.''
   In March, the parents of seven East Coldenham victims signed a
letter to Cuomo, urging legislative action on school building
safety.
   The parents want architects and engineers sent to every school
in the state at regular intervals to detect possible dangers. They
want blueprints checked to see if others have design flaws similar
to East Coldenham's. Defects were discovered at four other New York
schools after the disaster.
   The parents' anger, their continued outspokenness, has not been
well-received by some of their neighbors.
   Bruce Armbrister, who lost his 7-year-old stepson, said he had
to restrain himself from attacking one man who told him, ``What are
you fighting for? You're going to be a millionaire.''
   Armbrister and 32 others _ parents of the 24 children who were
injured or killed, along with others who say their children were
traumatized _ have filed negligence lawsuits against the state,
Orange County and the school district.
   The lawsuits have caused resentment among unaffected parents who
wonder what the claims could do to tax bills, said James Coonan,
superintendent of the Valley Central School District.
   School officials are stuck between two emotional camps, Coonan
said.
   An incident about three weeks after the disaster typified some
of the problems.
   While driving one of her three surviving children to East
Coldenham to school, Soltis saw the building's American flag flying
at full-staff for the first time since the storm. It was like a
``dagger through my heart,'' she said.
   She lowered the flag to half-staff in the late autumn chill.
   The next day, she found the flag at full-staff again. Again, she
lowered it.
   ``They reach a point where they don't want to confront it
anymore,'' Soltis said. ``I see it in the (other) families. They
got through with minimal damage to their family. They survived, so
there's a tendency to block it.
   ``I don't expect people to feel what I feel,'' she said. ``But I
expect them to respect my son's memory and to respect my family's
grief.''
   Coonan said no disrespect was intended to storm victims. School
officials agreed to keep the flag flying at half-staff for the rest
of the school year _ drawing phone calls from other parents who
complained it was an unpleasant reminder for their children, he
said.
   The flag will be flying at full-staff again when school opens in
September.
   ``You get trouble when you go from sad to mad,'' Coonan said.
``There's a lot of anger when people lose children, and that anger
is kind of out there looking for some place to land and it lands on
different people at different times. It's not always pleasant when
it happens, but people tell us it's normal.''
   Lichtler leads the effort to change state school inspection
laws. A computer programmer at the U.S. Military Academy, he has
compiled a bulging file of newspaper stories about shoddy school
construction.
   The chairman of the Education Committee in the New York state
Assembly, Angelo Del Toro, is backing the parents with a bill that
would require schools to be inspected once every three years.
   New York's Legislature did not act on the proposal before
recessing for the summer earlier this year, partly because of a
last-minute proposal from Cuomo. The governor, concerned about the
cost of mandatory inspections, suggested training local school
officials to make the inspections themselves.
   Although the Valley Central schools all have been inspected,
some school districts are concerned about the expense of hiring
experts for regular inspections, said Richard Jansen, until
recently the school board president.
   ``Our children should be safe, but there has to be a real
rational way of doing it,'' Jansen said. ``I could see some
problems down the road when the expenses would just get bigger and
bigger.''
   To the bereaved, no price is too high.
   Soltis said her three children will go to private school this
fall, and Armbrister said he isn't sure if East Coldenham is safe
enough to send his daughter to kindergarten there next year.
   ``We have to feel that our children's lives amounted to
something,'' Lichtler said. ``If we can save one child, then their
lives would have been at least been extended for a purpose.''

<HEAD>John Henry Faulk: `The Man Who Beat the Blacklist'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somewhere it is written that heroism is being
brave when there's nobody watching.
   ``The Man Who Beat the Blacklist: John Henry Faulk'' on PBS
tonight is about such a man, unjustly shunned and disgraced, who
stood up to his oppressors at a time when fundamental American
values were unfashionable.
   And he beat them.
   Faulk's story, in interviews with Bill Moyers and narration by
Studs Terkel, is an American tragedy that began in one of our
nation's nastier eras, the era of the blacklist, Red scares and
loyalty oaths.
   AWARE Inc., a self-appointed public guardian would _ for a fee _
tell broadcasters if certain performers were communist
sympathizers. If a broadcaster balked, AWARE Inc. would pressure
sponsors and ad agencies.
   Such was the tenor of the times. It was said that Ed Sullivan
would not allow performers on his show that AWARE Inc. had not
cleared.
   Faulk, host of CBS Radio's popular afternoon show, ``Johnny's
Front Porch,'' won office in 1955 with members of the performers'
union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, who
pledged to end AWARE's influence.
   In 1956, AWARE falsely accused him of being a ``known communist
sympathizer.'' His show's sponsors and stations started getting
calls about Faulk's alleged involvement with commie front
organizations.
   AWARE accused him of attending a meeting at which a ``known
Communist'' was present. True, Faulk acknowledged: It was the first
anniversary dinner of the United Nations and the Communist was
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.
   His sponsors began deserting the show. By coincidence, his
ratings dropped and CBS fired him in the summer of 1957. He was
succeeded by Arthur Godfrey and was never to work in network
broadcasting again.
   Unemployed and unemployable, Faulk did the unthinkable: He filed
a libel lawsuit against AWARE Inc. and its officers, seeking $1.5
million in damages.
   Faulk was broke and living on loans from friends, but he
retained the great attorney Louis Nizer. The great newsman Edward
R. Murrow, by then a CBS board member, gave him $7,500 to help pay
Nizer's retainer.
   ``I am not making a personal loan to you of this money,'' Murrow
said. ``I am investing in America.''
   For five years, AWARE delayed the trial. Faulk moved back to his
native Texas, started an advertising agency and eked out a living.
Finally, in 1962, the case was played out in an 11-week trial.
   The jury awarded him a then-record $3.5 million.
   ``One lone man with virtually no resources,'' Nizer later wrote,
``dragged the defendants into court and although outrageously
outnumbered, withstood starvation and disgrace and summoned up
enough strength to battle them into submission.''
   The jury's award marked an end to the blacklist and the demise
of AWARE Inc., but the damage to Faulk's career was complete. He
still couldn't get a job.
   The record award was reduced by an appeals court to $725,000. Of
that, the moribund AWARE Inc. eventually paid $175,000, but it went
to Faulk's creditors.
   He stayed in Texas and achieved prominence in the South as an
after-dinner speaker and a passionate advocate for the First
Amendment. He also mounted a one-man show ``Pear Orchard, Texas,''
in which he portrayed a number of the mythical town's inhabitants.
   Faulk died of cancer on April 9, 1990.
   In the interviews with Moyers, which took place in the last year
of his life, he was cheerful, merry and passionate about his life
and his battle.
   The final irony of ``The Man Who Beat the Blacklist'' is that
Faulk didn't really beat it; he fought the blacklist to a draw. He
did it alone, and asked no quarter from the scoundrels who
oppressed him.

If the preceding sentence means anything to you, you probably will
be watching Saturday night's episode of ``Beauty and the Beast,''
CBS' offbeat, moody, romance-action-drama series.
   It's the last original episode of a series that attracted the
biggest, most powerful and vocal fan following since ``Star Trek,''
but which never really caught on with most of the TV audience.
   ``Beasties,'' as some fans call themselves, put such
considerable pressure on the network after the series was canceled
that it is bound to play on in syndication.

   Yvette Hernandez never votes _ not for mayor of
New York, not for Congress, not even for president. But if Puerto
Rico's future comes to a vote, she's ready to head for the nearest
polling place.
   ``Why shouldn't I vote? I'm Puerto Rican,'' she declares.
   That this furniture saleswoman has lived in New York for 17
years matters little. She was born in Puerto Rico, and if the
island is to decide its future _independence, statehood, or no
change _ she wants a say.
   She is not alone. Even as Congress debates when and if to hold a
plebiscite, a parallel debate is going on in and out of the
mainland Puerto Rican community: Should Puerto Ricans who left the
island _ and even the descendants of those emigrants _ have a vote
in its destiny?
   ``We think of ourselves as one nation and Puerto Rico is never
out of mind for us. And that's a fact,'' explains U.S. Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-Bronx.
   Serrano, himself Puerto Rican born, has proposed an amendment to
the plebiscite legislation that would extend the vote to anyone
born in Puerto Rico or with at least one parent born on the island.
   The proposal is unprecedented, according to Columbia University
law professor Henry P. Monaghan.
   ``There is no case in which there have been people who are not
living in a territory who are enfranchised,'' he said.
   The idea of 2.5 million people on the mainland taking part in
the plebiscite doesn't sit well with everyone, especially Sergio
Pena Clos, a member of the island's Senate.
   ``They've left the island. They've abandoned the island and now
they want to vote?'' said Pena Clos. ``They'll be affecting my
destiny, the island's destiny and the destiny of my descendants.''
   Serrano's reply: ``This is not an election for public office.
This is an election on status _ political status _ and that
decision belongs to all the Puerto Rican people.''
   Serrano's words echo on the streets of East Harlem, home to many
of New York's 1 million Puerto Ricans.
   ``This is something that is a big decision. This is not like an
election that takes place every four years,'' said Carlos de Jesus,
the New York-born son of a woman from Puerto Rico. ``Because,
depending on the outcome of that vote, many people here might just
want to go back to Puerto Rico.''
   His wife, Carmen, also born in New York, wants to vote.
   ``No matter where in the world they are now, they should be
allowed to vote. It's our right and no one has the right to take
that away,'' she said.
   Puerto Rico, in fact, has not been independent since it was
conquered by Ponce de Leon for Spain in 1509. The island remained a
Spanish colony until the Spanish-American War of 1898, when became
a U.S. territory.
   Puerto Rico became a U.S. commonwealth in 1952, exposing its
people to a dizzying array of contradictory rights and
proscriptions.
   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and are eligible for military
service, but cannot vote for president. They elect their own
governor and Legislature, but their representative to Congress has
no vote there. Federal law applies to the island, but Puerto Ricans
pay no federal taxes.
   In a 1967 non-binding referendum, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans
said they wanted to retain commonwealth status while 39 percent
wanted statehood. But recent polls indicate that a slim majority
favors statehood.
   It is not clear that they will have an opportunity to vote in
the near future. President Bush, who strongly backs statehood for
Puerto Rico, has urged Congress to pass plebiscite legislation
mandating that whatever is decided by the voters be implemented by
1993.
   In a letter to the House subcommittee considering the bill, Bush
wrote: ``How can we applaud the exciting and momentous movements
toward freedom in Eastern Europe, Latin America and elsewhere while
refusing to grant to our own citizens the right to
self-determination?''
   But the chances of passing such a bill in 1990 appear slim.
Action on the House version has been delayed by the illness of Del.
Ron de Lugo, D-V.I., chairman of the Interior subcommittee on
insular and international affairs.
   The bill's Senate counterpart, which has been approved by the
Energy and Commerce Committee, still must be considered by the
Finance, Agriculture and Judiciary committees before it can go to
the full body. And, because it's an election year, Congress is
hoping to adjourn earlier than usual.
   Still, the debate about who would vote continues, off the island
and on.
   Rafael Hernandez Colon, Puerto Rico's governor and leader of the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, has said he favors
allowing first-generation Puerto Ricans living in the United States
to vote in the plebiscite but believes most island residents oppose
the idea.
   And former Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo, of the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party, said any effort to determine who would be
eligible to vote would be a ``logistical nightmare.''
   Pena Clos noted that Puerto Rico has about 3.5 million people,
about 2.1 million of whom eligible to vote.
   ``How can 2.5 million people living in the United States be
allowed to affect the future of those on the island?'' he asked.
   Miguel Colom, who moved to New York 12 years ago, agrees that he
and others living here have no business voting on the island's
future.
   ``I'm an American. That's it,'' he said.
   ``Why should they vote if they live here? They're not affected
by what happens there. I know a lot of people who say, `I'm Puerto
Rican,' but if they sit down and think about it, they'll realize
they were born here, live here and work here. Why should they vote
there?''
   Gilberto Seda was born in New York. ``It's not that I don't care
about Puerto Rico; I do,'' he said. ``And it's not that I deny I'm
Puerto Rican. But my homeland is New York.''
   But Serrano said such thinking is too narrow. ``If this were the
United Nations, this would be easy to understand _ that there is a
nation of Puerto Ricans just as there is a nation of Jews around
the world and a nation of Palestinians,'' he insisted.
   Which is the same reasoning that Puerto-Rican born Yvette
Hernandez _ the non-voter _ uses in asserting her right to vote in
a plebiscite.
   ``I live here, but I'm Puerto Rican. So I should vote,'' she
said.

   It would take Broadcast Music Inc. 28 years
and six months to relive all its yesterdays.
   Or ``Yesterday,'' to be precise. The Beatles classic that Paul
McCartney once called ``Scrambled Eggs'' until he thought of a
better title is the most-broadcast tune in the song publishing
company's vast catalog. It's gone past the 5 million mark.
   Played back to back, that would amount to more than 28 years
worth of ``Yesterday,'' said Frances Preston, BMI president and
chief executive officer.
   Preston knows this arcane piece of musical trivia because that's
what her company does.
   Through computersheets, BMI keeps track of how
many times songs are played in order to funnel royalty checks to
its stable of more than 60,000  and radio log ssongwriters. The company
is
celebrating the 50th anniversary of its birth with a series of
public events this year.
   ``It's not celebrating BMI, it's celebrating the creativity of
the great songwriters and publishers who have built this catalog,''
Preston said.
   With the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,
BMI is involved in a high-stakes competition that's invisible to
most music fans but very important to those who make money off
music. BMI against
the music business establishment and has now become the
establishment, said author Marc Eliot, who wrote about the
company's birth in his book, ``Rockonomics: The Money Behind the
Music.''
   The companies work by signing a royalties contract with
songwriters, occasionally getting into a bidding war for big-name
artists. Musicians are assured a source of income at a time when
they may be struggling to make it in the business, or after their
time has passed.
   The companies check how many times a song is performed on radio,
television or elsewhere and collect license fees that are
distributed to songwriters. In the case of ``Yesterday,'' it means
estimating airtimes through logs kept by radio stations on what
songs they play.
   It's not just the Beatles' version of the tune that's counted,
but renditions recorded by Ray Charles, Placido Domingo, Elvis
Presley, Merle Haggard, Lawrence Welk, the Supremes, Frank Sinatra
and about 100 others.
   And it's not just on radio stations, but every time the song is
performed at trade shows, in shopping malls, on elevators and even
on airplanes, Preston said.
   Back when BMI was formed in 1939, ASCAP had a virtual monopoly
on song publishing. Broadcasters angered with the royalty rates
demanded by ASCAP and the limited number of licensed composers they
could play on the air started the company, Eliot described in his
book.
   The new company had an open-door policy for all sorts of
musicians that were essentially ignored by ASCAP, including country
music, rhythm and blues and, eventually, rock 'n' roll, Preston
said.
   ``They just became a house organ, a scab union in order to gain
representation for what ASCAP considered the garbage of the pile,''
Eliot said. ``It turned out to be the cream of the crop.''
   BMI signed artists who weren't part of the traditional Tin Pan
Alley, such as Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams in the
early years. When rock 'n' roll started, it gave BMI access to a
goldmine of hits from Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, B.B. King,
the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
   By the late 1950s, BMI was jokingly referred to in the industry
as Big Money Incorporated, Eliot said in ``Rockonomics.''
   Today, the two companies compete on almost an even keel, Eliot
said. BMI, because it's still more willing to take a chance on
unknown artists, still has an advantage in rock and pop music,
while ASCAP has the lead in such areas as Broadway and television,
he said.
   ``They've become more conservative, they've become less
embattled,'' he said of the two companies. ``They realize there's
room at the table for both plates. It's better to exist without a
cold war.''
   Preston said the constant advance of new technology keeps BMI
royalty hunters busy. For instance, the use of music as a
motivational tool at trade shows and corporate meetings is a
lucrative part of the business that was hardly thought of a decade
ago.
   The increased use of ``sampling'' old riffs in new songs,
particularly by rap artists, presents a fascinating new challenge
for the publishing companies, Eliot said.
   In some cases, older artists whose work is being appropriated
don't appreciate what the new musicians have done, he said.
   It's still an open question that may have to be decided by
courts. Former members of the '60s rock band the Turtles were
furious with rappers De La Soul for using part of their music
without permission. MC Hammer recently cut Rick James in on part of
the royalties for ``U Can't Touch This,'' which borrows the melody
from James' hit, ``Superfreak.''
   BMI has planned several events to celebrate its anniversary,
including giving a special achievement award to Michael Jackson.
But one anniversary commemoration may make music fans envious.
   The company has produced a three-CD set of some of its best
music, including the pop charts and television themes. It's
virtually an encyclopedic look at what's been popular for the last
50 years, from the Tommy Dorsey band's ``Opus No. 1'' to the Miami
Sound Machine's ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You.''
   Don't look for it in stores, however _ the company is just
distributing it to people in the industry, politicians and the
media.
   ``I've had so many calls from people asking if they could buy it
somewhere,'' she said. ``But it's not for sale.''

   Bong Jae Jang rises before dawn and goes to the
Brooklyn Terminal Market, where he stocks up on green plantain,
Haitian mangos and other fruits and vegetables popular with the
Caribbean immigrants who used to shop at his store on Church Avenue
in Flatbush.
   These days, Jang's trip is an academic exercise; he knows most
of the produce will sit unsold on the shelf, rot in the July heat
and wind up in the trash bin outside.
   ``Who's going to buy this?'' he asks, holding up a
cellophane-wrapped hunk of a vegetable called pium kim that is
besieged by a swarm of tiny flies.
   After six months, a black-led boycott of Jang's greengrocery
continues, even though the television cameras are gone and the
pickets who gather outside the front door each afternoon have
dwindled to a handful.
   The boycotters' avowed aim is to force the store to close.
   Jang's troubles began Jan. 18, when Giselaine Felissaint, a
Haitian immigrant, got into an argument with several of his
employees over some merchandise. One of them touched her. She says
the man knocked her down; another employee says the man put his
hands on her and she laid down.
   Five months passed before the store's manager, Pong Ok Jang, was
charged with assault, but the incident immediately became a symbol
of the tensions between the city's black and Korean communities.
   Within a few months, hundreds of demonstrators were gathering
outside the store each day, along with almost as many police and
journalists. Pickets yelled racial slurs at the Koreans and urged
them to ``go back to where you came from.''
   Tensions were heightened by the trial of some white youths
accused of killing a black youth in the Bensonhurst section. In a
special televised speech to the city, Mayor David Dinkins pleaded
for calm and understanding.
   The problem runs far beyond a simple assault charge. Many blacks
resent the way they are treated in some of the Korean grocery
stores that have opened in their communities, and some are jealous
of the immigrants' business success. The self-employed account for
6.7 percent of all city workers, but only 3.4 percent of all black
workers.
   Skeptics derided the boycott as a news media creation that would
end as soon as the last camera crew departed. They were wrong. By 5
p.m., there usually are about a dozen demonstrators behind the blue
police barricades that line the sidewalk outside the store. Few
neighborhood residents defy their cries of ``Boycott!'' and venture
inside or visit another Korean grocery across the street.
   ``The stores have become a symbol of what has happened across
this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black
people,'' says George Dames, a spokesman for the Flatbush Coalition
for Economic Empowerment, a boycott group. ``It was not an isolated
incident.''
   Since May, however, ``tensions there have been lessening, if not
dramatically, then incrementally,'' says Lonnie Soury, spokesman
for the city's Human Rights Commission.
   The Rev. Roy Thompson of St. Paul's Episcopal Church agrees: ``I
can drive by the store without getting stuck in traffic for a
half-hour.''
   Dinkins has appointed a fact-finding panel and called for an end
to the boycott, but none seems likely soon. There still have been
no direct negotiations between the Korean and Haitian communities,
let alone Jang and Mrs. Felissaint. She has refused to denounce the
boycott and has filed a $6 million suit against the store.
   ``People say, `End it,' but we can't just wave a magic wand,''
says Soury of the human rights commission, which is trying to get
talks started.
   ``We're trying to identify leaders who represent those with
legitimate interests. There are people who don't have an interest
in settling the issue,'' he says. ``We think that if we can get a
group of people who can meet, we can make progress. But they're not
meeting now.''
   According to a poll taken last month, only 13 percent of New
Yorkers supported the boycott, while 58 percent supported the
Koreans. Among blacks, only 27 percent sympathized with the
boycotters, while 37 percent sided with the Koreans. Boycott
leaders say the results simply reflected biased news coverage.
   Jang, 35, says he came here in 1983 and worked for five years at
another store before opening his own. Before the boycott, he says,
he routinely worked 17 hours a day, and was robbed three times. He
shows off the scar where a robber's bullet entered his abdomen last
year.
   His business is being sustained largely by $5,000 to $7,000 a
month in donations from the city's other Korean grocers. ``They
will support him until the boycott is over,'' says Michael Kang of
the Korean Produce Association. ``He is their Maginot Line. They
think they're going to be next.''
   Jang is infuriated by the refusal of the police department to
enforce a judge's order that the protesters be kept 50 feet from
his door. The city has appealed, arguing that the police should be
allowed to use discretion in deciding where the protesters should
stand.
   Jang says neither Dinkins nor Police Commissioner Lee Brown
wants to stand up to the boycotters, and pass responsibility for
dealing with them back and forth. He does not speak English very
clearly, but he gets his point across: ``They play a ping-pong
game. They killing my dream.''
   To Soury, the boycott is a tragedy. ``Two immigrant groups are
pitted against each other,'' he says, ``when they should be
fighting together to demand more government aid for small
businesses _ for blacks and Koreans and everyone else.''

   Steven Kutcher has had a bug-eyed fascination
with creepy, crawly critters ever since he captured his first
firefly when he was 4.
   Since then, he has mixed his serious study of bugs with
Hollywood make-believe, cashing in on science to become a
behind-the-scenes star in fright movies such as the spidery
``Arachnophobia.''
   ``I use Hollywood to educate. I've learned to work both sides of
the track,'' said Kutcher, 43, whose thinning hair, wispy beard and
slight features give him the look of a student of bugs.
   ``I know there will be people who can't sleep at night and there
will be more calls to exterminators because of this movie,''
Kutcher said in a recent interview. ``But I don't want to frighten
people with spiders. My hope is that people will be more educated
about spiders than they were before.''
   In the real world, Kutcher is an entomologist. In the
entertainment world, he is a bug wrangler and Hollywood's best
known insect expert. His ultimate goal is to lecture school kids
and write books about bug behavior. But he allowed: ``You don't get
the money you do when you frighten the wits out of people.''
   Oh, yeah, fright. The bite in ``Arachnophobia'' comes from the
audience's paralyzing fear of spiders. The jitters are noted from
nursery rhymes such as ``Little Miss Muffet,'' to government
studies.
   The top phobia among females and the second scariest thing next
to heights for males is the fear of spiders, bugs, mice and snakes,
according to a 1988 study by the National Institute of Mental
Health.
   And just watch how fast people move if they walk into a silky
spider web in the dark.
   Hollywood hyped the anxiety by giving unreal powers to spiders
in ``Arachnophobia,'' such as a poisonous bite that kills in
seconds. The eight-legged creatures that did all the killing are
harmless delena spiders from New Zealand, and Kutcher had one crawl
on his face to show how benign it is.
   The long-legged delena, which fits in the palm of the hand, was
one of 12 species considered for the part. It was cast because of
its ability to run, jump, walk upside down and spin a web.
   But Tinseltown for years has taken liberties to scare the
bejabbers out of audiences with sharks, killer bees, rats, snakes,
scorpions, frogs, ants, crocodiles and even killer rabbits.
   ``With `Jaws,' if you stay out of the water, you are safe.
Humans and spiders live in the same world. They can be underneath
your seat,'' Kutcher said.
   ``A spider projects an image of being very dangerous,'' he said.
``But is something that small going to eat you? If you educate
yourself, you can overcome this fear. People should learn which
spiders are dangerous.''
   Spiders have their good points. They eat roaches and other
housebold bugs.
   They are relatively safe, even the doubled-fanged, gargantuan
tarantulas that were used in ``Arachnophobia.'' The zebra-striped
tarantulas are as large as an extended hand. They can barely be
felt when their hairy legs crawl on your skin, and they throw off
little hairs that feel like fiberglass.
   The important thing is to be gentle, Kutcher said.
   ``If you pick a puppy up by the tail or a kitten by the
whiskers, it's going to bite or scratch you. If you pick up a
spider by its leg, it will try to defend itself. I try to be very
delicate,'' Kutcher said.
   During an interview Kutcher wore a T-shirt adorned with the
image of a tarantula, a wristwatch that had a spider circling a web
to mark time and a baseball cap that said ``Bugs Are My Business.''
   He once had a radio show that had a Bug Boss 40, featuring such
songs as ``Bo Weevil'' and ``Elusive Butterfly of Love.''
   For a wedding in California, he released 1,000 butterflies as
part of the nuptials.
   And his bedroom skylight features a real spider web. The
downside is that the bodies of trapped flies sometimes fall on his
pillow.
   Kutcher has been making movies with bugs for 14 years. He
directed 6,000 beetles in ``Prince of Darkness,'' placed 3,000
grasshoppers on the faces of Richard Burton and Linda Blair in
``The Exorcist II: The Heretic'' and put a disarmed wasp on Farah
Fawcett's thigh in ``Extremities.''
   He even gets into the act himself. Last year he sat in a bathtub
with 100,000 meal worms for David Letterman.
   And he is a veteran with spiders. Among his TV credits is the
movie ``Tarantula _ The Deadly Cargo.''
   How does one train a spider? Very carefully, said Kutcher.
   ``Anyone can take a bucket of cockroaches and dump it on the
table. My job is to direct them. I use their behavior and adapt it
to what the film director wants,'' Kutcher said.
   Actually, spiders can't be trained in the traditional sense like
dogs, cats, bears or dolphins. They don't sit up and beg or jump
through hoops for food or rewards. But there are tricks to control
the eight-legged extras.
   In ``Arachnophobia,'' invisible vibrating wires set up
boundaries that the spiders wouldn't cross. Moviemakers also
corralled spiders with the spray wax Lemon Pledge, which the
hairy-legged spiders wouldn't walk in.
   Heat made the spiders active. And blow dryers coaxed them to
walk.
   Kutcher travels with a cache of six tarantulas. That means he
also carries a bag of crickets to feed them.
   He spins stories of real-life spiders that can throw their webs
like a fisherman throws a net. And he tells of spiders that look
like ants or bird droppings.
   ``What a life,'' Kutcher said, marveling at his career. ``Look
at all the things that have happened to me because I like spiders.
   ``People say, `Yuck, he plays with bugs.' But I get to work with
damsels in distress. I never knew when I was in school I'd be
coaxing a tarantula to crawl up a woman's leg for Hollywood.''

<DATELINE>CUSTER BATTLEFIELD NATIONAL MONUMENT, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Battle of
the Little Bighorn has resumed 114 years after Lt. Col. George
Armstrong Custer made his last stand and Indians won their last
major victory of the Plains wars.
   This time, Barbara Booher is under attack.
   Booher, female and Indian, is the National Park Service's
superintendent at the most famous battlefield in the American West,
the place where Custer lost to Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse but
became a legend of machismo and bravery.
   Her appointment has triggered letters of protest to Washington
from Custer fans who claim she is unfit for the job.
   Supporters counter that her tenure already has meant more jobs
at the battlefield for qualified Indians, and will result in a much
more balanced view of the controversial battle.
   ``I think Barbara was selected for all the wrong reasons,
because she is a woman and an Indian,'' said Bill Wells, of Malibu,
Calif., who serves on the board of both the non-profit Custer
Battlefield Historical and Museum Association and the Little Big
Horn Associates, a group dedicated to preserving Custer's memory.
   ``I don't think she was qualified, and she was ill-prepared. I
think she is way in over her head,'' Wells said.
   But Ms. Booher's arrival is hailed as a miracle by local Indian
leaders, long angry at what they believe is a slanted emphasis at
the park toward Custer and the 7th Cavalry at the expense of proper
recognition for the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors who won the battle.
   ``It's been a coming of age for a monument that has been in the
dark ages,'' said Janine Pease-Windy Boy, president of nearby
Little Big Horn College at Crow Agency, Mont.
   ``Barbara's a breath of fresh air. Superintendents prior to her
were consistently more interested in military history from the
Custer point of view. There's nothing more symbolic than an Indian
and a woman to upset these so-called historians who are mostly
white and male,'' she said.
   The debate over Ms. Booher's appointment began even before she
arrived here in June 1989. She had never worked for the park
service before she was named superintendent. For the past 17 years,
she worked for the federal government in Alaska, first with the
Federal Aviation Administration, then as the allotment coordinator
with the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Anchorage.
   But in March 1989, as an executive management trainee assigned
to park service regional director Lorraine Mintzmyer in the Rocky
Mountain region, she so impressed her mentor that Ms. Mintzmyer,
the highest ranking woman in the park service, offered Ms. Booher
the job at Custer.
   ``I recognized that her native American heritage might be a plus
for her in an area where many native Americans live and work, but I
hired her because of the skills she demonstrated, not because of
her heritage,'' said Ms. Mintzmyer.
   ``I have been very pleased with her work at Custer, despite the
fact there have been a few critics,'' she said. ``But I wouldn't
have become the first woman superintendent if someone hadn't
decided to ignore the critics and give me a chance.''
   Born and raised on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in
Utah, Ms. Booher's father was of Cherokee descent and her mother is
northern Ute. She is a soft-spoken woman who suffers from glaucoma
in both eyes, although she is a pilot and owns two airplanes back
in Alaska.
   ``I was very proud to be selected, and I'm still proud, but I
had no idea it would be like this, with such high visibility,''
said Ms. Booher, 49. ``I suppose I was a little naive. I was told
it was a tough assignment, and now I know what that means. This is
not a job, it's a way of life.
   ``There is nothing neutral about the Custer battlefield. People
say it is an enigma, that there's an aura that draws people. This
story is known all over the world. All I'd ever heard about it in
school was from the Custer point of view, and when I came here on
my own as a tourist in 1973 I thought, `Well, that's all cavalry.'
This is the only place where all the monuments are to the losers.''
   In her first year, Ms. Booher has doubled the hiring of Indians
at the monument and tangled with critics over whether the classic
novel ``Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'' should be sold in the gift
shop, which is run by a historical association that considers the
book slanted in favor of Indians.
   The new superintendent aims to create a more historically
accurate presentation of what really happened when about 225
cavalry soldiers died with Custer on June 25, 1876.
   In 1988, Indian activists staged angry demonstrations on
horseback to protest the park service's museum exhibits, which they
say reflect the worshipful myths that have grown up around the
Custer story in the past century. Sixteen displays revolve around
the cavalry, while only eight depict Indian activities.
   The battle occurred soon after gold was discovered in the Black
Hills of the Dakotas and an influx of whites surged into lands
considered sacred by the Indians. The invasion of settlers and
miners followed on the heels of many broken treaties.
   In the spring of 1876, three Army columns numbering about 2,500
soldiers were dispatched into the territory to drive hostile Sioux
and Cheyenne bands onto reservations. Custer and his men were part
of that force, which ultimately succeeded in breaking the back of
Indian resistance in the West.
   ``My goal is to help convey the reasons for the battle and its
real significance,'' said Ms. Booher. ``I would like to update and
expand the exhibits, and the park brochure is going to be revised.''
   But she is quick to point out she cannot take unilateral action.
   ``It's not as easy to accomplish that as people think. We have
to follow the guidelines and policies that govern all changes in
parks, and those are already in place. I am merely an
administrator.''

<TEXT>
   A top priority is establishment of a monument to the Indians who
died at the battlefield. Marble headstones and two tall marble
markers authorized by Congress honor fallen white soldiers. Only a
painted board notes the death of Indians.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., the only Indian serving
in Congress and the proud possessor of a knife used by his
great-grandfather in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and Rep. Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont., are co-sponsors of legislation to authorize both
the Indian monument and a national design competition.
   Jim Court, a former superintendent who believes he was forced
out in 1986 because of ``philosophical differences'' with the park
service, lives in nearby Hardin and now raises money to buy land
around the battlefield. He believes the current Indian owners might
turn the acreage into tourist attractions, and the non-profit
organization he founded seeks to acquire the property and then deed
it to the park.
   Court, an avid devotee of the battlefield site, is highly
critical of Ms. Booher's management.
   ``I've been writing letters to congressmen to get things
changed,'' said Court. ``They (the park service) seem to have lost
sight of what they should be doing over there.''
   Ms. Booher's office, which formerly was Court's, offers a
sweeping view of the battlefield where so much blood was spilled so
long ago. But today, on a table beside the superintendent's desk,
there is an imposing statue of an Indian on horseback, his arm
raised, his lance ready. The bronze is titled ``The Warrior.''
   Yet there also is a framed poster quoting the legendary Chief
Joseph of the Nez Perce tribe: ``Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired; my
heart is sick and sad, from where the sun now stands I will fight
no more forever.''
   Barbara Booher, the only Indian woman superintendent in the park
service, has surrounded herself with meaningful symbols of a
complex heritage.
   ``All of life is a test, and I suppose this is part of that
test,'' she said. ``I feel like I was supposed to come here. ... I
am responsible for seeing that these resources are taken care of
for future generations of all people.
   ``And that is what I'm going to do.''

   On the
losers' side, there was no one left to tell the tale, to describe
the last moments of Custer's life, the valor of his troops, the
tactics of Sitting Bull, the cunning of Crazy Horse.
   The winners fled in all directions on their fleet ponies,
victorious Indians who'd just won the biggest, and last, battle in
their 300-year war against white encroachment into a bountiful land
that once had been all theirs.
   Later, their stories would be sought out not only by a
government seeking judgment against them, but also by historians,
scholars and a multitude of the curious. Each would tell a
different story.
   This much is for certain:
   The Battle of the Little Bighorn took place in what was then
Dakota Territory, 60 miles southeast of Billings, Mont.
   On June 25, 1876, a scorching Sunday, five companies of the 7th
Cavalry, numbering about 225 officers and troopers, advanced onto a
ridge above the Little Bighorn River. They were under the command
of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, then only 36 years old but
already a flamboyant, controversial Civil War hero.
   Below, along the riverbank, was an encampment of about 10,000 to
15,000 Indians, composed of Northern Cheyennes and Teton Sioux. The
Sioux actually were seven separate tribes: Hunkpapa, Blackfoot,
Oglala, Brule, Two Kettle, Sans Arc and Miniconjou.
   Custer ordered the attack. His troopers were vastly outnumbered
and outflanked. The soldiers, including two of Custer's brothers,
fought desperately but hopelessly against an estimated 2,500 to
4,000 Indian warriors. The rescue party found only mutilated
bodies. No soldier survived.
   Crazy Horse surrendered on May 6, 1877, at Camp Robinson, Neb.,
and was dead within six months, killed in a guardhouse fight.
Sitting Bull finally gave up in 1881 and died a broken man.
   Ever since that day 114 years ago, when Custer made his ``last
stand,'' says the National Park Service in its official handbook
for the Custer Battlefield National Monument, ``the full truth of
what happened has eluded the assiduous quest of countless students.
... Into the void has fallen such an accumulation of myth and
legend that an entranced public has little hope of distinguishing
truth from fiction.''
   An enormous body of literature has amassed because of the
battle. Countless poems and paintings have been inspired by it.
Generations have watched exaggerated film versions of the
historical event.
   ``Still the presses roll and the cameras turn,'' says the park
service booklet. ``... The public buys, the controversy rages, and
there is no consensus of what happened or why on that bleak Montana
ridge in America's centennial summer.''

   Stock prices may have risen to record highs this
year, but the game isn't getting any easier for small investors
trying to figure out how to play the bull market without getting
gored.
   What are they to make of an environment where the Dow Jones
industrial average can fall 100 points in about an hour's time, as
it did on the morning of Monday, July 23?
   Or how can anyone invest conservatively when supposedly stable
blue chips like American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, McDonald's and Dow
Chemical may suddenly nosedive, as they have done in recent weeks,
on even a mildly disappointing earnings report for a single
three-month period?
   ``It is hard to recall another time when one poor quarter, no
matter what the reason, could wipe out 20 to 25 percent of a
stock's value,'' said Jay Donnaruma, an analyst at First Albany
Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``It is downright scary. And that type of volatility will just
keep even more people away.''
   Amid all this seemingly chaotic activity, financial advisers see
some object lessons for what individual investors can, and cannot,
reasonably hope to achieve in stocks and stock-related investors.
   In the ``blue Monday'' market drop last week, for example,
William Brennan, a specialist in financial planning at the big
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, saw a clear message for small
investors.
   ``That kind of volatility indicates that they shouldn't be in
the market on a short-term basis,'' Brennan said.
   ``The prudent investor has to make a long-term commitment. To
me, long-term means for the foreseeable future, unless there is
some dramatic change in their own circumstances.''
   To further minimize the effects of short-term market
fluctuations, Brennan argues for a plan of regular, periodic
purchases, rather than attempting to buy at ``bargain'' prices.
   Such a strategy, he said, gives investors the benefit of a
system called dollar-cost-averaging, since over time fixed amounts
of their money will buy more shares whenever prices are low.
   Even if they have expertise, most small investors simply lack
the necessary time and tools to trade stocks short-term, analysts
say. Furthermore, frequent trading usually incurs heavy transaction
costs and taxes that increase the odds against success.
   A long-term investment, by contrast, avoids most of those
pitfalls, while giving investors a chance to participate in the
growth of the general economy and specific businesses.
   Greg Smith, an analyst at the investment firm of
Prudential-Bache Securities, says he believes individual investors
today are investing avidly in stocks, especially through mutual
funds, seeking to keep up with inflation in such important areas of
the economy as health care.
   ``More and more people perceive that inflation is a staple with
us, particularly in the service sector,'' Smith observed. ``They
know that as they age, they will have to buy services, particularly
health care services.''
   Stocks, he added, ``have about as good a track record as an
inflation fighter as anything else, and they tend to be more liquid
than alternative real assets such as real estate and collectibles.''
   While investing for the long term averts or minimizes some
significant risks, it is by no means a sure thing.
   People who opt to own individual stocks might be smart or lucky
enough to pick a company like Philip Morris, which increased about
tenfold in value from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, while
paying dividends that increased every year.
   Or they could wind up with a stock like Lomas Financial Corp., a
major firm in the mortgage banking business, which sold for more
than $22 a share as recently as 1988 and last week traded for less
than 50 cents.
   For a haven from such misadventure, many investors these days
turn to professional managers running diversified portfolios of
investments, such as mutual funds.
   In search of still more stability and certainty, of course, many
individuals steer clear of stocks in favor of interest-bearing
investments with stated values that don't fluctuate _ for instance,
bank certificates of deposit and money-market mutual funds.
   But the key problem with this sort of perceived safety, Brennan
says, is that ``you're always losing money to inflation.''

   At a business dinner in Paris, an American
executive scoops up a business card from a Japanese counterpart,
scribbles his number on it and hands it to a Saudi Arabian on his
left.
   Wrong, wrong and wrong, Dorothy Manning would say.
   Manning is a cultural consultant whose job is to guide
globe-trotting CEO's through the thicket of international customs
that can ensnare the best-planned business deal.
   For instance, she says, it's a faux pas to talk business over
dinner in France. Do so and you'll be seen as an oaf, fair game for
some cutting French wit.
   Similarly, one should never jot down a name or number on a
business card in Japan. Such cards are taken very seriously and
should not be treated in a cavalier manner.
   In Saudi Arabia, it is the height of poor manners to pass
documents with the left hand. Why? The left hand is used for
bathroom functions.
   ``Other countries are small, they depend on external commerce,''
Manning says. ``The Japanese thoroughly study us, and the Europeans
grew up in a situation where they have to deal with other
countries.''
   ``Up until now we've been so big and strong it hasn't been
necessary,'' Manning adds.
   No more.
   With Europe united, the Japanese economic juggernaut steaming
ahead and communism crumbling in the East bloc, American business
must compete in an ever-expanding global market. That means plenty
of opportunity for consultants like Manning, who charges between
about $350 and $750 a day per executive.
   Frank Mandicott, an international support services manager for
General Electric Aerospace in Syracuse, N.Y., said he has used
several such consultants. Although it can be difficult to persuade
corporate management to pay for cultural consulting, he doesn't
doubt the value.
   ``The money is well spent,'' Mandicott said Monday. ``If you go
abroad and offend your host and lose the contract, what's the cost
of that?''
   Manning says the central problem in doing business
internationally is establishing trust.
   ``People tend not to trust each other because they don't
understand each other,'' she says. ``If you see someone who dresses
differently, who has different customs, you're not sure they're
being open with you until you know that's normal for them.''
   Of course, what's normal from one country to the next can vary
quite widely.
   For instance, in many Moslem countries, written contracts don't
exist. And in Korea, contracts are viewed not as a binding pact but
a document from which to depart if conditions change.
   Other tips for the international executive:
   _ Don't send chrysanthemums to a colleague in France. They are a
symbol of death.
   _ Never show the sole of your foot to an associate in Saudi
Arabia. Doing so implies you feel you can tread upon someone, and
is very insulting.
   _ Holding up two fingers will get you a cab quickly in the
Soviet Union. But think twice before doing so _ two fingers mean
you'll pay double.
   But sometimes even the cultural consultants can err. Manning
organized 8 a.m. breakfast forums on business protocol for
international executives.
   All was well, until she realized that the timing for some might
be off.
   ``The Moroccans brought it up right away,'' Manning says. ``They
said they didn't get up that early.''

   After decades of trying to top unrealistic
production quotas, China appears to be setting its sights on an
economic restructuring similar to Soviet ``perestroika.''
   The economic plans still aim at the lofty goal of quadrupling
China's 1980 gross national product by the year 2000.
   But they are also intended to cure major impediments to economic
growth, including energy and transportation shortages and poor
management that have left almost one-third of the nation's
industrial capacity idle.
   Minister of the State Planning Commission Zou Jiahua told a
national conference on industrial production Sunday the government
is adjusting the economy to stop unnecessary production and to
stimulate markets that were stifled during the inflation-curbing
economic retrenchment that began in 1988.
   ``China's economy for the time being is not a question of
production speed, but the speed of the operation of the national
economy as a whole,'' the official Xinhua news agency quoted Zou as
saying.
   In addition to recent cuts in interest rates to stimulate
investment, the government has raised the state's purchasing price
for coal and allocated $1 billion for modernizing industries, Zou
noted.
   To stimulate demand for oversupplied items, he said, the state
monopoly's control over institutional purchases of office equipment
and furniture, color television sets, refrigerators and hotel
furbishings would be relaxed.
   Both China and the Soviet Union are struggling with major
structural adjustments but China's markets are full of goods,
unlike in the Soviet Union where stores are bare.
   The Russian term, ``perestroika,'' refers to the economic and
social restructuring of society to make it run more efficiently.
   The failure to revive the Chinese industrial economy despite
1988's austerity measures has raised fears of a recession.
   According to one official estimate, 34 percent of all Chinese
firms are in the red, a figure that climbs to more than 50 percent
in many areas. Shanghai's industrial output edged up only 0.8
percent from January to June, while production in most interior
provinces actually fell.
   An infusion of $4.2 billion in loans for slumping industries
from January to March _ double the amount for the same period in
1989 _ led mainly to further overstocking of unsold products.
   Many Chinese economists say fundamental structural problems _
namely poor quality and inefficiency resulting from inept
management _ are hindering the economic recovery.
   ``This country cannot afford to keep industry going by issuing
endless loans,'' Feng Rong'er, a director in the People's Bank of
China, told the English-language China Daily.
   ``It is high time to change the country's industrial structure
and product mix,'' Ms. Feng was quoted as saying.
   Premier Li Peng and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin, have also urged structural reforms.
   ``The market sluggishness that has appeared is not all-round
sluggishness. ... It is structural sluggishness ... mainly due to
the serious impropriety of our industrial structure resulting from
many years of old practices, the poor quality of enterprises and
the poor quality or non-marketability of some products,'' Li said
in an economic report earlier this month.
   Li said banks should increase loans earmarked for upgrading
enterprises and their equipment, improving energy conservation and
developing new products.
   Some economists have suggested that China adopt a shareholding
system for its state-owned enterprises, becoming a major
stockholder in firms that raise their own capital and engage in
profit-sharing.
   But the sheer size of China's economic problems, coupled with
the potential for political unrest, raises doubts as to just how
much efficiency-oriented planners will be able to achieve.

<HEAD>Eastern Supervisor Pleads Guilty in Maintenance Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Eastern Airlines foreman pleaded guilty
to falsifying maintenance records that allegedly allowed unsafe
airplanes to fly.
   Elia Dragone, 29, of Liberty Avenue in Jersey City, N.J., told a
federal judge Monday at his arraignment that he ignored vital
repairs but altered records to make it look like they had been done.
   He said he also falsified aircraft log books, work cards and
computer records to get Eastern aircraft into the air and avoid
costly flight delays and cancellations.
   He said the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors at the
airline.
   Dragone was the first employee of the troubled airline to plead
guilty to what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to overlook
maintenance problems.
   Eastern and nine of its managers were charged last week in a
60-count criminal indictment that alleges conspiracy to defraud the
government, wire fraud, falsification of documents and obstruction
of justice.
   Dragone, named in 20 counts of the indictment, pleaded guilty
before U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser Monday to two counts _
conspiracy and obstructing a Federal Aviation Administration
investigation into the airline.
   He faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count
when he is sentenced, scheduled for Oct. 17. He was allowed to
remain free on his own recognizance.
   In exchange for cooperating in the investigation, the government
will dismiss the other charges against Dragone and recommend
leniency in sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles W. Gerber
said.
   According to a four-page plea agreement signed June 18, Dragone
will testify at trials against Eastern and its employees. He will
also cooperate in investigations of the airline by the FAA and
other government agencies.
   Prosecutors could not say how long he worked for Eastern or when
he left the company.
   The indictment unsealed July 25 named Eastern and nine of its
high-level management employees, including Edward Upton, former
vice president of maintenance and engineering, and Thomas Lewis,
Eastern's maintenance director for the region from Washington to
Montreal.
   They and the other defendants are to be arraigned Aug. 6.
   The criminal indictment was unprecedented in the airline
industry.
   Eastern is struggling to regain passengers, rebuild service and
reorganize in bankruptcy court.
   The indictment, covering July 1985 to October 1989, alleged a
scheme to pressure and intimidate employees to ``keep the aircraft
in flight at all costs.''
   The probe began two years ago after an Eastern maintenance
supervisor voluntarily told federal prosecutors about
irregularities at the airline.
   No accidents or injury resulted from the alleged violations and
Eastern said it has taken ``full corrective action.'' The FAA said
the airline now meets safety standards.

<TEXT>
   Ball Corp. featured a picture of the world
on its 1989 annual report.
   That picture got a lot fuller on Monday when Ball announced it
was acquiring 33 European metal packaging plants from Continental
Can Co. Inc., giving the Muncie-based business a foothold in one of
the world's most rapidly expanding markets.
   ``I think it's fantastic,'' said analyst Timothy P. Burns of
Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, a Cleveland investment house. ``It fits in
with their annual report. It fills a void in Ball's global
franchise approach and trying to serve their major customers.''
   Continental will receive $625 million in cash and $400 million
in stock, giving it a 29 percent stake in Ball.
   In a separate deal, Ball said it would pay $65 million in cash
to purchase the remaining 50 percent in Ball-InCon Glass Packaging
Corp. from its partner in that venture, Holland-American Investment
Corp.
   The transactions would nearly triple Ball's 1989 sales of $1.22
billion and boost international revenues from 1 percent of total
sales to 46 percent, based on 1989 results of the companies.
   After previous failed ventures in Europe, Ball appears to have
finally scored with the Continental Can purchase, which complements
a Ball subsidiary in Canada and minority interests in joint
ventures in Taiwan and China.
   ``They've had a very large interest in becoming a big player in
Europe,'' Burns said. ``They've bought the crown jewel of the
Continental Can empire.''
   ``These things all have to happen at the right time, for the
right price and the right merchandise,'' said H. Edward
Schollmeyer, an analyst with PaineWebber. ``I think they got a very
good deal, and they have a lot of opportunities for future growth.
Both Coke and Pepsi-Cola are aggressively pushing their products to
Eastern Europe.''
   Ball, the fifth largest U.S. producer of beer and soft drink
cans, is a major can supplier to the cola giants and Ball Chairman
Richard M. Ringoen said his company hopes to ride their coattails
into Eastern Europe. Coca-Cola Co. receives 25 percent of its soft
drink cans in Europe from Continental.
   ``We really felt we needed a presence in Europe to spring
from,'' Chairman Richard M. Ringoen said. ``It has been on our
agenda for a long time.''
   Ball acquired 13 Continental plants in West Germany and one in
East Germany, providing a solid base to move into the East European
markets now opening up, Ringoen said.
   ``There's going to be a lot of opportunities in food containers
there,'' Ringoen said in a telephone conversation from New York,
where he and other company officials were meeting with analysts.
   Ball also acquires plants in northern France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Great Britain through the acquisition. Before, Ball
had only a small plastics operation in Northern Ireland and an
electronics operation in West Germany.
   Continental Can is a privately held business of Peter Kiewit
Sons' Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   Under the agreement, Ball will pay Kiewit $200 million in common
stock, $129 million of voting and $71 million of nonvoting
convertible, exchangeable preferred stock. The Kiewit stock will
represent a 29 percent voting interest in Ball. Kiewit will be
restricted from purchasing additional Ball shares.
   Ball will pay $65 million in cash for Holland-American's half
interest in the Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp., the joint venture
the two companies established in 1987, which now has 13 plants
across the United States.
   Both Ball-InCon and the European operations will be operated as
wholly owned subsidiaries of Ball Corp., with Ball In-Con retaining
its own financing.
   Continental Can Europe, which employs 10,000 people, had sales
of $1.47 billion in 1989 and projects sales this year to grow to
$1.66 billion. The company makes food, beverage and general metal
containers, metal closures and plastic containers.
   The deals should be completed before the end of the year, Ball
said. It is subject to approval by Ball shareholders and U.S. and
foreign government approval as well as Ball's obtaining financing.
   Last year Ball reported 63.9 percent of its sales came from
packaging products. Combined packaging sales of Ball, Continental
Can Europe and Ball-InCon last year would have been $2.78 billion,
the company said.
   Ball reported record sales and earnings for the quarter ending
June 30. Revenues were $381.9 million, up 13.3 percent from the
$337.2 million in sales in the second quarter of 1989. Income rose
25 percent to $18.8 million or 80 cents per share, from $15 million
or 64 cents per share.

   Consolidated Freightways Inc.'s board
has brought back former chief executive Raymond O'Brien to guide
the transportation company, stinging from large losses at its Emery
Worldwide airfreight subsidiary.
   The board picked O'Brien after chief executive Lary Scott
resigned Monday.
   J. Frank Leach, who has been on Menlo Park-based CF's board
since 1975, will hold the title of president and chief operating
officer while O'Brien takes on the CEO title in addition to his
current position as chairman.
   Emery was purchased under Scott's leadership last April for $478
million.
   In June, CF suspended its common-stock dividend for the first
time in 19 years.
   In July, it reported it lost $3.6 million, or 19 cents a share,
on revenue of $1.04 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 in
contrast to a profit of $9.1 million, or 19 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.04 billion a year earlier.
   Its stock has dropped to $14 a share from $34 a year earlier.
   O'Brien has been associated with CF for 32 years. He was CF's
president and chief executive for 11 years before retiring in 1988.

<HEAD>TV Service Being Launched in Pediatrician's Waiting Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients in dozens of pediatrician's offices are
going to be exposed to special video programs with commercials
starting this week.
   The service is called Healthlink Television. The executive
overseeing it, David Moore, said Monday that TV sets and video disc
players for showing the program would be in operation by Wednesday
in 100 pediatricians' offices in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Plans are to expand nationally to 2,500 doctors' offices by the
end of August, 5,000 by the end of September and 20,000 by early
1991, he said.
   Doctors will be given a one-hour program on a laserdisc that is
to be played continuously on the TV system during the business day.
The program will focus on health care topics with up to nine
minutes of commercials _ each two to four minutes long _ per hour
between program segments.
   Healthlink Television is the first of two commercially-sponsored
video programs that are being produced for audiences in medical
waiting rooms.
   Healthlink is a subsidiary of Hearst-ABC-Viacom Entertainment
Services, a joint venture of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the Hearst
Corp. and Viacom International Inc.
   The other video program is Special Reports Television, being
produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., and
debuting in October. Whittle is 50 percent-owned by the
entertainment giant Time Warner Inc.
   Both services are aimed principally at mothers visiting the
doctor either for themselves or with their children.
   They are the latest example of media vehicles developed to
enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences. Other
commercial targeted programming includes the Channel One news
program for teens in the classroom, programs for women at the
beauty parlor and a news show for shoppers in the grocery checkout
line.
   These efforts are contributing to the erosion of the audience
for network television and are being blamed partly for the weakness
in advertising for mass media such as the consumer magazines.
   Moore said Healthlink TV will be installed in September in
offices of obstetricians and gynecologists as well as those of
pediatricians and said that family practitioners will start getting
the service a month later. Separate programs, developed with advice
from doctors in each medical specialty, will be created each month
for each type of office.
   On the first Healthlink program, the only paid commercials are
for Tylenol, the pain reliever from Johnson &amp; Johnson. Public
service messages also were included.
   Moore said two other advertisers he declined to identify have
made firm commitments to sponsor the programs for family
practitioners.
   Healthlink also announced that it has signed three physicians
with experience in television as hosts for its three programs.
   Dr. Nancy Snyderman, a medical correspondent for ABC's ``Good
Morning America and KPIX-TV in San Francisco, will host the
pediatrics program.
   Dr. Holly Atkinson, vice president of programming and medical
affairs at the cable channel Lifetime Medical Television, will host
the programs for patients of obstetricians and gynecologists.
   Dr. Tim Johnson, medical editor for ABC News and Entertainment,
will host the family practice show.
   Whittle announced earlier this month that Joan Lunden, co-host
of ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' had signed a three-year contract
to host Special Reports TV shows.

<HEAD>Chrysler Reports Profit Dropped 47.2 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said today its second-quarter
profit plunged 47.2 percent from last year, mainly because of
incentive costs.
   The company said it earned $180 million, or 81 cents a share,
during the April through June period compared with $341 million, or
$1.46 a share, during the same period last year. Second-quarter
earnings last year were inflated by $8 million from the sale of
Chrysler's Gulfstream Aerospace Inc. subsidiary.
   Without the Gulfstream sale, its profit would be off only 46
percent from results of $333 million, or $1.42 a share, a year ago.
   Revenues fell 11.1 percent to $8.8 billion from $9.9 billion
during the April-June period last year.
   ``If not for the huge year-to-year increase in per-unit
incentive costs, we would have made more money this quarter than we
did in the second quarter of 1989,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
said. The company will not say specificialy how much it spent on
incentives during the quarter, but spokesman Tom Houston said it
was more than $1,000 for every car and truck sold.
   Chrysler's earnings were in line with Wall Street analysts'
expectations.
   For the first half of this year, Chrysler's earnings fell 63.7
percent to $251 million, or $1.13 a share, from $692 million, or
$2.96 a share, last year. Revenue for the first half dropped 15.8
percent to $16.5 billion from $19.6 billion.
   Last Thursday, General Motors Corp. said its second-quarter
profit fell 40 percent to $990.1 million, and Ford Motor Co. said
it made $770.7 million, down 45 percent from a year ago.
   GM and Ford blamed part of their decreases on economic problems
in Brazil, where both companies have large manufacturing factories.
Chrysler has a small overseas presence.
   Incentives ate into profits for each of the Big Three during the
second quarter. Ford Treasurer David McCammon said incentives cost
the automaker an average of $1,025 per vehicle sold during the
period. GM refused to release per-car incentive costs.
   Chrysler has been more bullish about using incentives to boost
sales than the other two companies. In January, for the first time
in history, Chrysler offered a $1,000 rebate on its popular
minivans and sales soared.
   But when the incentives expired, sales plummeted.
   Chrysler's car and truck sales through the first half of this
year ran 13 percent behind last year's pace. GM's were down 3.5
percent and Ford's were off 7.8 percent.
   Chrysler's profit in the first quarter dropped 80 percent, to
$71 million, compared with last year. Analysts and company
officials have estimated that the company won't make any money in
the third quarter, mainly because of retooling at its two minivan
plants, which interrupts production of some of the company's most
profitable vehicles.
   Automakers are wholesalers that make money on cars and trucks
sold to dealers. Consequently, when production stops, the company
loses money. The effects of production halts usually show up in
retail sales figures within three months, depending on inventory of
unsold vehicles.

   NEWMARKET-ON-FERGUS, Ireland (AP) _ The world's most powerful
agriculture ministers today played down a surprise proposal by the
European Community to cut global farm support by 30 percent over a
decade.
   The EC proposal was ``only a start,'' U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said.
   He made his comments at a news conference at the conclusion of a
two-day private meeting of the senior agriculture officials of the
United States, the EC, Japan, Canada and Australia.
   Japanese Agriculture Minister Tomio Yamamoto said the gathering
was ``not the place for negotiations.''
   ``We did not discuss substance and details,'' Yamamoto said.
   Canadian Agriculture Minister Donald Mazankowski told reporters
earlier: ``If you start from a distorted playing field and you
apply the 30 percent cuts ... you'd still end up with a distorted
playing field.''
   The EC commissioner, Ray MacSharry, made the proposal early
Monday at the so-called Quint meeting, which was held at Dromoland
Castle near Shannon in western Ireland.
   A dispute over Europe's huge farm subsidies is threatening the
successful conclusion of current global trade liberalization talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States and 14 other farm exporting countries want the
12-nation EC to end its export credits system and cut direct
subsidies for farmers, which the critics say distort trade.
   European Commission spokesman John Cooney, said that MacSharry's
proposal was an ``important initiative.''
   ``People have been saying the commission has been stalling,'' he
said Monday. ``The proposal has taken the lead in these talks.''
   But Mazankowski said, ``It's hard to really get a real fix on
it. Until we really see all the details it's very difficult to make
an accurate assessment.''
   He said the United States and Canada already may have
implemented such cuts.
   Mazankowski said ``What we're really after is specific
reductions in the three specific areas'' of market access, internal
support and export refunds.
   The Canadian minister added, ``We're going to enter into more
intense negotiations as we move forward.''
   The U.S. delegation said it would be inappropriate to negotiate
a proposal outside GATT's current Uruguay Round of talks. Ms. Shipp
noted that MacSharry, Yeutter and their colleagues were not the
actual GATT negotiators.
   MacSharry's proposed figure ``of course needs great
clarification and articulation,'' she said.
   However, the U.S. and EC teams continued to express confidence
that, with hard work, an overall GATT agreement would be reached on
time in December.
   MacSharry's proposed overall, 30 percent cut in farm support
covers the period 1986 to 1996 and includes EC cuts which already
have been implemented, Cooney said.
   Cooney cited achieved reductions of 10 percent in support for
crops and a 15 percent cut in livestock support.
   Details will be worked out and the proposal will be presented to
the European Commission in September, Cooney said. The commission
would have to approve the plan before it could be presented at
GATT, he said.
   GATT negoitators are to meet again in Geneva, Switzerland in
late August. They agreed at a meeting last week to compile lists
and costs of their farm support by Oct. 1.
   Complicating the negotiations are disagreements about how to
measure support.
   The developed world's farm subsidies cost consumers and
taxpayers $245 billion last year, according to the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   The cost to EC consumers and taxpayers' was $93 billion, to
Japan's $68 billion and the to United States' $46 billion, the
24-nation OECD said.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain On Soybean Strength, Lagging Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The early strength was centered in the soybean pit and rooted in
two factors: a strong cash market for soybeans and a weekly
government report that showed corn and soybean development still
lagging far behind the normal pace.
   In addition to higher cash prices for soybeans, analysts said
relatively few delivery notices were posted this morning at the
Board of Trade.
   Today is the first opportunity for traders to declare their
intent to deliver soybeans against the August contract. A low
number of notices indicates strong cash-market demand.
   Monday's weekly Agriculture Department crop-progress report
showed corn and soybean development still lagging far behind the
normal pace, although the crops were rated in very good condition.
   The slow pace of crop development is a function of heavy spring
rains, which delayed planting in some areas. An early frost in the
Midwest, which is considered unlikely, could damage late-maturing
soybeans, analysts said.
   ``That's the only thing the bulls can hang their hats on and it
won't mean much if we get a normal frost date,'' said Joel Karlin,
an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.94\ a bushel;
corn was 1 cent to 1\ cents higher with September at $2.62\ a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents higher with September at
$1.28} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5 cents higher with
August at $5.93 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with August at
78.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with August at 89.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent
to .45 cent higher with August at 61.05 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.65 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with August at
51.10 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on Monday.

<HEAD>Penny Stock Brokerage Files For Chapter 11</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., once the largest
penny-stock brokerage in the world, has filed for protection from
its creditors while it reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws.
   Blinder, Robinson said in a statement issued Monday that it has
ceased to do business as a brokerage. It said it intends to
transfer its 250,000 customer accounts and brokerage operations to
another, unidentified brokerage firm.
   Founder and President Meyer Blinder was not immediately
available for comment.
   Robert Davenport, head of the Security and Exchange Commission's
regional office in Denver, said the SEC has been aware of Blinder,
Robinson's teetering finances in recent weeks, but did not know of
the bankruptcy until Monday night.
   Once the largest penny-stock firm in the world, Blinder,
Robinson had shrunk to one-third its former size amid
investigations by federal regulators and investor lawsuits. It
recorded a loss of $14.8 million in 1988 and $11.7 million in 1989.
   Penny stocks are low cost, high risk securities, usually trading
for less than $3 per share. They are not listed on stock exchanges
and typically are used to raise capital for new or small companies.
   According to a filing made Monday with the SEC, Blinder,
Robinson owed its customers $4.8 million in cash and other
brokerage firms $400,000. The brokerage also owed customers and
other brokerage firms $70 million in securities, the filing said.
   Blinder, Robinson was the target of numerous state and federal
investigations. Blinder himself faces charges of racketeering and
wire fraud in indictments handed down earlier this year by a grand
jury in Nevada.
   Although the government lawsuits cost Blinder, Robinson millions
in legal fees over the past decade, a civil lawsuit won by one-time
Denver stockbroker Donald Walford may have been the last straw.
   Walford won a judgment worth about $5.7 million earlier this
month when the Colorado Supreme Court refused to hear any more
appeals from Blinder, Robinson. That judgment, which has not been
fully paid by the firm, had prompted Meyer Blinder to threaten
bankruptcy in recent weeks.
   In a state Supreme Court filing last week, Walford's attorney,
Steve Miller, told the court Blinder had threatened bankruptcy and
had told him, ``You took me out even though the SEC couldn't for
years _ you can tell that to the press.''
   Miller said Monday the bankruptcy might mean part of the $5.7
million judgment never will be paid. But he added, it also means
``my civil lawsuit has closed the doors to Blinder, Robinson.''
   Blinder _ who in 1987 paid himself $9.4 million while the
brokerage brought in about $138 million in revenues _ has taken a
battering this year from government regulators as well.
   On July 13 the SEC filed a $24 million lawsuit against the
self-proclaimed king of the penny stocks, just three days after he
lost the Supreme Court appeal to the Walford lawsuit. On April 27,
the SEC ordered Blinder out of the brokerage business and his firm
to be shut for 45 days. The order was stayed, however, pending
appeals.
   In the most critical blow delivered by the government, a federal
grand jury in Las Vegas, Nev., handed down an 11-count criminal
indictment in February. The indictment charged Blinder and four
other men with racketeering, securities fraud and conspiracy to
violate racketeering laws.
   In November 1988, Internal Revenue Service agents, along with
the SEC, staged a four-day raid at the Blinder Building looking for
evidence of money laundering and stock fraud. The evidence from
that raid served in the grand jury investigation.

<TEXT>
   A top federal regulator said today the fund
protecting commercial bank deposits is under ``very substantial
stress'' and probably will suffer a third consecutive loss this
year.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said, ``We may well have another loss in the current year.''
   He told the Senate Banking Committee the loss could drop
reserves in the fund to between 50 cents and 60 cents per $100 in
bank deposits.
   Speaking to reporters during a break in the hearing, Seidman
said ``it would not be unreasonable'' to predict a $2 billion loss
in the bank insurance fund, lowering reserves to roughly $11
billion.
   The fund has lost money in every year since 1988, when it began
with reserves of $18 billion. The fund is declining despite
increases in the insurance premiums paid by banks.
   Seidman said after a review of more than 1,000 problem banks in
the country his agency believes the fund is still adequate to
handle bank failures.
   ``At this point we believe we can handle anything we can see,''
he said.
   Seidman also said most bank and thrift customers are
ill-equipped to evaluate the health of the institutions where they
deposit their money.
   ``Only a small proportion of depositors have the resources and
ability to make informed judgments about the condition of a bank,''
he said.
   ``Even the best regulators, Wall Street types and financial
gurus have a very poor record of foreseeing banking problems much
in advance,'' he said in testimony prepared for the Senate Banking
Committee.
   Seidman, whose agency insures deposits at commercial banks and
thrifts, avoided commenting on specific proposals to revise deposit
insurance laws. But, he said any proposals designed to increase
depositor oversight of banks ``have their limitations.''
   In the wake of the S&amp;L debacle, many conservative economists
advocate scaling back deposit insurance. They argue that
depositors, knowing their money was protected by the government,
didn't care if they were putting it into institutions run by high
flyers.
   However, Seidman stressed requiring bank and thrift owners to
risk more of their own capital as a way to reduce managers'
temptation to take excessive risks.
   ``It seems appropriate that serious consideration should be
given to phasing in higher capital requirements for banks,'' he
said.
   Seidman's views are broadly consistent with those offered in
recent weeks by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Both expressed reluctance to lower the current
$100,000-per-account limit on deposit insurance, but commented
favorably on strong capital standards.
   However, both Brady and Greenspan expressed interest in trying
to limit deposit insurance to one account per person, a subject
Seidman did not address in his prepared remarks.
   The Treasury Department is studying the deposit insurance system
and is expected to offer recommendations for change by the end of
the year.
   Meanwhile, lobbyist Robert J. Thompson said he would refuse to
honor a subpoena from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, for testimony
before the Senate Judiciary antitrust committee today about his
role in arranging the purchase of a failed S&amp;L by Arizona insurance
executive James M. Fail.
   Thompson, a former aide to then-Vice President George Bush, said
in a two-hour interview with The Washington Post that he arranged
meetings for Fail and his associates with various federal officials
and was paid his regular fee, received backing for a $150,000 loan
and was promised 2 percent of the profits on the deal.
   The paper quoted Thompson as calling the subcommittee hearing
``a rigged game'' and saying: ``Senator Metzenbaum is not
interested in fair play or he truth about the Bluebonnet
transaction. He is interested only in headlines.''
   Thompson's lawyer, Stanley M. Brand, former chief counsel for
the House of Representatives, said Thompson is refusing to comply
with the subpoena because Metzenbaum's subcommittee is exceeding
its jurisdiction by probing Thompson's personal and business
finances and has violated his privacy by leaking confidential
information to the news media.
   Metzenbaum has asked Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee to schedule a vote for Thursday on
compelling Thompson to comply with the subcommittee subpoena.
   Separately, a senior Treasury Department official suggested
Monday that Congress could avoid voting on a $100 billion savings
and loan bailout for 1991 until next year by passing a stopgap bill
for no more than $10 billion.
   The proposal, which would postpone action on the larger
appropriation until after the November election, was raised by
Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber.

<HEAD>Interco, Creditors Agree on Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., which has been struggling to pay
off its large junk-bond debt, has reached a basic restructuring
agreement with its creditors, a company spokesman announced Tuesday.
   The deal between the footwear and furniture maker and its banks,
medium term noteholders and subordinated debenture holders
apparently will keep the company from going into bankruptcy.
   Although no details of the agreement were released Tuesday, the
company did say it will not be required to make any principal or
interest payments on its bonds until October as part of the
agreement.
   The waiver of payments includes a $3.8 million interest payment
that was due Monday and also allows Interco to make an $8.6 million
interest payment that was due July 16 sometime before Aug. 15.
   ``As we have stated previously, Interco has four successful core
companies. However, Interco's debt is much larger than these
companies can support. We believe that the financial restructuring
under discussion will alleviate the problems caused by Interco's
excessive debt levels ...,'' said Richard Loynd, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Negotiations on the restructuring are continuing, Loynd said,
and more details will be released soon.
   Interco, based in St. Louis, was a diversified manufacturer
until 1988 when it was forced to borrow $1.65 billion to fend off a
hostile takeover attempt.
   Since then, the company has been selling off subsidiaries in an
attempt to repay its debts. It has retained four companies:
Converse Inc., Florsheim shoes, Lane Co. and Broyhill Furniture
Industries.
   However, Interco's debt repayment plan faltered when Interco
subsidiaries brought far less than the company had anticipated and
company officials began looking for ways to restructure its debts.
   In June, the company told subordinated debenture holders that it
wouldn't be able to make a scheduled interst payment and instead
asked bondholders to convert their bonds to common stock.
   Under that plan, which is still pending before the Securities
Exchange Commission, the holders of Interco's senior subordinated
debentures due in 2000 were asked to exchange $1,000 principle
amount of those bonds for 70 shares of Interco common stock and
$900 principle amount of a new issue of 6 percent accrual
convertible debentures.

<HEAD>Government Report Says Japan Should Share More Technology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trade ministry said Tuesday the nation should
begin sharing its technical prowess with the rest of the world,
partly to help ease foreign trade friction.
   An advisory report released by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry said Japan should sell more technology overseas
and should welcome increased numbers of foreign researchers at
government and private institutes.
   It said Japanese companies' voracious appetite for new
technology causes the country to import more foreign technology
than it exports in the form of patent royalties and proprietary
rights, despite its growing technological prowess.
   ``It's time to look to see what are the root causes of trade
irritation, and as a country which now produces 15 percent of the
world's gross national product, to cope with them as quickly as
possible,'' said Hidetoshi Nishimura, director of the ministry's
Machinery and Information Industries Bureau.
   ``After attaining economic growth on the basis of technology
imported from the West, it is time for Japan to export its
technology to the rest of the world,'' he said.
   He said the ministry would try to encourage transfers of
technology by creating ``favorable conditions,'' including tax
credits, in a program being formulated.
   Private companies pay for about 80 percent of Japan's research
and development, compared with less than 50 percent in the United
States, and carefully guard their technology from rival businesses.
This has led to questions about whether they would be willing to
share their most advanced technology with foreign interests.
   Last year, Japanese companies were the top four recipients of
patents in the United States and reportedly filed nearly half the
patents in the world.
   In the 1960s and 1970s, before the development of extensive
private Japanese research capabilities, the trade ministry played
an important role in guiding Japanese research efforts for
developing key technologies in areas such as computers and
semiconductors.
   But as trade friction has intensified in recent years,
especially with the United States, the ministry has begun pursuing
a reversal of its export-first orientation.
   The report said Japan bought $439 million more technology from
overseas in 1988 than it sold, while the United States sold $7.3
billion more than it acquired.
   The ratio of Japanese technology exports to imports has
increased but remains at a deficit, Nishimura said.
   About 87,000 Japanese researchers were working aboard in other
industrialized nations during 1988, while only about 9,000
researchers from those countries were in Japan, the report said.
   Nishimura said the growing costs of research in basic science
also have increased the need for international cooperative research
programs and for Japan, as a wealthy country, to take a stronger
role.
   ``In the past, Western nations took a leading role in the
exchange of research. Now is the time for Japan to do so,'' he said.
   The ministry is preparing budget requests for implementation of
the report, which was prepared by a committee of academics and
officials from companies such as Sony, Hitachi and Toyota,
Nishimura said.

<TEXT>
   The government plans to sell a 20.4 percent
stake in the national telephone company by Dec. 20, the first stage
in Mexico's largest privatization effort, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
   The current value of Telefonos de Mexico shares is more than $8
billion About half of them are held by the government, which would
give up control of the company with its sale of the 20.4 percent
stake.
   The reports said the ministry of finance and the Banco
Internacional, financial agent for the sale, said that while
foreign investors could participate, control of the company would
remain in Mexican hands.
   The daily newspaper El Financiero quoted officials as saying the
government intended to sell 10.4 percent to Mexicans and 10 percent
to foreign investors.
   The finance ministry said the overall price for the 20.4 percent
stake would be between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion.
   It said that within a year, the government would sell all of its
shares, valued at more than $4 billion.
   El Financiero said foreign interest is coming from Telefonia
Espanola, Bell Canada, Britain's Cable and Wireless, France
Telephone and the former Bell System companies US West and
Southwestern Bell in the United States.
   The reports said Banco Internacional plans to announce terms of
the auction between Aug. 13 and Sept. 7 as well as principles for
qualifying purchasers.
   They said the bank planned to make bids be due on Nov. 15 after
a period for visits to Telmex facilities and questions by potential
buyers and winning bidders would be notified and payment of
guarantees arranged between Dec. 4 and Dec. 20.
   Banco Internacional said the sale would be designed to insure
Mexican control, guarantee rights of workers and their
participation in capital, improve service, encourage continued
growth and strengthen technological investment.

<HEAD>New Director Named For European Rocket Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arianespace named Director-General Charles Bigot to
the post of president on Tuesday, replacing Frederic d'Allest as
head of Europe's successful commercial satellite launch program.
   D'Allest announced his retirement last Wednesday after an Ariane
rocket placed West German and French television satellites into
orbit.
   It marked the 37th Ariane mission and the first since Feb. 22,
when a rocket carrying two Japanese satellites exploded shortly
after liftoff above the Ariane launchpad at Kourou, French Guiana.
   ``It's a great responsibility vis-a-vis the international
community of space users, almost all of whom are our clients,''
said Bigot in accepting the promotion from the Arianespace board of
directors.
   Bigot, 58, had served in the consortium's second highest post
since 1982. He and d'Allest won more than half the world's
lucrative satellite launch business for Ariane's unmanned rockets.
   A graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique, Bigot worked as a
research chief on rocket engines at the National Center of Space
Studies on the first French civil rocket, the Diamant-B.
   He headed the development department of the domestic airline Air
Inter from 1971-75 and served as the commercial director at
Aerospatiale before coming to Arianespace eight years ago.
   D'Allest had led Arianspace since its creation in 1980 as the
commercial partner of the European Space Agency.

<HEAD>Trading Halted on Five Commodity Exchanges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trading on New York's five commodity exchanges
was halted four times Tuesday with the longest outage about 40
minutes because of a data transmission problem, officials said.
   An American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. spokswoman said a wire
problem at AT&amp;T's central office in Manhattan prevented data from
being disseminated to customers off the trading floor.
   Trading was halted at the Commodity Exchange, the nation's main
metals market; the New York Mercantile Exchange, the main oil
trading market; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Cotton
Exchange; and the New York Futures Exchange.
   Action first came to a standstill at 11:03 a.m. EDT, when the
exchanges discovered that no price quotes were leaving the
building, and resumed at 11:42 a.m. Trading was halted again at
11:52 a.m. and resumed seven minutes later.
   Two more stoppages, lasting one minute and two minutes, occurred
within the next half hour, said a Commodity Exchange official who
asked not to be named.
   ``We're investigating why it happened,'' AT&amp;T spokeswoman Carol
Alrbight said.
   The five exchanges share a trading floor in the World Trade
Center in lower Manhattan. Trading information was not interrupted
within the building, officials said.
   The glitch affected futures wires but not options wires, the
Comex official said, though trading in all products at the
exchanges were interrupted. Officials said the stoppage and trading
resumption was orderly.
   In April, the five New York futures and options markets shut
down about four hours early after a communications glitch prevented
thousands of traders, brokers and investors from receiving price
data.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House today threatened to veto
legislation making its way through Congress aimed at curbing ``junk
mail'' on fax machines and telephone-answering devices.
   White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said the measure
was unnecessary.
   ``The number of complaints are small and there are already
systems and infrastructures in place to deal'' with the problem,
she said.
   By voice vote, the House approved legislation Monday to
authorize the Federal Communications Commission to set up a
national clearinghouse for listing telephone subscribers who object
to the endless faxes and unsolicited messages. The Senate has not
yet acted on the bill.
   ``This legislation empowers consumers and businesses with the
ability to `just say no' to unsolicited telephone advertisements,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Under the bill, the FCC also would establish penalties for
advertisers who fail to abide by the clearinghouse list.
   Solicitations by charitable and political organizations would be
exempt from the ban.
   Consumers, either private individuals or businesses, could
specify that they do not wish to receive advertising by fax
machines or automatically dialed, prerecorded telephone
solicitations.
   The legislation was crafted with help from the FCC, the
telephone industry and the direct marketing industry, Markey said.

<HEAD>EC Commission Allows British Steel, Usinor-Sacilor To Grow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission said
Tuesday it cleared the way for the trade bloc's two largest steel
producers, France's Usinor-Sacilor SA and British Steel PLC, to
expand into specialist markets.
   The Commission said in a statement Usinor-Sacilor's Sollac unit
can purchase Societe des Forges de Basse-Indre and CMB Acier from
their parent company, Anglo-French packaging specialist CMB SA. It
would make Sollac the largest EC producer of tin plate.
   The Commission said that in 1988 Sollac made 685,000 tons of tin
plate for the packaging industry. CMB Acier made 323,000 tons. It
did not say how much of the tin plate market Sollac would now
command, but in 1988 Sollac made 23.1 percent of tin plate in the
Community.
   In allowing the acquisition, the Commission noted the growing
competition from aluminum, paper, plastic and glass makers in the
packaging industry.
   The Commission also said British Steel could acquire ``certain
assets and debts'' of Klockner Stahl GmbH of West Germany, raising
its share of the EC market to 24 percent from 22 percent.
   In other decisions on the steel sector Tuesday the Commission
approved a joint venture between Belgian steel maker Arbed SA and
Preussag Salzgitter AG of West Germany.
   Although Arbed and Preussag make about 23 percent of reinforced
steel in the EC, they only control between 0.5 percent and 2.2
percent of the British market, where they plan to set up their
joint venture. AP Steel UK Ltd. will sell the two companies
reinforced steel products in Britain.
   The Commission said the two steel makers would not be able to
create an ``artificially privileged'' position for the new company
in Britain.

<TEXT>
   A civil rights leader indicated today
that an agreement was near that would lead him to call off protests
during next week's PGA Championship at a heretofore all-white
country club.
   The Rev. Abraham Woods, Birmingham president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, said, ``it seems as if we may be
able to put this thing behind us.''
   Woods said an announcement on the matter would be made later in
the day and that a Shoal Creek country club representative would
attend.
   Woods had threatened to lead protests during the Aug. 9-12 PGA
stop because the founder of the all-white Shoal Creek club, Hall
Thompson, said last month that the private club south of Birmingham
would not be pressured into accepting black members.
   Thompson later apologized, saying his remark had been taken out
of context, and the city's black mayor and others have been working
behind the scenes for days to try to defuse the issue. His office
had no immediate comment today on the report of a possible
settlement.
   Woods said in a telephone interview that he was asking that
Shoal Creek immediately take in the mayor, Richard Arrington, who
is black, as an honorary member ``with all rights and privileges,''
and start the process of accepting two other Birmingham blacks who
have said they wanted to join as regular members.
   ``We are hopeful that their response will be such that they will
accept it and we can put this thing behind us,'' he said.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Atlanta-based SCLC, was
to attend the news conference in City Hill along with Arrington;
Jim Awtrey, executive director of the PGA; and an unnamed Shoal
Creek official, Woods said.
   An honorary membership for Arrington and a start on accepting
the two others ``would be practical steps,'' Woods said. ``We're
not fishing for policy steps on paper. Mayor Arrington as an
honorary member would break the color barrier. Then they can start
the process on other blacks and we can let the process run its
course.''
   It takes about six months for a proposed member to be accepted
by Shoal Creek on an expedited basis.
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Lee Trevino, who won the 1984 PGA
at Shoal Creek, said he has decided to take part in this year's
tournament after saying last week he was having second thoughts
about it.
   ``He is planning on being there,'' Judy Pierre of Lee Trevino
Enterprises said today from Dallas.
   On Monday, the NBC-owned TV station for Los Angeles had joined
the protest, saying it would not show highlights of the
championship. And Spalding Sports Worldwide, the nation's largest
golf ball manufacturer, said it was pulling its ads, as several
other companies did last week.
   Burbank, Calif.-based KNBC, the network's second-largest
affiliate, would report only the results of the tournament, said
the station's sports director, Fred Roggin.
   ``We're not trying to ignore the golfers or the fans of golf,''
said Jeff Hoffman, a sports producer at KNBC. ``Our stance is
directed at the course. We're not interested in publicizing or
showing the course on our station.''
   The tournament will be televised on ABC and on ESPN, the cable
sports network.

   Borden Inc. said Tuesday its profit rose 7.7
percent in the second quarter despite a sharp decline in results
from its dairy business.
   The company's other division, which are grocery and specialty
products, snacks and international consumer products and packaging
and industrial products, each posted higher operating results for
the period.
   Borden said it earned $90.4 million, or 61 cents a share, in the
three months ended June 30 compared with $83.9 million, or 57 cents
a share, a year ago.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 0.7 percent to $1.90 billion from
$1.89 billion a year earlier.
   The company said operating income fell 35 percent in its dairy
division as Borden continued to withdraw from the depressed fluid
milk markets and to reconfigure production in its remaining
regional markets.
   By the end of the quarter, it had closed or sold 12 dairy plants
and was working on the sale of six others.
   But operating income rose 17.2 percent in the grocery products
division, which includes brands such as Prince pasta, Borden
cheeses, Wyler's bouillon and Mrs. Grass dry soup mixes, and 18.4
percent in snacks which include Wise Foods and Moore's snacks.
   Operating income also rose 7.7 percent in the packaging and
industrial products business.
   For the first half, Borden said it earned $153.5 million, or
$1.04 per share, up 7.4 percent from $143.0 million, or 97 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $3.8 billion from $3.71 billion a
year earlier.

   Chiquita Brands International on Tuesday said
second-quarter earnings increased to $46.4 million compared with
$43.9 million a year ago, due to the company's fresh foods
operations.
   Per share earnings increased to $1.10 from $1.08, while sales
for the quarter ending June 30 were $1.1 billion, up from $1
billion a year ago.
   The company attributed the sales and earnings increases to
favorable pricing and volume in its fresh foods operations,
primarily the sale of bananas in Europe.
   Chiquita, which exports 50 million cases of bananas a year from
Honduras, or about two-thirds of that nation's banana crop,
announced a settlement Monday in a month-long strike by 10,000
banana workers.
   Chiquita said it agreed to a 25.4 percent raise in the basic
wage for workers, increasing their wages by $62.50 to $308.50 a
month.
   The earnings announcement by Chiquita said profits for the first
half of the year were $89.3 million, or $2.12 a share, compared
with $53.6 million, or $1.32 a share, during the first half of
1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, compared with $1.9 billion.
   President Keith E. Lindner said although the company usually
earns 85 percent of its annual profits in the first half of the
year, first-half profits already have exceeded the projections for
the entire year.

<HEAD>Interco, Creditors Agree on Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., the manufacturing firm that
nearly destroyed itself by using junk bonds to fend off a hostile
takeover attempt, apparently has solved its nagging debt woes.
   The company, which owns Converse and Florsheim footwear
companies along with furniture manufacturers Lane Co. and Broyhill
Industries, announced a basic restructuring agreement with its
creditors Tuesday.
   The deal between the St. Louis-based company and its banks,
medium-term noteholders and subordinated debenture holders
apparently will keep the company from entering bankruptcy
proceedings.
   It was reached after four days of marathon meetings in New York
involving 50 to 60 people representing the various creditors.
   ``We all felt that Interco was basically a very sound operation
that had the terrible misfortune of getting trapped with a terrible
balance sheet,'' said Wilbur Ross, senior managing director of
Rothschild Inc., which served as chief negotiator for subordinated
debenture holders.
   ``This was a situation that deserved a peaceful ending rather
than a contentious one.''
   The agreement involves restructuring about $1.9 billion in bank
loans, bonds and other corporate notes.
   Interco took on $1.65 billion in debt in 1988 in an effort to
protect itself from a takeover attempt by corporate raiders Steven
and Michael Rales of Washington.
   At the time, the company made men's and women's apparel,
operated 201 retail stores such as do-it-yourself hardware stores
and discount clothing stores, and owned footwear and furniture
companies.
   To pay off its debt, the company announced plans to sell off all
of its companies except the four it currently operates.
   However, the plan faltered when Interco subsidiaries brought far
less than the company had anticipated. That, coupled with the
junk-bond market collapse, left the company with more debt than it
started with.
   Company officials were forced to look for another solution.
   Although no details of the restructuring agreement were released
Tuesday, the company did say it will not be required to make any
principal or interest payments on its bonds until October.
   The waiver of payments includes a $3.8 million interest payment
that was due Monday and also allows Interco to make an $8.6 million
interest payment that was due July 16 sometime before Aug. 15.
   ``As we have stated previously, Interco has four successful core
companies. However, Interco's debt is much larger than these
companies can support. We believe that the financial restructuring
under discussion will alleviate the problems caused by Interco's
excessive debt levels,'' said Richard Loynd, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Additional details will be released after the various parties
review and approve the basic agreement, Interco officials said.
   ``We're now putting everything on paper and making sure that
everything that we put down is actually what we agreed to,'' Ross
said. ``But the main accomplishment is that we've reached an
agreement that will put the company in a very good position to move
forward.''
   Ross said Tuesday's agreement will include general provisions of
a proposal made by the company in June that asked bondholders to
accept common stock in exchange for their bonds.

   Prices were narrowly mixed in uncertain trading
on Wall Street today as the stock market remained apprehensive
about the future of the economy.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which reversed course several
times through the day, was down 1.98 to 2,915.35 as of 3 p.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues held a margin of 8 to 7 over decliners, with
781 stocks rising, 696 falling and 486 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.71 million shares with an
hour of trading left.
   Analysts said the market was playing it safe with several big
economic reports due out this week.
   The government was announcing its index of leading economic
indicators on Wednesday. The National Association of Purchasing
Management was also releasing its monthly survey on the
manfacturing economy Wednesday.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said many
investors stayed out of market because of growing concern that the
country might be heading into a recession.
   ``When in doubt, do nothing'' was the attitude on Wall Street,
Metz said.
   UAL, which fell more than 6 points Monday amid signs its latest
employee buyout plan was in trouble, plunged another 16~ to 140.
   Oil stocks were one of the bright spots, benefiting from a rise
in crude prices. The September contract for West Texas Intermediate
oil was up 49 cents to $20.70 a barrel in late afternoon.
   Atlantic Richfield rose 2\ to 130, Chevron gained 1{ to 79|,
Exxon was up 1 to 51}, and Texaco was up 1&lsqb; at 64.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.33 to 194.51. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 0.46 to 353.19.

<HEAD>Ford, Fiat In Agricultural Joint Venture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat Group, Italy's largest industrial company,
and Ford Motor Co. formed a joint venture Tuesday to merge their
agricultural subsidiaries into a new company controlled by Fiat.
   The move further's Ford's goal of ridding itself of its
non-automotive operations. Last week, Ford announced it was
entering final negotiations with the Loral Corp. of New York over
the sale of Ford Aerospace Corp.
   In the agreement announced Tuesday, which must be approved by
the Italian and U.S. governments, FiatGeotech would merge with Ford
New Holland. Ford would receive an undisclosed amount of cash and
own 20 percent of the joint venture, while FiatGeotech would own
the other 80 percent.
   ``Our primary objective in creating this new company is to
profit from the existing strengths of the two subsidiaries,'' said
Cesare Romiti, Fiat's president and chief executive officer. ``We
recognize that these two organizations, when combined, will
complement each other remarkably well with a truly global presence
in virtually every world market.''
   The two parent companies have been involved in negotiations over
the agricultural operations merger for months. The subsidiaries
make agricultural implements, such as tractors and combines.
   FiatGeotech has more than 13,000 employees in Italy, Brazil,
France and the United States, and reported 1989 revenues of $2.3
billion. Ford New Holland has about 18,000 workers in plants and
offices in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and
Brazil, and collected $2.8 billion in revenues last year.
   The parent companies said Fiat would continue current pay and
benefits for Ford New Holland employees, who are covered by
contracts negotiated by the United Auto Workers union.
   The companies also said the subsidiaries' worldwide markets and
identities would be preserved in the joint venture.
   The Ford-Fiat deal is the first overseas venture announced by
Ford since the U.S. automaker bought the British luxury carmaker
Jaguar PLC late last year for $2.5 billion.
   So far this year, General Motors Corp. has announced deals in
Hungary, East Germany and the Soviet Union. Chrysler Corp. has
linked up with an Austrian company in a minivan program.
   Ford has said it is discussing with Fiat a deal separate from
Tuesday's joint venture that would involve the two companies' heavy
truck businesses.
   There has been speculation in Italy and the United States that
Fiat may be talking with Chrysler Corp. about Fiat possibly buying
a stake in the financially struggling U.S. automaker.
   Officials from Fiat and Chrysler have declined to comment on the
speculation.

<HEAD>Second-Quarter Profit Falls at USX, Wheeling-Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said Tuesday its second-quarter profit fell 15
percent, while another steel maker, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel
Corp., reported a 33 percent drop in earnings for the same period.
   Pittsburgh-based USX cited reduced steel earnings and a loss on
the sale of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. assets.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh, based Wheeling, W. Va., and operating under
federal bankruptcy protection, said reduced shipments and a market
glut contributed to its profit decline.

<HEAD>USX Corp.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest steel maker said its net income totaled
$212 million, or 81 cents per share, in the three months ended June
30, compared with $250 million, or 91 cents per share, a year
earlier.
   Sales fell 8 percent to $4.63 billion from $5 billion, USX said.
   The current quarter included special pre-tax charges totaling
$99 million, in part to cover the loss from the sale of three Texas
Oil &amp; Gas packages the company expects to sell by the end of
September.
   The charges also included the cost of a proxy solicitation on
investor Carl Icahn's bid to spin off the company's steel division.
The proposal was defeated by shareholders.
   Operating income fell nearly 12 percent to $400 million from
$452 million in the quarter.
   Nonetheless, USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said ``operating
income has maintained the pace of 1989's record earnings, excluding
last year's special items and operating profits from businesses
sold.''
   ``The long-term outlook for both energy and steel continues to
improve,'' he said.
   The steel segment reported operating income fell 53 percent to
$80 million from $171 million. Sales fell to $1.4 billion from $1.6
billion.
   The steel decline was due to lower steel prices and the absence
of operating income due to the sale of the Lorain, Ohio, works to a
50 percent owned joint venture in the second quarter of 1989, the
company said.
   The company's energy segment reported operating income increased
17 percent to $285 million in the second quarter from $244 million
in the year-ago period.
   For the first half of the year, USX said net income fell 29
percent to $388 million, or $1.48 per share, compared with $546
million, or $2 per share.
   First-half revenue dipped to $9.32 billion from $9.42 billion a
year earlier.

   Wheeling-Pittsburgh said its net income totaled $38.5 million,
or $7.04 per share, for the three months ended June 30 compared
with $57.5 million, or $10.76 per share, a year earlier.
   Sales for the second quarter were $287.1 million on shipments of
575,271 tons, compared with sales of $301.1 million on shipments of
591,657 tons in the year-ago quarter.
   Operating income fell 31 percent to $33.3 million from $48.4
million in the quarter, the steelmaker said.
   ``We were down in our shipments and our price is softer,'' said
company spokesman Ray Johnson. ``The market isn't as good as it was
a year ago.''
   For January-June 1990, net income was $74.1 million, or $13.52
per share, down 28 percent from $103.3 million, or $19.25 per
share, in the year-ago period, the company said.
   Sales for the first six months were $544 million on shipments of
1.08 million tons compared with sales of $588.6 million on
shipments of 1.17 million tons a year earlier.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh filed for Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors in April 1985.
   The negotiating committee for 5,500 United Steelworkers union
members has said it would ask union chief Lynn R. Williams to
authorize a strike Aug. 16.
   The USW members are making steel under a concessionary contract
they accepted after a three-month strike in 1985. The accord
expires 10 days after a reorganization plan is confirmed.
   The Wheeling-based company employs 5,500 union and 1,600
non-union workers in western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.

<HEAD>Dutch Firm Buys Famous Toy Store Chain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prestigious Dutch retailer on Tuesday
announced it is buying FAO Schwarz, a venerable old American toy
store chain known to generations of shoppers as the ultimate place
to browse for playthings.
   The U.S. subsidiary of NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer (KBB)
will acquire the 17 stores operated by FAO Schwarz as well as its
catalog business for an unannounced price.
   Officials disclosed few details of the deal with FAO Schwarz's
present owners, an investment group that includes the chain's two
highest ranking executives.
   The acquisition will give KBB an entry into American retailing
and provide the Dutch company with a springboard from which to
expand in the United States.
   ``FAO Schwarz is the pre-eminent retailer of fine toys in the
world and we are committed to building on FAO's tradition of
excellence,'' Arie Maas, chairman of KBB, said in a news release.
   Peter L. Harris, president and chief executive officer of FAO
Schwarz, said in an interview that he foresees the chain moving
into Europe and Japan after the acquisition.
   Harris said he and his management team will continue in their
current roles. But Chairman Peter C. Morse, who along with Harris
led the investment group that bought FAO Schwarz in 1986, is
leaving.
   The New York-based toy store company, which was founded in 1862,
was family owned for about its first 100 years. After a succession
of corporate owners, it was bought by Swiss retailer Franz Carl
Weber in the late 1970s.
   Although its reputation didn't suffer much among casual
customers, FAO Schwarz lost some of its luster in the early '80s,
analysts say. Harris said annual sales were below $20 million when
the investment group bought it in the mid-1980s.
   He said the chain's sales are expected to exceed $50 million
this year.
   Analysts credit the current management with restoring FAO
Schwarz's stature within the industry and say the chain again is
highly regarded for innovative merchandising.
   FAO Schwarz has managed to prosper in a difficult retailing
environment by emphasizing service and taking a creative approach
to displaying merchandise, Harris said. The merchandise itself,
such as an eight-foot stuffed giraffe that sells for $4,500, also
sets the store apart from other toy retailers.
   FAO Schwarz operates two big stores, one in New York and the
other in San Francisco. The store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue is a
major tourist attraction. Much smaller branches are located in
urban settings, including Boston, Chicago and Palm Beach, Fla., as
well as in suburban malls. A new store opened recently in Beverly
Hills, Calif., and openings are planned for later this year in
Denver and Short Hills, N.J.
   Harris said FAO Schwarz soon will announce plans for a much
larger store in Chicago, on a scale with the flagships in New York
and San Francisco. He said the company is in lease negotiations for
a bigger store in Boston as well.
   KBB has more than a dozen department store chains, including one
that specializes in elaborate toys like those sold by FAO Schwarz.
That chain, the Bijenkorf chain, is at the luxury end of its
operations, selling exclusive fashions, cosmetics and furniture as
well as toys.
   Its flagship store is a landmark in the center of Amsterdam,
right across the street from the city's royal palace.
   In recent years, the Bijenkorf _ beehive in Dutch _ has
diversified into fancy foods and established one of the
Netherlands' largest specialty cosmetics departments.
   KBB also owns the low-priced HEMA chain known for its
serviceable household goods and clothing on the model of an
American variety store.
   All together, the holdings of the $2.2 billion retailer in its
home country and elsewhere in Europe included 1,200 stores at the
end of last year.

   Prices closed mixed on Wall Street today amid
continued apprehension about the economy and pessimism about
takeover stocks.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fluctuated in a narrow range
for much of the day as investors traded cautiously in advance of
several big economic reports due out this week.
   But in the last half-hour of trading, stocks took a sharp dive,
with the Dow Jones average dropping nearly 39 points, as
computer-program traders began to sell heavily. The average
recovered some ground, but closed down 12.13 at 2,905.20.
   A steep decline in the price of UAL Corp. stock set off the drop.
   The trade publication American Banker said today that Citicorp
and Chase Manhattan Corp. representatives did not attend a meeting
Friday on possible bank financing for the planned $4.38 billion
employee buyout of the parent of United Airlines. The report cast
doubt on the viability of the deal.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said many
investors stayed out of market because of growing concern that the
country might be heading into a recession.
   ``When in doubt, do nothing'' was the attitude on Wall Street,
Metz said.

<HEAD>Ministers Express Reservations About Aid Cut Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NEWMARKET-ON-FERGUS, Ireland (AP) _ The world's leading
agriculture ministers Tuesday expressed reservations about a
surprise European proposal to cut farm aid worldwide but said it
was a step forward.
   The European Community's agriculture commissioner, Ray MacSharry
of Ireland, on Monday proposed cutting world farm aid by 30 percent
over a decade, intensifying the debate over Europe's huge farm
subsidies.
   The dispute over Europe's support for its farmers will not, as
feared, block the successful conclusion in December of current
global trade liberalization talks, the senior officials said.
   MacSharry and the agriculture ministers of the United States,
Japan, Canada and Australia made their comments at a news
conference at the conclusion of a two-day private meeting.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the proposal is
``only a start in the negotiating process.''
   ``Much of the rest of the world is in my judgment prepared to go
much further down the road of agricultural trade reform than what
is implied by Mr. MacSharry's proposal,'' he said. ``We have a lot
of negotiating ahead to bridge those gaps.''
   Canada's agriculture minister, Donald Mazankowski, said: ``It's
certainly a welcome step.'' But he added: ``It is very difficult to
determine in fact whether export subsidies will be cut (under the
proposal) at all.''
   Trade negotiations are being held in Geneva under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States and 14 other farm exporting countries want the
12-nation EC to end its export credits system and cut direct
subsidies for farmers, which the critics say distort trade.
   MacSharry said his proposal was serious and balanced but
conceded that ``We have a number of important differences. These
remain to be resolved.''
   Mazankowski told reporters earlier that the United States and
Canada already may have implemented cuts such as those proposed.
   MacSharry's proposed 30 percent cut in farm support extends from
1986 to 1996. It includes already implemented EC reductions of 10
percent in support for crops and 15 percent for livestock.
   A final proposal is to be presented in September to the European
Community, which must approve the plan before it could be tabled at
GATT.
   GATT negotiators are to meet again in Geneva in late August.
They agreed at a meeting last week to compile lists and costs of
their farm support by Oct. 1.
   The agriculture ministers meeting was held at Dromoland Castle
near Shannon in western Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it had
sued a southeast Kansas couple for allegedly spreading rumors _
which it has denied for years _ that the company was associated
with satanism.
   The suit filed late Monday in U.S. District Court, alleges that
James and Linda Newton of Parsons have made libelous and malicious
statements about Procter &amp; Gamble by saying it supports ``the
church of Satan.''
   The couple also allegedly urged people to boycott Procter &amp;
Gamble products.
   A company news release said the Newtons are distributors of
household items for rival Amway Home Products, ``as were several
individuals who previously admitted spreading these lies.''
   ``It appears they are trying to enhance their own business,''
said Topeka attorney Edwin Smith, representing Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The company is seeking more than $50,000 in damages, and is
asking the court to order the Newtons to stop circulating the
stories.
   Mrs. Newton, reached at her home, declined to comment.
   The suit is one of a number the Cincinnati-based company has
filed over the years in an attempt to fight persistent rumors that
its ``moon and stars'' trademark is a satanic symbol.
   The 108-year-old trademark features a man-in-the-moon figure, a
popular design of the 1800s, overlooking a field of 13 stars the
company says are to honor the original American colonies.
   ``We're very proud of our company trademark symbolizing Procter
&amp; Gamble quality and excellence,'' Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a news release.
   ``These lies have persisted now for 10 years, and we will file
further suits if necessary,'' he said.
   The suit alleges that in a circular, the Newtons said the moon
and stars trademark is a satanic symbol. They said the symbol is
actually a ``tiny ram's horn with three sets of stars placed in
such a way that if the stars in each set are joined they form the
number 666, known as the devil's number.''
   ``Christians should always remember that if they buy any product
with this symbol they will be taking part in the support of the
Church of Satan,'' according to the flyer, which was included in
the suit as an exhibit.
   The suit also alleges the Newtons have falsely told people that
senior Procter &amp; Gamble officials have appeared on nationally
televised talk shows acknowledging the company's ties to satanism.
   Over the past three months, the company has received 300 to 350
calls a day asking about the allegations, primarily from
southeastern United States, company officials said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble products include Pampers disposable diapers,
Crest toothpaste, Scope mouthwash, Ivory soap, Tide laundry
detergent, Folgers coffee and Head and Shoulders shampoo.
   In 1985, the company filed lawsuits in Lynchburg, Va., Scranton,
Pa., and Wichita, Kan., against people it accused of spreading
similar rumors associated the company with Satan.
   Procter &amp; Gamble also at the time began phasing out the use of
the trademark on company products, hired private investigators to
probe the spread of the rumors and established a national toll-free
telephone line to handle inquiries.

   Crude oil prices strengthened in moderate
trading Tuesday, while prices for wholesale unleaded gasoline and
heating oil turned mixed.
   Traders said the markets were showing continued confidence the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will stick to last
week's production-curbing accord.
   The cartel's 13 oil ministers, meeting in Geneva, agreed to
raise their minimum reference price to $21 from $18 a barrel _ the
first increase in four years.
   ``There's a lot of nervous energy out there,'' Brian Tagler, an
oil trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said of the reaction
to OPEC's agreement. ``That was one of the most bullish OPEC
meetings.''
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled at $20.69 a 42-gallon barrel
Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 48 cents from
Monday. Other contract months also rose.
   In Monday trading the September contract was up 17 cents.
   WTI had traded as high as $20.77 a barrel Tuesday, but it
couldn't maintain that level after trading was shut down for about
30 minutes due to technical problems with the computerized
price-display system, according to traders.
   Helping strengthen crude prices, Tagler said, was a report of a
500,000-gallon oil spill into Galveston Bay in Texas. The spill
occurred Saturday after a tanker collided with two barges in the
Houston Ship Channel off the bay.
   In addition, Tagler said, the markets reacted bullishly to news
of a threatend strike by oil maintenance workers in the North Sea.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
unleaded gasoline for August delivery settled down 0.28 cent to
65.60 cents a gallon, after gaining a penny on Monday. August home
heating oil, which lost 0.04 cent Monday, gained 0.18 cent to
settle at 57.11 cents a gallon.
   Dealers said trading in oil and gasoline was volatile since both
August contracts were set to expire at the end of Tuesday's session.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract settled at $1.411
per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.430 Monday. Later contracts also
declined.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Surge on Japanese Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices surged more than $10 an ounce Tuesday
amid a bevy of bullish factors, including signs of buying by the
world's biggest platinum jewelry consumers _ the Japanese.
   On other commodity markets, other precious metals were mixed;
energy futures rose; livestock and meat futures advanced; and
grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Trading on New York's five commodity exchanges was halted four
times during the day because of a data transmission problem.
   Trading was halted at the Commodity Exchange, the nation's main
metals market; the New York Mercantile Exchange, the main oil
trading market; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Cotton
Exchange; and the New York Futures Exchange.
   Platinum futures settled $10.80 higher across the board on the
New York Merc with the contract for delivery in October at $485.20
a troy ounce.
   The powerful rally did not extend to gold and silver futures,
which are traded on the Commodity Exchange. Gold settled $2.20 to
$2.60 higher with August at $370 a troy ounce; silver was 1.5 cents
to 1.8 cents lower with August at $4.787 a troy ounce.
   The platinum market opened strongly on indications the Japanese
bought platinum bullion overnight, analysts said.
   Platinum is the jewelry and investment metal of choice in Japan,
making the Japanese key players in the market.
   ``We've seen a bit of lag on their part, but they came back
today,'' said William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch.
   Strength in the oil market further supported the precious
metals, analysts said. The dollar's weakness against other major
currencies also was bullish for the metals, as were reports of
renewed tension between Iraq and Kuwait.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said the potential for violence-related platinum supply disruptions
from South Africa remained a bullish ``underlying factor.''
   Gold rallied strongly at the opening but encountered strong
resistance as the spot delivery price approached $375 an ounce.
Silver futures were depressed by weak demand and plentiful
supplies, analysts said.
   Crude oil for near-term delivery rose strongly on the New York
Merc on reports that Iraq had amassed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's
border.
   Iraq has accused its small Persian Gulf neighbor of stealing oil
from a disputed border region and causing oil prices to drop.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute released a
weekly report that showed far more crude oil on hand than analysts
had expected.
   The API reported a 2.9 million-barrel increase in U.S. crude
stocks last week as opposed to expectations for a 2 million barrel
decline.
   The API said gasoline supplies fell by 720,000 barrels against
expectations for a 1 million barrel increase; distillate stocks
rose 1.5 million barrels, which was near expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 48
cents higher with September at $20.69 a barrel; heating oil was .05
cent to .50 cent higher with August at 57.11 cents gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .28 cent lower to .76 cent higher with August at 65.60
cents a gallon.
   Strong cash markets gave cattle and pork futures a boost on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. All deliveries of frozen pork bellies
rose the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound.
   Live cattle futures ended .35 cent to .75 cent higher with
August at 78.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .65
cent higher with August at 89.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .42
cent to .95 cent higher with August at 61.22 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with August at
51.22 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid continuing signs of strength in the cash market. Wheat and
corn futures fell.
   Wheat futures settled 3{ cents to 6 cents lower with September
at $2.88\ a bushel; corn was unchanged to } cent lower with
September at $2.60\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher
with September at $1.29{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 6{
cents higher with August at $5.94{ a bushel.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar extended its steep descent Tuesday
against major foreign currencies in selling related to a weak U.S.
economic outlook, which is expected to drive down domestic interest
rates.
   It tumbled to a 2{-year low against the German mark in
periodically hectic European trading. The mark has benefitted from
the belief that German unification will foster faster economic
growth there.
   Gold prices gained in world trading.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's decline accelerated when it
slid below thresholds considered technically significant.
   It dropped to 1.5960 marks on the Frankfurt Foreign Exchange.
That was the lowest fixing since Jan. 4, 1988, when the dollar was
officially priced at 1.5816 marks. The dollar's record low at the
Frankfurt fixing had come a few days earlier, on Dec. 31, 1987,
when it was priced at 1.5815 marks.
   On Monday, the U.S. currency was officially priced at 1.6126
marks in Frankfurt.
   The dollar lost more ground in the United States and ended the
day near its lowest levels. It was quoted at 1.58555 German marks
late in New York, down from 1.6040 late Monday.
   Thomas Palladino, a vice president at the Amsterdam Rotterdam
Bank's office in New York, said speculation that the Federal
Reserve will try to revive the flagging American economy by easing
monetary policy has caused investors to dump dollars.
   A decline in U.S. interest rates while foreign rates remain
steady or rise would make returns on dollar-denominated investments
less attractive than foreign alternatives. This would curb demand
for dollars.
   ``The trend for the dollar is still lower,'' Palladino said.
   Evidence of a severe slowdown in U.S. economic statistics due
Wednesday and Friday could further depress the dollar. The U.S.
index of leading economic indicators will be issued Wednesday and
the June employment report is scheduled for release Friday.
   The dollar took a significant dive against the Japanese yen,
falling to 145.835 yen late in New York from 147.83 late Monday.
Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar declined to 147.50 Japanese yen from
148.60. In London late Tuesday, the dollar traded lower at 146.08
yen.
   British sterling continued to climb against the dollar. The
pound rose to $1.8635 late in New York from $1.8465 late Monday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8595 lateTuesday, up from
Monday's late $1.8440 and its best level since Dec. 6, 1988, when
it stood at $1.8675.
   Britain's high 15 percent interest rate to counter inflation is
the underlying reason for the pound's strength.
   Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes, included: 1.34475 Swiss francs, down from 1.3602; 5.3195
French francs, down from 5.3725; 1,162.00 Italian lire, down from
1,174.25; and 1.15165 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15245.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe, compared with late
Monday's levels were: 1.5875 German marks, down from 1.6085; 1.3475
Swiss francs, down from 1.3653; 5.3210 French francs, down from
5.3885; 1.7880 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8125; 1,162.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,177.50; and 1.1530 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1523.
   The dollar's weakness encouraged gold buying.
   Gold for August delivery added $2.20 on the Commodity Exchange
in New York and settled at $370 a troy ounce. Republic National
Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $370.20 for an ounce of gold
bullion, up $2.50.
   In London, the late bid for a troy ounce of gold was $372.05, up
from $367.25. The late bid in Zurich was $371.50, up from $367.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $369.15, up from $367.95.
   Silver for current delivery slipped to $4.787 a troy ounce on
New York's Comex from $4.803 Monday. In London, silver traded late
in London at a bid of $4.85 a troy ounce, up from $4.83.

International Airport with daily roundtrips from Boston.
   The 65-minute flight into the city where Trump owns three
casinos will be offered daily, leaving Boston at 8:10 a.m. and
leaving Atlantic City at 9:20 p.m. One-way fares on the 163-seat

   She said it was too early to speculate if the service to
Atlantic City would be extended to other cities, but added that
company officials are considering Detroit as another possible route.
   Only 523,000 of Atlantic City's 32.1 million visitors come to

   Whirlpool Corp. and Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. said they formed a joint venture
Tuesday to operate Whirlpool's 750-employee vacuum cleaner plant in
Danville, Ky.
   In a signing ceremony at Whirlpool's Benton Harbor headquarters,
the companies finalized a tentative agreement announced June 5 to
form Matsushita Floor Care Co.
   Terms weren't disclosed. In its third-quarter earnings,
Whirlpool will report a gain from sale of an interest in the plant
to Matsushita, and will retain a significant minority interest,
said spokeswoman Carol Sizer.
   Whirlpool manufactures canister, upright and central vacuum
cleaners at the plant under the Kenmore name for Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co., and the venture will continue that business.
   Matsushita imports Panasonic brand vacuum cleaners to the United
States and is expected to use the venture to expand production and
marketing of that brand.
   Matsushita is the world's leading maker of consumer and
industrial electronics products, with production plants and sales
offices in 38 countries and annual sales of nearly $38 billion.
   Whirlpool is the world's leading maker of major home appliances,
manufacturing products in 10 countries and marketing them in more
than 45. Whirlpool had 1989 revenues of $6.29 billion.

   Wall Street turned in its second straight mixed
performance Tuesday as worries about the economy and the planned
employee buyout of UAL Corp. bogged the market down.
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 12.13 at 2,905.20
after fluctuating throughout the session and plunging nearly 39
points in the last half-hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
817 up, 731 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173.81 million
shares, up from 146.47 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 208.11 million shares.
   The market traded in a narrow range for much of the day as many
investors, uneasy about the economy, either stayed on the sidelines
or tread very lightly.
   With several big economic reports due out in the next few days,
the axiom on Wall Street was, ``When in doubt, do nothing,'' said
Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The government was announcing its index of leading economic
indicators on Wednesday, the same day that the National Association
of Purchasing Management was releasing its monthly survey on the
manfacturing economy.
   Uncertainty about the economy contributed to a mixed showing on
Wall Street Monday. The market is still coping with the
government's report last Friday that the gross national product
grew at a paltry 1.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
   There was one particular sore spot throughout Tuesday's trading:
UAL, which had fallen more than 6 points on Monday amid signs that
the planned $4.38 billion employee buyout of the parent of United
Airlines was in trouble.
   The outlook for the deal turned bleaker Tuesday when the trade
publication American Banker said Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp.
representatives did not attend a meeting Friday on possible bank
financing for the deal.
   UAL plunged lower through the day and eventually closed down 16~
at 140.
   But late in the session, UAL's drop set off a wave of
across-the-board selling that took the Dow Jones average to its low
of the day.
   For a while, the market's reaction to UAL resembled Wall
Street's plunge of last Oct. 13, which had been sparked by the
failure of an earlier UAL buyout plan. But the market recovered
Tuesday, and did not even approach the Dow Jones average's
190-point Friday the 13th slide.
   The bright spot of Tuesday's session was the oil sector, which
was sharply higher throughout the day and kept the Dow Jones
average from sinking further. Atlantic Richfield rose 1| to 129&rsqb;,
Exxon picked up 1&lsqb; to close at 51~, and Pennzoil surged 1~ to 83{.
   The energy stocks rose, as they also had done Monday, on
anticipation of higher oil prices. On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the September contract for West Texas Intermediate crude
was up 48 cents to $20.69 a barrel.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $4.159 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.42 to 194.60.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index was up 0.37 to 420.60, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.60 to 356.15.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.14 to 438.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 353.60, down 0.05.

   Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort named
former Resorts International executive I.G. ``Jack'' Davis as
president on Tuesday, the resort's third president since it opened
April 2.
   Davis was named to replace Bucky Howard, who had replaced Walter
Haybert during the Taj Mahal's first week of operations amid
problems with the casino's 3,000 slot machines.
   ``Jack is one of the most experienced operators in this
industry,'' said Ed Tracy, president of Donald Trump's three casino
hotels and one non-casino hotel in Atlantic City. ``His leadership
will prove invaluable.''
   Davis, 65, was the chief executive officer of the neighboring
Resorts International casino while construction developed at the
Taj Mahal, then under Resorts' control. Trump obtained the Taj
Mahal in November 1988 in a swap with entertainer Merv Griffin, who
retained the Resorts International casino.
   ``I'm very happy to be back in Atlantic City,'' Davis said in a
statement. ``The property has always been special to me.''
   Since its April opening, the Taj Mahal has made between $1.1
million and $1.2 million a day in gross gaming revenue. Casino
analysts said the casino needs to make about $1.3 million a day to
meet obligations on the debt used to finance construction of the
casino.
   The casino's performance has taken on increased significance
because of Trump's financial problems. The developer in June
reached a deal with his bank lenders to give up broad control of
his holdings in return for a major debt restructuring to avoid a
possible bankruptcy filing.
   Howard will return to his previous position as executive vice
president of casino operations for Trump Taj Mahal.
   Haybert, after being replaced by Howard, became vice president
of finance for the casino. He had become president last October
after then-president Mark Etess died in a helicopter crash.
   The casino also announced Tuesday the appointment of Howard
Klein as senior vice president of marketing.
   Davis became president of Resorts in 1960 when it was a small
paint company. He saw the company through location of Atlantic
City's first casino in 1978 and through the death of its founder,
James Crosby, in 1986.
   He was fired last September from his $1 million-a-year job as a
consultant to Resorts.
   Resorts now is attempting to reorganize under bankruptcy court
protection from creditors.
   Davis will be the only one of Trump's three casino presidents
who had prior experience in a similar post.
   Trump Plaza president Gary Selesner took that post April 27 from
his executive vice president's job after former president Jack
O'Donnell said he no longer wanted to work for Trump.
   Trump Castle president Anthony Calandra, who replaced Tracy in
that post after Tracy was promoted to head of all Trump's Atlantic
City holdings, was a marketing executive in the Trump Organization
in New York.

   Xerox Corp. reported on Tuesday a 27
percent drop in second-quarter earnings, blaming declines in its
insurance business.
   For the second quarter, after-tax profit totaled $130 million,
or $1.16 per share, compared with $179 million, or $1.67 per share,
a year earlier.
   Revenue edged up about 3 percent to $4.52 billion from $4.38
billion a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue from insurance and other financial
services was $1.2 billion, down 4 percent from $1.3 billion a year
ago.
   Income from document processing, the company's core business,
was $128 million in the second quarter, a 5 percent increase from
the 1989 level of $123 million. Revenue increased 6 percent to $3.3
billion, from $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 1989.
   ``While demand for business equipment remained soft in the
quarter, our revenue growth was supported by strong growth in our
annuity streams from rental, service and financing of equipment
sales,'' said Xerox President Paul A. Allaire.
   For the first six months of the year, Xerox said it lost $124
million, or $1.77 a share, in contrast to a profit of $337 million,
or $3.14 per share, for the same 1989 period.
   The latest results reflected a $375 million after-tax provision
from discontinued operations for a writedown involving its stake in
VMS Realty Partners.
   Revenue in the first half totaled $8.8 billion, up 3 percent
from $8.5 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Congress could avoid voting on a $100 billion
savings and loan bailout for 1991 until next year by passing a
stopgap bill for no more than $10 billion, a Bush administration
official said Monday.
   The proposal, which would postpone action on the larger
appropriation until after the November election, was raised by
Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber.
   He told the House Banking Committee that $5 billion to $10
billion would keep the bailout going through January or February.
He stopped short of endorsing the idea.
   The apparent trial balloon was floated as committee members
noted angry voters are pressuring them to oppose more bailout
funding.
   ``Perception is reality ... and it's the perception on the part
of the American people _ `Give me a break, I'm not paying,''' said
Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
   In another development, lobbyist Robert J. Thompson said he
would refuse to honor a subpoena from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, for testimony before the Senate Judiciary antitrust
committee on Tuesday about his role in arranging the purchase of a
failed S&amp;L by Arizona insurance executive James M. Fail.
   Thompson, a former aide to then-Vice President George Bush, said
in an interview with The Washington Post he arranged meetings for
Fail with Washington officials and was paid his regular fee, won
arrangement of a $150,000 loan and was promised 2 percent of the
profits on the deal.
   Fail's S&amp;L, now the Bluebonnet Bank of Dallas, stands to receive
$1.8 billion in federal subsidies. Fail put up only $1,000 of his
own money.
   According to the interview report in Tuesday editions of the
newspaper, Fail said Metzenbaum's committee was exceeding its
jurisdiction.
   Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., predicted Congress would refuse to go
along with more money for the S&amp;L bailout.
   The administration is not disputing regulators' estimates that
as much as $100 billion in new bailout money is needed for all of
1991.
   Glauber said that under the stopgap plan Congress and the
administration would have to agree to exploit an error in last
year's bailout bill that would allow $18.8 billion more in bailout
borrowing than Congress originally intended.
   The S&amp;L bailout is an important issue in budget summit talks
between the White House and congressional leaders, who are trying
to fashion a package before Congress leaves Washington in October
to campaign.
   The stopgap plan would let Congress and the administration
postpone until next year long-term funding for the Resolution Trust
Corp. (RTC), a year-old agency created to close and sell failed
thrifts, along with a proposal to reform the deposit insurance
system.
   Glauber also repeated two previous alternatives: giving the
administration unlimited authority to spend whatever is needed to
finish the bailout or providing what is needed for 1991.
   RTC Chairman L. William Seidman told the panel his agency would
need to spend $80 billion to $100 billion in fiscal year 1991,
including $30 billion to $40 billion from taxpayers to cover S&amp;L
losses. That's in addition to the $50 billion authorized in the
1989 bailout bill.
   The trust corporation would need to borrow another $50 billion
to $60 billion, which would be repaid as the government sells real
estate and other assets inherited from failed thrifts.
   Another installment on the bailout will be needed in 1992,
Seidman said.
   ``Eighteen months from now, we will have a good hold on the
overall look of things, but this is a moving target,'' he said.
   By the end of September, the RTC will have spent $97 billion _
$37 billion to cover losses and the rest to pay for S&amp;L assets
which will be sold, he said. The agency will need more money early
in the October-December quarter, he said.
   Glauber, in response to a question from Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, the committee chairman, refused to say how much the
administration wanted appropriated for S&amp;Ls in 1991.
   He warned that failure to act could erode depositor confidence
and push up the ultimate cost of the bailout by keeping
money-losing institutions open.
   ``We've got to press this to the end and it's going to cost what
it will cost,'' he said.
   On another subject, Seidman said weak real estate markets, once
a problem only in certain regions such as the Southwest and New
England, have spread to almost every area of the country.
   He said the fund insuring commercial bank deposits was ``under
stress.'' But, he added, ``I do not think it's appropriate to say
there is another S&amp;L debacle ahead for banks.''
   Seidman said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. he also heads
will decide ``in the reasonably near future'' whether to sue Neil
Bush and other officers of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association in Denver.

<HEAD>Computer Giant Buys Technology From Startup Laptop Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it has
agreed to buy technology from Outbound Systems, a small startup
company that has made a Macintosh-compatible laptop computer.
   The agreement allows Outbound Systems, based in Boulder, Colo.,
to offer its products without violating Apple's intellectual
property rights, Apple said. Specific details of the agreement were
not disclosed.
   Apple, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, is
expected to use the technology to produce its own lightweight
portable computer next year, unidentified company sources told the
San Francisco Chronicle.
   Macintosh fans hoped Apple would introduce a laptop last fall
and were disappointed when the company introduced a 16-pound
Macintosh Portable in October. The portable has been one of Apple's
least successful products, and Apple cut the price in May in an
attempt to boost sales.
   Outbound Systems introduced its nine-pound laptop computer in
March despite concerns that Apple might sue the company for
allegedly copying Macintosh technology.
   Outbound Systems began negotiations with Apple in an attempt to
obtain a license to Macintosh technology or agree on a way to alter
its computer system so it would not violate Apple's patents and
copyrights.

<HEAD>Chrysler 2nd Quarter Profits Down 47.2 Percent; Big Three's Off
42.2</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, The figures... to UPDATE with closing stock
price.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s second-quarter earnings dropped
47.2 percent compared with last year as incentives absorbed a huge
chunk of profits, the automaker said Tuesday.
   The results, when combined with earnings reported last Thursday
by General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., showed profits for the
Big Three tumbled 42.2 percent in the April-June quarter this year
compared with the same period last year.
   The figures were generally in line with what Wall Street
analysts had predicted. Chrysler's stock closed unchanged at
$15.12{ a share.
   Chrysler, like GM and Ford, blamed incentive costs during the
quarter for dragging down earnings. The effects of the incentives
were more noticeable at Chrysler than at Ford or GM.
   ``If not for the huge year-to-year increase in per-unit
incentive costs,'' Chairman Lee Iacocca said, ``we would have made
more money this quarter than we did in the second quarter of 1989.''
   Iacocca and analysts said the company's cost-cutting program,
designed to carve $1.5 billion out of $26 billion in annual costs
by the end of this year, contributed to the company's profits.
   Chrysler said it earned $180 million, or 81 cents a share,
during the quarter this year, compared with $341 million, or $1.46
a share, during the same period last year.
   Revenues fell to $8.8 billion from $9.9 billion.
   Chrysler declined to say precisely what its incentive costs
were, but spokesman Tom Houston said they were more than $1,000 per
vehicle during the second quarter.
   Auto analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York
estimated that Chrysler spent about $1,400 on incentives per
vehicle. That's up sharply from his estimate of about $800 per
vehicle during the same period last year.
   Analysts have said and Chrysler has acknowledged that the
company may show a loss in the third quarter as it stops production
at its two minivan plants for retooling for the 1991 model year.
Minivans are among Chrysler's most profitable products.
   Laughlin said Chrysler will increase its cost savings by putting
more efficient manufacturing methods into operation for the '91
models.
   Ford Vice President and Treasurer David McCammon said last week
that his company spent about $1,050 on incentives for each car and
truck sold during the period. GM, like Chrysler, declines to say
how much it spends on incentives.
   Ford said it made $770.7 million in the second quarter, down 45
percent from last year, while GM reported second-quarter earnings
fell 40 percent to $900.1 million.
   GM and Ford also blamed economic instability in Brazil for
cutting their profits, and Ford added that lingering effects of
strikes in the United Kingdom and Belgium further dented earnings.
   The auto industry has been in a slump since the fourth quarter
of last year, when vehicle sales took a dive and inventories of
unsold vehicles rose sharply.
   To get rid of the inventory, automakers boosted their incentive
programs during the first quarter. The tactic worked, but the
companies are finding it tough to wean consumers from the cash-back
or low-interest financing deals.
   For the first half of the year, Chrysler said earnings were down
63.7 percent to $251 million. Ford's first-half earnings were down
56.7 percent to $1.4 billion and GM's were off 46.5 percent to $1.6
billion.
   Combined, the Big Three earned $3.1 billion in the first six
months, down 53.5 percent from last year.

<TEXT>
   The House voted Tuesday to let the government
go $322 billion deeper into debt next year, while White House and
congressional negotiators all but agreed to wait until after the
August congressional recess to finalize a deficit-cutting deal.
   The extension of the government's authority to borrow money _
which should see it through the next year _ came on a 221-205 vote.
If adopted by the Senate and signed into law, the provision would
allow total federal red ink to swell to $3.44 trillion by Sept. 30,
1991.
   Sweetening the measure was an overwhelmingly popular amendment
to stop using the Social Security system's huge surpluses to make
the annual federal deficit look smaller.
   That provision _ approved 413-15 _ would take effect in 1992,
when the program that provides benefits to the elderly and disabled
is expected to run an $88 billion surplus.
   It would not affect next year's federal deficit, now projected
to reach $169 billion, not including the costs of the federal
bailout of the savings and loan industry. If not for the expected
$76 billion surplus Social Security should amass next year, the
1991 budget shortfall would be $245 billion.
   The Social Security measure's sponsor, Rep. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., said the provision would force lawmakers to make ``awful
choices, wrenching choices'' to confront the government's mounting
deficits.
   ``I understand that,'' he said. ``But the choice we've always
made in the last decade is to do nothing.''
   Opponents said the provision would merely complicate the work of
budget summit negotators.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said it dismisses
the budget talks ``a sideshow, something to circumvent, a farce.''
   There is pressure for Congress to approve the debt limit
extension before leaving town for the August recess because the
administration says the government would otherwise run out of cash
by Aug. 15. But the measure's fate in the Senate is uncertain
because several controversial amendments are lurking there.
   One is a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
cut the 6.2 percent payroll tax paid by employees by 1 percentage
point. The measure is popular with many Democrats, but opposed by
many congressional leaders because it would increase the deficit.
   Should the legislation bog down in the Senate, congressional
leaders are prepared to introduce a short-term borrowing measure
that would tide the government over until Congress returns in
September.
   Meanwhile, congressional leaders and White House officials said
they were working toward a schedule to complete a budget pact after
Congress' month-long August recess.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., said they were working toward ``a
mutually agreed-upon timetable.'' An administration official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the two sides could
agree by week's end to a post-recess schedule for votes on a budget
pact.
   Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1. Budget talks, which began 12 weeks
ago, will continue intermittently during the August break,
Democrats have said.
   As the ouse debated the debt limit measure, House and Senate
leaders met again with President Bush to discuss their stalled
budget talks.
   When the session ended, the two sides remained divided in their
search for $50 billion in tax increases and spending cuts for next
year and $500 billion over five years.
   Democrats said they remained willing to begin the August recess
without advancing a deficit-reduction proposal. Republicans renewed
their demand that Democrats produce a budget offer, but House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Bush made no threats.
   ``The mood of these talks is candid, open, very civilized,''
said Foley, D-Wash. ``There are no threatening, angry denunciations
on either side.''
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said ``everyone is
frustrated'' over Democratic refusal to quickly produce a plan.
   Elements of a Bush administration proposal surfaced last week,
including higher alcohol taxes and cuts in the deductibility of
state and local income taxes. Republicans themselves have
criticized those ideas.
   ``It becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate with people
suffering from budgetary schizophrenia,'' said the No. 3 House
Democrat, Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Tuesday approved the $1.25 billion merger of long-distance
telephone companies MCI Communications Corp. and Telecom USA Inc.
   The merger is expected to help MCI make greater inroads into the
long-distance telephone market dominated by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said the company expects the
merger to be completed before the end of August pending state
regulatory approvals.
   MCI announced last April it would acquire all outstanding shares
of Telecom common stock for $42 a share, for a total purchase price
of about $1.25 billion.
   MCI, which has headquarters in Washington, is the nation's
second largest provider of long-distance service. It has 19,500
employees and had revenue in 1989 of $6.5 billion. MCI serves
residential and commercial customers with long distance, voice and
data services in the United States and overseas.
   Telecom USA is the fourth largest U.S. long distance company.
Based in Atlanta, it has 5,000 employees and had 1989 revenue of
$713 million.

   Federal investigators spread blame widely for
the Exxon Valdez oil spill Tuesday, faulting Exxon Corp. for not
providing ``a fit master and a rested and sufficient crew'' and
also blaming the captain, his third mate, the Coast Guard and local
authorities.
   The National Transportation Safety Board voted 4-0 in
determining a five-part probable cause for the nation's worst oil
spill, the dumping of 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's
Prince William Sound by the grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez on
MArch 24, 1989.
   The board said the third mate failed to properly maneuver the
vessel, the alcohol-impaired captain failed to give proper
supervision, Exxon failed to provide a crew up to its task, the
Coast Guard failed in marine traffic control and the state of
Alaska failed to provide adequate piloting rules.
   The board, concluding a 16-month investigation, criticized Exxon
Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood for leaving his third mate, Gregory
Cousins, at the helm before the ship ran aground.
   It also said witnesses, medical tests and an unusual study of
Hazelwood's speech indicated he was drunk when the ship ran
aground, even though an Alaska jury acquitted the captain of being
intoxicated and the Coast Guard dropped a drunkenness charge.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Thomas Russo, who attended the board
meeting, said the board members acted ``like they dropped off the
moon'' in accusing Hazelwood of being drunk. Twenty-one witnesses
testified at his trial that he was sober, Russo said, and
authorities botched blood tests, taken more than 10 hours after the
accident, that showed the presence of alcohol.
   ``Their conclusions are not founded in the evidence,'' Russo
said.
   Hazelwood was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent
discharge of oil. He was fined $50,000 and ordered to spend 1,000
hours cleaning Alaskan beaches. He has appealed.
   Last week, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and
misconduct against Hazelwood but suspended his license as a ship's
master for nine months after he pleaded no contest to breaking
Coast Guard rules.
   The violations included drinking within four hours before taking
command of the vessel and leaving the bridge to the other officer
while the tanker was headed for jagged Bligh Reef, where it split
open.
   Board Chairman James Kolstad said the board hopes its report,
which included 36 safety recommendations, will help prevent future
spills. Its analysis carries no force of law and, by statute,
cannot be used in court cases.
   ``This is the largest and costliest accident the safety board
has ever investigated,'' said Kolstad in opening the meeting. He
said $2 billion had been spent cleaning up the spill.
   The board's conclusions included:
   _The decision by Hazelwood to leave his third mate in charge as
the boat was being maneuvered around a massive ice floe was
improper and against Exxon policies and Coast Guard rules.
   _The third mate was impaired by fatigue, which contributed to
his failure to guide the 987-foot vessel around the ice.
   _Similar conditions of deck officers with inadequate rest exist
on other Exxon tankers due to a company policy of operating with
reduced crews.
   _Exxon offers incentives for crews who work long hours and has
``manipulated'' shipboard reporting of overtime and workload.
   _The Coast Guard has been ``unduly narrow in perspective'' in
allowing Exxon ships to operate with inadequate crews, failing to
consider the amount of work required in loading the ships before
they go out to sea.
   _Exxon has no program for dealing with drug and alcohol abuse.
   _The Coast Guard is not prepared to take tests for drug and
alcohol use after accidents.
   _The Transportation Department's post-accident testing policies
are inadequate.
   _The Coast Guard should have access to national driving records
to help it assess the fitness of ship's officers to hold federal
licenses. Hazelwood had at least two prior convictions for drunken
driving.
   _The Coast Guard should more closely monitor ships and ice
conditions in Prince William Sound, where its traffic service
remains ineffective..
   _Limited supervision of the Coast Guard's vessel traffic system
contributed to the service's lack of knowledge that ice was forcing
ships to move near the reef where the Exxon Valdez hung up.
   Two months after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, the board held a
week-long public hearing in Alaska, interviewing 27 witnesses and
collecting 115 exhibits.
   Since the spill, the tanker has been repaired and renamed the
Exxon Mediterranean and has been undergoing tests for service on
routes in the Mediterranean Sea or the Middle East.

   A federal regulator said Tuesday he would not
have recommended the taxpayer-subsidized sale of 15 Texas savings
and loan associations to an Arizona businessman had he known of the
buyer's guilty plea to a fraud charge.
   ``I would have objected,'' George M. Barclay, president of the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, told a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee. Having no knowledge of the guilty plea by James Fail,
Barclay said, ``I was very comfortable'' with a decision not to
object to Fail's purchase of what now is known as Bluebonnet
Savings Bank.
   The sale of the failing S&amp;Ls is under investigation by the
business rights subcommittee on three grounds:
   _Evidence that Fail put up only $1,000 cash for the 15 banks and
was promised at least $1.85 billion in federal subsidies. Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee, said $3
billion is a better estimate and called the deal scandalous.
   _Fail's plea bargain on one fraud count, which resulted in
dismissal of the indictment, and his guilty plea on behalf of his
United Security Holding Co. to another felony charge.
   _Suspicions by Metzenbaum that a former aide to then-Vice
President Bush improperly intervened with federal officials on
Fail's behalf.
   That aide, Robert J. Thompson, refused to testify before the
subcommittee Tuesday because, his attorney said, the panel has no
jurisdiction over the banking industry and has systematically
handed over Thompson's private documents to reporters.
   The New York Times said in Wednesday editions that documents
made available by the committee showed Thompson was able to review
and suggest modifications to government documents affecting his
clients' interests, in particular helping officials of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board prepare a response to an inspector general's
report that found that Fail should have been precluded from buying
the 15 S&amp;Ls.
   Metzenbaum said the subcommittee will ask the Judiciary
Committee to compel Thompson to comply with a subpoena.
   ``My own view is that we should proceed forthwith with the
strongest means of enforcement'' of the subpoena, said Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa.
   Stanley M. Brand, Thompson's lawyer, told the subcommittee:
``During the Bluebonnet transactions ... my client simply and
forthrightly represented his client, and scrupulously followed the
rules and regulations established by duly authorized federal
regulatory agencies.''
   Thompson said in an interview in The Washington Post on Tuesday
that in exchange for helping Fail, he was paid a lobbying fee,
given a $150,000 loan and promised 2 percent of profits from
Bluebonnet.
   Thompson told the Post he acted as a ``project manager'' helping
Fail work with regulators in Washington, Dallas, Atlanta and New
York.
   M. Danny Wall, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, which approved the Bluebonnet sale, said his records show he
met only three times with Thompson _ never to discuss the takeover.
   Stuart D. Root, who at the time of the sale headed the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., said he would not know Thompson
if he walked into the room.
   Barclay said when the sale was approved in December 1988, he was
aware that Fail and signed a plea bargain that resulted in the
dropping of a 1976 Alabama indictment for securities fraud. Since
that offense had occurred more than 10 years in the past, it was
not considered a bar to the S&amp;L purchase.
   However, Barclay added, ``I do not recall having been told ...
that an affiliate company of Mr. Fail's had pleaded guilty to a
felony,'' which would have been a ``presumptive disqualifier''
against Fail.
   Wall rejected allegations that regulators, in selling the S&amp;Ls
to Fail, turned down a bid that would have been $97 million better
for taxpayers.
   ``That's not true at all,'' Wall said. If the two bids were
compared on the same basis, Fail's would have been at least equal,
and probably better, than the other, he said.
