<HEAD>Chemical Cause of Anti-Social Stench Identified</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research team has tracked down and isolated
the chemical basis for that olfactory offense known in crowded
elevators and packed buses as body odor.
   George Preti, a scientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center
in Philadelphia, said he and his laboratory team for the first time
have identified the natural chemical that gives aromatic fame to
sweaty underarms.
   The chemical, Preti announced Monday at a meeting of the
American Chemical Society, is 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid.
   Researchers at Monell isolated the compound after collecting
sweat from the underarms of a group of male volunteers who wore
pads for 24 hours to absorb the stuff. Preti said the compounds on
the pads then were chemically analyzed.
   ``There were three dozen compounds isolated that can be
odoriferous,'' he said. ``We picked this one because it seemed to
have the most odor, based on seven noses in the laboratory.''
   The compound was then synthesized and vials of the chemical were
left on a bulletin board for the entertainment of passing noses.
Most people agreed, he said, that 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid was the
genuine article _ pure eau de locker room.
   Further testing, said Preti, showed that the compound has some
strange properties.
   Some people, about 5 percent of the population, he said, cannot
even detect the odor. Others say it offends, but only faintly.
   But to people with sensitive noses, such as Preti,
3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid is the odor equivalent of a lightning bolt
striking 20 feet away, followed immediately by thunder.
   He waved a closed test tube of the compound through the air,
made a face and noted, ``I can smell it even when it's covered.''
   Preti said the chemistry that results in body odor starts with
secretions from a gland called the apocrine. This gland is most
common in the armpit, but is also present in the groin and in the
breast.
   ``Its only known purpose is apparently to create scent,'' said
Preti.
   Two types of skin bacteria that live in the armpit feast on the
apocrine secretions and then give out several dozen compounds. One
of them is 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid.
   Preti said studies by dermatologists show that a microorganism
called lipophilic diphtheroids produces ``the strongest and most
pungent odor.''
   About 90 percent of all men have this bacteria in their armpits,
but it is present in only about 67 percent of women, he said. And
women, he said, produce a milder underarm odor.
   Knowing what causes underarm body odor eventually may lead to
new products to help people avoid social offense.
   Preti said fragrance manufacturers are interested in obtaining
the 3-methyl-2-hexenoic formula so they will have a model, or
actual chemical example, of what causes body odor. Using the model,
the companies can test new chemical formulas for deodorant
ingredients that more effectively block the natural aroma of
underarm sweat, he said.
   For those with sensitive noses, said Preti, help is on the way.

   Frank Sinatra says he's no fan of Irish
singer Sinead O'Connor, who refused to perform at a New Jersey
concert if the national anthem was played.
   ``She should leave the country. Her behavior is unforgivable.
For her sake, we'd better never meet,'' Sinatra told his audience
Saturday night at the Garden State Arts Center.
   The Hoboken native's remarks drew thunderous applause.
   O'Connor, best known for her hit ``Nothing Compares 2 U'' and
her nearly shaved head, threatened on Friday to walk out on an
audience of 9,000 if ``The Star Spangled Banner'' was played at the
center, as it is before every show. Fearing trouble if the concert
didn't go on, the center's staff relented.
   But O'Connor won't be allowed back, said center official George
Zilocchi.
   ``No performer who does not agree to have the national anthem
played will be allowed to perform,'' he said.
   O'Connor said she opposed the playing of any national anthem
before her concerts. ``I don't see what (anthems) have to do with
me or my music or my fans,'' she said.

   Master chef Wolfgang Puck and
several colleagues plan to join actor Vincent Price in the ``Old
West'' next month to raise money for Meals on Wheels.
   The Sept. 15 benefit on Universal Studio's Western set is
expected to draw more than 1,000 guests, each donating at least
$175 for a chance to taste food created by Puck, Alice Waters, Mark
Miller, Anne Rosenzweig and others.
   Organizers hope the event will raise $350,000.
   The eighth annual American Wine &amp; Food Festival will benefit the
Los Angeles chapter of Meals on Wheels, which delivers hot meals to
homebound elderly.
   Contributions are expected to cover the cost of at least 175,000
delivered meals.

   The raunchy rap group 2 Live Crew says
$13,867.56 is all it owes for an unauthorized parody of Roy
Orbison's ``Oh, Pretty Woman.''
   But attorneys for Acuff-Rose, the music company that holds the
rights to the 1964 hit, told a federal court they weren't satisfied
with the offer.
   The Nashville publishing house, an arm of Opryland USA, sued 2
Live Crew on June 18, claiming the rap song ``Pretty Woman'' on the
group's ``As Clean As They Wanna Be'' album amounted to copyright
infringement.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Wiseman on Friday ordered the money
deposited into an interest-bearing account until the lawsuit is
settled.
   Members of the group were arrested on obscenity charges in June
after performing songs from their album ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be'' in Hollywood, Fla.

<HEAD>Souter Cannot Be Confirmed Before Start of Supreme Court Term</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter cannot
be confirmed by the Oct. 1 start of the court's 1990-91 term even
if he sails through his Senate confirmation hearings, sources say.
   That means the high court will start a new term one justice shy
for just the third time in the last 20 years.
   ``It's a matter of timing,'' said a Senate Judiciary Committee
aide who requested anonymity. The aide added the earliest committee
vote on Souter's nomination would be Sept. 27, two weeks after the
Sept. 13 start of his confirmation hearings.
   If all goes smoothly for the federal appeals court judge from
New Hampshire, his nomination likely will reach the full Senate the
week of Oct. 1 or Oct. 8.
   Diana Huffman, the committee's staff director, rebuffed
questions about the timing of any committee vote. ``I'm just not
going to speculate on it at all,'' she said.
   But other committee aides, both Democrats and Republicans, said
no committee vote on Souter is likely before Sept. 27 even if his
hearings before the Judiciary Committee last only three days.
   President Bush nominated Souter to replace Justice William J.
Brennan, 84, who retired in July for health reasons.
   At the Supreme Court, plans for a Sept. 25 swearing-in ceremony
for Souter have been quietly shelved.
   If Souter is confirmed, his late arrival would not necessarily
hamstring the court. He would have the option of reading legal
briefs and listening to tape recordings of oral arguments in the
cases already heard by the justices.
   There are historic precedents.
   More than a year passed before Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined
the court in 1970 to fill the vacancy created by Abe Fortas'
resignation. In the interim, the Senate rejected President Nixon's
nominations of Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take his seat until February
1988 in replacing Lewis F. Powell, who had retired the previous
June. The Senate had defeated President Reagan's nomination of
Robert H. Bork, and a second nominee, Douglas H. Ginsburg, withdrew
after news reports of his past marijuana use.

<HEAD>Tight Budget Must Not Slow Drug War, Bennett Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war on drugs must not be sidetracked by
other budget priorities, say national drug policy director William
Bennett and top prosecutors from several states.
   ``We cannot be diverted from this,'' Bennett said Monday after
meeting with members of the National Association of Attorneys
General criminal law committee.
   ``This should not be viewed as a temporary or six-month or
year-long enthusiasm on the part of the Congress,'' Bennett said.
``They have made the case to their constituents. They've made the
case to me at I don't know how many hearings that this is an issue
of fundamental national priority.''
   He said he will fight for the drug war budgets he has submitted
``and we will keep their attention on this issue whether they want
to keep attention on it or not.''
   The House Appropriations Committee recently cut $231 million
from Bennett's proposed $252 million increase in funding for drug
treatment and education. The money was restored on the House floor
after Bennett blasted the committee in numerous media interviews.
   Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said he believed it was
realistic to expect the drug war to get more money despite the
budget crunch.
   ``I don't think we can afford not to,'' said Moore, chairman of
the attorneys generals' criminal law committee. ``We've got kids
being shot in schools nowadays. We didn't have that when I was
growing up.
   ``I just had a 13-year-old girl beaten to death over crack
cocaine in my hometown in Jackson, Miss. We didn't have that when I
was growing up. Yeah, I think it's a priority and I think it's
saving lives,'' Moore said.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Shannon added, ``This
has to be a sustained effort.'' If budget problems result in
inadequate funding, ``then all of this talk about a war against
drugs for the last year has just been hot air.''
   Bennett and the prosecutors also urged the country not to forget
about the war on drugs as it focuses on hostilities in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We are here partly to remind you that this effort goes on and
that this represents something every bit as important as what is
going on anywhere else in the world,'' Bennett said.
   ``It is possible for a great nation to take care of its own kids
and its own principles in more than one place at one time,'' he
said.
   Said Pennsylvania Attorney General Ernest D. Preate Jr.: ``We
can do two things at once. We can help our boys overseas and we can
fight the drug pushers here at home.''
   The committee's recommendations to Bennett for the updated drug
strategy due in early 1991 included:
   _Encouraging increased funding for multi-jurisdictional task
forces, both those involving federal agents and local forces
consisting of city, county and state officials.
   _Urging states with grand jury charging requirements to enact
legislation creating state grand juries and encourage spending
federal funds to create and operate such state grand juries.
   _Using asset forfeiture provisions and civil racketeering
statutes more often in pursuit of drug traffickers.
   Bennett said the attorneys general also urged that states be
required to have comprehensive drug strategies to receive federal
funds. However, Preate said they did not go that far and only
encouraged states to develop such plans.
   Also attending the meeting were attorneys general Robert T.
Stephan of Kansas, Robert Del Tufo of New Jersey, Don Hanaway of
Wisconsin and Robert Butterworth of Florida.

<HEAD>Farm Family Income Reaches That of City Dwellers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says farm families
have finally caught up with their city cousins in terms of annual
income.
   ``As a group, farm operator households have entered the U.S.
mainstream,'' says a report by the department's Economic Research
Service. ``They no longer have low income relative to non-farm
households.''
   There are lots of reasons for the catchup, including a decline
in farm families over many years, outside jobs and other factors.
   One of the underpinnings of support in Congress for expensive
farm programs has been the traditional income gap between rural and
urban people.
   ``Back in the 1930s, when farm commodity programs were
initiated, average farm family income was about half of that of all
U.S. families,'' the report said. ``By the late 1950s, the share
was still only about 60 percent.''
   Today, however, farm household income _ the total for all family
members _ is on a par with non-farm people.
   ``This challenges the popular view that farm commodity programs
now assist a relatively disadvantaged group,'' the report said.
   ``Some farm families continue to have serious income problems,''
it added. ``But the drop in farm numbers and rise in average income
mean that these problems are not as pervasive as they once were.''
   The report is in the September issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine. Overall, it said, farm poverty rates today are low by
historical standards and represent a small part of the U.S. poverty
population.
   ``This contrasts sharply with 1959-60, the first years for which
poverty data were calculated, when over half of the U.S. farm
population was poor, and one if five poor people lived on a farm,''
the report said.
   Economist Ken Deavers, one of the report's authors, said Monday
in a telephone interview that the slide in the nation's farm
population has been an important factor.
   As the number of families declined, those that were left often
expanded holdings and boosted production.
   In 1950, for example, there were about 5.86 million farms in the
United States. By 1959, those had shrunk to just over 3.7 million.
Today, USDA estimates there are about 2.14 million farms.
   ``You couldn't have had the rise in household incomes and have
had as many people stay in the (farm) sector as were there
originally,'' Deavers said. ``It's a combination of improved
technology, better organization, better marketing ... a whole bunch
of things.''
   But one of the important messages has been that the original
``very high rates of poverty among farm households aren't there any
more,'' he said.
   Off-farm income from jobs ``has been critical'' to the
improvement in farm family incomes over the years, Deavers and
colleague Tom Carlin said in their report. Non-farm investments
also have helped.
   ``One recent study shows that about half of all farm households
depend primarily on off-farm income for family living,'' the report
said. ``Nine out of 10 of these households operate farms with
annual sales of less than $40,000.''
   These are small farms whose annual sales of crops and livestock
total less than $40,000 a year, generally considered insufficient
by itself to support a household.
   ``For 45 percent of all U.S. farm operators, farming is a second
job,'' the report said. ``Many are machinists, manufacturing
production workers, or lawyers first and farmers second.''
   Thus, it added, a growth in job opportunities has helped boost
the incomes of farm families ``perhaps more so than commodity
programs. This is important because only about one in three farms
participate in commodity programs.''

   Last year's drop in U.S. milk production
helped trigger higher prices all along the marketing pipeline, says
an Agriculture Department report.
   ``The price increase were generated mainly by a declining milk
supply, strong domestic cheese demand and heavy non-fat dry milk
exports,'' the department's Economic Research Service said Monday.
   Dairy farmers failed to boost 1989 production to a record level
as feed prices increased and supplies of drought-reduced 1988
forage were exhausted.
   ``Output per cow fell below a year earlier by mid-1989,'' the
agency said in a preliminary report. ``Production declined
substantially in the large milk-producing regions _ the (Great)
Lake states and Northeast _ where forage problems were most
pronounced.''
   At the same time, large export commitments for non-fat dry milk,
along with strong domestic demand and low commercial cheese
inventories, made the dairy industry vulnerable to declines in milk
production.
   Retail prices of milk and other dairy products as a group
climbed an average of 6.6 percent in 1989, compared with a 2.4
percent gain in 1988, according to USDA figures.
   Milk production last year dropped about 1 percent to 144.3
billion pounds from the record level of 145.2 billion pounds in
1988.
   This year, according to recent agency projections, milk
production may climb to another record level of around 147.7
billion pounds and could go to 149.6 billion pounds in 1991.

   Day after day, in baking afternoon heat
and by the light of cooking fires, refugees from Kuwait and Iraq
huddle miserably in national groups at this chaotic border crossing.
   At a rate of about 20,000 a day, they stream across the desert
from Iraq with bulging fiber suitcases and shapeless bundles of
possessions, in most instances the last remains of years of work in
the occupied oil-rich emirate.
   ``This is all,'' said Miralam Bashir Mihmir, a Bangladeshi
laborer, spreading his hands to take in his cotton shift and
sandals. He abandoned eight years of savings.
   Like his friends, he had little idea how he would get back home,
let alone find work, but he had had enough of Kuwait.
   ``Too much fighting,'' he said.
   Among a wealthier Indian contingent, five engineers interrupted
one another to describe their hardships.
   ``But really,'' concluded one, ``Indians probably suffered the
least.''
   An estimated 235,000 people have crossed at Ruweishid since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Less than 100,000 have left for their
homelands.
   Egyptians are by far the most numerous, from destitute clusters
of hungry families to a lone bachelor in an elegant black
trenchcoat overseeing a tidy mound of cases and sacks.
   But many other countries are represented.
   Early Monday, Chinese stood in stoic formation, their bundles
slung coolie-fashion on wooden poles. A van festooned with a
Malaysian flag finally pulled onto the road.
   Yugoslavs jostled with Thais to get close enough to the harried
immigration officer who stood on a bench in the doorway and droned
out names like a cattle auctioneer.
   A few managed to scramble past the officer's legs to get inside
for attention. But no one manned the counters.
   Officers pawed among towers of passports, shouting to be heard
while puffing cigarettes whose smoke obscured the ``no smoking''
signs.
   ``Like vegetables,'' wailed a distraught Indian salesman,
imploring a visiting reporter to alert his embassy. ``They treat
our passports like vegetables in a market. They just let them lie
there.''
   Uncounted thousands slept among their belongings, amid rising
heaps of garbage.
   Women struggled to comfort screaming infants.
   Toilet facilities designed for perhaps 50 visitors a day were
quickly overwhelmed. Health workers doused the open ground with
disinfectant, but made only a dent in the stench.
   Most refugees spend two days on the road from Kuwait, through
Baghdad. At the Jordanian border, clearance takes anything from a
few hours to three days. And then the odyssey starts again.
   Egyptians and Sudanese go to the Red Sea Port of Aqaba to wait
for a backed-up airlift or ferryboat home. The others load back
into groaning buses to drive on to Amman, 150 miles to the
southwest.
   In Amman, 35,000 people are camped amid squalor at two auto
exhibition halls. Others crowd into mosques. At one center, 5,000
people lie side-by-side on the floor, sharing five toilets. The
rest sleep in the open.
   Jordanian officials reported at least four children have died of
digestive disorders since the refugee tide began in earnest Aug. 8.
Three adults succumbed to illness at Ruweishid.
   In the same period, three new babies were born.
   ``We're not exactly sure of figures,'' said Dr. Ahmed Dagens, at
the Jordanian Red Crescent first aid station at the border. ``There
was such chaos at first, we had trouble keeping track.''
   Now, said Dagens, doctors treat refugees for headaches and other
effects of the heat that hits 110 degrees as well as stomach
problems from bad food, but few serious ailments.
   The Jordanian army set up a 30-bed field hospital to support the
civilian hospital at Ruweishid, but neither is full.
   Two Swiss nurses from the International Committee of the Red
Cross make regular rounds but find little to do. Most problems
appear to be psychological rather than medical.
   Volunteer workers report serious depression among some laborers
who, forced to leave everything behind in Kuwait, are headed home
to unemployment and hungry families.
   At Ruweishid, refugees seemed less disturbed by the conditions
than relieved to be out of Iraq.
   Daniel Frieneza decided to go back to Quezon City, in the
Philippines, when an artillery shell blew a hole in his apartment
last week.
   ``Every night there's an exchange of gunfire, Kuwaitis making
hit-and-run attacks,'' said Frieneza, an audio-video technician who
is now penniless and looking for work.
   But, he said, at least he has something to wear. A friend lent
him a T-shirt reading: ``California. Life is a Beach.''

<HEAD>Group Organizes Letter-Writing Campaign for Troops in Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans are being encouraged to write
letters to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region in a new campaign
organized by the group No Greater Love.
   The campaign, called Operation Brave Heart, is designed to offer
emotional support to military men and women in the gulf and to
boost their morale, the group said Monday.
   Separately, US Sprint Communications Corp. said it is offering
U.S. military personnel in the gulf free calls home in the event
they are wounded, expecting the birth of a child, or facing other
emergency situations. The calls would be relayed by shortwave radio
to ham radio operators in the United States and from there into US
Sprint's telephone network, said company spokesman Jim Crawford in
Washington.
   The Postal Service announced last week that only letters
weighing 12 ounces or less could be sent through APO or FPO
addresses to personnel involved in Operation Desert Shield.
Packages will be returned to sender because the Defense Department
is putting priority on military cargo shipments, officials said.
   No Greater Love, a non-political support group for families of
U.S. hostages and other victims of terrorism, invited Americans of
all ages to participate in the letter-writing campaign.
   ``Operation Brave Heart is a response to the requests of many
people wanting to find a way to show our troops in Operation Desert
Shield that Americans care about them and pray that peace will come
through their presence and they will soon return to their loved
ones,'' said Carmella LaSpada, chairman of No Greater Love.
   The campaign also is open to people of other countries who have
sent their own troops to the gulf, the group said.
   It said the salutation for the letters should be: Dear ``Brave
Heart''. Letters sent to the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps in
Saudi Arabia should be addressed: Operation Brave Heart, c-o
Operation Desert Shield, APO New York 09848-0006.
   Letters sent to the Navy and Marine Corps on board ships in the
Gulf region should be addressed: Operation Brave Heart, c-o
Operation Desert Shield, FPO New York 09866-0006.

   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee advises against an American attack to liberate Kuwait,
arguing that U.S. forces should be committed to a ground war there
only as a last resort.
   ``It would be a very bloody event and we would lose a lot of
people, even though in the long run I think we'd prevail,'' Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Monday in a telephone interview from Saudi
Arabia. ``I don't want to see that happen.''
   Nunn, part of a Senate delegation that met with U.S. commanders
and soldiers in Saudi Arabia, said economic sanctions already in
place against Iraq should be given a chance to work. He said the
international community should use the embargo to ``tighten the
screws'' on Iraq.
   ``I think it's important for us to have some patience,'' he
said. ``It's worth having patience to avoid the loss of American
life.''
   Nunn said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would be committing
``an act of supreme folly'' if he attacked Saudi Arabia now. But it
that happened, he said, the United States should launch air strikes
against Iraq.
   ``We have an Air Force in place that could cause tremendous
damage to Iraq,'' Nunn said. ``In my opinion, there should be no
sanctuaries if he attacks.''
   The Senate delegation, headed by Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, had planned the trip to the Middle East before Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2. Dole invited Nunn to join the group last weekend
when Saudi Arabia was added to the itinerary.
   The senators planned to travel to Egypt today for a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak. Nunn said the group would encourage
Mubarak to increase his country's commitment to the Saudi defense
buildup.
   ``It's very important to get heavy forces in there and I think
the preferable country for that is Egypt,'' he said.
   While the presence of Egyptian heavy forces in Saudi Arabia
would be important militarily, Nunn said it would be even more
important psychologically for Arab forces to be in the forefront of
the battle against Saddam.

   Many prominent musicians have met early deaths in air accidents.
Here is a list:
   Aug. 27, 1990, Grammy-winning blues guitarist Stevie Ray
Vaughan, 35, was killed when a helicopter crashed into a hill in
East Troy, Wis., after departing from a concert. Vaughan had a
platinum album with his band Double Trouble in ``Couldn't Stand the
Weather,'' released in 1984. That year, he won a Grammy Award for
best traditional blues recording for a song called ``Flood Down in
Texas.'' This year, he won a Grammy in the contemporary blues
category for ``In Step.''
   Dec. 31, 1985, Rick Nelson died in a New Year's Eve plane crash
near De Kalb, Texas. Nelson, 45, achieved rock 'n' roll stardom in
the late 1950s and early '60s with hits like ``I'm Walkin,''' and
``Travelin' Man.'' He was featured, along with the rest of his
family, on the long-running TV series ``The Adventures of Ozzie and
Harriet.''
   March 19, 1982: Randy Rhoads, lead guitarist for heavy metal
star Ozzy Osbourne, was killed when the plane in which he was
flying buzzed Osbourne's tour bus and crashed into a house in
Leesburg, Fla. He was 25. Rhoads won a Guitar Player magazine award
for Best New Talent of 1981.
   Oct. 21, 1977: Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant and guitarist Stevie
Gaines of the Lynyrd Skynyrd band, which carved a niche in the rock
world with its image as hard- drinking, hell-raising Southerners,
were killed in a plane crash in McComb, Miss.
   Sept. 20, 1973: Jim Croce died in an air crash near
Natchitoches, La., at age 30. He put together a string of rock hits
such as ``Time in a Bottle'' in the 1970s.
   Dec. 10, 1967, rhythm and blues artist Otis Redding died in a
plane crash in Wisconsin along with members of his band, the
Bar-Kays. He was 26. His greatest hit ``Sittin' on the Dock of The
Bay'' was released just three days before the crash.
   July 31, 1964, country music singer Jim Reeves, known for hits
like ``Welcome to My World'' and ``He'll Have to Go,'' died at age
39 in a light plane crash near Nashville along with his manager,
Dean Manuel, 30.
   March 5, 1963: Patsy Cline, whose country hits included
``Crazy'' and ``She's Got You,'' died in a plane crash near Camden,
Tenn., at age 31. Also killed were Grand Ole Opry stars Cowboy
Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins and pilot Randy Hughes, Miss Cline's
manager.
   Feb. 3, 1959: A plane carrying singers J.P (The Big Bopper)
Richardson, Buddy Holly and Richie Valens crashed near Mason City,
Iowa, en route to a show in Fargo, N.D. The Big Bopper, whose big
hit was ``Chantilly Lace'' in 1958, was 29. Holly, whose hits
included ``Peggy Sue,'' was 22. Valens, famous for songs like ``La
Bamba'' and ``Donna,'' was 18.
   Dec. 15, 1944, big band leader Glenn Miller was in a plane
flying over the English Channel en route from Bedford, England, to
Paris where he was to give a show. The plane never arrived. Two
members of the British Royal Air Force said the musician's plane
might have been hit by bombs jettisoned over the English Channel by
RAF bombers.

   California keeps adding to a population that
is already the nation's largest, now topping 29 million people,
according to a new census report.
   California grew more than 23 percent during the 1980s, to
29,279,015 people, the Census Bureau said Monday.
   Florida, meanwhile, shows 12,774,603 residents in the
preliminary count of the 1990 census. That's up from 9.7 million a
decade ago.
   Neighboring Georgia, which had 5.4 million in 1980, has
increased to nearly 6.4 million, the report said.
   The two were among six states receiving preliminary population
reports Monday. So far 46 states have received these reports with
the balance expected over the next week or so.
   Census officials stressed that the reports are preliminary. They
are designed to give local officials a chance to raise questions if
they find areas where they believe people have been missed or
overcounted.
   The final, official, census counts are scheduled for release on
Dec. 31.
   Preliminary reports from all of the states are expected to be
completed in the next week or two.
   Newly released state counts, and the census count in 1980:
   Alabama, 3,984,384, up from 3,894,000.
   California, 29,279,015, up from 23,668,000.
   Florida, 12,774,603, up from 9,746,000.
   Georgia, 6,386,948, up from 5,463,000.
   Indiana, 5,498,725, up from 5,490,000.
   Massachusetts, 5,928,331, up from 5,737,000.

<HEAD>NEA Gives Reason for Veto of Four Controversial Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts says
grants for four avant-garde theater performers were vetoed because
agency Chairman John E. Frohnmayer decided their work would not
``enhance public understanding and appreciation of the arts.''
   The four performers, Karen Finley and Holly Hughes of New York
and Tim Miller and John Fleck of Los Angeles, who appealed
Frohnmayer's decision, were told Friday that their appeals had been
denied.
   The NEA confirmed the action in a statement Monday.
   When Frohnmayer vetoed the four grants on June 29, he refused to
give any reasons, citing a longstanding endowment policy against
discussing grant rejections. The NEA statement Monday represented
an unusual departure from that policy in a case that has attracted
widespread publicity.
   Public performances by the four, each of whom had received NEA
grants in the past, involve monologues and other stage routines
that generally deal with politics, racism and sexual oppression and
frequently include strong sexual content.
   The performers have been singled out by conservative members of
Congress as examples of the NEA's willingness to subsidize works
that might be offensive.
   Federal grants for the four performers were approved last spring
by an NEA ``peer review'' panel of artists, but Frohnmayer took the
rare step of overruling the panel's recommendations.
   He acted after a majority of the endowment's presidentially
appointed advisory body, the National Council on the Arts, urged
him to veto the four grants because they ``were not appropriate for
federal support,'' the NEA statement said.
   ``The arts endowment is charged by Congress with determining,
among other criteria, whether a work will enhance public
understanding and appreciation of the arts,'' the statement said.
``The chairman, deciding that these would not, accepted the
council's recommendation.''
   Lawyers for the four rejected grantees announced Friday they
will sue the NEA in federal court, charging that Frohnmayer's
decision was based on political rather than aesthetic grounds and
that it violated their free-speech rights under the First Amendment.
   The Rutherford Institute in Charlottesville, Va., a non-profit
legal services organization specializing in First Amendment and
religious freedom cases, said it will file a lawsuit against the
arts endowment in U.S. District Court in Washington on Wednesday.
The institute refused to discuss details of its suit in advance.
   The NEA already is the target of separate federal lawsuits in
New York and Los Angeles challenging Frohnmayer's requirement that
grant recipients sign an anti-obscenity pledge as a condition for
receiving federal funds.

   Verbal scores on the SAT have dropped to their
lowest level in a decade, and a testing official says that's
because too many students are watching music videos and playing
video games instead of reading.
   Combined Scholastic Aptitude Test scores totaled 900 for the
1989-90 school year _ 476 on the math section, 424 on the verbal,
the College Board reported Monday. The highest possible score is
800 on each section, for a combined 1,600.
   Math scores were unchanged among the 1.03 million high school
students who took the test. But the verbal average was down three
points from the previous school year, marking a steady decline
since the recent peak of 431 in 1986.
   Verbal scores are now at their lowest point since 1980 and equal
to the worst levels since national averages were first compiled in
1971.
   ``Students must pay less attention to video games and music
videos and begin to read more,'' said College Board president
Donald M. Stewart.
   Reading could become a ``lost art'' unless parents and schools
make it a priority, he said in an interview.
   Each section of the multiple-choice SAT is scored on a scale of
200-800. The predominant college entrance exam in 22 states, it is
sponsored by the board and administered by the Educational Testing
Service in Princeton, N.J.
   The annual SAT averages have become a widely cited indicator of
how schools are doing, but education experts say it is probably too
soon for the SATs to reveal the progress of widespread school
reforms enacted in the mid-1980s.
   Most children affected by the reforms are still years away from
the SAT, which is usually taken during the junior year of high
school.
   In addition, federal programs such as Head Start and Chapter I,
which in the 1960s and 1970s tried to boost achievement among the
poor and minorities, took years to pay off in higher SAT scores.
   Those programs are credited with steady SAT gains by virtually
every minority group. Most notably, last year's average scores
among American Indians rose a combined 13 points, to 388 verbal and
437 math.
   Verbal scores among blacks rose one point to 352 and now stand
20 points higher than 1976 levels. Math averages were down one
point to 385 but are still 31 points better than 1976 scores.
   Some critics question the ability of a single statistic like the
SATs to summarize accurately the performance of 40 million students
attending kindergarten through 12th grade in 83,000 schools in
15,000 school districts.
   The board claims it's a good predictor of success in the college
freshman year. But critics such as FairTest in Cambridge, Mass.,
insist the SAT favors whites, males, the wealthy and those adept at
standardized test-taking.
   Statistics seem to bear out the wealth claim. Test-takers last
year from 151,485 families earning $70,000 or more averaged 468
verbal, 527 math. The 41,845 test-takers from families earning less
than $10,000 averaged 357 verbal, 419 math.

<HEAD>Electronic Diplomacy Emerges in the Television Age</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomacy played out through the media is not
new. What's new is the speed by which it happens, live by satellite.
   When President Bush speaks in Kennebunkport, Maine, presumably
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is listening 6,000 miles away in
Baghdad _ and vice versa.
   Diplomacy ``used to be by cable, and now it's by satellite,''
said Steve Friedman, executive producer of NBC's ``Nightly News.''
   ``I think it's fraught with danger, in terms of television's
`live' incapacity to really interpret some of these events,'' said
Reid Collins, CNN anchorman in Washington.
   ``The problem is that communication is instant, reaction is
instant, and everybody needs to just slow down,'' said anchorman
Jim Lehrer of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour'' on the Public
Broadcasting Service.
   Diplomacy by television was born in the Middle East when the
1967 Arab-Israeli war divided the principals behind battle lines.
   ``When you are unable to have diplomatic contact, the reporter
is the one who is able to get the message,'' said Barbara Walters,
who covered the Middle East for ABC in the '70s.
   ``I would go and interview (Egyptian President) Anwar Sadat,
then I would have to go to Israel by way of Cyprus, because the two
countries had no direct links and were technically at war, and I
would talk with Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin'' of Israel, she
said.
   ``I remember the feeling of responsibility, and I would think
how ironic and how sad it was that a reporter was going around
delivering messages between people who could not speak.''
   The role of television and the TV journalist as mediator reached
its high point in 1977, when CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite
simultaneously interviewed Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin.
   On the ``neutral ground'' of television, Cronkite asked Sadat if
he would visit Israel. Yes, Sadat would go to Israel. Would Sadat
be welcome in Jerusalem, Cronkite asked. Yes, was the answer.
   The next day, Israel's invitation arrived in Cairo. It was,
CNN's Collins said, ``the genesis of the Camp David accords'' and
Egyptian-Israeli peace.
   ``Wire services and newspapers have been doing this for a long
time, probably more than a century,'' said Robert MacNeil,
co-anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.'' ``It's just that
television has speeded it up.''
   Satellite diplomacy was an occasional phenomenon before the
creation of ``Nightline'' during the Iran hostage crisis, said ABC
News vice president Richard C. Wald. ``Then it became almost
institutionalized,'' he said.
   American television created a dialogue for South Africans in
their country in a 1985 broadcast, Wald said. A representative of
the ruling white minority debated with a member of the
unrepresented black majority.
   ``They were engaging in a debate on the air _ not face-to-face,
but electronically _ for the first time ever. And it was viewed in
South Africa,'' Wald said.
   TV diplomacy can hinder the understanding of events, Collins
said. And television's desire to know the end of the story and to
summarize events that most often defy summarization can be
dangerous, he said.
   ``If every man and woman in television who did a standup left
off the last line, the world would be much better served,'' Collins
said.
   ``This is not a television show. ... This is a real-world
confrontation,'' said Lehrer.
   But Wald said satellite diplomacy may function as a safety valve.
   ``Clearly you could misspeak. But you can misspeak anywhere.
Clearly you could give the wrong signal. But you could give the
wrong signal anywhere,'' he said. ``To talk is better than not to
talk. Quoting Winston Churchill, `Jaw, jaw is better than war,
war.' ''

   That means Cubans who get up early enough to watch the pre-dawn
programming and whose television reception escapes Cuban jamming
efforts will be able to watch the news, movies and shows such as
``Cheers'' and ``Mission Impossible.''
   Bush's announcement Monday releases $16 million that had been

was both legal and technically feasible.
   The station, called TV Marti, has been broadcasting news and
entertainment shows on a trial basis since March 27. Cuba has

<HEAD>1,400 Sunbeam Mixers Recalled Because of Electric Shock Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunbeam Appliance Co. of Milwaukee is
recalling 1,400 mixers found to have a risk of severe electric
shock.
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that the
counter-top mixers can cause severe shock if motors and other
electrical components shift through shipping or handling and come
in contact with the chrome-plated housing.
   There have been no reports of consumers being injured, the
commission said.
   Sunbeam spokesman Wayne Smith said the defect was discovered
through rough handling tests at the factory and voluntarily
reported to the government.
   The affected models were distributed from February through April
this year and have the model numbers 01930 and 01940. The two
models had suggested retail prices of $165 to $185.
   The company, a subsidiary of Oster-Sunbeam Appliance, has set up
a toll-free telephone number (1-800-441-7068) to help consumers
determine if their mixers should be returned. Replacement mixers
will be provided free of charge, the company said.

<HEAD>Student Don't Like Education, So They Don't Pay $2 Billion</HEAD>

   The government estimates that defaults on
student loans will cost taxpayers nearly $2 billion this year, and
a major reasons given by people who welsh on debt is that they are
out of work.
   Many said they simply didn't like the education they got, the
Education Department said Monday.
   ``Unemployed and without income'' was cited more than any other
reason, slightly ahead of ``working, but insufficient funds,'' the
department said in an 80-page booklet called ``Reducing Student
Loan Defaults: A plan for action.''
   ``Behind the default statistics are students who are either
unable or unwilling to repay their loans,'' says Education
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos in the introduction.
   ``Many of the defaults could have been prevented if everyone
involved in student loans _ students, post-secondary institutions,
lenders, guarantee agencies and the federal and state governments _
had worked together,'' the report says.

   A manufacturer's announcement that it was
recalling one of its coffee makers has tied up a toll-free number
with a flood of calls and brought some consumers to a fast boil.
   ``We know there is a large volume of calls we're missing,'' said
Jerry Ray, spokesman for Proctor-Silex Co. of Richmond, Va.
   Ray said the company processed 75,000 calls in the first four
days after it pledged to provide free coffee makers to an estimated
800,000 consumers who purchased a model now declared a fire hazard.
   Proctor-Silex said the coffee makers are subject to potentially
dangerous overheating because their thermostats and thermal fuses
may malfunction.
   Consumers have complained to news organizations that they spent
hours unsuccessfully trying to get through to the toll free number,
or that they were connected to the wrong number.
   Ray said the company has 200 trained phone operators answering
queries 24 hours a day. He urged people to call at night when the
line is not so busy, and to keep trying.
   Ray, however, said telephone company officials have assured
Proctor-Silex that there is no problem with phone connections. He
said some radio stations broadcast the wrong number and many
consumers were simply misdialing.
   The correct number is 1-800-341-3333.

   ``Darkman'' lit up box office cash registers
while ``Ghost'' gained ground in the race for the summer's top hit.
   ``Darkman,'' which pits a scientist-turned-avenger against bad
guys who disfigured him, opened with weekend receipts of $8.1
million, according to figures released Monday by Entertainment Data
Inc.,
   ``Ghost'' maintained its strong showing with $7.5 million in
sales. The film has made $111.5 million and could soon pass ``Total
Recall'' as the summer's No. 1 hit.
   ``Flatliners,'' about medical students who flirt with near-death
experiences, took in $5 million.
   ``Presumed Innocent'' grossed $4.6 million in fourth place. The
Steve Martin gangster comedy ``My Blue Heaven'' sold $3.8 million
for fifth place.
   ``Exorcist III'' was in sixth position, plunging 61 percent from
its first-place opening with a weekend gross of $3.7 million.
   ``Men at Work,'' featuring Emilio Estevez and brother Charlie
Sheen, opened in seventh place with $3.2 million.
   ``Taking Care of Business,'' a comedy starring James Belushi and
Charles Grodin, slipped to eighth on $3.1 million.
   In ninth and fading was the Mel Gibson war story ``Air
America,'' which took in $2.5 million.
   ``The Witches,'' in a somewhat limited opening, collected $2.2
million in its first weekend for 10th place.
   ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams'' played strongly on seven screens,
grossing $103,938. But ``Wild at Heart,'' David Lynch's offbeat
road movie, fell from its 10th place opening last week as sales
dropped more than 40 percent to $1.7 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Entertainment Data, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.

   Fifty-two exhausted Americans reached freedom in Turkey on
Monday after an ordeal in Iraq and occupied Kuwait, and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said ``it is time for
diplomacy'' to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Life was not getting easier for Westerners held against their
will in Iraq, and an American hostage was reported Tuesday to have
died, apparently of a heart attack.
   In Vienna, nearly all OPEC ministers tentatively agreed early
Tuesday to permit some countaries to increase oil production
immediately in response to the crisis. Iran was the lone holdout,
and Iraq and Libya did not attend.
   World markets rebounded and gold and oil prices fell, apparently
on the rare good news from the Middle East. Stocks prices soared
Tuesday in early trading in Tokyo and the dollar opened sharply
lower against the yen.
   Elsewhere, Iraqi captains received orders not to defy a U.N.
embargo but to allow U.S. warships to stop and search their
vessels, according to several broadcast and published reports.
   The State Department said it could not confirm such reports, but
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said ``We certainly hope they are
true.'' White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said:
``We're aware of the press reports. We have nothing to confirm.''
   However, the Iraqi ambassador to United States, Mohammed Sadiq
al-Mashat, seemed to confirm the reports during an appearance on
ABC's Nightline:
   ``We are doing our best ourselves to defuse the tension _ I
mean, the order that we have given to the captains of the ship not
to resist ...'' He did not elaborate.
   Baghdad detained three young men, sons of American diplomats, at
the Turkish border, separating them from their families.
   The State Department ordered 36 Iraqi diplomats expelled _
two-thirds of the Iraqi Embassy staff in Washington _ and imposed
travel restrictions on those remaining.
   In Kuwait, diplomats kept up a test of wills with Iraqi
authorities who demand they close their embassies. France said it
would ask the United Nations to help the besieged diplomats.
   President Bush was pessimistic about prospects for a diplomatic
settlement to the crisis. ``I don't particularly see more hope
now,'' he said Monday.
   Early Tuesday, CNN reported from Baghdad that the Iraqis had
told the U.S. charge d'affaires, Joseph Wilson, that an American
had died, apparently of a heart attack.
   Wilson was quoted as saying the man was in his mid-50s and had
been taken from Kuwait to a strategic site in Basra, Iraq.
   About 21,000 Westerners are stranded in Iraq and Kuwait,
including 3,000 Americans, and Iraq says some have been distributed
among Iraqi strategic sites for use as human shields to deter a
U.S. attack.
   In the gritty reaches of the Saudi Arabian desert, U.S. troop
deployment continued. Army Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, in charge of
logistics for the U.S. forces, said an average 50 U.S. transport
flights were arriving daily.
   Americans who arrived safely in Turkey on Monday began their
journey last week as a group of 100 American diplomats and
dependents who left Kuwait after Iraq's embassy-closing order. In
Baghdad, Iraq detained the men but allowed the 55 women and
children to leave.
   Then, at the Turkish border _ after a grueling 27-hour, 430-mile
overland trip from Baghdad _ three young men over the age of 18
were ``forcibly removed'' and sent back to the Iraqi capital, the
U.S. Embassy in Ankara said.
   Washington angrily accused Baghdad of having ``once again
reneged on its pledge'' of free passage for the dependents.
   The 52 others were taken to a NATO base in Incirlik to await a
flight home Tuesday. Base spokeswoman Marty Davis said they were
swimming, relaxing, and having ``pizza and ice cream cones.''
   Their ordeal _ coupled with other Iraqi actions against
diplomats _ angered American officials.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Iraqi
Embassy staff was being reduced from 55 to 19, and a U.S. official
said those expelled had 72 hours to leave the country. Remaining
Iraqi diplomats were limited to a 25-mile radius of Washington.
   In Kuwait, electricity and water are cut off to many foreign
missions _ including the U.S. Embassy _ and Iraqi troops ring the
missions. Telephone service to many is cut.
   The pressure was having results. Hungary and Nigeria said Monday
they were temporarily suspending embassy operations in Kuwait. Some
nations agreed earlier to close.
   Lebanon said Monday it re-established contact with its
ambassador to Kuwait, earlier reported missing.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday ``our
best estimate'' is that 63 Americans are missing or being held by
Iraq, including seven picked up over the weekend.
   In Saudi Arabia, eight U.S. senators on Monday visited U.S.
troops spearheading the multinational military effort to deter
further aggression by Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   ``You're not here alone, this is an international effort,''
Chairman Sam Nunn of the Senate Armed Services Committee told
Marines.
   King Fahd said Monday in Jiddah that Saudi Arabia welcomes a
peaceful solution to the crisis, provided Iraq withdraws from
Kuwait, the royal family is reinstated there and Iraq's buildup on
Saudi borders is dismantled.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a Kremlin meeting with
Egypt's foreign minister, stressed ``the necessity of bringing the
Arab factor to bear more strongly'' on Iraq, the Soviet news agency
Tass said.
   European military chiefs met Monday in Paris to coordinate
action after the U.N. Security Council's weekend endorsement of
using force to back up U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq.
   ABC News, citing anonymous sources, said Monday that U.S.
warships stopped two cargo ships over the weekend heading into
Aqaba, Jordan. One was boarded. Both were allowed to continue after
it was found they were not carrying cargo for Iraq, ABC reported.
   Perez de Cuellar will meet Thursday with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz in Jordan, He said the ``degree of tension'' in the
crisis led him to try to mediate personally.
   But Bush told reporters in Kennebunkport, Maine, ``Saddam
Hussein has been so resistant to complying wth international law
that I don't yet see fruitful negotiations.''
   Stock prices in New York meanwhile ran up their steepest gain of
the year on Monday. The Dow Jones average soared 78.71 to close at
2,611.63. Stock market prices also rose in Tokyo.
   Oil prices plummeted. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
October-delivery price of light sweet crude dropped $4 to close at
$26.91.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
key indicator, surged 523.66 points, or 2.08 percent, to 25,665.42
within the first 30 minutes of trading Tuesday.
   And gold dropped $17.58 an ounce on Hong Kong markets Tuesday,
opening at $392.82. It had closed at $410.40 on Friday.
   Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait after accusing it of depriving Iraq
of vital oil revenues by stealing Iraqi oil and exceeding OPEC
production quotas, helping drive down prices worldwide.

   Security forces have arrested the father
of three reputed leaders of the Medellin cocaine cartel, the cartel
leaders' sister told a local radio station.
   Fabio Ochoa, father of Jorge Luis, Juan David and Fabio, was
detained Monday at his ranch on the outskirts of Medellin, said
Marta Nieves Ochoa. She contacted Caracol radio in Medellin to
report the arrest, a reporter said.
   Police said Monday that they could not confirm the arrest.
   Miss Ochoa said her father was arrested along with his wife and
50 other suspects, mostly workers at the ranch.
   There was no immediate explanation of why Ochoa, a life-long
rancher, would be arrested. Although his sons are among Colombia's
most wanted men, he faces no criminal charges.
   The elder Ochoa has been arrested on two other occassions, but
was released each time.
   Miss Ochoa said her father was detained by plainclothesmen who
descended on the ranch from two helicopters, according to the
Caracol reporter. She said military vehicles surrounded the area
shortly thereafter.
   The Ochoa brothers are said to be the most powerful force in the
Medellin cartel after Pablo Escobar, the gang's leader. Both
Escobar and the Ochoas remain at large.
   A year ago, the government began a crackdown on Colombian
traffickers, who once provided about 80 percent of the cocaine on
U.S. markets. The crackdown included extraditing drug runners for
prosecution in the United States.
   Drug lords have responded with a terror campaign of bombings and
assassinations.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose for
the third consecutive trading day Tuesday, while the dollar closed
sharply lower.
   The dollar closed at 143.20 yen, down 1.60 yen from Monday's
close. It opened at 143.55 yen and ranged between 142.95 yen and
143.55 yen.
   It was the first time that the dollar opened at the 143 yen
level since it started trading at 143.10 yen on Jan. 30.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 569.00
points, or 2.26 percent, to close at 25,710.76. The index rose
976.00 points on Monday.
   Traders said optimism about developments in the Persian Gulf
encouraged investors to hunt for bargains following a series of
plunges last week.
   From the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 through Monday, the
Nikkei plunged 5,692 points.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's weakness was carried over
from its overnight downswing in New York amid selling triggered by
a perception that tensions have eased in the Middle East.
   ``The basic sentiment toward the dollar remains weak,'' said
Toshiaki Kamisaka, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Kamisaka said the dollar's slide was accelerated by a U.S.
television report that the Iraqi army's frontline troops were
withdrawing from the border of Saudi Arabia. Life insurance and
trading companies were among those who sold dollars, he said.
   Other dealers said Japanese investors were selling the dollar to
buy the yen based on an optimistic view of the chances for a
negotiated settlement to the Gulf crisis.
   ``Investors think there will be no war at least until
Thursday,'' when United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar reportedly meets with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz,
said Akiko Baba, a Bank of Tokyo dealer.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to surge widely
with favorable factors such as an overnight rise on Wall Street,
declining oil prices and the yen's appreciation against the dollar,
securities dealers said.
   Oil prices were bid down on the assumption that many members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna
would agree to boost output to offset the shortages left by the
international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, traders said.
   North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was valued at
$26.40 to $26.60 a barrel, down from $26.60 to $26.80 late Monday.
   In bond markets, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond stood at 82.73 points, up from Monday's
close of 82.54. The yield was 8.180 percent, down from 8.225
percent.

   A sheriff opposed to ``warehousing''
prisoners has inmates plowing and fertilizing plots of land for
gardens tended by the elderly, with the harvest going to the jail
kitchen or to charity.
   ``We're just so grateful we have this opportunity to do it,''
said Elizabeth Burke, 85, one of the gardeners honored Monday at a
ceremony marking the program's third year.
   Mrs. Burke said she had no qualms about taking part in a program
with prisoners. ``They've got two eyes and a nose and a mouth just
like me,'' she said. ``These boys have just gone wrong.''
   The program was started by Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe,
whose unorthodox style caused controversy in February when he
seized a National Guard armory in nearby Springfield to house
overflow inmates from the county jail.
   The inmates were later moved to an armory in Holyoke until a
new, bigger jail is built. Some of those inmates are among those
doing the heavy work at the jail farm, generally out of sight of
the senior citizen gardeners.
   To ease community objections to the temporary jail in Holyoke, a
town of 45,000 in western Massachusetts, inmates have patched
streets, swept gutters and mowed lawns.
   ``When you think of a jail you think of something that's very
isolated, sort of a fortress in the woods,'' Ashe told the group of
29 senior citizens who work a half-acre at the farm about two miles
from the county jail.
   ``It's a joy for us to see you involved,'' Ashe said. ``It's
great to have you participate and I know the inmates make comments
to us that they feel good about their own self-respect.''
   Fifteen inmates with good records who have almost finished their
sentences work on eight acres of corn, tomatoes and other
vegetables _ enough produce to save the county about $30,000 a
year. Surplus food goes to charity.
   On Monday, the first golden globes from a pumpkin patch planted
for poor children were showing.
   The older gardeners, often cooped up indoors, said the program
has given them the kind of space they haven't had in years.
   ``I think it's tremendous,'' said Ed Morytko, 71. ``I think it's
a healthful sort of thing, not only for the seniors, but also for
the inmates.''
   Morytko, who has been in the program for a year, admitted that
at first ``I didn't know what to expect.'' But a friend who had
already gardened at the farm ``told me not to be foolish,'' and
Morytko said he'll be back next year.
   Sandra Smith, acting director of the Agawam Senior Center, said
the popularity of the farm project has grown. ``I have people on
the waiting list now that want to come in next year,'' she said.
   Inmates said they relish the chance to work outdoors rather than
spending their time in a cell.
   ``We have a lot more freedom in here,'' said a 23-year-old
inmate spraying corn for pests. ``In a way it shows me that you get
to earn your money and you get to earn your living.''

<HEAD>Irish Campaigned for Keenan With His Irishness and His Educator's
Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish government worked painstakingly
behind the scenes to persuade Iran that hostage Brian Keenan is a
citizen of a small country whose only political mission in the
Middle East was one of peace.
   But the goverment said it was only after Iran decided to improve
relations with the West that Dublin's persistence paid off with
Keenan's release Friday after four years and four months in
captivity.
   Iran's ambassador to Ireland said Monday that Iran would like
Keenan's release followed by freedom for all hostages in Lebanon as
quickly as possible; Westerners as well as hundreds of Palestinians
and Iranians.
   ``We are trying everything we can to do away with the problem
once and for all,'' Ambassador Bahram Ghassemi said in an interview.
   But he said the West must help by pressuring Israel to release
certain prisoners, such as Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, an official of
the Moslem extremist group Hezbollah captured in south Lebanon on
July 28, 1989.
   Iran has influence in Lebanon ``but we don't dictate
everything,'' he said. ``If we can have the good will of the West,
it would give a freer hand to us.''
   He stressed that Iran would continue working for the release of
all hostages on humanitarian grounds without any preconditions, but
Western help would speed the process.
   Ghassemi said Iran had responded to repeated requests from the
Irish government ``and good relations between the two countries''
in seeking help from Lebanese groups to free Keenan.
   Ghassemi said Iran only opened a Dublin embassy in 1983 and he
arrived in 1986 as his country's first ambassador. Since then,
commercial ties, mainly meat exports, have expanded 10 times and
relations are ``at the best possible level now,'' he said.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey said, ``persistent, skillful
diplomacy'' had secured Keenan's release, and pledged that Ireland
would do everything possible to win freedom for other hostages
still held in Beirut.
   Thirteen Westerners are believed held by extremist Moslem groups
in Lebanon including six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans
and an Italian. The longest-held hostage, Associated Press
correspondent Terry Anderson, was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins has said several times that
there was no deal to secure Keenan's release.
   ``No money was paid. There was no ransom,'' he said.
   Much of the Irish and British news media praised Ireland's
successful diplomacy. But former Cabinet Minister Conor Cruise
O'Brien said that far from a gesture of Iranian good will, Keenan's
release was ``a calculated move, intended to increase pressure on
Britain and the United States.''
   The Keenan case was unusual from the start. He was born in
Protestant-dominated and British-ruled Northern Ireland. But,
although a Protestant, he chose a passport from the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic, a document to which Irish people
from the north are also entitled.
   Keenan, now 39, disappeared while walking to work at the
American University of Beirut April 11, 1986.
   An Irish diplomat in Beirut, John Rowan, found his passport
within hours and circulated pictures on Lebanese news media showing
Keenan was Irish, not British.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
said this may have saved Keenan's life. Four days later, the United
States bombed Libya using British-based fighters, and two Britons
were slain in Beirut shortly afterward.
   From the earliest days after Keenan's kidnapping, the spokesman
said, Irish diplomats in the Middle East stressed that he had gone
to Beirut as an educator, not ``in an exploitative capacity.''
   The government's message was that Ireland's involvement in the
Middle East was benevolent, non-aggressive and ``purely a
peacekeeping one,'' the spokesman said. Ireland has contributed 750
troops to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon near the
Israeli border.
   Every time the Irish spoke about Keenan they spoke of all
hostages, the spokesman said. For this reason, Ireland did not
stress its neutrality and nonmembership in NATO, which would have
singled Keenan out.
   Collins not only pressed Keenan's case around the globe but made
several comments recently which pleased the Iranians.
   He condemned Israel for bombing Hezbollah targets and for its
treatment of Hezbollah prisoners in southern Lebanon.
   All this was happening at a time when Iran after a costly
eight-year war with Iraq was trying to restore political and trade
relations with the West.

<HEAD>Quebec Premier Orders Removal Of Barricades, Some Mohawks Flee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Mohawks fled their reservations after
Quebec's premier ordered the army to tear down road and bridge
barricades that Indians built in a seven-week-old armed standoff
with authorities born of a land dispute.
   Premier Robert Bourassa also told reporters he was breaking off
talks with the Mohawks and accused them of not negotiating in good
faith.
   In comments carried live on Canadian television on Monday,
Bourassa said he was obliged to assume his responsibility for
public order.
   ``We Quebecers and Canadians cannot tolerate groups of citizens
living in Quebec choosing which laws they want to respect and which
they want to ignore,'' the premier said.
   To back a claim on land, the Indians had first barricaded a road
to a golf course that local officials wanted to expand onto what
the Mohawks claimed were tribal lands. Warriors then blocked a
bridge that links Montreal with its southern suburbs, adding hours
to daily commutes and angering residents.
   Bourassa said he had asked the Canadian army to take down the
barriers, ``and I hope in the coming days we will have a resolution
to this crisis.''
   In a statement issued Monday night, the Mohawk Nation said
members of the two Mohawk communities involved were prepared to
stand and fight.
   ``Now that war is being forced upon us, we will turn our hearts
and minds to war and it too we will wage with all our might,'' the
statement said.
   But in Kahnawake, just south of Montreal, at least 100 women and
children were evacuated by boats over the St. Lawrence River Monday
night.
   Several residents were also reported fleeing the Kahnesatake
reservation, near Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal and site of the
golf course dispute.
   Those who left Kahnesatake were not allowed to return Monday
evening. Soldiers setting up checkpoints around the community said
they had instructions to bar access to everyone but those carrying
food and medicine.
   Gen. John de Chastelain, chief of staff of the Canadian Forces,
said in Ottawa that soldiers would refrain from force against the
Indians ``unless obliged to do so by the Warriors.''
   A week ago, troops replaced Quebec provincial police at the
Indian barricades.
   Chastelain did not say how or when the army would move, but
indicated it would be soon. He said he hoped the Mohawks would
simply abandon their positions at the barriers and allow the army
to cart away the pieces.
   Part of the problem with the negotiations has to do with the
confused nature of Mohawk politics. Various groups vie for
leadership on the numerous reserves. Some claim the militant
Warrior society has usurped authority from elected native officials.
   Mohawks from the Kahnesatake reserve at Oka had set up a
barricade across the main road into the reserve to protest the
town's plan to expand the golf course onto territory they claimed.
   On July 11, provincial police attempted to storm the barricade,
but were repulsed. A policeman was shot and killed in the attempt,
although it was not clear who killed him.
   After the police action, Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve set
up a sympathy blockade at Chateauguay, cutting off the Mercier
Bridge across the St. Lawrence River that links Montreal's southern
suburbs with the city.
   That blockade caused a major disruption of traffic, forcing many
people to make long detours. It also led to rising tempers among
local residents, against both the police and the Indians.
   The issue of the golf course was resolved early on when the
federal government agreed to buy the land and turn it over to the
natives. But since then, the Mohawks have used the situation to air
a much wider series of demands, including sovereignty.
   Bernard Roy, the federal government's negotiator, said Monday
that the Mohawk demand for immunity from prosecution for those
involved in the July 11 shootout was unacceptable.
   The Mohawks had agreed, in what they called a gesture of good
faith, to open one lane of the Mercier bridge to traffic. That was
rejected by Bourassa, who termed the offer not serious.

   Blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan had
beaten drugs and alcohol and fellow musicians said he was playing
better than ever when he died in a helicopter crash shortly after a
concert. He was 35.
   Four others died early Monday after Vaughan and members of
guitarist Eric Clapton's entourage took off for Chicago in dense
fog.
   Vaughan, a two-time Grammy winner known for his rocking Texas
roadhouse blues style, had shared the bill Sunday night with
Clapton and guitarist Robert Cray.
   ``His death is particularly sad, given that he'd cleaned up and
was playing the best music of his life,'' said Jeff Peterson of the
``Austin City Limits'' TV program on which the Texan had appeared.
   Vaughan in the mid-1980s gained popularity with his guitar
jamming and blues sound reminiscent of music legends B.B. King,
Muddy Waters and Albert King.
   ``Stevie Ray Vaughan was like one of my children,'' said B.B.
King. ``The loss is a great loss for blues music and all fans of
music around the world. He was just beginning to be appreciated and
develop his potential.''
   In Austin and San Antonio, hundreds of fans held candlelight
vigils Monday night in memory of Vaughan. Some wore T-shirts from
his concerts and copies of his trademark wide-brimmed felt hat.
   Vaughan had sought treatment for drugs after he collapsed during
an engagement in London in the mid-1980s.
   ``This might sound funny, but fortunately I collapsed,'' Vaughan
told The Associated Press last fall.
   ``In a sense, I knew this thing was coming, I knew I couldn't
keep going the way it was. I had a nervous breakdown. I had not
been able to obtain any drugs for about two weeks, but the drinking
was still going on. If I was awake I was guzzling something.''
   At the time of his death, Vaughan was looking forward to the
release of an album in September recorded with his older brother,
Jimmie, said Andy Schwartz, a spokesman for Epic Records in New
York, which owns Vaughan's label.
   ``He was one musician who never wanted to stop and I think he
wanted to go on 'til he couldn't stand on stage anymore,'' Schwartz
said.
   Jimmie Vaughan, himself a well-known musician who formed The
Fabulous Thunderbirds, was at the weekend concert.
   The helicopter lifted off at about 12:35 a.m. and the wreckage
was found about 7 a.m. All the victims died on impact, said
Walworth County Coroner John Griebel said.
   They included three Clapton associates: agent Bobby Brooks, 34,
of Los Angeles, bodyguard Nigel Browne of London, and Colin Smythe
of London, a tour manager. The pilot, Jeff Brown of East Chicago,
Ind., also was killed.
   Brooks worked for Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles and
represented such acts as Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash; Whoopi Goldberg;
Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians; Jeff Beck, Pat Benatar;
Jackson Browne, and Dolly Parton.
   Clapton, who landed safely in Chicago on another helicopter,
said the victims ``were my companions, my associates and my
friends. This is a tragic loss of some very special people.''
   Ronnie Lippin, Clapton's spokesman, said there was no truth to
reports that Vaughan had traded seats with Clapton to get an
earlier flight.
   Born Stephen Ray Vaughan in Dallas, he began playing the guitar
at 7, copying his older brother, and started playing in Dallas
clubs at age 13.
   Vaughan and his band Double Trouble produced the platinum album
``Couldn't Stand the Weather'' in 1984. He won a Grammy Award that
year for best traditional blues recording for the song ``Texas
Flood.''
   This year, he won a Grammy for the album ``In Step,'' which
referred to the ``12 Steps'' program used by recovering alcoholics.

<HEAD>Drought Brings High Fire Risk to Pogo's Home Swamp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WAYCROSS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pogo's home swamp is so dry that
overcrowded alligators are starting to eat each other.
   A summer drought has turned the Okefenokee Swamp into a
tinderbox, with water levels at their lowest in 20 years, said Don
Perkuchin, manager of a 396,000-acre national refuge in the swamp.
   Fire danger and a wildlife crisis forced the refuge's closure to
fishing enthusiasts and boaters.
   ``A lot of the canoe trails have no water,'' Perkuchin said.
``We're very dry and it's been a cumulative effect over the last
decade. What it's going to take is a major tropical system to dump
a 5- or 10-inch rain, or a long period of substantial rain to turn
things around.''
   Okefenokee Swamp, encompassing about 700 square miles mostly in
southeast Georgia, is the real-life wetland the serves as the
fictional home of comic strip character Pogo, created by late
cartoonist Walt Kelly.
   Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge workers are using a
helicopter to spot small fires, most sparked by lightning,
Perkuchin said.
   ``We've had lightning strikes and we've had to go out and dump
water on those,'' he said in a recent phone interview from his
Folkston office.
   A fire discovered July 7 burned 4,500 acres of swamp land before
it was doused. ``If things continue to stay dry, the fire hazard
can get worse,'' Perkuchin said.
   Much of Georgia has been plagued by drought since June. Farmers
have suffered up to $350 million in crop losses and some
communities in the Atlanta area have had to restrict water use.
   Bill Cribbs, a biology professor at Valdosta State College who
has made a lifelong study of the swamp, said the crisis is hitting
wildlife.
   ``Younger gators are being eaten by other gators,'' he said.
``Fish resources are really taking a beating both from consumption
by other animals and reduced habitat. A lot of the bird life you'd
normally see, you just don't have around the swamp.''
   The Suwannee River, one of two rivers that originate in the
swamp, is almost dry, Cribbs said.
   ``It's not 6 inches deep in some places and you have to drag the
boat,'' he said, adding that September and October are usually the
swamp's driest months, followed by a three-month wet season that
typically begins in December.
   ``I'm expecting it to get much drier before it gets better,
unless we have a hurricane,'' he said.
   Alligators feeding on each other might actually be a good thing,
he said.
   ``When you have a drought period and all the water recedes to
these small areas, the alligators eat turtles, snakes, smaller
alligators and even the raccoons that come to feed,'' he said. ``If
they didn't eat their own population, there'd be nothing to hold
the (alligator) population in check.''
   Jimmy Spikes, assistant manager of Okefenokee Swamp Park near
Waycross, said his park is still able to offer guided 25-minute
boat tours, but had to cancel its two-hour tours deep into the
swamp because of low water.
   Attendance is down because many tourists assume that all boat
trails are closed, Spikes said, adding that the park featuring
wildlife exhibits, snake shows and historical attractions usually
draws up to 125,000 visitors a year.
   The swamp is home to more than 25 species of birds, including
the sand hill crane and the endangered red cockaded woodpecker.
Other residents include black bears, armadillos, at least two types
of rattlesnakes, water moccasins and endangered eastern indigo
snakes.

<HEAD>Earth Heating Up Faster, International Scientific Investigation
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLINE MAINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDSVALL, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth is heating up faster than
previously documented and it is imperative that nations agree to
reduce gases responsible for global warming, say scientists at a
conference on climactic change.
   ``We face warming trends faster than at any time in 10,000
years,'' Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Program,
said Monday in an opening speech outlining the results of a
two-year international climate study.
   The conclusion that the Earth is heating by one-third of a
degree Celsius each decade is among the conclusions of a draft
document being debated at the four-day conference.
   About 300 government officials, lawyers and scientists from 70
countries are hoping to adopt a final report that would be a basis
for United Nations action on fighting the ``greenhouse effect.''
   The United States, represented by a 25-person delegation, has
objected to some preliminary conclusions of the report, which was
prepared by 1,000 atmospheric experts from industrialized and
developing countries.
   In the past, U.S. officials have resisted a worldwide ceiling on
emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that scientists believe causes
60 percent of the ``greenhouse effect.'' Increasing levels of
carbon dioxide are believed to trap heat from the sun, gradually
warming the planet.
   The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any country,
and 75 percent of all ``greenhouse'' gases are emitted by the
Western industrialized nations.
   President Bush is among leaders calling for more exact
measurements of the effects of carbon dioxide and precise
predictions of the result of emission reduction before he would
consider mandatory ceilings.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan are the major
industrialized countries which have not imposed voluntary ceilings
on carbon dioxide production within their borders.
   The preliminary draft report by the scientists says emissions
resulting from human activities are substantially increasing
concentration of carbon dioxide and other ``greenhouse'' gases in
the atmosphere.
   Tolba called for immediate negotiations on a treaty providing
controls of carbon dioxide emissions.
   G.O.P. Obashi, secretary-general of the World Meteorological
Organization, said, ``To solve the problem of `greenhouse' gases
requires the industrialized countries to change their
over-consuming ways.
   ``It also requires that development in the less industrialized
world goes forward in a sustainable manner,'' he said. ``And this
will require a large flow of assistance, both financial and
technological, from North to South.''
   The four-day conference in Sundsvall, 240 miles north of
Stockholm, is expected to make specific recommendations on what the
world should do about climate change.
   A second World Climate Conference will follow in Geneva in
October, and a Framework Convention of Climate Change is scheduled
in Washington, D.C. in February.

<HEAD>Share Prices Up, Dollar Sharply Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied
for the third consecutive trading day today, while the dollar
closed sharply lower.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 569.00
points, or 2.26 percent, to close at 25,710.76. The index gained
976.00 points Monday, following a 428.13-point gain last Friday.
   Dealers attributed the Nikkei index's gain to an overnight
advance on Wall Street, declining oil prices and the yen's
appreciation against the dollar.
   ``Share prices are recovering almost across the board,'' said
Kazuyuki Suzuki, an analyst with Daiwa Securities.
   Since the Middle East crisis erupted after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Nikkei index had lost a total of 6,239.87
points, or 20.23 percent, as of last Thursday.
   Suzuki said a decline in the nation's interest rates, though
marginal, also provided a favorable factor to the stock market.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond closed at 82.68 points, up from Monday's
close of 82.54. The yield stood at 8.190 percent, down from 8.225
percent.
   The dollar closed at 143.20 yen, down 1.60 yen from Monday's
close of 144.80 yen. After opening at 143.55 yen, the currency
ranged between 142.95 yen and 143.55 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained weak throughout the
day because of falling oil prices and traders' perceptions that
tensions have eased in the Middle East.
   ``The yen-selling factor is dwindling because of the decline in
crude oil prices,'' said Masahiro Sahara, a dealer with Industrial
Bank of Japan.
   Persian Gulf crude oil prices were below late Monday New York
levels in Tokyo today.
   Traders said reports that Iraq has pulled its troops back from
Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, and that OPEC will allow its
members to exceed their quotas during the Mideast crisis have
caused the market to weaken further.
   Dubai Fateh crude for October delivery was notionally valued at
about $24.80-$24.90 a barrel, down from $25.04 level late Monday in
New York. Monday's Asian level was about $29.45.
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is
scheduled to meet with with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz this
week to discuss the Gulf crisis.

   Japan is nearing completion of a package to assist
the multinational blockade of Iraq, and it will include sending
medical personnel and financial assistance to the Middle East,
government officials said today.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the package, expected to be
announced on Wednesday, will include assistance for the
multinational force arrayed against Iraq and aid to Middle East
countries suffering economic hardship because of the blockade,
according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   While the United States has poured tens of thousands of troops
into Saudi Arabia to halt further aggression by Iraq after its Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, Tokyo has been slow to decide on further
measures beyond its participation in the global boycott on trade
with Baghdad.
   Government officials have been promising ``unprecedented steps''
to punish Iraq, but have been slow to respond because of debate
over the legality of sending military units to the Gulf and of
providing the U.S.-led naval blockade of Iraq with direct financial
aid.
   The Japanese constitution adopted after World War II bars the
use of force in settling international disputes.
   Tokyo also is concerned about the safety of the more than 450
Japanese nationals still in Iraq and Kuwait, including about 20 who
were whisked away from their Baghdad hotel to undisclosed
destinations.
   A government source, speaking on condition he not be identified
further, said Tokyo is ``very likely'' to send a medical team of up
to 100 people to Saudi Arabia to help care for refugees in the
crisis.
   Japan also plans to use civil aircraft to transport non-military
material and food for the multinational force, the source said. The
government is expected to charter two cargo planes from Japan
Airlines, one source said.
   ``Transportation of military personnel and weapons is acceptable
according to our interpretation of our domestic laws,'' said a
senior government source, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
``However, there are difficulties to ask a commercial airline
company to carry lethal and heavily military products.''
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama returned Saturday from a tour of
the Middle East in which he assessed the needs of Oman, Jordan,
Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. While government officials have
declined to estimate how much money Tokyo will offer, the
assistance required by the region's countries could run into the
billions of dollars.

   Vaughan, who had overcome drug and alcohol problems, gained
popularity in the mid-1980s with his guitar jamming and blues
sound, borrowed from such music legends as B.B. King.
   Vaughan toured this summer with blues singer Joe Cocker, and was
to release a new record in September with his brother Jimmie,
another well-known musician who formed The Fabulous Thunderbirds
band.
   Vaughan had a platinum album with Double Trouble in ``Couldn't
Stand the Weather,'' released in 1984. That same year, he won a
Grammy for best traditional blues recording for the song ``Texas
Flood.''
   He won a 1990 Grammy in the contemporary blues category for ``In

after a night of thunderstorms, including one that beaned Minnesota
with baseball-sized hail.
   The forecast for the nation was hot _ one of the worst days in a
late-summer heat wave.
   High pressure stretching from coast to coast was expected to
bring temperatures in the 90s to the East, South and West and highs
in the 100s to the Plains and Southwest. Heat advisories were in
effect for Arkansas and Kentucky.
   The only cooler spots foreseen were in the Great Lakes and the
Pacific Northwest regions, where showers were likely with highs in
the 80s. Showers were also forming over Florida, Texas and
Louisiana and Arizona and New Mexico.
   On Monday, several cities in Texas, Kansas and Louisiana broke
or tied records for high temperatures. Those record were in danger
of being broken today.
   The high for the nation Monday was 106 degrees at Austin, Texas;
Medicine Lodge, Kan.; Waco, Texas, and Wichita, Kan.

<HEAD>Iran Arrests 20 Opposition Members; More Arrests Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 20 members of an Iranian opposition
group have been arrested for waging ``psychological warfare''
against Iranian officials and more arrests are likely, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Ali Fallahiyan, Iran's Minister of Security and Intelligence,
told reporters Monday that those arrested were members of The
Association for the Defense of the Iranian People's Sovereignty and
Freedom Movement.
   He did not say when they were detained.
   The Freedom Movement, headed by former Iranian Prime Minister
Mehdi Bazargan, is the only visible opposition inside Iran.
   Bazargan, 83, was the first prime minister of the Islamic
Republic after it was established in 1979 by the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. He is known to be a pious Moslem with a large following
among Tehran's powerful merchant community.
   Eight members of the Freedom Movement were arrested in June
after 90 followers signed a scathing open letter to President
Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for the restoration of constitutional
rights.
   A source at the time said the letter, which shook the
government, called Bazargan the ``only voice of conscience inside
Iran.''
   Earlier this month, one of those arrested in June appeared on
television reading a statement that said the group had been
directed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
   Fallahiyan said Monday that confessions obtained from those
arrested would lead to more being rounded up, according to IRNA,
which was monitored in Nicosia.
   He said those arrested aimed to ``wage psychological warfare
against the Islamic Republic officials'' by repeating information
disseminated by ``counterrevolutionaries abroad'' and the Voice of
America.
   ``Besides being linked to the outside world, they were involved
in efforts to wage psychological warfare and create dissatisfaction
among people,'' the minister was quoted as saying.
   He said Iran's security service had identified and crushed
``U.S. espionage networks'' in the country, IRNA said.

   The dollar took a beating from the Japanese yen
today but rallied against most other currencies.
   Gold recovered from its Monday lows in New York, where it closed
at $388.50 an ounce, but was well below Monday's levels in Europe.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.20 yen, down 1.60 yen from
Monday's close of 144.80 yen. Later in London, the dollar was
quoted at 143.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.5478 West German marks, up from 1.5423
   _1.2768 Swiss francs, up from 1.2670
   _5.1888 French francs, up from 5.1745
   _1.7475 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7365
   _1,145.00 Italian lire, up from 1,142.75
   _1.1390 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1335
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9510, compared
with $1.9505 late Monday in Europe. London's markets had been
closed for a holiday on Monday.
   Currency dealers in Tokyo said the dollar remained weak
throughout the day due to falling oil prices and traders'
perceptions that tensions have eased in the Middle East.
   ``The yen-selling factor is dwindling because of the decline in
crude oil prices,'' said Masahiro Sahara, a dealer with Industrial
Bank of Japan.
   Peter Kane, chief corporate dealer at Credit Suisse in London,
said good news over the weekend had helped the yen but had little
impact on the dollar.
   ``The dollar isn't benefiting either from an easing or a
heightening of tension in the (Persian) Gulf,'' said Tim Fox,
Treasury economist at Midland Bank PLC in London. He said this
highlights the fundamental weakness of the dollar and said it is
``well-entrenched in a bearish trend.''
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $392.55 a
troy ounce this morning, as trading resumed following a bank
holiday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $392.50, down from $401.00 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $392.59 per ounce, down $18.36 from
Friday's closing price. The Hong Kong market was closed Monday for
a holiday.
   Dealers noted that although the price had advanced in London
Tuesday, most of the bounce was technical rather than driven by

   Contra courier Eugene Hasenfus, jailed in Nicaragua
while the U.S. government disavowed knowledge of a clandestine
rebel supply network, is due no damages because he knew the risks
involved, a jury decided.
   The federal court jury on Monday denied damages to ruled
Hasenfus, his wife and the family of pilot Wallace Sawyer Jr., who
was killed when Sandinista troops shot down their supply plane in
1986.
   Jurors agreed Hasenfus and Sawyer were working for Miami-based
Southern Air Transport and had been hired by retired Air Force Gen.
Richard Secord, but ruled the men were independent contractors well
aware of the risks.
   Hasenfus, his wife and Sawyer's family sought to recoup lost
wages and other damages resulting from the crash in a civil lawsuit
against Southern Air Transport and Secord, who helped supply the
Contra rebels.
   Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis., was dejected after the decision.
   ``I've had so much taken from me already,'' he said. ``This is a
disappointment.''
   Hasenfus sought $57,000 in back pay and his wife Sally sought
$66,000 reimbursement for legal expenses involved in extricating
her husband from the Nicaraguan jail where he was held for three
months after the crash.
   Mrs. Hasenfus said U.S. State Department officials had assured
her that they would help pay for her husband's legal expenses while
he was in jail in Nicaragua.
   But Hasenfus' attorneys were unable to link Secord and Southern
Air to those State Department officials, explained one juror.
   ``If we could have proved the State Department (employees) were
agents of Secord and Southern Air, we would have given them
money,'' juror Ivis Charbonier said.
   ``We did feel there was a secret operation,'' said juror Wade
Harris. ``We tried very hard to live by the evidence that they gave
us, but there wasn't any proof of any oral agreement.''
   Hasenfus had claimed in the lawsuit against Secord, an
Iran-Contra figure, and Southern Air that they controlled the
illegal network and were responsible for damages suffered as a
result of the supply plane crash in Nicaragua.
   Attorneys for the defendants argued that Hasenfus and Sawyer
knew the risks of the operation, but were acting on their own and
were owed no special responsibility by the defendants.
   ``We do intend to appeal if we can raise the funds,'' said Brian
Strange, an attorney for Hasenfus.
   A defense attorney said Secord was overseas and unavailable for
comment. Secord is currently on probation after a guilty plea on
charges of lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair.
   Before deliberations began last Tuesday, U.S. District Judge C.
Clyde Atkins ruled in favor of Secord and Southern Air that the
jury should only consider claims for back salary for Hasenfus and
death benefits for Sawyer's wife in Magnolia, Ark.
   The plaintiffs had sought payment for legal bills, lost income,
mental stress and other damages, but were unable to prove their
claims of corporate _ and U.S. government _ responsibility for
their actions.
   ``They removed their fingerprints quite well from everything,''
a shaken Hasenfus said afterward. ``We won a war here, but we lost
a battle, in a way.''

   Police were unable to reach a man felled by
a heart attack in his yard because he was surrounded by 30 menacing
dogs.
   Suffolk County police were called to the home of Raymond
Jenkins, 70, Monday evening after neighbors reported the man was
calling for help, Sgt. Vincent Diresta said.
   Jenkins was found lying on a table in his fenced-in yard,
surrounded by 30 uncontrollable, snapping dogs, he said.
   Forty-five minutes later, the firefighters and animal control
officers were were able to distract the dogs with fire
extinguishers, enabling emergency workers to enter the yard and
remove Jenkins, who was then examined by a physician and pronounced
dead, apparently killed by a heart attack.

   The foreign minister says France, which is among
countries whose military forces are standing up to Iraq, is
forbidding rallies in support of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for
the duration of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We cannot tolerate demonstrations in favor of someone holding
our countrymen hostage,'' the minister, Roland Dumas, told the
Senate late Monday. ``They will be forbidden.''
   Sporadic pro-Saddam demonstrations have attracted a few hundred
people in the French capital since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
About 21,000 Westerners are stranded in Iraq and occupied Kuwait
and considered hostages.
   Dumas also said that Interior Minister Pierre Joxe has taken
``all necessary measures'' since the crisis broke to ensure that
the 1,700 Iraqi nationals living in France comply with French law.
   About a dozen Iraqi air force pilots training in France at the
time of the invasion have been ``placed under tight surveillance,''
Dumas said. Four of them tried to escape last week from a military
camp where they had been left mostly unguarded.
   Dumas spoke to the Senate during an extraordinary session of
debate about the crisis. France has sent nine warships and 180
ground troops to the region to support the United Nations embargo
of Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   The aircraft carrier Clemenceau, flagship of French forces in
the Persian Gulf, left the Red Sea port of Djibouti for the Gulf of
Oman early today, defense sources said.
   President Francois Mitterrand said Monday that helicopters from
the Clemenceau's fleet of 10 transport and 32 attack choppers will
be sent to Saudi Arabia.

   Millionaire Warren Meyer is about to realize
his decade-old dream of opening a shrine to junk mail.
   ``There's a lot more to junk mail than Ed McMahon's handsome
face,'' said Meyer, known locally as the ``junk mail king.'' His
firm Meyer &amp; Son Mailhouse is a leader in direct-mail sales drives.
   Meyer said he believes junk mail suffers from a negative image,
and he hopes his museum will deliver the respect it deserves. The
museum will be built in mid-1991 in Los Angeles.
   ``The museum is a 10-year dream and I am finally seeing it come
into fruition,'' Meyer said. He plans to run newspaper
advertisements in coming months seeking examples of junk mail
``classics'' for the museum archives.
   Junk mail serves an honorable purpose, said Meyer, who recently
donated his company's services to more than 25 charities and mailed
over 1 million pieces of nonprofit and charity direct-mail appeals
for them.

   The governor's race in today's Oklahoma
primaries has five Democrats and five Republicans seeking spots in
anticipated September runoff elections.
   The large field of hopefuls developed after Republican Gov.
Henry Bellmon declined to seek re-election.
   In Alaska, a gambling initiative divided a close race for
governor between Lt. Gov. Stephen McAlpine and former Anchorage
Mayor Tony Knowles going into today's Democratic primary.
   In the Republican race, state Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski was
heavily favored to win her second consecutive nomination.
   A measure on the November general election that would restore
criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana
also split the candidates. McAlpine tried to paint Knowles as soft
on drugs, because of the former mayor's opposition to the measure.
   Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, helped lead the campaign against
an initiative that would allow local-option casino gambling. There
was virtually no campaign for the measure, and a poll last week
found voters opposing it by 2-to-1.
   Knowles recently seized on the measure, which he opposes, after
McAlpine said he would vote for it. McAlpine said although he
opposes casino gambling he supports letting local voters decide.
   In the Oklahoma governor's race, the Democrat candidates were
U.S. Rep. Wes Watkins, state House Speaker Steve Lewis, businessman
David Walters _ the 1986 nominee _ and newcomers John Shorty
Barnett and Anne Hartin Langston.
   Seeking the GOP nomination are restaurant chain owner Vince
Orza, former U.S. attorney Bill Price, former state Human Services
Commission Chairman Burns Hargis, truck stop operator Jerry Brown
and rancher Jerry Hoyt.
   In other races, U.S. Sen. David Boren, a Democrat, was
considered an overwhelming favorite to win his party's nomination.
   Four congressmen, Republicans James Inhofe and Mickey Edwards
and Democrats Dave McCurdy and Glen English are running unopposed
in party primaries.
   Two other congressional seats were contested, with Lt. Gov.
Robert S. Kerr III and state Rep. Bill Brewster among four
Democrats seeking to succeed Watkins. Six-term incumbent Mike Synar
faced a challenge from Broken Arrow attorney Jack Ross.
   Gambling also figured in a Colorado recall drive to be decided
today.
   Three town council members in Cripple Creek say the recall was
triggered by their opposition to a proposed gambling initiative.
Recall backers say the drive was launched after the council failed
to approve several important projects, such as a fire district, a
youth center and a water main renovation plan.
   A proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 6 ballot would
legalize limited gambling in the old mining communities of Cripple
Creek, Central City and Black Hawk.

<TEXT>
   Morris Dweck was counting on the
allure of the Middle East to drum up business when he added a
roadside genie and changed the name of his miniature golf course to
``Treasures of Baghdad.''
   The changes, made well before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, have not proved popular in the vicinity of Myrtle Beach Air
Force Base.
   ``We've had this place for eight years, and up to this year, it
was known as the Golden Dragon,'' Dweck said of his 36-hole course
at a prime location across from a water park. ``Now we don't have
anybody at all during the day, and only an occasional person at
night, when it's supposed to be the most crowded.''
   Dweck spent $15,000 on a fancy ``Treasures of Baghdad'' sign and
added a roadside turbaned genie sitting cross-legged with a bobbing
head.
   Around town, one of the hottest-selling souvenirs is a T-shirt
featuring a likeness of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein above the line
``Public Enemy Number One.'' The Air Force base sent several A-10
jets to Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's been tough in a few other ways, too,'' Dweck said. ``A
man and his family came by not long ago, got ready to play and
asked us which Arabian country we were from.
   ``I told him we were Jewish and from New York, and he
immediately packed his family up and left,'' he said. ``He was from
Jordan.''

<HEAD>Advance on Fort Delayed at Damaged Causeway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sri Lankan troops were held up at a
mine-damaged causeway today in their advance to relieve the
besieged Jaffna Fort, top defense officials said.
   As soon as the army can advance from the small islands in Jaffna
lagoon across the causeway to the mainland, it intends to clear the
Tamil Tiger rebels from a one-mile perimeter around the fort,
Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said in an interview.
   The Tigers have kept the fort under siege for the past 10 weeks.
   The government assault, now in its seventh day, is the biggest
operation against the Tiger's northern stronghold since the current
round of fighting erupted June 11.
   ``We are crossing the causeway now,'' Wijeratne said. ``It's
been heavily mined. ... Our troops will repair that and get
across.''
   However, the defense secretary, Gen. Cyril Ranatunge, indicated
the task may be difficult. A 17-foot gap in the 1,500-yard causeway
must be repaired, possibly under fire from rebel mortar positions,
he told The Associated Press.
   The star-shaped, 17th-century Dutch colonial fortress dominates
Jaffna. The fort is the government's only stronghold in Jaffna town.
   Jaffna, 185 miles northeast of Colombo, is the headquarters of
the rebels seeking Tamil independence from the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   An army helicopter landed inside the fort on Monday with eight
relief soldiers and food and evacuated seven wounded policemen,
Wijeratne said.
   It was only the second time a helicopter reached the fort since
the siege began. The 250-man garrison has been supplied by
high-altitude air drops, including blocks of ice for drinking water.
   On Aug. 22 the government launched an offensive to seize three
islands west of the fort and open a corridor across the causeway to
the outpost. Wijeratne initially predicted the operation would take
two or three days.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
army had committed two battalions, or about 2,000 troops, to secure
the fort area.
   These sources said the army would have trouble holding the
built-up perimeter areas in Jaffna town, which is separated from
the fort by 500 yards of no-man's land. ``We have to hold it.
Otherwise, the Tigers will come back,'' Wijeratne said.
   Ranatunge was more cautious, admitting it would take a lot of
manpower. ``We'll see how it goes,'' he said.
   Wijeratne, seated below two pin-studded maps marking troop
deployments on this Indian Ocean island, said he would offer
civilians in Jaffna a chance to evacuate the line of fire.
   ``Once we open the corridor, options are there for the civilians
_ if they want to escape the onslaught _ there's an escape route
for them,'' he said.
   Despite the delays, he said the rebel resistance was lighter
than expected. ``They are cracking up,'' he boasted. ``They are now
getting mauled by the Sri Lankan army.''
   He said the objective of the operation was to open Jaffna
Hospital, which has been closed since the fighting began.
   Military officials claim more than two Tiger guerrillas have
been killed in the weeklong offensive.
   The Tigers, who rarely admit casualties while battles are in
progress, have acknowledged no losses and claim most of the victims
were civilians.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since Tamil guerrillas
embarked on their separatist war in 1983.
   Militants say they need their own homeland to preserve the
culture of their ethnic minority and protect it from discrimination
by Sinhalese in jobs and education. Tamils comprise 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people, while Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
There is also a Moslem minority.

   Two foreign-born servicemen took the oath of
citizenship in a special ceremony arranged to beat an anticipated
callup for Middle East duty.
   ``If something happens and I die, I want to die as an
American,'' said Marine Cpl. Keun ``Kevin'' Ho Yook, a Korean
immigrant, after Monday's ceremony before U.S. District Judge
Dickran Tevrizian.
   Yook, 24, raised his right hand along with Navy Petty Officer
2nd Class German Oswaldo Acuna, 24, a Guatemalan immigrant.
   The servicemen, wearing crisp uniforms and crew cuts, promised
to defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States.
   ``At this time you are now citizens of the greatest country of
the world, the United States of America,'' said Tevrizian, an
American-born son of Armenian immigrants.
   The pair gave the pledge of allegiance, and after the ceremony
were applauded by fellow servicemen, immigration authorities and
family members.
   ``I'm feeling great right now,'' Acuna said. ``This means that I
can talk to my shipmates and everyone else I know who's American
and say, `Look, I'm an American like you.'''
   Acuna came to America in 1981 and enlisted in the Navy in 1986.
Yook arrived in 1986 and joined the Marines about a year later. The
military allows immigrants to enlist as long as they have proper
immigration status.
   The servicemen based at Camp Pendleton had been scheduled to
attend naturalization ceremonies on Sept. 24. But the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait changed their plans.
   The pair asked the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
for a hurry-up ceremony.
   INS Western Regional Commissioner Ben Davidian said the agency
then ``bent a few rules and moved a few things around.''
   Military officials have refused to comment on deployments, but
Acuna and Yook said they were convinced they would soon be shipped
to the Middle East.
   Marine Capt. David Olsen, Yook's commanding officer, said Yook
had always talked about becoming an American citizen.
   ``To see him become a citizen is just a great inspiration to the
rest of us,'' Olsen said.

<TEXT>
   The KGB and other Soviet agencies have for the
first time agreed to open their files to help determine whether
Raoul Wallenberg really died in a Moscow prison in 1947.
   A group that believes the Swedish diplomat, who saved tens of
thousands of Hungarian Jews at the end of World War II, may still
be alive said Monday it had secured the Soviet Union's cooperation
in determining his fate.
   Wallenberg vanished after being arrested by the Soviets in
Budapest on spying charges in 1945.
   Soviet authorities have long maintained he died in the KGB's
Lubyanka Prison in 1947, but Wallenberg's relatives say they have
received reports he is alive and detained in the Soviet Union. He
would now be 77.
   ``The evidence is incontrovertible that Raoul Wallenberg did not
die in 1947, compelling that he was alive in the 50s and 60s, and
credible that he was alive thereafter,'' said Irwin Cotler, a
Canadian lawyer who has spent 10 years investigating Wallenberg's
fate.
   Cotler told a news conference that an international commission
is working on the premise that Wallenberg ``may still be alive,
though possibly under another identity, and unknown even to Soviet
prison authorities.''
   Besides Cotler, commission members include Wallenberg's
half-brother, Guy von Dardel; several Soviet journalists and
historians; and two former Soviet political prisoners _ Cronid
Lubarski, an editor, and Marvin Makinen, chairman of the University
of Chicago's biochemistry department.
   ``What you have here is a joint cooperative initiative, for the
first time, that we hope will ultimately discover the fate and
whereabouts of Raoul Wallenberg,'' Cotler told reporters at the
Swedish Embassy.
   He said the KGB, the Foreign Ministry and the Interior Ministry
had all agreed to help the commission.
   ``We have been told that we will be given access to all files on
the Wallenberg affairs,'' he said. ``Therefore, I interpret all
files to include KGB files.''
   Cotler said the commission has also asked the KGB for files
belonging to SMERSH, a defunct Soviet security agency that killed
real, suspected or potential opponents of the Soviet government.
   Cotler praised the Soviet cooperation as a step forward in
glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   ``The Soviet position has been historically, since 1957, that
Raoul Wallenberg died in 1947,'' he said. ``From 1957 to 1987 they
basically did not address this issue.''
   Cotler said the commission was granted permission to travel
Monday to Vladimir Prison, 12 miles outside Moscow, where
Wallenberg allegedly has been sighted.
   Prison officials have agreed to allow commission members to
examine their archives _ including 10,000 registration cards _ and
interview present and former inmates, guards and administrators,
Cotler said.
   Last October, Soviet officials expressed remorse for the first
time over the Stalin-era arrest of Wallenberg, a Lutheran who saved
an estimated 20,000 Jews from Nazi gas chambers by sheltering them
and issuing them false passports.
   Wallenberg, a member of a prominent family of bankers and
industrialists, repeatedy risked his life by hiding Jews in houses
he bought or rented, often with his own money. In the final days
before the liberation of Budapest, Wallenberg persuaded the Nazis
to cancel a plan to kill 70,000 Jews who were still living in the
city's ghetto.
   Last fall, KGB deputy chief Vladimir Pirozhkov returned
Wallenberg's passport, driver's license, address book, calendar and
cash to his family, saying they had been found in KGB headquarters
the previous month.
   However, the only proof offered of Wallenberg's death was a
doctor's letter, released in 1957, saying Wallenberg suffered a
fatal heart attack and was cremated.

   Connecticut and Wyoming got the best grades in
a state-by-state report card of educational performance released
today by a parents group.
   The American Association of Parents and Children prepared the
report card after an earlier study found nine out of 10 teachers
think parents don't care about education.
   The group's executive director, Scott Stapf, said the reports
should be a ``wake-up call'' telling parents they play an important
role in education.
   ``It's a disastrous message to create the impression with
parents that when you look at the national education crisis, the
only people who need to be concerned are teachers and school
administrators and state lawmakers,'' Stapf said.
   ``Unless you create a picture that includes parents in the
equation as well, you're really missing a big part,'' he said.
   The AAPC, a year-old, independent research group, compiled
dozens of studies by the Department of Education, the Carnegie
Foundation and others for its report card.
   The group graded states on their statistical performance in six
broad areas: parental apathy, Head Start participation,
student-teacher ratios, per-student spending, graduation rates and
standardized test scores. It then averaged them for an overall
grade.
   Connecticut and Wyoming were the only states to receive an
``A.'' Hawaii, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and
Louisiana got an ``F.''
   Nearly nine out of 10 teachers believe parents are apathetic
about education, a Carnegie Foundation study found last this year.
   The AAPC is trying to remedy that with a pamphlet of 10 simple
steps for parents to become more involved with schools, Stapf said.
The pamphlet is available by mail from AAPC's Herndon, Va.,
headquarters.
   A study for the national Parent Teacher Association earlier this
year also found that most parents' involvement in school is low.
   President Bush noted the study in a speech to the PTA's
legislative conference in March. ``Education is a national mission
that must include parents,'' he said.
   But Arnold Fege, the PTA's governmental relations director, on
Monday faulted Bush and the nation's governors for not making
increased parental involvement an education reform goal.
   ``Parents are frequently the orphans in education policy,'' he
said.
   Since its study, PTA leaders began developing strategies to
increase parents' role, Fege said. He said schools need to create
more flexible opportunities for parental participation.
   ``The schools have to recognize that the families have some
unique needs today that they didn't have 10 years ago,'' Fege said.
He noted there are more single parents and more families where both

<HEAD>45,000 Public Employees Stage Warning Strikes in East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 45,000 municipal workers in several
East German cities walked off their jobs for a few hours today in
warning strikes for better wages and job security in a united
Germany.
   Nurses, secretaries, bus drivers, garbage-haulers and other
employees stopped working for up to two hours in at least 10 cities.
   Demonstrations and rallies were held in a number of cities, with
workers demanding job protection and pay increases in a united
Germany. There are about 1.6 million municipal workers in East
Germany.
   West Germany is pressuring East Germany to keep costs down as a
means of helping bail out the nation from its economic woes.
   West Germany is already spending billions of dollars to prop up
its neighbor as the two countries prepare for political merger on
Oct. 3.
   The workers are demanding compensation for higher prices that
have resulted from the two Germanys' July 1 economic merger. They
also demand that East German income taxes not be immediately raised
to West German levels.
   Effects from the warning strikes were felt across East Germany.
   In Potsdam outside Berlin, buses and street cars were idle for
two hours, according to the official East German news agency, ADN.
   Parked streetcars blocked main avenues in Magdeburg, and dozens
of garbage trucks hindered access to the city's main department
store, ADN said.
   Operations at Magdeburg's Elbe River harbor were temporarily
crippled by the walkout, the news agency said.
   Short strikes were also staged in Halle, Sonneberg, Schwerin,
Frankfurt an der Oder, Chemnitz, Zwickau, Plauen, and Schoenberg.
   In Bonn, meanwhile, the West German government said Western
investors' interest in East Germany is starting to pick up. The
West German government had hoped for massive Western investment in
East Germany once the two nations merged their economies, but so
far interest has been scant.
   Dieter Vogel, spokesman for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said East German officials reported ``investment readiness ... is
increasing noticeably.'' He did not give any figures.

   Rescuers searched this morning for three crew
members of a New Bedford fishing vessel that collided in thick fog
with a Greek cargo ship, the Coast Guard said.
   Two men in the five-member fishing crew were rescued after they
were thrown into the Atlantic Ocean in the accident 42 miles east
of Nantucket.
   The 591-foot cargo ship Eurojoy struck the smaller boat, named
New England, about 7:30 a.m., officials said. Visibility was a half
mile.
   ``The tanker never saw the fishing boat at all,'' said Lt.
Richard Gill, operations center controller. ``There is debris and
there is indication that it sank,'' he added.
   The men who were rescued were picked up by the crew of the
Eurojoy, said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Greg Creedon.
   Creedon said a Coast Guard helicopter was sent to the scene from
Cape Cod and a Coast Guard rescue boat was sent from Nantucket.
   The Eurojoy was empty and on its way from Boston to Norfolk,
Va., Gill said.

   Dependents of U.S. diplomats in Kuwait seemed ``in
good spirits and good health'' when they touched down in Paris
today on a stopover on their flight home, a U.S. official said.
   ``I talked to the doctors. Everyone was in great shape,'' said
U.S. Embassy spokesman Paul Kozelka, who met with some of the tired
Americans at Charles de Gaulle-Roissy airport.
   Two American doctors were accompanying the 52 women and children
on the flight, which left the NATO base at Incirlik, Turkey, for
the United States earlier in the day.
   The dependents are headed for Andrews Air Force Base in
Washington. Their Transcontinental charter flight stopped over for
about two hours in Paris to refuel. The flight was unlisted in
normal air traffic logs, and the plane kept away from the main
airport terminal buildings.
   Reporters were not given access to passengers on the aircraft or
others shuttled to the terminal to use airport facilities.
   ``They all seemed to be in good spirits and good health ... the
kids were playing around like kids do,'' Kozelka said.
   There were six infants and another dozen or so small children
among those permitted to leave Kuwait City by Iraqi troops. The
dependents were among about 100 people evacuated from Kuwait when
the U.S. Embassy there was reduced to a skeleton staff. Iraq
eventually let the women and children in the group leave Baghdad,
but detained about 50 diplomats in the party as hostages.
   Those allowed out traveled from Baghdad, the Iraqi capital,
overland through mountains and desert to Turkey, where they boarded
a flight for home.
   ``It was long night's drive and they were disturbed by TV
cameras and flashes while they were trying to sleep,'' said Kozelka.
   When the group reached the Turkish border, three young men in
the party were ``forcibly removed'' and taken back to Baghdad. The
three, unidentified by name, were sons of U.S. diplomats over the
age of 18, U.S. officials said.
   The ordeal of the dependents _ coupled with Iraqi actions
against diplomats remaining in Baghdad and Kuwait City _ have
angered the United States.
   The State Department retaliated by ordering the Iraqi Embassy in
Washington to reduce its staff from 55 to 19. Remaining Iraqi
diplomats were ordered to stay within a 25-mile radius of
Washington.
   About 10 U.S. diplomats remain in the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait
City, despite an order by Iraq that all embassies in the city must
close. Iraq has cut off the electricity, water and phone lines to
many of the embassies but so far has not used force to empty and
close the missions.

   The United States military buildup in Saudi Arabia
has brought a rush on some recruiting stations by would-be
soldiers, including many too young or too old to fight.
   Sgt. Bob Armstrong at the Army recruiting center in Rochester,
N.Y., said he has seen the number of potential enlistments rise
from three or four people a day to five or six since the Persian
Gulf crisis began.
   ``Qualified is another story,'' Armstrong said Monday. ``We got
maybe one contract this month out of it.''
   Most of the people coming to the recruiting center say they want
to serve in the Middle East, but nearly all have been unqualified
because they are not high school graduates or have criminal
records, he said.
   Most of the interest seems directed at the Army. Air Force and
Navy officials reported little change in the number of would-be
recruits since Iraq invaded Kuwait and thousands of U.S. troops
were deployed to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Absolutely we've been getting more calls,'' said Sgt. First
Class Rick Henager, an Army recruiter in Hyannis, Mass. ``We're
talking about an increase of 1,000 percent on some days.''
   Henager took a call from a young man who had won a four-year
college scholarship but still wanted to be a medic in the Middle
East if war broke out.
   ``He said, `Look, I'm all set with my education. But if we do go
to war I want to be a part of it.' Another kid said, `I've lived in
this country 19 years. It's time I started helping with the rent.'''
   The Army National Guard in Toms River, N.J., is getting a flood
of people who have already served their country in battle.
   ``We have Vietnam vets wanting to go over,'' said Sgt. Carl
Tucker. ``Especially since they heard about the reserves being
called in, a lot of prior service people are calling us. They
figure if they can get in a reserve unit they can get called over.''
   Americans are not the only ones gung ho on getting in on the
action. Canadians are contacting New York recruiting stations to
put in a bid for active duty.
   ``Just last week alone, it's been about 20 to 25'' Canadians
calling, said Sgt. Antony Byrd, an Army recruiter in Niagara Falls.
``Before, in a week's time, we used to get maybe five.''
   In order for Canadians to join the U.S. military they must hold
green cards or dual citizenship, either through being a member of
certain Indian tribes or having a parent who is a U.S. citizen.
   Officials at the Army recruiting office in Little Rock, Ark.,
didn't wait for people to come to them. They announced last week
that they needed experienced soldiers for re-enlistment. And they
got what they asked for.
   Recruiters said they were seeking re-enlistments, and not
fresh-faced first timers, just to speed up the readiness process.
   ``If you take a young person in now who has never been trained,
it's going to be a while before they'll be ready to do anything.
... You're looking at a period of maybe six months down the road,''
said John Moss, chief of advertising and public affairs for the
Little Rock office.
   Still, even those who know they are too young to serve or well
beyond the age for military action ``just wanted to know what they
could do to help ... and I think that was great,'' Moss said.

   The Soviet Union criticized the United States
today for expelling Iraqi diplomats from Washington and warned that
such action could lead to a ``spiral of escalation'' in the
conflict.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov also indicated that
some of Iraq's Arab neighbors have failed to put enough pressure on
Baghdad in response to its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Regarding the nearly 200 military advisers the Soviet Union has
in Iraq, Gerasimov said their presence does not violate U.N.
sanctions against Iraq but that the Soviet government is looking
into the situation.
   ``Arab countries have to be more energetic in their efforts
aimed at eliminating the crisis,'' he told reporters. ``A lot
depends on the Arabs themselves ... they can make certain efforts
to find a way out of that situation.''
   The United States has ordered 36 Iraqi Embassy personnel to
leave Washington by Thursday and has imposed travel limits on the
19 envoys allowed to remain. The United States has so far been
unable to persuade its allies to expel Iraqi diplomats from other
capitals.
   The move followed Iraqi demands that foreign countries close
their embassies in Kuwait. Iraq also had briefly prevented 52
dependents of U.S. personnel from leaving its country. The group
eventually was allowed to go to Turkey and were headed home today.
   Gerasimov said the Soviet Union had no plans to expel Iraqi
diplomats from Moscow.
   ``We would not want any steps that can aggravate the already hot
situation in the gulf, which will make difficult the way out of
that crisis,'' he said.
   He was asked whether the United States' action had aggravated
the conflict.
   ``I don't believe that we have to add fuel to the fire in this
explosive situation. Of course Iraq's actions to close embassies in
Kuwait are illegitimate. But if you use a tit-for-tat policy in
this question, you risk falling down the spiral of escalation, and
aggravating the situation.
   ``I believe we have to mostly make use of diplomatic efforts.''
   Asked whether the Soviet Union was being more helpful in efforts
to resolve the conflict, Gerasimov said: ``Diplomatically, yes,
because we talk to Iraq. You don't. But the aim is the same: to
stop this aggression, and to punish the aggressor.''
   A group of 240 Soviet women and children arrived in Moscow today
after being evacuated from Iraq. A second group planned to leave
either late today or early Wednesday, and all 983 dependents were
to be home by Saturday.
   The Soviet Union had 7,791 citizens in Iraq, mostly oil workers,
diplomats and dependents, officials have said.
   That number includes 193 military advisers, whom Soviet
officials say are under contractual obligation to continue working
for Iraq.
   Gerasimov denied accusations that the Soviet Union had violated
U.N. sanctions against Iraq by keeping its military advisers there.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's largest arms supplier, cut off weapons
shipments after the invasion.
   Gerasimov said U.N. sanctions did not cover the military
experts, who teach Iraqi soldiers to use modern Soviet-built
weapons. They also maintain and repair the hardware.
   ``Legally, there is no problem, but there is a moral aspect to
that problem, so we recognize that and will try to resolve it,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Banks Continue to Tighten Lending Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Reserve survey shows U.S. banks have
continued to tighten their lending standards in the last three
months because of a weakening economy and problems in several
industries.
   ``Domestic respondent banks indicated that since May they have
further tightened lending standards and terms with respect to
non-merger-related business loans,'' according to the survey
released Monday.
   It found that the tighter standards were particularly noticeable
for medium-sized firms, but also significant for small and large
businesses.
   The survey polled senior loan officers at 60 domestic banks and
18 branches of foreign institutions.
   ``Branches and agencies of foreign banks reproted that, on
balance, they too have moved to restrict the availability of
business credit,'' the survey found.
   ``By far the most important reasons domestic respondents gave
for tightening their credit standards in the last three months were
a less favorable eocnomic outlook and industry-specific problems,''
the survey said.
   Other reasons included more stringent money supplies due to
problem loans and regulatory pressures.
   ``About three-quarters of respondents reported that they had
imposed tighter credit standards for applications to finance
commercial office buildings in the last three months,'' the survey
said.
   Most banks reported their willingness to make general purpose
and consumer installment loans to individuals was unchanged.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledged in congressional
testimony on July 12 that credit problems were emerging. The
following day, the central bank lowered the federal funds rate from
8.25 percent to 8 percent in part to offset the tightened credit.
   The federal funds rate is that charged to banks for overnight
loans.

   Sen. Sam Nunn urged Egypt's president
today to send more troops to Saudi Arabia to show the world it is
with the United States in its showdown with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Sen. Bob Dole, the Senate's top Republican, and six
other Republican senators spent 90 minutes with President Hosni
Mubarak.
   The U.S. delegation is touring the Middle East. On Monday they
were in Saudi Arabia and met with some of the tens of thousands of
U.S. troops arrayed against Iraqi troops across the border in
Kuwait.
   ``Now that we have that deterrent force in place, I think we
need to get more Arab forces on the ground. I emphasized that to
the president,'' Nunn said of the meeting with Mubarak.
   ``I think it would help back in the United States with the
American people to see that we have more help from Egypt and from
other countries on the ground in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   Nunn said that would ``make it clear that it's not the United
States vs. Iraq but the Arab world and the world at large vs.
Iraq.''
   At a news conference after meeting the senators, Mubarak did not
mention Nunn's request for additional troops. He has said Egypt has
2,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia, but Egyptian military sources say
the figure is closer to 4,000.
   Mubarak and senior Egyptian officers say they would send more if
the Saudis ask for them.
   About 60,000 U.S. troops are in Saudi Arabia and the gulf
region, as well as dozens of fighter planes. Warships from the
United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and other
countries are in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.
   U.S. forces deliberately are being kept a good distance behind
Saudi and other Arab troops. Support for the deployment in the Arab
world might collapse if Americans fired the first shots in the
conflict.
   In addition, U.S. support for the deployment might waver if the
first casualties were Americans.
   Several senators said they came away from the military briefings
convinced a formidable deterrent force was in place.
   ``It's not all in place,'' Nunn said of the continuing U.S.
buildup. ``But an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia would be national
suicide.''
   Several senators conceded Iraq's holding of American hostages
complicated U.S. planning but said the hostage situation could not
be the driving force behind policy and military decisions.
   ``You can't run foreign policy on hostages,'' said GOP Sen. Jake
Garn of Utah. ``If you did, no American would be safe anywhere in
the world.''
   Other senators making the trip, all Republicans, were: Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, Steve Symms of Idaho, Alfonse D'Amato of New
York, Connie Mack of Florida and John Warner of Virginia.

<TEXT>
   The five permanent Security Council
members have agreed on a plan for a truce in Cambodia and U.N.
administration of the country, diplomats said today.
   The plan, which would involve the United Nation's deepest
involvement in any regional conflict, was worked out by the
American, British, French, Chinese and Soviet envoys in two days of
private talks on the details of a transitional administration to
guide Cambodia to peace and democracy.
   ``We have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members,''
said a U.S. diplomat involved in the talks. ``Now it is up to the
four Cambodian parties'' _ the Communist Khmer Rouge, its two
non-Communist guerrilla allies, and the Hanoi-installed government
in Phnom Penh.
   ``The question is, can the four Cambodian factions agree?'' he
said.
   Those factions are due to meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, in
September to indicate whether they will accept the plan.
   However, the agreement of the five permanent members means that
the backers of the warring factions _ the United States, Soviet
Union and China _ have reached accord on a peace plan.
   ``The question now is whether the Soviets and Chinese can bring
their people on board,'' said the diplomat.
   The Khmer Rouge receives its weapons and supplies from China;
the Soviets back the current Cambodian government of Prime Minister
Hun Sen, which was installed by their ally, Vietnam; and Washington
backs the two non-Communist guerrilla factions, led by Prince
Sihanouk and former Premier Son Sann.
   ``The United Nations will have very broad authority to
administer and to control Cambodia,'' said the diplomat, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``This will be the most significant U.N. involvement in this
(regional conflict) that we have ever seen,'' he said, adding that
it would far exceed the world body's role in guiding Namibia to
independence.
   The Namibia settlement cost the United Nations over $750 million.
   The key issues now, he said, were to organize a cease-fire and
elections so a new government can be established that is not
dominated by the Khmer Rouge or the current pro-Vietnam government.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to oust the Khmer
Rouge, who presided over the deaths of up to a million Cambodians
from starvation and executions during their brutal rule that began
in 1975.
   The five Security Council members said they approved five
documents that would be forwarded to the Cambodian factions by
France and Indonesia, the co-chairmen of the Cambodian conference
on adopting a peace plan.
   The Cambodian factions are supposed to meet to form a Supreme
National Council to represent Cambodia during the transitional
period. However, the respective roles and powers of the Hun Sen
government and the Khmer Rouge in the coalition have long been
disputed by the parties and their allies.
   The documents adopted today call for a cease-fire to be in
place; for the warring parties to disengage, disarm and settle in
U.N.-monitored ``cantonments;'' and for U.N. peacekeepers to take
over security on the ground.
   The United Nations would also organize elections and verify that
all Vietnamese forces have left Cambodia, as Hanoi announced they
had a year ago.
   The Cambodian guerrillas claim many Vietnamese troops remained
in the uniform of the Cambodian army, or as militias and civilian
administrators.
   The draft documents being sent to the Cambodian parties call for
the United Nations to ``supervise and control ... if necessary''
five key Cambodian ministries, various diplomats said.
   Those are the defense, foreign affairs, finance, public security
and information ministries. They would be administered for ``as
long as necessary,'' said a British source.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached To End Selma School Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight months of racial tension, protests,
arrests and lawsuits are nearing an end after blacks and whites
agreed to rotate control of the troubled Selma school system.
   ``I think we've got something good worked out,'' said Mayor Joe
Smitherman, who has been at the center of the controversy.
   The compromise announced Monday sets up a school board with 10
voting members, five black and five white, and a white chairman,
Carl Barker, who would vote only on litigation involving the board
and stemming from the protests.
   A resolution approved by the City Council on Monday calls for
the city to drop about 130 arrest cases against black demonstrators
who have camped out at schools and municipal buildings. In
exchange, protest leaders would agree to drop lawsuits against the
city.
   Once the legal wrangling is completed, Barker will resign and be
replaced by a black _ giving the 11-member board appointed by the
City Council its first black majority. From that point on, the
school board will be rotated racially, with a black majority one
year and a white majority the next.
   Selma schools reopened Aug. 20 after summer break, with blacks
now making up about 80 percent of the student body of 6,000. The
city of about 27,000 people is roughly half black and half white.
   The five black school board members walked out Dec. 21 after the
six whites voted to fire the city's first black superintendent,
Norward Roussell. The remaining board members continued to meet and
hired an interim superintendent, James Carter, who also is black.
   The five black board members will be on the new panel. One of
them, Freeman Walker, said he was looking forward to returning to
work.
   ``The war has been fought and the victors are the boys and girls
of our school system,'' said Walker, a teacher in the separate
Dallas County school system. ``I personally think the events of the
past eight months have strengthened our dedication toward our
responsibility.''
   Smitherman, who has carried the brunt of criticism by black
protesters, announced the school board agreement to a packed City
Council chamber that included one of the protest leaders, state
Sen. Hank Sanders, whose wife, Rose, was among those faced with
criminal charges.
   ``People have asked me how the board can operate with a
five-and-five split. Well, you're going to operate with the art of
compromise,'' said Smitherman, flanked by black and white school
board members and about 30 members of two black civic clubs that
helped negotiate the agreement
   The City Council approved the resolution by a 7-1 vote. The
first full school board meeting is scheduled Sept. 13.
   Smitherman spent hours over the weekend conferring with white
and black school board members, City Council members, black leaders
and even Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington, who called to offer
his assistance.
   Among other results of the racial tension, Gov. Guy Hunt sent in
the National Guard and state troopers in February, and about 300
whites transferried to Selma's two all-white private schools or
neighboring public systems.

   The U.S. Army's heaviest ground firepower
reached Saudi soil today for deployment behind Arab forces manning
the front line in the monthlong standoff with Iraq.
   Dozens of M1-1P tanks and M2 Bradley armored infantry fighting
vehicles, and scores more heavy support vehicles, rolled off two
huge transport ships at a port in northeastern Saudi Arabia and
were readied for the trip north into the desert.
   The M1s are by the far the biggest ground weapon in the
burgeoning U.S. arsenal in Saudi Arabia, weighing an imposing 60
tons and carrying a 105 mm cannon said to be accurate at 6,600 feet
or more.
   The huge but speedy tanks _ which can travel about 45 mph _ left
the 24th Infantry (Mechanized) Division's home in Georgia two weeks
ago.
   The 24th's heavy firepower will be deployed in front of most
other U.S ground forces in Saudi Arabia but still a good distance
behind the Saudi-led Arab forces, which are just miles from the
border with occupied Kuwait.
   The U.S. buildup _ which could reach 200,000-250,000 ground
forces _ is not expected to be completed until October. Transport
planes are arriving around the clock, but the M1s and the 24th's
other heavy weaponry have been long awaited by U.S. military
commanders. Until now, the U.S.-led multinational Saudi defense
force has been short on heavy ground firepower.
   ``This is boss,'' Sgt. Ronald Ruff said as he showed off his M1
to a group of reporters. ``This is the Cadillac model. This is the
top of the line.''
   Up to now, the only U.S. tanks in Saudi Arabia have been Vietnam
era M60s, brought by the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, and even
smaller M551 Sheridans. Iraq has a formidable force of Soviet-made
tanks, primarily the export versions of its T64 and T72 models.
   The T64 is comparable in armament and armor to the M1s that
arrived today; the T72 is equivalent to the more modern M1, the
M1-A1.
   The U.S. tanks are considered to have superior weapons sighting
and guidance systems, and the strategy for any tank war with Iraq
is to use the air superiority of the American, Saudi and British
forces to inflict heavy early damage on Iraqi tanks.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that we'll succeed here if we have
to,'' said Lt. Col. Barry Willey.
   ``Bring them (the Iraqis) on,'' Ruff said. ``We've the training
and technology; they've got the numbers. We'll take them out.''
   Several M1 crews said they will have to clean and change the
M1's filters more often because of the talcum-like sand of the
Saudi desert.

<HEAD>Man in Surrogate Custody Battle is Killed</HEAD>

   A man awarded custody of a child born to a
surrogate mother was found shot inside his ex-wife's apartment,
where he had gone to pick up the child, authorities said.
   Richard Reams died early today after undergoing surgery at a
Columbus hospital. His former wife, Beverly Seymour, was in stable
condition today at another Columbus hospital because of an overdose
of an unknown substance.
   Reams had been shot once in the abdomen, possibly with a
small-caliber handgun, when he was found late Monday afternoon in
Ms. Seymour's home, Sheriff Dwight Radcliff said.
   Earlier Monday, Reams won permanent custody of 5-year-old Tessa
Reams, who was the focus of a three-way court battle among Reams,
Ms. Seymour and the surrogate mother, Norma Lee Stotsky.
   Judge Ronald Solove of Franklin County Juvenile Court said Reams
was to pick up the child on Monday. Reams had temporary custody
before the ruling, and Ms. Seymour had visitation rights. Solove's
ruling allowed Ms. Seymour to continue visitation.
   The child was placed under the care of the Franklin County
Children's Services Monday night, said spokeswoman Kay Marshall.
   Tessa was born Jan. 12, 1985, to Ms. Stotsky, who was paid
$10,000 to be a surrogate mother for Reams and Ms. Seymour.
   Reams and Ms. Seymour were divorced a year later. As Reams and
Ms. Seymour fought for custody, Ms. Stotsky decided she wanted the
baby back.
   The biological father of Tessa is not Reams, but a friend of Ms.
Stotsky's who did not seek custody.
   Ms. Stotsky waged a campaign for custody in 1989 when Franklin
County Probate Judge Richard Metcalf indicated neither Reams nor
Ms. Seymour might be suitable to get custody.

<TEXT>
   A death row inmate has told authorities
he helped strangle a fellow convict with a jump rope in a prison
recreation yard, a sheriff's department spokesman says.
   Officials were questioning David Earl Gibbs, 29, convicted of a
1985 rape and murder, in connection with the death of death row
inmate Calvin J. Williams, Walker County Sheriff's Deputy Don
Hampton said.
   Williams, 30, was found near death Monday by prison guards at
the Ellis I Unit northeast of Huntsville near the end of a
scheduled three-hour recreation period. He died later at a hospital.
   Gibbs and Williams had been isolated in adjacent recreation
yards separated by a chain-link fence.
   ``It was clear from the way the rope was tied off, it was done
from Gibbs' side of the fence,'' special prosecutor David Weeks
told the Houston Chronicle. He said Gibbs had fresh scratches and
rope burns on his hands.
   Williams' death came one day short of the 10th anniversary of a
Harris County jury's decision to sentence him to lethal injection
for the rape-slaying of Emily Anderson, 28, the vice president of a
Houston travel agency.
   Williams, who came within 90 minutes of execution in 1988 before
winning a Supreme Court stay, had vowed he would never be put to
death without a struggle. He had a history of violence during his
years in prison.
   Williams, who was black, was a target of a homemade bomb during
a September 1984 attack blamed on prison racial violence. He
suffered burns over 17 percent of his body and also was stabbed and
one leg was broken.
   Williams, who said he was one of 19 children in his family, was
in the 11th grade when he went to jail on a robbery conviction. He
had been out 34 days when Miss Anderson, nicknamed Mimi, was killed.
   Miss Anderson's sister, Ellen Yarrell, was not upset Monday when
told of Williams' death.
   ``Apparently, he or someone else decided his time was up,'' said
Ms. Yarrell, a Houston lawyer. ``I have been upset with the
judicial system, even though I'm a lawyer, that his appeal process
has gone on so long. I still think he acted as Mimi's judge, jury
and executioner.''
   Williams acknowledged breaking into the apartment where Miss
Anderson was slain, but insisted the burglary occurred a month
before the killing. His fingerprints, however, were found in the
woman's stolen car, recovered a few blocks from his home.
   A jury took just six minutes to decide on the death penalty.
   Prison records showed he was involved in five fights within four
years and was cited numerous times for destruction of state
property.

   Some people think one Saddam is enough,
but Iraq's news agency says 25 couples in Yemen have named their
new babies Saddam since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his
army into Kuwait.
   The state-controlled Iraqi News Agency reported Tuesday that
enthusiasm for Saddam Hussein is running high in Yemen, whose
government has indicated sympathy for Iraq but maintained a
relatively neutral public stance since the Aug. 2 takeover.
   Yemeni parents' feelings are based on support for Saddam's
``national stand in facing foreign aggression against the Arab
nation,'' the news agency said.
   It did not say if any Yemeni newborns had been named George Bush.

   Two nurses who were to be paid by the
government to accompany a mentally disturbed patient on vacation
lost the man but went on the holiday anyway, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
   The patient, a 31-year old man being treated at the Beckomberga
mental hospital in Stockholm, had paid with his own money to travel
to Antalaya in Turkey. The government was to have reimbursed the
nurses for the cost of their trip, but officials said they probably
won't get the money now.
   But before the departure Saturday, the nurses lost track of the
man at Arlanda international airport, the Dagens Nyheter and
Svenska Dagbladet dailies reported. After an hour of searching, the
papers said, the nurses decided to leave for the holiday, taking
their patient's passport, ticket and money.
   ``He can cope by himself,'' the papers quoted the nurses as
having told worried airport officials before boarding the plane.
   Arlanda police official Jan Martensson said the man was found at
the airport and taken back to the hospital ``in worse psychological
condition ... than before.''

   A German woman who lost her lower legs in
a childhood accident has swum the English Channel, the Channel
Swimming Association said Tuesday.
   Lucyna Krayfusua, 28, of Dortmund, West Germany, crossed the
channel on Monday in 12 hours, 29 minutes, said Ray Scott, chairman
of the association.
   ``It was better than most. It's a very good time,'' said Scott.
``Of course, her arms are very very powerful.''
   He said the woman failed on two previous attempts to make the
21-mile crossing to France.
   The record time of 7 hours, 40 minutes was set by an American
swimmer, Penny Dean, in 1978.
   Ms. Krayfusua was part of a group of six who all completed the
crossing. Also in the group was Mosad Saad, 29, of Cairo, who has
one leg, Scott said. He finished in 13 hours, 32 minutes.

   Fire swept through a house where a smoke
detector had been installed last weekend, killing six family
members and severely injuring a seventh.
   Firefighter Michael Thompson said nothing could be done to save
the victims after the Oneonta Fire Department received the call.
``The house was already on the ground,'' he said.
   Thompson said fire officials were unsure how the survivor
escaped. ``He was pretty badly burned. He was out of the house,
probably 200 or so yards away from it.''
   State Deputy Fire Marshal James Epperson said he had not
determined the cause of the fire, but had ruled out foul play.
   ``There's not a whole lot left to work with,'' Epperson said.
   Owner Coy Carruth and his wife, Shirley, had already left for
work when the fire started early Monday.
   ``There was no sign of anything that I saw unusual,'' he said.
   Carruth said he had installed a smoke detector in the dining
room during the weekend and believed it was loud enough to be heard
in the bedrooms upstairs.
   Carruth identified the victims as his son Vincent, 24; his
daughter Shari, 19; his son Brian, 9; his daughter-in-law Renae,
age unavailable; and her daughters, Christy, 3, and Jennifer, 14
months.
   Renae Carruth's husband, Royce, 27, was listed in critical
condition at University Hospital in Birmingham.

   A man buried six puppies alive in his back
yard, which was dug up by a Michigan Humane Society worker who
heard whimpers from the dirt, police said Tuesday.
   A neighbor reported the burial to the society on Saturday.
   One of the mixed-breed puppies died; the others were in good
condition, authorities said.
   ``It's really quite amazing they've survived,'' said Debbie
McDonald, manager of the humane society. ``They apparently had been
buried for less than an hour.''
   McDonald said investigator Mike Killian found the puppies'
mother lying over the fresh graves. Killian dug at the spot and
found the pups about 18 inches down.
   ``The owner told him that he had buried the puppies because they
had all died, but as they got close to the burial spot, Killian
could hear them crying and whimpering under the dirt,'' McDonald
said.
   Richard E. Green, 65, faced arraignment on six misdemeanor
counts of animal cruelty, police said. If convicted, he could be
jailed for 90 days and fined $500.

   A military panel will hear the case of a
19-year soldier charged with unpremeditated murder in the shooting
death of a man during the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Master Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan pleaded innocent as his
court-martial began Monday. Unpremeditated murder carries a maximum
punishment of life in prison.
   At Bryan's request, the court-martial will be heard by a panel
similar to a jury instead of a military judge. Eight of 12 people
questioned were chosen to hear the case.
   ``I'm feeling good,'' Bryan, 42, said Monday after his
court-martial recessed for the day.
   The Army alleges Bryan shot the Panamanian man without
provocation on Dec. 23, 1989 _ three days after the United States
launched Operation Just Cause to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega.
   The shooting occurred after a Panamanian tossed a grenade that
wounded 10 82nd Airborne soldiers at a roadblock near Madden Dam,
authorities said.
   Bryan, an 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper, has said he was
performing his duty in the heat of battle.
   Defense attorney Mark Waple said publicity about the case is the
only reason it has gotten as far as a court-martial. The Army does
not want to face ``criticism from the media or Congress in the face
of a great deal of publicity'' about the case, he said.
   A story in the Army Times newspaper quoted unidentified Army
sources as saying Bryan turned his M-16 rifle on a Panamanian
prisoner attempting to surrender.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles International Airport has tried
everything from blowhorns to gunfire to get rid of pesky pigeons
and sea gulls that occasionally get sucked into jet engines, but
nothing seems to work.
   Now, the airport is calling in the feds.
   Airport commissioners hired experts from the Department of
Agriculture's Animal Damage Control unit _ pigeon killers as
they're known by some airport workers _ to eliminate birds of a
feather.
   ``We've run out of solutions. It's time to get some outside
assistance,'' said Mario Polselli, the airport's chief of airfield
operations.
   Bird ingestion, as aviators call it, can seriously hurt a
plane's machinery, forcing pilots to dump fuel over the ocean and
circle back for unscheduled landings.
   In the last year, three jetliners sucked birds into their
engines at the airport, costing the airlines thousands of dollars
in wasted fuel and time.
   Among the solutions being considered by the unit are paving over
fields where birds roost, plugging building holes so birds can't
make nests and cutting down trees that have seeds that birds like.
   And if all that doesn't work, the unit might also lay out
something called porcupine wire that is covered in needles or play
tape recordings of bird distress calls.
   Wildlife experts, who will spend about a year at the airport,
say they have a tough task ahead.
   ``LAX is going to be a real test because it's located along a
bird migratory route, but we should be able to make a dent,'' said
biologist Judy Loven.

   The bodies of a man and a woman were
found at a student apartment complex today, a day after police said
they believed the grisly deaths of three young women were linked.
   Law enforcement authorities said they didn't know whether the
fourth and fifth deaths were related to the earlier slayings. But
they said they were investigating the latest deaths as a possible
double murder, and state officials braced for that possibility.
   ``It looks like it's a part of a serial killer,'' state
university system Chancellor Charles Reed said today in
Tallahassee. ``It's a community problem. It's not just a university
problem. We are taking every precaution we possibly can.''
   There were no plans to cancel classes, but students were being
encouraged to stay on campus, Reed said. ``We think our campus is
more secure than the surrounding community right now,'' he said.
   Gov. Bob Martinez urged that young people avoid staying alone in
this college community, where fall classes opened Monday at the
University of Florida and nearby Santa Fe Community College.
   Alachua Sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann said the bodies of a man and
a woman were found together at about 8:30 a.m. at an apartment
complex near one where two bodies were found Sunday. Police set up
a command post between those sites and the spot about two miles
from where a third body was discovered early Monday.
   Martinez said authorities weren't speculating that a ``Ted Bundy
copycat'' serial killer was on the loose, but the governor said the
FBI and ``out-of-state experts'' are involved in the investigation.
   FBI agents joined Gainesville authorities Monday, and Martinez
dispatched the state police mobile crime lab to Gainesville.
   On the campus, the slayings stirred memories of Bundy. He was
executed in Florida's electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989, after
murdering dozens of young women, including two Florida State
University students in Tallahassee in a 1978 rampage he followed
with the murder of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Lake City.
   ``That's what we're all saying. It's another Ted Bundy on the
loose,'' Jana Walters, 18, a freshman from Longwood, Fla., said
Monday. ``Some sicko.''
   Adding to fears was the mysterious disappearance of Tiffany
Sessions, a 20-year-old UF student who vanished after leaving her
Gainesville apartment to go jogging on Feb. 9, 1989.
   Authorities have declined to give details on the bodies and the
possible links.
   The Gainesville Sun, however, reported today that the
mutilations of the bodies at the two separate apartments was the
apparent connection.
   Two of the victims, who shared a townhouse apartment, were
identified as second-semester freshmen Christina P. Powell, 17, of
Jacksonville and Sonya Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach. Their bodies
were found Sunday afternoon.
   Eight hours later, at another southwest Gainesville apartment
about two miles away, Alachua County deputies found the body of
Christa L. Hoyt, 18, a student at nearby Santa Fe Community College
and a full-time records clerk at the Alachua County Sheriff's
Office, the college's President Lawrence Tyree said Monday.
   ``The two crimes could have been done by the same individual,''
Gainesville Police Chief Wayland Clifton said Monday. ``The method
of operation in these cases are similar.''
   The Sun quoted unidentified sources as saying that Ms. Hoyt had
been decapitated and her breasts mutilated, while at least one of
the other victims had her nipples cut off.
   Police would not confirm the reports but feared more killings
were possible because of the gruesomeness of the slayings.
   ``I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that
anybody that commits homicide using mutilation is a pretty sick
individual, and it's somebody we want to get off the streets very
badly,'' said Spencer Mann, spokesman for the Alachua County
Sheriff's Office.
   The weekend slayings prompted parents to flood the university
and police with worried calls. More than three-fourths of the
34,000 students live off campus.
   University President John Lombardi and other officials spent
Monday trying to soothe the fears of anxious parents. The
university, which advised students to make reassuring calls home,
established a free phone bank because many students' telephones
have not yet been connected.
   The first two bodies were discovered after the parents of Ms.
Powell, trying to contact their daughter before fall classes
started Monday, had police open the door.
   One victim was nude and the other was partly clothed, said Lt.
Sadie Darnell, a Gainesville police spokesman. Ms. Powell's body
was found in the living room of their apartment, while Ms. Larson's
body was found in a second-floor bedroom.
   The body of Ms. Hoyt was discovered by Alachua County deputies
after she failed to show up for work, Mann said. He said there was
trauma to the teen-ager's body, but he refused to elaborate.

   Hurricane Gustav was taking its 105 mph winds
northward into the open Atlantic Ocean today after curving away
from the northeastern Caribbean islands, the National Hurricane
Center reported.
   ``Gustav continues moving northward. The only threat to land
would be only four days away in Bermuda,'' Ray Fagen, a
meteorologist at the center in suburban Coral Gables, said this
morning. ``We see a northerly course which would put it within 300
miles of Bermuda in four days.''
   ``But it's definitely not a certainty that Bermuda would be
hit,'' he added.
   At noon EDT, Gustav's center was located near 20.8 degrees north
latitude and 58.0 degrees west longitude, or about 390 miles
northeast of Antigua. It was moving northward at about 15 mph and
was expected to hold that course and speed for the next 24 hours.
   Meteorologists watching Gustav believe it's unlikely the
hurricane will turn towards the U.S. East Coast as it makes its way
north.
   ``The chances would be maybe one in 50. It's just the way the
steering currents are setting up. It'd be more likely to curve to
the northeast than to the northwest,'' Fagen said.
   Gustav's path skirted the Leeward Islands and hurricane warnings
there were dropped by midday Monday. All other storm warnings and
watches issued Sunday for the area were later dropped.
   But islands in the northeastern Caribbean could get rough seas
and swells during the day today, forecasters said.
   Gustav's hurricane-force winds this morning extended 35 miles
from its center, with tropical storm-force winds extending outward
175 miles.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Hortense remained about a thousand
miles to the east in the mid-Atlantic, a danger only to shipping.
   At noon Tuesday, Hortense, the eighth named storm of the
Atlantic season, had winds of 65 mph. It was moving north northwest
at about 10 mph.
   The storm was centered near 22.6 degrees north latitude and 44.1
degrees west longitude, or about 1,310 miles west-northwest of the
Cape Verde islands. Little change in its strength was expected for
the next 24 hours.
   Both Gustav and Hortense were born as tropical depressions near
the Cape Verde islands off West Africa, like many of history's
worst hurricanes.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
top winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.

   Thousands of university students danced
and clapped to the beat of anti-government slogans in heavy rain
Tuesday to protest a proposed job policy they say is discriminatory.
   In a separate protest, about 500 students from New Delhi's
medical colleges marched to Prime Minister V.P. Singh's house and
demanded the proposals be withdrawn.
   Singh announced this month that the government would reserve 27
percent of government jobs for ``socially backward'' castes. On
Monday, he said quotas also will be introduced for lower income
groups, irrespective of caste.
   Already, 22.5 percent of the jobs are held for lower castes and
tribes. If implemented, the new proposals would raise the
percentage of reserved jobs to between 54 percent and 59 percent.
The remainder would be awarded on merit.
   ``This has divided the student community. It has brought the
illegal caste system to the fore,'' said Ranjit Manchanda, a
student at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the
country's top medical college.
   Opponents also say the quota system would lead to the employment
and promotion of unqualified people and heighten caste tensions.
   Discrimination on the basis of caste is illegal. But in
practice, the four-tier Hindu caste system, which determines a
person's social standing, is widely prevalant in India, especially
in villages. The four castes are divided into hundreds of
sub-castes.
   About 85 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus, and
the high castes among the community hold the majority of government
jobs. They also are generally richer than the lower castes.
   Nationwide protests against the new quota proposals started
three weeks ago.
   In New Delhi, students have repeatedly enforced general strikes,
blocked traffic and damaged government-run buses during the past
week. Tuesday's downpour did not appear to have broken the tempo of
the protest.
   Demonstrations were largely peaceful in the morning. It started
raining after noon when the students of the medical colleges and
those of the Delhi University began their marches.
   The students stood in the rain for more than two hours,
chanting, ``V.P. Singh down! Down!'' and ``Who acts like Hitler
will die like Hitler.''
   The protest ended after some protesters commandeered city buses
for drenched colleagues. Others walked in the rain, and some forced
drivers of private vehicles and motor scooter taxis to take them
home. Mounted and riot police watched from a distance.
   ``Don't worry. We will fight to the last. If the government does
not listen to us, we know what to do,'' said a teen-ager,
brandishing a stone as he climbed aboard a packed bus.

<HEAD>With Crack in the Spotlight, Gang Made Millions Selling Heroin</HEAD>

   Crack gangs waging bloody turf battles held the
attention of many law enforcers in the late 1980s, while behind the
scenes one violent gang scenes made millions peddling heroin and
cocaine, authorities say.
   Jury selection begins Wednesday in the trial of what prosecutors
describe as the one of the city's most lucrative street-level drug
gangs.
   From early in 1986 until his arrest 2{ years later, Ricardo
Melendez and his followers built up a network that raked in as much
as $8 million to $10 million a month from some of Brooklyn's
poorest neighborhoods by selling drugs out of abandoned buildings
and storefronts, according to authorities.
   ``There used to be block-long lines of people waiting to get
their hands on this stuff,'' Detective Robert Alongi, an
investigator in the case, told the Daily News.
   When police and federal drug agents raided Melendez' apartment
two years ago, money was everywhere, they said _ 6-inch high stacks
of $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills spread across the kitchen floor.
   Some 300 pounds of cash was found in the apartment, totaling
$2.38 million.
   The trial, with some 150 witnesses, is expected to last as long
as three months.
   Melendez, 30, who is being held without bail, and his nine
co-defendants are charged with several drug conspiracy counts that
incorporate numerous drug-related slayings, kidnapping, tortures
and beatings aimed at maintaining discipline in the organization
and keeping out competing drug dealers.
   They face life in prison if convicted.
   Former Melendez employees and rival drug dealers will take the
stand to tell jurors how Melendez and his lieutenants yanked out
teeth, cut off fingers or broke bones as punishment for stealing
from the organization or selling drugs in its territory, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter R. Ginsberg.
   One witness says Melendez kept a ``souvenir'' jar filled with
teeth of victims he had tortured or beaten, authorities said in
court Monday.
   Alleged threats to prosecutors and to the families of anyone who
testified against Melendez prompted U.S. District Judge Arthur
Spatt to keep secret jurors' first names, addresses and their jobs
``to insulate them from improper influence.''
   Security was tight when the defendants, several of whom are free
on bail, appeared for final pretrial hearings Monday.
   Spatt, citing an account of Melendez' drug operation published
Monday in the Daily News, imposed a gag order directing prosecutors
and defense lawyers to not speak with reporters about the case.
   Melendez was first arrested on heroin charges in 1985. He jumped
$50,000 bail just before the start of his trial and was convicted
and sentenced in absentia to 25 years to life in prison.
   According to court records, his gang employed up to 100 people _
paying hourly wages to some low-level workers _ and his drugs sales
paid for luxury clothes, jewelry, gambling trips and Mercedes-Benz
cars.
   Defense lawyer Lawrence Hochheiser said that with the publicity
and the public frustration with drugs, defending Melendez would be
difficult in a case involving such violent crimes and such hugh
sums of money.
   ``Anyone in a narcotics case already has two strikes against
them,'' he said.

   A wildfire that killed two firefighters,
razed 19 houses and blackened more than 2,600 acres of timber and
brush defied control today, although its progress slowed, officials
said.
   Three hundred firefighters used aerial tankers, water-bearing
helicopters and bulldozers to cut fire lines in an all-out assault
on the blaze, which they expected to contain from spreading by late
tonight. Authorities said they hoped to have the fire under control
by Wednesday evening.
   ``Today's the first day we actually have the resources in place
to man the whole fire,'' said Gary Laing, the Interagency Fire
Management Team's operations manager.
   ``We don't have a stranglehold on it yet,'' added incident
commander John Shive. ``But we're going for its throat.''
   After completing an overnight survey of the fire, officials
today downgraded its acreage to 2,600 acres from earlier estimates
of 3,000 acres.
   Two firefighters died Sunday night when the blaze exploded in
size because of winds gusting to 60 mph. The victims were trapped
between advancing flames and a precipice.
   Wasatch County sheriff's Deputy Blake Wright, 39, and county
road crew worker Ralph Broadhead, 65, were found near the bulldozer
they had been using to cut a fireline near an area known as Devil's
Hole.
   Hundres of homes in the Wasatch Mountain area were threatened,
but the fire had to move downhill to advance, fire spokesman Dick
Buehler said. Flames move faster uphill.
   Smoke hung along the face of the scorched mountains west of
Midway this morning, as cool air created an inversion holding the
hotter air close to the ground. Afternoon winds were expected to
again fan the flames, however.
   ``It's asleep right now,'' Shive said of the fire. ``It'll
explode again. But this time we're waiting for it.''
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   State Forester Dick Klason speculated that it was sparked by an
ember blown over from a small fire near Cascade Springs. He
estimated the cost of fighting and cleaning up after the blaze
could exceed $3 million.
   Sheriff Edd Thacker said the two firefighters who died
apparently had tried to cut a buffer between themselves and the
fire. Investigators said temperatures rocketed to nearly 1,100
degrees in the area, melting the bulldozer's windows.
   ``They did what they were supposed to do,'' he said. ``It was a
firestorm. The fire was coming at them and they did the best they
could.''
   Wright was a 10-year law enforcement veteran with six children
and Broadhead was within weeks of retirement, Thacker said.
   ``It's going be hard on everybody,'' he said. ``We've known them
both for years. It's just awful.''

   Someone on a fishing excursion Tuesday with
President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney hooked a big one _
the president himself.
   Camera crew members in a news boat following close behind said
Mulroney appeared to be responsible for the hook that caught Bush's
ear, a notion the Canadian prime minister did nothing to dispell.
   ``It was not a hostile act,'' Mulroney said.
   However, first lady Barbara Bush, who said her husband ``is
fine,'' disputed that Mulroney was the culprit. She summoned son
Jeb, who was also on the boat, and commanded him to tell reporters
just who had hooked his father.
   Jeb just grinned sheepishly. Did Mulroney hook Bush? ``That is
really not true,'' he said and walked away.
   Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater later confirmed that Jeb
was responsible for accidentally piercing his father's right ear
lobe.
   Bush's physician on an accompanying boat attended to the wound.
He snipped the fish hook with wirecutters and pulled the remainder
of the hook through the ear, according to Fitzwater.
   ``The president was strong and courageous throughout this
exercise,'' Fitzwater told reporters traveling back to Washington
with Bush aboard Air Force One. Fitzwater said the hook passed
through the bottom, rounded part of the president's ear lobe.
   Bush continued to fish for about another hour and later received
a tetanus shot. When he boarded Air Force One later in the morning
no evidence of a wound or bandage could be seen.
   It was the second boating mishap involving Bush and Mulroney.
   On Monday, Bush's boat broke down while the president was taking
the Canadian leader and his family for a ride. A small Coast Guard
boat was summoned to rescue the party. The boat was fixed over
night.

   It may be time for the United States to open
avenues of trade with communist Vietnam and Cambodia as a prelude
to United Nations-sponsored elections in Cambodia, Sen. Richard
Lugar said Tuesday.
   ``We ought to sketch conditions for easing restrictions on
commerce with Vietnam and Cambodia,'' the Indiana Republican told
reporters.
   Developmental loans for Vietnam could be a first step, he said.
   Lugar just returned from a two-week, seven-nation trip to East
Asia. In Vietnam, he met with foreign minister Nguyen Co Thach, who
sought to highlight market reforms made in his country's economy.
   Thach assured him that all Vietnamese forces have been withdrawn
from Cambodia, where they had fought to push the feared Khmer Rouge
from power, Lugar said.
   Vietnam supports current peace efforts by the United Nations,
would accept any government installed in Cambodia through free and
fair elections, and would agree to continued non-lethal U.S. aid to
the non-communist resistance now fighting the Vietnamese-installed
regime of Hun Sen in Phnom Penh, he said.
   Lugar said he found a clear interest among American business
interests in Thailand, Hong Kong and Seoul in reopening commerce
with the two countries, and said other nations already are quietly
doing so.

<HEAD>Venus Mapping Delayed to Late September as Engineers Probe
Magellan Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magellan's mission to map the rugged
surface of Venus is being delayed again so a team of engineers can
figure out why the spacecraft keeps losing contact with Earth, a
NASA official said Tuesday.
   ``We're targeting for the last week in September to start
mapping,'' said Tony Spear, Magellan project manager at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Spear had said Friday that engineers hoped to fix the problem in
time to have Magellan working properly by mid-September. Before
Magellan started malfunctioning, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration planned for it to make pictures and maps of Venus on
a regular basis starting Sept. 1.
   The spaceship remained in a protective ``safing mode'' Tuesday,
Spear said during an interview.
   Engineers still haven't figured out why Magellan's radio link to
Earth failed for 14 hours starting Aug. 16 and for 17{ hours
beginning Aug. 21, he added.
   So Spear said he organized a ``tiger team'' of 40 engineers from
the laboratory and from Martin Marietta Corp., which built Magellan
in Denver, to determine what is wrong with the spaceship and fix it.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is to use radar to peer through
Venus' thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the
planet's surface. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on
May 4, 1989.
   Pictures made during an Aug. 16 radar test showed extensive
``Venusquake'' faults, vast flows of solidified lava, cinder cones,
a lava-filled meteorite impact crater and countless valleys and
mountain ridges on the surface of Earth's nearest planetary
neighbor.
   Spear said one major theory is that something went wrong when
Magellan entered orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. It functioned
almost flawlessly during the 15 months it traveled a looping path
of 948 million miles from Earth.
   Spear ruled out the possibility, raised Friday, that Magellan's
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft
after it went into Venus orbit.
   Mapping is being delayed not only because time is needed to fix
Magellan, but also because the spacecraft's troubles have left
engineers ``mentally and physically exhausted,'' Spear said.
``We've decided to give the team three days off around Labor Day.''
   Engineers want to make sure Magellan doesn't break down again
when mapping is in progress because ``it's not good for people's
hearts,'' he added.
   Spear, fully aware of NASA's problems stemming from temporary
grounding of the shuttle fleet and a severe defect on the Hubble
Space Telescope, appealed to the public to have patience with
Magellan.
   ``We're going to make it work,'' he pledged. ``Have confidence
in us. We have one of the world's best teams working on this
problem.''
   Spear said the tiger team is divided into four groups. One will
try to understand and fix the overall problem. The second will look
at the environment around Venus to determine if previously unknown
electrical fields or particles are disrupting Magellan's
electronics.
   The third group will examine changes on Magellan as it went into
orbit, including the possibility of short circuits in plugs that
once connected the braking rocket to the spaceship. The fourth
group will study a backup computer that helps point Magellan. Spear
said the computer ran amok during both loss-of-contact incidents.

   Saddam Hussein today visited foreign
families held hostage in Iraq and told them he was willing to
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with President Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Saddam said he was ``ready and prepared for direct talks with
Mr. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher. ... Let us have the debate between me
and them on television for the whole world to see.''
   Margaret Tutwiler, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington,
quickly dismissed Saddam's offer, saying: ``It's sick, and it
doesn't even deserve a response. Come on, there is nothing to
debate.''
   Mrs. Thatcher was visitng Finland today, but a spokeswomen in
Britain said: ``I'm not in a position to give an immediate reaction
except to say I don't think the position has changed ... The bottom
line is that he (Saddam) has to get out of Kuwait before any
discussion can occur.''
   The Iraqi president's meeting with several hostage families was
shown on Iraqi television and broadcast by Cable News Network.
   In its report on the meeting, the Iraqi News Agency said Saddam
also ordered that one unidentified British family be allowed to
return home.
   It was not immediately clear what countries the foreigners were
from, or when and where the meeting occurred.
   One woman with a British accent asked Saddam why he was using
children in ``in something they can't undersand.'' He gave a long
answer in which he repeated that his hand was forced by Western
troops massing in the region.
   He also complained that the international trade embargo against
Iraq was reducing food and medicine supplies in his country.
   Saddam said ``children will be undernourished'' and could become
ill and die. He said the cutoff of medicine could cause outbreaks
of disease.
   ``When food is cut off from a society then you're actually
choking the society to death,'' Saddam told one of the Western
hostages.
   As the broadcast began, Saddam was shown entering a large room
and greeting the Western families, shaking hands with men and
patting children on the head.
   Dressed in a brown suit and tie instead of his military uniform,
he smiled as he greeted the foreigners. He then sat down to make a
statement through a translator at his side.
   He told the families he knew that they were feeling restricted,
and ``If my family were in your place I would have the same
feelings.''
   But he said, ``Politicians are forced sometimes to take a
position that goes beyond what they see directly in front of them.
   ``If it had to do with human feelings towards you ... then I
would immediately say you should leave and go back to your
families.'' But he told them that their presence was needed to
prevent an attack.
   It was the second time Saddam visited hostage families in a
broadcast intended for Western consumption. He was widely condemned
for his first visit last week, which was seen as a crude attempt to
gain Western sympathy.
   In today's broadcast, he told the foreigners that although he
understood they were in ``a difficult sort of situation'':
   ``When we put the issue in a larger context... in the event of a
possible military clash (with) the armies that have come to the
area ... and if we suppose that your presence here in Iraq for this
period would prevent such a clash, then we would find ourselves in
a position in which we are forced ... to take the sort of decision
that we have taken.''
   Saddam has used the same justification in the past for his
detention of about 21,000 foreigners, including 3,000 Americans and
3,000 Britons, who were trapped in Iraq and Kuwait at the time of
the Aug. 2 invasion.
   British and U.S. officials say Iraq has moved more than 150
Britons and more than 60 Americans from Kuwait to strategic
locations for use as ``human shields'' against a possible attack by
the U.S.-led forces.
   The Iraqi leader made no mention in the broadcast of the British
family reportedly being allowed to leave.
   The Iraqi News Agency said that ``President Saddam Hussein
ordered that one of the British families be allowed to return to
their country as a generous gesture by his excellency on the
occasion of the family celebrating the birthday of its child,
Rachel.''
   The dispatch did not reveal the family's surname, although it
said the family ``expressed its great gratitude and appreciation.''

   Actress Rachel Ward retreated to Australia
after the film ``Against All Odds'' and produced two children,
giving her the most demanding role of her life.
   ``There isn't much time for anything other than raising them, is
there? That just about takes up all of your time, if you're doing

``After Dark, My Sweet.''
   She said 5-year-old Rosie and 3-year-old Matilda are a handful,
but the high-profile life of a celebrity doesn't appeal to her.
   ``I didn't really feel that that was particularly rewarding,''
she said. ``If you do that you have a chance to be in a lot of
movies and stuff. But just being in the movies ultimately isn't
enough.''
   Last year, she portrayed an overly materialistic wife in ``How

   Former President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, have returned to Minnesota to undergo routine physical
examinations at the Mayo Clinic, where he underwent skull surgery a
year earlier.
   The Reagans arrived at the Rochester airport Monday afternoon on
a private plane. Reagan waved to a small group of people gathered
at the airport, then police led them to their hotel in a motorcade.
   Asked how he thought President Bush was handling the Persian
Gulf situation, Reagan said: ``Fine.''
   Reagan, 79, lives in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles.
   ``Both President and Mrs. Reagan are feeling fine, and these
examinations have been on their calendar for several months,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement.
   Reagan was at the Mayo Clinic a year ago for surgery to remove a
pool of blood that formed on his brain after a fall from a horse.
The surgery was performed Sept. 8 and Reagan left Rochester Sept.
15.

   Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the
world's first successful liver transplant, was released from the
hospital Tuesday, four days after undergoing heart surgery.
   Starzl, 64, underwent a coronary artery bypass operation Friday
at Presbyterian University Hospital, where he has performed
hundreds of transplant operations.
   ``He's doing very well,'' said Dr. Bruce Wilson, Starzl's
cardiologist. ``He walked up and down the halls yesterday.''
   Wilson said Starzl probably would rest at home for a couple of
weeks before returning to work.
   In 1967 at the University of Colorado, Starzl performed the
first successful liver transplant. In 1981, Starzl began work at
Presbyterian University Hospital, which he helped make one of the
world's premier transplant centers. Last year, the hospital
performed more than 460 liver transplants and 210 kidney

<TEXT>
   Two Liberian rebels surrendered to
an African task force and said hundreds more want to give up but
fear reprisals from rebel leader Charles Taylor, the Ghana News
Agency reported Tuesday.
   The news agency, which has a reporter with the five-nation force
sent to Liberia, said the two rebels handed over their automatic
rifles and ammunition Monday.
   The rebels said other members of Charles Taylor's National
Patriotic Front were looking for an intermediary to help them
surrender.
   Taylor has opposed the intervention of the African force to end
Liberia's 8-month-old civil war. He accuses the force, comprised of
3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and
Gambia, of supporting President Samuel Doe of Liberia.
   Both Doe, and Prince Johnson, leader of another rebel army at
odds with Taylor's, have welcomed the task force.
   Rebels began their armed struggle on Christmas Eve, accusing Doe
of corruption and human rights abuses during his 10 years of rule.
   Representatives of Liberian opposition parties and church groups
met Tuesday in the Gambian capital, Banjul, to discuss ways of
ending the war, which has killed at least 5,000 people, including
many civilians. After meeting for several hours, those attending
voted to invite Taylor to come to Banjul for talks.
   Two months ago, Taylor's rebels appeared on the brink of winning
the war, but forces loyal to Doe blocked them on the outskirts of
Monrovia.
   Johnson, who had broken with Taylor, launched a surprise attack
on the city and took control of most of it. Doe remains in his
heavily fortified mansion.
   Taylor has sent emissaries to West African capitals to try to
arouse opposition to the force's presence in Liberia. Thus far only
one country, Burkina Faso, has issued an outright condemnation.

authorities. The American was reported to be a man in his mid-50s
who died of a heart attack.
   The department also disclosed that Iraq plans to expel an
unspecified number of Americans from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in
response to the U.S. decision on Monday to order 36 Iraqi envoys
out of the United States by Thursday.
   In addition, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was told that
unspecified restrictions will be placed on embassy funds,
department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, said Iraq's troop strength in and near
Kuwait has increased to 265,000 soldiers. ``There's been a general
trend in the past several days of these numbers increasing,''
spokesman Pete Williams said.
   The Pentagon also estimated the total costs of the Desert Shield
operation through the end of September at $2.5 billion, nearly
double the previous estimate of $1.3 billion. Williams said the
sharply increased costs can be attributed to the expense of calling
up reserve and National Guard forces, increased operations for
ships and aircraft and to increased fuel costs.
   As for the dead American, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said he
died in the Iraqi city of Basra and that his body would be turned
over to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
   The State Department, in a statement released this morning, said
it could not confirm the cause of death or the identity of the
American.
   Later, Ms. Tutwiler said the death ``underscores the barbaric
nature of Iraqi policy towards foreign nationals in Iraq and
Kuwait, and makes a lie of Iraq's claim that they are all well
treated and in no danger.''
   She said nine Americans have been taken into custody by Iraqi
authorities since Monday, bringing the total to 70 _ 48 in Iraq and
22 in Kuwait. She said reports have been received that more
Americans have escaped from the two countries but she had no
further details.
   In Baghdad, the press attache at the U.S. Embassy, Stephen
Thibeault, said that according to the Iraqis an American had died
in Basra, a southern port in Iraq. He said the 56-year-old man
apparently died of a heart attack, and was believed one of those
who had been detained by the Iraqis.
   Thibeault, in a telephone interview from Baghdad, said there was
no positive identification on the American ``because we have not
been given access to the American citizen yet. The Iraqi
authorities have said that they would allow us to participate in
any autopsy.''
   CNN said the man was one of the 63 Americans being held hostage
as ``human shields'' against any U.S. attack. It quoted U.S. charge
d'affaires Joseph Wilson as saying the man had been taken from
Kuwait to a strategic site in Basra.
   Meanwhile, 36 Iraqi envoys face a Thursday deadline to leave the
country, targets of what the State Department calls a measured
response to almost a month of ``blatant'' Iraqi misbehavior.
   A U.S. diplomatic message was delivered to Iraqi Ambassador
Mohamed Al-Mashat on Monday afternoon, serving notice that the
affected diplomats must be gone within 72 hours.
   The move was in retaliation for a series of Iraqi actions,
especially the ``illegal order'' for the closure of the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The department also restricted the remaining Iraqi diplomats
here to a radius of 25 miles from the Iraqi Embassy in Washington.
It said all Iraqi diplomatic visas will be switched to single entry
from multiple entry.
   Procedures for approving visa applications from private Iraqi
citizens also will be tightened.
   The 19 Iraqi diplomats permitted to remain in the United States,
including Al-Mashat, reflect the number of Americans accredited to
the U.S. embassies in Iraq and Kuwait.
   At a news conference at his Maine vacation home, President Bush
said the United States was ``trying to keep a reasonable parallel
in terms of numbers.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the ``measured'' steps were being taken in
response to the ``blatant disregard'' Iraq has shown for
international law, in particular the moves against the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait.
   Al-Mashat said outside the embassay that the expulsion order was
``unfair and unjustified.''
   ``We feel we have been victimized once more,'' he said.
   Among the Iraqis expelled are seven accredited diplomats,
including all those who deal with commercial affairs. Those
diplomats became expendable after Bush suspended all commercial
transactions with Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq had ordered all embassies in Kuwait to shut down by last
Friday, but the United States and a number of other countries have
defied the order.
   Since then, Iraqi authorities have cut off water and electricity
at the U.S. Embassy and are restricting all personnel to the
embassy grounds.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the reduced U.S. embassy staff in Kuwait has
enough food and water only to last several more days. Power is
being supplied by a generator.
   The United States has refused to close its embassy in Kuwait
because it does not want to lend legitimacy to Iraq's conquest and
subsequent annexation of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Need for Repeat Cesarean Deliveries Questioned</HEAD>

   A survey released Tuesday casts new doubt on
the old notion that women who have given birth by cesarean section
must always deliver that way.
   The survey of 2,213 physicians by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that 63 percent of women who
attempt vaginal delivery after a previous cesarean section succeed.
   ``Strides certainly have been made'' to convince women and their
physicians that vaginal deliveries are safe and successful
alternatives to repeat cesareans, said Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan,
secretary of the organization.
   But she said since about 42 percent of the patients in the
survey chose to have another cesarean, ``there is a need to further
educate women'' about the benefits of vaginal deliveries.
   Vaginal deliveries are less risky than cesarean sections mainly
because the latter is a surgical procedure, said O'Sullivan,
associate chairwoman of obstetrics at the University of Miami in
Florida.
   Also, vaginal births are less expensive and the patient spends
less time in the hospital _ an average of $4,334 and two or three
days compared with $7,186 and four or five days for a cesarean,
according to 1989 data from the Health Insurance Association of
America.
   The rate of cesarean deliveries rose from 5.5 percent of all
U.S. births in 1970 to 24.7 percent in 1988.
   But O'Sullivan noted that the increase from 1986-87 and from
1987-88 was 0.3 percent, the smallest rise in five years.
   Also, the rate of vaginal births after cesareans rose from 2.2
percent in 1970 to 12.6 percent in 1988, she said.
   O'Sullivan said the rate of repeat cesareans appears to be tied
to the age of the physician. Ninety-eight percent of physicians
under 40 said they encourage their cesarean patients to have
vaginal deliveries for subsequent births, compared to 84 percent of
physicians over 55.
   ``It takes a long time to change your practice pattern,''
O'Sullivan said, noting that some smaller hospitals still do not
offer the option of vaginal delivery to women with a previous
cesarean.
   As recently as 15 years ago vaginal birth after a cesarean was
not considered good medicine in the United States, though a
standard practice for years in many other countries.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the
largest professional organization for physicians in those
specialties, recommends that women who have had a low transverse
incision in a previous delivery and have no medical complications
should be encouraged to attempt labor and vaginal delivery in their
current pregnancy.
   A low transverse incision, which cuts into a non-contracting
portion of the uterus, is most commonly used in cesareans today. It
largely replaced what is called the classical incision in which the
contracting muscles of the uterus are cut and are more likely to
rupture in a subsequent labor.

   Stock prices were mixed on Wall Street today after rallying in
Tokyo and London, while oil prices were mixed in early New York
trading.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 10.64 to 2,600.99 as
of 2 p.m. on Wall Street after having changed direction several
times.
   But the broader market was moderately higher. Advancing issues
were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 7 to 6, with 769
stocks rising, 661 falling and 489 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Stock prices rose in cautious, light trading in London, where
the financial markets were closed Monday for a bank holiday. The
broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 39.7 points, or 1.9 percent.
   Tokyo's major index, the Nikkei Stock Average, gained 569.00
points, or 2.26 percent, following increases of 976 points Monday
and 428.13 Friday.
   Since the Middle East crisis erupted after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Nikkei index had lost a total of 6,239.87
points, or 20.23 percent, through Thursday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October-delivery price
of light, sweet crude oil was up 24 cents in midmorning trading to
$27.15 a barrel. But the prices of later contract months dropped.
   On Monday, the October contract dropped $4 to close at $26.91 a
barrel. Oil prices were bid down on the assumption that members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna
would agree to boost output to offset the shortages left by the
international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   The dollar, meanwhile, tumbled against the Japanese yen but was
higher against most major currencies.
   In midmorning New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 143.53
yen, down 0.70 from Monday's New York close. But it was up slightly
against the German mark and British pound.
   In London, the dollar was quoted at 143.10 yen and it was
slightly lower against the pound. But the dollar edged higher
against the mark, Swiss franc and most other currencies in Europe.
   Earlier, the dollar fell to 143.20 yen in Japan, down 1.60 yen
from Monday's close.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's weakness in Japan carried
over from a drop Monday in New York. Dealers said Japanese
investors were selling the dollar to buy the yen based on an
optimistic view of the chances for a negotiated settlement to the
Gulf crisis.
   ``Investors think there will be no war at least until
Thursday,'' when United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar reportedly meets with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz,
said Akiko Baba, a Bank of Tokyo dealer.

   The explusion of some Iraqi diplomats from
Washington could raise Persian Gulf tensions, the Soviet Union
warned Tuesday in the latest indication of the nation's reluctance
to match harsh U.S. measures.
   ``I don't believe that we have to add fuel to the fire in this
explosive situation,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov.
   ``Of course Iraq's actions to close embassies in Kuwait are
illegitimate,'' he added. ``But if you use a tit-for-tat policy in
this question, you risk falling down the spiral of escalation and
aggravating the situation.''
   The United States has ordered 36 Iraqi Embassy personnel to
leave Washington by Thursday and imposed travel limits on the 19
envoys allowed to remain.
   It has been unable to persuade its allies to expel Iraqi
diplomats from other capitals.
   The move followed Iraqi demands that foreign countries close
their embassies in Kuwait. The United States and several other
nations have defied the order. But the Soviet Union pulled its
diplomats from Kuwait, citing security reasons.
   Gerasimov said the Soviet Union had no plans to expel Iraqi
diplomats.
   ``We want to move with caution ... We have to be real
delicate,'' he said.
   Although the Soviet Union has joined the near universal
condemnation of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, it has urged less
confrontational measures against its longtime ally. The Soviet
Union was Iraq's top arms supplier prior to the invasion, but has
since cut off weapons shipments.
   The Soviet Union supported United Nations Security Council
economic sanctions against Iraq. Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze also joined U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
in an unusual joint statement denouncing the invasion.
   But the Soviets _ acting on a request from Iraq _ then delayed a
security council vote to authorize a naval blockade to enforce the
embargo. They also said they preferred diplomatic, rather than
military, efforts to resolve the crisis.
   Yet last week, the Soviets voted along with other members of the
Security Council to authorize the use of military force.
   ``We gave additional time for Iraq to have second thoughts,''
said Gerasimov. ``It was in vain, and so we decided not to prolong
it again.''
   Gerasimov also suggested some of Iraq's Arab neighbors have
failed to put enough pressure on Iraq.
   ``A lot depends on the Arabs themselves ... They can make
certain efforts to find a way out of that situation,'' he said.
   A group of 240 Soviet women and children arrived in Moscow on
Tuesday after being evacuated from Iraq. A second group planned to
leave either late Tuesday or early Wednesday, and all 983
dependents were scheduled to be home by Saturday.
   The Soviet Union had 7,791 citizens in Iraq, mostly oil workers,
diplomats and dependents, officials have said. That number also
includes 193 military advisers, who Soviet officials say are under
contractual obligation to continue working for Iraq.
   Gerasimov denied accusations the Soviet Union had violated U.N.
sanctions by keeping military advisers in Iraq. He said the
sanctions do not cover the military experts, who teach Iraqi
soldiers to use modern Soviet-built weapons. They also maintain and
repair the hardware.
   ``Legally, there is no problem, but there is a moral aspect to
that problem, so we recognize that and will try to resolve it,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Scientists Praise Owl Plan Bush Administration Opposes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent scientists praised a plan to
protect the spotted owl Tuesday that the Bush administration has
resisted accepting.
   Three of the scientists said they told a government task force
examining the plan that it is one of the best issued on a
threatened or endangered species.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan Jr. appointed the task force in June after the Fish
and Wildlife Service declared the owl to be a threatened species
throughout Oregon, Washington and northern California.
   They asked the panel to examine alternatives to the plan
authored by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas and other
government experts because they feared it would ban logging on
millions of acres of old-growth forests and cost thousands of
timber jobs by the end of the decade.
   ``They (the task force) asked us our opinion of the Jack Ward
Thomas report, whether we thought it was a sound piece of work, and
we said it had our unequivocal support,'' said Malcolm Hunter, a
University of Maine biologist and author of a book on forestry.
   John Teer, a former Texas A&amp;M biologist who heads the Welder
Wildlife Federation in Texas, said to further compromise the Thomas
committee's recommendations ``would be a travesty.''
   ``It is one of the best reports on an environmental issue that
has ever been issued _ much better than the average environmental
impact statement required by the Environmental Protection Agency,''
he said.
   Hunter, Teer and North Carolina State forestry professor Richard
Lancia said they told the task force about three weeks ago that the
Thomas recommendations are the minimum necessary to protect the
rare owl.
   The fourth scientist who appeared before the task force, Jim
Carr of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, could not be reached for
comment on Tuesday, but the other three said he agreed with them.
   ``This is a precedent-setting report in that the Thomas
committee has in effect been able, or been willing, to sacrifice
about half of the habitat to preserve the other half,'' said Teer,
past president of the Wildlife Society, a 9,000-member association
of professional biologists.
   The task force is scheduled to announce on Saturday its
recommendations to protect the rare owl while minimizing the
economic impact on the Northwest's timber industry.

   The Defense Department has nearly doubled the
estimated cost of the Desert Shield deployment of U.S. forces in
Saudi Arabia, putting it at $2.5 billion, a spokesman said today.
   The sharply increased costs, up from an earlier estimate of $1.3
billion, can be attributed to the expense of calling up reserve and
National Guard forces, increased operations for ships and aircraft
and increased fuel costs, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   Other factors include increases in the number of C-130 aircraft
in the gulf region and an increases in the number of aircraft
carrier battle groups deployed there, Williams said.
   The cost estimate includes $1.13 billion for the Army, $494
million for the Navy, $556 million for defense agencies and $300
million to account for the increased fuel prices.

<HEAD>Premier Cites Police Inaction in Blaze at Socialist Headquarters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andrei Lukanov on Tuesday
assailed police idleness at a fire that gutted the ruling Socialist
Party headquarters but said it may be ``the price we have to pay''
for avoiding clashes with protesters.
   ``There is no justification for me for this lack of efficiency
or passivity that was demonstrated by the forces of order,'' said
Lukanov, who has demanded a government probe of the Sunday night
blaze.
   Witnesses said police stood by for the first hour of the fire,
started by a small group of demonstrators who broke away from a
larger protest. Police eventually cleared a path for firefighters,
who found that many of their hoses had been cut.
   The fire has been condemned by both anti-communist leaders and
officials at the Socialist Party, the name adopted last year by the
former Communist Party. But the two groups traded charges about who
was responsible.
   Lukanov said the blaze would be investigated by police
authorities while a a separate probe is conducted by the National
Assembly.
   He said the government's ``policy of great restraint'' since a
November 1989 party coup could explain some of the inaction by
police at the fire scene.
   ``For a long time it worked,'' he said.
   On Nov. 10, 1989, longtime Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov was
toppled in a party unheaval reportedly led by Lukanov; former
President Petar Mladenov; and Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov.
   The headquarters fire ``is the price we have to pay for the
policy of avoiding open physical clashes between civilians and the
militia,'' Lukanov said.
   The Socialist Party won national elections two months ago, but
its popularity has fallen because of Bulgaria's deteriorating
economy. Many items are rationed or in short supply.
   On Monday, Socialist Party chief Alexander Lilov blamed the fire
on extremists among the political opposition. Addressing the
National Assembly on Tuesday, Lilov said he detected the
``beginning of neo-fascism'' and predicted political extremism
``may throw the country into civil war.''
   The Union of Democratic Forces, a 16-party opposition alliance,
denied responsibility.
   Some opposition figures have suggested the Socialists could have
started the fire in an attempt to discredit the protesters. Filip
Bokov, a member of the Socialist Party's Supreme Council, termed
the allegation ``preposterous.''
   UDF officials said they would look into reports that Konstantin
Trenchev, leader of the opposition Podkrepa labor federation,
issued an ultimatum before the fire for the removal of the red
star, the symbol of communist power, from atop the headquarters.
   ``If facts prove that Trenchev _ or in fact any other person _
contributed to Sunday night's events, we are of the opinion that
such a person has no place in the UDF,'' spokesman Stoyan Ganev
said.

<HEAD>Medicare Paperwork To Become Physician's Burden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The burden of Medicare reimbursement paperwork
will shift next week from patients to physicians.
   Many physicians who don't already submit reimbursement claims
for their elderly and disabled patients on Medicare see a clerical
nightmare ahead.
   But advocates for the elderly see the change as needed relief
from confusing and time-consuming paperwork that so confounds some
Medicare beneficiaries that they don't file for benefits they are
owed.
   ``The paperwork burden on Medicare beneficiaries has been
tremendous,'' said Horace Deets, executive director of the American
Association of Retired Persons. ``Now Medicare beneficiaries will
receive the benefits to which they are entitled without having to
deal with burdensome paperwork.''
   A Physician Payment Review Commission poll in 1988 found nearly
one in 10 Medicare beneficiaries did not file a Medicare claim for
at least one bill they paid that year. Most often they said the
forms were too complicated.
   These unfiled claims amounted to between $90 million and $130
million, the commission estimated.
   Most of the estimated 450 million Medicare Part B claims
expected to be filed this fiscal year will have been submitted by
physicians or medical suppliers, said Barbara Gagel, the government
official responsible for implementing the new provision.
   About 10 percent of the bills are submitted by patients
themselves, but Medicare officials do not know how many physicians
this represents.
   Congress approved the change in filing requirements last year
without much discussion, and some lawmakers now say it wasn't a
wise idea.
   Rep. Joe Kolter, D-Pa., who introduced a bill last May to repeal
the filing change, has received many letters from Medicare
recipients as well as physicians who oppose the change.
   ``We think it's an unnecessary burden on physicians,'' said Bob
Powers, Kolter's senior legislative assistant.
   ``We've gotten a lot of mail from Medicare recipients who are
insulted'' because they feel the provision implies that they can't
fill out the forms themselves, Powers said. ``They want to do it
themselves,'' usually because they can do it faster than a
physician's office staff can.
   Physicians will have up to a year to file claims, less than half
the time now allowed. Failure to file would mean $1,000 fine for
each violation.
   Doctors and suppliers cannot charge Medicare patients for
preparing and filing claim forms. But, as is the case now, they can
require payment from the patient at the time of service.
   Physicians generally don't foresee lengthy filing delays,
although they expect the added work will increase their costs,
forcing them to hire extra clerical help or buy computers to handle
the chore.
   ``This is one of those instances where someone is trying to fix
something that wasn't broken in the first place,'' said Dr. Joseph
F. Boyle, executive vice president of the American Society of
Internal Medicine.
   Dr. Norton J. Greenberger, president of the American College of
Physicians, the largest professional organization of internists,
said the change has a ``desirable goal'' of easing the paperwork
burden on patients. It also will encourage electronic billing and
could speed payments, he said.
   But some physicians see the change as ``further intrusion by the
government into their office practices,'' he said.
   Initially at least, the government will accept a bill filed by a
Medicare patient. When the beneficiary is paid, Medicare officials
will inform him or her that the physician is supposed to file
claims, said Gagel, an official of the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   The impact on physicians will vary from state to state. An
informal sampling by insurance carriers that process Medicare
claims suggests it will have the most impact in Oregon, where the
proportion of doctors who don't file patient claims was estimated
at about 30 percent, she said.
   Indiana and Colorado were next with 13 percent and 12 percent,
respectively. At the other end was Massachusetts, where nearly all
physicians already file Medicare forms for their patients, Gagel
said.

<HEAD>Quarterly Trade Gap Down; Analysts Forecasts Widening Deficits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States recorded its smallest
quarterly trade deficit in 6{ years in the spring, the government
reported Tuesday, but analysts forecast widening deficits in coming
months as the Persian Gulf crisis boosts America's foreign oil bill.
   The Commerce Department said the trade gap from April through
June narrowed a sharp 14.1 percent, to $22.6 billion, reflecting a
big drop in oil prices and a record level for U.S. exports sales.
   America's trade performance has been the one bright spot in a
generally lackluster economy this year and the Bush administration
had been counting on further trade gains to keep the country out of
a recession.
   However, since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, many private
economists fear that an economic slump is imminent as an already
weak U.S. economy succumbs to an oil-price shock that sends
inflation surging and reverses the trade improvement.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said he believed
a mild recession would begin in the October-December quarter and
last for two quarters.
   He forecast that the U.S. trade deficit would widen sharply in
the current quarter and the final three months of the year,
reflecting higher oil prices.
   ``The problems in the Middle East just added to the other
problems the economy was facing,'' Wyss said. ``Trade is going to
get worse before it starts getting better again.''
   Even though oil prices retreated somewhat Monday, the price of a
42-gallon barrel of crude on the world market still stands about 35
percent higher than it did Aug. 1, the day before Iraq's invasion.
   David Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, predicted that
the increase in oil prices would add between $6 billion and $7.5
billion to the quarterly deficit figure.
   Steinberg said it was too soon to predict whether the oil runup
will be enough to trigger a recession or simply leave economic
growth at a near standstill.
   ``Although this event is smaller than oil shocks in the past, it
comes at a time when the economy was already quite weak,''
Steinberg said.
   The $22.6 billion trade deficit in the third quarter was down
$3.7 billion from a first quarter gap of $26.3 billion. It was the
lowest quarterly imbalance since a $21.3 billion shortfall in the
last three months of 1983.
   In the second quarter, U.S. imports fell 2.6 percent to $119.32
billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion, with a big $3.5 billion
drop in the foreign oil bill being partially offset by a $300
million rise in non-oil imports.
   U.S. exports were up $480 million to a record level of $96.7
billion, besting the old mark of $96.3 billion set in the first
three months this year.
   The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports.
   Tuesday's report on merchandise trade calculated on a
balance-of-payments basis confirmed trends noted in the
department's monthly trade reports, although the figures were
slightly different because the quarterly report excludes military
sales by the U.S. government and makes other minor adjustments.
   Petroleum imports, which had risen sharply in the first quarter,
fell by 22 percent, to $12.1 billion. The average price per barrel
decreased to $15.81, down from $19.47 in the first quarter.
   The import volume decreased as well in the second quarter to
8.41 million barrels, down from 8.9 million barrels in the first
quarter.
   While the price of oil surged to nearly $32 per barrel last
week, it was trading at around $27 per barrel Tuesday.
   The small rise in U.S. export sales came from higher
manufacturing exports offsetting a drop in farm sales. Non-farm
exports rose by $1.1 billion with increases recorded for automotive
products, consumer goods and civilian aircraft.
   Agricultural exports fell 6 percent, to $10.3 billion, with
wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton sales all declining.
   As usual, the biggest imbalance occurred with Japan, a deficit
of $10.4 billion, up slightly from a $10.3 billion first quarter
deficit.
   The United States posted a rare $1.5 billion second quarter
surplus with Western Europe, up from a $400 million surplus in the
first quarter.
   Analysts predicted the surpluses with Western Europe would
continue, in part because the U.S. dollar has been declining in
value in relation to the West German mark. A weaker dollar makes
U.S. products more competitive.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev beefed up his press
office Tuesday by naming a well-respected Soviet magazine editor as
his personal assistant and chief spokesman.
   Vitaly N. Ignatenko was slated to give his first press briefing
in the newly influential post Wednesday. He is editor of the New
Times magazine, which under his stewardship has played a
significant role in Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness.
   Ignatenko is expected to play a larger role in policy-making
than either his predecessor, Arkady Maslennikov, or his American
counterpart, Marlin Fitzwater.
   Ignatenko, 49, who speaks some English, is one of a handful of
top Soviet journalists who reputedly have enjoyed regular access to
Gorbachev and gained his confidence.
   One sign of his influence is his title: assistant to the
president and head of the presidential press service. The assistant
to the president designation is new.
   Maslennikov, whose performance was widely viewed as lackluster,
has returned to his former position as press aide to the chairman
of the Supreme Soviet legislature. He was on vacation and could not
be reached for comment.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, who
announced the changes at a news conference, said Maslennikov would
begin working for Anatoly Lukyanov, Gorbachev's successor as
Supreme Soviet chairman.
   Gerasimov himself was the top Soviet spokesman until he was
pushed out of the limelight when Gorbachev elevated Maslennikov.
   Maslennikov developed a reputation among both Soviet and foreign
reporters in Moscow for being difficult to reach and not returning
phone calls. He also made some high profile mistakes _ such as
failing to put down a rumor about Gorbachev's health during his
June summit meeting with President Bush.
   Asked at a press conference in Washington whether it was true
Gorbachev planned to undergo testing for diabetes in Minnesota,
Maslennikov replied that there were many scientific experts in
Minnesota with whom the Soviet leader might consult. His answer
allowed the rumor to live for several hours before being firmly
denied by other Soviet officials.
   Ignatenko has a reputation for accessibility and clarity.
   ``He is easygoing, with a very good sense of humor,'' said his
deputy at Novoye Vremya (New Times), Aleksandr Pumpyansky. ``But
he's also a professional journalist whose language is very precise
_ he knows all the nuances.''
   Born in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Ignatenko graduated from
the journalism department of Moscow State University and worked for
15 years at Komsolskaya Pravda, the Communist Youth League
newspaper, rising from cub reporter to deputy editor in chief.
   In 1975, he switched to Tass, the official Soviet new agency,
where he served as deputy general director 1978. He then worked for
the Communist Party Central Committee, serving as deputy chief of
its international information department until being named editor
of New Times four years ago.
   The weekly magazine, which is published in Russian and several
other languages, including English, has published articles critical
of the Soviet military and some of its allies, such as Cuba. This
summer it carried a revisionist history of the Korean War, laying
considerable blame on the North Korean side for the first time.

   Cowboys and golfers can phone home these
days without getting off their horses or out of their golf carts.
   And the convenience will be extended soon to bikers and boaters.
   It's all part of a program launched by Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co. this summer to make things easier for people on the
go.
   For starters, the company has installed three pay telephones, 80
inches off the ground, at the Lazy E Arena near Guthrie, the
world's largest, privately owned indoor rodeo arena. The height is
perfect for mounted cowboys, who are beckoned by ``Phone From
Horse'' signs.
   At Westwood Park Golf Course in Norman, golfers can drive right
up to a phone near the 15th tee to take or make calls. That phone
is 50 inches off the ground _ just right for someone seated in a
golf cart.
   The state's first Phone From Bike will be installed next week
along the Arkansas River in Tulsa, phone company officials said.
Bikers can talk in comfort on the 50-inch high phone without
resorting to a kickstand.
   In addition, the company plans to install 36-inch high phones
soon at docks at one or two Oklahoma lakes so boaters can make
calls without disembarking.
   The phone company has long been offering roadside telephones
suited for people seated in their cars, but the new phones for
sporting people are unique to Oklahoma for now, said Dennis Smiley,
a Southwestern Bell spokesman.
   ``It's kind of what you call grass roots ingenuity or employee
innovation. This is where the idea originated so this is where it's
starting,'' Smiley said, adding that other state divisions of St.
Louis-based Southwestern Bell could adopt the program if they like
it.
   ``It comes down to basic customer interest and economy. If
people start using phones from cars and boats and golf carts ... I
guarantee it will spread,'' he said.
   Sue Ball, the phone company's marketing manager, predicts the
best success from the golf course telephones. ``I really expect it
to take off big. And I really wouldn't be surprised if the Phone
From Boat isn't popular, too,'' she said.
   The first phones for people on the go were at the horse arena
and were installed at the suggestion of a contractor.
   ``It went over so big we started thinking of all kinds of
transportation people have, and tried to adapt our signs,'' Ms.
Ball said.
   She expects to hear any day now from Oklahoma City officials
about permission for the first Phone From Boat installation at Lake
Hefner.
   If that works, she plans a second one at Grand Lake in
northeastern Oklahoma.
   ``Obviously Oklahoma has people on the move. People don't sit
around with their feet up all weekend. A lot of the times they
spend that time mobile, pursuing recreational interests. But they
want to have access,'' Smiley said.

<HEAD>Police Bar Rally; Activists Allege Harassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-democracy activists accused the ruling
party Tuesday of harassment after police refused to give them
permission to hold a mass rally this weekend.
   Vernon Mwaanga, a spokesman for pro-democracy campaigners,
charged that ruling party officials have intimidated opposition
supporters. He said ``thugs and hooligans'' tore down posters
announcing upcoming rallies.
   Mwaanga described the postponement of Saturday's rally as an
attempt to frustrate the opposition campaign for a multiparty
democracy in this one-party state. The rally was rescheduled Sept.
8.
   Mwaanga said heads of the Frontline African states bordering
South Africa are to meet in Lusaka on Saturday and police said they
did not have the manpower to supervise both events simultaneously.
   ``It has been a consistent feature of our campaign that the
authorities have frustrated our efforts to hold meetings,'' Mwaanga
said.
   In a separate press statement Tuesday, Arthur Wina, chairman of
the National Interim Committee for Multiparty Democracy, said he
was disappointed that the government ``continued to operate on the
basis of giving priority to foreign and international images rather
than domestic affairs and national welfare.''
   Earlier Tuesday, a longtime political associate of President
Kenneth Kaunda said he would aggressively campaign to end one-party
rule.
   Legislator Humphrey Mulemba, a former ruling party
secretary-general, told reporters in Lusaka the scrapping of the
one-party system was vital for the future well-being of Zambia, one
of Africa's poorest nations.
   ``It is time we had political structural changes by removing
one-party and introduce multiparty politics in Zambia,'' he said.
   As secretary-general of the ruling party for four years, Mulemba
was No. 2 in the party hierarchy after Kaunda.
   He is the second ruling party legislator to openly attack
one-party rule.
   ``With immediate effect I am going public and I am appealing to
all Zambians for support,'' he said.
   Kaunda imposed a one-party system in 1973, when his ruling
United National Independence Party became the only legal political
organization in Zambia.
   Mulemba blamed one-party rule for ``inertia, corruption and lack
of competition.''
   On Monday, Frederick Chiluba, head of the powerful Zambia
Congress of Trade Unions made his strongest attack yet against the
ruling party.
   Addressing pro-democracy supporters, Chiluba accused Kaunda of
being a dictator and criticized the ruling party for being out of
touch with the people.
   A referendum on the political future of Zambia is scheduled Aug.
13, 1991.

<HEAD>Budget Crisis Threatens USDA Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Agriculture Department workers would be
laid off if Congress and the White House fail to solve the
government's budget problems, a report showed Tuesday.
   There would be lower subsidies for major commodities, and needy
farmers would have less of a chance to get housing and operating
loans, the report said.
   Perhaps as many as 90,000 employees, roughly 90 percent of the
department's permanent work force, would be affected one way or
another by the layoffs.
   It would affect chicken inspectors and economists, scientists
and file clerks, highly paid executives and those at the bottom of
the scale, the report warned.
   Layoff notices have been sent out to 2.4 million federal
employees in case Congress and the Bush administration don't come
up with an 11th-hour rescue for the fiscal year that will begin
Oct. 1.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, an
across-the-board cut of federal spending has been ordered by the
White House to begin Oct. 15 if no budget agreement is reached.
   About $22.9 billion of USDA's projected outlays would be
affected. Food stamps and child nutrition programs generally are
exempt from the cuts.
   The USDA study anticipates cuts of 31.9 percent, or $7.3 billion
from affected programs.
   ``Farm price support payments and many other USDA loan and grant
programs would be severely reduced,'' the report said.
   The report added: ``The necessity to lay off employees would
disrupt USDA services throughout the world and especially at USDA
county offices throughout rural America. Producers and industries
dependent on the availability of USDA programs and services would
be severely affected.''
   For example, so-called deficiency payments to farmers for next
year have been projected at about $3 billion, and a 31.9 percent
cut would be more than $900 million.
   Dairy farmers would be assessed approximately 8.7 percent per
100 pounds of milk marketed, which would reduce cash receipts by
nearly $130 million.
   In state and county offices of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, where the programs are
administered, salaries and expenses would be reduced by the same
percentage. More than 20,300 employees of the county offices would
be furloughed. Offices would be closed Mondays and Fridays.
   Stephen B. Dewhurst, the department's budget director, said he
and others in the office had received letters that they would be
furloughed three days out of every 10.
   ``You can get a 50-50 bet, I suppose, from people who think it
won't happen at all and those who think (cuts) will be 40
percent,'' Dewhurst said.
   The Office of Management and Budget has already boosted its
estimate of spending cuts to 32.4 percent, and Dewhurst said that
could balloon further.
   Only about $600 million of the $23 billion in food programs
would be subject to the cuts.
   Food stamps alone account for around $16 billion or so. But the
current food stamp law runs out in 1991.
   ``If, as everybody expects, the food stamp program is
reauthorized, it will drive federal spending up,'' Dewhurst said.
``You'd see the (cuts) go to somewhere between 38 and 40 percent.''
   That would put a further bite on commodity price support
operations, the Farmers Home Administration, food aid to foreign
countries, conservation, research and the other eligible programs.

   Thousands of people who bought Magic
Chef microwave ovens, thinking they were new, would collect $35
each under a proposed settlement of three lawsuits against the
manufacturer.
   Since January 1987, Maytag Corp.'s Anniston plant repackaged or
reconditioned ovens that customers had returned. The company then
sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160.
   Maytag denied any liability in the settlement proposal filed
Monday, but agreed to halt the practice and offer refunds to the
45,000 to 50,000 customers nationwide who bought the ovens. The
refunds would be cash payments of $25 and a $10 certificate toward
the purchase of a Magic Chef product.
   Maytag also agreed to pay up to $300,000 to the parties filing
the suits: the Alabama attorney general's office and a Birmingham
law firm.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert B. Propst gave initial approval
to the terms and set a hearing for Oct. 19 to allow any of the oven
buyers to voice objections.
   Dennis Wright, chief of the attorney general's consumer
protection division, said Maytag will send notices to customers who
mailed in their warranty cards and will purchase ads in newspapers
in cities where the ovens were sold.

   President Saddam Hussein announced today
that all women and children foreigners in Iraq are free to leave
the country on Wednesday, the Iraqi News Agency said.
   In a decree issued Tuesday, Saddam said ``that all women and
children who are foreigners in Iraq are allowed to move freely in
Iraq or to travel whenever they want starting tomorrow, including
the families Iraq is hosting,'' according to the news agency. The
report was monitored in Nicosia.
   It was not immediately clear how many women and children there
are among the 500 American hostages in Iraq. It also was not known
if the decree would apply to the 2,500 American hostages in Kuwait.
Baghdad, whose troops overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, now considers its
oil-rich neighbor part of Iraq.
   The announcement followed a televised meeting Saddam held with a
group of foreign families earlier Tuesday.
   During the meeting, a woman with a British accent asked Saddam
why he was using foreign children ``in something they can't
understand.''
   The Iraqi president gave a long answer in which he repeated that
his hand was being forced by the Western troops massing in the
region. Iraq has moved some of the hostages to military sites to
prevent an attack on them.
   But the Iraqi News Agency report on Saddam's decree said it was
issued because of the concern expressed by the foreign families
about their children during the meeting Tuesday with the foreign
hostages.
   The report said the fate of the foreign women and children is
now a humane issue that transcends the earlier reason for holding
them as hostages.
   During the meeting with the foreign families, Saddam also said
he was willing to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with President
Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Saddam said he was ``ready and prepared for direct talks with
Mr. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher. ... Let us have the debate between me
and them on television for the whole world to see.''
   The United States quickly rejected the offer. A spokeswoman for
Mrs. Thatcher repeated the firm policy of Britain and the United
States that Iraq must withdraw its troops from Kuwait before talks
can begin.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today said women and children
foreigners can leave the country and he was ready for direct talks
with President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   In other developments, Baghdad tightened its grip on Kuwait by
declaring it a 19th province and an American civilian died in Iraq,
apparently one of 63 Americans who were rounded up for use as human
shields against attack.
   Saddam issued a decree ``that all women and children who are
foreigners in Iraq are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel
whenever they want starting tomorrow, including the families Iraq
is hosting,'' the Iraqi News Agency said, in a report monitored in
Nicosia.
   About 500 Americans are being held captive in Iraq. It was not
know if the decree applied to the 2,500 American hostages in
Kuwait. Baghdad, whose troops overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, now
considers its oil-rich neighbor part of Iraq.
   Saddam offered to meet with Bush and Mrs. Thatcher while
visiting with several foreign families held hostage in Iraq. The
meeting was shown on state-run Iraqi TV and was Saddam's second
televised meeting with hostages.
   The Iraqi president said he was ``ready and prepared for direct
talks with Mr. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher. ... Let us have the debate
between me and them on television for the whole world to see.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
quickly dismissed Saddam's offer, saying: ``It's sick, and it
doesn't even deserve a response. Come on, there is nothing to
debate.''
   A spokeswoman for Mrs. Thatcher said Britain was unlikely to
agree to talks unless Iraq withdraws its troops from Kuwait.
   The nationalities of the foreigners shown with Saddam today were
not known. One woman who asked a question spoke with a British
accent and another indicated he was from France.
   It also was know known when or where the meeting occurred, but
the Iraqi News Agency said Saddam used the meeting to free one
British family and order that it be sent home.
   Saddam said he understood the families felt restricted, but that
Iraq needed to hold them to prevent an attack by U.S.-led forces
sent to the gulf to prevent Iraqi troops that overran Kuwait from
invading Saudi Arabia.
   Last week, Saddam was shown meeting with foreign hostages on
Iraqi television, patting the heads of small boys and posing for a
group photograph. The broadcast was sharply criticized by world
leaders who demanded that he let the foreigners go and stop using
them for propaganda purposes.
   Earlier today, shipping sources said U.S. Navy warships
enforcing the U.N. embargo against Iraq stopped two cargo ships and
crewmen boarded one in the Gulf of Aqaba before allowing them to
proceed to Jordan.
   It was believed to be the first time a ship was boarded and
inspected by the U.S. Navy since the embargo began shortly after
Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Also today, the Soviet Union criticized the United States for
expelling Iraqi diplomats from Washington, and warned that such
action could lead to a ``spiral of escalation'' in the conflict.
   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov also indicated
that some of Iraq's Arab neighbors have failed to put enough
pressure on Baghdad in response to its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The developments came as U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said he was intervening with Iraq to try to defuse the gulf
crisis.
   President Bush said he was pessimistic about the U.N. initiative.
   The peace effort, however, was enough to make stock markets
rally in Tokyo and London. Stock prices slipped slightly on Wall
Street.
   Gold, whose value increases in times of turmoil, plunged about
$19 to $392.55 an ounce today on London's gold exchange. Oil prices
also fell.
   In Vienna, 10 of the 13 OPEC ministers tentatively backed a deal
that would permit increased oil production by Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and some other nations to help offset losses arising from
the gulf crisis.
   But the ministers delayed until Wednesday a formal meeting
expected to give final approval to the agreement until messages had
been sent to Iraq and Libya, whose representatives did not attend
the meeting.
   In Baghdad, the press attache at the U.S. Embassy, Stephen
Thibeault, said that according to the Iraqis an American had died
in Basra, a southern port in Iraq. He said the 56-year-old man
apparently died of a heart attack, and was believed one of those
who had been detained by the Iraqis.
   Saddam has said he is rounding up Westerners and placing them at
key military and civilian installations as protection against an
attack by the U.S.-led multinational force deploying in the gulf
region.
   Thibeault, in a telephone interview from Baghdad, said there was
no positive identification on the American ``because we have not
been given access to the American citizen yet. The Iraqi
authorities have said that they would allow us to participate in
any autopsy.''
   Asked about life in Baghdad, Thibeault said: ``The American
diplomats here, as of this moment, are being accorded the same
diplomatic priviliges that we've had over the last few months.''
   Asked if the atmosphere in Iraq worries him, he said:
   ``Nothing specific other than being in a country where people
are not allowed to travel freely and leave the country. I think
that any thinking person would be concerned about those
circumstances.''
   Meanwhile, 52 dependents of U.S. diplomats who were evacuated
from the American Embassy in Kuwait arrived in Paris today on their
way home from Turkey. Three young men from the group were not
allowed to leave Iraq.
   A furious United States, saying Iraq had ``once again reneged on
its pledge'' that all the dependents could go free, swiftly ordered
36 Iraqi Embassy staff members in Washington expelled from the
United States and imposed travel limits on the 19 envoys allowed to
remain.
   ``I talked to the doctors. Everyone was in great shape,'' said
U.S. Embassy spokesman Paul Kozelka, who met with some of the tired
Americans at Charles de Gaulle-Roissy airport before the plane
continued on to the United States.
   The State Department said Monday it could not confirm U.S. media
reports that Iraqi ship captains had been ordered not to resist if
their vessels are stopped and searched by warships enforcing the
U.N. embargo.
   But Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohammed Sadiq
al-Mashat, seemed to confirm the reports in an interview on ABC's
Nightline.
   ``We are doing our best ourselves to defuse the tension _ I
mean, the order that we have given to the captains of the ship not
to resist...'' he said.
   The London-based Lloyd's shipping agency, which monitors
maritime traffic worldwide, said the U.S. Navy boarded the
Greek-owned container ship Zorba Express and stopped the Indian
owned vessel Kalidas on Monday near the mouth to the Gulf of Aqaba.
Both ships were allowed to proceed when the Navy determined the
cargoes were not bound for Iraq.
   Diplomats and shipping executives said that previously, the U.S.
Navy simply radioed ships demanding to know their nationality,
cargo and destination. However, the U.S. Navy also fired warning
shots across the bows of two Iraqi tankers early in the crisis.
Both refused to stop.
   Lloyd's also said that on Sunday the U.S. Navy denied the French
container ship Paris entry into the Gulf of Aqaba.
   Iraqi newspapers today published Saddam's decree turning Kuwait
into an Iraqi province. The newspapers did not say when he issued
the decree, which created the province of Kuwait. Iraq's
longstanding claim to Kuwait is based on the fact that during the
Ottoman Empire Kuwait was part of the Basra governate and the
British split it up after World War I.
   In Washington, the White House condemned Iraq for making Kuwait
a province. ``The reaction is quite obvious,'' said spokesman Roman
Popadiuk. ``The annexation is null and void. The whole United
Nations has spoken on it. And that's it.''

   After five years in Kuwait, Ray Shoopman had finally glimpsed
the day when every spare penny wouldn't have to be reinvested in
his fledgling construction company. What he didn't see was Iraq's
Saddam Hussein on the horizon.
   ``Within a matter of a few hours, it all changed,'' Shoopman
said Tuesday. ``We had no intentions of leaving when we did. (But)
when you're in a position like that ... you're ready to leave
everything behind.''
   For the American families who abandoned their adoptive homes in
the Middle East, the past weeks are frighteningly fresh and the
immediate future painfully uncertain. They are feeling their way
tentatively beyond disorientation.
   Instead of building up his business, Shoopman is picking up the
pieces. In the scramble to escape occupied Kuwait, the 50-year-old
instructed his family to pack only essentials: water, a change of
clothes, birth certificates.
   He, his wife, daughter and two grandchildren arrived in Alabama
on Aug. 24 with little more than a suitcase each _ and 60 days to
repay a $10,000 emergency loan from the U.S. government.
   ``Repatriation loans are made to destitute Americans ... for a
one-way ticket home,'' said Aleta Wenger, a State Department
spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
   ``Arrangements are made to pay that amount of support back ...
and until they complain that they can't pay it back within 60 days,
there's no real reason to be flexible,'' she said. ``It's a
wait-and-see kind of thing.''
   Shoopman had no choice but to borrow the money when his family,
shaken and weary, crossed into Saudi Arabia. They needed a place to
bathe and a flight home. The hotel and airfare costs mounted
quickly.
   ``We asked if we can make a payment schedule, but they said
they'll charge an interest rate,'' Shoopman said. Still, he didn't
think twice about taking the financial aid.
   ``You don't think about materialistic things when you're in a
position like that,'' Shoopman said. ``We didn't have time to think
about it.''
   But with time to reflect, reality has begun catching up.
   Shoopman thinks of the fax machine, computer and business files
ditched along with the rest of the family's possessions. He
imagines Iraqi troops using the crane and front-end loaders his
employees had to abandon in the invasion.
   ``We had signed contracts to export cement from Iraq,'' he said.
``We're talking about 600,000 tons of cement and five-year
contracts. It looked like everything was going to turn out real
nice, and then this happened.''
   Now it's catch as catch can. Shoopman is looking up old friends
in Decatur, Ala., in the hopes of finding a job. He and his family
are also remembering their desert journey, the gunfire and Bedouin
friends who led them to safety.
   Scores of Americans hit the ground running after Saddam invaded
Aug. 2. Now some are trying to outrun a new set of problems.
   Stephanie Atieh spent part of Monday standing in line for aid
from family services. She has three young children, is six months
pregnant and worried half-sick about the safety of her Jordanian
husband and his family in Kuwait.
   The couple's comfortable four-bedroom life on the fringe of
Kuwait City disappeared without warning, before they had a chance
to prepare.
   ``We went to sleep on a Wednesday night and by Thursday our
whole world was destroyed,'' Mrs. Atieh said Tuesday from
Stewartsville, Texas. ``We didn't have any money except what was in
our pockets because the banks closed down immediately.''
   Mrs. Atieh, her mother and children reached the Jordanian border
via a backroads route through Iraq. But once there, they found
themselves temporarily at a deadend.
   ``It took us a week to get money for one-way tickets (back to
the United States) and the papers say you have to pay it back in 60
days, which is impossible right now,'' Mrs. Atieh said.
   ``I owe the government $4,000 and my mother owes a little more
than $1,000,'' Mrs. Atieh said. ``They want us to pay back the
money. (But) we're refugees. We had some money, but now it's gone.''

   President Bush told an unusual gathering of
lawmakers today that steps were under way to make the sanctions
against Iraq ``as watertight as possible,'' and warned Baghdad:
``Let no one abroad doubt our national unity or our staying power.''
   It was Bush's first meeting with members of Congress since
American troops were deployed to Saudi Arabia in a crisis triggered
Aug. 2 when Iraq invaded the the neighboring oil-rich emirate of
Kuwait. As White House aides scoffed at Baghdad's declaration that
Kuwait had been incorporated as a province of Iraq, Bush reiterated
his demand that Iraq withdraw and reinstate the Kuwaiti government
to power.
   Bush hailed the tightening of the United Nations embargo against
Iraq as further evidence that Iraq ``cannot benefit from this
illegal occupation.''
   ``Iraqi oil no longer flows through pipelines in Turkey and
Saudi Arabia,'' the president said. ``Today, reports indicate that
traffic through Aqaba (Jordan) has come virtually to a halt, and
U.S. naval forces sail with navies of many other states to make
these sanctions as water tight as possible.''
   With many thousands of American soldiers now deployed in Saudi
Arabia, Bush said Iraq would ``pay a stiff price by trying to hold
on, and an even stiffer price by widening the conflict.''
   He also repeated that he would hold Iraq responsible for the
safety of Americans it has taken hostage in Kuwait and Iraq.
   With that, Bush ended brief public remarks and went into
``executive session'' to brief lawmakers privately, and field their
questions.
   The ranking Democrat, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
was asked whether Congress supports Bush's Middle East policy, and
answered, ``Yes.''
   Interrupting his vacation in Maine, Bush returned to the White
House and met in the Cabinet Room with top congressional leaders
before addressing a larger gathering of about 150 lawmakers _
returned from vacations of their own.
   Earlier, in Maine, Saddam Hussein's decree turning Kuwait into
Iraq's 19th province was dismissed by White House aides.
   ``The reaction is quite obvious,'' said presidential spokesman
Roman Popadiuk. ``The annexation is null and void. The whole United
Nations has spoken on it. And that's it.''
   The president, who has bristled at criticism that he should be
spending more time in Washington during the crisis, planned to stay
in the nation's capital until late Thursday before resuming his
vacation.
   He denied that his trip to Washington was a response to that
criticism _ or that his time spent in Maine fishing, playing golf
and boating was detracting from his ability to deal with the Iraqi
crisis.
   ``I've been able to keep in very close touch,'' he said Monday
during a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Bryan
Mulroney outside his oceanfront vacation home. ``We're making a lot
of international phone calls that you wouldn't normally expect at
the time of a vacation.''
   He cited the time he spends with key aides and meetings like
those with Mulroney and a session last week with Jordan's King
Hussein.
   ``We're on top of the situation. I think the American people
understand that,'' Bush said.
   This afternoon, Bush met first with top House and Senate
leaders, then with members of the House and Senate Armed Services,
Foreign Affairs, Appropriations and Intelligence committees.
   ``It is most understandable that they want to know what is going
on and get up to speed on things,'' Bush said. ``So I welcome
this.''
   Also briefing the members were Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
CIA Director William Webster, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
_ who cut short a Wyoming vacation _ and Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Colin Powell.
   In advance of today's meeting with Bush, Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
public support for keeping U.S. troops in the inhospitable Saudi
desert might evaporate ``if the United States is the only country
willing to put at risk a sizable ground force to defend the entire
world's interests.''
   ``That is not a sustainable condition,'' Pell wrote in a weekend
newspaper column.
   And Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., among a group of senators that
visited Saudi Arabia earlier this week, said, ``At some point we
have to realize the waiting game works against us ... I don't think
the American public is going to stand for waiting six or seven
months.''
   Lawmakers return to Washington early next month. Hearings on
various aspects of the crisis are certain.

<HEAD>Pentagon Increases Estimates for Operation Desert Shield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operation Desert Shield will cost an estimated
$2.5 billion through the end of September _ nearly double the
earlier estimate of $1.3 billion, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The sharply higher costs are attributed to the expense of
calling up reserve and National Guard forces, increased operations
for ships and aircraft and increased fuel costs, said spokesman
Pete Williams.
   Other factors include increases in the number of C-130 aircraft
in the Persian Gulf region and increases in the number of aircraft
carrier battle groups deployed there, Williams said.
   The cost estimate includes $1.13 billion for the Army, $494
million for the Navy, $556 million for the Air Force, $20 million
for defense agencies and $300 million for increased fuel prices.
   Reporting on its reserve call up, the Pentagon said that by the
end of the month it will have activated 14,129 people in hundreds
of Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard units across the country.
   The total includes:
   _Air Force: 7,386, including 616 from Air Force Reserve units,
386 from the Air National Guard and 6,384 Air Force reservists who
weren't formally activated but who volunteered for duty in the Gulf
crisis.
   _Navy: 2,236 sailors from 127 units will be activated by month's
end.
   _Army: 4,236 soldiers activated so far, including 542 National
Guardsmen from 19 units and 3,694 Army reservists from 34 units.
   _Coast Guard: 271 personnel.
   The Pentagon said additional expenses include the cost of
calling up reservists, up to a total of 48,200. The cost of the
call up, the operations of the reserve forces and their subsistence
is estimated at $347 million through September, it said.
   It pegged at $175 million the cost incurred due to the increased
tempo of flying time and ship use. The Pentagon noted that the
number of deployed carrier battle groups in the area of the Arabian
peninsula will increase to three from 1{.
   The Pentagon also said the 51 C-130 transport planes in use in
the crisis will more than double, to 112 aircraft, by the end of
September.
   Deployment of U.S. forces is proving costly, the Pentagon said:
   _Eight Fast Sealift SL-7 ships with crews and equipment: $34
million.
   _Sixteen Roll-on Roll-off ships and 20 cargo ships moved out of
the ready reserve fleet to active operations: $95 million.
   _The use of commercial and government cargo aircraft: $484
million.
   _The deploying of two Navy prepositioned ships for aviation
logistics support: $9 million.
   _One-time costs at various military installations to prepare
units for deployment: $135 million.
   The Pentagon said two hospital ships had been equipped and
deployed at a cost of $10 million, and that it has spent $30
million for medical supplies and $85 million for chemical
protective clothing, camouflage uniforms, nets and chemical-agent
resistant paint.
   Support for water, equipment, sanitation, supplies and other
consumables has cost $250 million, it said.
   The Pentagon said that while its operating costs are increasing
dramatically because of the Desert Shield operation, it faces a 35
percent reduction in operating appropriations if Congress and the
White House fail to reach a budget agreement by Oct. 1, thereby
avoiding the automatic cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction act.

   The most complete Tyrannosaurus rex
skeleton ever found is beginning to emerge as a museum's crew cuts
away plaster casts covering the fossil of the largest carnivore to
roam the Earth.
   ``This is it,'' the Museum of the Rockies' Pat Leiggi said
Monday as he tore a brittle piece from a 2-ton block of plaster and
bone.
   ``This is a lot of animal.''
   His work was just the beginning of cutting and research planned
on the T-Rex skeleton, only the eighth ever found.
   The T-rex, buried for 65 million years, was discovered in 1988
by a farm couple, Tom and Kathy Wankel of Angela, in the badlands
of eastern Montana.
   They brought an exposed foreleg to paleontologist Jack Horner at
the Bozeman museum, who immediately recognized it as a T-rex.
   Museum workers excavated the skeleton during the next two years,
finally packing the fossils in plaster to protect them during
transport to the museum.
   Museum crews are now working in public view in the museum's
Dinosaur Hall, going over the eight large chunks of bones and
plaster ``little by little,'' Leiggi said.
   The skeleton is made up of eight separate pieces of plaster
containing the hip, the back, the head, a shin, the right foot, the
left foot's toes, a section of the tail alone and a section of the
tail containing the lower jaw.
   The bones are so spread apart because water separated the bones
over time, Leiggi said.
   The museum's Phyllis B. Berger Dinosaur Hall is to officially
open to the public on Sept. 15.

<HEAD>Kohl Promises East German Prosperity; Workers Stage Walkouts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HALLE, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
tried to woo East German voters with promises of jobs and
prosperity Tuesday as a work stoppage over unification fears
brought some municipal services to a halt.
   Kohl's campaign speech received mostly cheers, but a group of
leftist protesters responded by hurling tomatoes and peaches.
   Earlier, about 45,000 workers across East Germany staged warning
strikes to demand better wages and job security in a united Germany.
   Kohl told a crowd of nearly 5,000 in Halle, about 125 miles
southwest of Berlin, that the legacy left by 40 years of Communist
rule was a ``sad thing'' and ``it is our goal that this economy
becomes a blossoming landscape.''
   It was Kohl's first appearance at an East German rally since the
setting of the Oct. 3 date for unification. It also marked the
start of his campaigning in East Germany for the leadership of a
united Germany.
   During the appearance, several hundred supporters of the
now-dissolved Communist Party repeatedly interrupted Kohl, who came
to this industrial city of 400,000 residents to open a training
program for young workers.
   As Kohl took to the podium, leftists tossed tomatoes and peaches
over the metal barrier separating the crowd from the chancellor.
The food splattered at the foot of the platform.
   Kohl, tanned after an Alpine vacation, criticized the
demonstrators, saying the issues of unity ``will not be decided on
the street.''
   Kohl told the crowd he was optimistic agreement could be reached
by the end of the week on the so-called ``unity treaty.'' Dispute
over abortion rules has delayed ratification of the treaty, which
covers a host of unification issues like tax revenues and property
claims.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere also appealed to
his countrymen to rebuild their country.
   ``We should lose no time. We have it easier than our eastern
neighbors. If we remain plucky and show the courage to act
responsibly, we'll be out of the woods soon. Our chances are
good,'' said de Maiziere.
   Kohl and de Maiziere hope to attract support for the Dec. 2
all-German elections and for East Germany's Oct. 14 state elections.
   The warning strikes were staged in Halle and at least nine other
cities.
   Nurses, secretaries, bus drivers, garbage-haulers and other
municipal employees stopped working for up to two hours.
   The workers demanded compensation for higher prices that have
resulted from the July 1 economic merger. They also demand that
East German income taxes not be immediately raised to West German
levels.
   There are about 1.6 million municipal workers in East Germany.
   Effects from the warning strikes were felt across the country.
   In Potsdam outside Berlin, buses and street cars stood still for
two hours, reported the official East German news agency ADN.
   Parked streetcars blocked key streets in Magdeburg and dozens of
garbage trucks hindered access to the city's main department store,
ADN said.
   Operations at Magdeburg's Elbe River harbor were temporarily
crippled by the walkout, said ADN.
   East German Health Minister Juergen Kleditzsch said more than
350,000 people are without work and indicated more than 900,000 are
working reduced hours.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday
overturned a lower court decision to free the youngest son of
ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu because of failing health.
   A military court in the southern Transylvanian town of Sibiu
decided last week to set Nicu Ceausescu free pending a verdict
because of his poor health. However, he remained in prison pending
the Supreme Court decision on the prosecution's appeal.
   The Supreme Court decided that Ceausescu, who is suffering from
advanced cirrhosis of the liver, may receive special treatment from
Health Ministry doctors, replacing prison doctors.
   Ceausescu is formally charged with ``complicity to genocide.''
He pleaded innocent but admitted to the lesser charge of illegal
possession of firearms and ammunition. The verdict is to be
rendered on Sept. 21 in Bucharest.
   Ceausescu was a leader of the former Communist Youth League
until 1987, when he became party secretary in Sibiu.

<HEAD>Once-Broke District Now Pays Students To Go to College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EMERYVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny school district once so broke
it gave teachers IOUs instead of paychecks is now so flush it gives
$1,000 to each college-bound student.
   ``This district was down and out. ... But we came back when
everybody gave up on us,'' said Peter Corona, superintendent of the
525-student Emery Unified School District. ``We showed that success
begins at home _ the good old ethic of hard work, dedication,
commitment and the will and desire to succeed and overcome all
odds.''
   The scholarship, believed to be the first of its kind in the
country, helps make college possible for students in this
low-income district between Berkeley and Oakland.
   The gifts, first provided to the class of 1989, are just one
example of the district's remarkable recovery from financial
adversity. Eight years ago, Emery Unified had a 24 percent budget
deficit _ the largest ever of any district in California _ that
threatened its very existence.
   The district in this bayside industrial town of 4,800 was once
wealthy. But a 1972 change in the way state property tax is
allocated left Emery Unified with less money, and the district got
into trouble because over 10 years it didn't cut spending, Corona
said.
   Corona discovered a $600,000 shortfall 10 days after coming to
the district as business manager in 1982. He boasts that Emery
Unified now enjoys a $1.5 million reserve _ 35 percent of its $4.3
million budget _ significantly higher test scores and improved
morale.
   But the rehabilitation took several years and had its price _
including a state loan, teacher layoffs and deep cuts in programs.
   ``The children have made sacrifices, our staff has made
sacrifices, and our community has had to make sacrifices,'' Corona
said.
   The district borrowed $600,000 from the state, laid off 60
percent of the staff, postponed raises and sent principals back to
the classroom. It cut classes in art, music, homemaking, French and
shop and reduced such basics as English, math, social studies and
physical education.
   Teachers doubled as custodians, mowing lawns and fixing plumbing
at the district's two schools. Corona became superintendent at the
start of the 1982-83 school year, remained business manager and
served as principal of a high school.
   For several months in 1983, the district was so strapped that it
gave its teachers IOUs, the first time a public agency in the state
had done so since the Depression.
   Some educators and parents suggested the district join one of
its larger neighbors, but Emery Unified began to recover, paying
back the state loan in three years, two years early. It rehired
some teachers, gave raises, restored some cut programs and added
new ones.
   Even today, the district, which employed 45 teachers before
dropping to 17 in the 1983-84 school year, only has 25 classroom
teachers.
   Meanwhile, test scores, traditionally at the bottom, have made
big gains. For example, on the state achievement tests taken by
eighth-graders, reading scores rose from 194 in the 1983-84 school
year to 251 last year; math scores jumped from 190 to 402; and
history scores increased from 184 to 367. And the dropout rate has
fallen to near zero.
   Emery Unified has been commended by U.S. Secretary of Education
Lauro Cavazos, state and county education officials and school and
taxpayers' groups.
   ``Some of the accomplishments here, I feel pretty proud of
them,'' said Tom Phan, 17, a junior who worked on the high school's
first hardcover yearbook in nearly a decade. ``I'm glad I'm
involved.''
   Corona introduced the scholarship program during the 1988-89
school year. Eleven of the 22 students in last year's graduating
class took the scholarship money.
   ``These are families who are struggling to make ends meet,
usually not highly educated but who really want and expect a good
education for their children. And they should,'' Corona said.
   Natasha Winfrey, an 18-year-old sophomore at the University of
California, Davis, said she and her family would have found a way
to get her to college somehow, but the district's gift helped eased
her anxiety about money.
   ``I was afraid I wouldn't be able to go to college,'' she said.
``So it made a difference, if only to inspire me to get other
things.''

<HEAD>Book Returned 50 Years, Six Days Overdue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anthology of English poetry has
been returned to the library _ 50 years and six days overdue.
   The copy of W.H. Auden's ``The Oxford Book of Light Verse'' was
returned Monday, said Gloria Garcia, automation coordinator for the
Corpus Christi Public Library.
   ``We were in shock,'' Ms. Garcia said.
   The date-due card was stamped Aug. 21, 1940. It had been checked
out from the old La Retama Library, which was the city's central
library for 75 years until 1986, when the Corpus Christi Public
Library opened.
   The tattered book was returned by an unidentified man, described
by a library worker as in his 30s.
   ``He just said that he and his wife had been going through some
stuff and found the book,'' said Joan Roith, a city reference
librarian. ``I teasingly asked if he'd like to pay the fine and he
just laughed.''
   The book was so ``old and moldy,'' Ms. Roith said the library
probably won't put it back on the shelves, let alone levy a fine.
   The maximum fine would only have amounted to $4.47, or half the
book's current $8.95 purchase price, said Mark Gretchen, the
library's reference services manager.
   ``The maximum fine we ever charge is half the price of the book
because we don't want to discourage people from returning overdue
books,'' Gretchen said.
   Since the library didn't retain its old records when it
converted to a computerized checkout system two years ago, the
borrower's identity probably will remain a mystery.
   ``Even if we could identify him, we couldn't divulge the name.
All of that is confidential,'' Gretchen said.

<HEAD>Ridiculed Sculpture May Return From Forced Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than five years of obscurity in
a state storage yard, Alaska's most slandered sculpture may be
returned from exile and again placed on display in front of a state
building.
   ``Nimbus,'' a 16-foot, 5-ton, blue-green hunk of steel is either
an ``unusually interesting piece'' or an eyesore representing the
worst in state spending.
   Those of the eyesore opinion succeeded in getting the sculpture
removed from the plaza in front of the State Capitol complex in
late 1984.
   Now fans of the sculpture want to put it back together and
relocate it on a lawn in front of the Alaska State Museum several
blocks away.
   ``Friends of Nimbus'' is asking the City Assembly to donate a
truck and crew to move the sculpture.
   Mark Daughhetee, the museum's exhibits coordinator, organized
the group to find a way to prevent Nimbus from rusting away
unappreciated.
   ``It's the most famous piece of sculpture in the state,'' he
said.
   Nimbus, the work of New York City artist Robert Murray, was
installed in 1978. It was commissioned at a cost of $40,000, with
half the money coming from the National Endowment for the Arts and
the other half from the state.
   Critics in the Alaska Legislature succeeded in passing a
resolution in 1984 suggesting Nimbus be replaced with a veterans'
memorial. That led to its removal, but it was never replaced.
   Retired state judge Thomas Stewart supports the group's efforts
to find Nimbus a new home.
   ``It was a crying shame that it was misunderstood by the general
public,'' Stewart said. ``To me it has always been an unusually
interesting piece of abstract art.''

   ``Friends of Nimbus'' is asking the City Assembly to donate a
truck and crew to move the sculpture.
   Mark Daughhetee, the museum's exhibits coordinator, organized
the group to find a way to prevent Nimbus from rusting away
unappreciated.
   ``It's the most famous piece of sculpture in the state,'' he
said.
   Nimbus, the work of New York City artist Robert Murray, was
installed in 1978. It was commissioned at a cost of $40,000, with
half the money coming from the National Endowment for the Arts and
the other half from the state.
   Critics in the Alaska Legislature succeeded in passing a
resolution in 1984 suggesting Nimbus be replaced with a veterans'
memorial. That led to its removal, but it was never replaced.
   Retired state judge Thomas Stewart supports the group's efforts
to find Nimbus a new home.
   ``It was a crying shame that it was misunderstood by the general
public,'' Stewart said. ``To me it has always been an unusually
interesting piece of abstract art.''

<HEAD>Federal Court Overturns Eyeglass Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday overturned a
Federal Trade Commission ruling that would have prevented states
from banning such operations as shopping mall stores that combine
optometric practice with eyeglass sales.
   ``An agency may not exercise authority over states as sovereigns
unless that authority has been unambiguously granted to it,'' wrote
Circuit Judge James Buckley of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
   The FTC ``acted beyond its statutory authority'' in its
so-called Eyeglasses II ruling last year, he wrote in an opinion
agreed to by Chief Judge Patricia Wald and Circuit Judge Douglas H.
Ginsburg.
   If the court were to ``uphold Eyeglasses II in the face of
congressional silence, we would short-circuit the protections
offered states by the political process,'' Buckley wrote.
   FTC attorney Lawrence DeMille-Wagman said no decision had yet
been reached on whether the commission would appeal. The fact that
the decision was unanimous is ``certainly a factor we'll have to
take into account,'' he said.
   While DeMille-Wagman said he was not surprised by the ruling,
California Deputy Attorney General Thomas S. Lazar, who argued the
case for the states, sounded both stunned and ecstatic when he
heard the news.
   ``No kidding! We won the case,'' he shouted to co-workers in his
San Diego office. ``Oh, how excellent, how excellent. I spent two
years working on this case, around the clock.''
   The FTC's ruling of March 1989 never took effect because the
California State Board of Optometry and others sought and received
a stay from the appellate court moments after the ruling would have
become effective last Sept. 1, Lazar said.
   The states had imposed restrictions that, in the words of the
court decision, ``tended to discourage the `commercial practice' of
optometry _ such as partnerships between optometrists and laymen,
use of trade names, and chain operations combining the practice of
optometry with the sale of eyeglasses in shopping centers _ in
favor of `traditional optometric practice' typified by sole
practitioners operating in professional office buildings under
their own names.''
   The FTC started investigating the state-imposed restrictions in
the mid-1970s. The commission's findings, published in 1980,
``indicated that these restrictions resulted in higher prices and
reduced the quality of eye care available to the public,''
Buckley's opinion noted.
   Nine years later, the FTC voted for Eyeglasses II even though
FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver voted against it ``based on principles
of federalism and his view that the FTC was without authority to
promulgate it.''
   The state optometry boards agreed with Oliver. Lazar said he
argued that the FTC action was circumventing the national political
process: ``In other words, `FTC, if you want to have this
authority, go across the street and get it from Congress.'''
   Lazar, who was the main attorney working on the appeal, said
California and 44 other states that imposed restrictions on
optometric practices never moved against the type of eyeglass
stores that exist in malls everywhere.
   ``There's nothing wrong with them,'' Lazar said. ``You walk in
there with your prescription and you walk out with your glasses in
an hour.
   ``They're opticians, not optometrists,'' he said. ``They're just
people who dispense glasses after a prescription has been written
by an optometrist.''
   What the states opposed was such practices as storefront
operations in which non-optometrists were writing and filling the
prescriptions or where optometrists had an economic interest in
selling eyeglasses.

   The projected value of U.S. farm exports is
holding steady at $40 billion despite a decline in the volume of
wheat shipments, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   At $40 billion, the value of agricultural exports for the fiscal
year that began last Oct. 1 is up slightly from $39.6 billion in
1988-89. The department's Economic Research Service said total
export quantity is expected to be 148.5 million metric tons.
   Officials said that while the tonnage will be up from last year
it is expected to be down from the 150 million tons forecast in May.
   The new forecast is down ``because weaker prospects for wheat
more than offset expected gains in corn, soybeans and soybean
meal,'' the agency said in its report.
   ``Larger prospective crops in several major importing countries,
increased competitor supplies (especially Canada), and buyers'
anticipation of even lower prices have led to sluggish U.S. wheat
and flour sales,'' the report said.
   But stronger demand for coarse grains by Asian countries and
Mexico has boosted the export forecast for those commodities, led
by corn.

   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq mingled with foreign hostages
Tuesday and then decreed that the women and children held captive
in his country were free to leave.
   A statement from the Revolutionary Command Council said the
decision was made ``to preserve the image of Arabs,'' the official
Iraqi News agency said.
   The agency, monitored, in Nicosia, Cyprus, said the foreigners
could leave starting Wednesday. It was not known how many women and
children were among the hostages in Iraq or whether the decree also
applies to foreigners in Kuwait.
   There are 500 Americans trapped in Iraq and 2,500 in Kuwait.
   The Iraqi news agency said Saddam made his decision after
foreigners expressed concern about their children. During Tuesday's
televised encounter, a woman with a British accent asked Saddam why
he was using foreign children ``in something they can't
understand.''
   At the same meeting, Saddam told the foreigners he was willing
to talk to President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
television about ending the Persian Gulf crisis.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, asked about
Saddam's suggestion, said: ``It's sick, and it doesn't even deserve
a response.''
   Another department spokesman, Mark Dillen, said the U.S.
government had received no official word of the planned release of
women and children. ``We hope it's true, but we have seen promises
and statements by Iraq in the past that have proven false,'' Dillen
said.
   Despite Saddam's conciliatory gestures, Baghdad hardened its
position on Kuwait, declaring it a 19th province of Iraq. The White
House condemned the move.
   Also Tuesday, U.S. officials said an American civilian died of a
heart attack in Iraq. The 56-year-old man, who was not identified,
was believed to be one of 63 Americans rounded up and taken to
strategic sites in Iraq for use as human shields against attack.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the death ``underscores the barbaric nature of
Iraqi policy toward foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait, and makes
a lie of Iraq's claim that they are all well treated and in no
danger.''
   In other developments:
   _Shipping sources said U.S. Navy warships stopped Greek and
Indian cargo ships in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Persian Gulf, and
U.S. crewmen boarded one before the ships were allowed to proceed
to Jordan.
   It was believed to be the first time a ship was boarded and
inspected by the U.S. Navy since a U.N. embargo began shortly after
Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   _The Soviet government said Washington's expulsion of Iraqi
diplomats could increase tensions in the conflict.
   _President Bush headed back to Washington from his vacation home
in Kennebunkport, Maine, to brief Congress on the gulf crisis. He
reiterated his demand that Saddam withdraw from Kuwait.
   _Most OPEC ministers tentatively backed a deal that would permit
increased oil production by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and some other
nations to help offset losses arising from the conflict. The
ministers delayed until Wednesday a formal meeting to approve the
agreement.
   _Stock markets rallied in Tokyo and London in response to an
announcement by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that
he would meet Thursday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
Stock prices slipped slightly on Wall Street.
   _The U.S. Army's heaviest ground firepower reached Saudi Arabia,
including dozens of M1-1P tanks and M2 Bradley armored infantry
fighting vehicles.
   _Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
urged Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to send more troops to Saudi
Arabia to show solidarity with the United States.
   Saddam's televised visit with foreigners was his second such
appearance and apparently intended to convince Western viewers that
he is taking a reasonable stand in the crisis. He was widely
condemned for his first visit last week, which was seen as a crude
attempt to use the detainees for propaganda purposes.
   The meeting was shown on Iraqi television and broadcast by Cable
News Network.
   One of the hostages shown was American Kevin Bazner, according
to his sister, Patricia Heath of Farmington Hills, Mich. Bazner,
his wife, Dawn, and their two children were stranded after their
plane stopped in Kuwait to refuel during the Aug. 2 invasion. ``I'm
glad I got to see my brother. I'm glad he's safe. I hope Dawn and
the kids are safe, too,'' Ms. Heath told CNN.
   It was not immediately clear what countries the other foreigners
were from, or when and where the meeting occurred. One woman who
asked a question spoke with a British accent. Another indicated he
was from France.
   The families appeared uncomfortable as they listened to Saddam's
rambling statement through a translator. Saddam said he was ``ready
and prepared for direct talks with Mr. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher. . .
. Let us have the debate between me and them on television for the
whole world to see.''
   Both the U.S. and British governments have said Iraq must pull
out of Kuwait before negotiations take place.

   In its report on Saddam's meeting with foreigners, the Iraqi
News Agency said the president ordered that one British family be
allowed to return home on the occasion of a child's birthday. There
was no mention of that in the TV broadcast.
   Saddam was shown entering a large room and greeting families,
shaking hands with men and patting children on the head. Dressed in
a brown suit and tie instead of his military uniform, he smiled as
he approached.
   He told them he knew they were feeling restricted. ``If my
family were in your place I would have the same feelings,'' he said.
   But Saddam added, ``Politicians are forced sometimes to take a
position that goes beyond what they see directly in front of them.
   ``If it had to do with human feelings toward you ... then I
would immediately say you should leave and go back to your
families.'' But he told them that their presence was needed to
prevent an attack.
   Saddam has used the same justification in the past for his
detention of about 21,000 foreigners, including 3,000 Americans and
3,000 Britons, who were trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the Aug. 2
invasion.
   British and U.S. officials say Iraq has moved more than 150
Britons and more than 60 Americans from Kuwait to strategic
locations for use as human shields against a possible attack.
   Iraqi newspapers published Saddam's decree turning Kuwait into
an Iraqi province. Iraq's longstanding claim to Kuwait dates back
to the time of the Ottoman Empire.
   Meanwhile, the press attache at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad,
Stephen Thibeault, said that according to the Iraqis, the American
died in the southern port city of Basra. He said the man apparently
died of a heart attack.
   Thibeault, speaking in a telephone interview, said Iraqi
authorities said they would allow U.S. officials to participate in
an autopsy.
   Asked if the atmosphere in Iraq worried him, he said:
   ``Nothing specific other than being in a country where people
are not allowed to travel freely and leave the country. I think
that any thinking person would be concerned about those
circumstances.''

<TEXT>
   A survey released Tuesday casts new doubt on
the old notion that women who have given birth by Caesarean section
must always deliver that way.
   The survey of 2,213 physicians by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that 63 percent of women who
attempt vaginal delivery after a previous Caesarean section succeed.
   ``Strides certainly have been made'' to convince women and their
physicians that vaginal deliveries are safe and successful
alternatives to repeat Caesareans, said Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan,
secretary of the organization.
   But she said since about 42 percent of the patients in the
survey chose to have another Caesarean, ``there is a need to
further educate women'' about the benefits of vaginal deliveries.
   Vaginal deliveries are less risky than Caesarean sections mainly
because the latter is a surgical procedure, said O'Sullivan,
associate chairwoman of obstetrics at the University of Miami in
Florida.
   Also, vaginal births are less expensive and the patient spends
less time in the hospital _ an average of $4,334 and two or three
days compared with $7,186 and four or five days for a Caesarean,
according to 1989 data from the Health Insurance Association of
America.
   The rate of Caesarean deliveries rose from 5.5 percent of all
U.S. births in 1970 to 24.7 percent in 1988.
   But O'Sullivan noted that the increase from 1986-87 and from
1987-88 was 0.3 percent, the smallest rise in five years.
   Also, the rate of vaginal births after Caesareans rose from 2.2
percent in 1970 to 12.6 percent in 1988, she said.
   O'Sullivan said the rate of repeat Caesareans appears to be tied
to the age of the physician. Ninety-eight percent of physicians
under 40 said they encourage their Caesarean patients to have
vaginal deliveries for subsequent births, compared with 84 percent
of physicians over 55.
   ``It takes a long time to change your practice pattern,''
O'Sullivan said, noting that some smaller hospitals still do not
offer the option of vaginal delivery to women with a previous
Caesarean.
   As recently as 15 years ago vaginal birth after a Caesarean was
not considered good medicine in the United States, though a
standard practice for years in many other countries.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the
largest professional organization for physicians in those
specialties, recommends that women who have had a low transverse
incision in a previous delivery and have no medical complications
should be encouraged to attempt labor and vaginal delivery in their
current pregnancy.
   A low transverse incision, which cuts into a non-contracting
portion of the uterus, is most commonly used in Caesareans today.
It largely replaced what is called the classical incision in which
the contracting muscles of the uterus are cut and are more likely
to rupture in a subsequent labor.

<HEAD>Protesters Defy Order Outlawing Demonstrations in Heart of Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Tuesday outlawed
demonstrations in central Bucharest after six days of sometimes
violent anti-government rallies, but protesters defied the order.
   About 100 demonstrators gathered in central University Square
for the seventh day, continuing a week of rallies against President
Ion Iliescu. They did not, however, block traffic or provoke a
massive police response.
   Earlier Tuesday, the municipality issued a decree saying
Bucharest's six main squares ``and their surrounding areas'' were
off-limits to demonstrations. That effectively made protests
illegal in the entire downtown area.
   The clampdown follows a series of turbulent protests in central
University Square along the capital's main boulevard.
Anti-government demonstrators had been gathering daily since
Wednesday, blocking traffic and shouting slogans against Iliescu.
   On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, police clashed with
demonstrators in and around the square. The worst violence broke
out Saturday night, when about 2,000 anti-riot troops and military
police were sent in.
   Demonstrators threw petrol bombs, bottles and rocks at the
police, and 80 people were arrested. At least two people two were
reported hospitalized.
   The new measures are similar to a national decree issued
January, which required special municipal authorizations for
rallies, and recommended they be held in parks.
   The January order was widely disobeyed, and protestors held
frequent rallies in front of government headquarters in Victory
Square during January and February.
   Bucharest municipal authorities said under the new rules,
arrangements would be made to allow demonstrations to be held in
four city parks and in stadiums.
   But posters and slogans throughout the city _ referring to the
popular uprising that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in
December _ said: ``The revolution was made in the streets, not in
parks.''
   University Square was the site of a 53-day anti-government
protest in June that sparked several days of violence in the
capital when the government cracked down on the demonstrators.
   That rally was organized by students and anti-Communists who
accuse Iliescu and his associates _ who won free elections in May _
of continuing Ceausescu's policy.
   This week's rallies, however, appeared to be motivated by the
deteriorating economy and attracted mostly lower-income workers.
   The governing National Salvation Front charged Tuesday that the
demonstrators were harming Romania's image and creating ``a
collective feeling of insecurity.''
   The army called for ``an atmosphere of calm and order in
Bucharest.''

   Thunderstorms developed over the north-central part of the
nation for a second day Tuesday, and a heat wave that is forcing
some schools to close early continued east of the Rockies.
   Thunderstorms developing along a cold front over north-central
states produced hail as big as golf ball at Lantry, S.D.
   The weather system also spun off a tornado southwest of
Rockford, Ill., the National Weather Service reported.
   Thunderstorms posed the threat of more severe weather from the
middle Missouri Valley through the middle Mississippi Valley to New
York state and Pennsylvania.
   A severe thunderstorm swept through northwestern Pennsylvania
early Tuesday, downing power lines and leaving about 11,000 people
without electricity. Tree limbs blocked several highways, and
police in Oil City said a large tree crashed through the roof of a
home. No one was injured.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed over much of the Gulf Coast
region during the afternoon, producing 0.95 of an inch of rain at
Brownsville, Texas, during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Unseasonably hot weather continued east of the Rockies, with
readings mostly in the 90s from the southern and central Plains to
the southern and middle Atlantic Coast. Temperatures were above 100
over parts of central Kansas, northern Oklahoma, north-central
Texas, western Tennessee and northern Alabama.
   Some eastern Nebraska schools said they'll close early the rest
of this week and high school football coaches planned to rest their
players and work out in the morning as a heat wave with
temperatures mostly in the 90s entered its sixth day Tuesday.
   Public schools in Lincoln, Neb., maintained normal hours Monday
when it hit 100 but monitored classrooms and decided to shut down
an hour early for the rest of the week.
   ``They felt that as the afternoon went on, it got worse,'' said
Meg Lauerman, spokeswoman for the school district.
   Alabama's hot, dry weather prompted state health officials to
issue a critical heat alert Tuesday. Farmers worried that their
cotton crops could be cut in half and that they would have to buy
feed for livestock lacking hay.
   ``The cotton is about knee-high to a duck,'' Madison County
agent Robert Burton said Tuesday.
   In Birmingham, Ala., school officials sent some 42,000 students
home about two hours early because of the lack of air-conditioning
in classrooms at about 30 schools.
   Tulsa, Okla., cooled down to an overnight low of just 82, and
St. Louis, Mo., reported a low of 80.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 34 at Craig, Colo.,
and West Yellowstone, Mont.

   Two more bodies were discovered Tuesday
in this university city, and police linked them to the mutilations
of three women students whose deaths set off a wave of fear at the
start of the school year.
   ``It's clear this part of the country has some maniac on the
loose,'' University of Florida President John Lombardi said during
a staff meeting. ``It reminds us of a natural catastrophe. The
killer is selecting victims by criteria that are not clear to us.''
   The bodies of a man and a woman were found together Tuesday
morning at a student apartment complex near one where two bodies
were discovered Sunday, said Alachua County Sheriff's Lt. Spencer
Mann.
   Police set up a command post between those off-campus sites and
about two miles from the apartment where a third body was
discovered early Monday.
   The two latest victims were identified as Tracy Inez Paules and
a 23-year-old friend, Manuel R. Tobada, both graduates of American
High School in Miami. Tobada had just been accepted at nearby Santa
Fe Community College and was planning to study architecture, said a
friend, Eric Dunham, 22, of Sarasota. Ms. Paules, whose age was not
available, reportedly was pursuing a law degree.
   Gainesville Police Chief Wayland Clifton said ``all five victims
are probably connected to one suspect or two suspects'' because the
methods of the killer appeared similar. He did not elaborate.
   The Gainesville Sun, however, reported Tuesday that mutilation
of the first three bodies found was the apparent connection.
   ``I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that
anybody that commits homicide using mutilation is a pretty sick
individual, and it's somebody we want to get off the streets very
badly,'' said Mann, the Alachua County sheriff's spokesman.
   ``It looks like it's a part of a serial killer,'' State
Chancellor Charles Reed said earlier in Tallahassee.
   Some students fled home, while others' parents rushed here to
guard their children. Some students said the slayings were
reminiscent of those by executed serial killer Ted Bundy.
   Gov. Bob Martinez ordered 50 state troopers and Florida
Department Law Enforcement agents and two crime labs to
Gainesville. Reed warned other Florida colleges to step up security.
   FBI agents also joined the investigators.
   State officials and police urged students not to go out alone,
to keep doors locked and use dead-bolt locks, and to keep in touch
with their worried parents.
   Three University of Florida students who live across the street
from the apartment complex where the two bodies were found Tuesday
said they were going home to Key West.
   ``We're horrified, we're scared, and we're going home at least
temporarily until this thing blows over,'' said Lydia Blanco, 22,
who lives with her sister Ileana Blanco, 20, and Lauren Bacle, 19.
   Joe Colucci said he made the five-hour drive here from his home
in Davi to stay with his daughter Jennifer, an 18-year-old freshman.
   ``I came here to be with my child and protect her as much as
possible. If they don't catch someone by this weekend, I'm taking
her home,'' he said.
   In Tallahassee, the governor played down speculation about a
Bundy ``copycat,'' even though experts on serial killers were being
consulted.
   Bundy was executed in Florida's electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989,
after murdering dozens of young women, including two Florida State
University sorority sisters in Tallahassee in a 1978 rampage he
followed with the murder of a 12-year-old girl in Lake City. The
Florida State Prison where he died is about 25 miles from here.
   ``That's what we're all saying. It's another Ted Bundy on the
loose,'' said Jana Walters, 18, a freshman from Longwood.
   Dave Krupezaki, 21, a UF student from Miami, said ``with what
happened last year with Tiffany Sessions, everybody is afraid.''
   Ms. Sessions, a 20-year-old UF student, vanished Feb. 9, 1989,
after leaving her apartment to go jogging. No trace of her has been
found.
   On Sunday, authorities found two victims _ freshmen Christina P.
Powell, 17, of Jacksonville and Sonya Larson, 18, of Deerfield
Beach, who had shared a townhouse apartment.
   One victim was nude and the other was partially clothed, said
police Lt. Sadie Darnell.
   Eight hours later, deputies found the body of Christa L. Hoyt,
18, a student at Santa Fe Community College and a records clerk at
the sheriff's office. Deputies checked on her when she failed to
report for her midnight shift.
   More than three-fourths of all 34,000 UF students live off
campus, but 95 percent of the 3,000 freshmen live in dormitories, a
school spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Australian Minister Says Peaceful Gulf Solution Widely Favored</HEAD>

   Australia's foreign minister said Tuesday the
United States and other countries opposed to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait regard military force as a last resort to end the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``I am very much more comfortable that the military option has
been put very much on the back burner,'' Foreign Minister Gareth
Evans told reporters after discussing the crisis with U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker III. ``There is ... solid and
universal international support for the sanctions strategy ... and
that's got every chance of success.''
   Earlier, Evans told a news conference, ``it doesn't do any harm
to make it very clear that at the end of the day, if this thing is
not resolved in any other way, the military option will be further
considered ... to make it very clear that you have the clout and
are prepared to see all hell break loose ... if there is going to
be any more (Iraqi) aggressive action, or if a hair in the head of
any hostage is harmed.''
   Evans met Baker, Pentagon officials and the news media near the
end of a six-day, round-the-world trip discussing the crisis with
policymakers and diplomats of European and Arab countries, the
United Nations and United States.
   He planned to fly home via Los Angeles Tuesday night, reporting
his findings Thursday to Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
Parliament.
   ``The policy of economic sanctions against Iraq is going to have
to be in place for some time ... before we can expect a sensible
response from the Iraqis, but I am rather more confident than
before I embarked that non-military options will prevail ...''
Evans said.
   Describing both world unity and Iraq's isolation as
unprecedented, he said, ``It is appropriate that all policies right
now be based on the sanctions route, and I am clear that is the
thinking of this (U.S.) administration, certainly the thinking of
the Europeans, certainly the thinking of the Arab nations.'' Evans
said he met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, officials of
the West European community _ currently headed by Italy _ in Venice
and Geneva and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
Arab and European U.N. representatives in New York.
   ``It is absolutely crucial,'' he said, ``that all of us in the
international community ... be prepared to sit this out for as long
as it takes. Whether the end game involves overthrow (of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein), capitulation without a political package
to go with it or whether it does involve some ladders for the
Iraqis to climb down remains to be seen,'' Evans said.
   The important thing is that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, restore
the Kuwaiti government and release foreign nationals desiring to
leave, he said.
   The sanctions could cost Australia $1 billion, including $400
million in annual sales of wheat, meat and dairy products and
another $600 million in accumulated debts, Australian officials
said. But Australia backs them as the first post-cold war test of
the international community's ability to manage regional conflicts
by refusing to appease any country believing that might makes
right, said the foreign minister.
   Australia is rushing two heavily armed frigates and a supply
ship to the gulf, Evans said.

   Saddam Hussein's vow to set women and children free eased some
of the tension Tuesday for thousands of families keeping a
month-long vigil for loved ones trapped in the Middle East. But
their cheers were restrained.
   ``I don't want to be a downer, but he's said things before ...
he said he was going to let all the diplomats go,'' said Pauline
Gerard of New Harmony, Ind. ``Everything hinges on this ... and I
don't want to be crushed.''
   Mrs. Gerard's pregnant sister got trapped in Kuwait when a visit
with in-laws collided with Iraq's invasion Aug. 2. Since that day,
the family has been waiting for news like this. But when it finally
came the Gerards, like many of the hostages' families, reined in
their emotions.
   ``We've been waiting for this almost a month now,'' Mrs. Gerard
said. ``I don't want to get my hopes up too much because I don't
want to fall down too far if it doesn't work out.''
   ``I'll believe it when I see them home in this state,'' said
Margaret Nuzum of Hutchinson, Kan. Her daughter, son-in-law and two
young children last got a call through from the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait on Aug. 19. ``Until them I'm just praying.''
   The Coming Home Committee's founder was more effusive. ``It's
just an excellent sign,'' said Michael Saba, a Champaign, Ill.,
businessman who escaped Iraq shortly after the invasion.
   ``Whether the men are soon to follow or whether that's something
that has to be worked out isn't clear, but I'd say the signs are
good,'' he said. ``I think we're seeing some signs that say there's
some ... interest in de-escalating the situation.''
   Saddam's decree, broadcast by the Iraqi news agency, followed a
meeting Tuesday with hostages in which he agreed to talk to
President Bush and Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about
ending the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But despite the conciliatory gestures, Baghdad hardened its
position on Kuwait, declaring it a 19th province of Iraq. This
stand is one that concerns Jo Ellen Buehler, whose sister is
married to a Kuwaiti air force officer.
   ``I'm going to stay excited and keep everyone's spirits as high
as I can because that's all we have to clutch onto,'' Buehler said
from Memphis, Tenn. ``(But) I don't want to jump the gun.''
   Saddam decreed that ``all women and children who are foreigners
in Iraq are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel whenever
they want starting tomorrow, including the families Iraq is
hosting,'' the Iraqi News Agency said, in a report monitored in
Nicosia.
   But Buehler said she's worried Saddam means only to free the
estimated 500 Americans trapped in Iraq.
   ``He didn't say anything about Kuwait,'' said Buehler, whose
sister and three young nephews are among about 2,500 Americans
stuck in the annexed country. ``What about Kuwait?''
   Or, worse still, ``what if this is a way of gathering up and
carting them off to another place in a larger mass?''
   Buehler, who hasn't heard from her sister since Aug. 3, was not
alone in her trepidation. Families around the country said they
were trying to blot out thoughts of an elaborate, hope-crushing
scheme.
   ``You don't know what they're going to do,'' said Eleanor
Gicking of Arlington, Tenn. ``They might even have a trap for
them.''
   But, in her heart of hearts, Mrs. Gicking said, she can't
believe that. She choked up at hearing her baby grandson and
daughter, who is married to a Kuwaiti, could be freed Wednesday.
   ``They're going to get out,'' she said, her voice straining
against tears. ``They have to get out.''

   Saddam Hussein, in what Baghdad said was
a sympathetic response to hostages' pleas for their children's
safety, announced Tuesday that foreign women and children would be
allowed to leave Iraq.
   The dramatic announcement came hours after the Iraq president
met with a group of foreigners who were trapped by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, which carried the announcement,
said Saddam was moved by the foreign families' fears over their
children's plight.
   ``We hope it's true,'' State Department spokesman Mark Dillen
said of the announcement. But, he noted, ``We have seen promises
and statements by Iraq in the past that have proven false.''
   He said the department had received no official word of the
Iraqi decision and was seeking more information through its embassy
in Baghdad.
   Britain's Foreign Office, too, said it was seeking official
confirmation that women and children would be freed. ``We would
love to hear it,'' said a spokesman, who by custom was not
identified.
   About 3,000 Americans and 3,300 Britons are among the 21,000
trapped Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Saddam has vowed to
use them as human shields against attacks on Iraqi installations.
   British and U.S. officials say Iraq has moved more than 150
Britons and more than 60 Americans from Kuwait to strategic
locations.
   A statement from the Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council
said the decision was made ``to preserve the Arab humanitarian
image,'' the official Iraqi News Agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the Iraqi president
decreed ``that all women and children who are foreigners in Iraq
are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel whenever they want
starting tomorrow, including the families Iraq is hosting.''
   Saddam has consistently referred to the captive foreigners as
guests, not hostages, and has told them their presence would help
prevent all-out war from erupting.
   The news agency repeated that view, saying the foreigners were
``prevented from traveling on humanitarian grounds aimed at fending
off the fires of war and deterring those seeking to start it.''
   But, it said: ``We opted to preserve the Arab humanitarian
image'' by freeing the women and children.
   Western nations have denounced the detentions as hostage-holding.
   The news agency said the decision was effective Wednesday. It
was not clear whether it included foreigner women and children
trapped in Kuwait, which Baghdad now considers part of Iraq. It was
also not known how many of the trapped foreigners are women and
children.
   In the televised meeting with Western captives at an undisclosed
location, Saddam told the group: ``I appreciate your feelings,
which probably make you feel restricted because you are not allowed
to go.''
   ``If I were in your place or my family was in your place, I'd
have the same feelings,'' said Saddam, shown wearing a
light-colored double-breasted suit, sitting in an armchair beside a
coffee table laden with flowers.
   Some of the foreigners were allowed to ask questions, and they
expressed concern about children being held.
   One of the hostages shown was American Kevin Bazner, according
to his sister, Patricia Heath of Farmington Hills, Mich. Bazner,
his British wife, Dawn, and their two children were stranded when
the plane they were aboard made a refueling stop in Kuwait during
the invasion.
   ``I'm glad I got to see my brother. I'm glad he's safe. I hope
Dawn and the kids are safe, too,'' Ms. Heath told Cable News
Network.
   The Iraqi president's meeting with the foreigners was broadcast
by CNN.
   One woman with a British accent asked Saddam why he was using
children as leverage ``in something they can't undersand.'' He gave
a long answer in which he repeated that he was forced to act
because of Western troops massing in the region.
   A young Frenchman asked if he and his wife could return to
France, saying they could then explain to the French people that
Iraq had humane intentions.
   In the broadcast, Saddam complained that the international trade
embargo against Iraq was reducing supplies of food and medicine,
saying ``children will be undernourished,'' and the cutoff of
medicine could cause outbreaks of disease.
   ``When food is cut off from a society, then you're actually
choking the society to death,'' he told the Western hostages.
   As the broadcast began, Saddam was shown entering a large room
and greeting the Western families, shaking hands with men and
patting children on the head.
   It was the second time Saddam visited hostage families in a
broadcast intended for Western viewers. He was widely condemned for
his first visit last week, which was seen as a crude attempt to
gain Western sympathy.

   A bank employee and customer were
shot and killed and another employee was wounded Tuesday during an
attempted bank robbery, a sheriff said.
   A 17-year-old boy was in custody, said Miami County Sheriff
Charles Cox. He refused to release the suspect's name.
   Cox said police received a call after noon from a person who
found the doors of the Fifth Third Bank locked. He said deputies
kicked in the doors and found the victims, all shot with a handgun,
he said.
   Cox said the victims had multiple gunshot wounds.
   ``I'm sure the people would have willingly given him the
money,'' Cox said. ``But to execute them _ that's senseless.''
   There was no immediate word how much money was taken, but Cox
said it was recovered in a wastebasket found in the bank parking
lot.
   He said a packet of paint pellets placed in the money had
exploded as intended. Such booby traps are intended to startle and
mark bank robbers with paint; there was no immediate word if anyone
was splattered with paint from that packet.
   Cox said the suspect was identified by the wounded bank
employee. The teen-ager was taken into custody at his home about
about one and a half hours later.
   He said no money was found on the suspect and police were still
searching for a weapon.
   The wounded employee was taken to Miami Valley Hospital in
Dayton. A nursing supervisor who refused to give her name said the
woman was in critical condition.

   The Justice Department's soldiers in the war
on crime would have to take time out from the battle if Congress
and the Bush administration don't agree on spending cuts, officials
said Tuesday.
   FBI agents, federal prosecutors and other law enforcement
officials would be furloughed in the coming fiscal year if a
deficit-reduction package is not enacted into law, the officials
said.
   The Justice Department began sending out notices to tell its
80,000 employees they could be furloughed for up to 22 days in the
1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The furloughs would be
spread out over the 12-month period.
   A 32 percent spending cut in government agencies will be
implemented unless Congress and the White House agree by the end of
September on other ways of reducing spending, or raising revenue,
to meet the deficit targets in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
   The notices held out the possibility of longer furloughs if the
deficit-reduction package is not approved by Congress.
   A copy of a budget memo sent to Justice Management Division
employees said it would be necessary to impose 70-day furloughs for
the entire fiscal year if a budget agreement is not reached during
the 1991 fiscal year.
   Special arrangements will have to be made so that prosecutors
who are in the middle of trying crimimal cases in court are not
furloughed, officials said. There are about 3,800 federal
prosecutors assigned to 94 U.S. attorneys offices nationwide.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, U.S. attorneys and other
presidential appointees, such as assistant attorneys general, would
not be furloughed.
   At the FBI, no decision has been made yet whether furloughs
would apply to undercover agents, said spokesman Carlos H.
Fernandez. But the furloughs would apply to all other FBI
employees, including the agents assigned to foreign
counterintelligence, Fernandez said.
   ``We will try to do our duty as best we can, but to say it won't
affect operations would be a mistake,'' he said. The FBI employs
9,800 agents and 12,910 support personnel.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said it has no plans to
furlough its 3,000 agents but will impose a hiring freeze and stop
paying overtime to meet the deficit-reduction targets. DEA also
will eliminate ``all but essential operational travel, all
equipment purchases and repairs and all in-service training,'' said
spokesman Bill Ruzzamenti.
   But the Bureau of Prisons, which houses 57,600 federal inmates
in overcrowded prisons, sent furlough notices Tuesday to its 18,500
employees.
   Each employee would be furloughed for 3 1@2 days per two-week
pay period, said Douglas Lansing, assistant director for human
resources.
   Furloughs would make the job of running federal prisons
``incredibly challenging,'' Lansing said. ``That's a euphemism.''
   ``We don't think we could do it,'' he added.

<HEAD>Drug Chief Sounds Warning in Mexican Doctor Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration said Tuesday the war on drugs may be harmed by a
judge's order that could free a Mexican doctor from U.S.
prosecution in the murder of a DEA agent.
   Foreign suspects should not be allowed to leave the country
merely because their own governments protest, suggested Robert C.
Bonner, who resigned a federal judgeship in Los Angeles to take the
DEA job.
   ``The implications of the case are that anyone who can get a
foreign government to issue a note of protest may have a ticket out
of prosecution and conviction and sentence in the United States,''
he said.
   The case concerns Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, wanted in the
1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena
in Mexico.
   DEA agents made $20,000 in payments to Mexicans who brought the
physician across the border to Texas, where he was arrested by DEA
agents in early April and transported to Los Angeles to stand trial.
   The Mexican government protested the action, saying it violated
Mexican sovereignty, and has sought the extradition of a DEA agent
and a DEA informant to stand trial on kidnapping charges.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward Rafeedie _ until recently a
colleague of Bonner _ ordered the physician returned to Mexico,
saying the extradition treaty between the two countries was
violated. The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco granted a stay
of that order, and Rafeedie has denied bail while the appeal is
pursued.
   Bonner said he urged the Justice Department to appeal Rafeedie's
decision. The DEA did nothing wrong in bringing Alvarez to the
United States, he said.
   Bonner is a former U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who pushed
prosecution of those involved in the Camarena slaying. He said he
is committed to pursuing the investigation of the Camarena killing:
``There is no statute of limitations on the murder of a federal
agent.''
   On another issue, Bonner said he disagrees with recent
pronouncements by drug director William Bennett and Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said that
success in curbing cocaine supplies led to increased violence on
America's streets this summer.
   If the nation achieves the ultimate objective _ a substantial
reduction in the availability and use of illegal drugs _ ``you will
have a dramatic and substantial reduction in violent crime in the
United States,'' he said.
   Bonner acknowledged that he was unsure what the interim period
might bring in terms of violence.
   In June, Bennett said increases in the wholesale price of
cocaine in several cities around the country indicated that ``we
are beginning to have a positive effect on the flow of cocaine into
this country.''
   Although he had long cited a need to get rid of drugs to help
cut down the violence connected to drug-trafficking in the cities,
he said disruption of the cocaine flow would have the opposite
effect.
   ``In some of our communities where there is a shortage of
cocaine, there will be violence as a result of that,'' Bennett
said. ``There will be the same number of dogs fighting over a
smaller number of bones.''
   Biden said, ``Drug violence is on the rise as the quality of
crack cocaine drops and gangs battle for turf.''

<TEXT>
   The five permanent Security Council
members agreed Tuesday on plans for a truce in Cambodia and U.N.
administration of the country until a new government is elected.
   It would be an ``unprecedented'' U.N. operation to solve a
regional conflict, one U.S. diplomat said _ costing $3 billion to
$5 billion over one or two years, and involving up to 10,000
peacekeeping troops and 10,000 civilian personnel.
   The five _ the United States, Britain, France, China and the
Soviet Union _ ended two days of private talks on details of a
transitional administration to guide Cambodia to peace and
democracy.
   ``We have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members,''
said a U.S. diplomat involved in the talks.``Now it is up to the
four Cambodian parties. The question is, can the four Cambodian
factions agree?''
   The diplomat was referring to the Khmer Rouge, its two
non-communist guerrilla allies, and the Vietnam-installed
government in Cambodia. The diplomat and several other sources
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Cambodian factions are to meet in Indonesia in September.
   The U.S. diplomat said, ``We think there are grounds, if not for
wild optimism, at least for strong confidence'' all parties will
agree.
   A Western ambassador close to the talks said he thought the
chances were better than even.
   On Aug. 22, he said, the three resistance factions issued a
communique expressing support for the work of the five permanent
Security Council members and willingness to accept military and
administrative arrangements, which were worked out earlier.
   Tuesday's accord means the backers of the warring factions _ the
United States, Soviet Union and China _ agree on a peace plan.
   The Khmer Rouge gets its weapons and supplies from China; the
Soviets back the current Cambodian government of Prime Minister Hun
Sen; the United States backs the two non-communist guerrilla
factions.
   The Western ambassador said if all goes well, a truce could take
effect by November.
   The U.S. diplomat said the agreement would give the United
Nations ``very broad authority to administer and to control
Cambodia.''
   Its significance regarding U.N. involvement in a regional
conflict would far exceed the U.N. role in guiding Namibia to
independence from South Africa, which cost more than $750 million.
   The United States pays 30 percent of all peacekeeping costs.
   The key issues now, the diplomat said, are organizing a
cease-fire and elections so that a new government can be
established that is not dominated by the Khmer Rouge or the current
pro-Vietnam government.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to oust the Khmer
Rouge, who presided over the deaths of up to a million Cambodians
from starvation and executions during their brutal rule that began
in 1975.
   For a decade, America followed the position taken by the United
Nations and most of the world, of recognizing the three-party
guerrilla alliance, including the Khmer Rouge, as Cambodia's
legitimate government.
   After Hanoi announced last year that all its troops had been
withdrawn, and the Khmer Rouge began scoring impressive battlefield
gains, Washington policymakers fretted more about a possible return
to power by the Khmer Rouge than about Vietnam's invasion.
   In July, Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced
Washington was ending its recognition of the guerrilla alliance and
would open talks with Hanoi on ending the war.
   America has not announced any cut-off of aid for Prince
Sihanouk's or Son Sann's factions, however.
   The U.S. diplomats and others involved in the talks said the
participants approved five documents to be sent on to the Cambodian
factions and others concerned.
   According to an official statement, these cover ``transitional
arrangements regarding the administration of Cambodia during the
pre-election period; military arrangements during the transitional
period; elections under United Nations auspices; human rights
protection; (and) international guarantees'' that Cambodia will be
non-aligned, neutral and democratic.
   They call for a cease-fire; for warring parties to disengage,
disarm and settle in U.N.-monitored ``cantonments;'' and for U.N.
peacekeepers to move in. The United Nations would organize
elections and verify that all Vietnamese forces have indeed left
Cambodia.
   Cambodian guerrillas claim many Vietnamese troops remain in
Cambodia in disguise.
   Western officials believe once the truce takes effect, it would
take about a year to get ready for elections.
   The draft documents call for the United Nations to ``supervise
and control . . . if necessary'' five key Cambodian ministries _
defense, foreign affairs, finance, public security and information,
various diplomats said.

<TEXT>
   West German police on Tuesday
arrested a former senior Communist Party official who served under
ousted East German leader Erich Honecker.
   Arrested was Wolfgang Biermann, a former member of Honecker's
Communist Party Central Committee and one-time manager of the Carl
Zeiss combine in the East German city of Jena.
   Biermann, 62, who resettled in Saarbruecken in February, was
sought by the East German district prosecutor in Gera for allegedly
misappropriating property belonging to the Carl Zeiss Institute
museum, the Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper said.
   The newspaper said East German investigators estimate the value
of the museum property at $180,600. The report was provided in
advance to other news media and will appear in the newspaper's
Wednesday editions.
   Police in Saarbruecken said Biermann had been arrested but
declined to elaborate.
   Biermann has denied any wrongdoing.
   The Carl-Zeiss combine is known for producing finely tuned
optical equipment among other technical products.
   Following the collapse of East Germany's hard-line Communist
government last year, Honecker and most of his leading lieutenants
were arrested for investigation of corruption and abuse of power.

   CNN's broadcast Tuesday of Saddam Hussein's
latest meeting with Western hostages raised the question: Should
news operations give the Iraqi leader live access to U.S.
television?
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, deputy director of news at NBC. ``We made that decision
the first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure
propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
carried the Iraqi satellite transmission live on Tuesday, as the
Cable News Network did. Instead, they showed portions somewhat
later.
   But CNN management defended its practice, saying the meeting was
deemed of sufficient importance to air immediately.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said at the network's Atlanta headquarters.
In Tuesday's case, he said, CNN understood that Saddam would be
speaking with American hostages.
   ``There was no question in our minds this would be newsworthy,''
Haworth said.
   After the coverage, Pati Heath of Detroit, the sister of an
American hostage, called CNN to say she had seen her brother on TV.
CNN put her on television, too.
   She wasn't troubled by the dispute over CNN's programming
decision. ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,''
she said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.'
   CNN noted that it was relaying an Iraqi TV feed. Afterward, the
network aired a debate on the wisdom of its decisions.
   It is, by all accounts, a somewhat sticky question.
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins,
director of news information for ABC in New York. The president of
ABC News has to approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television Thursday with Western
hostages, ABC broadcast the Iraqi satellite feed for a few moments
after first viewing the transmission to gauge its content.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Tuesday, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report, she said.
   NBC regards the question of whether to air Iraqi feeds as a
cut-and-dried journalistic issue, McFarland said from NBC's New
York headquarters.
   ``We would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first knowing
what it was,'' he said. ``We took every frame of it into the house,
looked at it, and then selected two or three bites.''
   CBS officials didn't respond Tuesday to a request for comment.

   The chief witness against a paratrooper
accused of murder in last year's invasion of Panama acknowledged
Tuesday that he shot an unarmed Panamanian in the back during the
operation.
   1st Lt. Brandon Thomas, the first witness at the court-martial
of Master Sgt. Roberto Bryan, said under cross-examination that he
had taken the Panamanian prisoner and was searching him when he ran
away.
   ``He seemed to me at the time a potential threat,'' Thomas
testified.
   Thomas said he didn't know the man was unarmed until after he
shot him.
   Bryan, an 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper with a
distinguished 19-year record, is accused of shooting another
Panamanian without provocation on Dec. 23, three days after the
United States invaded Panama to oust dictator Manuel Noriega.
   He doesn't deny killing the man, but maintains the shooting was
justified.
   If convicted of unpremeditated murder, the military equivalent
of second-degree murder, Bryan, 42, could be sentenced to life in
prison.
   The shooting by Bryan occurred after a Panamanian tossed a
grenade that wounded 10 soldiers of the 82nd Airborne at a
roadblock, authorities said.
   Thomas said he went up to Bryan, grabbed his M-16 rifle and
said, ``... What the hell are you doing? He was almost dead anyway.
You didn't have to empty a magazine into him.''
   The lieutenant testified that Bryan stepped back with a startled
look on his face and said, ```He injured my people.''
   Thomas, who helped the Army bring the charge against Bryan and
said he hadn't been granted immunity from prosecution, made at
least three statements on the Bryan shooting at military hearings.
   Capt. Steve Lamb, a military attorney representing Bryan, spent
most of his cross-examination asking Thomas about discrepancies in
his statements.
   In opening arguments, Capt. Charles Luckey, one of two Army
prosecutors, said the case is one of justification and whether
Bryan ``did it out of revenge.''
   ``The United States of America submits to you that this is a
simple case _ not an easy one,'' he said. ``There is no lipstick on
the glass, no fingerprints on the windowsill ... but I do have
American soldiers to testify about that they saw.''
   Bryan's attorney, Mark Waple, said evidence would show that most
of the witnesses being called by the prosecution were biased
against Bryan.
   An eight-member military panel, similar to a civilian jury, will
decide the case.

<HEAD>Family Settles Lawsuit for $1.7 Million Over Police Custody Death</HEAD>

   The family of a young graffiti artist who died
after his 1983 arrest in a subway station in what critics said was
police brutality reached a $1.7 million settlement Tuesday with the
city and the Transit Authority.
   Leaders in the black community charged that Michael Stewart was
a victim of a beating at the hands of white police. Six of the 11
transit police officers involved in his arrest were acquitted of
criminal charges in 1985.
   The agreement, which ends a 4-year-old wrongful death lawsuit,
was approved by U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum. ``I certainly
hope justice is done,'' he said.
   Neither the city nor the Transit Authority admitted liability
for Stewart's death.
   ``There is no admission of any wrongdoing by any transit police
officer in the settlement,'' said Barry Agulnick, an attorney
representing one of the 11 officers who also were defendants in the
lawsuit.
   The family's lawyers and supporters disagreed.
   ``There is, as reflected in the size of the settlement, a clear
acknowledgement by the defendant parties ... of their
responsibility for the wrongful death and subsequent cover-up that
occurred in this case,'' said Hazel Dukes, president of the New
York state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   ``However the defendant parties might wish to put a spin on the
closure of this litigation, no amount of words can deny that
reality and the vindication encompassed therein,'' Dukes said in a
statement.
   ``Michael Stewart's death was a tragedy. No amount of money can
compensate a mother or a father, a sister or a brother for such a
loss,'' Mayor David Dinkins said in a statement. ``But I hope this
settlement helps members of his family to continue rebuilding their
lives.''
   Stewart, 25, was arrested Sept. 15, 1983, on charges that he had
spray-painted graffiti on the walls of the subway station.
   Transit police later took him, bruised and unconscious, to
Bellevue Hospital, where he died 13 days later.
   The lawsuit charged that Stewart was beaten by police after his
arrest and that the officers concealed their alleged involvement in
his death.
   The family accused the Transit Authority of failing to
adequately investigate and discipline the officers involved.
   In addition, the lawsuit alleged that former city Medical
Examiner Elliot Gross obstructed justice by failing to make a
proper diagnosis of the cause of death and failing to classify the
death as a homicide.
   Three transit policemen were indicted on charges of
manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, hindering prosecution,
reckless endangerment, assault and official misconduct.
   The indictments were later struck down because one grand juror
pursued his own independent investigation.
   In February 1985, six transit police officers were indicted,
three of them for the second time. All six were acquitted of all
charges on Nov. 24, 1985.
   A 1987 report by a special counsel appointed to investigate
Stewart's death concluded that excessive restraint was used in his
arrest. The special counsel also found that the arresting officer
lied about Stewart's condition and was derelict in his duty, and
that the investigation of the death by the Transit Authority Police
Department was inadequate.
   Under the settlement, lawyers said, Stewart's parents and
brother and sister will receive $920,000. The remaining $780,000
will pay for expenses and lawyers fees.

   Black activists Tuesday pitched tents on Liberty
Island, forcing the closing of the Statue of Liberty, to mark the
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
   They also said they want to rename the city for the slain civil
rights leader.
   Separately, black construction workers drove a honking caravan
of trucks and backhoes to City Hall in a demand for more jobs.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a flamboyant and controversial activist,
and Lenora Fulani, who is running for governor on the New Alliance
Party ticket, led about 100 people from City Hall down Broadway to
Battery Park City, a skyscraper development at the lower tip of
Manhattan.
   ``We want to rename New York City, Martin Luther King City,''
Fulani said at a rally at Battery Park City. ``We want to reclaim
the city for our people.''
   They later headed out to Liberty Island, where Sharpton and an
estimated 40 to 80 supporters forced the closing of the Statue of
Liberty, said spokesman Manny Strump of the National Park Service.
The demonstrators pitched tents there in support of the homeless,
said Sharpton ally C. Vernon Mason.
   Strump said the island was closed at 2 p.m. for the remainder of
the day _ it normally closes at 5 p.m. Tourists were taken off the
island, he said.
   At about 5:15 p.m., 14 of the demonstrators, including Sharpton,
were ticketed for demonstrating without a permit, said Strumpf. The
14, who face $50 fines, then left the island peacefully on a park
service boat, Strumpf said. The rest of the demonstrators had left
on their own before the tickets were issued.
   On Aug. 28, 1963, King gave his ``I Have a Dream'' speech before
200,000 people in Washington.

<HEAD>State's Assault on Encephalitis-Bearing Mosquito Could Be Killing
Fish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 million spraying campaign to kill mosquitoes
that carry encephalitis also may be killing thousands of tiny fish,
but it's nothing to worry about, the state's expert on fish kills
said Tuesday.
   By Tuesday, the dawn and dusk spraying of 700,000 acres in
southeastern Massachusetts with malathion that began Monday was
more than half completed.
   The campaign's target is the adult mosquito that carries the
sometimes fatal Eastern equine encephalitis virus.
   The state has monitored the mosquitoes for the virus since the
1930s. The last time anyone in Massachusetts died of the disease
was in 1984.
   If there is a connection between the spraying and fish deaths,
it won't harm the food chain and it's no disaster, said Richard
Keller, a biologist at the Westboro headquarters of the Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife.
   ``It's not good news,'' Keller said of the dead fish. ``But
weighted against the eastern encephalitis (virus), it's something
we're going to obviously have to accept. It's certainly not
catastrophic.''
   The health department said people still need to protect
themselves against the mosquito's bite once the spraying ends.
   The mosquitoes that carry the virus favor the state's swampy
southeastern corner. The state is spraying 3 ounces of malathion
per acre as long as the temperature is over 62 degrees, the wind is
no faster than 10 mph and it doesn't rain.
   Officials have said the pesticide does no serious harm. They
argue that the risk of encephalitis, which causes swelling of the
brain and kills 30 percent of its victims, is greater than any that
malathion may pose.
   A 7-year-old boy from Marshfield is the only confirmed case of
encephalitis this year. He was in fair condition Tuesday at
Floating Hospital in Boston.
   Four suspected cases are being tested.
   It will be a few days at least before scientists know whether
the spraying program eradicated the mosquitoes it was aimed at.
Even then, officials said, it is expected to wipe out only 90
percent to 95 percent of the insects.
   ``You are reducing the risk substantially, but we don't want
people to think there is zero risk,'' said Department of Public
Health spokeswoman Mary Ann Hart. ``There will be some mosquitoes
around. People should still take precautions.''
   Descriptions of dead and sick fish and eyewitness reports
``leads us to believe these are related to the malathion
spraying,'' said Keller.
   But he said results of tests on the fish won't be available for
another couple of days.
   ``It's circumstantial,'' said Keller. ``However, personnel in
the field say the fish they have examined exhibit the symptoms of
pesticide poisoning, nervous tremors associated with
pesticide-related kills.''
   Fish kills usually occur at the rate of one or two a week, he
said. Since Monday, he has heard of 14 or 15.
   The dead fish were largely of the minnow-like killifish species,
which is around 1 to 1{ inches long and feeds near the water's
surface. They were turning up dead in coastal estuaries.
   Keller said malathion breaks down fast and doesn't accumulate in
the food chain.

   Venezuela is already pumping more oil
to help make up the shortage following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
President Carlos Andres Perez announced Tuesday.
   Earlier Tuesday, the nation's defense minister announced
Venezuela is preparing to step up security at its oil installations
against possible sabotage.
   Perez's statement was Venezuela's first official admission that
it was already pumping more oil to help fill Iraq and Kuwait's
embargoed supply.
   ``Our country is already producing additional oil for
inventories to be sold to our clients, particularly those in Latin
America,'' Perez was quoted as saying in a news release.
   Perez on Tuesday did not not disclose how much extra oil
Venezuela is pumping, but said the nation can increase its output
by 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day.
   Venezuela joined nine other OPEC nations in supporting in
principle an agreement to produce more oil. Perez said an OPEC
announcement on the issue was expected Wednesday in Vienna, where
cartel officials were meeting.
   Defense Minister Hector Jurado Toro said Tuesday that the
National Guard is ready to move on the operation if the Iraq-Kuwait
conflict escalates.
   ``This is a good idea even for routine situations, and more so
in this situation, in which at any moment someone, for whatever
reasion, could decide to take an act of sabotage against some of
the installations,'' he said in a statement transmitted by the
government news agency Venpres.
   Jurado Toro avoided mentioning Iraq, which vehemently opposes
increasing oil production to cover the blockaded supply.
   Venezuela has been one of the staunchest proponents in the
13-member cartel of increased oil output.
   Venezuela usually produces about 2 million barrels per day, in
compliance with its quota in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Industry sources warned Tuesday that it would take about three
months for Venezuela to reach 500,000 barrels of extra daily output.

<HEAD>Fish Species Returning Up Cleaner Ohio River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAUDIA COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The paddlefish _ a primitive, long-snouted
source of $50-a-pound caviar _ is swimming farther up the Ohio
River as pollution is reduced and water quality improves.
   Biologists are finding the paddlefish and other
pollution-sensitive species in the upper Ohio, which had been
shunned by such fishes until the 1980s.
   ``The passport has been cleaner waters,'' Ronald Preston, an
aquatic biologist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
Wheeling, W.Va., field office, said Tuesday.
   Preston plans to present his findings Thursday at a meeting of
the American Fisheries Society. About 900 fishery managers,
biologists and scientists are attending the four-day meeting, which
began Monday in Pittsburgh.
   Many species of fish disappeared from the river during the first
half of the century when industry polluted the water, said William
Pearson, fishery biology professor at the University of Louisville.
In the past decade, waste has been treated more thoroughly before
being discharged.
   Still, industries, municipalities and government regulators are
not off the hook, fish experts cautioned.
   ``We still have a legacy of pollution,'' Preston said. ``While
we've cleaned up the easy things to clean up, we've got a ways to
go.''
   He said efforts must now focus on runoff from agricultural
pesticides and construction sites, storm discharge and cargo
spillage.
   Other species returning to the upper third of the Ohio River are
the mooneye and the slenderhead darter. Both are food for other
fishes, not humans.
   ``Their value is in what they represent, cleaner water,''
Preston said.
   The paddlefish, though, is a highly commercialized fish prized
especially for its roe, which can fetch $50 a pound. A single
female paddlefish may produce 10 pounds of roe.
   Having moved south to escape pollution, the paddlefish limited
itself to Louisville and points south until the past few years. Now
it's being found as far north as Cincinnati, more than 100 miles
upstream from Louisville.
   The paddlefish is expanding its river habitat by about 20 miles
a year, Pearson said.
   Large-mouth bass, crappie and walleye never left the upper Ohio
completely and now are thriving in numbers to attract aficionados
of sport fishing. Bass even have moved into the Allegheny and
Monongahela rivers, which merge to form the Ohio at Pittsburgh.
   The fish may not be good to eat because of continued pollution
from PCBs and chlordane. The two toxic substances are present in
fishes in many western Pennsylvania rivers and are eliminated from
the body slowly, if at all. States regularly issue public warnings
about what is and isn't edible.
   So the Ohio isn't likely to return to the pristine conditions of
the early 1800s, when ichthyologists first documented its diversity
of fish. Some species won't be seen again without being
artificially re-introduced.
   ``Some of them got pushed over the edge and can't be brought
back without extra measures,'' Pearson said.

<HEAD>Student Opposed To Cat Dissection To Learn Anatomy With Human
Cadaver</HEAD>

   A community college nursing student who
refused to dissect a cat for religious reasons said Tuesday she had
resolved her dispute by agreeing to watch the dissection of a human
cadaver at another school.
   ``The difference is the person died of natural causes and
donated their body to science,'' said Roseann Charron, 31. ``They
do not raise people and kill them and sell them to universities.
   ``Perfectly good cats are raised specifically for that purpose,
stolen and killed and sold,'' she said.
   Charron's dispute with the Community College of Rhode Island
began in June 1989, when school officials told Charron she couldn't
complete her licensed practical nursing program unless she passed
the anatomy class, which requires dissecting a cat.
   Charron, a vegetarian and owner of two cats, filed a complaint
claiming that breeding animals for laboratory experiments violates
the Ten Commandments.
   Charron asked school officials to substitute a computer
simulation or a model instead of a cat. The two sides reached an
agreement in July 1989, but it fell through and she eventually
hired an attorney.
   ``This squares with her conscientious beliefs and is more
pertinent to her studies as well,'' said Charron's lawyer, Stephen
J. Fortunato.
   Charron said she received final confirmation Friday that she
could get credit for taking an anatomy class at the University of
Rhode Island in which students watch a human dissection.
   Charron said she ``really didn't think'' she would have to cut
open the cadaver at the university, but wasn't sure.
   Charron only took one class at the community college last year,
and is set for the university anatomy class and three nursing
classes there this semester.
   ``I'm actually very pleased with the alternative,'' Charron
said. ``It's certainly a good teaching technique.''
   College spokeswoman Lee Chartier said the school had no problem
with Charron's arrangement.
   ``This kind of thing will be handled on a case-by-case basis
should it come up again,'' Chartier said.
   University spokeswoman Linda Acciardo said Tuesday that Charron
had registered for the course. Classes start Sept. 5.

   Oil prices rebounded Tuesday from a slide a day
earlier, jumping almost $1 per barrel as traders speculated on
diplomatic efforts to resolve the Middle East crisis.
   Traders also were monitoring OPEC discussions that could lead to
boosts in crude oil production, offsetting the shortfall caused by
the international boycott of Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, however,
market strategists saw no news that could push it wildly in either
direction.
   ``It was such a collapse yesterday that it's getting its
breath,'' said Philip L. Dodge, an oil analyst with Nomura
Securities International Inc. ``OPEC has postponed their meeting,
maybe suggesting to some that they're not agreeing on ways to
increase production.''
   In Vienna, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries delayed formal endorsement of a plan for production
increases to give them more time to hear from absent members Iraq
and Libya.
   The price of light sweet crude, the benchmark grade of oil, rose
97 cents to $27.88 per barrel for October contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .97 cent to
88.53 cents per gallon for September delivery, while home heating
oil rose 1.42 cents to 79.52 cents per gallon on September
contracts. Natural gas barely budged, closing at $1.500 per 1,000
cubic feet, compared with Monday's close of $1.502 on October
contracts.
   Without cataclysmic news coming from the Persian Gulf, traders
pondered the diplomatic nuances and reports of prospects for peace
in the region, a crucial provider of petroleum to the United States
and other developed nations.
   By some reckonings, 4 million barrels of oil a day has been
removed from the market because of a U.S.-led boycott of crude from
Iraq and Iraq-occupied Kuwait.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar planned to meet
Thursday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to discuss the
turmoil that has developed since Iraq seized Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Earlier speculation about a nonviolent solution to the crisis
was a partial cause of Monday's $4-per-barrel drop in the price of
crude, but some petroleum strategists said Tuesday the market may
have overreacted.
   ``It's almost as if the market has declared peace, but in
reality we're still missing 4 million barrels a day of oil,'' said
Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
   Others predicted prices would fluctuate, pending outcome of
Perez de Cuellar's mission.
   ``It's just a very choppy market at this point,'' said Ed
Kevelson, of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``I think it will chop
around for a couple of days. You'll probably see a lot of emphasis
put on that meeting.''
   After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute
released figures showing that the U.S. stockpile and imports of
gasoline declined sharply as the Persian Gulf crisis turned 3 weeks
old, while the stockpile and imports of crude oil were slightly
higher.
   Gasoline imports dropped from 545,000 barrels per day to 287,000
barrels per day for the week ending Aug. 24, compared with imports
of 515,000 barrels per day a year earlier, API said.
   The nation's stockpile of gasoline was 210.9 million barrels for
the week ending Aug. 24, vs. 214.0 million barrels a week earlier
and 223.5 million barrels a year earlier, the trade group said in
its weekly report.
   Analysts following oil prices had predicted supplies of gasoline
would tighten because of the loss of three modern Kuwaiti
refineries. Other refineries that can boost output are unable to
produce gasoline that meets U.S. standards, they said.
   The nation's crude oil stocks rose slightly, from 375.7 million
barrels to 376.6 million barrels, up from 337.3 million barrels a
year earlier, API said. Crude oil imports were up to 6.6 million
barrels per day, compared with a rate of 6.5 million barrels per
day a week earlier and a year earlier.
   API said the nation's refineries were running at 92.4 percent of
capacity, up from 92.3 percent a week earlier and 91.2 percent a
year earlier.

   U.S. Navy warships enforcing the U.N.
embargo against Iraq stopped two cargo ships and crewmen boarded
one in the Gulf of Aqaba before allowing them to proceed to Jordan,
shipping sources said Tuesday.
   In Washington, the Pentagon said the American naval flotilla

economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations has brought
shipping to and from Iraq ``virtually to a halt.''

ships have been ``intercepted,'' Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams
said. Williams said this total includes ships identified or
signalled to, or whose intent and cargo has been learned.
   He told reporters ``only a handful of ships have actually been
boarded,'' defining that as less than 10.
   On Aug. 18, two Navy frigates fired warning shots across the
bows of two Iraqi tankers, but both ships refused to stop.
   The London-based Lloyd's shipping agency, which monitors
maritime traffic worldwide, said the Navy boarded the Greek-owned
container ship Zorba Express and stopped the Indian-owned vessel
Kalidas on Monday near the mouth to the Gulf of Aqaba. Both ships
were allowed to proceed when the Navy determined the cargoes were
not bound for Iraq.
   The agency also said that on Sunday, the U.S. Navy denied the
French container ship Paris entry into the Gulf of Aqaba. It did
not give details.
   U.S. media reports said Monday that Iraq has issued new orders
to its ships, telling them to stop if challenged and not to defy
U.S. warships.
   The Iraqi ambassador to Washington, Mohammed Sadiq al-Mashat,
appeared to confirm the report on ABC TV's ``Nightline.''
   ``We are doing our best ourselves to defuse the tension _ I
mean, the order that we have given to the captains of the ship not
to resist...,'' he said.
   A Western diplomat in the gulf, without giving specifics, said
the Iraqis did seem to be folowing that order. However, gulf-based
shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were unaware of any Iraqi-flagged ships currently at sea in either
the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea.
   The United Nations ordered the embargo on trade with Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council agreed Saturday
that military force could be used to uphold the sanctions against
Iraq.
   Jordan's port of Aqaba, once a main trading point for Iraqi
goods, has been brought to a near standstill by the U.N. sanctions.
   Lloyd's said the port is almost empty and that the trucking
fleets operating out of the port are almost idle. It said Jordan
has ordered all shipping agents not to transit Iraqi cargoes
through Aqaba with the exception of food, pharmaceuticals and
medical products.
   About 70 warships from Western countries are participating in
the multinational force in the gulf, the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean.

   John Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff,
shared his experience in managing the White House bureaucracy with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Tuesday, Soviet
media reported.
   Sununu is in Moscow this week at the invitation of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to help Kremlin leaders improve their office
procedures and tame the huge Soviet bureaucracy.
   The U.S. Embassy said the meetings would be closed to American
reporters, and that neither Sununu nor members of his entourage
would be available to the press.
   But the Soviet press agency Tass said Sununu and Shevardnadze
``discussed exchanges of experience in organizing the work of state

between the two countries.''
   Tass said U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock also took part in the

   A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee has
ordered the closing of the 101-year-old Hotel Barre, which catered
to three presidents but has been operating under Chapter 11
protection since February 1989.
   Trustee David M. Nickless ordered the shutdown Monday, saying he
saw little chance of the stately hotel reopening during the
liquidation.
   ``It sounds like they would continue to lose money and that
would put the creditors further in the hole,'' Nickless said.
   Built in 1889 in a style that suggested a Mississippi River
steamboat, the three-story hotel had 36 guest rooms, 11 fireplaces
and an elegant dining room. Guests included Theodore Roosevelt,
Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge.
   It was sold in 1985 for $265,000 to new owners who recreated its
lavish Victorian atmosphere.
   The hotel has been listed for sale since 1987 for $2.6 million
unfurnished, or $3.6 million furnished.

   A judge Tuesday gave the Roman Catholic Church
permission to exhume the remains of a former Haitian slave proposed
for canonization as the United States' first black saint, nearly
weeping as she read her ruling.
   The Archdiocese of New York wants to exhume Pierre Toussaint's
remains for identification by a pathologist and church officials,
said Monsignor Robert O'Connell, who heads the cause for
Toussaint's canonization.
   Church records show that Toussaint, who died a free man in New
York in 1853 at age 87, was buried at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral
on Mulberry Street in what is now Little Italy.
   O'Connell said Toussaint's remains eventually will be buried
beneath the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, where
all New York archbishops and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen are interred.
   Acting state Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob granted permission to
exhume Toussaint's body.
   ``It is rare that this court has an opportunity to participate
in such a historic event, if only tangentially,'' Gangel-Jacob said.
   Court papers referred to Toussaint as ``a model of charity'' who
is considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he helped
the needy for 66 years before formal systems of assistance existed.
   Gangel-Jacob said Toussaint had lived ``a long and apparently
virtuous life,'' giving money to the poor and nursing the ill
during yellow fever plagues that swept New York City.
   ``In those times the only consolation may have been the miracles
of faith and trust,'' Gangel-Jacob said, struggling to keep from
weeping.
   After pausing as her voice broke, Gangel-Jacob said, ``Indeed,
for the thousands of victims of the scourge of AIDS, Alzheimer's
disease, melanoma and other currently incurable diseases, the same
may be true today.''
   The judge refused to tell reporters what had moved her as she
read her decision.
   O'Connell said the church is investigating two miracles
attributed to Toussaint. One involves a Haitian man who claimed he
was cured of lung and stomach cancers by praying to Toussaint. The
second is claimed by a Miami woman who said Toussaint cured her
breast cancer.
   According to a church brochure, Toussaint was born into slavery
in Haiti in 1766. At 21, he was brought to New York by John Berard
du Pithon and his family, for whom he worked as a slave. He was
apprenticed to a women's hairdresser.
   After Pithon died, his family fell into poverty. Toussaint
secretly supported them for 20 years until the widow, Marie,
remarried. She repaid him by arranging for his freedom.
   Toussaint then bought the freedom of several other slaves,
including Juliette Noel, whom he married in 1811.
   O'Connell said canonization by the Congregation for the Causes
of Saints in Rome could take years, and will involve lengthy
investigations and hearings.

<TEXT>
   About 80,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel
so far in 1990, Israel Television reported Tuesday. A government
official said the influx this month is expected to be the largest
in more than three decades.
   The number of Soviet immigrants has reached 16,000 so far this
month, the state-run television said.
   Gad Ben-Ari, a spokesman for the quasi-government Jewish Agency
that helps handle immigration, said the August total is expected to
reach some 17,000 to 18,000, a record monthly figure since the
1950s.
   Israeli officials expect a total of some 150,000 Soviet Jews to
immigrate by the end of the year. Ben-Ari said the Soviet
immigration rate does not appear to be affected by the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's loosening of emigration, the Soviet
Union has issued visas for 234,000 people to emigrate during the
first seven months of 1990, more than twice as many as in the same
period last year, Soviet officials said Tuesday.
   Most of the Soviet visas _ 132,400 _ were issued to people
wanting to go to Israel. The second largest number, 73,400, went to
West Germany. About 16,800 left for Greece, and 5,300 for the
United States, according to figures released by the Soviet Interior
Ministry's visa office.
   Rudolf Kuznetsov, head of the visa office, complained at a news
conference in Moscow that the office has run short of blank
passports to issue to Soviet citizens wishing to travel abroad. He
said the Soviet enterprise Goznak can supply only one-fifth the
required number of blanks, and the state would have to allocate $16
million to solve the problem.
   Permission to travel abroad, and particularly to the West, used
to be very difficult for ordinary Soviet citizens to obtain. Under
Gorbachev's reforms, increasing numbers of people have been able to
see the world.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel warned
Tuesday it will take vigilance and care to keep the ethnic
minorities of Central Europe from turning on each other as
``proxies for the totalitarian system.''
   Some groups are seeking a focus for their anger after
discovering the extent of ``the awful legacy left us'' by decades
of Communist rule, Havel said during a debate about ethnic
conflicts at a conference in Norway's capital.
   The four-day seminar, which began Sunday, was called by 1986
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel to explore the roots of
ethnic, religious and political hatred and how to overcome it.
About 70 world leaders, Nobel laureates and activists were
attending the gathering.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, who wants to lead his
Baltic republic out of the Soviet Union, agreed that
long-suppressed ethnic conflicts have boiled to the surface in
countries where democracy is taking hold.
   ``Maybe this is why Western Europe, even now ... strangely
interprets Eastern Europe's spring as a winter of frightening
instability,'' Landsbergis said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said in order to maintain
peace, the world must cooperate to enforce international law. He
had a timely example to offer _ the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``This is an appeal for courage,'' Mitterrand said, reminding
listeners of Nazi expansionism in World War II. ``We must refuse
from the outset (Iraq's) use of force.''
   He said France is fully committed _ with air, sea and land
forces _ to countering Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait
and threats to foreigners trapped in the two countries.
   ``International law must prevail over force, over antagonism,''
he said.
   He pointed out that Western Europe, despite two conflagrations
this century, had found peace through economic cooperation.
   ``We could call it a victory over hate,'' Mitterrand said.
   Mitterrand urged the eventual inclusion in the European
Community of East Bloc nations that have abandoned authoritarian
Communist systems.
   Havel said he was optimistic that the ethnic groups of Eastern
Europe could eventually live in peace.
   ``If I speak of the nationalist hatred in Central and Eastern
Europe, I am not talking about it as our certain future but as a
potential threat,'' he said.
   After four decades spent in the Communist mold, ethnic groups
are rediscovering their individuality, he said.
   ``After all they have gone through, they feel a natural need to
make their existence quickly visible,'' he said.
   Havel said it will take care to keep the ethnic groups from
turning on each other as ``proxies for the totalitarian system.''

   A neighbor complained, the police were
unsympathetic, and finally a sore gum stopped Liam Kite's pursuit
of a world record for playing the French horn.
   It's something he wouldn't try again, he said Tuesday _ ``not in
the foreseeable future.''
   The stunt was organized to raise money for the Skegness junior
band, which has more members than instruments, Kite said.
   The 25-year-old optician began his pursuit of the record of 32
hours at 11 a.m. Saturday, playing ``All Through the Night'' from
one of his pile of hymn books and attended by the required number
of witnesses.
   At about 7 p.m., he said, a neighbor had wearied of the music _
Kite had reached ``Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven'' _ and
called the police, who ordered him to move on.
   During his permitted five-minute break, the only venue he could
find was a toilet in a nearby amusement arcade. Kite, his
time-keeper, his two official witnesses and the keeper of his three
horns selected cubicles and pressed on until they could move to a
theater he had hired for 10 p.m.
   Meanwhile, he said, he cut his gum. It didn't bother him at
first, he said, but it started to throb overnight. ``It was very
painful indeed,'' he said.
   At 4:30 a.m. Sunday, after playing ``Nearer My God to Thee,''
Kite gave up _ more than 15 hours short of his goal.
   The record would have been unofficial. The Guinness Book of
Records has entries for longest performances on an accordion (85
hours), bagpipes (120 hours), flute (61 hours), guitar (300 hours)
and electric organ (440 hours), but nothing for the horn.
   For the Skegness junior band, however, it paid off.
   ``We think it looks in the region of 600 to 700 pounds
($1,200-$1,400), so that's going to be quite nice,'' Kite said.

   President F.W. de Klerk told
church leaders Tuesday he would investigate charges that police
sided against supporters of the African National Congress in recent
township violence.
   Black leaders have blamed police for fueling the two weeks of
savage street fights in black townships around Johannesburg that
killed more than 500 people.
   Police said two black men were killed in unrest Tuesday, but the
townships were peaceful for a fourth straight day following a
government crackdown.
   Also Tuesday, police raided the headquarters of South Africa's
largest labor federation and arrested its secretary general, Jay
Naidoo, and two others. The three were charged with kidnapping,
robbery and assault. All three were later released on bail, and
Naidoo denied the charges.
   The raid followed a news conference at Naidoo's Congress of
South African Trade Unions, where officials presented a man they
said had been spying for the police, the independent South African
Press Association reported.
   A delegation of church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Frank Chikane, head of the South African
Council of Churches, met in Pretoria with de Klerk and Adriaan
Vlok, the law and order minister.
   After the two-hour meeting, Chikane told journalists the
president had pledged to investigate charges that police aided
Zulu-based Inkatha supporters in the fighting against Xhosas and
other blacks loyal to the African National Congress.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela, Tutu and other anti-apartheid figures
have said police bias toward Inkatha inflamed the situation. They
accused police of disarming and scattering ANC supporters while
allowing Zulus to weapons.
   Mandela on Tuesday renewed charges that the government was not
moving to settle weeks of bloody unrest.
   ``The police are inflaming the conflict,'' the ANC leader said
after arriving in the Algerian capital for meetings with President
Chadli Bendjedid and other officials.
   Government officials have denied the charges. De Klerk has
previously said individual officers may have acted improperly, but
the police force as a whole followed orders to be impartial.
   The fighting erupted Aug. 12 in Johannesburg area townships and
raged for two weeks until the government declared a de facto state
of emergency and poured in more police and soldiers.
   It was considered the worst unrest since the mid-1980s.
Officials said more than 18,000 township dwellers were left
homeless by the fighting.
   The press association reported Tuesday that analysts estimated
it would cost $80 million to replace the 2,000 houses, shops and
factories destroyed.
   Chikane said Tuesday's meeting with de Klerk also covered
compensation for victims of the violence and the problems of
migrant worker hostels in the townships. Most of the clashes
involved hostel residents clashing with rival township dwellers.
   Tutu said de Klerk had treated the group as respected leaders,
unlike previous presidents.
   ``The difference between him and the others is there was no
finger-wagging,'' Tutu said. ``We give him credit for taking
seriously the issues before us.''
   Police said a 20-year-old man was shot to death Tuesday in
Vosloorus, southeast of Johannesburg, and a man was stabbed to
death in Umgababa, in the eastern province of Natal. More than
5,000 blacks have died in Inkatha-ANC clashes in Natal over the
past five years.
   The government and many neutral observers portray the conflict
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the
ANC and Inkatha.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has blamed the ANC for
instigating the fighting, saying the ANC wants to crush all
opposition. The ANC contends Inkatha spread the fighting from Natal
to the Johannesburg townships to broaden its constituency.
   Both groups oppose apartheid but differ on the shape of a future
South Africa.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
5 million whites dominate politics and the economy, and blacks have
no voice in national affairs. De Klerk says he wants to end
apartheid and negotiate a black-white power-sharing agreement with
the ANC and other opposition groups.

   Forty-seven wives and
children of U.S. diplomats reached American soil Tuesday evening
after three hard days on the road and in the air putting the perils
of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait behind them. ``God bless America,''
proclaimed one leader of the group glad to be home.
   A chartered jet carrying the 20 women and 27 children touched
down almost exactly 48 hours after their 13-car convoy crossed the
Iraqi border into Turkey.
   Many of the youngsters carried stuffed animals as they descended
onto the tarmac at Andrews Air Force base near Washington to board
buses with their families for an undisclosed hotel. Many of the
wives left behind husband who were denied permission by the Iraqi
government to accompany their families home.
   Earlier in the day, the State Department said Iraqi authorities
were continuing to round up Americans, taking nine more into
custody. Iraq also informed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that a
56-year old American died of a heart attack in the port city of
Basra.
   Luz Marina Colwell, wife of the the U.S. consul in Kuwait,
William Colwell, fought back tears in a planeside conversation with
reporters thanking the Bush administration for bringing the group
home.
   ``During the present crisis we learned to know each other, to
care for each other and we became a big family,'' Ms. Colwell said.
   ``But our hearts are left in Kuwait and Baghdad with all our
husbands, members of our families, our private American citizens
and members of the international community left behind,'' she added.
   ``We had to keep being strong and keep our hearts very high. God
bles America,'' she concluded.
   Left behind in Iraq where three young American men, children of
U.S. diplomats in Kuwait who were denied permission by Iraqi
authorities to accompany the group home when it was realized they
were over 18.
   An additional 54 or 55 U.S. personnel, mostly men, who had been
stationed in Kuwait remained behind in Baghdad and are still
seeking permission to leave.
   The Americans left Kuwait late Thursday for Baghdad. They left
Baghdad Sunday morning and drove about 20 hours in desert heat
through Iraq before crossing into Turkey at 6 p.m. EDT Sunday.
   Five of the 52 who arrived at the border did not make the flight
to Washington.
   The U.S. embassy in Baghdad was informed that Iraq plans to
expel an unspecified number of American envoys in response to the
State Department decision Monday to order 36 Iraqi Embassy staff
members out of the United States by Thursday.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said six
Americans were arrested in Iraq and three in Kuwait since Monday,
bringing the total to 70 _ 48 in Iraq and 22 in Kuwait.
   The dead American was in Iraqi custody at the time he died. Ms.
Tutwiler was unable to identify him but said Iraqi officials have
agreed to conduct an autopsy. U.S. officials asked that a competent
physician chosen by the embassy be present and that the remains be
delivered to U.S. custody as soon as possible.
   She said the death ``underscores the barbaric nature of Iraqi
policy towards foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait, and makes a
lie of Iraq's claim that they are all well treated and in no
danger.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi officials have not responded to U.S.
requests concerning 15 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait with special
medical needs who the administration believes should be allowed to
leave the country immediately.
   The dead American was not among the 15, she said.
   There was no immediate State Department response to the
announcement of President Saddam Hussein that all foreigners who
are women and children in Iraq will be allowed to leave.
   As for the Iraqi decision to expel U.S. diplomats, Ms. Tutwiler
said the United States was awaiting clarification of the Iraqi
demand. The head of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, was
informed of the decision Tuesday morning by Iraq's chief of
protocol.
   Wilson also was informed that unspecified restrictions would be
imposed on embassy funds.
   The Iraqi action occurred less than 24 hours after the State
Department ordered a reduction in the Iraqi Embassy staff here from
55 to 19 and imposed strict travel restrictions on those left
behind.
   The U.S. action was prompted by an Iraqi demand that the United
States and other countries close their embassies in Kuwait. That
order has been widely ignored.
   For the second day in a row, Ms. Tutwiler said the State
Department has received reports of additional Americans having fled
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Two weeks ago the State Department estimated that there were
2,500 Americans in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq who were not free to
leave.
   Since Americans have departed the two countries over the past
two weeks, those figures are now obsolete. But no updated estimates
have been disclosed because the State Department has refused to say
how many have escaped.

   Defense sources disclosed Tuesday night that
the multinational forces are considering seeking a U.N. resolution
for an air blockade to stop sanction-busting flights to Baghdad.
   The sources believe the blockade, which would involve all of
Iraq's neighbors banning Iraqi-bound planes from their airspace,
would tighten the noose around Baghdad's war-ravaged economy.
   The move comes after reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
was building stores of grain and meat before his invasion of Kuwait.
   A senior defense source in the Middle East, speaking on
condition he was not identified, said: ``There is some evidence
that he has filled his granaries and ordered meat.
   ``It is alleged that before the invasion there may have been a
lot of early purchasing going on.''
   He added: ``There is no evidence that he is running short.''
   Any aerial blockade would heighten tension in the Persian Gulf
but would also help prevent an inevitable and fatal split in global
solidarity against Iraq should sanctions take too long to bite.
   The British are confident they have the right to impose both
naval and air blockades under the U.N. charter but accept other
nations may want a resolution specifically covering action against
sanction-busters.
   On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
backing use of force to impose the naval blockade.
   Earlier Tuesday, at a news conference at Saudi Arabia's massive
Dhahran air base, British Defense Secretary Tom King said British
forces could remain in the gulf even if Saddam bows to world
pressure and quits Kuwait.
   After visiting Britain's vanguard squadron of Tornado fighters
and holding discussions with the local Saudi air commander, Prince
Turki, King hinted at a prolonged stand-off in the sand between
Iraq and the multinational forces.
   Pledging to achieve Kuwait's liberation and the restoration of
its ousted rulers, by peaceful means if possible, King said: ``We
are here to achieve those objectives but we would need confirmation
that the situation could not deteriorate again.
   ``We would want to ensure that there was a secure and stable
situation.''
   Britain has three squadrons of Tornadoes and Jaguars, 11
warships and support vessels, Nimrod aircraft and 150 soldiers from
the Signals Regiment deployed in the gulf.
   King refused to rule out any military option and a Ministry of
Defense team is assessing deployment of more forces during while
King meets gulf leaders on his three-day regional tour.

   The California Assembly on Tuesday
soundly rejected a proposal which urged schools to teach that the
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was a military
necessity.
   The resolution, introduced by a legislator who served in the
Marines, maintained it's wrong to teach that Japanese-Americans
were put in ``concentration camps.'' It portrayed the
``relocation,'' as it was called at the time, as a reasonable
reaction of people frightened by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.
   The measure was intended to counteract another non-binding
resolution approved by the state Legislature last year that called
the wartime detentions a human rights violation driven in part by
racism.
   The new resolution was rejected by the Assmebly 60-4. Only the
author, Republican Assemblyman Gil Ferguson, a retired Marine spoke
in favor of it. Eleven lawmakers opposed it with emotional and
anecdotal speeches.
   ``It unnecessarily reopens wounds that should and must be
allowed to heal,'' Minority Leader Ross Johnson, a Republican, said
in leading the bipartisan opposition.
   Ferguson's measure was aimed at one by Democratic Assemblywoman
Jackie Speier, that the Legislature passed last year.
   Speier's measure, which isn't a law but an expression of the
Legislature's opinion, urged the state and its school districts to
use textbooks that show the internment of Japanese-Americans was
``a violation of human rights rather than an act of military
necessity.''
   Speier's resolution noted a conclusion of the federal Commission
on Wartime Relocations and Internment of Civilians about internment
of more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans in fenced, guarded camps.
The internment, the commission said, ``was not justified by
military necessity and the decisions which followed from it _
detention, ending detention and ending exclusion _ were not driven
by analysis of military conditions.''
   Speier's resolution added that, ``The broad historical causes
which shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria and
a failure of political leadership.''
   Ferguson's resolution urged the state and school districts ``to
adopt a broad range of instructional materials that discuss and
reference these events and facts ... so as to offer California
students an honest, objective and balanced education concerning
this period in our history.''
   Ferguson's proposal stated, ``It is simply untrue that
Japanese-Americans were interned in concentration camps during
World War II.''
   ``The people of California and the designated war zone areas had
good reason to fear an invasion attempt after the surprise attack
on Pearl Harbor as Japanese submarines cruised off our coast,
barrage balloons flew over our harbor areas and great parts of the
zone existed under blackout conditions,'' the resolution said.
   It also said any history that ``omits the attack on Pearl Harbor
and the war as a major factor in our nation's relocation policy
unfairly denigrates the character of a generation of Americans,
including all who fought in that war or who merely were alive at
the time.''
   Ferguson said Speier was trying to rewrite history.
   ``For the first time in the history of America, a bunch of
politicians are acting as they do in Russia or China and revising
history and telling teachers how they should teach,'' Ferguson said.
   ``I admire and respect Japanese-Americans,'' he said. ``I agree
it was a tragic period in our history. I'm sure there was racism in
American, just as there is now and is in every country in the
world.''
   Arguing against the measure, Johnson said: ``What happened was
wrong if even one U.S. citizen was denied his or her constitutional
rights or freedom not because of what they did but because of who
they were. It should never have happened. It must never be allowed
to happen again.''
   ``This measure (Ferguson's resolution) says somehow if you're
really upset and really concerned, it's OK to violate your civil
rights,'' added Republican Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush.

<HEAD>Police Seize 2,600 Pounds of Cocaine in Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police seized about 2,600 pounds of pure
cocaine and arrested eight people in a raid on a jungle laboratory
in southeastern Colombia, a national police bulletin said Tuesday.
   The drug bust Monday was the biggest since President Cesar
Gaviria took office Aug. 7.
   A special anti-drug police unit in U.S.-made helicopters swooped
on the lab and confiscated a DC-3 airplane, two vehicles, three
electrical plants and 11 tons of chemicals used to process cocaine,
the report said.
   It said police also discovered three clandestine landing strips.
   Security forces have seized about 43 tons of cocaine so far this
year. The figure for all of 1989 was 33 tons.
   Police in southwestern Colombia last weekend destroyed a
sophisticated drug-processing laboratory capable of producing about
1,500 pounds of cocaine a week, according to a police statement
broadcast on Caracol radio network.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels supply much of the cocaine
consumed in the United States and Europe.
   Authorities released Fabio Ochoa on Tuesday, the father of three
reputed leaders of the Medellin cartel, his wife said.
   In a statement Tuesday over local TV, Margoth Ochoa said she and
her husband were detained overnight at Ochoa's luxury ranch on the
outskirts of Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. She said
about 50 workers also were detained.
   The Ochoas' sons _ Jorge Luis, Juan David and Fabio _ are
presumed leaders of the cartel.
   She said security forces in helicopters descended on the ranch
Monday _ ``Apparently they were looking for my son Jorge Luis.''
   Jorge Luis Ochoa, 41, is considered No. 2 man in the cartel,
after Pablo Escobar, and is wanted on drug trafficking charges in
the United States.
   The senior Ochoa, a lifelong rancher, faces no criminal charges.
   Cartel leaders have been blamed for killing about 500 Colombians
in the past year, including three presidential candidates. The
Ochoa brothers, along with Escobar, remain at large despite a
police and army dragnet to catch them.
   The government's yearlong war with drug traffickers appeared to
be winding down Tuesday as barricades against car bombs were
removed from around the capital's government buildings.
   No major traffickers have been arrested, and the cocaine is
still flowing to the United States.
   Both the government and the Medellin cartel have moved toward
defusing the conflict.
   President Gaviria has said nothing publicly about easing the war
against the traffickers, but signs are clear he is looking for some
sort of understanding with the Medellin cartel toward ending the
violence.
   The cartel declared a truce July 27, 11 days before Gaviria took
office.
   On Aug. 7, Gaviria hinted in his inaugural speech he might end
extradition of trafficking suspects to the United States if the
cartel ended its campaign of terrorism.
   On Aug. 16, Justice Minister Fabio Giraldo said a state of siege
would be lifted if the cartel halted its terrorism, and that the
next step would be an end to extradition.
   On Sunday, Bogota Mayor Martin Caicedo said police and private
guards for government officials and businessmen must start obeying
traffic laws.
   Escort vehicles crammed with guards toting submachine guns and
shotguns have been allowed to force traffic to the side of the road
and disregard traffic lights and speed limits. Pedestrians have to
run for their lives when they find the bulletproof cars and escort
vehicles tearing down streets.
   Ending extraditions would probably be the biggest single
conciliatory gesture toward the Medellin cartel. Drug traffickers
stand in dread of being extradited. In Colombia, they have been
able to threaten or bribe their way out of trouble.

   Fear and anger swept through the
University of Florida on Tuesday as students reacted to mounting
evidence that five young people had fallen prey to a serial killer.
   ``We want answers, not double talk,'' a female student told city
Police Chief Wayland Clifton at one of two counseling and
information sessions held by police and university officials.
   Hundreds of students left school and went home temporarily, many
at their parents' urging, after the bodies of a young woman and a
young man were discovered Tuesday, school officials said. Most at
the 34,000-student university stayed and continued with classes.
   The bodies of two young women were discovered Sunday and a third
on Monday. All five were killed at off-campus apartment complexes
that house students.
   Reinforcements from the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement and other agencies poured into town.
They patrolled the campus and dozens of apartment complexes where
many of the 20,000 students live off campus.
   Julie Basch, an 18-year-old student at nearby Santa Fe Community
College, said she was returning to her home in Orlando. Her parents
``told me I'm coming home,'' she said.
   A junior journalism student at the university, who refused to
identify herself, said her father was coming in from Tallahassee to
bring her a gun he'd bought for her.
   ``I'll stay for a while, but I may drop out this semester,'' she
said.
   More than 1,200 students jammed a student center auditorium to
hear Clifton, university President John Lombardi and others explain
the killings and outline precautions they should take.
   Clifton came under fire from students at the two hour-long
meetings for holding back information on the killings and refusing
to say whether break-ins were involved.
   Police said there were no signs of forcible entry in the
apartment of the first two victims, but Alachua County officials
have declined to discuss the method of entry in the other two
apartments.
   ``At least tell us that so we can know what we should do,'' said
student Karyn James. ``Here we are buying all kinds of locks and
deadbolts, and we don't even know whether we should.''
   ``You're not giving us enough information!'' a male student
yelled at the chief, expressing the frustration of others in the
audience.
   Police identified the victims late Tuesday. Three of the young
women were university students and the fourth woman was from Santa
Fe Community College. The male victim was an incoming student at
Santa Fe.
   Clifton, the sheriff's office and the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement refused to give specifics of how they died. Officials
said they didn't want to release information that would hamper
their investigation.
   Clifton said there was a lot of physical evidence that pointed
to one or two suspects. Some of the bodies were mutilated, he said.
   While some of the students who live in Florida or nearby were
going home, others expressed concern because they could not.
   Carol McCormac, a graduate student in forestry from Scio, Ore.,
said she and her boyfriend had moved in with friends of his in
Gainesville.
   ``I just arrived a week ago,'' she said. ``Welcome to
Gainesville. ... I don't think we're getting enough answers.''
   ``People are all stressed out. ... They're scared,'' said Jacob
Mellonheim, 19. ``People are getting together, they're not staying
alone.''
   University officials arranged to provide temporary campus
housing at dormitory lounges and other buildings for any single
woman who did not want to stay by herself off-campus.
   The county Crisis Center and the University Counseling Service
provided special phone numbers and offered assistance to students.
   All students, particularly women, were told repeatedly to call
home to assure their parents they were all right.
   ``You know you're all right but your parents and friends don't
know you're all right. So please call home,'' said university
President Lombardi.

   Hurricanes beginning with G's and H's tend
to make people along the coast a little nervous. There was Hazel in
1954, Gracie in 1959, Gilbert _ which raked the Caribbean in 1988.
And then there was Hugo.
   It's no wonder people are keeping an eye on Gustav and Hortense,
and an ear to the phone at national hurricane central in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   ``People are saying, `It better not come hit us; we just got our
house put back together,' '' said Darryl Graham, an employee at
Isle of Palms Hardware.
   Many residents on the Isle of Palms are still living in houses
with plastic covering the holes left by last September's Hurricane
Hugo, which killed 29 people in South Carolina and caused an
estimated $5.9 billion in damage.
   ``Folks around (here) are planning to load everything up and
head out early if it even looks close, but we aren't selling
batteries and water yet,'' he said.
   Despite word from the National Weather Service that Hurricane
Gustav and Tropical Storm Hortense will skip the East Coast,
coastal residents are wary.
   Gustav, with winds of 105 mph, began turning north Sunday night,
and Hortense is continuing a northward path that should keep both
well out in the Atlantic Ocean, said Silvia Graff, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service's hurricane center in Coral
Gables.
   ``Fortunately, it looks like the steering currents will keep
both Gustav and Hortense away from the U.S. and the Caribbean
islands,'' Ms. Graff said.
   ``At least this time around, it looks like South Carolina is off
the hook.''
   Ms. Graff said weather service phones were ``ringing off the
hook,'' with many of the calls coming from South Carolina.
   Jackie Ford, a Lady's Island Marina dockmaster who is thought by
many in the area to have a sixth sense when it comes to predicting
the landfalls of large storms, said he spent most of Monday
puzzling over the storms' directions.
   ``I've got just one pin on the chart, and I don't have a good
feeling for it one way or the other,'' Ford said. ``It's a little
too early to tell, but I guarantee you we will be keeping an eye on
both of them.''
   Meteorologists watching Gustav believe it's unlikely the
hurricane will turn toward the U.S. East Coast as it makes its way
north.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Gustav's center was located near 22 degrees north
latitude and 58 degrees west longitude, or about 425 miles
northeast of Antigua. It was moving north at about 13 mph and was
expected to hold that course and speed through Wednesday.
   Tropical Storm Hortense remained a danger only to shipping. The
storm was centered near 23.2 degrees north latitude and 45.5
degrees west longitude, or about 1,420 miles west-northwest of the
Cape Verde islands. Little change in its strength was expected
either.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
top winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.

   Actor Raymond St. Jacques, known for his
roles in such movies as ``Black Like Me,'' ``The Evil That Men Do''
and ``Glory'' as well as the TV miniseries ``Roots,'' has died of
cancer. He was 60.
   St. Jacques died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at 1:30 p.m.
Monday, hospital spokeswoman Paula Correia said Tuesday. He had
been treated for cancer of lymph glands since entering the hospital
on July 30.
   In addition to his role as the drummer in the 1977 miniseries
``Roots,'' the character actor was in the TV films ``Search for the
Gods'' in 1975 and ``Secrets of Three Hungry Wives'' in 1978.
   He was also a familiar face on a variety of television shows and
most recently portrayed the judge on the syndicated TV show
``Superior Court.''
   St. Jacques appeared on ``MacGyver,'' ``Fantasy Island,'' ``Love
Boat,'' ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' ``Hunter'' and ``Starman,'' among
others.
   He was fluent in French and Italian, and appeared in theater
performances of ``The Man With the Golden Arm,'' ``Othello,''
``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Raisin in the Sun'' and ``Julius Caesar.''
   His motion picture credits included ``Black Like Me'' and ``The
Pawnbroker'' in 1964, ``Mister Moses'' in 1965, ``Mister Buddwing''
in 1966, ``The Comedians'' in 1967 and ``The Green Berets'' in 1968.
   He was also in ``Uptight'' and ``If He Hollers, Let Him Go'' in
1968, ``Change of Mind'' and ``Cotton Comes to Harlem'' in 1970,
``Cool Breeze'' in 1972, ``The Book of Numbers'' in 1973, ``Born
Again,'' ``Eyes of Laura Mars'' and ``The Private Files of J. Edgar
Hoover'' in 1978, ``Sweet Dirty Tony'' in 1981, ``The Evil That Men
Do'' in 1984, and ``Glory'' in 1989.
   St. Jacques is survived by his mother, Vivienne, and a sister,
Barbara Birt, both of New Haven, Conn. A funeral was planned at
Forest Lawn Memorial Park but arrangements were incomplete.

Refuge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oil exploration in an Alaska wildlife refuge
could help boost domestic production in response to the Persian
Gulf crisis, U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Tuesday.
   ``There is no reason why we should not explore in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge,'' Lujan said. ``It's self-defeating not
to have production.
   ``The less production, the more tankers you have. Oil spills are
due to tankers colliding,'' said the secretary, who was making a
working vacation swing through the West.
   A number of spills, including one in 1969 off Santa Barbara,
Calif., and the 1987 Pemex spill in the Gulf of Mexico, have come
from offshore oil rigs, and others have involved pipelines.
   Lujan said one possibility was limited exploration in 1 million
acres of the 18 million-acre refuge in Alaska's northeast corner
east of Prudhoe Bay, the site of North America's largest oil
discovery.
   Alaska's top elected officials also have endorsed exploration in
the refuge following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
   At a U.S. Energy Department hearing on long-range energy
planning in Fairbanks on Monday, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, a
Democrat, and Republicans Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young
testified in favor of granting leases for oil exploration in the
refuge.
   The refuge was established in 1960 and enlarged in 1980 to
protect caribou and other wildlife species. When Congress expanded
the refuge, it postponed any decision about oil exploration.
   Environmentalists said drilling in the refuge is not the
solution to the nation's appetite for foreign oil. Even if there is
a commercial quantity of oil there, it will do little to reduce
imports, the environmentalists said.
   Lujan said the standoff in the Middle East has not created a
national oil crisis which warrants unlimited exploration of
domestic reserves. But he said new test wells must be considered.
   ``Overseas oil one of these days is going to run out,'' he said.
   If oil is found in the refuge, it would take about seven years
before it would be available to American consumers, James Ross,
president and chief executive of BP America Inc., has said.
   Only one well has been drilled in the Alaskan refuge and its
findings are a closely held corporate secret. The oil industry
calls the refuge one of the best chances of finding a significant
domestic oil field.

<TEXT>
   The ship that caused the nation's worst oil
spill is ready for sea trials after a $30 million repair job to its
mangled hull, the repair company said Tuesday.
   The Exxon Mediterranean, formerly the former Exxon Valdez, has
been undergoing dock trials at a pier at National Steel &amp;
Shipbuilding Co. after being floated out of a dry dock last month.
   The ship, which was built at NASSCO and delivered to Exxon in
1986, was scheduled to depart early Wednesday for a week of sea
trials about 200 miles offshore, said NASSCO spokesman Fred Hallett.
   It had been undergoing repairs for 11 months.
   The tanker was renamed in July and Exxon officials said it would
be put into service in the Mediterranean. They denied that renaming
the tanker and sending it to the Mediterranean were related to the
massive spill.
   The ship spilled almost 11 million gallons of oil when it struck
a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, fouling
hundreds of miles of coastline and killing untold numbers of
wildlife.
   Exxon officials had said the vessel is too big for any U.S.
Pacific ports when fully loaded. They said declining production
from Alaskan oil fields have reduced the need for such large
tankers to be used on West Coast shipping routes.
   The tanker holds nearly 1.4 million barrels of crude. One barrel
contains 42 gallons.
   Exxon officials didn't return telephone calls about the ship
Tuesday.
   Workers replaced the single-hulled ship's mangled steel with
3,000 tons of new, inch-thick steel.
   Exxon officials had said last month that the ship would stop in
Singapore en route to ports in the Mediterranean, but the current
crisis in the Persian Gulf could alter some of those plans, Exxon
officials have said.

   Home Secretary David Waddington said Tuesday the
government is concerned by increased anti-Semitic activity and
desecrations of synagogues and Jewish cemeteries.
   Waddington told four members of the Board of Deputies of British
Jews that the government has a ``vigorous commitment to tackling
racial violence in all its forms.''
   The meeting came less than a week after vandals painted
swastikas, pagan symbols and racial slurs at the Gladstone Park
Holocaust Memorial in Dollis Hill, northwest London.
   Police say 27 incidents against Jews and Jewish property were
reported in greater London in the first half of 1990, a significant
rise from last year.
   Similar attacks were reported in mainland Europe, including one
at Carpentras, France, where fascists desecrated 34 graves and
exhumed a corpse.
   In a joint statement issued after the meeting, board president
Lionel Kopelowitz said the Jewish leaders expressed ``deep concern
at the number of incidents of vandalism.''

   President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday
that if Iraq withdraws from Kuwait, he would urge Western forces to
pull back from Saudi Arabia.
   ``For the foreigners to leave, the Iraqis must leave (Kuwait),''
Mubarak said. ``Then we Arabs will stand against the foreign
presence.''
   Mubarak spoke at at news conference after meeting with eight
U.S. senators led by Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``Leave Kuwait now,'' he said, in remarks apparently aimed at
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, ``and I will be the first to call
for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the region immediately.''
   Mubarak said he told the American lawmakers that efforts should
continue to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis peacefully. He said he
still hopes for a diplomatic settlement, despite Iraq's repeated
refusal to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``The American delegation tried to speak to me about war, but I
said I did not want to hear the word war and that we must find
peaceful means and must have patience,'' the president said,
speaking in Arabic.
   ``There is still hope. We are trying all the ways. We do not
want the Iraqi people annihilated,'' he said.
   Referring to the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia _ where
Egypt has also sent troops _ Mubarak said: ``We do not know if the
United States is planning a war or not.''
   Dole and other members of his delegation, including Sen. Sam
Nunn, said Mubarak made clear his optimism that peace can be won
through an international embargo against Iraq. They said they
agreed that it must be tried.
   ``We have to give it more time,'' Dole said. ``We have to pursue
every avenue.''
   Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services
Committee, concurred that it is ``important that we give the
embargo a chance to work.''

   The Security Council's condemnation of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the agreement by its five permanent
members on a Cambodian peace plan made August the finest month in
the U.N.'s history, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   ``This month began with a U.N. resolution, 660, condemning the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,'' said John Bolton, the U.S. State
Department undersecretary in charge of international organizations.
   ``That was followed with four more resolutions on that subject,
and is culminated today with the agreement of the five permament
members of a framework for a solution to Cambodia,'' he said.
   The adoption of the Cambodian peace plan makes ``this the most

   The Brazilian air force cashiered two
high-ranking officers and ordered an investigation into charges
that soldiers were tortured, the government said Tuesday.
   The commander of the Anapolis air force base, Col. Gildo
Fernandes de Sousa, and his assistant, Lt. Col. Ubirajara Fernandes
da Cunha, were removed from their posts, the Aeronautics Ministry
said in a communique.
   A military panel was appointed to investigate charges that four
soldiers were submitted to electric shocks, beatings and kickings
to confess the theft of two pistols.
   Rober Soares da Silva, one of the soldiers involved, appeared on
Brazilian television showing body bruises and cuts on his wrists.
Da Silva claimed he was handcuffed and beaten to admit the theft.
   The torture allegedly took place in the office of Lt. Col. da
Cunha, according to Veja magazibne, Brazil's biggest newsweekly,
which broke the story in this week's edition.
   The guns thought to be stolen turned up later. According to
Veja, another soldier had taken them to show to his father.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello called for an ``immediate and
rigorous'' investigation, presidential press spokesman Claudio
Humberto Rosa e Silva said.
   ``In Brazil, torture never again,'' the spokesman said.
   Torture was common during the 1964-1985 anti-Communist military
administration, when the government persecuted known and suspected
leftist opponents. A new constitution in 1988 banned torture and
made it a crime without bail.
   The Anapolis Air Force Base, 60 miles southwest of Brasilia, is
responsible for the protecting the air space of central Brazil. It
has 800 men and one the country's largest combat squadrons.

   The deployment of troops to the Persian Gulf has
given rise to scattered protests that are focusing more on
economics than on the political concerns expressed during the
Vietnam era.
   Many of the demonstrators say the soldiers are risking their
lives for oil companies and that the financially strapped nation
cannot afford the deployment.
   ``Hell no, we won't go, we won't die for Texaco,'' 200
protesters shouted Saturday outside the White House, echoing words
used by demonstrators during the Vietnam War but adding a twist:
the name of a U.S. oil company.
   Opposition to the Vietnam War in the '60s and '70s and to U.S.
military policy in Central America in the '80s focused on whether
the United States had the right to interfere in the politics of
other nations. Opponents of U.S. gulf policy, a minority according
to opinion polls, are centering their arguments on the morality of
intervention for economic ends.
   ``We have to tell each other that we will not kill and we will
not die for Exxon, for Gulf Petroleum,'' peace activist Becky
Minnich said last week during a meeting of 100 dissidents in
Minneapolis.
   The argument might get a sympathetic ear.
   An Associated Press poll conducted earlier this month said 86
percent of Americans believed the oil companies took advantage of
the Iraqi invasion and unfairly raised gasoline prices. The survey
of 1,004 adults had a margi of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, speaking at a news
conference in New York last week, called the U.S. military buildup
``aggression designed simply to dominate oil.''
   Another of the protesters' arguments is that America _ $4.16
trillion in debt _ cannot afford a massive troop deployment costing
billions of dollars.
   ``They now run up a military bill to the top of the sky and take
it out of federal housing money for Brooklyn,'' wrote Jimmy
Breslin, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for New York Newsday.
   Many protesters don't believe protecting Middle East oil from
Iraq is worth American lives.
   ``I kissed my son goodbye today,'' college professor Alex Molnar
wrote in a letter to Bush published in The New York Times. ``He is
a 21-year-old Marine. You have ordered him to Saudi Arabia. ... For
what? Cheap gas?''
   Images of soldiers boarding transport planes for the Middle East
have become a daily staple of television news, but not all are
going willingly.
   One serviceman, Marine Cpl. Jeffrey Paterson, said he will not
fight a war over oil and has filed for conscientious objector
status to prevent his deployment to the gulf. A Marine reservist,
Erik Glen Larsen, said Tuesday he would file for discharge as a
conscientious objector.
   ``I will refuse orders to ship me to Saudi Arabia to defend our
polluting, exploitive lifestyle,'' Larsen, a lance corporal, told
an audience of peace activists packed into a church in San
Francisco. They responded with a standing ovation.
   The AP poll said 64 percent of Americans supported deployment of
U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend it against a possible
Iraqi attack, while 22 percent were opposed. But the poll said 52
percent of Americans opposed using ground forces to push Iraq out
of Kuwait. Thirty-two percent favored such a move.
   If the United States is drawn into a war to force Iraq out of
Kuwait, which is the intent of the economic embargo, the few voices
of protest in the U.S. will likely grow.
   Among the scattered voices raised in recent days:
   _ In San Francisco, hundreds of placard-bearing protesters
marched in front of Chevron Oil headquarters Tuesday. Organized by
the Emergency Committee to Stop the U.S. War in the Middle East,
the demonstration was directed at what protesters called ``a war
for profit'' by the United States and its oil companies.
   _ In Seattle, two protesters chained themselves to the main gate
of the Naval Reserve Center on Tuesday. A dozen other protesters
dumped bags of sand and poured oil and fake blood onto the sand.
   _ In Pittsburgh, about 40 demonstrators on a college campus
created a pyramid of 55-gallon drums bearing the slogan ``war oil.''
   _ In Amherst, Mass., about 15 protesters elicited a few honks in
support from passing motorists, but also the shouted comment: ``Get
out of America.''
   _ At Westover Air Force Base, Mass., where planes being used to
supply troops in the gulf are based, two people were arrested on
charges of disturbing the peace Monday during a small demonstration.
   _ In San Francisco, 15 protesters at the Federal Building held
signs saying ``Shed No Blood for Oil'' and promised to continue
holding pickets there until the troops come home.

   Verbal scores on the SAT have dropped to their
lowest level in a decade, and a testing official says that's
because too many students are watching music videos and playing
video games instead of reading.
   Combined Scholastic Aptitude Test scores totaled 900 for the
1989-90 school year _ 476 on the math section, 424 on the verbal,
the College Board reported Monday. The highest possible score is
800 on each section, for a combined 1,600.
   Math scores were unchanged among the 1.03 million high school
students who took the test. But the verbal average was down three
points from the previous school year, marking a steady decline
since the recent peak of 431 in 1986.
   Verbal scores are now at their lowest point since 1980 and equal
to the worst levels since national averages were first compiled in
1971.

   Blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan had
beaten drugs and alcohol and fellow musicians said he was playing
better than ever when he died in a helicopter crash shortly after a
concert. He was 35.
   Four others died early Monday after Vaughan and members of
guitarist Eric Clapton's entourage took off for Chicago in dense
fog.
   Vaughan, a two-time Grammy winner known for his rocking Texas
roadhouse blues style, had shared the bill Sunday night with
Clapton and guitarist Robert Cray.
   ``His death is particularly sad, given that he'd cleaned up and
was playing the best music of his life,'' said Jeff Peterson of the

patients.
   The Sept. 1 change is welcomed by advocates for the elderly as a
relief from what many say is confusing and time-consuming paperwork
that discourages some patients from filing the forms and receiving
reimbursement.
   But it is dreaded by many physicians who envision a bureaucratic

   ``This is one of those instances where someone is trying to fix

   General Motors Corp., the world's largest
automaker, plans to install air bags on the driver's side of all
its cars built in the United States by the fall of 1995.
   Barring unforeseen design problems, the safety devices would be
in all Chevrolets, Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs, the
company said Monday. The plan doesn't apply to cars GM makes in
cooperation with Japanese companies, such as the Geo and the Nova.
   The announcement came as GM plays catch-up with its Big Three
competitors in installing a safety device that appears destined to
become as common as the safety belt.
   Chrysler Corp. currently equips almost all its North
American-made cars with air bags, first announcing the step in
1988, and Ford Motor Co. has air bags in about half of its fleet.

   The National Endowment for the Arts says
grants for four avant-garde theater performers were vetoed because
agency Chairman John E. Frohnmayer decided their work would not
``enhance public understanding and appreciation of the arts.''
   The four performers, Karen Finley and Holly Hughes of New York
and Tim Miller and John Fleck of Los Angeles, who appealed
Frohnmayer's decision, were told Friday that their appeals had been
denied.
   The NEA confirmed the action in a statement Monday.
   When Frohnmayer vetoed the four grants on June 29, he refused to
give any reasons, citing a longstanding endowment policy against
discussing grant rejections. The NEA statement Monday represented
an unusual departure from that policy in a case that has attracted
widespread publicity.

   Bela Lugosi is having a bad day. Murdering
brides and stealing their bodily fluids to rejuvenate your aging,
cranky wife is a disgusting job.
   And ``The Corpse Vanishes'' (1942), a sublevel thriller, is a
disgusting movie. Just ask the two robots and the guy sitting in
the front row.
   ``No one can hold a candle to him in this role,'' says one.
``Actually, maybe someone could douse him with a flammable liquid
and then hold a candle to him.''
   Talking back to bad movies is something most people can relate
to. But few are as funny (or as weird) as Joel Hodgson and his two
robot pals who screen catastrophes of filmmaking on ``Mystery
Science Theater 3000'' on Home Box Office's The Comedy Channel.
   This show with a baffling title and a bizarre premise is
something new in the land of comedy television. It's funny,
intelligent and off the beaten path. Actually, it's in outer space.
   As the opening song explains, Joel was a janitor whose bosses at
the Gizmonic Institute didn't like him. So they shot him into
space. This all takes place ``in the not too distant future.''
   Aboard the Satellite of Love, (also the title of an old Lou Reed
song), Hodgson is forced to watch cheesy movies such as ``The
Corpse Vanishes,'' ``The Crawling Hand'' and ``The Robot vs. the
Aztec Mummy.''
   Lonely Joel builds two robot buddies out of spare Satellite of
Love parts, and together they sit before this orbiting movie screen
and deliver a diatribe of bad puns, jokes and sight gags.
   The three appear in silhouette at the bottom of the movie
screen, on which the film plays in its entirety while they quietly
comment from the theater's front row.
   ``Mystery Science Theater 3000'' has become a cult hit for
thousands of devotees. ``MST3K'' (as viewers call it) is one of the
most popular shows on The Comedy Channel, which just renewed it for
a second 13-episode season.
   The Comedy Channel can use a hit. The 24-hour service that began
last November opened to generally terrible reviews. Archrival HA!,
launched this spring by Viacom, has been locked in a lackluster
duel with the Comedy Channel for what appears to be a small
universe of people who want to watch only comedy shows.
   But ``MST3K'' has its own nationwide fan club of 2,000-plus
members and an audience that ranges from hip college kids to
middle-aged parents. Newspapers and TV Guide have written about it.
Production companies are making offers.
   ``It's one of the biggest hits on our service,'' said Comedy
Channel spokesman Tony Fox. ``These guys are great. People write
from all over the country.''
   The unorthodox success of Mystery Science Theater is about as
offbeat as Hodgson himself, who puts the show together in a
warehouse in Eden Prairie, Minn., outside Minneapolis.
   The 30-year-old comedian stays in Minnesota because he does not
like big city life or Hollywood. He has had a speedy brush with
fame and decided it was too much.
   At age 22, right out of college, he came to Los Angeles with his
stand-up comedy routine and gadget collection (including a burning
purse and a 360-degree head cranker) and ended up doing bits on
David Letterman and ``Saturday Night Live.''
   Brandon Tartikoff, then the entertainment president of NBC,
offered Hodgson his own show. He turned it down.
   ``I just wasn't happy,'' Hodgson said.
   Two years after moving to L.A., he was back in Minneapolis. He
sold T-shirts and wrote an HBO special with comedian Jerry
Seinfeld. In the middle of this re-entry into a more normal life,
Hodgson met Jim Mallon, then a production manager at KTMA-TV in
Minneapolis.
   Together, they formed Best Brains Inc. Stand-up comedians and
local television people joined on. ``MST3K,'' which debuted on KTMA
on Thanksgiving Day, 1988, eventually was shopped to bigger
television executives.
   The Comedy Channel, in need of original programming for its
yet-to-be seen network at the time, snapped it up for its premiere
late last year.
   Hodgson, who tends to speak in dry understatement and incomplete
sentences, described the genesis of ``MST3K'' this way:
   ``It started from the idea of talk radio. Someone being really
alone. The DJ being alone and you being alone in a car. `Gilligan's
Island,' it's kind of like, too. Being isolated.''
   On ``MST3K,'' Joel's character is about as isolated as you can
get. Hurtling through space with his robot friends Crow and Tom
Servo, the trio appear as silhouettes in the lower right corner of
the television screen, looking up at a large movie screen.
   Each two-hour show contains about 450 jokes, Hodgson said. The
writing takes place around a table in the Best Brains warehouse,
where Hodgson, Mallon and the company's eight other employees watch
cheesy films, make fun of them, and jot it all down.
   In ``The Corpse Vanishes'' episode, as one bride after another
drops in a heap at the altar, Joel, Crow and Tom Servo break into
``I'm Getting Buried in The Morning.''
   When it becomes apparent the brides are not dead after all, but
merely a little low on life-sustaining fluids, an intrepid female
reporter proclaims ``You mean they may be alive in a catalytic
state?''
   ``Iowa?'' shouts Joel.

   The people who tormented Lyndon B. Johnson
with chants of ``Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?''
are old enough now to have a son or daughter in the Marines.
   And some of them are ready to take to the streets again. When
President Bush deployed the troops, he mobilized the peace movement.
   The peaceniks of Vietnam and the next few generations of
anti-war activists are forming coalitions, planning vigils, keeping
the fax machines humming.
   Human rights lawyer Ramsey Clark called together a ``Coalition
to Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East'' to demand an
American withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and to denounce the
attempt ``to take the people of this country by surprise and usurp
Arab and international peaceful and diplomatic solutions.''
   Someone even remembered the ``teach-ins'' of the 1960s at which
speakers tried to talk the Vietnam War to death. A Persian Gulf
teach-in was quickly scheduled in New York City.
   But things are different. Bush disarmed the peace advocates by
going multinational and going to the United Nations.
   And the peace movement cannot bring itself to ally itself with
Saddam Hussein, who used chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, who
gassed his own country's Kurdish minority and who invaded Kuwait, a
country that helped finance his eight-year war with Iran.
   Not even so dedicated an anti-war advocate as Dave McReynolds of
the War Resisters League _ which hasn't supported a war since its
creation in 1923 by pacifists jailed during World War I _ concedes:
``This is not Vietnam and Saddam Hussein is not Ho Chi Minh.''
   Ho was the revolutionary who led communist forces in a ``war of
liberation'' in Vietnam. The kids who taunted Lyndon Johnson also
used to cry, ``Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh'' at him.
   ``We were so stunned the first day or two at Saddam's invasion
that we didn't know what to do,'' McReynolds acknowledged. But it
didn't last.
   The league adopted a position decrying Iraq's ``indefensible''
invasion, but saying, ``The Arab nations should be allowed to
resolve the conflict.''
   American leftists, McReynolds said, were shocked when Jesse
Jackson wrote a statement for The New York Times on Aug. 12
supporting Bush's deployment.
   ``Saudi Arabia asked for our help,'' Jackson wrote. ``It seems
to me that we were obliged to respond.''
   McReynolds said Jackson's left-wing supporters are gathering
signatures on a letter taking him to task.
   ``It says what are you doing Jesse?'' he said. ``You are
supposed to speak for us. This may have looked presidential to you,
but it doesn't look rational to us and you are going to lose our
support.''
   George McGovern, the Democrats' anti-war presidential candidate
in 1972, also told the Times that he supported Bush.
   Jerome Grossman is another defector. He sold his business, the
Massachusetts Envelope Co., in 1975 to devote his energies to the
Council for a Liveable World, which he helped found in 1955. During
the Vietnam War, he said, he orchestrated the Moratorium marches of
Oct. 15, 1969, ``the largest demonstration in the history of
mankind.''
   Does he think Bush did wrong?
   Slowly Grossman ticks off his answer: ``No. 1, he set a bad
example when he invaded Panama. No. 2, he continued the Reagan
policy of not encouraging (energy) conservation. N0. 3, he did not
denounce Iraq's use of chemical weapons. But in his handling of the
current crisis, apart from the obscene continuation of his
vacation, I have no serious, major criticism.''
   But most leaders of the old peace movement are less willing to
give Bush the benefit of the doubt.
   Bruce Birchard, disarmament specialist at the American Friends
Service Committee, the Quaker group, deplores the huge American
buildup.
   ``Even if the United States does not want war _ and that's not
something we're certain of _ any unexpected move could lead to the
whole thing blowing up,'' he said.
   And Ira Shorr, program director at SANE-Freeze, said Americans'
initial reaction was ``to rally around the president'' but he said
people are becoming convinced that the administration's foremost
priority ``is a military resolution to this conflict.''
   He draws a lesson from history: ``I think our response to war
will forever be changed by Vietnam. We will never be as deeply
trustful of our government as we were then.''

<HEAD>Credit Crunch: Self-Imposed?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activities in the financial and economic world
have created many odd lines on charts and graphs during the past
three weeks, but one of the oddest is a line describing the
availability of credit.
   Even the Federal Reserve, generally thought to be the entity
that tightens or loosens the noose on the nation's money supply, is
puzzled and concerned. That being so, there is cause for general
concern.
   Credit is indeed tightening, but the Fed indicates that it isn't
the only one doing the tightening. Instead, the constricting
appears to be a joint undertaking of lenders, business people,
individuals, regulators and the banks.
   It seems that simultaneously and automatically, large segments
of these credit-user categories have come to the same conclusion,
that credit has been too easily dispensed and that it is time to
slow the flow.
   No matter where you test for opinions, in business or government
or among individuals, you will find large numbers who feel that the
economy is slowing, that bad loans are a danger, and that standards
must be raised.
   But no matter what the general opinion, there will always be
those in need of money who cannot get it, and these days that
includes not just would-be homebuyers, but small, beginning and
financially endangered businesses.
   The latest Fed survey of lending officers found a reduced
willingness on the part of banks to lend during the past three
months. Of those queried, more than one-third said they had cracked
down on lending.
   Why? Because, it seems, banks' own investment portfolios are
down, their capital positions are strained, they have observed many
other banks nearing insolvency, they fear for the immediate
economic future . . .
   These are the reasons you would expect, but there are others,
too.
   Federal regulators have been looking warily at the value of many
loans already made, and have been insisting that some loans or
assets be written down in value.
   Atop this is the sense among some bankers that they overdid
their lending in the past and lowered their standards in doing so.
Psychologically, it is the same reaction as that of the big
borrowers _ time to straighten out.
   While some businesses, especially those whose applications
contain the words ``real estate'' or ``construction'' or
``developer,'' are begging for money and not getting it, other
businesses have withdrawn from the market.
   Surveys show that businesses are very concerned about economic
conditions in general and specifically about financial practices,
their own included.
   A recent survey by the National Federation of Independent
Business, for example, found that members weren't especially hurt
by a credit crunch, one reason being that they just weren't seeking
credit.
   The consumer has cut back too, and for many of the same reasons
that dictate the actions of banks and business; that is, the
feeling that borrowing might have been overdone and that now is the
time to put matters in order.
   In summary, the tight credit market today may be partly a
reflection of private-sector attitudes, a self-imposed credit
tightening, rather than a crackdown by the Federal Reserve.
   Whatever the reason, it has engendered a rare, almost unheard
of, concern from the Fed, ``that the trend to greater restraint in
the provision of credit might continue.''

   Vladimir Lubaschevsky and his wife Natalia
traveled three days by train from Moscow to reach a new world of
``love and freedom'' in Taize.
   ``We have found here quite another life,'' the 38-year-old
engineer said shyly, clutching a dogeared Bible in one hand and
Natalia's elbow in the other. ``It is fantastic for us.''
   It is a dramatic contrast: the officially atheist Soviet Union,
where they share a bleak apartment with his mother, and this
liberal religious community nestled in the hills of Burgundy, about
230 miles southeast of Paris.
   The Lubaschevskys are among tens of thousands of newly free East
Europeans descending this year on Taize, a cross between summer
camp and ecumenical seminary.
   Taize observed its 50th birthday Sept. 1 and Cardinal Albert
Decourtray of Lyon conducted a special service.
   For many people who live here, the arrival of the East Europeans
is a greater event than the anniversary.
   ``It's very moving to know what some of them have come
through,'' said Brother John, a 38-year-old American. ``Here,
you're a Christian and it's no big deal. In East Germany, it meant
a guy had to give up his job.''
   Taize is a fraternity of 90 monks, most of them clad in sandals
and slacks, who hope to reconcile the human family and overcome
divisions among Christians through common prayer.
   Their ideas are a powerful beacon that draws more than 100,000
visitors a year to share prayer, discussion, song and silence.
   Brother Roger, 75, founded the community during World War II and
still leads it.
   He is a Swiss Protestant, a mystical man who loves Bach and tea,
and likes his Christianity simple. He will cross out whole sections
of a text by St. Augustine to make the essential message easier to
grasp.
   ``John XXIII was the pope who understood us the best,'' said
Brother Roger, who has known them all since Pius XII. ``He was a
man of great simplicity and sensitivity.''
   Both are embodied in Taize.
   Visitors sleep in tents. Three times a day, they sit on
all-weather carpet in the Church of Reconciliation to pray. In a
region known for wine, tripe sausage and escargot, they eat green
beans and pears.
   The monks keep an open ear to anxieties, hoping to turn
individual suffering into compassion.
   ``The brothers offer us a chance to take part in their prayers,
their work, which is very important to me,'' said Andrea Hegedus,
25, of Budapest, Hungary.
   ``This would have been expropriated by the communists'' in
Eastern Europe, she said, because ``coming together was a privilege
held by the party.''
   An estimated 2 million pilgrims have visited Taize in its
half-century, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa and Pope John XXIII. Pope John Paul II visited as cardinal
of Krakow in 1968 and pontiff in 1986.
   Most visitors are aged 17-25, recognizable by backpacks and
faded jeans. Some hitchhike and others arrive at the tiny railroad
station. Shuttle buses run from several Polish cities.
   Mary Tyminska, 16, arrived on a bus from Czem with 40 other
teen-agers. Some immediately tried to hitch rides to Paris, but
Mary stayed behind.
   ``Everyone is so happy here,'' she said. ``They treat you like
brothers or sisters.''
   In 1940, Roger Schuutz pedaled his bicycle from Switzerland into
unoccupied France and bought a rundown house in Taize as the home
for what he envisioned as a simple community of monks dedicated to
prayer and meditation.
   Then as now, Taize was affiliated with no church and did not
accept donations. Brother Roger refused his inheritance, following
the example of his mother, who refused too.
   The monks support themselves with a crafts shop, where they sell
articles they make. Visitors pay for meals and sleeping space in a
tent.
   In 1942, the Gestapo chased Brother Roger to Geneva after
learning he had helped Jews escape France. He returned after the
Allied invasion and conducted services for German prisoners of war
in the 13th-century village church.
   Young people started coming to Taize in the late 1950s. The
brothers built a spacious, modern church to hold them. The annual
pilgrimage grew to 100,000 in the 1970 and the brothers expanded
the church's capacity with circus tents.
   ``We didn't ever want it,'' Brother Roger said, but his monks
adapted, organizing food and lodging for their guests and composing
multilingual chants to break down language barriers.
   Some brothers now live part of the year in North and South
America, Africa and Asia to expand contact between Christians.
   ``We first started making contacts in Eastern Europe in 1962,
when we had a German brother who said we must go there to express
our humanity,'' said Brother Emile, a Canadian.
   The revolution in Eastern Europe means many who dreamed of
visiting Taize can do so. More than half the pilgrims this year are
from the region.
   ``Here, we feel a unity in faith and being together,''
Lubachevsky said. ``Here, it is approved to have more love and
freedom than we ever had before.''

   A 10-foot-high concrete barrier separates
the elite from the masses on the beach of this Black Sea resort,
illustrating the Soviet Union's failure to achieve a classless
society.
   The wall starts in the water and runs over the sand to separate
the Riviera, a public beach, from a vast playground reserved for
those with position and influence.
   No one seems to know the name of the private beach or the names
of those who use it. Little is known of the services provided, but
the sheer size of the sanctum raises eyebrows.
   On an average day, 15,000 people must crowd onto a public beach
only 750 yards long, while about 500 of the upper crust loll on an
expanse that stretches more than half a mile.
   Arkady Melkonyan, a state television correspondent, cited the
figures in a recent broadcast.
   Like Melkonyan, some citizens are indignant. Others shrug it off.
   ``The Martians live differently than we; why shouldn't they?''
Valery Skripnik, a 40-year-old gardener, said on the Riviera beach.
He spoke between chin-ups on an exercise bar.
   There is increasing criticism of reserving beaches, quality
medical care, luxury apartments, special planes and stores for
Communist Party and government officials in a country where
ordinary people live in cramped housing and stand in line for food
and other necessities.
   Some politicians, most notably Boris Yeltsin, president of the
Russian republic, have won wide popular support by attacking
privilege.
   Dozens of country homes have been converted from private
residences for the elite to public rest homes. The newspaper
Rabochaya Tribuna reported Aug. 8 that the number of aircraft
reserved for the privileged had been drastically reduced.
   Those who are more equal than others have a strong grip on
Sochi, however, and few of its facilities have gone public.
Melkonyan told viewers that, of the resort area's 151 beaches, only
22 were open to ordinary people.
   In addition to the reserved beaches, Sochi has elaborate private
resort complexes, known in Russian as sanatoriums. They do not
appear on maps, are generally visible only from the sea and are
heavily guarded.
   Down the beach from the Actors' Sanatorium and Pravda
Sanatorium, spas for actors and journalists, is the Dzerzhinsky
Sanatorium, the summer hideaway of KGB agents named for Felix
Dzerzhinsky, who founded the Soviet secret police.
   It begins at the seaside with a covered patio adorned with tall,
ornate yellow arches and white columns. An elevator takes
vacationers up a hill to a main building tucked into a thickly
wooded area.
   Exclusive beachfront facilities nearby include a small yellow
villa with white arches that was favored by Lavrenti Beria,
dictator Josef Stalin's chief of secret police.
   Farther along the Black Sea coast are the dachas, as the villas
are called, of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov and Anatoly I. Lukyanov.
   At least two resorts have been partly opened to the public after
decades of catering to the elite.
   The 180-acre Green Grove resort, once reserved for Communist
Party officials, received automotive workers from Gorky and
steelworkers from Magnitogorsk last year, director Ludmilla
Voblikova reported.
   Staffs of Communist Party schools, from janitors to instructors,
spend vacations at the complex on a wooded hill overlooking the sea.
   Voblikova has run the place since 1958, when privilege was not
questioned. She proclaimed allegiance to the new policy, but said:
``I think we should all work well, and the better we work, the
better we should live.''
   At nearby Lenin Sanitorium, the splendor formerly saved for
Communist Party officials now is available to workers from
collective farms.
   They live in a gray marble dormitory, built in 1984, that has
clean, carpeted, well-furnished rooms.
   An older building erected in the 1950s has an ``Italian
courtyard'' with colored tile, white columns and an ornate
fountain. In the main dining room are glass chandeliers, white
marble columns and parquet floors.

   A sudden, steep drop in oil prices shocked some
traders, but motorists shouldn't be surprised if they keep paying
increased prices when they fill up their cars, at least for now.
   Critics of the oil industry contend that companies tend to pass
on higher prices much more quickly than they pass on savings. They
say the lag that follows cheaper oil prices is an example of oil
company gouging.
   Oil companies bristle at the the accusation, saying the pricing
of petroleum products is left to market forces. Some industry
analysts defend the policies, saying the cost of crude oil and
gasoline on world markets has risen far faster than retail prices
in recent months.
   Crude oil fell $4 per barrel Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, while gasoline for September delivery declined 17.1 cents
to 87.5 cents per gallon.
   According to the American Automobile Association, gasoline
prices at the pump have risen an average of 20 cents per gallon
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   While pump prices weren't expected to fall immediately, Conoco
Inc. in Houston said it would lower the price of its branded
wholesale gasoline by 2 to 5 cents per gallon beginning today
because of ``softer market conditions.''
   It also said it would cut prices for unbranded wholesale
gasoline by 10.65 cents per gallon. Because retailers are required
by federal law to set pump prices, lower prices for drivers could
not be guaranteed, Conoco said.
   A Ralph Nader consumers group, Buyers Up, said it generally
takes up to several weeks for lower oil prices to translate into
lower retail gasoline prices.
   James W. Brock, a business professor at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio, said he believes the behavior of prices has shown
that oil giants are taking advantage of consumers during the
current crisis.
   ``The oil companies jumped on it to raise prices instantly,'' he
said. ``That hasn't been true when it goes down.''
   In addition to complaints from consumer groups, cries of price
gouging have been heard from members of Congress and numerous state
attorneys general.
   Oil companies repeatedly have denied charges that they are
operating unfairly, and say pump prices did not rise as much as
wholesale prices following the Iraqi invasion.
   According to a Lundberg Survey of 13,500 stations nationwide,
wholesale prices rose nearly twice as much as retail prices in the
period from Aug. 10 to Aug. 24. In addition, federal law bars
companies from setting pump prices, which is left to local service
stations.
   Also, the need for oil companies to purchase large amounts of
gasoline on so-called ``spot'' markets is less now than a month
ago, at the peak of the nation's summer driving season.
   With summer demand at its tail end, U.S. oil companies now can
rely more on their own producing and refining capabilities and will
be less affected by the price drops, some experts said.
   Gus Ensz, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
pump prices are likely to follow crude prices. ``Logic is logic,''
he said. ``What goes up comes down or what goes down comes up.''
   There is no reliable way for anybody to predict how prices will
move, or when, Ensz said.
   ``There's no fixed formula,'' he said. ``There are thousands of
people making decisions on it. There's not only companies. There
are middlemen. There are dealers themselves. Literally tens of
thousands of people make those decisions. There's not a central
headquarters where it's done.''
   Ensz acknowledged a public perception that oil companies are
quick to pass along higher costs but slow to pass along savings.
   ``There is that feeling,'' he said. ``I think that in the long
run, studies have shown that everything equalizes eventually.''

<HEAD>Merrill Settles Claims From $250 Million Trading Loss in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and its insurers have
settled a set of claims stemming from $250 million in losses from
trading mortgage-backed securities announced in April 1987,
officials said.
   Merrill also agreed to release more than $1 million in
compensation plus interest previously withheld from Howard A.
Rubin, a senior trader Merrill had blamed for a substantial portion
of the losses.
   Merrill spokeswoman Monica Prihoda said Monday that Merrill had
received $17.5 million from insurance companies that provide its
directors and officers with liability coverage to settle various
lawsuits brought by shareholders for the firm.
   Merrill had dimissed Rubin after the losses occurred and said it
had given the Securities and Exchange Commission information
relating to allegedly unauthorized trading.
   Rubin earlier this year settled SEC charges without admitting or
denying guilt that he had aided and abetted a record-keeping
violation in connection with the trades.
   ``It is worth noting that these lawsuits are being settled
without him paying anything and, indeed, with Merrill paying him,''
said George Yankwitt, an attorney for Rubin.
   ``I consider this a complete vindication of Mr. Rubin's
position, which is that he had not engaged in any unauthorized or
wrongful trading,'' he said.
   Prihoda declined to comment on details of the settlement with
Rubin as cited by Yankwitt.
   The lawsuits against the firm had mainatined that the losses
were caused by Rubin and that his superiors had failed to supervise
his activities.
   ``The settlement with Mr. Rubin was to resolve prior contractual
claims unrelated to the trading loss,'' Prihoda said.
   She also said Merrill believes all shareholder allegations about
who was to blame for the trading losses arev without merit,
``except those relating to the conduct of Howard Rubin.''
   In addition to the trading losses, various Merrill shareholders
had filed other claims on the firm's behalf against several
executives and officers. The lawsuits cited lease agreements,
various transactions and Merrill's investment in a resort
development in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   The $17.5 million payment also represented a settlement of those
claims, said David A.P. Brower, a lawyer for various Merrill
shareholders.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp., the world's largest
automaker, plans to install air bags on the driver's side of all
its cars built in the United States by the fall of 1995.
   Barring unforeseen design problems, the safety devices would be
in all Chevrolets, Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs, the
company said Monday. The plan doesn't apply to cars GM makes in
cooperation with Japanese companies, such as the Geo and the Nova.
   The announcement came as GM plays catch-up with its Big Three
competitors in installing a safety device that appears destined to
become as common as the safety belt.
   Chrysler Corp. currently equips almost all its North
American-made cars with air bags, first announcing the step in
1988, and Ford Motor Co. has air bags in about half of its fleet.
   Under federal law, all cars made in the United States after
Sept. 1, 1989, must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt
for drivers and front-seat passengers.
   GM last November said that driver's-side air bags would be
standard or optional equipment on 1.3 million 1991 models, up from
450,000 model 1990 cars.
   Air bags normally are stored in the steering wheel and inflate
rapidly during a crash. They have been mainly on the driver's side
because that seat always is occupied and because many injuries are
caused on impact with the steering wheel.
   GM President Lloyd Reuss said the company will begin offering
passenger-side air bags in the 1992 model year. Officials said GM
is conducting research on rear-seat air bags, but there are no firm
plans to offer them.
   Engineering and market considerations led GM to decide to
install driver's-side air bags by late 1995, said Donald Postma,
spokesman for GM's Technical Staffs Group.
   The only GM cars lacking driver's-side air bags would be those
in which the systems posed unforeseen design problems. ``As far as
we know there won't be any exceptions,'' Postma said.
   GM first introduced air bags as optional equipment in the 1988
model year. Since then, the automaker has made the devices standard
on some models and introduced them as options on others, which
Postma said would continue until 1995.
   Postma declined to say how much each air-bag system costs GM.
Air bags on the 1990 Oldsmobile 98 and Oldsmobile 88 are options
costing the consumer $850, he said.
   The 1.3 million 1991-model cars equipped with air bags are
expected to represent between one-third and one-half of GM's sales
for the model year.
   Before deciding to install air bags in all cars, GM wanted to
ensure suppliers could handle the production volume required,
Postma said.
   He added that the automaker ``wanted to make sure people were
ready for this amount of safety. The automotive marketplace has

   Nearly all OPEC ministers today
tentatively backed a deal that would permit increased oil
production by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and some other nations to
help offset losses arising from the Middle East crisis.
   However, officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries delayed until Wednesday a meeting to give formal approval
to the arrangement, which would temporarily lift the cartel's
supply quotas.
   Senior delegation sources said on condition of anonymity that 10
of the 11 nations participating in the informal Vienna talks
favored allowing extra pumping by some producers.
   Only Iran failed to support the arrangement. Iraq and Libya did
not attend the talks, and the meeting was postponed so messages
could be sent to them.
   ``We are trying, of course, to get everybody (in the accord) ,''
said OPEC Secretary-General Subroto.
   Libya had been expected for several days to send a delegation to
the cartel talks, which began on Sunday. Iraq had opposed holding
the gathering.
   Earlier today, the ministers tried to persuade Iran to go along
with the agreement. Iran had indicated that if the situation in the
Persian Gulf worsened, it might boost production.
   But after morning talks, the Iranian oil minister, Gholamreza
Aqazadeh, called the OPEC move a ``big mistake.''
   Aqazadeh said Western nations should first draw on oil stocks to
help meet the crisis. ``It is not the responsibility of OPEC
only,'' he said. ``For this reason, I cannot support an increase in
production.''
   The increased output would help fill a gap of about 4 million
barrels of oil a day, pulled off the market by the international
embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The prohibitions were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``Most countries have already agreed to sanction production
increases for the simple reason that ... (the countries) are going
to do it anyway,'' said a source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``If they do it outside OPEC, it may be difficult to have them
back in the mold again,'' he said Monday.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have said they will boost pumping to
help make up for the lost crude caused by the crisis. But the two
would like a nod from the others before going ahead.
   A source close to OPEC said it appeared Saudi Arabia already has
increased production to meet the extra demand. But he refused to
say by how much or give other details. It would take about a month
for the oil to enter the market.
   Saudi Arabia, which pumps about a quarter of the cartel's crude,
has an OPEC supply quota of 5.4 million barrels a day.
   The output ceiling for all 13 members is 22.5 million barrels a
day.
   With fears of oil shortages, crude prices have skyrocketed,
reaching more than $30 a barrel last week. In trading Monday, they
fell $4 a barrel.
   Iran's Aqazadeh said Monday ``it is not necessary'' now to boost
output ``but maybe in the future.''
   Iran has benefited greatly from the higher prices brought on by
the crisis.
   It contends there is enough excess oil stored in industrialized
nations to make up for any shortages. The consuming nations and
their oil companies first should draw from these inventories before
asking OPEC for help, the Iranians say.
   The arrangement permitting greater pumping was expected to
contain promises that production must fall back to current levels
once the crisis ends, according to the sources.
   It also was likely to call on consuming nations to use some of
their oil in storage to cover shortages, they said.
   It was unclear whether the final agreement would be formally
signed by the members or be more of an ``understanding'' among the
nations.
   OPEC nations are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns $148 Million Award to Liggett Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has overturned a $148.8 million
jury award to cigarette maker Liggett Group against Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., which had been found guilty of predatory
pricing.
   U.S. District Judge Frank W. Bullock in Greensboro, N.C., said
Monday the jury had come to its decision in March using legally
insufficient evidence. He denied a motion for a retrial by Liggett,
which had accused its larger rival of trying to put it out of
business.
   Brown &amp; Williamson is the nation's third largest cigarette maker
with brands including Kool and Viceroy. Liggett, the nation's
smallest cigarette maker, has the L&amp;M, Lark and Chesterfield brands.
   Bullock said Liggett had failed to show that Brown &amp; Williamson
had injured Liggett in a dispute that centered on generic
cigarettes, which cost about one third less than the average pack
price of $1.60.
   Alan Hilburg, a Liggett spokesman, said company lawyers were
studying Bullock's decision and had not decided whether to appeal.
   In its lawsuit, Liggett argued that Brown &amp; Williamson in 1984
and 1985 used volume discounts and rebates to wholesalers, which
forced Liggett to match the incentives and reduced its profits.
Liggett's market share was the industry's lowest before it entered
the discount business.
   Liggett, based in Durham, N.C., also charged that Louisville,
Ky.-based Brown &amp; Williamson had copied Liggett's plain
black-and-white packaging in an attempt to confuse consumers.
   After 115 days of testimony and nine days of deliberations, a
federal jury in Greensboro awarded Liggett $49.6 million in
damages, which automatically is tripled under the law.
   ``The judge's ruling underscores that what happened when Brown &amp;
Williamson began selling generic cigarettes is exactly what's
supposed to happen in a free-enterprise system,'' Brown &amp;
Williamson said in a statement.
   Industry figures show that Liggett Group had a 14.4 percent
market share in discount cigarettes in 1989, down from 15.2 percent
the previous year. Brown &amp; Williamson's generic share was 23.3
percent in 1989, up from 20.4 percent.

   It's a performer's dream: audiences who idolize
them, full houses, high ticket prices, potentially huge record
sales.
   And for many of the world's hottest musicians, Japan is the best
place to be. Whether it's rock, classical or jazz, Japan has become
a must stop _ often the first stop _ for traveling bands.
   Madonna kicked off her 1990 world tour, ``Blond Ambition,'' with
a seven-concert tour of Japan beginning April 13, then went back to
the United States and on to Europe.
   ``The money (in Japan) is certainly a factor,'' said Liz
Rosenberg, a publicist for Warner Bros. Records. ``Tour sponsorship
in Japan is on a much bigger scale than in other parts of the
world. Financially, it's very worthwhile.''
   Although Rosenberg refused to say how worthwhile, fans paid
about $4.5 million to attend Madonna's first three concerts in
Tokyo alone. There was no indication how much of that went to
Madonna and how much to local organizers.
   The singer's flashy show in Tokyo consisted of little more than
deafening music and a garishly lighted stage. Still, about 35,000
young fans at an outdoor stadium screamed and cheered under driving
rains through shows that lasted for two-hours.
   Other pop performers who played for Japanese audiences in the
first half of 1990 include Paul MaCartney, the Rolling Stones,
Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman, Bobby McFerrin and
David Bowie.
   Rock stars perform in huge stadiums, packing in tens of
thousands, while classical music concerts are much smaller. But
while Madonna's top ticket price was about $56, good seats for the
Chicago Symphony in Tokyo ran as high as $168 each.
   For classical music lovers, the Chicago Symphony, St. Louis
Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra and the London Symphony, with Leonard
Bernstein conducting, have all made recent tours of Japan.
   Many of the orchestral world's top batons are enthusiastic about
the Japanese music consumer.
   St. Louis Symphony Conductor Leonard Slatkin finds Japanese
audiences ``quiet, polite and appreciative.''
   ``European audiences often take the music for granted. Japanese
never do,'' said Christoph von Dohnanyi, the conductor of the
Cleveland Orchestra, which toured Japan for two weeks in May.
   Israeli conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, who has been
coming to Japan to perform for 25 years, agrees.
   ``I'm always struck by the silence with which the Japanese
audiences listen to music. It makes me feel the music is not just
entertainment, but that there is a deep respect _ almost awe _ for
the music,'' said Barenboim, musical director-designate of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in an interview.
   ``That is something I find inspiring. No other audiences are
like this.'' No other audiences buy records like the Japanese do
either. Henry Fogel, executive director of the Chicago Symphony,
says that among the three largest record markets in the world _
Europe, the United States and Japan _ the orchestra's royalties
payments are highest from Japan.
   Fees paid to the orchestra by musical presenter Kajimoto Concert
Management Co. are about twice what the Chicago Symphony gets when
it tours European capitals, but costs are higher in Japan too, says
Fogel. Sponsorship from Motorola, Inc., and Kajimoto's fee just
covered the $2.1 million cost of the orchestra's three-week Japan
tour last April. ``We'll break even,'' Fogel says.
   Japan is also home to some well-known festivals that attract the
giants of jazz. This summer's Mount Fuji Jazz Festival featured
Wynton Marsalis and Dizzy Gillespie. Another festival outside
Tokyo, ``Select Live Under the Sky,'' will feature Pat Metheny,
Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Jack Dejohnette.
   Japanese jazz fans will pay $270 a ticket to see Miles Davis at
a small Tokyo club this month.
   Jazz has been popular in Japan since it was first introduced by
U.S. occupation forces after World War II. American jazz labels
such as Blue Note have said they were able to remain in business
during slumps in jazz's popularity in the United States because of
continuing support in Japan.
   Japan is the second largest market after the United States, and
jazz music sales here total about $66 million a year.

<HEAD>Trader Enters Surprise Guilty Plea Two Weeks Before Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soybean broker has changed his plea to guilty
just two weeks before he was to have gone on trial in the
government's probe of suspected fraud at the nation's largest
futures exchanges.
   James D. Nowak, a key witness in the case, pleaded guilty Monday
to one count each of racketeering conspiracy and filing a false
federal income tax return.
   He also agreed to testify against his former colleagues from the
Chicago Board of Trade. In exchange for his plea, federal
prosecutors agreed to drop more than 200 other charges against him.
   Nowak, 48, of northwest suburban Elk Grove Village could be
sentenced to a maximum 23 years in prison and fined $350,000.
   He was among 48 people indicted last August in the undercover
investigation of the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Nowak is the second trader to plead guilty to a charge relating
to the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute,
or RICO. A scheme or criminal conspiracy must be demonstrated for
RICO convictions.
   Nowak admitted to participating in a wide-ranging scheme that
involved systematically cheating Board of Trade customers,
according to a report in today's Chicago Sun-Times.
   The report said he said he formed a ``bank'' with two other
traders and an undercover FBI agent posing as a corrupt trader, and
siphoned profits from customers to his colleagues. Nowak said he
received kickbacks in return.
   His surprise plea could encourage other indicted traders to
cooperate in the probe, the newspaper reported, citing sources it
did not identify.
   A trial that was to have included Nowak is still set to begin
Sept. 10 before U.S. District Judge George Marovich. That case
involves 12 traders.
   Another trial, against more than a dozen Japanese yen traders,
is set to begin Sept. 5.

<TEXT>
   A judge today sentenced the former head of
Guinness PLC to five years in jail for what he called ``dishonesty
on a massive scale'' in the company's hotly-contested takeover of a
Scottish distillery four years ago.
   Judge Sir Denis Henry also levied the biggest fine on record
from a British court, nearly $10 million, against another defendant
in the case.
   The judge sentenced Ernest Saunders, 54, the former chairman and
chief executive of Guinness, to five years in prison on two counts
of conspiracy and two counts of theft.
   Saunders was also sentenced to 3{ years in prison on eight
counts of false accounting. The sentences are to be served
concurrently.
   Co-defendant Gerald Ronson, 51, chairman of Heron International
PLC, was sentenced to one year in prison, fined 5 million pounds or
about $9.75 million, and was ordered to pay about $858,000 in
prosecution costs.
   The fine was the largest ever imposed by a British court. The
previous high was 525,000 pounds, then worth about $750,000,
assessed against the National Graphical Association in 1983 for
illegally picketing a newspaper plant, according to the Guinness
Book of Records. The book is owned by a subsidiary of Guinness PLC.
   Saunders, Ronson and two others were convicted Monday in what
has become known as the biggest white-collar fraud in Britain and
followed the country's explosive financial-market growth in the
1980s. Guinness' $5.2 billion buyout of Distillers Ltd. in 1986 was
the nation's biggest takeover to that point.
   ``I am quite satisfied, as the jury by their verdicts have
shown, that you were at the center of the dishonest conduct that
occurred in Guinness at the time of the Distillers takeover,'' the
judge told Saunders.
   Saunders was not fined. He says he has been impoverished by his
legal expenses, and was granted legal aid for the trial. His son
James said the family would seek further legal aid for an appeal.
   Former stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44, was sentenced to 2{ years
in prison and was ordered to pay $858,000 prosecution costs.
   Parnes collapsed during the sentencing. An ambulance was called
but he revived and remained in court.
   Parnes, Saunders and Ronson had spent their first night in jail
on Monday. Their bail was revoked following the jury verdict on
Monday at Southwark Crown Court.
   A fourth convicted man, financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, was free
on bail to give him time to prepare for and recover from an
operation on Friday for a tumor. He will be sentenced Sept. 25.
   The four men were variously convicted of conspiracy, theft and
false accounting. Saunders was acquitted on a charge of destroying
Guinness documents.
   After a 112-day trial, a jury found the four guilty of secretly
and illegally rigging the stock market to inflate the price of
Guinness PLC shares in 1986 when the company battled competitors
for control of Distillers, a Scotch whisky and gin manufacturer.
   Ronson, Parnes and Lyons are millionaires. Saunders earned
$682,000 a year but his attorney said he was now bankrupt and
penniless, his marriage had collapsed and he was living on a weekly
state handout of $59.
   While awaiting trial, Saunders complained to reporters that he
no longer had a chauffeur-driven car, could not afford taxis and
was compelled to travel on the crowded London subway.
   Prosecutor John Chadwick said at the start of the trial on Feb.
14: ``These are not men who were likely to make mistakes in their
commercial affairs. These are men who were greedy and arrogant and
who thought that they were above the law.''
   To secure control of Distillers, Guinness invited Distillers
stockholders to exchange their shares for Guinness stock. That
meant Guinness stock had to be more attractive than that of its
chief competitor in the takeover fight, Argyll Group PLC, a
supermarket operator.
   The prosecution charged that Saunders _ who had taken charge of
the ailing Guinness in 1981 and transformed it into a highly
successful business _ used the company's funds to get others to buy
Guinness stock. The large purchases of Guinness stock boosted the
market price of Guinness shares.
   More than $76.86 million worth of shares were purchased during
the takeover. The prosecution claimed Guinness paid about $48
million in unlawful indemnities against losses and in fees.
   Guinness succeeded in April 1986 in what was then Britain's
largest takeover. Saunders personally was set to make more than $5
million from the operation.
   The Department of Trade and Industry launched an investigation
in December 1986, after receiving information from U.S. authorities
who had arrested a major Guinness supporter, Ivan Boesky, for
insider dealing. In May 1987, the police were called in and the
arrests of Saunders and the others followed.
   The Daily Telegraph reported the trial was the most expensive in
British criminal history, with total legal costs estimated at $29
million.
   The hearing involved 107 days of testimony by 62 witnesses, as
well as Saunders who took the stand for two weeks in his own
defense. The judge spent five days on his summing-up before the
jury of seven men and four women returned their verdicts after 34
hours' deliberation spread over six days.

   Oil prices rebounded a bit today after falling
$4 per barrel a day earlier, as traders wondered what will happen
in Thursday's planned meeting between the U.N. secretary-general
and Iraq's foreign minister.
   ``It's just a very choppy market at this point,'' said Ed
Kevelson, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``I think it will
chop around for a couple of days. You'll probably see a lot of
emphasis put on that meeting.''
   Oil took its biggest fall in recent memory on Monday, partially
on news that the U.N. secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar,
would meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to discuss the
Middle East crisis. Traders were also betting on the possibility of
increased OPEC production.
   In early trading this morning on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the price of light, sweet crude rose 29 cents to $27.20
per barrel for October delivery. The contract fell $4 a barrel on
Monday.
   Other petroleum futures also showed slight recoveries today.
   Unleaded regular gasoline was up 1.69 cents to 89.25 cents per
gallon on September contracts after dropping 17.10 cents on Monday.
Home heating oil was up 1.50 cents to 79.60 cents per gallon on
September contracts after Monday's decline of 12.86 cents.
   But natural gas for October delivery continued its descent,
slipping from $1.502 to $1.500 per 1,000 cubic feet. It had fallen
2.3 cents on Monday.
   Kevelson said today that Thursday's meeting could send oil
prices down again if any progress appears to have been made. But if
the meeting fails to come off, or if nothing notable is
accomplished, prices could move back up.
   ``Until then, you're going to kick around in somewhat of a big
range,'' he predicted.
   Analysts said Monday's sharp decline in oil and petroleum
product prices was also based partially on the prospect of
increased OPEC production, which could offset much of the 4 million
barrels a day kept off the market through the international boycott
of Iraq and Kuwait.
   Meeting today in Vienna, nearly all OPEC ministers tentatively
backed a deal that would permit increased oil production by Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and some other nations to help offset losses
arising from the Middle East crisis.
   However, the OPEC officials they would wait until Wednesday to
hold a meeting for giving formal approval to the temporary lifting
of the cartel's supply quotas.

<HEAD>IBM Begins Nationwide Distribution of Home Computer Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM said Tuesday its 2-month-old line of home
computers will be available nationwide starting next month. The
computer company also announced new accessories for the machines.
   International Business Machines Corp. launched the Personal
System-1 line in June in three metropolitan areas: Chicago,
Dallas-Fort Worth and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   IBM said it will promote the nationwide rollout with a
television and magazine advertising campaign.
   The computers will be sold at more than 800 Sears Brand Central
stores, 32 Dayton-Hudson and 62 Dillard's department stores, as
well as IBM authorized dealers.
   Selling its products at general retailers represents a strategy
change for the world's largest computer company, which previously
only sold its machines at computer stores.
   James A. Cannavino, an IBM's vice president in charge of the
home computer line, said the two-month kickoff in the three
metropolitan areas ``exceeded our expectations.'' However, IBM did
not disclose sales figures.
   IBM said in a news release that the PS-1 machines are finding a
broader audience than expected among both advanced and first-time
computer users.
   Also, buyers have shown greater-than-expected preference for the
top-of-the-line PS-1 model, which has a list price of $1,999. Eight
out of 10 buyers so far chose that model, which includes a color
screen and a hard disc drive, a type of memory device with a large
capacity, IBM said.
   Among the accessories IBM announced for the computers is a
printer that it says offers letter-quality printing and four
typefaces for $499.
   IBM also announced a device that allows users to hook up an
electronic keyboard to the computers. IBM says the device will
allow uses to compose music much the way they work with words on
the machines.
   IBM said the PS-1 line also will be available in Canada and
Europe in September.
   This is IBM's second attempt at a home computer. Its first, the
PCjr, failed to catch on and IBM halted production of the machines
about a year and a half after their introduction in 1983.

   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 11.13 to 2,600.50 as
of noon EDT after having changed direction several times.
   But the broader market was moderately higher. Advancing issues
were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 10 to 7, with 791
stocks rising, 569 falling and 478 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a relatively light 63.16 million
shares at midday.
   After an early wave of profit-taking, the market traded in a
narrow range. Analysts said Wall Street did not have enough
momentum to carry the gains of the previous two sessions _ in which
the Dow Jones average surged more than 128 points _ into another
day.
   ``Players don't want to commit in either direction,'' said
Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Traders continued to watch the Middle East closely for any
developments that could sway the market.
   Oil prices, which plunged on Monday, regained some ground today
and that helped keep the stock market in check. The near-term price
for light, sweet crude was up 64 cents a barrel today after falling
$4 Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Northeast Utilities was the most actively traded issue on the
NYSE, rising \ to 18{.
   Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris was down &lsqb; at 44|, AT&amp;T

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

   In 1956, Harland Sanders, threatened with
financial ruin by the advent of a new superhighway, left his little
restaurant here and took his idea for Kentucky Fried Chicken on the
road.
   On Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the fast-food legend's
birth, the owner of that original restaurant is bringing a little
bit of Colonel Sanders back home.
   After almost a decade of planning, one of the colonel's first
restaurants has been turned into a museum by John R. Neal, whose
company, JRN Inc., owns 87 Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises.
   It's Neal's way of honoring the white-suited entrepreneur whose
home-cooked meals served to hungry travelers at a southeastern
Kentucky service station spawned a fast-food empire that now boasts
8,000 outlets in 58 countries.
   ``It revolutionized fast-food service,'' Neal said. ``And it all
started right there in Corbin.''
   The museum, which opens Sunday, is housed in the colonel's third
restaurant, where he developed both his finger-lickin' good secret
recipe and the pressure-cooker method that gave birth to the
fast-food era.
   ``It gives me the opportunity to share . . . the fruits of the
effort, the idea of Colonel Sanders and the Kentucky Fried Chicken
dream,'' Neal said. ``It's really a very important piece of
Americana.''
   Built in 1940, the Harland Sanders Cafe and motor court were on
old U.S. 25, then one of the main north-south routes across the
United States. But plans for Interstate 75 threatened to divert
travelers around his restaurant, and Sanders saw the end of his
life's work.
   But Sanders, who at age 65 already had guided his business
through the Depression and World War II, had enough confidence in
himself and his product to take his idea on the road.
   He loaded his car with pressure cookers and bags of spices and
built his empire, one handshake at a time.
   Sanders, who died in 1980, obtained the ``colonel'' appellation
in the 1930s from Kentucky Gov. Ruby Laffoon, who named him a
Kentucky Colonel, a honorary state title, in recognition of his
contributions to the state's cuisine.
   He started franchising his restaurants in 1952. By 1964, when he
sold the business to a group of investors that included future
Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown, he had more than 600 franchises in the
United States and Canada.
   The company, which was bought in 1986 by PepsiCo Inc. for $840
million, now has annual sales of about $5 billion.
   The renovation of the cafe _ the motel now longer stands _ has
been two years in the making, and it wasn't easy.
   Paul Cross, JRN's director of special projects, had to look to
Hollywood, Calif., to find companies to reproduce the battleship
linoleum used on the cafe's floors and the wheel-etched glass that
bore the colonel's name on the front of the building.
   But the most difficult items to locate were the period
appliances for the kitchen: a Vulcan oven and a Hobart dishwasher.
   After miles of dead ends, Cross finally found the appliances at
his old junior high school in Shelbyville, Tenn. Both pieces still
were in working order _ the oven's pilot still was lit.
   ``I feel like I have a guardian angel,'' he said.
   Cross and his team worked from pictures and postcards of the
cafe and from the accounts of townspeople. But they also had some
consulting help from the folks who knew the restaurant _ and
Sanders _ best: his family.
   ``They have really gone to every length to get it back like it
was in the beginning,'' said Mildred Sanders Ruggles, the younger
of Sanders' two daughters and his ``first field representative.''
   ``They have certainly done it,'' she said.
   Other consultants include Sanders' other daughter, Margaret
Sanders of West Palm Beach, Fla., and his widow, Claudia Sanders,
who lives in Shelbyville, Ky.
   Visitors to the museum will be able to purchase their food at a
state-of-the-art KFC kitchen adjacent to the original building, but
they'll eat in the old dining room.
   Surrounding them will be exhibits illustrating Sanders' life,
including such items as the china on which he served his famous
home-cooked meals, the certificate of incorporation for his first
restaurant, the first photograph taken of him in his white suit,
his gold-tipped walking stick, and handwritten recipe cards _
though not the one with his secret recipe.
   The exhibit also includes an exact reproduction of the model
motel room Sanders built near the ladies' restroom to lure families
to spend the night.
   ``We think that's a fairly ingenious marketing strategy,'' Cross
said.
   Mrs. Ruggles is just glad her father's old restaurant is being
taken care of the way he would have liked it.
   ``It wasn't daddy,'' she said of the restaurant before the
renovations. ``It didn't have any class. And now they're going back
and making it all the way it was. It's something that we as a
family will be proud of . . . and my daddy would say, `A job well
done.' ''

   A Japanese airline company has ordered $580
million in General Electric Co. aircraft engines for 17 airplanes,
GE announced Tuesday.
   All Nippon Airways Co. ordered GE's CF6-80C2 engines for 17 747

<HEAD>FundAmerica Announces Revised Marketing Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FundAmerica Inc., the buying club accused
of operating a pyramid scheme, announced a revised marketing plan
it hopes will satisfy regulators and allow it to resume business.
   ``We've modified the marketing plan so that the focus of the
program is in selling memberships, rather than buying them,'' said
Mitchell G. Blumberg, FundAmerica's new president and chief
executive officer.
   A company statement issued Monday did not provide details on the
marketing plan.
   The plan is intended to discourage the sale and resale of blocks
of company memberships by its sales associates, Blumberg said in
the statement.
   Irvine-based FundAmerica has about 100,000 members. Critics say
its discounts on goods and services are available free through
other channels or are subsidized by its membership fees.
   In lawsuits, they allege its true business is high-pressure
marketing of memberships.
   Under the new plan, memberships will be available only to buyers
who have identified legitimate retail prospects, Blumberg said.
   ``This is a major step in rebuilding our business,'' he said.
``New management is committed to restructuring FundAmerica and to
resuming its operations as soon as practicable, and this is where
we must begin.''
   FundAmerica filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors
on Aug. 17. The company is the subject of a $150 million class
action suit in San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines today announced it will
build its $190 million dollar aircraft maintenance center and a
world headquarters complex in Houston.
   The maintenance facility, to be built at Houston
Intercontinental Airport over the next three years, is expected to
create up to 4,000 jobs, a $150 million annual payroll and a $600
million economic impact for the city.
   The headquarters building, to house 4,000 workers, will
consolidate Continental offices around the city and result in some
employee transfers from operations elsewhere. It would be near the
airport on city-owned land.
   Houston-based Continental said it needs the maintenance complex
because of planned acquisitions of new equipment. That facility
also will consolidate numerous Continental offices on a 150-acre,
campus-style complex.
   ``Our commitment to this project will help strengthen the
economic foundation of Houston and the state of Texas, while
continuing Continental's program of growth for the decades to
come,'' said Continental Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Houston's Department of Aviation will finance the deal through
revenue bonds, which Continental will pay back. Continental will
lease the sites from the city.
   Houston won out over Shreveport, La.; Denver; and three other
Texas cities: El Paso, Corpus Christi and Beaumont.
   Continental has not yet picked a site for a separate engine
overhaul facility, to employ up to 1,200 workers. Cities competing
for that project include Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Denver, Houston
and Shreveport.

   The dollar ended higher today against most major
currencies in calm European trading as fears of a worsening Mideast
conflict receded.
   Gold failed to sustain a recovery. The precious metal rebounded
in early European trading but then fell to finish sharply lower.
   In late trading in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.5525
German marks, up from 1.5423 marks late Monday. The dollar traded
at 1.5535 in early afternoon New York trading.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.20 yen, down 1.60
yen from Monday's close of 144.80 yen. Later in London, it had
crept higher to 143.40 yen. At around midday in New York, the
dollar was quoted at 143.475 yen.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.9470 late in London, cheaper
for buyers than $1.9505 late Monday in Europe. Markets were closed
in London for a holiday. A pound fetched $1.9415 shortly after
midday in New York.
   Traders said the yen gained against the dollar as oil prices
fell.
   Brent crude for October delivery traded at about $26.30 a barrel
late Tuesday in London after trading above $29 for most of the
European day Monday.
   ``The yen-selling factor is dwindling because of the decline in
crude oil prices,'' said Masahiro Sahara, a dealer with Industrial
Bank of Japan.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Monday's levels were:
1.2815 Swiss francs, up from 1.2670; 5.2065 French francs, up from
5.1745; 1.7470 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7365; 1,149.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,142.75; and 1.1416 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1335.
   Selected midday New York dollar rates included: 1.28165 Swiss
francs; 1.14265 Canadian dollars; and 1,148.25 Italian lire.
   Gold in London traded at $383 a troy ounce late Tuesday, as
activity resumed after the holiday on Monday. Gold finished in
London last Friday at $411.75 an ounce.
   In Zurich, the late bid was $382 an ounce, down from $401 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $392.59 per ounce, down $18.36 from
Friday's closing price. The Hong Kong market also was closed Monday
for a holiday.
   Silver traded in London late Tuesday at a bid price of $4.85 a
troy ounce, down from Friday's $5.14.

   Shares in London lost some of their sharp early
gains Tuesday but ended higher on the day following strong rallies
overseas the previous day.
   The market, which was closed for a holiday Monday, reached its
highest point in the first half hour of trading.
   ``We were looking for a new attitude for the market this morning
following Tokyo,'' which rose strongly both Monday and Tuesday,
said one trader.
   But caution over events in the Middle East continued to restrict
trading activity. Although the market looked better than expected,
one trader said the trading level for the day was ``abysmal.''
   ``There is simply no supply or demand,'' said another.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 39.7 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,126.1.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 40.5 points
at 1,657.4. The Financial Times 500-share index closed at 1139.95,
up 19.49.
   Volume of 281.6 million shares was down from Friday's 347.7
million.

<HEAD>Pick GM As Target Company In Autoworker Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: DELETES erroneous reference to `hourly' in lede; CLARIFIES
status of unionized workers in 8th graf.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union today picked the
biggest of the Big Three automakers as its target company in
contract negotiations covering 450,000 active auto workers.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said General Motors Corp., which
employs 300,000 of the active workers affected by the three
national contracts, would be the target company.
   ``We were here to choose a target company at which we can
achieve a pattern agreement for 1990,'' Bieber said.
   GM said it welcomed the UAW's decision.
   ``Because it represents the largest segment of the UAW, it
seemed appropriate that the company be selected to lead contract
negotiations,'' GM said in a written statement.
   Bieber declined to talk about specifics that led to the
selection of GM and refused to talk about strategies the union may
pursue with just 18 days left in the current agreement.
   Talks at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. will be put on hold
while the UAW tries to work out a three-year agreement with GM that
then would be used as a pattern for talks at No. 2 Ford and No. 3
Chrysler.
   National contracts _ which cover about 450,000 hourly workers
and several thousand salaried workers _ expire Sept. 14, raising
pressure on negotiators to reach an agreement quickly to avoid
laying the groundwork for a possible strike.
   The contracts cover issues common to all unionized autoworkers,
such as wages and benefits. Local contracts, many of which are
being negotiated now, cover issues such as local work rules and
seniority rights.
   Chief negotiators for each company have said they want to be the
national bargaining target because it gives the automaker a chance
to negotiate an agreement more tailored to its needs.
   GM and Ford negotiated their current agreements with the UAW in
1987, when Ford was chosen as a target. Chrysler's current contract
was negotiated in 1988.
   In 1984, GM and Ford were selected as dual targets. In the last
week of bargaining, the UAW decided to focus on GM. The union hit
GM with a seven-day strike that shut down all of its assembly
plants and other factories.
   Speculation about which company would be the union's target this
year has been going on since talks began in mid-July. Observers
gave little chance of Chrysler being chosen as the target because
of its relatively weak financial condition.
   In fact, one of the biggest questions is whether Chrysler would
remain part of the bargaining pattern the UAW fought to
re-establish this year. The last time the three contracts had a
common expiration date was 11 years ago.
   Chrysler broke from the pattern in the early 1980s, when union
members accepted concessions to help the strapped automaker survive
a near-brush with bankruptcy.
   This year, Chrysler's chief negotiator, Vice President Anthony
St. John, contends that since the company's per-employee labor
costs are much higher than GM's or Ford's, it has special needs and
may not be able to afford a GM- or Ford-negotiated contract.
   St. John said simply continuing the current contract provisions
for another three years would add 16 percent to Chrysler's labor
costs _ an expense the automaker couldn't afford.
   UAW officials have brushed aside questions about negotiating
separately with the target and Chrysler, saying pattern bargaining
is here to stay.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eskimo Pie Corp. on Tuesday introduced a
fat-free dessert that company officials hope will double the firm's
share of the frozen novelty market.
   The Fat Freedom Eskimo Pie Sandwich is the first frozen novelty
using Simplesse, a fat substitute made from egg white and milk
protein.
   Simplesse was introduced earlier this year by Monsanto Co.'s
NutraSweet subsidiary. It was first introduced in Simple Pleasures,
a frozen dairy dessert rolled out earlier this year by Simplesse
Co., a division of NutraSweet.
   David V. Clark, Eskimo Pie president, said he hopes a Fat
Freedom line of products eventually will push his company's share
of the frozen novelty market from 4 percent to 8 percent. The
market segment includes frozen pies, bars and sandwiches.
   ``Fat Freedom fits in very well with our existing product, and
we're trying to offer healthier, good-tasting products to the
consumer,'' Clark said.
   The Fat Freedom Eskimo Pie Sandwich features two fat-free
chocolate wafers and a frozen dessert filling made with Simplesse.
The product initially will be tested in Illinois, Missouri,
Indiana, Iowa, Arkansas and Tennessee.
   Eskimo Pie is best known for its chocolate-covered vanilla ice
cream bar. In 1987, the company developed a sugar-free frozen dairy
novelty using NutraSweet. Last year, the company introduced an
Eskimo Pie light bar that uses sunflower oil rather than coconut or
palm oils.

   Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as wary
traders shied away from making any major commitments in a nervous
market.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 10.64 to 2,600.99 as
of 2 p.m. EDT after having changed direction several times.
   But the broader market was moderately higher. Advancing issues
were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 7 to 6, with 769
stocks rising, 661 falling and 489 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a relatively light 92.04 million
shares at midafternoon.
   After an early wave of profit-taking, the market traded in a
narrow range. Analysts said Wall Street did not have enough
momentum to carry the gains of the previous two sessions _ in which
the Dow Jones average surged more than 128 points _ into another
day.
   ``Players don't want to commit in either direction,'' said
Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Traders continued to watch the Middle East closely for any
developments that could sway the market.
   Oil prices, which plunged on Monday, regained some ground today
and that helped keep the stock market in check. The near-term price
for light, sweet crude was up 74 cents a barrel today after falling
$4 Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Wal-Mart was the most actively traded issue on the NYSE, falling
{ to 28{.
   General Motors rose } to 39~ after it was chosen as a strike
target by the United Auto Workers.
   Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris was down \ at 44{, AT&amp;T

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

   The A.L. Williams Corp., acquired by
Primerica Corp. nine months ago, will eliminate about 250 jobs, a
company spokesman said.
   The cuts are part of a restructuring that will affect all levels
of the insurance and financial services company, Williams spokesman
Mark Supic said.
   He said the majority of the job losses will come from A.L.
Williams Corp. and Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Co.,
which together employ about 1,700 people.
   The restructuring by Primerica already has affected some top
Williams officials, including president William Keane, who left the
company earlier this month after his position was eliminated.
   ``These actions are the result of a months-long post-merger
review of all Primerica subsidiaries and are expected to improve
operating efficiencies,'' Supic said.
   Primerica completed its acquisition of Williams last November,
when it paid $470 million for the company's remaining publicly held
stock. Primerica spokeswoman Mary McDermott said the job cuts at
Williams are part of an effort to restructure all of the
corporation's holdings. The move began in 1988, when Primerica was
acquired by Commercial Credit Corp., she said.
   ``All of our companies have gone through, and are still going
through, some restructuring and downsizing,'' Ms. McDermott said.

<HEAD>Fiat Temporarily Lays Off 35,000 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat SPA announced Tuesday it would
temporarily lay off 35,000 of its 116,000 factory workers.
   The layoffs were to address sharper-than-expected declines in
European auto sales during the second quarter, said a spokesman for
Fiat, Italy's largest industrial group.
   ``The second quarter has been far below expectations,'' the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the layoff plan, which will involve work suspensions
ranging from one to three weeks over the next three months, will
help reduce excess production capacity that has built up due to the
poor growth of the European auto market.
   The suspensions will begin the week of September 24 and continue
through December.
   Fiat, under the layoff plan, has also frozen hiring of unskilled
blue-collar workers and stopped authorizing overtime.
   The spokesman said Fiat had planned to sell more than 2.4
million units in 1990 based on an average growth rate of 2.2
percent of the European car market during the first quarter.
   Fiat posted record sales in that quarter, helped by an
above-average 5.7 percent growth rate of the Italian car market, he
said.
   But after second-quarter sales figures showed the European
market was actually shrinking by 3.6 percent, Fiat had to revise
its sales projection to 2.24 million units in 1990, he said.
   Fiat is also expected to be hurt by the crisis in the Gulf and
consequent higher oil prices.
   ``We will reduce our capacity by some 75,000 units by the end of
the year,'' the spokesman said.
   Under Italian law, companies can suspend workers with pay under
adverse market conditions, including an excess of capacity. The
workers receive 85 percent of their full salary through a pool of
funds to which the company contributes.
   Fiat's share of the Italian market fell to 54.3 percent in the
first semester of 1990 from 58 percent in the first half of 1989.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
light trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said traders were taking a wait-and-see attitude after
Monday's sharp decline of prices in the grain market. The selloff
was tied to the drop in crude oil and precious metals prices.
   ``There was very little action in the stocks, oil and precious
metals, so the grains traded both sides of market,'' said Jerry
Zusel, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   Grain and soybean prices were pushed higher last week on fears
of war in the Middle East and fears of inflation in the United
States, he said.
   ``People are watching events in the Middle East,'' Zusel said.
``If we get a new spate of news on a negative note, then grain
prices will rise again. Otherwise grains will be on the defensive.''
   The latest state crop reports indicate the condition of corn and
soybeans has improved because of hot, dry weather conditions.
Prices are also being pressured by a lack of export demand.
   At the close, wheat was a \ cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.79} a bushel; corn was a \
cent lower to 2 cents higher with September at $2.54 a bushel; oats
were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with September at $1.08{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1\ cents higher with September at
$6.19{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Carrier President Steps Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William A. Wilson will step aside Saturday
as head of Carrier Corp. amid slumping sales at the world's largest
maker of air conditioning and heating equipment.
   Wilson, 56, will leave his post as president and chief executive
officer at Carrier to become senior vice president for
commercial-industrial operations at United Technologies Corp. until
he retires March 1. Hartford, Conn.-based UTC is Carrier's parent
company.
   UTC spokesman Dan Harrison said Wilson's decision to leave
Carrier was voluntary. He will be replaced with Karl J. Krapek,
president and chief operating officer of UTC subsidiary Otis
Elevator.
   Wilson became Carrier's president in 1984 and chief executive
officer in 1986. His tenure at Carrier was marked by large-scale
layoffs, a revamping of the company's product line and a shift in
the company's global headquarters from Syracuse to Hartford, Conn.
   Carrier employed more than 7,000 people at its Syracuse
operations in the early 1980s. In mid-July it announced it was
closing is 309-employee CC-1 plant by the end of 1991, bringing its
workforce to below 3,800.
   The latest Carrier shuffle took some industry experts by
surprise.
   ``It's kind of a shock,'' said Gordon Duffy, publishing director
of Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration News, a trade
magazine.
   ``Wilson was really the driving force at Carrier, and the whole
thing is kind of surprising to me,'' he said.
   Harrison said Carrier's North American sales declined
substantially in the second quarter, due to slow housing starts and
cool weather, although international sales improved. No quarterly
figures were available, but Duffy said sales are down industrywide.
   Carrier had 1989 sales of $4 billion, up from $3.5 billion the
year before. In a move to increase revenues, Carrier on Monday
announced a 5 percent to 9 percent price increase on part of its
commercial line, effective on equipment shipped after Nov. 14.

   Prices closed modestly higher in a cautious
session on Wall Street today as traders kept a wary eye on Middle
East developments and the price of oil.
   After an early wave of profit-taking, the market traded in a
narrow range, with the Dow Jones industrial average changing
direction several times.
   Analysts said the market did not have enough momentum to carry
the gains of the previous two sessions _ in which the Dow Jones
average surged more than 128 points _ into another day.
   ``Players don't want to commit in either direction,'' said
Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Traders continued to watch the Middle East closely for any
developments that could sway the market. Late in the Wall Street
day, the Iraqi News Agency reported that President Saddam Hussein
declared all women and children foreigners in his country would be
free to leave the country on Wednesday.
   Oil prices, which plunged on Monday, regained some ground today,
keeping the stock market in check. The near-term price for light,
sweet crude rose 97 cents to $27.88 a barrel today after falling $4
Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump has pledged his 27.2 percent
stake in Alexander's Inc. as collateral for his $65 million
financial rescue from casino and bank debt, documents disclosed
Tuesday.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Trump
revealed that as part of the restructuring of some $2 billion in
debt last week, he pledged more than 1.35 million shares in the New
York department store chain as security.
   The three New York banks to which the Alexander's stock was
pledged were not identified in the documents.
   The slumping New York real estate market and disappointing
results from his Atlantic City, N.J., casinos put Trump in a cash
squeeze earlier this year, endangering his ability to pay his debts
on time.
   On June 15, Trump failed to make a $43 million payment on bonds
issued to build the Trump's Castle hotel and casino in Atlantic
City. He also was overdue on a $30 million loan payment to a group
led by Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Co.
   But the New Jersey Casino Control Commission approved the bank
bailout to help restructure about $2 billion of Trump's $3.2
billion casino and bank debt.

<HEAD>Stiff Sentences in Britain's Biggest Financial Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos LON5-6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge came down hard Tuesday on convicts in
Britain's biggest white-collar fraud, sentencing the former head of
brewing giant Guinness PLC to five years imprisonment and a
co-defendant to a record fine.
   Another defendant collapsed in court as judge Sir Denis Henry
was about to pronounce his sentence in the Guinness PLC scandal
stemming from the company's multibillion dollar takeover of a
Scottish distiller four years ago.
   Four prominent professionals were convicted Monday on 19 counts
of fraud and other charges in the scandal, which revealed the dark
side of the takeover craze that swept Britain in the late 1980s. It
symbolized an era of greed akin to the insider trading scandal that
rocked Wall Street at the same time.
   Henry said he ordered the stiff punishment for the lead
defendant, former Guinness chairman and chief executive officer
Ernest Saunders, because of what the judge called his ``dishonesty
on a massive scale.''
   The judge levied an unprecedented $9.75 million fine against
millionaire- businessman codefendant Gerald Ronson, as well as a
one year prison term for what the judge described as ``an attack on
the integrity of the market.''
   Former top stockbroker Anthony Parnes, sentenced to 2 1@2 years'
imprisonment, passed out during the proceedings, causing a
90-minute delay while a doctor treated him.
   Ronson and Parnes also were ordered to pay more than $850,000
each for the costs of the prosecution.
   Millionaire financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, convicted with the
others Monday, will be sentenced on Sept. 25. The judge freed him
on bail so he can undergo surgery.
   A jury found the four had secretly and illegally rigged the
stock market to inflate the price of Guinness shares in 1986. That
helped the company successfully battle competitors for control of
Distillers Ltd., a whisky and gin manufacturer.
   The judge said the Guinness case had shown that ``when men are
hell-bent on victory, greed is in the saddle and the normal
commercial proprieties and respect for the law are cast aside in
the rush.''
   The mammoth trial at Southwark Crown Court lasted more than 100
days.
   Henry especially criticized Saunders, 54, for what he called the
former executive's dishonesty in allowing the payment of illegal
multimillion dollar fees to prop up Guinness' stock price.
   That helped Guinness win its $5.26 billion takeover battle
against supermarket operators Argyll for Distillers. At the time,
it was Britain's largest takeover.
   ``I am quite satisfied, as the jury by their verdicts have
shown, that you were at the center of the dishonest conduct that
occurred in Guinness at the time of the Distillers takeover,'' the
judge told Saunders.
   Saunders' son James, 24, called the sentence ``appalling'' and
``totally unwarranted'' and said his father would appeal.
   ``My father has been made a scapegoat. He has lost everything in
his entire life,'' he said. Saunders has lost his country home and
his job and split with his wife Carole since the scandal broke.
   Saunders will stand trial again later this year with three other
Britons accused of misconduct during the Distillers takeover.
British authorities are trying to have American lawyer Thomas Ward
extradited from the United States to be tried with them.
   The fine against Ronson, 51, breaks the record for the highest
court fine, previously held by the National Graphical Association
union. It was fined $750,000 in 1983 for illegally picketing a
newspaper plant.
   Ronson's lawyer Lord Mishcon said he was ``shocked'' by his
client's sentence.
   ``Obviously Mr. Ronson and the family ... find it difficult to
accept because they regard Mr. Ronson as Mr. Ronson regards
himself, as having acted honorably and honestly,'' he said.

<HEAD>Labor Leaders Hope '90s is the Decade for Workers' Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers wracked by the widening gap
between the well-paid and the poorly paid are likely to force labor
issues _ particularly health care _ to the forefront in the 1990s,
analysts and union leaders predict.
   ``That middle class that's been stepped on and pushed down to a
lower class is starting to resent it and fight back,'' Richard
Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers, said in advance of
this first Labor Day of the 1990s.
   ``People will no longer tolerate the fact that they work 40
hours or more a week and don't have health care, that their
children don't have health care,'' Trumka said.
   Jim Green, a labor historian at the University of Massachusetts,
said that the coming years would bring ``a lot of anti-corporate
sentiment from people who are having a hard time making it.
   ``I think people are scared and angry about the uncertainty of
their lives, about what's happened to the safety net. If we're
working harder, why aren't we getting ahead?
   ``The '80s was a decade of yuppies and BMWs . . . an
ostentatious, wasteful display of wealth,'' Green said. ``In the
'90s, I think we're going to see a lot of social unrest as people
start to realize that there's been a real decline in their quality
of life.''
   Real earnings _ or wages after adjustment for inflation _ ground
to a standstill for many Americans in the 1980s, according to
figures provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Using 1977 as a base, the median weekly salary in 1980 was $257,
but that translated to $190 after adjustment for inflation, the
bureau said.
   This year's figures show that the median weekly salary for the
April-June period was $413, but after inflation, it was just $195,
giving workers only a minuscule improvement in their purchasing
power over 1980, the BLS said.
   ``That American myth about being able to pull yourself up by
your bootstraps _ it doesn't exist anymore,'' said Barbara Otto of
9to5, National Association of Working Women, an advocacy group for
secretarial and clerical workers.
   Another study released this weekend by the Economic Policy
Institute, a labor-backed group, found that from 1979 to 1988, the
incomes of the wealthiest 5 percent of American families grew 17.6
percent _ five times faster than incomes for the bottom 80 percent.
   That study also said real wages for the average American worker
have declined by almost 10 percent over the past decade and that an
additional 5.8 million people were living in poverty, compared with
1979.
   Barry Bluestone, an economist with the University of
Massachusetts, contends that the recent shift to a service sector
economy has produced thousands of ``McJobs'' at fast-food chains
rather than good-paying jobs. He says workers' standing will worsen
if the nation slips into recession soon, as many economists fear.
   ``The working Joe or Jane did not have much to celebrate during
the 1980s ... It seems clear to most economists that the early
1990s will treat the average worker even worse than the '80s,''
Bluestone said. ``I see a continuation of the trends that we saw in
the 1980s, the polarization between the well paid and poorly paid.''
   Michael Dukakis tried to make a declining middle class a main
theme of his 1988 presidential bid. But voters overwhelmingly
rejected the Democrat's argument, instead favoring Republican
claims that the longest peacetime expansion in the nation's history
had created millions of new jobs in the 1980s and given Americans
unprecedented prosperity.
   Union leaders are hoping that workers' growing dissatisfaction
will help revive the labor movement, which suffered a series of
blows in recent years. Membership has dropped: the 17 million
Americans who belonged to unions last year made up just 16.4
percent of the work force, down from the 18 percent they accounted
for in 1985.
   In addition, labor's ultimate weapon _ the strike _ has lost a
bit of its firepower because more and more companies feel
emboldened to hire permanent replacement workers. Union leaders pin
the start of that trend on former President Reagan's firing of air
traffic controllers in 1981.
   One of labor's immediate priorities is to get Congress to outlaw
the practice, used most recently in the Greyhound drivers' strike
and against machinists and pilots at Eastern Air Lines.
   Trumka, noting that the American labor movement originally grew
out of social unrest, said unions are counting on a similar
movement in the '90s.
   ``In the '80s, working people's issues were like holding your
hand out in the sunlight. It never got burned,'' said the
mineworkers' president. ``In the '90s, it's going to be like
holding a magnifying glass out in that sunlight and focusing on one
spot on that hand.''

   The dollar turned mixed in domestic trading
Tuesday after finishing mostly higher overseas, but much of the
day's activity centered on other currencies.
   Gold prices pulled back again after plunging more than $25 an
ounce in the previous session. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold settled at $385.00 a troy ounce, down $3.30 from Monday.
Later, Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold at $384.50
an ounce, down $4.50.
   Trading was relatively quiet as fears of a worsening Middle East
conflict receded.
   ``Nothing has happened (in the Persian Gulf) so far, so the
market is beginning to think it is less of a concern,'' said Linda
McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
``The market is quite comfortable not to worry.''
   Much of the day's activity centered on the Japanese yen, which
declined on profit-taking after a sharp runup in recent days.
   Many other dealers were focused on the Swiss franc, which also
lost ground. ``Comments from the Swiss National Bank last week that
the franc has appreciated too fast and too far continued to weigh
on the Swiss franc,'' said Bill Jansen, a trader with Discount Corp.
   He summed up the session by saying it was ``a day concentrated
on cross trading.''
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.20 yen, down 1.60 yen
from Monday's close of 144.80 yen. Later in London, it had crept
higher to 143.40 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 143.75 yen,
down from 144.20 yen on Monday.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.9470 late in London, cheaper
for buyers than $1.9505 late Monday in Europe. Markets were closed
Monday in London for a holiday. In New York it cost $1.9429 to buy
one pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.9434.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5560 German marks, up from 1.5505; 1.2860 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2735; 5.2175 French francs, up from 5.2010;
1,149.25 Italian lire, down from 1,149.50; and 1.1416 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1432.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5525 German marks, up from 1.5423; 1.2815 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2670; 5.2065 French francs, up from 5.1745;
1.7470 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7365; 1,149.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,142.75; and 1.1416 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1335.
   Gold in London traded at $383 a troy ounce late Tuesday as
activity resumed after the Monday holiday. Gold finished in London
last Friday at $411.75 an ounce. In Zurich the late bid was $382 an
ounce, down from $401 late Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $392.59 per ounce, down $18.36 from
Friday's close. The Hong Kong market also was closed Monday for a
holiday.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.840 a troy ounce, down from
$4.848 on Monday. In London the metal fetched a bid $4.85 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.14.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Rebound Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures on Tuesday regained some of the huge losses that
occurred in the previous day's trading, but analysts said trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange was confused due to a lack of
news in the Persian Gulf.
   On other markets, precious metal futures were off; grain and
soybeans were mixed; and livestock and pork futures fell.
   ``Today's market was a function of yesterday's market,'' said
Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D. &amp; F. Man International Futures
Inc. ``We bounced up, but there was not any particular news to
account for the rally.''
   Crude oil futures prices had their sharpest one-day decline in
history on Monday, due to expectations the Middle East crisis would
be resolved diplomatically.
   ``We ended higher, yet a lot of the news is bearish,'' said an
analyst who asked not to be named. ``I thought we would see more
what we saw yesterday.''
   While the price of spot crude was higher, prices for later
contracts were lower. Traders said the losses in the later months
were a correction of the distortion that developed Monday as
trading limits prevented those contracts from falling as steeply as
the prices for current delivery.
   Light sweet settled 66 cents lower to 99 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in October at $27.88 a barrel; heating oil
was 1.79 cents to 4.43 cents lower with September at 79.52 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was 6 cents lower to .97 cent higher with
September at 88.53 cents a gallon.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, precious metals continued
the selloff that began Monday.
   ``Precious metals remain totally dependent on what goes on in
Iraq and on the crude oil market,'' said William O'Neill, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York. ``No other
factors are having an impact on prices.''
   O'Neill said producer selling is the primary reason for the
overall weakness of precious metals. He said the price levels
reached by gold and silver in recent weeks have been the best in a
long time.
   ``The producers _ Australia, South Africa and the Soviet Union _
took advantage of that and dried up speculative interest,'' O'Neill
said.
   Gold was $3.30 to $4.10 lower with August at $385 a troy ounce;
silver was .80 cent to 3 cents lower with August at $4.840 a troy
ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in light trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said traders were taking a wait-and-see attitude after
Monday's sharp decline of prices in the grain market. The selloff
was tied to the drop in crude oil and precious metals prices.
   ``There was very little action in the stocks, oil and precious
metals, so the grains traded both sides of market,'' said Jerry
Zusel, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   Grain and soybean prices were pushed higher last week on fears
of war in the Middle East and fears of inflation in the United
States, he said.
   ``People are watching events in the Middle East,'' Zusel said.
``If we get a new spate of news on a negative note, then grain
prices will rise again. Otherwise grains will be on the defensive.''
   The latest state crop reports indicate the condition of corn and
soybeans has improved because of hot, dry weather conditions.
Prices are also being pressured by a lack of export demand.
   Wheat was 1} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September at
$2.79} a bushel; corn was 1\ cent lower to 1} cents higher with
September at $2.53} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower
with September at $1.08{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to
1\ cents higher with September at $6.19} a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as profit-taking set in after Monday's price climb.
   Sluggish retail demand for beef weighed on livestock futures as

   Stock prices rose modestly Tuesday as Wall
Street, its eye trained on the Middle East and the oil markets,
decided to play it safe following two days of sharp gains.
   Analysts said traders were unwilling to make large commitments,
and so prices fluctuated in a narrow range throughout the day.
   The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 3.22 to 2,614.85 after
reversing course several times. The slight gain followed a 78.71
point surge in the average on Monday, and a 49.50 point advance
Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to
4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 837 up, 664 down and 492 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a relatively light
127.65 million shares, down from 160.15 million in the previous
session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled nearly 157.70 million shares.
   The market shook off an early wave of profit-taking and then
became locked in a narrow trading range for the rest of the day.
   Analysts said the fluctuations and the relative lack of volume
showed the market was very cautious, and that traders were
reluctant to make major commitments while the situation in the
Middle East remains uncertain.
   Oil prices, which helped spark Monday's big rally, kept the
market in check Tuesday.
   The near-term price for light, sweet crude rose 97 cents to
$27.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. A $4 plunge in
oil prices on Monday had helped boost stock prices.
   Jack Barbanel, a stock market analyst with First Global
Management Inc., said Tuesday's trading ``tells me we have to be
very suspect'' about Monday's big rally.
   ``They really pushed it to the limit, but there's no
follow-though today,'' he said.
   Wall Street continued to watch the Middle East closely for any
developments that could sway trading. Late in the stock market's
day, the Iraqi News Agency reported that President Saddam Hussein
declared all women and children foreigners in his country would be
free to leave the country on Wednesday.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE was General Motors,
up 1&lsqb; to 40\ after the company was chosen, as expected, as a strike
target by the United Auto Workers.
   Among other blue chip issues, AT&amp;T fell 1 to 32&lsqb; and Philip
Morris picked up \ to close at 45.
   Exxon rose { to 50&lsqb;, but other oil stocks were bigger winners as
traders watched crude prices rebound. Chevron rose 1&lsqb; to 75|, Amoco
gained 1&rsqb; to 55}, Atlantic Richfield advanced 1~ to 134&lsqb;, and
Texaco rose 1} to 62}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $3.818 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up 0.08 to 176.26.
   But other broad market indicators were mixed. Standard &amp; Poor's
industrial index rose 0.88 to 381.58, while S&amp;P's 500-stock
composite index fell 0.10 to 321.34.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.59 to 382.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 321.78, up 1.05.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines promised to comply with
a federal judge's order to make changes in schedules at Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport.
   American Airlines went to court Monday to press for the changes,
contending United's proposed schedule was misleading. U.S. District
Judge John McBride ordered the change the same day.
   The Fort Worth-based carrier said United schedules starting Oct.
1 reflect not-yet approved deviations from federal guidelines on
takeoffs and landings at O'Hare.
   The rules are high-density slot rules, intended to regulate
traffic at four of the nation's busiest airports by designating
times for takeoffs and landings.
   ``United will comply with the court's order and we expect the
FAA on Friday to approve formally our schedule, which we carefully
designed to reduce congestion and delay at O'Hare,'' United said in
a statement.
   McBride has scheduled a hearing for Sept. 4 to decide whether to
issue a preliminary injunction that would bar United from operating
under the new flight schedules, American spokesman Ed Stewart said.
   Earlier this year, United resumed its position as the nation's
largest carrier, replacing American.

   The chairman of Ameritrust Corp., which has
lost more than $33 million in the first half of this year, has
resigned, the bank holding company said Tuesday.
   Jerry V. Jarrett will be replaced as chairman on an interim
basis by Craig R. Smith, 65, an Ameritrust director since 1980 who
is a former chairman of Warner &amp; Swasey Co.
   James D. Rode, 42, president of both the holding company and the
bank, was named chief operating officer of the holding company and
chairman and chief executive officer of its principal banking
subsidiary.
   Jarrett also resigned as a director of both the corporation and
the bank, which lost $51.6 million in the first three months of
this year after a regulatory examination led to a special $120
million addition to its reserve against possible loan losses.
   The corporation lost $33.2 million in the first half of the year
and laid off 780 people Aug. 16.
   Analysts have criticized the company for not being careful
enough in making risky loans.
   Ameritrust and its subsidiary banks have more than 200 banking
offices in Ohio and Indiana.

   Nabisco Brands Inc. announced Tuesday it
will begin marketing a fat-free cracker next month.
   The Fat Free Premium crackers will be on store shelves by Sept.
10 with a price tag of $1.79 for a 15-ounce package, said Ann
Smith, spokeswoman for the company, which is a division of RJR
Nabisco Inc.
   The label on the cracker says it has zero grams of fat per half
cup, or five crackers, compared to the original Premium cracker,
which has two grams of fat for the same quantity.
   Smith said the previous fat level ``is a fairly high amount
especially since people rarely eat crackers alone.''
   The company began developing the new crackers about two years
ago as many consumers began to lower fat and cholesterol intake and
as other companies introduced fat-free cakes, yogurts and other
products, Smith said.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that
the government's Resolution Trust Corp. can override Arkansas bank
branching laws in approving the sale of a failed savings and loan.
   The 2-1 ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a lower court ruling that said the sale of Federal
Independence Savings to Worthen Bank and Trust Co. would violate
Arkansas state law.
   At issue is an RTC regulation that permits banks making
emergency acquisitions of insolvent thrifts such as Independence to
operate the branches of the thrift as bank branches. Independence
has 20 branches in 15 counties.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen M. Reasoner of Little Rock, Ark.,
had ruled that the RTC's proposed sale to Worthen would violate
Arkansas' bank branching law, which limits banks to branches within
their home counties.
   The RTC argued that it was granted broad rule-making authority
by Congress in its mission to maximize the returns and minimize the
losses in resolving failed thrifts.
   ``We consider today's ruling to be a significant victory for the
taxpayers of the United States,'' Worthen President and Chairman
Curt Bradbury said in a statement.
   He said the bank believes acquiring Independence will be a
``beneficial stabilizing force for the financial-services segment
of our economy.''
   RTC attorney Dorothy Nichols said the case had national
implications because 26 states have similar laws.
   The RTC's authority has been challenged in New Mexico and
Colorado, RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos said. He said a district
court judge in New Mexico sided with the RTC earlier this year.
   In Colorado, a hearing on the case is scheduled for Sept. 5,
Katsanos said. The District Court has issued a restraining order to
keep the RTC from going ahead with any transaction that would
involve overriding Colorado state law.
   In the Independence case, Arkansas State Bank Commissioner Bill
J. Ford and the Arkansas Independent Bankers Association had filed
suit June 28 to block the proposed sale to Worthen.
   In arguments before the appellate court, the RTC's Nichols
argued that most of Independence's branch offices would be shut
down by the RTC if the institution was sold piecemeal.
   ``The most valuable assets of S&amp;Ls in dire straits aren't their
loan portfolios,'' she said. ``The most valuable asset of a failed
thrift is its branches.''
   Ford argued that the state's 1988 branching law, which would
permit statewide branches gradually over 10 years, was necessary to
ensure fair competition.
   Tuesday's opinion was written by Circuit Judge John R. Gibson
for Circuit Judge Frank J. Magill.
   Senior Circuit Judge Gerald W. Heaney dissented, agreeing with
Arkansas officials that the RTC's regulation referred only to the
ability of the savings associations to operate branches and not to
the ability of a bank to retain and operate branches.

   Source Perrier will replace the label on its
sparkling water in Europe because it doesn't meet European
Community criteria for naturally carbonated water, officials said.
   The label that describes Perrier as ``Naturally Carbonated''
will be replaced in Europe Nov. 1 with one reading ``Natural
Mineral Water Fortified With Gas From The Spring.''
   This marks the third label change in six months for Perrier.
Earlier this year, traces of benzene were discovered in some
bottles, leading to a worldwide recall of 160 million bottles.
Labels for bottles produced after the recall carried the words
``New Production'' to distinguish them from the earlier vintage.
   A dirty filter on a gas line caused the benzene contamination.
   Then in April, Source Perrier and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration agreed that the word ``naturally'' would be dropped
from the label reading ``Perrier Naturally Sparkling Mineral
Water.''
   British Deputy Food Minister David Maclean praised the change in
Europe as a victory for European consumers.
   ``Similar changes in labeling had already been agreed for the
U.S. market and it is right that U.K. consumers should also have
the same treatment,'' Maclean said.
   The U.S. changes will occur in late October, said Jane Lazgin,
spokeswoman for Perrier Group of America Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.,
the company's U.S. distributor.
   In Europe, Perrier will exhaust its stock of old labels before
switching to the new ones this fall.
   The latest labeling change developed after the British
government filed a complaint with the EC's executive commission
alleging Perrier's labeling violated EC regulations and misled
consumers.
   The dispute arose from the way Perrier produces 1 billion
bottles of water a year, said British officials and Peter Thomas,
Perrier's international marketing director.
   Carbon dioxide gas occurs naturally at the Perrier spring at
Vergeze in southern France. Perrier normally separates the water
from the gas underground and pipes them separately to the bottling
plant. They are remixed during the bottling process.
   Thomas said that Perrier adds additional gas to the water by
drilling deeper into the spring and tapping pockets of natural
carbon dioxide.
   That gas forms perhaps a little under half of the carbon dioxide
bubbles in a bottle of Perrier, Thomas estimated.
   ``It is a naturally sparkling mineral water,'' Thomas said. ``We
also reinforce that with gas from deeper in the spring.''
   But the EC's Natural Mineral Waters Directive states that the
term ``naturally carbonated'' applies only to waters containing the
same gas they had in the spring. If other gas from the spring is
added, the water comes under the ``fortified'' heading.
   Perrier voluntarily agreed to change the label after agreeing
with the EC commission and the French government that the new
billing would better describe the product, Thomas said.
   The Nov. 1 change affects the 12-nation European Community,
about 60 percent of Perrier's market, Thomas said, adding that
other nations may request similar treatment.
   Perrier's sales and prestige fell sharply after the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration discovered benzene in some samples in
February.
   The U.S. ordered a recall and Perrier voluntarily extended it
around the world a week later when benzene-laden bottles turned up
in other countries.
   The company, which stakes its reputation on the purity of its
bottled water, quickly regained the lost sales this spring. Sales
are at 75 percent of their level last winter, Thomas said, while in
France, Perrier sold more bottles in July this year than in July
1989.

   Victims of a debilitating spinal nerve
disease sued Eastman Kodak Co. and four other companies Tuesday
over a dye used for diagnostic purposes, the attorney for the class
action said.
   The 25 plaintiffs, who live in 18 states, allege they were not
adequately informed of the dangers of Pantopaque, a dye injected
into the spinal membrane for diagnostic purposes.
   Eastman Kodak is the principal manufacturer of iophendylate, the
sole active ingredient in Pantopaque.
   Also named in the lawsuit are Alcon Pharmaceutical Laboratories
Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas; Alcon Puerto Rico Inc. in Humacao,
Puerto Rico; Lafayette Pharmaceutical Inc. of Fort Worth; and
Lafayette Pharmacal Inc., which operated in Indianapolis but has
since been acquired by Alcon.
   The four firms assisted Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak in
manufacturing, marketing and distributing the dye, which has been
on the market since the 1950s, according to the lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Newark.
   The lawsuit said the plaintiffs had the substance injected into
their spine at least once to diagnose back or spinal injuries. They
blame the dye for causing arachnoiditis, an inflammation of the
arachnoid membrane that envelopes the brain and spinal cord.
   Victims of arachnoiditis suffer from ailments ranging from
chronic pain to quadriplegia to death, said Gary Meyers, the
plaintiffs' attorney.
   The plaintiffs live in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida,
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin.
   The lawsuit was filed in New Jersey because Eastman Kodak is
incorporated there.

<HEAD>Keating Hands Over Financial Disclosure to Regulators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona businessman Charles Keating Jr., a
key figure in the savings and loan debacle, gave financial
disclosure statements to the government Tuesday, a day past a
federal judge's deadline.
   ``We were preparing a contempt case against him when the
paperwork was filed,'' said Thomas P. Mason Jr., a spokesman for
the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Keating says he is broke. The OTS had ordered Keating to prove
it and partially froze his assets in connection with its efforts to
recover $41 million from Keating and five associates.
   That effort stems from the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, which Keating controlled and has been
accused of looting. Regulators have estimated the collapse may cost
taxpayers $2 billion, contending with Miami's CenTrust Bank as the
nation's costliest failure.
   The OTS got a court order enforcing its administrative action
from U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles last
week. The deadline for disclosure was Monday.
   Keating also has been ordered not to send any money out of the
country and to give 48 hours notice before spending more than
$5,000.
   Keating earned huge salaries, lived lavishly, and contributed
heavily to politicians while he headed American Continental Corp.,
a Phoenix development company that owned Lincoln.
   He contends he never broke any laws and that government
officials are making him a scapegoat to conceal their own failure
to prevent the S&amp;L disaster.
   However, Keating suffered a significant defeat last week in
Washington, where he was trying to make that case. U.S. District
Court Judge Stanley Sporkin dismissed his lawsuit to recover
control of Lincoln, saying actions by Keating and his cohorts
``amounted to a looting of Lincoln.''
   After the ruling, he resigned as chairman and chief executive of
American Continental, which is in bankruptcy proceedings.
   The thrift office and lawyers for Keating are due back in
Wilson's court in Los Angeles on Monday. The judge has indicated he
is likely to extend his orders against Keating, which initially
were made in the form of a 10-day temporary restraining order.
   The financial disclosure statement will not be made public.
Carolyn Lieberman, senior counsel for the thrift office, said last
week that regulators want to know if Keating transferred money out
of the country because he had traveled extensively in Switzerland
and the Bahamas in the last few years.
   Keating says he has never transferred funds overseas.

<HEAD>Desert Inn in Las Vegas Put Up for Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian put the Desert Inn
and Casino up for sale Tuesday, hoping to raise $200 million or
more to help finance a planned theme park and 5,000-room hotel on
the Las Vegas strip.
   In a statement, Kerkorian associate Fred Benninger said
developing the theme park project had reduced time to devote to the
Desert Inn, Howard Hughes' onetime flagship and one of the oldest
resorts in Las Vegas.
   Small by Las Vegas standards with 821 rooms, the Desert Inn has
found a successful niche catering to high-rollers from Asia. It
unofficially had been on the market for some time, analysts said.
   The 185-acre site has a championship golf course, 34 undeveloped
acres on the strip and another five acres on which luxury
condominiums could be built.
   Kerkorian hopes those factors will help sell the Desert Inn,
which is coming onto the market at a tough time. Junk bond and bank
financing for deals has dried up, and huge new resorts have sliced
away profits at older hotels.
   ``I think the buyer ... will be someone with vision and an
interest in fully developing the property,'' said Michael
Tennenbaum, a vice chairman at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the investment
banking firm retained to handle the sale.
   Tennenbaum said the Desert Inn's well-known name might be used
at a chain of hotels. He said the price ``could be in excess of
$200 million'' if the right buyer can be found. Bear Stearns is
looking worldwide.
   ``There are a couple of very famous Pacific Rim clients who go
there, and we suspect the Pacific Rim buyers are the most likely,''
he said.
   Kerkorian owns the Desert Inn through his Los Angeles-based MGM
Grand Inc., which also operates a luxury airline.
   MGM Grand announced last October it planned to lure families to
Las Vegas by building a movie theme park and huge hotel on the site
where the Tropicana Country Club and Marina Hotel now stand.
   Kerkorian is in the process of trying to sell MGM-UA
Communications Co. to Pathe Communications Corp. Pathe's chief,
Giancarlo Parretti, has agreed to pay $1.3 billion for MGM-UA, but
has yet to arrange financing.
   Kerkorian paid $167 million for both the Sands hotel-casino and
the Desert Inn when he bought them from Summa Corp. in September
1987. He sold the Sands in April 1988 for $110 million to
Massachusetts-based Interface Group.
   Business at some Las Vegas resorts has been sagging since last
November, when the 3,100-room Mirage resort opened to record gaming
revenues.
   Gaming figures are not broken down by the Nevada Gaming Control
Board. But other resorts, including Caesars Palace, acknowledged in
recent months that the Mirage has hurt their earnings.
   The 4,000-room Excalibur, billed as the world's largest resort,
opened in June to big crowds. However, it is aimed primarily at the
middle America market and does attract the type of players the
Desert Inn does.
   Other hotels have in the past year either announced or embarked
on expansions or remodeling projects in an effort to keep their
share of business, although overall gaming revenues for the Las
Vegas area are at record highs.
