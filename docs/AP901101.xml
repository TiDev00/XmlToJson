   When Ken Kesey regrouped the old Merry
Pranksters to drive across the country and maybe donate his
psychedelic bus to the Smithsonian Institution, he had another
trick up his sleeve.
   The bus currently on the road isn't the one that drove into the
lore of the psychedelic 1960s. It's a newer model incorporating
parts of the old and the Smithsonian doesn't want it, institution
spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said Thursday.
   Kesey and the Merry Pranksters became heroes when Tom Wolfe
chronicled their 1964 trip aboard the bus, named Further, in his
``Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.''
   Kesey was a bright new literary light then from his novels ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Sometimes a Great Notion.''
   This week, Kesey and some of the old gang boarded a wildly
painted bus, also named Further. Kesey said they were headed for
the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., though he wasn't sure he'd
give up the bus now since he was having such fun with it.
   Along the way, he's promoting his new book, ``The Further
Inquiry,'' in which the soul of Neal Cassady is put on trial.
Cassady was Further's driver, and the inspiration for the driver in
author Jack Kerouac's ``On the Road.''
   ``The truth is, we had no direct knowledge of his intention to
give the bus to (the Smithsonian) other than what we had been
reading in the paper,'' Jacobs said from Washington.
   ``A few years ago, some of our curators talked to some potential
fund-raisers about the possibility of purchasing or acquiring the
original bus used by Ken Kesey and restoring it. But we were never
successful in reaching Mr. Kesey directly.
   ``The current bus he is using is not even close to the
original,'' she added. ``Even if it were, the Smithsonian is not
interested in a replica.''
   Jacobs said the Smithsonian also was concerned that Kesey was
invoking its name without permission.
   At a stop in Berkeley, Calif., Kesey denied he had tried to pass
off the 1947 International school bus as the 1939 original.
   He said the driver's seat and other parts from the original were
put into the newer bus. Back home at his farm in Pleasant Hill, the
rusted hulk of the original Further sits in a field.
   Kesey said he was miffed at the Smithsonian for never contacting
him when it was interested in restoring his original bus.
   ``I thought it was a little presumptuous of them, and it was
time they deserved a little pranking,'' he said.
   As for Smithsonian officials, Jacobs said they could take a
joke, but wanted the public to know neither Kesey bus was bound for
the museum.
   ``While we appreciate Mr. Kesey's view, which we think is fun -
we need more humor in our lives - we want the general public to
know that is not the case.''

<TEXT>
   It's a tough campaign for president,
barbed with Polish humor, between the earthy shipyard worker who
founded Solidarity and the somber, laconic intellectual he chose as
prime minister.
   What do Poles think of the contest between Lech Walesa and Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in their first popular vote for the
presidency?
   Some call it Cham vs. Hamlet. Cham, pronounced ``ham,'' is
Polish for bumpkin.
   Others have asked: Will Mazowiecki declare his candidacy before
or after the election?
   Then there's the story of a problem Walesa had when he wanted to
reserve a burial site in Jerusalem next to Jesus Christ.
   He found the cost was $150,000, it goes, and said to his top
aide: ``I don't know, Krzysiek. Is it worth it for only three
days?''
   The duel between Eastern Europe's first non-Communist head of
government and the man who gave him the job has rekindled interest
in politics after months of hand-wringing by commentators over
post-Communist apathy.
   Nearly all conversations turn sooner or later to the question of
which one will occupy Belweder Palace, seat of Polish presidents.
   A man was even killed in a drunken dispute with his son-in-law
over who would be the better president, the state news agency
reported.
   Poland held parliamentary elections in June 1989 that were
largely free and democratic local elections in May, but this is the
first real contest because Solidarity candidates swept the earlier
votes.
   Surveys indicate the two former Solidarity allies are running
about even.
   Other candidates have ventured into the ring, including Roman
Bartoszcze of the Peasant Party and Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz of the
Social Democrats, formerly the Communists, but only Walesa and
Mazowiecki are given a real chance.
   If neither gets 50 percent of the votes Nov. 25, a runoff will
be held Dec. 9.
   Part of the fascination stems from their contrasting styles.
   Walesa is electric, speaking rapidly, seeming to bob and weave
through questions thrown at him from the crowd.
   Mazowiecki is ``grey on grey'' in the words of one newspaper,
shy and ponderous in speech but exuding character and moral
authority.
   Walesa declared early and began an aggressive campaign
immediately with meetings at factories, where he is strong, and
with academics, Mazowiecki's turf.
   In the first three weeks of October, Walesa visited nine cities,
saw more than 100,000 people and was seen by millions more on
television. Local Solidarity chapters organize his Western-style
rallies, held outdoors or in large arenas with banners, brass bands
and deafening loudspeakers.
   Mazowiecki made his first campaign appearance Oct. 14, two weeks
after Walesa, in the Krakow Philharmonic Hall, which seats only 800
people. Instead of direct questions from the crowd, he took written
ones that were rephrased by his campaign spokesman.
   The prime minister seems hesitant about contact with strangers.
Hundreds of people waited outside the hall in Krakow for two hours
and Mazowiecki rewarded them with only a few minutes on the
balcony, his stilted words of thanks barely audible through a
bullhorn.
   His dedication to his job, evident in his tired, careworn
appearance, earns sympathy even from people who say they will vote
for Walesa.
   After becoming prime minister in August 1989, Mazowiecki set a
considered, pragmatic course that won respect abroad and gave Poles
a sense of security against the sudden shocks of revolutionary
change.
   To many, however, Mazowiecki's government has seemed to drag its
feet, allowing former secret police to destroy records and keeping
Communist ministers in the government half a year after the party
dissolved.
   In his campaign, Walesa advocates faster change and has been
quoted as intending to use a ``sharp axe'' to chop away vestiges of
the old system.
   He and Mazowiecki also appear to disagree about policy toward
the Communist leadership. When he took office, the prime minister
spoke of drawing a line between present and past, but Walesa has
said he wants to ``settle accounts'' with those who have injured
Poland or stolen from it.
   If Walesa becomes president, Mazowiecki says, he will join the
opposition. Walesa replies that he already has five other
candidates for prime minister.
   Critics accuse Walesa of currying favor with the mob, promising
easy solutions he cannot deliver and becoming a demagogue who could
abuse the still-fragile democracy and frighten off Western
investors.
   ``I'll vote for Mazowiecki because, under his presidency, I can
sleep peacefully,'' Adam Michnik, a former Walesa adviser, told a
rally. ``If someone knocks at my door at 5 in the morning, it can
only be the milkman.''
   ``Walesa is as suitable to be president as I am to be a radio
announcer,'' Michnik, now editor of Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's
leading daily newspaper, said in a recent broadcast.
   Michnik spoke with his usual stutter.
   Walesa wished him luck in radio.

<HEAD>Mexico's President Says Happy Economic Days Are Here Again</HEAD>

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declared
Thursday that his reform program has propelled Mexico out of its
economic crisis, and he defended his decision to negotiate a
free-trade accord with the United States.
   But his comments, made in a state-of-the-union address, were
repeatedly interrupted by shouts of opposition lawmakers.
   ``We have left fear and weariness behind,'' he told this nation
of 81 million people in the nationally broadcast speech.
   He assured Mexicans their jealously guarded national sovereignty
would survive a free trade pact, the economic opening of Mexico's
borders, and the privatization of state businesses like banks and
telecommunications.
   ``Today, new channels are open to Mexican nationalism,'' he
said.
   Salinas took office in December 1988 during a protracted
financial crsis provoked in part by the worldwide plunge in oil
prices six years earlier.
   ``Today, we have left behind the most serious aspects of the
crisis, such as the foreign debt, and we are focusing our attention
on growth and justice,'' he said Thursday.
   The president also stressed stability, one of the proudest
boasts of his Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party has
governed Mexico for 61 years.
   ``Mexico has made significant progress. The economy is
recovering and has remained stable,'' he said. ``The political
system, despite the pressures to which it has been subjected, has
maintained internal order and been able to accomplish major
tasks.''
   Lawmakers from the conservative National Action Party and the
center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party interrupted his more
than two-hour speech with jeers and shouts ten times.
   ``Salinas: More Misery and Hunger in the Countryside,'' said a
bedsheet-sized banner held aloft by two opposition deputies.
   The president's comments about his administration's electoral
reform provoked one of the loudest outbursts.
   ``Total repudiation of electoral fraud!'' shouted lawmakers from
the Democratic Revolutionary Party, which says the governing
party's reforms of election procedure are insufficient to deter
vote fraud.
   The president, however, forged ahead without acknowledging
opposition outbursts. He received hearty applause from supporters.
   Salinas' ambitious economic reforms have been called a Mexican
version of Soviet perestroika.
   The president is opening a protected economy, divesting the
state of burdensome industries, trying to lure foreign investors,
and hoping to make Mexico a full-fledged competitor in the changing
world economy.
   In his speech, the 42-year-old, Harvard-trained economist said
he has eliminated the fiscal deficit, increased social spending,
made the tax burden fairer, and reduced the foreign debt from 60
percent of the gross national product to 40 percent.

   While her country celebrates the end of a half
century struggling under dictatorship, Rita Klimova finds herself
in a lonely new struggle.
   Last year's peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia elevated her
from hardship and obscurity to prominence and a challenging new
post.
   As post-Communist Czechoslovakia's first ambassador to
Washington, she was to be the voice of a democracy reborn after a
long night of Nazi and Stalinist repression.
   But she had barely settled into her 10-room ambassadorial
residence when high fever and what felt like severe flu sent her to
a hospital. After weeks of uncertainty and no improvement, she was
diagnosed as having leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells
that can be fatal.
   Some doctors speculated that Klimova had one of the thousands of
cases of cancer attributable to radioactive fallout from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Ukraine.
   ``Who's to say?'' she said. ``They asked me routinely if I have
been exposed to radioactive material and I said no, except for the
Chernobyl thing.''
   Mrs. Klimova, 58 and a widow, agonized in a July newspaper
interview about whether she should return home to avoid saddling
her government with huge bills for periodic, prolonged chemotherapy
treatments in U.S. hospitals. She said she might stay if she could
be fitted ``into someone's research plans.''
   The article helped get her admitted as a patient at the oncology
center of Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital, she said later. It is
one of 21 facilities in the United States for comprehensive cancer
therapy.
   ``I sort of panicked when I found out about leukemia,'' Mrs.
Klimova recalled in an interview. To boost her morale she invited
her son, a 24-year-old Prague journalist, to visit. They toured the
Manhattan neighborhood where she lived with her parents during
World War II, perfecting English with a New York accent. The son,
Vladimir Mlynar, stayed through her first week of chemotherapy.
   ``When they actually give you chemotherapy, you feel miserable,
and his last words to me after that very trying week, were, `we
licked the communists and you've got to lick this,' and then he
left,'' she said.
   Mrs. Klimova spent most of August in the hospital. There, she
dealt with her mail and maintained telephone contact with her staff
and Capitol Hill seeking support for the most important legislation
affecting Czechoslovakia - restoration of U.S. import concessions
for goods from friendly countries, known as most-favored-nation
treatment.
   The ambassador estimates the concessions could boost exports to
the United States - $82 million in 1989 - by $1.7 million a month.
``For Czechoslovakia,'' she said, ``that's a lot of money.''
   Restoration of the concessions had been expected in the spring,
after the two countries concluded a trade agreement. But the
follow-up authorization got caught in Congress' annual logjam, and
it finally was cleared on Oct. 24.
   Mrs. Klimova was back in the hospital at the time, undergoing a
six-week siege of chemotherapy expected to last well into November.
She hopes it will be the last interruption to her new job.
   ``I was lucky to have a foreign minister who is willing to put
up with an ambassador who occasionally pulls a disappearing act,''
Mrs. Klimova said.
   She and the foreign minister, Jiri Dienstbier, go way back.
``She was once my teacher'' at Charles University, he said.
   But her life changed after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that
ended the brief reform period dubbed the ``Prague Spring.''
   Mrs. Klimova lost her economics professorship in the
post-invasion purge of thousands of reform-minded Czechoslovaks.
She worked later as a freelance translator and became active in the
Charter 77 dissident movement along with playwright Vaclav Havel,
now the Czech president, and Dienstbier. Both men spent time in
prison for such activity.
   Mrs. Klimova became well-known as the English language
translator and spokeswoman of Civic Forum, Havel's popular
movement, when foreign television crews and journalists crowded
into Prague during the 1989 peaceful revolution that ended
communist rule.
   ``Then, all of a sudden, I found myself in the States in such
wonderful circumstances until this disease came,'' she said. ``I
hope I can get it out of the way, and then really get down to my
job as ambassador.''

   A 7-year-old girl who collapsed
while trick-or-treating died of a congenital heart defect, not
because of poisoned candy, authorities said.
   Ariel Katz, 7, collapsed and died while trick-or-treating
Wednesday night with friends and two chaperones.
   Police had said they were checking candy the girl had eaten to
see if it was poisoned, and they urged parents to withhold sweets
collected in the area where she had been trick-or-treating.
   But the Los Angeles County coroner attributed the death to an
enlarged heart, police Sgt. Bill Brucker said Thursday.

<TEXT>
   If there are any male chauvinist pigs still on
the prowl, they'd better steer clear of Linda Hooper, the Annie
Oakley of the FBI.
   She looks every inch the all-American woman until she opens her
glen plaid jacket to reveal a black, .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson
five-shot revolver tucked demurely in her skirt waist.
   It would be just the thing for silencing the jeers of hard hats
perched in the sky, or quickly cooling the ardor of subway mashers.
   But Mrs. Hooper, who is 39 and married to another FBI special
agent, says macho men never bother her. Besides, she says, agents
never play around with guns.
   ``We only shoot when our life or someone else's life is in
danger,'' says the Orange County, Calif., native who grew up
plinking tin cans with her grandfather's .22-caliber squirrel
rifle.
   In her six years with the FBI, Mrs. Hooper has never fired her
gun, even while chasing bank robbers, drug pushers, kidnappers and
plane hijackers during her first assignment in Portland, Ore.
   ``But I've been in situations where I've pulled it and pointed
it,'' she says, ``and I will use it if I have to.''
   A member of an elite club of sharpshooters among the FBI's 982
female agents, Mrs. Hooper is in charge of the indoor shooting
range at FBI headquarters. There she demonstrates her firearm
skills for the half-million visitors who tramp through the building
annually on the most popular guided tour in Washington.
   Crouching with feet wide apart, Mrs. Hooper shreds the torso of
a silhouette target with noisy bursts from such FBI weapons as the
Sig Sauer P-226 9mm semiautomatic pistol and the lightweight
Heckler &amp; Koch MP-5 fully automatic submachine gun, which can turn
a miscreant into mincemeat at 800 rounds per minute.
   As a sentimental gesture, she occasionally fires a .45-caliber
Thompson submachine gun, the notorious ``Tommy gun'' favored by
gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s which was retired from the FBI
arsenal in 1979.
   Interviewed next to a glass case containing the straw hat,
eyeglasses and cigar found on gangster John Dillinger's body the
night he was gunned down in Chicago in 1934, Mrs. Hooper said her
sex has helped rather than hindered her work as an FBI agent.
   ``I like it the way it is because I consider being a woman as my
cover,'' she said.
   Even though male FBI agents outnumber female agents by 10-1, she
said, women sometimes can outperform men in dangerous situations.
   She mentioned the time she tricked a suspected Portland bank
robber into opening his apartment door and submitting to quick,
visual surveillance without arousing his suspicion. She doubts that
a male agent wearing a business suit could have done the same
thing.
   ``When I go up to your door, you'll think I'm selling Avon or
Tupperware. You won't think I'm an FBI agent,'' she said. ``When I
asked the bank robber if he knew where `Julie' was, he thought I
was some dumb broad.''
   Even so, being a woman does have its drawbacks.
   ``I don't like those short women's jackets that are so
fashionable these days, because it's hard to carry your gun under
them,'' Mrs. Hooper said. And the skirts without belt loops have
forced her to use a clip-on holster.
   Mrs. Hooper is no trigger-happy TV cop but a proud, no-nonsense
professional who hopes the visiting school children who watch her
firearms display won't get the wrong idea.
   ``We're not trying to glamorize guns in any way, but they're
part of what our job is all about,'' she said. ``I always tell the
kids that if they find a gun at a friend's house or on the street,
don't touch it. Guns are very dangerous.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet proposals for an Arab
diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis are unlikely to succeed, but
could be the last buffer against war, Arab and Western observers
say.
   ``There is no Arab solution,'' said a well-connected Saudi
businessman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The time isn't
right and the Arabs are too divided. Saddam thinks time is in his
favor.''
   Foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria met in the
Saudi summer capital of Jiddah Wednesday night to discuss Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for an emergency Arab
summit.
   Few details about the talks filtered out.
   ``I don't see the Arab solution as being different from the
international solution'' by the United Nations, said a Western
diplomat in Riyadh, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, one of the first Arab leaders
to align against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, noted previous
Arab summits failed to come up with a workable solution. Saudi
newspapers quoted Mubarak as saying the meeting would become ``a
summit of insults.''
   Cairo's state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper wrote that Gorbachev's
proposal serves Saddam's ``strategy of stalling, in the belief that
time is on his side.''
   After Saddam sent his troops into Kuwait Aug. 2, U.N.
resolutions have demanded an unconditional pullout from the
oil-rich emirate and imposed an economic embargo on Iraq.
   There was widespread confusion about Saudi intentions last week
when the defense minister, Prince Sultan, referred to previous
territorial concessions made by Saudi Arabia in border disputes
with his neighbors.
   Some interpreted his remarks as a hint that Riyadh was willing
to compromise over Iraq's demands for a strip of northern Kuwait as
well as the two Kuwaiti islands of Warba and Bubiyan. They dominate
Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf and have long been coveted by
Baghdad.
   Prince Sultan issued a statement saying he had been
misinterpreted. King Fahd stressed Saudi demands for an
unconditional Iraqi pullout has not changed.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's principal arms supplier during the
8-year war against Iran and the two countries have a friendship
treaty.
   Gorbachev's envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, has traveled to Baghdad
twice to meet with Saddam in search of a diplomatic solution. But
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the latest mission
failed.
   That did not prevent Gorbachev from hinting in Paris that Iraq
may be softening its stand. He warned against rushing toward a
military solution, saying the coming days ``might bring some
clarification'' of a change in Iraq's position.
   In one version, reported last month by the Soviet news agency
Novosti, Primakov was quoted as saying Iraq might withdraw from
most of Kuwait if it could keep the northern strip and the two
islands.
   Saddam has annexed Kuwait and declared it Iraq's 19th province.
But he has attached the islands and the northern strip, whose oil
wells are an extension of Iraq's Rumailah field, to Iraq's Basra
province.
   Iraq denied it was contemplating making a deal to keep the
territories. The Saudis, the United States and the Kuwaiti
government-in-exile have rejected any such solution.
   Adding to the tense mood, Saudi Arabia's pro-government Asharq
al-Awsat daily reported the meeting of Arab foreign ministers in
Jiddah under the headline ``Gulf Crisis Heats Up.''
   The secretary-general of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council, Abdullah Bishara of Kuwait, told reporters earlier in the
week that war would erupt in the gulf soon unless a diplomatic
solution were found.
   ``We're very close to the last chapter of diplomatic
activities,'' he said. ``I think we'll be very close to the chapter
of inferno.''

   Actors Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox and White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu are short in stature but tall on
style, said a clothier who put them on his list of the ``10
Best-Dressed Shorter Men in America.''
   Bob Stern, the 5-foot-2 president of Short Sizes Inc., said he
created the annual list four years ago to ``highlight that short
men can dress for success.''
   Cruise and Sununu are the tallest short men on the list. Both
just reach 5-foot-9, the maximum height for the list.
   Cruise is a trendsetter who has turned black sunglasses and
black silk shirts into a national passion, while Sununu ``never
beats around the bush'' in both politics and dress, Stern said.
   Fox, 5-foot-5, was named to the list for the third consecutive
year for ``charmingly combining a tux jacket and shirt with washed
jeans and tennis shoes,'' Stern said.
   Others listed, in ``descending'' order, are novelist Tom Wolfe
and the former host of television's ``This Old House,'' Bob Vila,
both 5-foot-8; singer Billy Joel, Broadway actor Robert Morse and
Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White, 5-foot-7; gymnast and television
sports analyst Bart Connor, 5-foot-6; and actor-director Danny
DeVito, 5-foot-1.

   More than 1.5 million people have been
displaced by the Persian Gulf crisis, World Bank officials and
other sources say.
   And hundreds of thousands of workers from the Third World remain
in Iraq and Kuwait. The numbers dwarf the approximately 1,000
hostages from the United States, 1,400 from Britain and 3,000 from
the Soviet Union.
   Hundreds of thousands of others are returning to their distant
homelands, some as far away as the Philippines and South Korea,
said officials at the World Bank, which coordinates aid at its
Washington headquarters for the hardest-hit countries.
   The foreigners were lured to the Middle East by the better wages
that Iraq and Kuwait could pay because of income from oil.
   The largest and most recent group forced from their homes are
citizens of Yemen who have been living in Saudi Arabia, some of
them for decades. The Saudi government is retaliating against Yemen
because of Yemeni sympathy for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
   About 2 million of the 12 million people in Saudi Arabia were
Yemeni. The newly united republic of Yemen also has a population of
nearly 12 million. The uncertain border between the two countries
runs for thousands of miles, much of it through the desolate area
called the ``Empty Quarter.'' A report from Yemen estimated the
number of Yemenis who have fled across it at 750,000.
   Arntraud Hartmann, who works on the problem at the World Bank,
told a meeting on refugees this week that the number of displaced
Yemenis was about 500,000. But she added that it was not known how
many more may have to go. About 20,000 a day were reported leaving
in early October. Estimates were imprecise in part because large
families sometimes travel on one passport.
   ``We don't handle immediate relief,'' Ms. Hartmann said of the
World Bank's role. ``Others do that better. We're concerned with
making loans that will create jobs and do other things to ease the
impact.''
   Refugees need food, housing and jobs and are always an immediate
burden.
   The World Bank is the biggest source of aid to the Third World,
lending more than $20 billion last year. Its staff is speeding up
loans to the countries badly hit by the gulf crisis and is expected
to report in the next few weeks to its 154 member governments.
   Peter Riddleberger, a bank spokesman, said many countries have
been doubly hurt: they have lost the hard cash that their citizens
used to send home from Iraq and Kuwait, and they now have to spend
their own money and whatever help they can get on finding homes and
jobs for them.
   In addition, countries that import oil must pay the high prices
brought on by the crisis. Some have also lost valuable trade
because of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq.
   Egypt is one of the hardest-hit countries. Ms. Hartmann
estimated that 380,000 Egyptians have fled Iraq and Kuwait, with
perhaps as many more to come. A.S. Abderahman, second secretary at
the Egyptian embassy here, said that when the crisis began there
were 800,000 to 1 million Egyptians in Iraq, mostly farm workers
and manual laborers.
   Others put the number as high as 1.3 million.
   ``Iraq needed farm workers and made them welcome,'' Abderahman
told the meeting on refugees. ``The Iraqis made some of them Iraqi
citizens. Some were drafted and taken prisoner in the war with
Iran. Some will want to stay in Iraq.''
   An additional 200,000 Egyptians worked in Kuwait and had an
estimated $8 billion deposited in Kuwaiti banks, Abderahman said.
Others say there were as many as 300,000 Egyptians.
   Egyptians working in Iraq and Kuwait sent home more than $1.65
billion a year in hard currency, much valued in their country's
cash-starved economy.
   Jordan, Iraq's neighbor, has been hardest hit of all. A country
of only 3 million people, it must try to absorb about 220,000
returning citizens. Many are professionals and skilled workers for
whom there are no jobs in sight, Ms. Hartmann said.
   Fran Sullivan of the International Organization for Migration,
which works with the United Nations, said India had brought home
about 150,000 citizens. Figures reported from Cyprus, a center for
news from the Middle East, put the number at 85,000 each from
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS BIDDLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On an average of three times a day,
a hand-picked team of armed U.S. sailors boards merchant ships in
the Red Sea that might be trying to break a U.N. embargo to get
supplies to Iraq.
   ``We're the Red Sea Highway Patrol,'' said gunner's mate William
``Bo'' Kitchens, 27, of Lakeland, Fla., a member of Boarding Team
Alpha aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Biddle.
   ``We should put a red and blue light atop the ship with a siren.
It's more police work than anything else. We're stopping contraband
from reaching its goal,'' Kitchens said after an interdiction this
week.
   The United Nations authorized the naval quarantine to punish
Iraq for its Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait. Nothing but medical
supplies are allowed in, and no ships, including tankers carrying
Iraq's lifeblood of oil exports, are getting out.
   Much of the seagoing police work is done in the northern Red
Sea, which includes traffic coming south from the Suez Canal and
bound for the Jordanian port o Aqaba.
   The port is a potential opening in the international effort
because land routes from there lead across Jordan into Iraq.
   What was one of the world's busiest shipping lanes just three
months ago now has more warships than merchant vessels.
   ``The shipping volume has been substantially throttled down.
There's been an 80 percent reduction in the volume of shipping,''
said Rear Adm. Nick Gee, commander of Red Sea operations by the
Maritime Interdiction Force.
   One of the warships plying the azure blue waters is the Biddle,
part of the task force accompanying the aircraft carrier USS
Saratoga.
   ``It's a total roadblock. This is a very effective blockade,''
said Capt. Louis Harlow, the Biddle's skipper. ``Nobody can leak
through. Anything that moves, we've got them. The Iraqis have to be
hurting.''
   A ring of warships is on patrol around the Arabian peninsula,
which is bounded by the Red Sea, Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
   Since the embargo began in August, 3,107 ships have been
intercepted, with 310 boarded. Almost all of the boardings have
occurred in the Red Sea.
   Navy officials said 23 cargo ships have been diverted to other
ports, including 10 ships bound for Aqaba or other ports because
something was suspicious.
   For example, the Biddle refused passage to one ship carrying
potassium nitrate, an ingredient for gunpowder. Others have been
turned away because their manifests did not jibewith their cargo.
   ``A lot of Iraqi ships are at anchor in port. They're not even
making the attempt,'' said Cmdr. Mark Merchat, public affairs
officer for Navy Central Command.
   He said that in the gulf itself, traffic to and from Iraq ``is
virtually at a standstill.''
   In a typical operation, a U.S. warship or other units of the
multinational armada enforcing the sanctions will hail a merchant
ship and ask its destination or cargo.
   Anything bound for Aqaba is immediately under suspicion. Other
things that draw attention are ship's names that are painted over
or ships that are sailing courses that differ from their announced
destination.
   Earlier this week, the Biddle stopped the Greek container ship
Zim Venezia, which was headed for Eilat, Israel, right next door to
Aqaba.
   A 20-man boarding team carrying sidearms and shotguns and
wearing black flak jackets scurried down a rope ladder onto a
26-foot whale boat for a 1,500-yard trip to the merchant ship.
   The boarding party, consisting of Navy and U.S. Coast Guard
personnel, checked the ship's paperwork and crew before it was
allowed to continue. During the mission, a warplane dispatched by
the Saratoga buzzed the area.
   That interdiction lasted about four hours. Some can take 14
hours or longer if cargo is checked.
   Many are done at night, which makes the operation a bit dicier.
   ``It kind of gives you an eerie feeling at night, but it doesn't
change our job any,'' said Coast Guard Ensign Chris Clark, 32, of
Cape Cod, Mass.
   Clark's last job was working interdictions against drug
smugglers in the Caribbean, which he considered a more dangerous
assignment than the work he's doing now.
   ``With drug interdictions, you never know what you're going to
run across. There are more unknowns,'' Clark said. ``Out here,
we're on guard but we're not overly aggressive. We're firm but
polite.''
   The Red Sea crew has its share of surprises. One time, a Soviet
ship was told to divert, and its captain radioed back: ``I have
your boarding party hostage.''
   When the boarding team gave him startled glances, the captain
quickly replied: ``That's a joke. Just kidding.''
   The Navy has nicknamed the Red Sea operation Toto Station, after
the line in ``The Wizard of Oz'' when Judy Garland tells her dog,
``Gee, Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.''
   The Suez Canal is dubbed the Yellow Brick Road. Warships refer
to sectors with codenames like Emerald City, Wizard, Oz, Wicked
Witch and Tin Man.

<HEAD>India's Religious Dispute is 105 Years Old</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The religious dispute that has killed
more than 200 people in nine days and threatened to bring down the
government has its roots in a 105-year-old court case.
   In 1885, a Hindu priest filed a lawsuit claiming a small plot of
land in the town of Ayodhya was the birthplace of the Lord Rama,
the much-revered warrior-god. The priest also claimed that the
unpretentious three-domed mosque on the site was built over what
had once been a Hindu temple.
   Sixty-one years later, the court decreed that the site was a
mosque and dismissed the priest's claim.
   The legal snarl was revived in 1949 when an idol of Rama was
spirited into the building. The mosque was locked by court order
and closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent
religious strife.
   In 1986, another court order re-opened the mosque, but only to
Hindus. Riots over the decision killed at least 200 people.
   Around the same time, the fundamentalist World Hindu Council
called for the removal of the 460-year-old Babri mosque and the
construction of a temple in its place.
   The group was not particularly well-known at the time, but it
gathered increasing support. In 1989, it announced definitive plans
for the temple construction and said it would raise $14 million for
the project.
   Religious riots broke out again, this time claiming at least 900
lives.
   After a year of futile government efforts to halt the campaign,
the group said Hindu holy men had deemed Oct. 30, 1990, as an
auspicious day to start the construction.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government vowed to halt the
attempt, although this stand cost it the support of the Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party. The desertion relegated the government to a
minority in Parliament.
   Singh faces the possibility of losing a vote of confidence Nov.
7.
   On Tuesday, thousands of Hindus stormed the mosque. At least
seven people died when police opened fire, but many youths broke
through security cordons, raced through the narrow, winding lanes
leading to the site and planted orange Hindu flags on the domes.
   Three more bodies were later found in a river and were thought
to be victims of Tuesday's violence.
   What is most worrisome about the outbreak of violence, say
newspapers and political commentators, is the widespread support
the Hindu campaign has received, which could foreshadow an unending
cycle of religious strife.
   India's 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu and 12 percent
Moslem, but the country has been officialy secular since it gained
independence in 1947. Hindu-Moslem riots have periodically flared
but usually have been sparked by local issues and quickly resolved.
   ``India is entering a period when all the values it cherishes
are in peril,'' The Statesman newspaper editorialized Thursday.
``On the survival of this one mosque may depend the survival of
India as we know it.''

<HEAD>Bush's Tough Talk on Iraq Could Boost GOP Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tough presidential talk about Iraq's Saddam
Hussein is dominating the news again to the potential advantage of
Republican candidates struggling to recover from tax and budget
blues, analysts say.
   At a campaign-trail news conference in Florida, Bush conceded
Thursday that mixing statements on the Persian Gulf with campaign
rhetoric was ``a little bit awkward because we are a few days
before an election and I want to continue to work for Republican
candidates.''
   ``It's having a big political impact,'' Democratic pollster
Celinda Lake said of the presidential rhetoric. But she also called
it ``very high-risk strategy'' for the president.
   ``What he's tinkering with is the most robust part of his
image,'' Lake said. ``If he creates cynicism in the one part of his
image that's still very robust ... he's in for a much harder
presidency.''
   A sign of the kind of trouble Bush could encounter came in this
statement from Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations:
   ``If the president wants politics to end at the water's edge, he
has an obligation to leave events beyond the water's edge out of
campaign politics.''
   ``The agenda has switched to foreign policy,'' said Democratic
pollster Peter Hart.
   ``He (Bush) has been very effective in moving the agenda at
least somewhat off the focus on the budget and off taxes,'' said
Lake. ``I think he figured out he could not reshape voters'
impressions about taxes ... so that he had to get voters' minds off
of that.''
   At a briefing on Senate races, Rick Shelby, political director
of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said prospects
have become more positive for GOP candidates.
   ``One of the reasons the environment improved (is) the focus is
no longer entirely on the budget,'' said Shelby.
   For the past week, Democrats exulted as campaign surveys
reported growing support for their party from voters who agreed
with their contention that Bush and his party were tilting to the
rich in the budget negotiations. The argument came to be dubbed
``the fairness issue.''
   In state after state, polls found Democratic candidates gaining
ground. In some cases, Republicans once thought to be safe suddenly
found themselves in very tight races. In others, Republican
challengers dropped far behind Democratic incumbents.
   Hart said he couldn't say if the shift in Bush's focus had
boosted the prospects of Republican candidates. But the pollster
added that ``there's no longer the sense that they're still losing
ground. Whether they've started dramatically to pick up ground is
less certain.''
   ``What they have to hope for is they get a minor rebound,'' said
Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. ``My sense is
they've slapped a bottom on the domestic policy hemorrhage.''
   The decline that appeared to be sending Republicans toward a
major defeat next Tuesday already had begun to slow after the
budget agreement was reached and Congress adjourned.
   Left open was the question of whether a shift of emphasis to
foreign policy would alter the overall dynamic of the election and
create a national issue that would turn the tie in the
Republicans' favor.
   ``Unless something actually happens (in the Persian Gulf), then
all this scene-setting is only marginal, that you're not going to
change the dynamic,'' said Phillips.
   ``I don't think it's necessarily changed the dynamics of the
election,'' said Hart.
   GOP pollster Robert Teeter said he didn't know of any races
where the Persian Gulf was ``a particularly important issue. I
think it's important to the public impression of the president.''
   Lake said that during the budget negotiations, people responded
to polls by saying ``this is a bad package, Bush is doing this,
Bush is on the side of the rich.''
   Now, she said, ``he has very, very effectively moved the focus
off himself in terms of taxes.'' She contended the fairness issue
remains potent but with slightly diminished momentum.

<HEAD>Once Viewed as Shoo-in, Boschwitz Scrambles to Keep Senate Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The upheaval in the Minnesota governor's race
has battered Rudy Boschwitz as well, forcing the Republican senator
to scramble in a re-election bid once thought to be a sure thing.
   ``He better bring out the heavy artillery. I think he needs
it,'' said Selden Hanson, Minnesota 8th District GOP chairman.
``Three weeks ago I didn't even worry. Now I hope we win. I've got
my fingers crossed.''
   Boschwitz, seeking a third term, had been considered to have one
of the safest senatorial re-election bids this year against
Democrat Paul Wellstone, a political science professor at Carleton
College.
   But his fortunes have turned in the 2{ weeks since allegations
of skinny-dipping with teen-age girls and adultery rang out against
Minnesota's one-time Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jon
Grunseth.
   ``I think it has affected my campaign negatively,'' Boschwitz
said Thursday. ``That's an advantage to a newcomer, no doubt about
it.''
   As Wellstone was gaining attention through a series of catchy TV
ads, the Minnesota Republican Party was shaken Oct. 15 by the
initial allegations against Grunseth. Boschwitz initially supported
Grunseth but later urged his withdrawal. Grunseth bowed out on
Sunday.
   The developments appeared to take their toll on Boschwitz. An
independent public opinion poll conducted Oct. 19-21 showed the
Boschwitz-Wellstone race a virtual draw, compared with a 15-point
Boschwitz lead less than two weeks earlier.
   Boschwitz returned to Minnesota the day the new poll figures
were published, saying, ``I have to get back and campaign.''
   ``My own political situation has gotten worse because of the
governor's race,'' Boschwitz said while campaigning in Duluth on
Tuesday. ``When I wrapped my arms around Grunseth, my poll numbers
dropped precipitously.''
   Wellstone has repeatedly portrayed himself as David against
Goliath because Boschwitz had amassed a campaign war chest of more
than $7 million to Wellstone's less than $1 million.
   He has accused Boschwitz of dodging responsibility for the $3
trillion national debt, lacking compassion for the poor and
disadvantaged and compromising the interests of average Minnesotans
by accepting campaign donations from big out-of-state businesses.
   Humorous television ads, which show the bouncy Wellstone talking
and walking in fast motion, have made the challenger easy to
recognize. And Boschwitz changed his vote on civil rights
legislation after Wellstone criticized the initial vote.
   ``Now look at what the polls show. I'll tell you, I've climbed
on top of Goliath's $7 million. I'm looking at him straight in the
face,'' Wellstone said at a rally last week.
   But Wellstone was on the defensive this week after Boschwitz
said the challenger's national health care plan would result in the
shutdown of the Mayo Clinic and that Wellstone's spending proposals
would require a doubling of taxes.
   The senator also said Wellstone had been arrested for
trespassing during protests against the Vietnam war and the farm
crisis. And he caused a stir when he called on Wellstone to
renounce a plan by a street gang to pass out Democratic campaign
literature. Wellstone said he didn't know of the plan.
   ``He has gone after me and after me and after me for 10 weeks
with very, very negative stuff,'' Boschwitz said Thursday. ``So the
time had come to take the offensive. Nobody was explaining and
defining Paul Wellstone. That's what we wanted to do, so that
people understood what he was about and what he was saying.''
   And Boschwitz hoped to get a big boost today with President
Bush's appearance in Rochester on his behalf.
   Political science professor Charles Backstrom of the University
of Minnesota said that either Boschwitz is running scared or wants
his supporters to think he is.
   ``He wants his supporters to come out and work for him and
vote,'' Backstrom said.
   ``You really want them working their hardest and their best in
the last 10 days,'' said D.J. Leary, a longtime Democratic
political consultant.
   Wellstone campaign manager John Blackshaw discounted the notion
that Boschwitz was merely pretending to be nervous.
   ``I think he is legitimately scared. I hesitate to think that he
is that arrogant to think he doesn't have any problems in his own
Senate race,'' Blackshaw said.
   Boschwitz ally Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican congressman,
believes the narrowing gap between Boschwitz and Wellstone is part
of the national backlash Republicans are feeling over tax increases
and Medicare cuts in the federal budget.
   ``It's not a Boschwitz problem, it's a Republican problem,''
Weber said.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Documents in Iraqi Hands Said Unlikely to Compromise U.S.</HEAD>

   Iraqi troops seized scores of documents when
they invaded Kuwait, but the papers are unlikely to compromise the
United States because of Kuwait's limited intelligence service,
officials and private analysts say.
   ``They obviously got a lot of documents,'' said Ali Al-Sabah, a
spokesman for the Kuwait Embassy. ``They have to sift through them
and they have the labor to do that.''
   Attention focused on Kuwaiti documents Wednesday when Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat released one he said was taken from
files at Kuwait's internal security bureau after the Aug. 2
invasion.
   But officials said the fact that the documents belonged to
Kuwait makes the situation different from 1979, when Iranian
revolutionaries seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   In that instance, Iranian students pieced together shredded U.S.
documents in an effort to gain some insight into official American
activities in Iran.
   Diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad are known to have
shredded sensitive documents, according to U.S. officials.
   It is likely that the handful of diplomats trapped at the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait have done the same thing, said Neil Livingstone,
an adjunct professor at Georgetown University who is a specialist
on terrorism.
   Livingstone said he doubted the Iraqis have learned much about
U.S. intelligence from the Kuwaiti documents.
   ``This is not the Rolls Royce of intelligence services,'' he
said. ``They didn't have wide knowledge of the United States.''
   Al-Sabah said the Kuwaiti inelligence service was small and
reported to the interior minister.
   Most Kuwaiti security work involved keeping tabs on foreigners
working inside the country. ``We are talking about a little country
that doesn't have a lot of assets,'' Livingstone said.
   A U.S. diplomat familiar with Kuwait agreed. Although the United
States and Kuwait were allies, Washington was cautious about
sharing secret information with Kuwait because that country also
had good relations with the Soviet Union, said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The two countries cooperated in reflagging Kuwaiti tankers
during the Iran-Iraq war in 1987, but much of that information
would be dated, officials said.
   Of more concern to the United States is the military hardware
that Iraq stole from Kuwait, Livingstone said.
   ``They got a lot of goodies out of Kuwait,'' he said. There have
been unconfirmed reports that Iraq has seized U.S.-made HAWK
missiles that were sold to Kuwait.
   Even so, Livingstone said the United States did not have a large
military presence in Kuwait.
   The memo provided Wednesday by Al-Mashat purports to be from the
director general of the state security department to the Kuwaiti
interior minister, detailing a meeting the security chief had with
CIA Director William Webster on Nov. 14, 1989.
   In the document, Kuwaiti Brig. Fahd Ahmad Al-Fahd said he and
Webster agreed on a number of points. Among them:
   -``We agreed with the U.S. side that it was important to combat
drugs in the country after the CIA narcotics experts informed us
that much Kuwaiti capital is being used to promote drug trafficking
in Pakistan and Iran, and that the spread of such trafficking will
have negative consequences for the future of Kuwait.''
   -``We agreed with the American side that it was important to
take advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in Iraq in
order to put pressure on that country's government to delineate our
common border,'' the document said.
   The CIA said statements contained in the document are
fabrications.
   Ali Al-Sabah, a spokesman for the Kuwaiti embassy, said the
document - written in Arabic - appeared to have been altered. But
Al-Mashat insisted on the document's authenticity.
   The document also provided a telephone number said to be
Webster's private line. A telephone answering machine with a
woman's voice answers the number.

<TEXT>
   President Bush evidently set out this week to
rattle Iraq, but he may have wound up rattling everyone - including
himself - on whether he is about to go to war against Saddam
Hussein.
   As a result, Bush toned down the rhetoric a little bit Thursday
as he came to a news conference equipped with past statements that
matched his recent bellicosity.
   ``Some are saying there is a shift here, a dramatic shift,'
Bush said, denying any inconsistency on his part. Indeed, he had
called the Iraqi president barbaric in the past.
   ``I am not trying to sound the tocsin of war,'' he said, easing
off slightly.
   Bush explained he was just trying to get the focus back where it
belonged - on Iraq's unacceptable invasion of Kuwait - after some
digression over the budget and his dealings with Congress.
   ``I am not going to discuss what or will not trigger an armed
conflict,'' he said.
   There is no denying, however, that the country is experiencing a
siege of war nerves, and it extends to Capitol Hill. House Speaker
Thomas Foley and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
Tuesday they were worried that a growing number of people feel war
is unavoidable.
   At the very least, Congress wants to exercise what many members
perceive to be its constitutional right to decide whether to
declare war.
   But Bush told the leaders Tuesday that while he would continue
to seek their advice and support in shaping U.S. policy, they must
understand ``that any such commitment must be hedged, given the
unpredictable and dynamic circumstances of this crisis.''
   Indeed, the rattling rhetoric one day, and the emphasis in
seeking a peaceful solution another day, could be calculated to
confuse Saddam.
   If that is Bush's purpose, he obviously cannot admit it.
   Nor can he explain the shifts of emphasis to the American people
without giving his strategy away.
   And yet, an argument can be made that the president has an
obligation to explain to Congress and the American people what
would trigger an armed conflict.
   It's hard to say whether that would provide Baghdad with
critical information to help prepare for war, but it probably would
enhance Bush's chances of getting support at home once an attack
was launched.
   Explaining why he had taken a hard line of late, Bush said
Thursday he wanted the American people to know how strongly he felt
about the plight of the nine diplomats and others holding out in
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and Americans detained in Iraq.
   Some are being used as human shields at strategic installations
to deter U.S. attack.
   Bush said relatives of the hostages would be discouraged from
accepting an Iraqi offer to make holiday visits. And he called the
Iraqi invitation ``a canard.''
   The emphasis Bush placed on the plight of the hostages and the
diplomats could be evidence that he, indeed, is now more inclined
to use force and that he has begun to justify a war to the American
people.
   And yet, in late August, the president said the hostages would
not affect his policy toward Iraq. That is, he said he would not be
deterred from taking military action by threats to the Americans.
   ``I will not change the policy of the United States (to) pay
homage or to give credibility to this brutal move of staking out
citizens and a brutal move of holding people against their will,''
he said on Aug. 30.
   At this point, however, their situation could be the very reason
Bush uses force.
   He said Wednesday he had ``had it'' with Iraq's treatment of the
hostages and the diplomats. He accused Iraq of trying to starve out
Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and the other besieged Americans at the
embassy.
   ``I must keep this in focus for the American people,'' he said.

   The Marsalis family, the highest profile family
in jazz, performed together in public for the first time at a
benefit here. The spirit was warm and the music was wonderful.
   Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis plays a dull-finish trumpet but the
notes are bright and shining. He was the relaxed host Wednesday
night, introducing tunes with endearing glimpses of family life.
Older brother Branford, who leads his own group, played tenor
saxophone. Jason, 13, made his New York debut and charmed the
audience with his thin look, unaffected manner and drumming. Their
father, Ellis, played piano.
   Delfeayo, trombonist and record producer, wasn't there. Wynton
said, ``Mother would say she used to sing. She'd go to the piano
and do a terrible rendition of `Embraceable You.' We knew it was
time to get the horns out. Paying our respects to our mother who's
not here tonight, we'll play `Embraceable You.'''
   Wynton played it bebop style, but sweet, slow and satisfying.
Branford's solo was tuneful and mellow.
   One of the first tunes that he and Branford played together,
Wynton said, was Charlie Parker's ``Air Conditioning.'' ``We
haven't played it in a long time. It might be a little rusty.'' It
wasn't.
   Wynton played with his nattily dressed six-man group on the show
opener, Duke Ellington's ``Play the Blues and Go.'' In more than
two hours without intermission at Alice Tully Hall, the grouping
kept changing. ``A tune he taught me when I was in high school,''
is how Wynton introduced himself and his father's subtly swinging
``Big Butter and Egg Man.'' They also played a lovely ``The Very
Thought of You,'' Wynton using a furry tone and taking some
discreet note-bending chances.
   ``The only reason we're playing this is my Daddy likes it,''
Wynton said before his group played his composition, ``The Majesty
of the Blues,'' which has much piano complexity. An Ellis Marsalis
composition, ``Swinging at the Haven,'' featured Ellis, Branford
and Jason Marsalis.
   The concert ended with an encore, ``In the Court of King
Oliver,'' by bassist Reginald Veal, drummer Herlin Riley, Ellis and
Wynton. Wynton ended it by walking off stage playing each phrase
quieter than the one before.
   The evening was a benefit for Graham-Windham Services to family
and children, the Autism Society of America and the
Immunohematology Research Foundation which develops therapies for
autistic patients.
   Wynton said, near the end of the concert, ``I have a little
brother who's autistic. You know it's a worthy cause.''
   At the beginning of the evening he dedicated ``this evening's
swing'' to drummer-band leader Art Blakey, who died in October.
Wynton said, ``He said, `Music washes the dust of everyday life
from your feet.'''

<TEXT>
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf, said Thursday American troops could
destroy Iraq but such action might not be ``in the interest of the
long-term balance of power'' in the region.
   Schwarzkopf, who assumed command of more than 210,000 American
troops in Saudi Arabia in August, said war could erupt any time,
but he doesn't expect it to.
   ``President Bush has stated again and again, our argument is not
with the Iraqi people, and that (military action) would cause
thousands and thousands of innocent casualties.''
   In an interview published Friday by The New York Times,
Schwarzkopf said he recommended to the Pentagon that combat units
in Saudi Arabia be rotated out of the country every six to eight
months.
   He said Iraqi missiles would have only a modest effect on any
military action because they are highly inaccurate and because the
Iraqis have a relatively small number of rocket launchers.
   Schwarzkopf played down Iraq's ability to mount chemical
warheads on its missiles.

<HEAD>Cuomo: No Presidential Run if State Fiscal Problems Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo says that if he is
re-elected and can't put New York's fiscal house in order, there's
no sense in even discussing a possible 1992 presidential bid.
   ``That's what I have to get done. That's what I ran for,'' Cuomo
said Wednesday of his current re-election bid and dealings with New
York's sagging economy.
   ``There's no way you could say, `No, that's not really
important. I'll solve the problems from Washington,' and then take
off and campaign from coast to coast,'' Cuomo added. ``I couldn't
do it and I wouldn't do it.''
   And if the state's fiscal problems are under control by the time
the 1992 presidential campaign began?
   ``Then you talk to me,'' he said, leaving open the possibility
of a presidential run.
   Cuomo's comments came as he answered speculation from political
analysts that a solid re-election win next week could set the stage
for a presidential campaign.
   National Republican political strategists have said Cuomo's
fiscal record in New York would be a major issue if he ran for
president. During Cuomo's almost eight years as governor, state
spending has grown at more than twice the rate of inflation.
   In his bid for a third term, Cuomo has come under constant
attack from Republicans who claim he's largely responsible for the
state's budget woes. They've compared him to Michael Dukakis,
Massachusetts' lame-duck governor and unsuccessful 1988 Democratic
presidential candidate.
   The collapse of the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' was in large part
responsible for Dukakis' decision not to seek re-election.
   Cuomo, in turn, has sought to blame Presidents Reagan and Bush
and the Republican leadership of the state Senate for New York's
continued fiscal problems.
   ``My sense is that Cuomo will be a candidate (for the
presidency),'' Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist College Institute
for Public Opinion, said Wednesday.
   ``He'll be under more pressure than he's ever been under before,
the morning after the election,'' said Robert Strauss, a former
Democratic national chairman and veteran party power broker. ``He
doesn't like that kind of pressure, but he's going to get it
whether he likes it or not.''
   Cuomo responded by saying that ``if you don't feel it, it's not
pressure. Nobody can pressure you to make a decision like that and
nobody's going to.''
   According to the latest polling, Cuomo is a heavy favorite to
win re-election Tuesday to a third, four-year term as governor. His
opponents are Republican Pierre Rinfret and Conservative Party
candidate Herbert London.

<HEAD>Peru's President Attacks Catholic Church on Birth Control Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his sharpest attack on the Catholic Church,
President Alberto Fujimori has accused the church of controlling
minds and obstructing freedom by refusing to support a planned
birth control program for the poor.
   ``A sector of the church is restricting the freedom of citizens
with its medieval opinions and recalcitrant positions,'' Fujimori
said Wednesday.
   ``It is unethical to manipulate consciences and sow fear and
doubt among the population.''
   The government ``wants the use of contraceptives to be the free
choice of citizens,'' Fujimori told a national mayors' convention
in the coastal town of Huaral, 40 miles north of Lima.
   A planned birth control program was announced last week for this
overwhelmingly Catholic nation. If it is not put into effect,
Fujimori said, Peru's population of 22 million would reach 30
million by the turn of the century.
   The program would distribute free condoms and birth control
pills to the poor. Eight million people, more than one-third of the
population, live in extreme poverty, and families of 10 or more
children are not uncommon.
   Fujimori, a self-professed devout Catholic and political
independent who took office July 28, said the government would not
make birth control compulsory for anyone but stressed that the
population should be informed.
   He criticized the Catholic Church for not supporting the
government's program to encourage people to have only the number of
children they can feed.
   ``There is nothing terrible about not wanting children to eat
garbage in the streets,'' Fujimori said. ``The church won't lose
any authority by admitting there's something wrong, on the
contrary, it will gain.''
   The president angered church officials Oct. 23 when he announced
plans to launch a birth control program among the poorer sectors.
Church leaders are influential among the 95 percent of the
population that is Catholic.
   The government's aim, he said, was to cut the present annual
population growth rate from 650,000 to 300,000 by the year 2000.
   Peru is in the grips of its worst economic crisis in history and
a 13-month-old drought that has badly hurt agricultural production.
   Peru's educational system, which is heavily influenced by the
powerful Catholic Church, does not provide sex education in
schools. However, contraceptives like the birth control pill are
freely available without a prescription in pharmacies.
   The church, represented by Bishop Ricardo Durand, has echoed the
anti-birth control message of Pope John Paul II, who last visited
Peru in 1988.
   ``From the church's point of view, there must responsible
paternity,'' Durand said in a radio interview Friday. But he ruled
out any means of birth control except for natural methods.
   ``Let the people's conscience decide,'' he said in a television
interview Sunday. ``But they must answer to it up above later on.''

<TEXT>
   Louisiana will elect its first black
congressman since Reconstruction in Tuesday's election, following a
campaign marred by bitter personal barbs.
   Marc Morial and state Sen. William Jefferson, both Democrats and
both lawyers, want to replace Rep. Lindy Boggs, an extremely
popular congresswoman who is retiring after 17 years in the House.
   Allegations about Jefferson's personal gain from political
contacts and Morial's fathering a child out of wedlock have
sometimes overshadowed other issues.
   Jefferson and Morial, the son of New Orleans' first black mayor,
were the top vote-getters in the 12-way primary Oct. 6. Jefferson
led with 24 percent, while Morial garnered 22 percent.
   Having virtually split the black vote in the primary, both
candidates need white support to win Tuesday.
   There have been no recent independent polls released, but
University of New Orleans political science professor and
researcher Susan Howell said white voters appear to be largely
undecided.
   ``It's really up for grabs,'' Howell said of the white vote.
   Early in his career, Jefferson enjoyed strong support from
conservatives and business interests - which could translate into
white support at the polls. But that support appeared to diminish
as he fought Gov. Buddy Roemer's fiscal programs and other
initiatives important to the reform-minded governor.
   Morial still is virtually an unknown quantity among whites -
although his father, the late Mayor Dutch Morial, had a strong
coalition of white and black support.
   Morial, 31, has leveled charges that Jefferson's law practice
has benefited from his political contacts.
   ``My law firm built its practice, not on public contracts, but
by serving individuals,'' Morial said at a forum of business
leaders.
   Jefferson, 43, responds by criticizing Morial's lack of
experience.
   ``If you don't do anything in life, you won't get any
criticism,'' Jefferson said. ``If you do, you will.''
   Jefferson, born to a poor family in northern Louisiana,
graduated from Southern University in 1969 and Harvard Law School
in 1972. He clerked for a federal judge in the early 1970s, later
joining the staff of U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
   He set up a New Orleans law practice in 1976 and was elected to
the state Senate in 1979.
   Jefferson has battled Roemer on several matters, including the
governor's call to abolish four state boards that govern higher
education in Louisiana and replace them with one board.
   The plan would do away with predominantly black Southern
University's Board of Supervisors. The board opposes the plan.
   Jefferson is the board's lawyer - a job reportedly worth up to
$195,000 annually.
   Morial calls that a conflict of interest, saying it's only part
of a reported $590,000 in public contracts Jefferson has from
various public agencies.
   A graduate of Georgetown University Law Center, Morial
established a law practice in 1985.
   He, too, has at least one public contract, acting as legal
counsel for the Orleans Parish Civil Sheriff's Office.
   That hasn't become a campaign issue. However, the fact that he
fathered a child eight years ago while a law student has.
   The story broke just after the primary election. Jefferson
denies having anything to do with the publicity surrounding the
matter.
   The child's mother, an attorney who now is married and lives in
Africa, filed suit two days before the primary and later was quoted
as saying she never sought or received a penny in child support
from Morial.
   Morial said he has met all financial and moral obligations.
   Jefferson's campaign plays up the fact that Jefferson has been
married for 20 years and that he and his wife have five children.
   It is not, Jefferson said, an effort to paint Morial as an
irresponsible bachelor father. Rather, he said, it is to show that
he has empathy with families trying to survive in Louisiana's poor
economy.
   ``My only point in bringing it up is to make sure that the
voters out there know that I appreciate their problems,'' Jefferson
said during a recent forum before the New Orleans Young Leadership
Council.
   ``I grew up in a family,'' Morial countered, drawing laughter
and brief applause from his supporters in the audience.

<HEAD>Backer of Drug Legalization Gets Rude Welcome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug legalization advocate Anthony Henman got
a rude welcome when he arrived in the United States to attend a
conference: 20 hours in custody and three strip searches.
   A federal arrest warrant for Henman popped up when an
immigration officer at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport punched his name into a computer, said Immigration and
Naturalization Service spokesman Farrell Adams.
   The INS detained the British citizen at 5 p.m. on Oct. 25 and
turned him over to the U.S. Marshals Service, Adams said.
   The trouble was, the warrant wasn't valid.
   The 1972 indictment stemmed from an accused drug dealer's
allegations that Henman had been his supplier, according to
attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and its New York
branch.
   ``The indictment was later dropped, but the arrest warrant
wasn't,'' said Phil Gutis of the ACLU. ``This was the first time
Henman has come into the country since then.''
   It took until mid-afternoon of Oct. 26 for Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ira Belkin in the Eastern District of New York to discover
that the indictment had been dismissed in 1981.
   ``For whatever reason, that information never made its way into
the computer,'' Belkin said. ``The warrant, as far as the computer
was concerned, was still in there. Basically, it was a mistake. As
soon as we figured that out, he was released.''
   Henman is the executive secretary of the Brussels-based
International Anti-Prohibitionist League. He traveled to the United
States to attend a conference organized by the Washington-based
Drug Policy Foundation, which advocates drug decriminalization.
   ``He was held incommunicado for 20 hours - which, unfortunately,
isn't that unusual - and he was strip-searched three times,'' said
Gutis. ``When he was able to contact a lawyer, he got hold of the
New York Civil Liberties Union and they were able to clear up the
situation rather quickly.''
   Henman's lawyers say they may sue.
   ``Mr. Henman indicated there were lots of apologies after the
fact, but the apologies cannot really undo the profound harm,''
said Donna Lieberman, associate director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``The computer ... was dead wrong, and as a result, an innocent
person was subjected to deprivation of his liberty in violation of
his fundamental rights.''

<HEAD>Budget Has Medicaid Aid for Holocaust Survivors, Other Hidden
Items</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Medicaid break for Holocaust survivors, an
award named for a member of Congress and a promise by Democratic
leaders of billions in new spending for minorities are all tucked
into the deficit-reduction bill.
   The provisions are among numerous obscure items in the budget
that are only now coming to light, days after Congress approved the
measure and adjourned for the year.
   Other language provides assistance for Americans fleeing Iraq
and Kuwait and money for certain centers to treat patients with
Alzheimer's disease or those who may have AIDS.
   But in a money-saving move, lawmakers decreed that deceased
veterans using federal burial benefits no longer would be able to
receive free headstones from the government.
   It is a longstanding Washington tradition for giant measures
like the deficit-reduction package to be crammed with items that
affect limited numbers of people.
   In fact, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., is offering dinner for two at
a Capitol Hill restaurant for anyone who brings one to his
attention that benefits five or fewer people. He has yet to find
one.
   ``Staff tells me this is the cleanest bill they've seen in
recent times,'' Weldon said Wednesday.
   But the bill - the main part of an effort to slash the federal
deficit by $496 billion over the next five years - does contain
provisions that benefit specific groups or areas.
   A report accompanying the bill contains an unusual promise by
Democratic congressional leaders to try to increase federal
spending for minority group members by at least $8.8 billion over
the next three years.
   The leaders promise an effort to target science and energy
research and education initiatives to traditionally black and
Hispanic colleges and universities. They say they will try to set
up a new federally backed bond program for new construction at the
schools, of which there are about 120, mostly in the South.
   The Democrats also say they will try to increase spending on
foreign aid to Africa, housing, urban development, education,
health, child care and anti-gang programs in inner cities, welfare,
job training and veterans.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Tuesday the
language had nothing to do with the hunt Democratic leaders made
last week for support for the budget, which the House approved
228-200.
   ``A number of our members, black and white, felt we wanted to
make investments in certain areas,'' he said.
   But Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., one of 24 House Democrats in the
Congressional Black Caucus, said the provision was included after
negotiations between black lawmakers and House leaders. Much of it
came from the budget the caucus proposed earlier this year, he
said.
   ``Most of us wanted to find a way to support the Democratic
leadership'' and vote for the budget, Wheat said Wednesday.
   Ten of the black caucus' members voted for the bill and 13 voted
against it. Walter Fauntroy, the delegate from Washington D.C., has
no vote on the House floor.
   In another section of the bill, Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., inserted
language that allows Holocaust survivors to ignore reparation
payments they receive from Germany when it comes to determining
Medicaid nursing home benefits.
   The provision is expected to affect 300 low-income, elderly
people who survived Hitler's death camps and who each receive an
average of $1,600 annually from the German government. They would
no longer have their federal nursing home benefits reduced by the
amount of those checks, a provision likely to cost the government
about $500,000 per year.
   Another clause creates the Walter B. Jones Excellence in Coastal
Management awards. The prizes of up to $5,000 will be given to
individuals, local governments and graduate students for protecting
coastal lands.
   The award is named for Rep. Walter B. Jones, D-N.C., chairman of
the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
   The bill also:
   -Extends the life of 10 special projects where Medicare money is
being used to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease. Only eight
of the facilities have been financed so far, in Rochester, N.Y.;
Urbana, Ill.; Memphis, Tenn.; Portland, Ore.; Cincinnati, Ohio;
Parkersburg, W.Va.; Minneapolis and Miami.
   -Contains $30 million for Medicare for two new centers -
expected by congressional officials to be in New York and San
Francisco - to treat people infected with the AIDS virus and
pregnant women believed to be at risk of getting the virus.
   -Allows the government to spend whatever amount is necessary to
provide temporary aid to Americans escaping from Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.

<HEAD>Economic Slowdown Reported in All Regions of Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All regions of the country are reporting
either slow growth or an actual decline in economic activity, the
Federal Reserve Board says.
   The bleak assessment in a central bank report known as the
``beige book'' offered a contrast Wednesday with the bit of
optimism generated a day earlier by a separate report.
   The Commerce Department had reported that the economy, as
measured by the gross national product, grew a
stronger-than-expected 1.8 percent in the July-September quarter.
   However, the Federal Reserve said a survey of its 12 district
banks found that higher oil prices are shaking the confidence of
consumers and businesses in much of the country.
   ``Most districts reported that retailers were generally
pessimistic. ... (They) blamed lower consumer confidence brought on
by greater uncertainty and higher fuel prices,'' the central bank
reported.
   District Federal Reserve banks said economic activity was
holding up relatively well in the Midwest and Northwest, but the
Boston district reported, ``Manufacturers are battening down the
hatches.''
   The report, based on information collected through Oct. 19, was
prepared for the Nov. 13 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, which sets the Fed's monetary policy.
   In response to enactment of the budget deficit-reduction
package, the central bank on Monday lowered a key interest rate,
the one charged among banks for overnight loans, by a quarter of a
percentage point to 7.75 percent.
   However, economists believe Fed policymakers will be reluctant
to cut the rate again soon for fear of further weakening the value
of the dollar or adding to inflation pressures already boosted by
higher oil prices.
   ``The beige book shows ... the process of gradually slipping
into a recession, but the tone wasn't urgent enough to cause the
Fed to ease policy right away,'' said economist David Jones of
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in New
York.
   The survey found pessimism even in relatively strong regions.
The San Francisco district, for instance, said 67 percent of the
area's business leaders expect a national recession next year.
   ``Several districts reported that some financial institutions
had tightened their lending standards, especially for real estate
loans, because of uncertain economic prospects,'' the report said.
   In a sign of slipping confidence in the banking system, the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank said institutional investors -
pension funds, insurance companies, universities and the like -
were less interested in depositing uninsured funds with banks.
   Most areas reported some fallout from oil prices, which rocketed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. The St. Louis regional
bank said fuel prices caused airline layoffs and contributed to the
cancellation of expansion plans by a trucking firm.
   The San Francisco region said one of its respondents reported
the addition of a fuel surcharge to shipment costs and the Dallas
district said food processors were raising their prices to cover
increased transportation costs.
   On the positive side, the Dallas district said orders for oil
field machinery were up. Applications for oil well permits have
risen in both Texas and Louisiana, it said.
   The other bright spot in the report was agriculture. Yields of
most crops were expected to be good. The Minneapolis and Kansas
City districts reported that higher livestock prices and low feed
costs were helping to support farm income.

<HEAD>Farm Production Costs at Eight-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm production costs are rising at the
fastest clip in eight years because of higher oil prices caused by
the Mideast crisis, according to the Agriculture Department.
   The surge in costs of producing crops and livestock is expected
to bite into farmers' income prospects in 1991.
   New quarterly figures through October showed farm expenses
jumped an average of 2.2 percent from July, when such figures were
last available. The expense index was up 5.6 percent from October
1989.
   ``A sharp rise in fuel prices since July contributed most to the
largest quarterly index increase since January 1982,'' said a
report released Wednesday.
   The monthly report by the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board said prices farmers get for raw products declined 0.7 percent
from September to October but still averaged 1.4 percent more than
a year ago.
   ``Decreases in the prices of broilers, milk, corn and apples
were partially offset by higher prices for hogs, tomatoes,
strawberries and eggs,'' the board said in its preliminary report.
   Prices of most food and feed grains were down from September,
although higher prices were reported for oats, rice and durum
wheat. Soybean and sunflower prices declined, while peanut prices
increased.
   ``The October all-hog price increased moderately over September,
while the all-cattle price was up slightly,'' the report said.
   Prices of steers and heifers sold as beef were at a record high
for October, the report said. But broiler prices dropped sharply
from September, partly due to large supplies and weaker seasonal
demand.
   USDA economists say consumer food prices will rise an average of
5 percent to 7 percent this year, compared with a 5.8 percent gain
in 1989, the most since 1981. There has been no official forecast
for 1991.
   The net cash income of farmers in 1990 has been forecast at a
record in the range of $59 billion to $63 billion, up about 10
percent from last year. The previous high was $57.2 billion in
1988.
   Net cash income is the amount nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income in a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method of agency accounting, which includes changes
in inventories, depreciation and other allowances during the year,
1990 net farm income may be in the range of $47 billion to $52
billion, compared with $47 billion last year.
   The Agriculture Department's first 1991 forecasts for food
prices and farm income are scheduled to be released during an
annual outlook conference here in late November.
   Based on preliminary figures that could be revised next month,
the October price index for all crops was down 1.6 percent from
September and averaged 4.7 percent less than a year earlier.
   The October index for livestock and products was down 1.2
percent from September but still averaged 5.6 percent more than in
October 1989.
   Milk prices, reflecting stepped-up production, dropped 60 cents
from September to an October average of $13.60 per 100 pounds. The
October price was down $1.20 from a year earlier.
   The all-fruit price index in October was down 6.4 percent from
September and 8.7 percent the October 1989 average. Lower prices
for apples, oranges and grapefruit were mostly responsible for the
decline from September.
   The report also said:
   -Cattle averaged $75.10 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up 10 cents from September. A year earlier, cattle
averaged $68.70 per hundredweight. Those are averages for all types
of cattle sold as beef.
   -Hogs averaged $56.90 per hundredweight, up from $54.30 in
September and $46.60 a year earlier.
   -Corn, at $2.15 per bushel, was down from $2.32 in September and
$2.22 a year earlier.
   -Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.39 per bushel, compared with $2.46 in September and
$3.75 in October 1989.
   -Rice averaged $6.34 per 100 pounds, against $6.25 in September
and $7.37 a year earlier.
   -Soybeans were $5.90 per bushel, compared with $5.99 in
September and $5.54 in October 1989.
   -Upland cotton was reported at 66.9 cents per pound, compared
with 65 cents in September and 65.8 cents a year earlier.
   -Eggs were 73.5 cents per dozen, compared with 68.5 cents in
September and 71.6 cents a year earlier.
   -Milk was $13.60 per hundredweight, against $14.20 in September
and $14.80 in October 1989.
   -Broilers were 29 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
35.2 cents in September and 30.2 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>472 Rich Americans Paid No Tax in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not as easy as it used to be, but it's
still possible to make $200,000 a year and avoid paying any federal
income tax.
   In fact, 472 couples and individuals with incomes averaging
$447,000 ``zeroed out'' on returns filed in 1988, the Internal
Revenue Service says. That was down from 595 who paid no tax the
previous year.
   In a report released Wednesday, the IRS said 557,848 returns
showed income of $200,000 or better, making those people among the
highest-earning 0.5 percent. In addition to those who paid no tax,
9,300 high-income people paid less than 5 percent while 17,082 paid
under 10 percent - about the same as paid by the average
$35,000-a-year family.
   The report, required annually by Congress, said 149 of the 472
used itemized deductions to wipe out their tax liability. Others
relied on losses from farm, business and partnership operations.
   In contrast, only 76 of the well-to-do who paid no taxes
reported losses on the sale of investments. Those capital losses
averaged only $2,600. The IRS said 273 reported capital gains -
profits from investment sales - that averaged more than $384,000.
   The analysis is based on raw tax returns. IRS audits could
result in assessments that would move some of the couples and
individuals out of the non-taxpaying category.
   The report said a special levy, called the alternative minimum
tax, made taxpayers out of 3,396 high-income people who otherwise
would have gotten off scot-free.
   This levy, designed to ensure that high earners pay some tax
regardless of how many legitimate deductions they have, hit 35,223
people in the over-$200,000 group for a total of $1 billion.
However, the alternative tax does not apply in all cases.
   Because capital gains now are taxed in the same fashion as
ordinary income - eliminating capital gains as a tax-avoidance
device - the take from the minimum tax was down sharply compared
with returns filed in 1987. For that year, the minimum tax produced
$4.8 billion from 158.903 high-income filers.
   Under orders from Congress, the IRS has been reporting the tax
situation of upper-income Americans since 1977. In that year, there
were 53 returns reporting income of $200,000 or more while paying
no taxes.
   Although the law has been changed several times in an effort to
prevent the well-to-do from shielding their income, the figure grew
to 613 on returns filed in 1986. Analysts say anti-tax-shelter
rules enacted in 1986 will continue to reduce the number.
   Through the years, the number of tax-free rich people has been
only a tiny fraction of the wealthy. The new IRS report showed the
557,848 taxpayers in the $200,000-and-over group paid a total $72.7
billion, an average of $130,276 apiece.
   Here are some of the income and deduction items reported by the
472 who paid no tax:
   -381 claimed itemized deductions totaling $161 million, an
average $423,000.
   -179 claimed business losses totaling $22 million while 71
listed business profits of $14 million.
   -Farm losses of $12 million were reported on 29 returns; only
four reported farm profits, totaling $137,000.
   -Partnership losses of $123 million were shown on 256 untaxed
returns. On the other hand, 73 reported partnership profits of $23
million.
   -436 received interest totaling $95 million. More than half of
that was from tax-exempt investments.
   -322 had dividends, totaling $29 million.
   -Only 40 reported receiving pension payments, worth under $2
million.
   -55 had taxable Social Security benefits worth $305,000.
   -Alimony receipts were reported on only one return; they totaled
$8,000.
   -Deductions for interest paid averaged $135,000; for medical
expenses $186,000; for casualty losses, $405,000; for state and
local taxes, $33,000; for charitable contributions, $87,000.
   Nearly 2,700 people with income over $200,000 received
unemployment compensation during the year. Two of them paid no tax.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Dr. George Nichopoulous, Elvis Presley's
personal physician for 11 years, discounts the claim of Presley
biographer Albert Goldman that the King committed suicide.
   In his first interview since the King's death in 1977,
Nichopoulos said on the syndicated TV program ``A Current Affair''
that Presley's death may have been caused by the pressures of
stardom or psychological problems.
   But he said, ``I don't think Elvis was capable of committing
suicide. ... (He) had many opportunities to commit suicide at much
more stressful times.''
   In 1981, Nichopoulos was acquitted of prescribing excessive
amounts of narcotics to Presley and eight other patients. He was
accused of prescribing more than 10,000 doses of drugs during the
18 months before Presley's death.
   The interview will air next week.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Cybill Shepherd says movie studios are
afraid to make a film about racism.
   ``Prejudice is ever present. It's just uncomfortable. People
don't want to recognize it in themselves,'' the ``Moonlighting''
actress said Wednesday while promoting the TV movie ``Memphis,''
which airs next year.
   The movie is about the kidnapping of the grandson of a wealthy
black businessman from Memphis in the 1950s. Ms. Shepherd plays a
kidnapper who develops a maternal bond with the child.
   A Memphis native, Ms. Shepherd is one of the film's producers
and helped write the script based on Shelby Foote's novel
``September, September.''
   Ms. Shepherd said she began working in 1981 on the screenplay
and looked for several years for a studio interested in making the
movie, which Turner Network Television recently decided to back.

   APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) - Cowboy star Roy Rogers is the

he is recovering from heart surgery, his son says.
   The 78-year-old actor, who appeared in 87 Westerns, probably
will be released from St. Mary Desert Hospital this week, Roy
``Dusty'' Rogers Jr. said Wednesday.
   ``He's the terror of the hallways from what I understand. He's
walking from room to room and going as far as he can go,'' he said.
   Rogers turns 79 on Monday, and the family usually holds one
party for him, his wife, Dale Evans, who turned 78 Wednesday, and
Dusty, who was 44 on Sunday.
   ``Dad was saying, `It's mom's birthday, I've got to go out and
get her something.' I told him, `There ain't no way you're going to
do it this year,''' Roy Jr. said.
   Rogers underwent a four-hour operation last month in which
doctors replaced a weak spot in his aorta with a graft of Dacron.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) - The red carpet has faded for Saudi
Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz.
   The prince has been stripped of a security detail made up of
off-duty police officers from Harvard University.
   Harvard Vice President Daniel Steiner ordered an end to the
guard detail, which reportedly earned officers at least $27,000 a
week, to avoid the perception that it compromises routine police
work.
   ``We had tried to be helpful to Prince Turki, and I think it
went on longer than either he or we expected,'' Steiner said
Tuesday. ``Our mission is providing security for Harvard.''
   The prince has paid Harvard and Cambridge police to protect his
entourage of 65 bunked in the top two floors of the Charles Hotel
since their arrival in August.
   Turki, the fourth in line to the Saudi throne, at first received
a royal welcome.
   But Cambridge residents have complained that his bodyguards
kicked children out of a playground, and two photographers from the
Harvard Crimson said they were threatened by royal bodyguards.

<HEAD>Experts Say Gulf War Could Triple Oil Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War in the Persian Gulf would send a shock
wave through world oil markets aimed directly at the wallets of
consumers, petroleum industry officials say.
   ``The day the war starts, prices will explode,'' John Lichtblau
of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday, and ``there is no
limit'' to how high prices could ise. Short of quickly winning a
war against Iraq, he added, there is little the United States could
do to control prices.
   Oil prices hovering in the $33 per barrel range could easily
triple, said Professor Fariborz Ghadar of George Washington
University's business school. ``I would not be surprised if oil
prices reached $100 per barrel,'' he said.
   Translating a crude oil price increase into a higher price at
the pump is an inexact science. But some industry experts use a
ratio of 12 cents more per gallon for every $5 increase in the
price of crude.
   At $100 per barrel, under that formula, gasoline could rise to
nearly $3 per gallon at the pump.
   The reasons for the sharp price rise, the experts said, would be
fear that war would disrupt supply lines, combined with the
likelihood that a gulf war would curtail Saudi Arabia's
oil-producing capabilities.
   With oil production already at or near capacity, oil-consuming
states could do little beyond release oil reserves onto the market,
the witnesses said.
   Conversely, they said, if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
suddenly ends the crisis by withdrawing his forces from Kuwait, the
price of oil could drop just as suddenly to levels below those that
preceded the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``That range is likely to be reached approximately 48 hours
after the crisis is over,'' Lichtblau said.
   If the stalemate continues, it is likely that oil prices will
remain about where they are, the witnesses said, but they could
jump quickly with any disruption of a supply system already
straining to meet demand.
   ``This is a very tight market,'' Ghadar said. ``A pipe blowing
up in Nigeria, a fire in Venezuela, some other disruption,'' could
be enough to spread panic and push prices higher.
   The witnesses said there was little the United States could do
to break up the oil cartel and that meantime, the simple laws of
supply and demand would govern the price of oil.
   Witnesses rejected as unworkable, for example, a suggestion by
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that Saudi Arabia unilaterally
lower the price of its crude in exchange for U.S. military support.
The market would quickly absorb the cheap Saudi oil and no other
countries would be compelled to lower their prices, Lichtblau said.
   The best the United States could hope for is more money from
Saudi Arabia to help pay the cost of Operation Desert Shield, he
said.

<TEXT>
   Nine environmental and consumer groups are
launching a campaign to convince Americans that Detroit automakers,
not Saddam Hussein, are the reason U.S. troops are in the Middle
East.
   The Coalition for Fuel Efficient Transportation is asking
newspapers, television and radio stations to run free commercials
with the message that the United States is on the brink of war over
oil.
   ``This is Detroit's war, not the public's war,'' Jeremy Rifkin,
president of a group called the Center for Sustainable
Transportation, said Wednesday. ``If we begin conserving energy at
home, we won't have to risk American lives in the Middle East.''
   The coalition will sponsor advertisements in major newspapers,
beginning with a $25,000 half-page ad in Friday editions of The New
York Times, Rifkin said. It is asking radio and TV stations to run
its commercials as public-service announcements, and some already
have done so, he said.
   The campaign is designed to rekindle the battle over automobile
fuel efficiency, Rifkin said. It faded in September, when opponents
beat back efforts to force a Senate vote on a bill sponsored by
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., to require new cars to average 40 miles
per gallon by the turn of the century.
   The commercials urge Congress and the Bush administration to
raise government fuel efficiency standards and boost the federal
tax on gas-guzzling automobiles.
   U.S. oil imports have risen over the past 15 years although fuel
efficiency has improved 100 percent, said Tom Hanna, president of
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
   ``Casting this business in the Middle East as a failure of U.S.
energy policy is a rather mean-spirited interpretation of the
president's actions,'' he said.
   In addition to Rifkin's groups, members of the coalition include
the U.S Public Interest Research Group, the American Council for an
Energy Efficiency Economy, the Center for Auto Safety, Citizen
Action, Environmental Action, the National Toxics Campaign, Public
Citizen and the Safe Energy Communications Council.

<HEAD>Report Sees Millions Denied Care as Health Costs Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the next decade, millions more Americans
will be shut out of the health care system unless the federal
government acts to prevent a national catastrophe, two social
activist groups said.
   With the nation's health care costs expected to soar from $606
billion this year to $1.5 trillion by the turn of the century,
America's quality of life is on the line, said Robert Brandon, vice
president of Citizen Action.
   ``Increasingly, health care is becoming a luxury item that fewer
and fewer individuals and families will be able to afford,''
Brandon said. ``The already frayed safety net will be in shreds by
the end of the decade.''
   A report by Citizen Action and Families USA Foundation, released
Wednesday, projected meteoric rises in health care costs that it
said would harm American businesses and hurt their competitiveness
with foreign companies. Americans, too, would have to spend larger
portions of their income on medical care and insurance, the report
said.
   ``We've got to do something to get health care costs under
control or health care is going to be unaffordable for millions of
Americans,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA
Foundation.
   ``Unless the United States takes bold action now to curb health
care costs, the explosion of health care costs will mean a
declining standard of health care and a declining standard of
living,'' he said.
   The report does not recommend any specific solutions to the
problem of rising costs, but at a news conference Pollack said,
``This is a national problem. ... Ultimately we need a national
system.''
   Pollack and Brandon blamed the rising costs on a variety of
factors, including insurance companies' inefficiencies, escalating
fees for doctors and hospitals and uncoordinated use of expensive,
sophisticated technology.
   The report, which lists state-by-state health care spending,
identified Massachusetts as the largest per-capita spender. There,
state and federal governments, residents, employers and other
private sources will pay an estimated $3,031 for every man, woman
and child in the state this year.
   The national average is estimated to be $2,425 this year, rising
to $5,515 by the year 2000, according to the report. It based the
estimates on 1987 Medicare and Medicaid data, changing demographics
and a model of how those demographics will change health-care
spending within states.
   The estimates are also based on state spending figures compiled
by the Health Care Financing Administration in 1982, the last year
the federal agency developed state figures.
   California was second to Massachusetts in health care spending,
at $2,894 per capita, followed by New York, $2,818; Nevada, $2,757;
Rhode Island, $2,707; Connecticut, $2,699; and North Dakota,
$2,661, according to the report.
   By the turn of the century, per capita health care spending in
these states will be more than $6,000, the report said.
   The lowest levels of per capita spending were in South Carolina,
$1,689; Idaho, $1,726; Mississippi, $1,751; Wyoming, $1,756; and
Utah, $1,784.
   In 10 years, these states will be spending nearly $4,000 per
capita, according to the projections.
   Per capita spending over the 20 years from 1980 to 2000 is
expected to grow fastest in Arizona, Alaska, New Mexico, Florida,
Maine, North Dakota and Washington state, according to the report.
   Families USA Foundation is a nonprofit group working on behalf
of low- and middle-income senior citizens and their families.
   Citizen Action is a national grassroots citizens' organization

   The campaign in a General Assembly race is
sounding more like a sermon filled with hellfire and brimstone.
   The Democratic incumbent, state Rep. Lynn Taborsak, is under
attack for proposing legislation earlier this year encouraging
young people to masturbate to avoid sexually transmitted diseases
and unwanted pregnancies.
   ``The Bible says cast your seed into the belly of a whore rather
than onto the ground,'' Republican candidate Alex Nahas said
recently, referring to the character Onan in the book of Genesis
whose name has become synonymous with masturbation.
   ``It violates every religious principle in the Bible,'' said
Nahas, who believes sex education should be reserved for the home.
   Taborsak's measure, which was circulated in the House but never
formally introduced or debated, called on young people to practice
masturbation until they are ready for marriage.
   Taborsak says she only introduced the measure to derail a
Republican amendment requiring that students be taught abstinence
from premarital sex as the ``expected norm.''

<HEAD>Bush Expected To Sign Bill on TV Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation giving the television industry a
three-year antitrust exemption to adopt voluntary guidelines on
violence in programming is awaiting President Bush's signature.
   The House and Senate included the provision in a bill on the
federal judiciary passed during the waning hours of the 101st
Congress.
   Bush is expected to sign the measure, according to an aide to
Sen. Paul Simon.
   The Illinois Democrat, who has been trying to get such
legislation passed since 1985, has cited studies that show by age
16, the average American child has seen 200,000 acts of violence on
television, including 33,000 murders.
   Simon said the bill could help ``scale back the atmosphere of
violence'' on television.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has attacked the bill as
being a ``Trojan Horse'' that could lead to censorship of TV
programming.
   But Simon and the bill's House author, Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., said the bill merely gives the TV industry an easy way to
lower the level of violence without losing audiences to
more-violent competitors and without violating antitrust laws.
   ``Each network is reluctant to take unilateral steps to reduce
violent programming for fear of slipping in the ratings,'' Glickman
said. ``The bill in no way attempts to dictate programming
policy.''
   Simon's bill had passed the Senate and House in previous
sessions, but never had gotten to the president's desk.

<HEAD>Accused Terrorist Turned Over to Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it has turned
Mahmoud Atta over to Israeli authorities to face terrorism charges.
   Atta, who also uses the name Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad, was placed
in Israeli custody and immediately taken out of the United States,
spokesman Adam Shub said Wednesday.
   The imminence of the transfer and threats from a terrorist group
to act if it were carried out prompted the department to issue an
unusual alert last Friday warning that terrorists might be panning
an attack on passenger ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
   The department said then it had ``specific and credible''
information about such an attack that ``may be undertaken at any
time.''
   Wednesday evening, Shub said he had nothing to add to the alert.
   Atta, 37 and a U.S. citizen, has been accused of taking part in
the 1986 machine gun attack on a bus carrying Jewish settlers in
the occupied West Bank. The driver was killed and a passenger
wounded.
   He was arrested in the United States three years ago. On Aug.
31, the Supreme Court rejected his last appeal in a court battle to
avoid extradition.
   The Abu Nidal Organization, a terrorist group of which Atta was
a member, has threatened ``to attack U.S. interests'' if Atta were
extradited, the department said.

<HEAD>`White House Connection' Gets 10 Years on Cocaine Sale Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school senior accused of selling the
crack cocaine President Bush used as a prop in an anti-drug speech
was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his conviction of three
counts of selling cocaine.
   Keith Jackson, 19, was arrested last September after being lured
by Drug Enforcement Administration agents to Lafayette Square,
across the street from the White House.
   The DEA set up the alleged drug sale in Lafayette Square to
dramatize how easy it is to buy drugs in the nation's capital.
   Two juries deadlocked on that charge, once in December 1989 and
again last January. But the January jury convicted Jackson of three
counts of distributing drugs in other locations before the
Lafayette Square sale, including a count of selling crack within
1,000 feet of a school. That crime carries an automatic 10-year
sentence.
   The same jury acquitted Jackson of using a telephone to further
a narcotics deal.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin on Wednesday told Jackson,
who had no prior criminal record, that he regretted having to
impose the sentence of 10 years without parole. He urged Jackson to
ask Bush for a commutation.
   ``He used you, in the sense of making a big drug speech. But
he's a decent man, a man of great compassion. Maybe he can find a
way to reduce at least some of that sentence,'' said Sporkin, the
former CIA general counsel appointed to the bench by President
Reagan in 1986.
   ``You have to realize, you are on the road to getting into very,
very serious trouble. I think you're a nice young man and you have
a future. But I do believe you were out of control for a period of
time,'' Sporkin said.
   Jackson's lawyer, Charles Stow III, said because of his client's
publicity from the Bush speech, the authorities made an example of
him.

<HEAD>Device Capable Of Detecting Plastic Explosives Goes Into Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A device said to be capable of detecting the
kind of plastic explosive that destroyed Pan Am flight 103 is now
being used at Dulles International Airport near Washington.
   James B. Busey, administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Wednesday that the Thermal Neutron Analysis or
TNA device represents a ``significant improvement in performance''
over earlier generations of detection technology.
   ``The machine has the capability of detecting the explosives
that we think were present on Pan Am 103,'' the airliner destroyed
over Scotland two years ago, Busey said.
   The Dulles detector put in service Wednesday is the fourth to be
installed at international airports in an FAA program to test
capabilities and build an enhanced anti-terrorist security system
at airports worldwide.
   Other TNA units are at John F. Kennedy International Airport in
New York, the Miami international airport nd Gatwick Airport near
London.
   Busey said tentative plans call for similar explosive devices to
be installed at airports in Frankfurt, Germany and at the
Baltimore-Washington airport in Maryland.
   Adaption of the TNA device, the only technology now believed
able to detect plastic explosives of the kind that brought down Pan
Am 103, coincides with a report from the National Academy of
Sciences concluding that the FAA is essentially on the right track.

<HEAD>Racial Fears Stirred By Plan to Bring Subway to the Suburbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta's rapid transit system is beckoning to
booming suburban Gwinnett County, but some voters there want to
derail the expansion because of fears that blacks from the city
will stream out on buses and trains.
   Others say they simply don't want to pay for it.
   Gwinnett County voters decide Nov. 6 whether to bring the
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority into the county in
exchange for a 1 percent sales tax.
   County Commissioner W.J. Dodd said his constituents oppose the
idea, and he predicted it would fail.
   ``One of the worst fears is bringing people out of Atlanta, the
minorities,'' he said. Dodd refused to say where he stands on the
expansion.
   Blacks and other minorities make up only 6.4 percent of
Gwinnett's 355,000 residents. Blacks make up 66 percent of
Atlanta's 425,000 people.
   Voters in the northeastern Atlanta suburb rejected mass transit
service in 1971. That same year, Fulton and DeKalb counties - which
make up Atlanta - became the first in the nation to pay voluntarily
for a mass transit system.
   The sales tax they approved has not kept pace with MARTA's
expenses, though. The system in July raised bus and train fares 15
cents to $1 rather than cut service.
   MARTA, the South's first mass transit system, now transports
280,000 bus riders and 220,000 rail passengers daily. The rail line
stretches in four directions from downtown Atlanta to Fulton and
DeKalb suburbs and to Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   Residents of Gwinnett County, whose population has quintupled
since 1971, depend on their cars - 311,000 of them. Traffic is
bumper-to-bumper from Gwinnett into downtown Atlanta most weekdays.
   MARTA officials estimate mass transit could take 25,000 cars off
the county's roads, and ridership in Gwinnett could reach 60,000 by
the year 2010.
   Opponents argue that the masses would finance the expansion but
that only businesses trying to attract low-wage workers would
benefit. The plan's foes have taken their campaign to grocery
stores and malls, handing out Ban MARTA stickers.
   Supporters of the plan have put up signs on Interstate 85 into
Gwinnett County that read, ``Gwinnett's Future is Riding on
MARTA.'' Radio spots tout the benefits of public transportation.
   ``Some people have said they oppose MARTA because they are
concerned about crime and a decrease in their property values,''
said Richard Myrick, a Gwinnett businessman leading the expansion
effort. Myrick and others are trying to assure residents that
public transportation won't ruin their neighborhoods.
   If voters approve, MARTA will spend $681 million to extend a
rail line 10.8 miles toward Gwinnett Place Mall in Duluth. The line
would be completed by 1998.
   Gwinnett County residents would pay a 1 percent sales tax until
the year 2032 and a 1.5 percent sales tax for the next eight years
until the contract expired in 2040. The current sales tax in
Gwinnett County is 5 percent.
   A Gwinnett Daily News poll last month found that 60 percent of
voters surveyed opposed the sales tax. Twenty-six percent of the
500 voters said they would foot the bill; the remainder were
undecided. The newspaper gave no margin of error for the poll.
   Anna Roupe said she would vote against the expansion.
   ``The people of Gwinnett County can't afford it,'' she said.
``As far as I'm concerned, for me, it's my pocketbook. There is no
other issue.''
   Joe Lupton of Snellville said there is another issue for county
residents: crime. ``I would hasten to say they fear for their
lives,'' he said.
   Gwinnett County Commission Chairman Lillian Webb, the only
commissioner who has voiced support for the expansion, lamented
that many people see it as a racial issue.
   ``Some of them have said, ``We don't want those people out
here.' It upsets me. The other races, other ethnic groups
contribute to our cultural diversity,'' she said.

<HEAD>South Bronx Clinic Fighting to Preserve Abortion Counseling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen-year-old Rita Roundtree says she wants
information about abortion if the pregnancy test she took this week
turns out positive.
   But the Planned Parenthood clinic in her blighted South Bronx
neighborhood won't be able to provide such information - either for
or against abortion - if a federal ban on such counseling is upheld
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The clinic's medical director, Dr. Irving Rust, is leading a
battle to overturn the regulation, which was enacted under the
Reagan administration in 1988 but has not been enforced pending
court appeals.
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case, in
which Rust, Planned Parenthood, and the city and state are
challenging the law. A decision is expected in July.
   A federal judge in New York City and a federal appeals court
panel upheld the regulation, but other federal courts around the
country have ruled it an unconstitutional infringement on free
speech.
   The law bans abortion counseling at health clinics that receive
federal funds. Twenty-seven percent of the South Bronx clinic's
funds - about $450,000 a year - come from the government.
   If the law is upheld, said Jeannine Michael, the clinic's
director, Ms. Roundtree could neither be counseled for or against
abortion.
   ``You may have a woman come in and say, `I'm here for an
abortion,' and you don't accept that on face value,'' she said.
``You may find out ... that in fact she has been coerced into
having an abortion that she doesn't want.''
   If she is pregnant, Ms. Roundtree said, she wants advice about
getting an abortion.
   ``To me, by having a baby, would have me get behind,'' said the
young woman, who is looking for a job.
   Another patient, 19-year-old Sharice Jackson, said the clinic
plays a crucial role in the well-being of South Bronx residents.
   ``Without this place, I don't think my generation would have any
other place to go, because, with the way things are going with
teen-age pregnancies, you need a place that you can go to get
options to know what you can do,'' she said.
   The clinic is in one of the country's poorest communities. Its
acres of abandoned and vandalized buildings have become a symbol of
urban decay. Most of its residents are black or Hispanic. Eighty
percent of the students entering the ninth grade in the South Bronx
don't graduate.
   For many of the 6,000 women and teen-agers who visit the clinic
each year it is their only source for a full range of medical
services, including routine gynecological care, prenatal care,
abortion, abortion counseling, AIDS testing and baby care.
   ``(We have been) particularly involved in trying to make sure
that our clients get as much good care as would a woman .. getting
private, expensive medical care,'' Rust said.
   The ban on abortion counseling would put an end to that, he
said. He added that many women whose pregnancies threaten their
lives need to know about the option of abortion.
   ``I get a lot of women who come in with serious medical problems
- anemia, diabetes, high blood pressure,'' he said. ``Sometimes
they come in with emotional problems and a lot of genetic
problems.''

<HEAD>Jew Stabbed By Arab As Violence Continues</HEAD>

   An Arab stabbed a Jewish man several times in
the chest in a Tel Aviv suburb on Thursday in a continuing wave of
violence that began with last's month Temple Mount killings.
   The 48-year-old Israeli Jew was on his way work when he was
stabbed near his home in Rishon Lezion, said district police
spokesman Eli Maimon. He was hospitalized and listed in
satisfactory condition.
   Israel army radio said extra police were deployed at nearby
major junctions to search for the assailant and prevent revenge
attacks by Israelis on Arabs.
   The attack apparently was the latest in a spate of revenge
attacks set off by the police response to an Oct. 8 Palestinian
riot on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Twenty Palestinians were
killed in police gunfire.
   Since then, attacks by both Arabs and Israelis have left six
people dead and more than 10 wounded.
   After last week's revenge attacks, Defense Minister Moshe Arens
closed off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for four days,
barring Palestinians from entering Israel.
   On Monday, Arens announced tougher restrictions for Palestinians
entering Israel from the occupied lands, saying he would ban all
those with records of crime or nationalist political activity.

   In a few years, college-bound students will have
to give their own answers to some Scholastic Aptitude Test math
problems instead of picking from multiple choices. But they'll be
able to use a calculator.
   Those are among changes announced Wednesday by the College
Board, sponsor of the SAT, the most widely used college entrance
exam in the nation.
   The revisions - the most drastic in the test's 64-year history -
also include more emphasis on reading comprehension. The revised
SAT, called SAT-I, will be introduced in 1994, board President
Donald M. Stewart said.
   In addition, an optional test, known as the SAT-II, will be
phased in starting next year and will include an essay section.
   Critics who have charged that the test is culturally biased and
a poor judge of students' ability said the changes don't go far
enough.
   ``It's polish. It's adding new tailfins to the Edsel,'' says Bob
Schaeffer, public education director at FairTest, a Cambridge,
Mass.-based group critical of the SAT. ``The SAT should be optional
and it should be comprehensively overhauled to address its
problems.''
   Stewart said the revisions were aimed in part at reducing
students' reliance on test coaches. The changes will increase the
SAT's ``educational relevance and quality for all college-bound
students,'' he said.
   He denied the changes were prompted by charges that the SAT is
biased, particularly against women and minorities.
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Stewart said at the
board's annual meeting in Boston. ``The SAT has been in almost
continual evolution. It has never been set in concrete.''
   Gregg Driben, national director of pre-college programs for
Stanley Kaplan Educational Center Ltd., which prepares students for
standardized tests, said professional coaches still will play an
important role.
   The old SAT had 85 verbal and 60 math questions. SAT-I will have
75 to 85 verbal and 55 to 60 math questions. The new math questions
requiring students to produce an answer on their own will make up
about 20 percent of the math section.
   Sarah Stockwell, FairTest's university tests coordinator, said
letting test-takers use calculators ``is going to make worse an
already existing income bias'' because low-income students may not
have access to a calculator.
   Observers had predicted the essay would be included in the main
SAT. But Gregory Anrig, president of the Educational Testing
Service of Princeton, N.J., which administers the test, said field
trials showed an essay would make the exam too long.
   The SAT first was given to 8,040 students in 1926. Now about 1
million college-bound students take it every year.
   The 2{-hour exam currently consists of two multiple-choice
sections that test verbal and math skills. Each section is worth
800 points, for a perfect score of 1,600.
   FairTest and other critics have claimed that the SAT tends to
cover subjects that male and affluent test-takers are more likely
to be familiar with, such as sports and finance. Whites as a group
have outperformed minority students, and males have fared better
than females.
   In 1988 the National Organization for Women filed a lawsuit that
forced the New York State Education Department to stop using the
SAT exclusively to award state merit scholarships. The department
now uses high school grades as well.
   While College Board officials have steadfastly denied bias
allegations, a panel of educators the board appointed to evaluate
SAT revisions said the charges ``frequently stem from deep-seated
concerns that call for a thoughtful remedy or response.''

<TEXT>
   An effort to restore caribou to the wilds
of Maine has been pronounced a failure after predators killed many
of the ungainly reindeer.
   The Maine Caribou Project Inc. announced Wednesday that it is
abandoning its 4-year-old effort. Project officials said they doubt
they can raise the money needed to transplant enough caribou to
create a self-sustaining herd.
   Of the 32 caribou released in Maine, 25 are confirmed dead - 12
killed by bears and coyotes. The rest are unaccounted for, but
biologists believe only two or three are alive, and they apparently
have lost the radio collars used to keep track of them.
   Four caribou calves also were born in the wild. Two died of
unknown causes; a bear and bobcat killed the others.
   Caribou once were so abundant in Maine's north woods that a city
was named after the animal. But overhunting and disease left the
North American reindeer extinct in Maine more than 80 years ago.
   The restoration effort, which began with a caribou roundup in a
remote corner of Newfoundland, was the second since 1963.
   When the lastest caribou releases were planned, project leaders'
main worry was the deadly parasite known as brainworm.
   ``The whole black bear thing was something none of the
(biologists) considered to be a critical factor in the beginning,''
project spokesman Richard B. Anderson said.
   ``I think it's possible to restore the caribou to its former
range,'' he said. ``But you need a lot of animals.''
   That would take more money that project leaders believe they can
raise in a weakening economy.
   Biologists believe they'd need 50 to 100 more caribou to
succeed, but it would cost at least $300,000 to capture, transport
and monitor that many animals. The project, which officially ends
Dec. 31, has raised $500,000 so far.
   ``We have come to realize that only under an extraordinary set
of circumstances would it have been possible to complete a project
of this magnitude without organizational and financial support of
federal or state wildlife agencies,'' project leaders said in a
statement.
   The project's failure shows money ``is far better spent to
conserve Maine's endangered species today, while they still
exist,'' the statement said.
   Project leaders said they will share information with officials
in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Idaho, where caribou reintroduction
projects are proposed or under way.
   The last caribou from a native Maine herd was spotted on
mile-high Mount Katahdin in 1908.
   In 1963, about two dozen caribou were released in northern
Maine's Baxter State Park. All of the animals disappeared because
of poaching, disease, predators and natural dispersal, biologists
believe.
   In 1986, more than two dozen caribou in Newfoundland were shot
with tranquilizer darts and taken by helicopter and in trucks to
enclosures at the University of Maine in Orono, 1,200 miles away.
   Biologists kept the ``nursery herd'' in Orono to breed young
caribou for eventual releases in Maine's wilds. Of the dozen
released in Baxter park in April 1989, only one was known to have
survived by the end of that year.
   But project leaders discovered that caribou were more
susceptible to brainworm when penned. So all 20 animals in the
breeding herd were released, and plans were being made to import up
to 75 more caribou from Newfoundland.
   In January, however, the Baxter park's board denied permission
for a spring release. Board members criticized the way the project
had been run.

   The U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with
Iraq are biting Baghdad ``every day more and more,'' and should
force its economy to grind to a halt by midwinter, the Finnish
diplomat overseeing the embargo says.
   ``Nobody really thought that the sanctions would have a great
effect in a few weeks,'' Marjatta Rasi, Finland's deputy
ambassador, said Wednesday. She heads the Security Council's
committee on sanctions.
   ``I understand that at the beginning of next year they will have
serious problems,'' Ms. Rasi said. ``It's not only food, it's
everything.''
   ``The functioning of the society will slow down because they
cannot receive spare parts, even though they have taken everything
they could from Kuwait,'' Ms. Rasi said. She said Iraq had also
been a great importer of chemicals, ``and that is one great problem
for them.''
   Ms. Rasi said ``the sanctions bite every day more and more.''
   ``The food situation is not that bad, but the selection is not
that good,'' she said.
   Since no other nations are buying Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil, Baghdad
is not earning any foreign exchange. The Iraqi dinar is almost
worthless outside the country.
   In any event, the committee has no desire to starve the Iraqi or
Kuwaiti population, she added.
   The only items that may be sent to Iraq under the embargo are
medicine and medical equipment, and, in humanitarian circumstances,
food.
   On Aug. 6, the Security Council ordered a trade and financial
embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   On Aug. 25, it gave the United States and other naval powers the
right to enforce the economic embargo against Iraq and Kuwait by
halting shipping to those countries.
   On Sept. 13, the council voted to allow humanitarian food aid
into Iraq or Kuwait only ``to relieve human suffering,'' and said
only the council could decide when those circumstances exist.
   The Council on Sept. 24 stressed that only its sanctions
committee has the power to permit food, medicine or other
humanitarian aid to be sent into Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
   The following day, the council explicitly expanded its economic
embargo to include all air traffic in or out of Iraq and Kuwait,
except for cargos of humanitarian aid specifically authorized by
its sanctions committee.
   Passengers were not banned.
   Finland chairs the Security Council's sanctions committee; the
membership is the same as the council itself: the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France, China, Canada, Colombia, Cuba,
Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Accuses Britain Over Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that Britain has
refused entry to asylum-seekers who risk being returned to
countries where they could face imprisonment, torture and death.
   A report by the London-based human rights group said Britain's
refugee-determination system fails to uphold its obligations under
the U.N. Convention on Refugees.
   ``As many as 100, and possibly many more, persons seeking asylum
in the United Kingdom have been summarily and unlawfully expelled
without a proper examination of their asylum claim,'' the 42-page
report said without giving a specific number or time frame.
   ``In addition, an untold number of would-be asylum seekers have
been prevented from gaining access to the United Kingdom's
refugee-determination process,'' it added.
   The Home Office, in charge of immigration, said the report
failed to recognize that most asylum-seekers were not fleeing
political persecution under the terms of the 1951 U.N. convention.
   It said unfounded asylum claims were now widespread as a means
of circumventing normal immigration controls and that Britain has
been flooded with applications in recent years.
   The Amnesty report charged that Britain gives insufficient
advice to asylum-seekers and that officials subject them to
arbitrary and prolonged detention while their cases are being
considered.
   It said most of those who arrive saying they are seeking asylum
have no right of appeal when refused it.
   It said visa requirements and fines on airlines that arrive with
foreign passengers who don't have proper travel documents have
combined to obstruct bona fide asylum-seekers from gaining
effective access to Britain's refugee-determination system.
   The Home Office statement said refugee-determination systems
throughout Europe and North America are overwhelmed by unfounded
claims and that backlogs in the two regions have doubled to more
than 400,000 cases since 1985.
   It said that in Britain, applications for asylum have risen
fivefold since 1988 and have reached more than 20,000 in the past
12 months. It said backlogged applications in Britain now number
27,000.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains For Third Straight Day, Stocks Plummet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen for the
third consecutive day today, while share prices tumbled.
   The dollar closed at 130.70 yen, up 1.35 yen from Wednesday's
129.35-yen finish. It opened at 130.60 yen and ranged between
130.35 yen and 130.81 yen.
   The dollar now has climbed 3.35 yen in three days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 898.94
points, or 3.57 percent, to 24,295.16.
   In bond dealings, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds fell to 84.30 points from 84.60 points at
Wednesday's close. Their yield rose to 7.860 percent from 7.790
percent.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's strength followed its
rise on overseas markets. In New York, it climbed to 130.105 yen
from 128.725 yen on Tuesday.
   ``The dollar is on an upward trend, and major participants are
just buying the dollar,'' said Minori Takeuchi, an analyst at
Chemical Bank.
   Trading was active, with spot transactions totaling $14.758
billion, up from Wednesday's $10.516 billion.
   ``Japanese investors are trying to find the upper edge of the
dollar, and may push it as high as the 131-132 yen level,'' said
Masato Hayashi, a Bank of Tokyo dealer.
   On the stock market, dealers said the weaker yen and declining
bond prices pushed share prices down. Many investors were sitting
on the sidelines, they said.
   ``Higher oil prices and prolonged pessimism over the Persian
Gulf situation are other factors,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki of Daiwa
Securities.
   The Japanese economy is particularly vulnerable to a disruption
of energy supplies from the Middle East. The country imports 99
percent of its oil, and about 70 percent comes from the Persian
Gulf area.
   Trading was sluggish, and volume on the First Section was
estimated at 350 million shares, down from 400 million shares
Wednesday.
   Losers outnumbered gainers 1,003 to 29, with 41 issues
unchanged.

<TEXT>
   An evangelist ordered the devil to get out
of the San Francisco area without delay as a shrieking crowd of
1,000 pro-homosexual activists cursed him and his 5,000 Hallowen
``prayer warriors.''
   The two-hour confrontation Wednesday evening took place at the
Civic Center Auditorium, the site of a Christian crusade organized
by evangelists who say the city is plagued by immoral homosexuals,
crime, witchcraft and general sin.
   The protesters, who contended the meeting was an attack on
homosexuality, shouted profanities, waved insulting signs,
shrieked, chanted and blocked buses bringing the crusaders from
some 250 Northern California churches.
   They put up a 12-foot paper penis in the form of a cross in
front of barricades.
   ``We're queer, we're here, get used to it!'' they yelled.
   The demonstrators were held back by dozens of police in riot
gear. At one point, police had to reach in and pull crusade
participants through the crowd and into the auditorium, where they
and and their belongings were searched.
   The shrieking got so loud that officers put their hands over
their ears.
   The confrontation ended two hours after it started when the
demonstrators matched to the mainly gay Castro District, where the
city's typically outrageous Halloween festivities drew more than
150,000 people, many in drag.
   ``This is just good clean fun for us, a celebration of our
lifestyle,'' said Joe Van Es-Ballesteros, organizer of the drag
extravaganza.
   After the three-hour revival, motorcyclists tossed a tear gas
canister into a crowd leaving the hall, police said. Police donned
gas masks and some 300 people, their eyes tearing, fled upwind,
holding handkerchiefs over their faces.
   Officers said the canister hit a youth, who was treated for a
cut on his head. The motorcyclists escaped.
   Inside the hall, Texas evangelist Larry Lea, who organized the
crusade along with San Jose minister Dick Bernal, told a rapt
audience that the San Francisco region was beset by ``heavy ...
depressing'' spirits.
   As the audience prayed and shouted their love of Christ, some in
a joyful frenzy, the 39-year-old Lea ordered, ``Spirit of
rejection, begone from this area.''
   Lea, who distributes ``prayer army dog tags'' and has donned
military fatigues in previous crusades, said Halloween was selected
to launch his assault on sin because, according to legend, demons
are strongest at that time.
   ``This is not just kids having fun,'' he said. ``There is actual
worship of the devil.''
   The event is a function of a Pentecostal-Charismatic movement
that sees satanic princes and ``territorial spirits'' ruling over
particular cities, industries and subcultures.

   Anatoly Karpov blundered into a draw in the
ninth game of the world chess championship against Garry Kasparov,
leaving the match tied at 4{ points each.
   Karpov offered the defending champion a draw after 34 moves
Wednesday night.
   Chess experts agreed Karpov's advantage slipped away when he
lost a pawn on the 32nd move.
   Grandmaster Maxim Dlugy called it ``the most horrible blunder of
this match.''
   ``No one can remember Karpov making an error like this in his
tournament career,'' said grandmaster Nick de Firmian.
   The contestants have a victory and seven draws apiece. A victory
is worth a point, a draw a half-point. The first player to gain 12{
points wins the championship and $1.7 million of a $3 million
purse.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York, and the
remainder will be in Lyon, France.
   Game 10 will be Friday.

<TEXT>
   Navy sailors and Marines aboard the USS
Iwo Jima held a memorial service today for 10 mates killed in a
steam leak in the boiler room of the amphibious assault ship.
   More than 1,000 American servicemen stood to attention on deck
to honor the victims of Tuesday's accident, which claimed the
highest casualty toll the Navy has suffered since Operation Desert
Shield began in August.
   ``It was a somber ceremony that lasted about 40 minutes,'' Lt.
Jeff Gradeck, a spokesman for Command Naval Forces at Central
Command, said after returning to Manama from the ship, which is
anchored at the Bahrain Port.
   Six of the victims were killed instantly when the searing steam
burst out of a ruptured pipe in the boiler room.
   Four died of severe burns after they were ferried to the USS
Comfort, one of two hospital ships assigned to Operation Desert
Shield.
   All the bodies had been flown out before the memorial service,
which reporters and photographers were not allowed to attend.
   But reporters were later briefed on the event, which was
launched by a Color Guard of Navy and Marine personnel carrying the
U.S., Navy and Marine Corps flags and parading on deck.
   A Navy band played the national anthem. The servicemen sang the
Navy hymn then let off a volley of rifle fire in salute as trumpets
played taps.
   The Marines were in battle dress, the officers in khaki and
sailors in dungarees.
   Servicemen told stories about their departed mates, remembering
the laughs, games and work they shared.
   Chaplains read verses from the Bible and Capt. Michael O'Hearn,
the Iwo Jima's commanding officer, paid tribute to the fallen men
in a eulogy.
   With O'Hearn were Vice Admiral Henry H. Mauz, the overall
commander of the more than 50 warships deployed in the region, U.S.
Ambassador to Bahrain Charles Hostler and commanders from other
warships.
   Also present was Rear Adm. J. B. Laplante, who was flown from
the USS Nassau in the Arabian Sea to investigate the accident.
   Forty-three American servicemen have died in Operation Desert
Shield, which has drawn more than 220,000 American forces to the
region. It was launched in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Before Tuesday's accident, the Navy had lost only one sailor who
was electrocuted in August aboard the cruiser USS Antietam.
   The Iwo Jima, which is based at Norfolk, Va., has on board 1,100
Marines complementing the crew of normally 685 members.

   A 7-year-old girl collapsed and died
while trick-or-treating, and police were investigating today
whether her death was caused by a heart condition or poisoned
candy.
   Ariel Katz had been collecting candy with a group of children
chaperoned by two adults when she collapsed Wednesday night, said
police Lt. James Dawson.
   Her parents told authorities she had a heart murmur, but police
said they were checking her candy to see if it was poisoned.
   ``She had been eating some candy as she went,'' Dawson said.
   In nearby Los Angeles, an 11-year-old was shot and wounded on
Halloween when he refused to hand over his candy to four
teen-agers, police sad.
   He was treated at a hospital and released. No arrests were made.

<HEAD>Military Government Bans Unauthorized Monks Organizations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After sending troops to raid rebellious
Buddhist monasteries, the military government has banned
unauthorized monks' groups and threatened offenders with up to
three years imprisonment.
   The prime minister, Gen. Saw Maung, issued a decree on Wednesday
banning all groups except those formed under the auspices of the
main Buddhist governing body, the central Sangha.
   Offenders faced six months to three years in prison, according
to the decree, which was carried by the official Radio Rangoon
Wednesday.
   The central Sangha was formed in 1980 by a previous
military-backed government to regulate the clergy in the
predominately Buddhist nation.
   The current military government came to power in crushing a 1988
national uprising for democracy. It has refused to hand over power
to an opposition party that won May general elections, and instead
arrested party leaders and other dissidents.
   Monks began their protest by refusing to minister to soldiers
after troops in the central city of Mandalay broke up a
demonstration in early August, reportedly killing two monks and two
other people.
   On Oct. 21, Saw Maung issued a decree giving army commanders
martial law power to bring monks before military tribunals for
activities deemed disruptive to Buddhism. Sentences dispensed by
such tribunals range from a minimum of three years to a maximum of
death.
   The next day, troops began raiding monasteries in Mandalay to
break the monks' boycott.
   Political sources in Rangoon, contacted from Bangkok, said many
monks were detained in the raids, but it was unclear if the army
had succeeded in forcing an end to the boycott.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would be
difficult to break the boycott because groups of monks as large as
500 had entered into compacts to begin it. These vows could be
undone only if all those who took the vow were reassembled, he
said.
   State radio on Tuesday quoted the Mandalay commander, Maj. Gen.
Tun Kyi, as saying registration cards should be issued to all monks
as soon as possible.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts `Learnfare' Injunction in Wisconsin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted an injunction that
had halted in the Milwaukee area a first-in-the-nation, statewide
program that ties welfare benefits to school attendance.
   U.S. District Judge Terence Evans, who had suspended the
Learnfare program in July because of administrative errors, said
the state and Milwaukee County had agreed to safeguards to prevent
families' benefits from being cut by mistake.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson hailed the decision Wednesday, saying it
paved the way for the state to proceed with ``an even more
effective welfare reform program.''
   Learnfare allows the state to cut a family's welfare benefits if
a teen-ager has more than two unexcused absences a month. A mother
of two, for instance, can lose $77 of her $517 monthly check, and
sometimes more.
   Learnfare's boosters had said it will help break the cycle of
poverty. Others have branded it an administrative nightmare, but
proponents insist it works well everywhere but in Milwaukee County.
   Evans issued the injunction July 10 after several welfare
recipients complained they were sanctioned on the basis of
inaccurate attendance records.
   Milwaukee County and the state Department of Health and Social
Services have singe agreed to provide written notices to parents
and take other steps to very that a student is indeed cutting
class.
   If sanctions are to be imposed, the family will be given a
notice that includes the dates the student was absent.
   While the agreement applies only to Milwaukee County, it could
be expanded to cover the entire state, Legal Action lawyer Patricia
DeLessio said.
   More than 13,000 teen-agers are subject to Learnfare
requirements in Milwaukee County. About 12 percent were penalized
in June, the last month the program operated before its suspension.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. took a record $2 billion
third-quarter loss to close four auto plants and stop production at
several others.
   The $2 billion figure was the biggest quarterly loss in
automotive history. But the announcement Wednesday was hailed on
Wall Street as a signal that GM is serious about cutting costs and
becoming more competitive.
   ``GM wants to begin the decade of the '90s with a clean slate
and face the reality of the marketplace,'' said auto analyst Scott
Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co.
   GM said assembly plants in Pontiac, Mich.; Kansas City, Mo.;
Atlanta, Ga., and Framingham, Mass., that have been idle the past
three years will close permanently.
   The automaker also said it will stop production over the next
three years at truck plants in Scarborough, Ontario; Lordstown,
Ohio; and Pontiac, Mich., along with closing or consolidating
operations of some component plants.
   It was not immediately known how many workers would be affected.
   GM estimated the closures will cost $2.1 billion, including
promised payments to laid-off workers. That amount was charged
against $109 million in third-quarter earnings.
   During contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers last
summer, GM agreed to guarantee the income of workers laid off from
plants closed because of slumping sales.
   GM stock closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$36.75 a share, up 12{ cents, an indication that analysts and
brokers weren't worried about the loss.
   ``Most charges like this cause the stock to drop sharply,''
Merlis said.
   GM revenue for the third quarter rose to $30.8 billion, compared
with $28.8 billion during the same period last year.
   The $109 million in earnings that would have been posted without
the $2.1 billion charge were down sharply from $516.9 million
during the year-ago period.
   Third-quarter results reported earlier this week were also
dismal at Ford Motor Co., which posted a smaller-than-anticipated
profit of $101.7 million, and at Chrysler Corp., which lost $214
million.
   ``There is no question that the quarter is dismal,'' Merlis
said. ``This certainly reflects the further automotive downturn
induced by the Gulf crisis.

   Homicide detectives investigated the death of an
8-month-old boy found dead in a hospital, his breathing tube pulled
out and heart monitor disconnected.
   ``Somebody did this,'' the boy's mother, Theresa Bostic, said
through tears Wednesday. ``It didn't just come out, somebody did
this, somebody did this.''
   Detectives investigating the death of Nigel Bostic were
``leaning toward a homicide,'' said a police official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Nigel was found face down in his crib at Montefiore Hospital in
the Bronx on Monday, said Brian K. Regan, hospital vice president
of administration. He had been hospitalized Sept. 17 with breathing
problems caused by a constricted windpipe.
   The infant's tracheotomy tube, which helped him breathe, had
been removed from his throat and was found under his body by a
nurse who checked on him, Regan said.
   ``This is clearly a tragic situation. ... We are doing our best
to find out what happened, we are conducting a vigorous inquiry,''
he said.
   He said the baby had been doing well and was to have been
released from the hospital this week.
   Nurses told police and hospital investigators they saw the baby
playing in a walker earlier Monday and had checked on the child 50
minutes before he was discovered dead.
   ``The mystery is that 50 minutes between 3:25 p.m. and 4:15
p.m., and the focus of the inquiry is on that time,'' Regan said.

specifically bequeathed to someone else. The estate included
property in the Bahamas and Southampton, N.Y.
   Specific bequests include ``my antique desk, which was formerly
a gambling table,'' to the Museum of Broadcasting in New York.
   Paley's son William Cushing Paley of McLean, Va., also inherited

<HEAD>Security Personnel Fire Tear Gas In Struggle With Boat People</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Masked Vietnamese wielding homemade spears
battled tear-gas firing security personnel today at a camp for boat
people. Authorities said at least 16 people were injured, including
three security officers.
   The fight at the Whitehead Detention Center broke out in the
early afternoon as corrections officers conducted a sweep for
weapons, a government spokesman said. He said between 40 and 50
masked boat people were involved.
   Tensions are on the rise in Hong Kong's squalid detention
centers for boat people, temporary homes for thousands of
Vietnamese who fled their homeland only to face the likelihood of
repatriation.
   Government officials said the three security officers suffered
cuts and bruises, one Vietnamese woman was hospitalized and about
80 homemade spears were seized.
   The sweep for weapons followed a fight Wednesday night between
two groups of newly arrived boat people from the Haiphong area of
northern Vietnam.
   After firing three canisters of tear gas, the officers quelled
the outbreak, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   The violence was the latest in a series of skirmishes among boat
people and between Vietnamese and security personnel who patrol the
camps.
   Tensions have been rising in the camps following an agreement
between Vietnam, Britain and the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to speed the return of Vietnamese to their homeland.
   The agreement creates a new category of boat people - those who
``do not oppose'' being sent back to Vietnam. The UNHCR already
supervises a program that returns volunteers to Vietnam. So far,
4,899 have returned voluntarily.
   In a major policy change, U.N. officials will now be urging
Vietnamese who have no hope of achieving refugee status to return
home.
   Many Vietnamese in the camps view the new category as a veiled
way to force people back to Vietnam against their will. Since the
announcement of the agreement in late September, dozens of boat
people have gone on hunger strike opposing the agreement and the
UNHCR.
   One U.N. official described Hong Kong's camps as a ``tinderbox
waiting to catch fire.''
   UNHCR's representative in Hong Kong, Robert Van Leeuwen, said
U.N. officials have gone to great lengths to convince the boat
people that the U.N. has not agreed to forcible repatriation.
Today, he reiterated that point, saying his organization ``cannot
and will not be associated with forced repatriation.''
   But the U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the U.N.'s campaign has not convinced many boat people. He said
special phones have been installed in U.N. offices in the camps in
case of violence, adding that U.N. representatives are no longer
encouraged to move around the camps alone.
   He said officials are worried about repeats of violence such as
an incident in January during which six members of the Correctional
Services Department were held hostage for six hours in Whitehead,
the largest camp in Hong Kong.
   About 54,000 boat people, who fled communist Vietnam, currently
occupy hundreds of tin warehouses and cement cells in the camps,
where crime and other social ills flourish.
   Of them, 45,000 arrived after June 1988 when the British
colonial government instituted a screening program to separate what
it called legitimate political refugees from ``economic migrants.''
   Before that all boat people were considered refugees.
   Under the screening process, those who are determined to be
refugees will be allowed to stay and work in Hong Kong and await
resettlement abroad, while the economic migrants will be sent home.
   So far, 15,000 of the 45,000 have failed the test.
   The Hong Kong government forcibly repatriated 51 of them in
December but stopped that program after pressure from the United
States.
   The new agreement was borne of efforts by London to convince the
United States that the Vietnamese must be sent home.
   In a statement today, Leeuwen said the UNHCR hoped the first
flight containing the new category of boat people would take off in
November. Initially, the government planned to send the first group
back in October, but so far interest has been low.

   New worries of conflict in the Persian Gulf helped
keep interest in the dollar high today in early European trading.
Gold rose, also helped by the increasing talk of warfare.
   The major loser, European currency traders said, appeared to be
the yen, which already had some its recent support knocked away by
a sharp 898.94-point drop in the Nikkei index in Tokyo earlier
today.
   At Chase Investment Bank, currency analyst Andrew Ellott said
worries about the gulf were encouraging investors ``to err on the
side of caution'' and hold onto the U.S. currency. He reported a
renewal of strong interest in the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.70 yen, up 1.35 yen from
Wednesday's finish. Later in London, it was quoted at 130.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.5229 German marks, up from 1.5150
   -1.2925 Swiss francs, up from 1.2850
   -5.0983 French francs, up from 5.0725
   -1.7180 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7070
   -1,141.50 Italian lire, up from 1,135.50
   -1.1686 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1669
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9335, compared
with $1.9440 late Wednesday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recomended gold price of
$380.10 per ounce at midmorning, up from $379.75 bid per ounce late
Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $380.65, up from $379.25 late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 36 cents an ounce today to close at
$379.25.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.18 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $4.22.

<HEAD>Computers vs. Shakespearean Scholars: Whose Labors Lost?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alas, they're doubting poor Shakespeare
once more.
   This time, though, two computer whizzes have come to the bard's
defense.
   They have developed a program than determined there could be no
other author of the body of work attributed to William Shakespeare
than Shakespeare himself.
   Armed with their data, Ward Elliott and Robert Valenza, a
Claremont McKenna College computer science professor, challenged
the Shakespeare Oxford Society at the organization's annual meeting
in Pasadena on Saturday.
   The Shakespeare Oxford Society maintains that Shakespeare, the
son of an illiterate craftsman, could not have had enough knowledge
of the places and people to write the plays attributed to him.
Society members say Edward de Vere, the 17th earl of Oxford, was
more likely to have written them.
   The program by Elliott and Valenza analyzes blocks of text and
looks for patterns in the way the words are strung together.
Shakespeare's poems were plotted on a graph, as were other poets'
works.
   Elliott on Wednesday said all of Shakespeare's works are
similar, and those of the earl of Oxford look nothing like them.
   Elliott said he and Valenza also ran the poems through more
traditional tests, such as checking for hyphenated words,
exclamation marks, certain clauses and word endings.
   ``We gave the results of a half-dozen tests, including a new
test that is not quite as powerful as fingerprints, but powerful
enough to make every poet claimant that we tested an unlikely
claimant,'' Elliott said.
   As for the theory that Shakespeare's work may have been written
by a number of authors, Elliott said, ``If his work was written by
a committee it was an incredibly consistent committee.''
   Some Oxfordians dismissed the computer studies as ``word
counting'' and complained they were done by students outside the
field of literature. The program is run largely by economics,
political science and computer science majors.
   Ruth Loyd Miller, a lawyer and author who has researched the
question extensively, objected that the computer looked at words
without regard for context.
   Elliott, who is himself a member of the society and whose father
was an early Oxfordian, said, ``My conclusion was that the prospect
for Oxford was pretty bleak, but there are a few little shrubs for
cover.''
   ``I'd be surprised to see (the group) break up over my
evidence,'' he said.

<HEAD>Aging Writer Arrested After Pro-Democracy Crackdown Is Freed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A writer who's been imprisoned repeatedly for
criticizing authorities is free again after spending 14 months in
jail for joining the ill-fated pro-democracy movement - and said
today that he'll keep on writing.
   But 72-year-old Wang Ruowang, who was released Monday from a
Shanghai jail, refused to say whether he will speak out again for
the democratic change that came to a halt when the government
crushed the movement in June 1989.
   The prolific writer of essays and literary criticism laughed and
said, ``That's a good question. You can say that basically I have
studied well.'' All prisoners are advised to study the law and
party line to avoid future offenses.
   In a telephone interview today from his Shanghai home, Wang said
his case was not closed. ``I still have a tail,'' he said - a
Chinese expression that means one remains under a cloud.
   Wang said he remained under investigation and was still subject
to official questioning. He said he could not leave the city
without official permission.
   Still, his spirit seems unbroken. He laughed frequently during
the brief conversation and spoke in a strong, lively voice.
   Students and intellectuals demanding democratic reform marched
and held sit-ins for several weeks in Shanghai and other cities in
support of last year's student-led protests in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square.
   The potests ended peacefully in Shanghai, but troops and tanks
cleared Beijing's streets by force on June 4, 1989, killing
hundreds of people.
   Tens of thousands of people were arrested nationwide and accused
of counterrevolutionary crimes in connection with the protests. The
government says 355 people are still jailed in Beijing and two in
Shanghai, but it refuses to give a nationwide figure. Many, like
Wang, have not yet been tried.
   Wang's satiric writings and calls for artistic freedom landed
him in jail first under the Nationalist Chinese and later under the
Communists. He was expelled from the Communist Party in 1987 for
supporting student protests for democratic reform.
   When students began protesting again last year, Wang wrote an
open letter of support to senior leader Deng Xiaoping and helped
lead a march on Shanghai's city hall.
   He was placed under house arrest in July, the month after the
crackdown began, and taken away in September 1989. Shanghai sources
said he was not allowed during his imprisonment to communicate with
his wife, and was kept in apart from other prisoners in relatively
poor conditions.
   ``A writer not using his pen passes his days worse than a jailed
man,'' the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao quoted Wang as saying.
   Ming Pao quoted Wang as saying he lost some teeth and that his
eyesight weakened. But in the telephone interview today, he said he
was basically in good health.
   ``I'm resting - after all, I'm an old man,'' he said.
   Friends have described Wang in the past as tough and defiant by
nature. When expelling him from the party in 1987, Communist
officials gave a similar description but in less flattering terms.
   ``The party organizations patiently criticized and educated him
on many occasions but he refused to mend his ways. ... He asserted
that he would fight to the end,'' a Shanghai party leader, Rui
Xingwen, said in 1987.
   During his imprisonment, the Shanghai newspaper Wen Hui Bao
accused him of polluting the minds of impressionable youth and of
calling Deng a ``backstage emperor.''
   Wang joined the party in the 1930s but was denounced as a
``rightist,'' a ideological backslider, in 1957 and spent nearly
two decades in prisons or labor camps. He was rehabilitated in the
late 1970s.
   In 1988, Wang and other intellectuals founded a journal called
``The New Enlightenment'' that published daring, probing essays on
subjects such as alienation in a socialist society.
   Shanghai's Foreign Affairs Office said Zhang Weiguo, a reporter
for the Shanghai World Economic Herald, remains in jail, along with
a second person the office refused to identify. The Herald was shut
down for advocating political and economic reform.

   An Arab stabbed an Israeli garage owner 10
times in the chest and back in a Tel Aviv suburb today in the
latest in a wave of Palestinian nationalist attacks, police said.
   Shlomo Shtezi, 48, was stabbed in his automobile workshop in
Rishon Lezion by a former employee who had slept in the shop
overnight. Israeli army radio said he was in intensive care in a
nearby hospital.
   The victim's son, Kobi, said he rushed to the workshop after his
father called home to say he'd been stabbed.
   ``I went in and saw my father lying on top of cartons,
surrounded by blood, with stab wounds in his chest,'' the son told
the radio. ``There were pools of blood all over the workshop and
near the phone.''
   The Palestinian suspect was caught by soldiers at a military
roadblock as he was headed to his home in the Gaza Strip, District
Police Commander Hezi Ledder told army radio.
   Police spokesman Eli Maimon said investigators classified the
stabbing as a ``nationalist crime'' related to the Palestinian
uprising. The assailant was not identified by name.
   Ledder told army radio that 200 Arabs were rounded up following
the attack in an effort to both find the assailant and prevent
revenge attacks by Israelis. They were later released.
   The attack was the latest in a spate of revenge attacks set off
by the police response to an Oct. 8 riot on Jerusalem's sacred
Temple Mount. Twenty Palestinians were killed by police gunfire.
   Since then, attacks by both Arabs and Jews have left six dead
and more than 10 wounded.
   After revenge attacks last week, Defense Minister Moshe Arens
closed off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for four days,
barring Palestinians from entering Israel.
   On Monday, Arens announced tougher restrictions for Palestinians
to come to Israel from the occupied lands, saying he would ban all
those with records of crime or nationalist political activity.
   Increasing fear of Arab attacks by Jews was apparent in another
Tel Aviv suburb, Ramat Gan, when parents blocked their children
from taking a kindergarten day trip after discovering their bus
driver was an Arab.
   ``The minute I saw the driver I felt uncomfortable,'' one
mother, Ronit Bracha, said on army radio. ``After a few more
parents saw the same thing ... we went into the kindergarten and
said we didn't want our kids driven by an Arab.''
   An incident last May in Rishon Lezion set off an upsurge in the
34-month Palestinian uprising. An Israeli civilian shot to death
seven Arab laborers in the town after forcing them at gunpoint to
sit on the ground.
   The incident set off protest rioting in the occupied Gaza Strip
in which more than a dozen Palestinians died in army gunfire.
   Officials first said the Jewish assailant, 21-year-old Ami
Popper, was deranged, but a panel of psychiatrists later ruled he
was competent to stand trial. His trial has not begun, however.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is more open to a
peaceful settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis than he was in early
October, according to a Soviet envoy who met with him this week.
   Yevgeny Primakov, an aide to Presidet Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
told Soviet television Wednesday night that he detected a shift in
Saddam's position on resolving the showdown over Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Primakov also said Iraq had agreed on a schedule for Soviet
citizens to leave Iraq and that 2,500 would leave before the end of
November. He said 34 Soviet military experts were flying home to
Moscow today.
   Primakov, a Middle East specialist and close adviser to
Gorbachev, has been shuttling across the region at the Soviet
leader's behest. He met with Saddam on Oct. 5 and again on Sunday.
   He did not elaborate on what the differences were in the Iraqi
leader's views other than to say that Saddam on Oct. 5 insisted
that Kuwait was part of Iraqi territory, but on Sunday did not
raise that issue.
   ``My impression is that he is more in favor of a political
settlement, although I don't exclude the possibility that it will
take a long long time to come to this solution,'' Primakov said in
the TV interview.
   Although the Gorbachev envoy said the talks with Saddam focused
mainly on getting the remaining Soviet people out of Iraq, he also
said that ``I had instructions from the president to make it clear
during the talks that it is absolutely necessary to free all
foreign hostages.''
   There have been suggestions that Saddam might be willing to
withdraw from Kuwait if he is allowed to keep the Kuwaiti section
of an oil field that straddles the Iraq-Kuwait border and two
strategic islands that would improve Iraq's access to the Persian
Gulf.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Tuesday
that there were 4,008 Soviets in Iraq, including military
specialists and civilian contract employees.
   Primakov said he stressed again to Saddam that Iraqi troops must
withdraw from Kuwait. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Soviet Union
has backed all U.N. Security Council resolutions that condemned
Iraq and ordered an embargo on trade with Baghdad to force it to
relinquish the oil-rich emirate.
   Primakov's trip also included stops in the United States, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Syria.

<TEXT>
   Reporters scrambling for stories and prosecutors
trying to prevent news leaks that could jeopardize a trial will
inevitably clash, says Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Thornburgh told a luncheon session of the 56th annual Associated
Press Managing Editors convention here Wednesday that he supports
the media's right to publish without censorship. But he added that
prosecutors must put an individual's right to a fair trial before
any other concern.
   ``As much as the defendant has the right to remain silent before
the court, the prosecutor has the obligation to remain silent
outside the court,'' said Thornburgh, who has headed the Justice
Department since 1988.
   Prosecutors who leak information on pending criminal cases to
the media jeopardize not only a person's right to a fair trial but
also place the judicial system's integrity at risk, Thornburgh
said.
   ``His (a prosecutor) duties do not encompass the exposure of
suspected criminal activities for exposure's sake,'' the attorney
general told about 400 editors attending the luncheon.
   But he added that he appreciates the need for free and effective
news media.
   ``I share with you an abiding interest in the freedom of the
press, no matter how uncomfortable your copy makes us,'' he said.
   In a time of increasing crime, a free press is essential,
Thornburgh said, because the public wants to know if it is
receiving the ``truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.''

<HEAD>Foreign Investment: Good or Bad?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When foreigners invest $2 trillion in the
American economy you might think Americans would be thankful, since
that kind of money can make a real difference in living standards.
   But there's a drawback: Some of that money could lower rather
than raise standards.
   A policy report just released by the Committee for Economic
Development suggests that the good investment money often isn't
differentiated from the potentially bad money, thus confusing
public debates and discussions.
   The better money, it says, is direct investment in the ownership
of American businesses and properties, because it brings benefits
in the form of new productive capacity, technology, knowhow and
jobs.
   The less good, and potentially damaging, investments are in
portfolios of stocks, bonds and bank deposits - liquid investments
that can be dumped overnight in a crisis, thus worsening any
financial instability.
   Sudden withrawal of a sizable amount of stock investments, for
example, could produce an aberration in the Dow Jones industrial
average comparable in in destructiveness to last year's San
Francisco earthquake.
   To clarify the matter, which is one of the most confused topics
of debate in economic circles, the committee issued an explanatory
booklet titled ``What Does It Signal,'' appropriately followed by
three question marks.
   Claudia Feurey, vice president, said one goal of the corporate
executives and academics who make up the CED is to clear up
misconceptions about foreign debt, especially the difference
between direct and portfolio investments.
   Direct investments, in the form of real estate or plant
purchases, imply a long-term commitment to the U.S. economy, and a
significant portion of earnings are reinvested within the country.
These are relatively stable investments.
   They aren't altogether without potential drawbacks, among them
national security. Some critics fear also that foreign companies
might lower wages or weaken their U.S. subsidiary, but the CED
found no such evidence.
   Their concern was reserved primarily for portfolio investments,
by far the larger of the two types of foreign investment. Direct
investment accounts for a ``mere'' $500 billion, portfolios for a
giant $1.7 trillion.
   Not only are such investments unstable, they also are expensive
to Americans. Indirect (portfolio) investments often represent U.S.
debt, private and public, held abroad. Interest on it typically is
sent abroad.
   Paying interest generally is a burden, but it becomes more so
when the payment is spent elsewhere rather than reinvested locally.
If it is used to lower the foreign exchange rate of the dollar,
American living standards fall.
   The CED finds still another reason to worry about the level of
portfolio investments by foreigners. Those investments, it says,
seems to end up financing American consumption rather than
production of goods and services.
   But don't blame the foreigners for this drawback. The reason
their money isn't used for greater American production is because
of America's avaricious appetite for borrowing money in order to
consume. It's America's fault.
   This problem, says the report, is a direct result of national
economic policies and attitudes. If Americans curtailed government
and private borrowing for consumption, foreign capital could
instead finance productive investment.
   For example, it cites the push given the U.S. economy in the
19th century, when British capital was used to help build
railroads. As a result, jobs were created, efficiency of transport
increased and transportation costs fell.
   Moreover, the opening of the relatively undeveloped parts of the
continent produced economic benefits that can hardly be calculated
in terms of return on investment. Foreign capital helped make the
United States a powerhouse.
   The more precise question, therefore, may not be whether foreign
capital is good or bad, an asset or a drawback. The CED's view is
that it is both, and that for our own sake we had better get it
clear.

   An organizer who walked the streets with other
volunteers to deter arsonists on Devil's Night, Detroit's annual
Halloween eve fire spree, said children took over the streets the
next night to look for treats.
   ``The streets are overflowing with children. That's unusual,''
Ray Wright said Wednesday.
   ``But maybe all the positive feedback about the patrols keeping
down the trouble convinced the parents they could go out with the
kids tonight, unlike other years.''
   Devil's Night arsonists set scattered fires that gutted vacant
buildings and spread to occupied homes Tuesday night on Detroit's
east side, but neighborhood watch groups kept vandalism down
elsewhere in the city.
   Firefighters and thousands of block-watchers remained on guard
for the tail end of the fire spree Wednesday night. Few fires were
spotted by reporters driving around the fog-shrouded city, or
reported by citizen patrol groups.
   City officials have not yet released fire statistics. Mayor
Coleman Young said a news conference would be scheduled today or
Friday to announce the number of fires.
   Officer Allene Ray said children poured into neighborhood police
stations throughout the city to have their candy examined.
   ``The children are coming in in large numbers to get their
goodies OK'd,'' she said. ``I can only hope it's because their
parents feel safer this year. It's nice to see the kids in their
costumes.''
   Last year, the mayor's office reported 223 fires Oct. 29-31, 115
of those on Devil's Night. The firefighters union, however, said
there were more than 400 fires.
   The worst Devil's Night was in 1984, when 810 fires were set
during the three-day rampage. Dozens of families were left
homeless.
   Police arrested 154 youths Monday night and 91 Tuesday night for
violating 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfews imposed for Oct. 29-31 to quash
Devil's Night. By midnight Wednesday, 330 curfew violators had been
arrested.
   Police reported 379 curfew violations over the three-night
period last year.

   Subtle menstrual-cycle disturbances in women who
have outwardly regular monthly periods could be an important
underlying cause of bone loss that leads to fractures later in
life, a study today concludes.
   The hormones estrogen and progesterone are essential for
building and keeping strong bones, and their release in the body
follows the menstrual cycle.
   Doctors have long known that women who miss periods entirely,
such as those who exercise strenuously or don't eat enough, risk
weakening their bones.
   But the new research suggests that far less obvious disturbances
in the monthly cycle also are bad for the bones.
   The study, conducted at the University of British Columbia,
shows that women who do not ovulate, or release an egg, every cycle
lose 4 ercent of the bone in their spines annually, even though
they menstruate as usual.
   Jerilynn C. Prior, who directed the study, said stress and being
too thin may disrupt ovulation, and women who regularly miss
ovulation may need to take progesterone supplements to preserve
their bones.
   Women can have menstrual cycles that are regular in length and
flow but still not ovulate. In such cycles, women produce normal
amounts of estrogen but less than usual progesterone.
   Some premenstrual symptoms may accompany ovulation. Prior said
women can keep track of their ovulation by checking themselves for
mild breast tenderness, which is a regular sign of the egg's
release.
   In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
doctors monitored the menstrual periods of 66 women ages 21 to 42.
One-third were runners preparing for a marathon, one-third were
recreational runners and the rest were normally active non-runners.
   The doctors expected to see more menstrual disruptions in the
marathoners. Instead, they found that all the women had normal
cycles 97 percent of the time, and ovulation disturbances occurred
in 29 percent of their cycles. But the disturbances were no more
common in the avid runners.
   ``These results suggest that the maintenance of peak bone
density throughout adulthood requires normal ovarian production of
both estrogen and progesterone,'' the researchers wrote.
   However, since the study was conducted on a small, carefully
selected group, it is unclear whether ovulatory disturbances are
anywhere near as common in the general population.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. C. Conrad Johnston Jr. of
Indiana University and Christopher Longcope of the University of
Massachusetts suggested that the bone loss cited in the study had
been overestimated.
   ``If such loss were to continue, these women would have very low
spinal bone mass at the time of their menopause,'' they wrote, much
lower than is typically seen.
   However, Prior said she believes a lifetime of irregular
ovulation may be to blame for many of the fractures that occur in
women soon after menopause.
   Highly conditioned athletes frequently stop menstruating
entirely and are at high risk of losing bone and increasing their
risk of fractures.
   Dr. Deborah Riester of New England Medical Center in Boston, who
is looking for treatments for these women, said she sees women in
their 20s who have the bones of 50-year-olds.
   ``They think they are so healthy,'' she said, ``but they are
going to run into a lot of problems with fractures.''
   Riester said women who take birth control pills, which cease
ovulation, are not more susceptible to bone loss because the pills
contain hormones.

   Police imposed curfews and
other restrictions today on three violence-wracked black areas near
Cape Town, but lifted similar measures in 11 townships outside
Johannesburg.
   Also, President F.W. de Klerk held talks today with Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, on plans for
launching negotiations to end apartheid.
   De Klerk wants to begin talks next year with black opposition
groups, including Inkatha and the African National Congress, led by
Nelson Mandela. Faction fighting between the ANC and Inkatha has
slowed efforts to begin negotiations.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said late Wednesday that
recent violence had made it ``necessary to introduce extraordinary
measures'' in three townships outside Cape Town - Khayelitsha,
Crossroads and Lingulethu.
   Volk said township residents planned more protests and work
boycotts, but that police would use their expanded powers to
prevent unrest.
   A 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew went into effect today in the three
townships, which are home to hundreds of thousands of blacks.
   The measures announced by Vlok give police additional powers to
restrict demonstrations and other forms of protest. They are not as
severe as measures imposed under a four-year nationwide state of
emergency that was lifted in June.
   The Cape Town townships had been relatively peaceful until two
weeks ago.
   The recent conflict has been between anti-apartheid groups and
local town councilors. Many anti-apartheid militants see the black
councilors as collaborators with the white-led national government.
   More than 800 blacks have died in factional fighting outside
Johannesburg since August. The violence eased in October, and Vlok
said restrictions had been lifted in 11 townships east of
Johannesburg.
   Several Johannesburg-area townships remain restricted ``unrest
areas,'' including Soweto, where fighting Sunday left 17 people
dead and more than 30 injured.
   Most of the battles around Johannesburg have pitted Zulus loyal
to the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party against other blacks who
support the ANC.
   The ANC and Inkatha are the two largest black opposition
movements, and both oppose apartheid. But they differ over tactics
and plans for a future South Africa.
   Also today, police announced the arrests of five white men
believed linked to right-wing organizations. The men have not been
charged, but are being investigated for the possession of illegal
weapons and possible ties to the recent violence, the independent
South African Press Association reported.

   Patricia Hale hasn't heard anything of her husband since Aug.
24, so she welcomes Saddam Hussein's promise to release videotaped
messages from American hostages held in Iraq.
   But that offer, and an open invitation to hostage families who
wish to spend the Christmas and New Year's holidays with loved
ones, does little to appease the Spring, Texas, woman.
   ``With a situation this bad, it's hard to say what makes you
feel better. Of course I want to see Ed and make sure he's fine,''
Mrs. Hale said. ``But feeling better for me will be when I see him
getting off a plane.''
   With each day, winter draws nearer and Mrs. Hale grows angrier.
   Her husband, Ed, was wearing a short-sleeved shirt when invading
Iraqi troops removed him from an oil rig on Aug. 2. Now the desert
winter's unforgiving cold approaches.
   ``We don't want our husbands over there without proper food and
clothing,'' Mrs. Hale said Wednesday. ``If there's a way my
government can help alleviate that problem and they refuse to do
it, well, I find that totally unacceptable.''
   Hostage families said their minds were little eased by Saddam's
latest offers, which came a day after freed French hostages widely
criticized the conditions American hostages were facing.
   ``It's probably just another psychological ploy,'' said Dawn
Bazner, whose husband was videotaped early in the crisis asking
Saddam to let foreign women and children go. ``I'm hoping that we
won't have to visit (my husband) there ... but if it comes down to
it, I will go.''
   ``Some of the hostages are probably being treated fine, and sure
they'll videotape them,'' said Betty Seago of Johnson City, Tenn.
Iraqi troops captured her husband, an oil worker, and three other
Americans during an escape attempt.
   But, she asked, ``But what about the ones that aren't being
treated fine?''
   The families of many hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait have
repeatedly called the Kuwaiti Task Force at the State Department in
recent weeks to express concerns about the conditions under which
their loved ones are living.
   ``We are looking into the possiblilty of sending packages to our
embassy in Baghdad to be forwarded to the Iraqi government, which
would then hopefully forward them to the hostages,'' said Diane
Salisbury, a State Department spokeswoman.
   Similar attempts have been made to get letters to hostages, but
Ms. Salisbury said the process was complicated and the results
unclear. She also said it was not necessarily possible or advisable
to make contact with Americans in hiding.
   ``In any case,'' she said, ``we are holding the Iraqis
accountable for taking care of the hostages - whether or not they
receive packages from home.''
   Donnita Cole isn't willing to leave the situation up to the
Iraqis. The Odessa, Texas, woman has been on the phone to
Washington, D.C., daily for more than three weeks, pressing for a
way to get her husband the clothes he needs.
   ``At this point in the game I don't care whose responsibility it
is,'' said Mrs. Cole, who on Tuesday heard from a freed French
hostage who spent much of his captivity with 50-year-old John Cole.
   ``The Frenchman's words to me were: Please, please tell your
government it must get their men some cold-weather clothes,'' she
said. ``I've got to help John. When thetemperature starts falling
out there, I want him to have a pair of socks on.''
   Like Mrs. Cole and many other oil workers' wives, Mrs. Hale has
experienced the Middle East's frigid winters during stints living
abroad with her husband, an oil worker with OGE Drilling Inc.
   ``I think a lot of Americans have some misconceptions about the
desert climate,'' Mrs. Hale said. ``They think about sand and the
sun burning all the time.''
   ``But there's no place colder than the desert at night,'' said
Mrs. Cole, who has become fast friends with Mrs. Hale since the
crisis began.
   Mrs. Cole said that in his telephone call Tuesday, the freed
French hostage also warned her husband and other Americans were not
getting adequate nutrition.
   Freed foreigners have repeatedly warned of dwindling food
supplies but Ms. Salisbury said such reports were impossible to
confirm.
   ``We do think sanctions have taken some effect,'' she said.
``How much food is getting to people, however, is difficult to
assess.''
   Hostage families say they have grown increasingly impatient with
the occasional letter and second-hand reports that have emerged
with hostages - most recently about 300 French citizens - freed by
Saddam Hussein.
   President Bush echoed the hostage families' concerns while on a
campaign stop Wednesday in Alexandria, Va., where he declared: ``Do
you think I`m concerned about it? You're darn right I am. I have
had it ...''
   Margaret Williams, whose son and daughter-in-law are among
Saddam's ``human shields,'' has also begun to run out of patience.
Simple daily rituals grow more difficult each day.
   She sets the dinner table and recalls a month-old letter
smuggled out of Iraq in which her son says food is growing scarce.
She pulls an electric blanket down from the closet and thinks of
the desert winter.
   ``It's awfully hard to do these things when you know your kids
are suffering,'' Mrs. Williams said Wednesday from Germantown,
Tenn. ``We've just got to help these people out.''

<HEAD>Former FDA Official Convicted of Perjury in Generic Drug
Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chief of the U.S. Food and Drug
Adminstration's generic drug division has been convicted of lying
to FDA investigators and a congressional subcommittee.
   Marvin Seife, 66, was found guilty Wednesday of two counts of
perjury for denying he accepted meals from generic drug company
executives.
   Seife, who is retired, faces up to 10 years in prison and
$500,000 in fines. He is free on bond pending sentencing, scheduled
by U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove for Jan. 23.
   Seife, who headed the generic drug division for 18 years, was
the 15th person convicted in the investigation of alleged bribery
and fraud in the generic drug industry.
   Also convicted were FDA chemists and others of Seife's
subordinates who admitted accepting thousands of dollars in illegal
gratuities. Several companies have admitted giving the gratuities
to officials of the Rockville, Md.-based federal agency.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Geoffrey R. Garinther said Seife ``set
the tone for and presided over an unprecedented level of
mismanagement and corruption that almost brought down the generic
drug industry.''
   But Seife's defense presented him as a champion of generic drugs
and the small companies that struggled to get their cheaper
versions of brand-name drugs onto the market for elderly and
low-income consumers.
   By befriending generic drug executives and occasionally having
meals with them, Seife said, ``I felt I was giving them the
necessary encouragement to gain acceptance.''
   Seife acknowledged at least 14 meals prosecutors documented in
court but said he had forgotten about them. He said his memory was
fading because he was heavily sedated with aspirin for arthritis
pain.
   Seife's lawyer, Hamilton P. Fox, said he is considering an
appeal.

   Two American hostages, in letters released
today by a U.S. official, described life in the ``Iraqi gulag'' as
a nightmare of fear and uncertainty.
   The Americans were among thousands of foreigners trapped by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Many have since been released,
including hundreds of Western women and children and, this week,
French nationals.
   The official said the handwritten letters were brought to the
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad by other, non-American foreigners. The
identity of the letters' authors was not disclosed for security
reasons, and the official also demanded anonymity.
   ``I have been in the Iraqi gulag system for almost two months.
We are virtually prisoners in Iraq,'' wrote one of the Americans.
   Another, being held as a ``human shield'' at a different Iraqi
installation, described his isolation.
   ``I have been moved five times, not heard from anyone since Aug.
16 except for a message from my wife on VOA (Voice of America) on
Oct.5,'' he wrote. ``We are getting no mail or messages at all.''
   The writer added: ``Tell my wife I love her and I have lost 35
pounds.''
   The other American letter-writer compared the conditions of his
captivity to a jail.
   ``No telephone calls to anyone. Facilities ... very much like a
medium-security prison in the United States. Bars on windows, doors
locked.''
   The hostage said the windows were not barred, but about half a
dozen Iraqis lived in an adjoining room and guards with automatic
rifles guarded the facility at night.
   ``You can survive. But individually interned, (one) must be
psychologically capable of living alone within himself,'' the
letter said. It ended with a plea: ``Please do not forget the guest
hostages.''
   Iraq calls the detained foreigners guests.
   Iraqi officials have denied reports they are mistreating the
foreigners, calling such claims falsehoods that could be used as a
pretext for a U.S. attack.
   Diplomats in Kuwait and other foreigners are ``well-treated and
all receive good care,'' an Information Ministry spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The spokesman, commenting on condition of anonymity, also said
Iraq is prepared to allow the families of foreign hostages to visit
over the Christmas and New Year's holiday.
   The proposal appeared to be part of an overall Iraqi offer to
relatives of its ``foreign guests.'' Several Britons have already
visited captives, including wives visiting their husbands being
held in Iraq.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Iraqi offer of holiday visits boded ill for the captives.
   ``That's bad news,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``That means they will be here until the new year if not
later.''
   President Bush said Wednesday that his patience was running out
with Iraq's treatment of U.S. diplomats in Kuwait. The only Western
embassies that have not shut down in Kuwait City belong to the
Americans and British. Iraq's pressure tactics have forced all the
others to close.
   ``Our people inside are being starved by a brutal dictator,''
Bush said. ``And do you think I'm concerned about it? You're darn
right I am.''
   Information Minister Latif Jassim said it was possible the
United States was spreading ``false reports'' on conditions of
``foreign guests'' to seek an excuse to attack Iraq.
   ``I want to tell you that our guests live in good conditions at
some places better than many Iraqi families, but Bush perhaps wants
an excuse,'' he told a news conference.
   ``I think he wants to begin a war because his position at home
is very difficult,'' Jassim said.
   Asked what would happen to the captives should war break out,
Jassim said, `President Saddam Hussein has ordered that if war
begins the guests should get into shelters first.''
   ``You know we are Arabs, Arab Moslems. You know guests are very
important to us,'' he said.
   Jassim also said that war could break out soon, and declared
that the nation's 1-million-man army and civil defense were
prepared.
   Saddam told his military commanders Tuesday to prepare for war
with the United States.

   A traffic court judge says he exchanged gunfire
with would-be robbers masquerading as trick-or-treaters, wounding
one of the pair after they rang his doorbell, grabbed his wife and
shot first.
   Dade County Judge Harvey Baxter and his wife, Elaine, were
uninjured and identified a man who turned up at a hospital with a
gunshot wound, police said.
   ``I caught a guy in my home, and yes, I shot him,'' Baxter told
radio station WINZ early this morning.
   According to police, the two would-be robbers rang the Baxters'
doorbell at about 9:15 p.m. Wednesday night, when households were
expecting trick-or-treaters. The pair were wearing gorilla masks.
   When Mrs. Baxter opened the door, the pair brandished guns,
forced their way into the home and grabbed the judge's wife. She
screamed, telling her husband the pair were armed.
   Baxter, 59, rushed from the kitchen into the front room with a
.22-caliber pistol.
   ``We believe (one of the intruders) fired at the judge first. We
believe the judge fired in self-defense,'' Metro-Dade Police
Detective Tom Grippaldi said.
   The intruders fled in two pickup trucks, he said.
   Jeffrey Parnell, 37, was arrested this morning at Jackson
Memorial Hospital after he showed up to have the bullet removed,
Detective Lisette Williams said. Parnell was charged with attempted
murder, aggravated battery and other counts, Williams said.
Authorities were searching for the other suspect, she said.

   A judge agreed to postpone a grave-robbery
trial that had been scheduled to start on Halloween.
   Lawyers for both sides supported the change by Spokane County
Superior Court Judge James Murphy, who set a new trial date of Nov.
7 for defendant Charles D. Vigil.
   ``I wouldn't want to turn it into a macabre circus,'' said
Vigil's lawyer, Russell Van Camp. He contended starting the trial
on Halloween could be prejudicial.
   ``It would be a little bit too sensational,'' Spokane County
Deputy Prosecutor Steve Tucker said. ``I just believe the jury
would be waiting for me to say, `Trick or Treat!'''
   Van Camp had said he hoped the trial would be postponed ``as far
as possible away from this time of year, maybe until early
December, around Christmas, when people are a little more
forgiving.''
   Vigil, a 28-year-old hairdresser, is accused of felony
disinterment and mutilation of human remains. He was arrested May
20 at an old cemetery near Hillyard, northeast of Spokane.
   The prosecution's evidence includes a human skull, bones and two
tombstones police said were found in a pickup truck in which Vigil
had been riding.

<TEXT>
   Police imposed curfews in Bangladesh's
two largest cities today after one person was killed and more than
100 injured in riots triggered by a Hindu-Moslem dispute in
neighboring India.
   Trouble also was reported in six other cities in this Islamic
nation, in response to reports that Hindu fundamentalists in India
tried to replace a mosque with a Hindu temple. More than 175 people
have died in violence in India.
   The curfews started Wednesday in parts of Dhaka and the entire
port city of Chittagong after Moslem gangs attacked temples of
Bangladesh's Hindu minority. Hindu idols were smashed, and hundreds
of Hindu homes were set afire.
   The Dhaka curfew was extended today to the entire city of 7
million people.
   The police announcement of the curfew, broadcast by Radio
Bangladesh, did not say why the curfew was broadened. But witnesses
said Moslem gangs renewed their rampage by breaking into a Hindu
temple in downtown Dhaka where a curfew already had been imposed.
   Riot police chased the crowd of about 500 people with
steel-tipped batons.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   A senior Home Ministry official said the curfew extension in
Dhaka was a precautionary measure. ``The situation is under
control, and we want to remain on the safe side,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonimity.
   The independent Ittefaq newspaper said a Moslem businessman who
was shot during the anti-Hindu rampage in Dhaka died in a hospital
late Wednesday night. There was no immediate indication who shot
him.
   The newspaper said about 100 people were injured in Dhaka, most
of them from stabbings. Twenty-six were hospitalized.
   Ittefaq also reported anti-Hindu trouble in Jessore, Narail,
Gaibandha, Mymensingh, Sunamganj and Sylhet in northern and western
Bangladesh.
   It gave no details except that gangs attempted to break into
temples. Bangladeshi newspapers tend to be cautious in reporting
sensitive issues such as religious strife.
   In Chittagong, the trouble erupted Tuesday evening, several
hours after Hindu fundamentalists in India stormed into a 16th
century mosque they want to replace with a temple in the Hindu holy
town of Ayodhya.
   At least 11 Chittagong temples were vandalized. About 30 percent
of the 2 million people in Chittagong, the nation's second-largest
city after Dhaka, are Hindus.
   Police said they arrested 10 people in Chittagong, but witnesses
said they saw at least 35 people being led away by police.
   The curfew in Chittagong was relaxed for two hours today so
people could leave their homes to shop for food, but there was no
break in the curfew in Dhaka, a city of 7 million.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad appealed for peace in speeches
Wednesday and said his government would protect the minority
communities.
   Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, is an Islamic state whose
110 million people are 88 percent Moslem. About 10 percent are
Hindus.
   India, which borders Bangladesh on three sides, is predominantly
Hindu but officially secular. Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's
880 million people, and Moslems make up 12 percent.

   A dentist hopes to save a tooth or two
by offering to buy candy that children collected while
trick-or-treating.
   Dr. Carol Moreno said she's offering 50 cents for each pound of
candy kids are willing to part with Saturday at her office.
   She insists she isn't against sweets, just the damage they do.
   ``Even I have a soda at the movie theater,'' she said. ``But
kids should realize it really is a treat ... a special thing.''
   Besides the money - sorry, only $5 per child - Ms. Moreno will
give the children a dental screening and a bag of goodies, which
will include popcorn and a sticker or key ring.
   So far, the idea seems to have caught on with parents. ``They
seem to think it's a fine idea,'' Ms. Moreno said. ``Probably
because it's their children I've found cavities on.''
   And what does Ms. Moreno plan to do with the candy?
   ``I don't know yet. We're not sending it to Third World
countries or anything. We don't want any cavities there, either,''
she said.

   An escape artist who modeled himself after
Harry Houdini died in a Halloween stunt when tons of dirt and wet
cement collapsed the coffin in which he had locked himself.
   Joseph W. Burrus, 32, who billed himself as ``Amazing Joe,''
died at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday at Blackbeard's Family Fun Center, said
police Lt. Roger Enmark. The exact cause of death was not
determined.
   About 150 people, including some relatives, watched as aides
frantically dug at the dirt and cement to try to rescue Burrus from
the artificial grave.
   ``They attempted to get him out but it did no good,'' Enmark
said.
   Before the stunt, Burrus said he considered himself a successor
to the great escape artist Houdini, who died Oct. 31, 1926.
   ``I consider myself a master of illusion and an escape artist. I
believe I am the next Houdini and greater,'' Burrus said. ``To me,
that is what an escape artist is: to put myself in an impossible
situation and get out of it.''
   Burrus volunteered to do the stunt to benefit The Third Floor, a
drug rehabilitation program, said program manager Charles Lewis.
   ``He told me he had perfected this act and said he was a
recovering addict and wanted to do this show as a benefit,'' Lewis
said.
   Burrus was handcuffed, wrapped in chains, locked inside the
coffin, lowered into a 7-foot-deep grave and buried.
   Aides had lowered the coffin halfway when Burrus knocked on the
sides to tell them the chains were choking him, said assistant Sean
Henderson.
   They opened the casket so Burrus could loosen a chain around his
neck, then locked it again. ``He knocked on the side and gave two
thumbs up and told us to continue,'' Henderson said.
   Aides shoveled about three feet of dirt into the hole. A cement
truck poured another three feet of wet cement into the grave.
   ``As soon as we finished and the truck pulled away the whole
thing dropped. The cement busted the coffin. It buried him alive,''
Henderson said.

   Women and black candidates are fighting to
change the political landscape in high-profile races that could see
them take over three governorships and several seats in Congress.
   National attention is focused on black candidate Harvey Gantt's
strong bid to unseat Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and the big-state
gubernatorial candidacies of Ann Richards in Texas and Dianne
Feinstein in California.
   A raft of women and blacks are seeking office at the
congressional and state levels.
   Women's groups are pleased with the number of female candidates
seeking statewide office in Tuesday's election - 85 in all,
according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics.
   There are eight women running for governor and 19 for lieutenant
governor, a 42 percent increase over 1986. Eight are running for
the U.S. Senate and 68 for the House.
   Black candidates for statewide and federal office number 52,
including 21 incumbents, according to figures compiled by the Joint
Center for Political Studies. The research organization tracks
black politics.
   Gantt is the lone black nominated for the Senate, and his race
is a heated one. He has pulled a few points ahead of Helms in the
polls, with his campaign hoping for a dramatic upset.
   The milestone for women this year is that many are mounting
serious races for the Senate and statewide offices, political
activists say.
   ``Having Dianne Feinstein and Ann Richards run as credible
competitors for very major and very important governorships is
history-changing,'' said Wendy Sherman, executive director of
EMILY's List, a group that raises money for female Democratic
candidates.
   ``Win or lose, it does change the landscape, we believe forever.
Neither of them are beginners,'' in contrast to the ``lambs to the
slaughter'' women candidates of the past, she said.
   In fact, said Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's
Campaign Fund, ``If there's an irony to the 1990 election, it's
that women are finally positioning themselves as traditional,
serious candidates - and now the electorate favors the mavericks.''
   ``Now that we've learned to play the game, they've changed the
rules,'' she said.
   Nonetheless, women are looking to make significant gains.
   Rep. Pat Saiki, R-Hawaii, is considered the best shot women have
at gaining a Senate seat. She is running against appointed
incumbent Daniel Akaka.
   Two other Republican Senate hopefuls who have received
considerable attention, but are lagging in the polls behind
Democratic incumbents as Election Day nears. They are Rep. Lynn
Martin, seeking to unseat Sen. Paul Simon in Illinois, and Rep.
Claudine Schneider, running against Sen. Claiborne Pell in Rhode
Island.
   Democrat Patsy Mink, an Asian-American and a former
congresswoman, won a special election to fill the last few months
of Akaka's House term and is in a good position to keep the seat.
   Other races where gains for women intersect with those expected
for minorities include those of three likely new members of the
Congressional Black Caucus:
   -Maxine Waters, a Los Angeles Democrat virtually assured to
succeed Rep. Gus Hawkins, a retiring Black Caucus member.
   -Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat trying to succeed Walter
Fauntroy as the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to
Congress.
   -Barbara Rose Collins, a Democratic Detroit councilwoman who is
considered a shoo-in over Carl Edwards to succeed outgoing Rep.
George Crockett.
   Other House races to watch involving women include these
contests where the incumbent is not seeking re-election:
   -Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, in a strong race against
Thomas Scott, a Republican state senator.
   -Sandra Scofield, a Democrat running against Republican Bill
Barrett, the speaker of the Nebraska legislature.
   -Trudy Coxe, a Republican environmentalist running against
Democratic state Sen. John F. Reed in Rhode Island.
   With two women governors - Madeleine Kunin in Vermont and Rose
Mofford in Arizona - stepping down, Democrats are putting high bets
on Feinstein, Richards and Barbara Roberts, who has made a strong
showing in Oregon.
   Other women seeking governorships include: Republican Arliss
Sturgulewski in Alaska, Democratic state Treasurer Joan Finney in
Kansas, Republican Barbara Hafer in Pennsylvania and Republican
Mary Mead in Wyoming.
   In addition, Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, a Republican, is seeking
re-election.
   Observers say overt sexism has not played much of a role in this
year's races, except in Texas where Republican Clayton Williams has
made a practice of outlandish remarks. He made light of rape in
one, and also joked he planned to ``hog-tie'' Richards and drag her
through the dirt.
   ``Women have run pretty much genderless campaigns,'' said
Danowitz, noting that the candidates have run, not just on issues
like abortion rights, but also taxation, crime and defense
platforms.
   In minority politics, the Republican Party is trying to make
history by electing the first black GOP member of the House of
Representatives since 1935, when Rep. Oscar DePriest of Illinois
left office.
   The GOP has three blacks running: former Cincinnati Mayor J.
Kenneth Blackwell against current Cincinnati Mayor Charles Luken,
who wants to succeed his father, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio; Gary
Franks, running against former Rep. Toby Moffett in Connecticut;
and businessman Al Brown, who is trying to knock off Rep. Romano
Mazzoli in Kentucky.
   Of the three, Blackwell is considered the most likely to
succeed.
   In addition, blacks stand to pick up one seat held by a white
person. Two black Democrats, attorney Marc Morial and state Sen.
William Jefferson, are competing in the open-party runoff to
succeed retiring Rep. Lindy Boggs in Louisiana.
   Another important signpost for blacks is the Democratic
nomination of a black, Theo Mitchell, to run for governor of South
Carolina.
   Although Mitchell isn't likely to win, his candidacy shows
inroads by blacks at the state level in southern states, according
to David Bositis, senior research director at the Joint Center for
Political Studies.

   A man added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted
List for fleeing child molestation charges was arrested one week
after being featured on the television show ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Kenneth Robert Stanton was arrested without incident by FBI
agents as he emerged from a motel in Rock Hill on Wednesday.
   Agents began looking for him in the area after he was identified
as a suspect in the molestation last week of a 9-year-old girl in
Rock Hill, about 70 miles north of Columbia.
   FBI agent-in-charge John Harley said Stanton, who turns 52
today, was being held in Columbia and awaiting extradition to
Georgia.
   The Huntington, Ind., native was charged with fondling two girls
in Warner Robins, Ga., in June 1989 while posing as a police
officer.
   In all, he faces 11 counts of child molestation involving girls
in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi last summer, Harley said.
Stanton was not charged with the Rock Hill incident, but was a
suspect, Harley said.
   Stanton posed as a variety of authority figures to gain access
to homes, Harley said.
   Stanton fled his Moraine, Ohio, home after FBI agents were led
there by the Oct. 24 episode of NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,''
Harley said.
   More than 150 people called to say he was living and working in
the Dayton, Ohio, area, where he had gotten married two weeks ago,
according to an ``Unsolved Mysteries'' news release.
   Stanton, who was wanted by federal authorities for unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution, was placed on the 10 Most Wanted List
last week by FBI Director William Sessions, Harley said.
   ``It appeared that (Stanton) was traveling throughout a broad
area of the country molesting children in a calculated way, which
indicated to us that he was going to continue doing it until he was
apprehended,'' Harley said.
   The list normally is reserved for people accused of violent
crimes.
   Stanton also faces charges of burglary and impersonating a
police officer in Georgia.
   In the 1960s, Stanton was charged with sex crimes against
children and was committed to a state psychiatric hospital in
Michigan. He later escaped, but was recaptured in Arizona and
returned. Stanton remained at the hospital until doctors decided he
was fit for release.

<HEAD>Hostage Families Call for Renewed Links with Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Archbishop of Canterbury urged
the British government today to restore diplomatic ties with Syria
to help secure the release of British hostages held in Beirut.
   Spokesman John Lyttle said the government's refusal to tal was
a ``silly way to conduct foreign policy.''
   On Wednesday, Lyttle attended a meeting in Dublin between the
families of British hostages and the relatives of four Iranian
diplomats missing in Lebanon since July 1982.
   The get-together was organized by the Iranian embassy in Dublin
at the request of Brian Keenan, an Irishman who was freed from four
years of captivity in August following intervention by Syria.
   Also at the meeting were the wife and brother of the Archbishop
of Canterbury's special envoy, Terry Waite; the father of TV
journalist John McCarthy; the nephew of retired pilot Jack Mann and
Keenan's two sisters.
   ``It was a very moving meeting. It was an amazing demonstration,
I think, of a shared common grief,'' Lyttle said in an interview on
British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   He said there was hope for a release of British hostages, but
added: ``I think for the first time the families of the British
hostages have a quite serious disagreement with the policy of the
British government, that is the policy towards Syria.''
   Britain broke diplomatic relations with Syria in 1986 after
accusations of Syrian involvement in a terrorist plot to blow up an
Israeli airliner at Heathrow Airport.
   Lyttle accused Britain of wanting Syria to admit its involvement
and to ``in effect grovel.''
   ``You cannot expect one state to grovel to another any more than
you can expect one individual to grovel to another. If you want to
have some successful outcome, you have to look at how Syria has
behaved over recent years, whatever they may be accused of doing
four years ago,'' he said.
   Lyttle noted that Syria has sent troops to the multinational
forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``Yet we maintain the attitude that we will not talk to them, we
will not have diplomatic relations with them - that is a silly way
to conduct foreign policy,'' Lyttle said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman responded: ``We have consistently
made clear our wish to normalize relations with Syria but there are
unresolved problems.'' He refused to elaborate, but observers say
Britain is still concerned by Syria's alleged involvement in
terrorism.
   Mariam Moussavi, whose husband Seyyed is believed to have been
kidnapped by Lebanese Christian forces, said the Iranian families
were ``asking other governments to help us see our loved ones
again.''

<HEAD>Justice Says No Evidence So Far Terrorists Used Drug Probe in
Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said today it had found
no evidence so far that terrorists exploited an undercover drug
investigation to bomb Pan Am Flight 103, but the allegations would
be reviewed by the FBI.
   Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr said that ``while at
this time we know of no evidence giving credence to these
allegations, it is important to examine these allegations and to
determine their credibility as soon as possible.''
   As part of its ongoing investigation into the 1988 bombing over
Scotland that killed 269 people, the FBI will review reports that
terrorists used a Drug Enforcement Administration undercover
operation in Europe to put explosives on the Pan Am flight.
   Both the DEA and the FBI have been looking into the allegations
in the last few days since they were aired by NBC-TV. But law
enforcement sources speaking on condition of anonymity said no
substantiation had been found.
   After the report was aired Tuesday night, the DEA put out a
statement that it was investigating the allegations that terrorists
may have substituted luggage containing explosives for heroin that
undercover agents were allowing on board U.S.-bound aircraft in
Frankfurt, Germany.
   The undercover investigation, nicknamed ``Operation Courier'',
was said by NBC to be aimed at tracking heroin shipments to Detroit
by Lebanese drug traffickers.
   NBC reported that terrorists may have discovered that an
arrangement between the DEA and German security officials would
enable them to substitute luggage containing bombs for suitcases
containing heroin.
   One of those killed in the blast over Lockerbie, Scotland, was a
21-year-old suburban Detroit resident, Khalid Jaafar, who was
returning home from Lebanon.
   Investigators once believed that Jaafar had unwittingly checked
a brown Samsonite bag containing a bomb before boarding the flight
in Frankfurt. Later they determined that Jaafar carried two smaller
bags on board the airplane. Both bags were subsequently recovered
following the explosion over Scotland.
   The New York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt and stopped in
London, where passengers and luggage were transferred to a larger
airplane.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Globe today endorsed Republican William
Weld for governor, saying the former U.S. attorney has the
``disposition and character'' to face the state's economic and
fiscal problems.
   The Globe said in an editorial that Weld and his Democratic
opponent, John Silber, were evenly matched on some scores but gave
Weld the edge saying his leadership style was more likely to get
results.
   The newspaper praised Weld's record as a U.S. attorney, saying
he combatted organized crime and profiteering by defense
contractors.
   The Globe also said Weld has come out ``unequivocally'' on
women's issues - favoring job equity, expanded day care and
abortion rights.
   Silber, on leave as president of Boston University, was credited
by the Globe for his intelligence and competence in his
professional field, but faulted for his ``tart-tongued behavior''
and his ``intimidating tactics.''
   A smaller newspaper in the western Massachusetts town of
Pittsfield, The Berkshire Eagle, endorsed Silber today in an
editorial headlined ``A fingers-crossed vote for Silber.''
   The Eagle said the risk with Weld is that it ``would take a long
time for him to learn the ropes in state government and discover
where savings can be achieved without hurting the state's
vulnerable citizens.''
   With Silber, the newspaper said, ``People have gotten a glimpse
of a searching mind that is open to new approaches.''
   ``Mr. Silber, for all his prickliness and occasional outright
wrong-headedness, has earned a chance to show what he can do,'' the
editorial said.

   Federal agents say they found similarities
between a pipe bomb used by a Georgia man in 1972 and bombs that
killed a federal judge and an attorney last year.
   The bombs' construction was unlike that of any of 10,000 bombs
that federal agents have dissected, Agent Frank P. Lee of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said in an
affidavit made public Wednesday.
   Similarities included the use of ``square end plates with
threaded rods extending from plate to plate within the pipe and
secured with nuts,'' the February search warrant affidavit said.
   That construction ``is unique to the explosive device'' Walter
Leroy Moody Jr. was convicted of having in 1972 and three of four
mail bombs sent in December 1989, Lee said.
   He said he based the conclusion on a computer search of ATF and
FBI records describing more than 10,000 bombs nationwide since
1975.
   One of the December bombs killed Judge Robert Vance of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Another killed Savannah
lawyer Robert Robinson. Two other bombs were safely intercepted at
the 11th Circuit offices and at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of
the NAACP.
   Moody, 56, of Rex, is a suspect in the slayings but has not been
charged. He's being held without bail on unrelated charges.
   Moody and his wife, Susan, 27, are charged with obstruction of
justice, bribery and witness tampering for allegedly trying to
erase his 1972 conviction for possessing the pipe bomb that injured
his ex-wife, Hazel.
   The Moodys have requested separate trials. Walter Moody's trial
is set for Nov. 27.
   U.S. District Judge Anthony A. Alaimo on Monday granted the
Moodys' request to move the trials from Macon to Brunswick, where
he is based. The ruling was made public in a written order
Wednesday.
   Alaimo gave no reason for moving the trial. The Moodys'
attorneys had argued that extensive news coverage had hurt chances
of getting a fair trial in Macon.
   U.S. District Judge Wilbur Owens of Macon had removed himself
from the case at Moody's request and was replaced by Alaimo.
Moody's attorney, Edward D. Tolley, also wants Alaimo removed,
arguing that the case shouldn't be heard by any judge in the
Georgia-Alabama-Florida region covered by the 11th Circuit.

   Israeli warplanes blasted guerrilla targets in
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley today, the military command said.
   It said the targets were used as ``launching'' bases for
guerrilla attacks on Israel.
   A command communique said the planes struck at the village of
Madjal Balhees near Lake Qaraoun, 19 miles north of Israel's
border. It did not identify the guerrilla group or say whether
there were casualties.
   The planes returned safely, it said.
   Army radio reported that Israeli jets raided the same village in
September 1989, hitting a base of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command headed by Ahmed Jibril.
   Today's raid was the 16th air strike by Israeli jets this year.
The last raid was Oct. 24 when jets bombed sites used for launching
Katyusha rockets fired at Israeli targets.

   Bowing to pressure from environmentalists,
McDonald's Corp. announced today it will phase out plastic foam
packages for its Big Macs and other food.
   ``Although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging
is environmentally sound, our customers just don't feel good about
it,'' McDonald's USA President Edward H. Rensi said. ``So we're
changing.''
   The decision was hailed by an environmental group, which
predicted McDonald's will be a trend-setter in the industry.
   ``McDonald's understands that the future is green,'' said Fred
Krupp, executive director of the Washington-based Environmental
Defense Fund. ``I think other companies will follow suit.''
   Krupp's non-profit group has worked with McDonald's since August
to devise the phase-out plan, said Krupp, who joined Rensi at the
company's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters for the announcement.
   ``I think it's a big day for the American public,'' said Rensi.
``We've been studying this issue of environmental problems and
McDonald's is not interested in doing anything but the right
thing.''
   Rensi said the company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., will begin
eliminating its foam sandwich containers within 60 days.
   He said the sandwich containers account for nearly 75 percent of
the fast-food chain's foam use, and the move would mean a
``significant reduction'' in the volume of packaging used by
McDonald's.
   Some communities have banned polystyrene containers outright,
putting additional pressure on McDonald's 8,000 U.S. restaurants to
eliminate the use of plastic foam.
   Jim Cantalupo, president of McDonald's International, said the
company would continue testing for the best materials to replace
plastic foam, and would ``phase them into our restaurants as they
become available.''
   The plastic sandwich boxes will be replaced by paper products
manufactured in a new process that will preserve the food's
temperature and freshness, Rensi said. The company is still trying
to determine suitable replacements for plastic cutlery and the
plastic cups in which coffee is served, he said.
   McDonald's has for years defended its use of the plastic, which
lingers for decades in landfills.
   In April, Rensi said McDonald's, which serves 22 million people
daily worldwide, had no plans to shift away from using plastics. He
said polystyrene containers could be recycled, while coated paper
used in food packaging often could not.
   He also said then that the company would spend $100 million a
year on recycled materials when building outlets or renovating.
   McDonald's last week posted a record net income of $242.2
million or 67 cents a share for the third quarter.

   Atlantis' secret military flight
next week has been postponed because of problems with a satellite
aboard the shuttle that reportedly will spy on Iraq.
   The Air Force said Wednesday it was delaying the Nov. 9 launch
``to resolve anomalies discovered during cargo testing.'' ``Details
are classified, and it is too early to predict a new launch date,''
the Air Force said in a statement.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity estimated the delay
would be one to two weeks.
   The delay was disappointing news for NASA, which just last week
pronounced Atlantis free of dangerous hydrogen leaks and ready to
fly after being grounded during the summer along with Columbia.
Columbia passed a leak test as well on Tuesday.
   Shuttle director Bob Crippen said today that NASA is going ahead
with plans to launch Columbia with the $150 million Astro
observatory in December, following Atlantis' flight. He said NASA
was working with the Air Force to resolve the problem with
Atlantis' cargo.
   ``A specific target launch date for the (Columbia) mission will
not be determined until after the flight readiness review has been
conducted and performance data'' from Atlantis' flight have been
analyzed, Crippen said.
   NASA officials have said they want at least three weeks between
the flights.
   Civilian experts have said Atlantis' secret cargo is a satellite
that will spy on Iraqi forces.
   It is the seventh shuttle flight dedicated entirely to the
Pentagon, and the last classified mission. Two more military
missions are planned, both next year, but their cargoes are
unclassified.
   ``The bottom line is it's no longer affordable'' to maintain
security, said a Pentagon official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The space agency had planned nine missions this year, but
because of the leaks in Columbia and Atlantis, it hopes now to get
six aloft.
   NASA last launched Atlantis on Feb. 28 on a classified mission;
it carried a reconnaissance satellite into orbit. The Soviets
reported in March the satellite blew up, but amateur astronomers
said this week they spotted it orbiting 503 miles above Earth.

   A federal judge has limited to $750,000 the money
an AIDS-infected Marine Corps officer may collect for emotional
damages in the AIDS-related deaths of his wife and son.
   Marine Chief Warrant Officer Martin Gaffney, a computer
specialist at South Weymouth Naval Air Station, sued the Navy for
$55 million.
   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel earlier this year found Navy
physicians in California were negligent in giving Gaffney's wife,
Mutsuko, a transfusion with blood infected with the AIDS virus
during a 1981 pregnancy.
   The judge said in a ruling filed last week that she was guided
by California law, which limits money awards for emotional damages
to $250,000, the sum she awarded for each infected family member.
   An award based on economic damages is yet to be determined.
   Gaffney has said he feels he also is dying of AIDS. He has said
the trial, which was split into the liability phase and the damages
phase, is taking longer than expected.
   Gaffney's daughter, Maureene, has tested negative for exposure
to the virus. Gaffney has said the damages will provide for her
after his death.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds FAA's Mandatory Retirement Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago has upheld a
30-year-old Federal Aviation Administration rule that forces
commercial airline pilots to retire at age 60.
   The three-judge panel voted 2-1 Wednesday against a group of
airline pilots who sought to have the rule overturned.
   But all three judges voiced reservations about the ruling. The
senior judge, Hubert Will, wrote a strongly worded dissent.
   The FAA established the retirement rule in 1960 and has argued
consistently that allowing pilots to fly beyond age 60 would be
dangerous.
   Critics say that pilots in their 60s have experience that
benefits passengers, and cite the 1989 crash of a United Airlines
jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, to back their case.
   In that crash, a 57-year-old pilot landed a jet, despite a
crippled hydraulic system.
   While ``safety is the dominant and controlling consideration ...
the FAA should not take this (ruling) as a signal that the age 60
rule is sacrosanct and untouchable,'' U.S. Appeals Court Judge
Richard Cudahy said in writing for the majority.
   But Cudahy said there was insufficient evidence to overrule the
agency's concerns that older pilots pose health and safety risks.
   Lawyers for the 30 pilots said they had not decided whether to
seek a rehearing from the appeals court or to take the issue to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Pilots older than 60 have have twice as many accidents as those
in their 50s, but they're still safer than pilots in their 20s or
30s, according to a congressional report released last month.
   The Office of Technology Assessment, which did the study,
reached no conclusion on whether the Federal Aviation
Administration should revise its regulation forcingretirement at
age 60 for pilots on major major airlines - those which operate
planes with more than 30 seats.
   No such requirement exists for corporate, private or
commuter-airline pilots.
   Last month the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
sued Lockheed Corp. over the company's requirement that its test
pilots retire at age 60.

   Police today began interrogating a man
authorities said was the first suspect to be extradited from the
United States during the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising. The man
is accused in a fatal bus attack.
   Mahmoud Atta, also known as Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmed, was whisked
away in a police van immediately after his arrival Wednesday night
at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, said Justice
Ministry spokeswoman Etti Eshed.
   Atta, 37 and a U.S. citizen, has been accused of taking part in
a 1986 machine-gun attack on a bus carrying Jewish settlers in the
occupied West Bank. The driver was killed and a passenger wounded.
   He was arrested in the United States three years ago. On Aug.
31, the Supreme Court rejected his final appeal against
extradition.
   Two of his cousins were convicted of taking part in the bus
attack and received life sentences for that and other crimes, Mrs.
Eshed said. She said police had evidence Atta planned the attack
and fired at least six bullets at the bus from an Uzi submachine
gun, killing the driver.
   On Friday, the State Department said it had ``specific and
credible'' information about possible attacks on passenger ships in
the eastern Mediterranean by the Abu Nidal group, to which Atta
belonged.
   The group, a renegade offshoot of the PLO known as The
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, is headed by Sabri Al-Banna, uses the
nom de guerre of Abu Nidal.
   The group is believed responsible for some of the worst
terrorist incidents of the last decade, including 1985 attacks on
the Rome and Vienna airports in which 16 people were killed.
   But the best-known attack on a Mediterranean cruise ship was
carried out by another group, led by Abul Abbas. It hijacked the
Italian liner Achille Lauro n 1985 and murdered an American
passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.

<TEXT>
   Four homeless people have filed a class-action
lawsuit against the city seeking clean and safe public toilets.
   The suit filed Wednesday against the city and two transit
agencies contends the failure to provide toilets constitutes a
public nuisance. It says the plaintiffs, three men and a woman, are
``forced to endure continual embarrassment, humiliation, physical
injury and hazardous conditions.''
   The Legal Action Center for the Homeless, which represents the
plaintiffs, said the lack of public toilets in the city is a
hardship not only for the homeless, but also for pregnant women,
the elderly, tourists and outdoor workers.
   ``It's getting worse every day,'' said executive director Doug
Lasdon. ``It's disgusting.''
   A report by the center said that of 105 Transit Authority rest
rooms surveyed, fewer than one-third were open to the public, and
half of those were in bad condition.
   A survey of 526 stations in the city's 1,540 parks found that
nearly three-quarters were ``closed, filthy, foul-smelling or
without toilet paper and soap.''
   Leland Jones, a spokesman for the mayor's office, said, ``I'm
not sure this lawsuit moves us any closer to really dealing with
much more difficult issues, like the adequacy of housing stock.''
   Betsy Gotbaum, commissioner of parks and recreation, said she
was committed to solving the problem of unclean restrooms but
added: ``I don't believe comfort stations should be used by
homeless people to take baths, to take care of their personal
needs, because that makes them unavailable for other people to
use.''

   The leader of a right-wing coalition
that defeated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's party at the
polls was chosen today to head Pakistan's fifth civilian government
in 43 years.
   Nawaz Sharif, whose backers shared in a landslide victory in the
Oct. 24 parliamentary elections, was assured the prime minister's
post after receiving the nomination from 18 parties comprising the
Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   The next prime minister will be elected by secret ballot in the
217-seat National Assembly, the law-making lower house of
Parliament. Voting could take place as early as Sunday.
   The new Parliament is to be sworn in Saturday. Since the
alliance controls 105 seats in the assembly, the vote for Sharif is
seen only as a formality.
   A battle for the prime minister's job had been expected between
Sharif and Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, who served as caretaker prime
minister after Ms. Bhutto's government was ousted on corruption
charges three months ago.
   According to coalition members, Jatoi reluctantly bowed to
Sharif.
   Sharif, 41, a wealthy industrialist, was Ms. Bhutto's fiercest
opponent and chief minister of eastern Punjab, the largest province
and the powerhouse of Pakistan politics.
   As leader of the winning alliance, he has been largely credited
with orchestrating the campaign that denied Ms. Bhutto and her
Pakistan People's Party a second chance at power.
   The Moslem League, the party that spearheaded the campaign for
the creation of Pakistan in the 1947 partition of the Indian
subcontinent, is the largest member of the Islamic Democratic
Alliance, the loose-knit coalition that spans the ideological
spectrum.
   The decision to choose Sharif was made during a meeting of
senior party officials, said Moslem League president Mohammad Khan
Junejo. It was not known when or where the meeting took place.
   Jatoi has headed the caretaker government since President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan on Aug. 6 dismissed Ms. Bhutto's administration after
only 20 months, alleging corruption and mismanagement.
   Ms. Bhutto faces several corruption charges filed by special
courts investigating her former administration.
   Sharif told reporters today no new cases would be filed against
Ms. Bhutto, disputing her claims that another 16 party loyalists
would soon be charged.
   Jatoi is still believed to be heavily favored by the country's
two most powerful institutions - the military and the bureaucracy.
   Sharif is seen by many groups in Pakistan as a possible catalyst
to improve conditions in Pakistan, where most of its 110 million
people are landless, illiterate and earn about $400 a year.
   His family's multi-million dollar steel foundary was launched by
his father from a lone oven in the ancient eastern city of Lahore.
The business diversified to include steel foundary, sugar and
textile mills.
   Sharif closely guards information about his personal wealth.
   ``I'm certainly not as rich as the Bhuttos,'' he once told
reporters when asked to estimate his wealth.

<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce
directed federal grants to political friends and later misled
Congress about his involvement, congressional investigators said
today.
   Their report stopped short of concluding Pierce committed
perjury before a House panel or that he and others at the agency
violated criminal laws. It said those questions would be left to
the special prosecutor now investigating Pierce.
   An attorney for Pierce said the report was politically motivated
and contained ``spurious allegations.''
   The report, the result of a House subcommittee's 16-month
investigation of the Reagan administration's Department of Housing
and Urban Development, said Pierce concealed the extent of his
involvement in the steering of federal housing grants.
   ``At best, Secretary Pierce was less than honest and misled the
subcommittee about his invovlement in abuses and favoritism in HUD
funding decisions,'' the report said. ``At worst, Secretary Pierce
knowingly lied and committed perjury during his testimony.''
   The report was released by the House Government Operations
Committee, whose employment and housing subcommittee investigated
the scandals involving favoritism, mismanagement and political
abuse at HUD, where Pierce served as secretary throughout the
Reagan years.
   Pierce appeared before the panel in May 1989, then invoked his
Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in refusing to
appear for further questioning.
   Subcommitee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said in an
accompanying statement that Pierce ``tried to distance himself from
the abuses and political favoritism at HUD'' when he appeared
before the panel.
   ``He stated that he `never told these people to fund
anything','' Lantos said. ``However, sworn testimony from other
witnesses and a paper trail of documents suggest that he was
directly and intimately involved in the abuses and favoritism in
HUD funding decisions.''
   Pierce's lawyer, Paul Perito, said he had not seen the report
but dismissed it as ``the last gasp of a politically oriented and
motivated investigation'' by the House panel.
   ``With all of these spurious allegations, there is not one piece
of evidence that Mr. Pierce violated his oath by receiving anything
of value or in any way defrauding the United States government,''
Perito said.
   ``They have been suggesting alleged perjury from day one,'' he
added. ``Once again, there is nothing in the record to support the
conclusions regarding the alleged perjury.''
   Among the report's findings:
   - HUD under Pierce was ``an agency in total disarray and was
woefully mismanaged.'' Housing programs established to help the
poor were abused, and HUD ``was enveloped by influence peddling,
fvoritism, abuse, greed, fraud, embezzlement and theft.''
   - The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program, a system of
grants to private developers to renovate housing for the poor,
``became a cash cow which was milked by former HUD officials and
the politically well-connected.'' Abuses in that program alone
could cost the goverment $413 million in overpayments, the report
said, while other HUD problems will cost taxpayers more than $1
billion.
   - Officials at many public housing authorities around the
country were aware the selection process for the moderate
rehabilitation program was being abused but chose to exploit it
rather than attempt to expose abuses.
   - Deborah Gore Dean, Pierce's executive assistant from 1984 to
1987, was at the focal point of funding decisions for the moderate
rehabilitation program. The panel cited as evidence many ``Dear
Debbie'' letters from developers and politically connected
consultants seeking grants, and Dean's actions in directing HUD
officials to sign program-funding documents.
   But the report said congressional investigators were unable to
conclude whether Dean acted on her own, or whether she was acting
at the direction or with the approval of Pierce. It said evidence
indictated she directed grants to political allies at the behest of
Pierce on several projects, including the Durham, N.C., Hosiery
Mill project, while on other projects, such as Seabrook Apartments
in New Jersey, Dean appeared to be the chief proponent.
   Dean refused to testify before the panel, citing her
constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
   - There was a pattern of favoritism shown to Pierce's former New
York law firm, Battle, Fowler, Jaffin and Kheel, including
assistance to clients of that firm who were seeking moderate
rehabilitation grants.
   - The report criticized the HUD inspector general as unfairly
singling out one HUD official, Thomas Demery, as the focus of the
700-page investigative report on the moderate rehabilitation
program that triggered the HUD scandal in early 1989. Others, such
as Pierce and Dean, were barely mentioned then.
   The congressional report praised the inspector general's office
for revealing abuses but said ``the watchdog did not bark loud
enough'' in its earlier reports on problems in the agency. It said
Congress should have paid more attention. And it said Congress
should halt the practice of earmarking funding in appropriations
bills for specific housing projects it favors.
   The Bush administration's secretary, Jack Kemp, drew praise for
acting to clean up the agency.

   President Bush said today he is ``more
determined than ever'' to drive Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of
Kuwait.
   Bush, embarking on a six-day, cross-country campaign blitz for
endangered Republicans, told a GOP rally in this Boston suburb, ``I
want desperately to have a peaceful resolution to this crisis.'' At
the same time, the president's spokesman told reporters Bush was
deliberately raising his profile on the gulf crisis.
   ``If we do have to take dramatic action, we want them (the
American people) to know why,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said. He did not elaborate.
   Bush said he wanted to make it, ``very, very clear, there will
be no compromise'' on the United Nation's demands for a complete
withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``Today I am more determined than ever: this aggression will not
stand,'' he said. ``The brutality against innocent citizens will
not be tolerated and will not stand.''
   Bush said he still intended to give economic sanctions time to
work.
   ``No one wants a peaceful end to this crisis more than I do, but
no one is more determined to see this aggression turned back. And I
will not change on that fundamental point of morality,'' he said.
   Bush said that the United States and the rest of the world
remain ``united in anger and outrage'' at the treatment of hostages
by ``Iraq's brutal dictator.''
   The president asked his audience to join him in setting aside
partisan politics when it came to his administration's Persian Gulf
policy.
   ``I am not a cynic. I have no apologies, only pride at being at
a partisan event,'' he said. ``But for the moment ... set partisan
politics aside.''
   Fitzwater also said there would soon be ``a turning point'' in
the status of the U.S. diplomats remaining in the embassy in Kuwait
City.
   ``At some point, they've either got to leave or be
re-provisioned,'' he said. He declined to say how many days longer
the group could hold out. He said he did not want to tip off
Saddam.
   In Bush's campaign speeches today, the president appeared to
tone down his harsh criticism of congressional Democrats on budget
issues. Instead, Bush devoted nearly half of his first speech to
discussing the gulf situation.
   Fitzwater said Bush was being urged to continue his caustic
attack on Democrats ``in certain quarters ... but he surveyed the
whole matter and decided this was the best approach.'' Thus,
Fitzwater said, the president has decided to spend more time
highlighting the gulf standoff.
   While realizing he might be subject to attacks for politicizing
the gulf situation, Fitzwater said, ``because he is president, we
didn't see how he could duck it.''
   ``We want a public debate'' over new developments in the Persian
Gulf. ``We want public knowledge of this,'' Fitzwater said.
   Responding to reports that Saddam had invited hostage families
to visit their relatives in captivity in Iraq and Kuwait over the
Christmas holidays, Fitzwater said: ``Why doesn't he let the
hostages come home? That would be the best way - or better yet,
Thanksgiving.''
   Bush campaigned here for Republican gubernatorial candidate
William Weld, who is seeking to succeed retiring Gov. Michael
Dukakis, Bush's 1988 Democratic presidential opponent.
   While the president says he is keeping the two subjects - the
Iraqi confrontation and politics - separate, Bush was expected to
make repeated references to the Persian Gulf standoff as he
travels.
   In a trip scheduled to keep him on the road until Election Day,
Bush is campaigning for GOP gubernatorial and congressional
candidates in close races in Massachusetts, Florida, Ohio,
Minnesota, Iowa, California, New Mexico and Texas.
   After leaving Burlington, Bush was traveling to the Cape Cod
community of Mashpee for another rally for Weld, who is in a close
race against Democrat John Silber.
   Bush also was to speak in behalf of GOP Senate challenger Jim
Rappaport, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. John Kerry.
   Later, he planned to campaign in Orlando, Fla., before ending
his day in Cincinnati.
   Bush's political journey will end Election Day in Houston, when
he votes at his ``home'' precinct. His legal residence is a suite
at the Houstonian Hotel.
   The president was focusing on a handful of tight races in the
closing days of the midterm elections.
   In Orlando, he was seeking to rally last-minute support for
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who is facing a spirited challenge
from former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   With the president's popularity in the polls slumping and
Republicans seeing their hopes for big midterm gains evaporating,
some candidates in tight races have been keeping Bush at arm's
length.
   A stop planned for this week in Illinois was canceled after GOP
Secretary of State Jim Edgar, who is running for governor, and Rep.
Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is running for the Senate, expressed
displeasure with Bush's support for new taxes.
   Campaign stops planned for Oregon, Nebraska and Arizona also
were scrubbed.

   Registering children as sheep is one
way New Zealand families might be able to afford to bring up
children, an economist told a conference Thursday.
   As sheep, their food, accommodation and other expenses would be
tax deductible, Brian Easton told the conference on child-rearing.
   ``The mother might even be eligible for shepherd's wages,'' he
said.
   Easton was critical of New Zealand's claim to being ``a great
place to bring up kids.''
   He said parents are required to make great sacrifices to raise
children and their financial struggles are largely ignored.
   New Zealand, dependent on a rural economy, has some 60 million
sheep and 3.3 million people.

   Forestry workers recently spotted a Manchurian
tiger and cub in the wild, ending a three-year controversy over
whether the animal has survived in China's forests, the Xinhua News
Agency reported Thursday.
   The tigers were seen on the northern slope of Mount Changbai in
northeast Jilin province. Zoologists estimated that only 80
Manchurian tigers roamed the region's wooded mountains in the late
1960s. Only 30 were left by the early 1980s due to hunting and
destruction of their range by farmers and foresters.
   A 1987 aerial survey failed to find any trace of the tigers in
China's wild.
   Xinhua reporter Zhu Youli, contacted by telephone in Jilin's
capital of Changchun, said the foresters spotted the two tigers in
July but told few people. He said traces of Manchurian tigers also
have been seen in the past year in neighboring Heilongjiang
province.
   About 100 Manchurian tigers live in Chinese zoos. About 300
survive in the wild in the Soviet Union and an undetermined number
live in North Korea, according to the China Wildlife Protection
Association.

   The feared berry borer is panicking
coffee growers in southern India who say the insect is devastating
their crops.
   Hundreds of acres already have been destroyed by the pest, which
may have stowed away with refugees from Sri Lanka fleeing to
southern India.
   Coffee earned India $195 million in foreign exchange this year,
making it one of the nation's most important agricultural exports.
   The bug ``is slowly creating panic'' among growers, Anil
Bhandari, chairman of the Karnataka Planters Association, told
reporters Wednesday. The southern state of Karnataka supplies 70
percent of India's coffee.
   The berry borer, which attacks the coffee bean and bores into
the seed, was first noticed in India about seven months ago in a
region with a large settlement of Sri Lankan refugees, the
association said.
   The insect has created havoc in some of the world's biggest
coffee-growing countries, including Brazil, Ecuador, Kenya,
Malaysia and Borneo, the growers said.

   Police galloped their horses through a crowd
of several hundred demonstrators who had been pelting riot police
with stones and bottles, news reports said Thursday.
   About 300 protesters, many masked and wielding clubs or chains,
refused to clear the street Wednesday night outside a student
seminar on nationalism. They tried to keep alleged racists from
joining a debate panel.
   Ten mounted policemen charged the crowd and were followed by
more than 100 officers, using shields and dogs to disperse the
demonstrators.
   One policeman was slightly injured when he was dragged from his
horse and clubbed. Several demonstrators also suffered minor
injuries. One was arrested.
   ``They had been throwing stones at the police for a long time.
In the end we had no choice. We either had to use tear gas or the
horses. We chose the latter,'' Oslo Police Chief Willy Haugli told
Verdens Gang newspaper.
   The protest was called by Blitz, a youth group known for violent
confrontations with police. The panel continued the debate.

<TEXT>
   Vermont, once the most Republican state
in the nation, may soon send a socialist to fill its lone seat in
the House of Representatives.
   Bernard Sanders is emphasizing his long-standing disillusionment
with Capitol Hill to mount a strong challenge to Republican Rep.
Peter Smith.
   ``The U.S. Congress is hopelessly and pathetically out of touch
with the needs of ordinary Americans,'' says Sanders, a socialist
running as an independent.
   The latest polls show Sanders in a dead heat with freshman
congressman Smith.
   The Democratic candidate, Dolores Sandoval, is running third.
Most state Democrats are abandoning her as too liberal and too
unlikely to win.
   Smith has questioned how effective an independent can be in
Congress, where committee assignments are made by Republicans and
Democrats. Sanders says he'll ask to caucus with the Democrats, but
it's unclear whether he would be admitted.
   Sanders says he's not a member of the Socialist party but is a
socialist ``with a small s.''
   The last time an independent served in Congress was in 1975, and
the last time a House member called himself a socialist was in
1929.
   Smith has countered his opponent's strong showing with
television ads accusing Sanders of being sympathetic to the
socialist regime in Cuba. The ads contend Sanders is a politician
who doesn't represent Vermont values.
   Sanders says Smith's ads engage in ``vicious, dishonest
redbaiting.''
   Smith responds that Sanders is ``trying to outrun his history.''
   Sanders, meanwhile, is relentless in his attacks on Washington.
And while Congress-bashing is a newly popular song for some
politicians this fall, it's an old favorite of Sanders'.
   ``What the two major candidates are saying is irrelevant
regarding the problems facing this country,'' Sanders said in a
1971 special election campaign for a U.S. Senate seat. ``The people
who make decisions which affect this country have little to do with
the average man in the street.''
   And in this campaign, he said: ``Multinational corporations and
wealthy people are able to buy and sell politicians, who then go
down to Washington to fight for tax breaks for the rich and
cutbacks in programs for the elderly.''
   Sanders also rejects the Democratic Party, which he once called
``ideologically bankrupt.''
   Such comments alienated former Democratic Gov. Thomas Salmon,
who is supporting Smith, one of the most liberal GOP members in the
House. But former Democratic Gov. Philip Hoff sides with Sanders.
   Smith voted with Democrats more than half the time in 1989,
according to Congressional Quarterly. He received a 65 percent
approval rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic
Action, and a 27 percent rating from the American Conservative
Union.
   Smith, just back from Capitol Hill after the lengthy budget
battle, is encountering opposition from gun groups angry because he
backed a measure to ban the sale of certain semiautomatic rifles.
   The National Rifle Association is airing anti-Smith radio spots
and circulating bumper stickers.
   ``I would have voted for you, but the NRA says you're not the
man to hire,'' one man said as Smith campaigned this week.
   Sanders began his campaign decrying Congress' handling of the
savings and loan scandal, but has found new fodder in the fight
over the federal budget.
   Smith was the first rank-and-file member of either party to back
the original budget deficit-reduction package, a vote Sanders
termed ``one of the most disastrous votes ever cast by a
representative from Vermont.''
   Smith defends the vote, saying because the budget package was
only a start it was important to back the bipartisan plan developed
by the Democratic and Republican leadership of Congress and the
president.
   Smith was one of only 10 Republicans to support the Democratic
budget plan that eventually passed the House. Sanders has said he
could not support that plan because of its Medicare cuts.

   Thousands of drivers spent the night
stuck in a 120-mile-long traffic jam on the autobahn between
Nuremberg and Berlin. Police said Thursday they could not remember
a bigger traffic tie-up.
   The two-lane stretch of the highway has been dubbed the
``Trabant Racetrack,'' named after the slow, two-stroke cars made
in what was East Germany. They are used by most Germans from that
part of the country.
   The backup developed late Wednesday as drivers from eastern
Germany returned home after a one-day holiday. A series of minor
accidents, rain and fog and construction delays brought traffic to
a halt.
   Authorities also reported a 30-mile jam on the highway between
Hanover and Berlin.
   Last year's opening of the borders between the two German states
and the Oct. 3 unification has caused a huge increase in traffic
between the two parts of the country.
   Traffic jams have become common on the autobahns, which are
designed for high speeds and powerful cars. There are no speed
limits on most parts.

others working 1{ miles underground, officials said Thursday.
   The quake, registering 2.5 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, hit the area around the Western Deep Levels East mine late
Wednesday, the Anglo American Corp. said. The mine is near
Carletonville, about 40 miles west of Johannesburg.
   Rescuers continued their effort to reach the four trapped miners

where a group of homeless people lived, killing one man and
injuring several others, police said.
   Investigators said they dd not know any motive for the attack,

   The gang, numbering 10 to 12, crossed a footbridge from upper
Manhattan to Ward's Island in the East River late Wednesday and
attacked the shantytown in a wooded area, police said.
   The gang escaped after the attack and no arrests were made.
   A 35-year-old homeless man, whose name was not released while
police searched for relatives to notify, was slashed across the
throat and was pronounced dead at the scene, said police Officer
Janice Swinney.
   At least six men were taken to hospitals with stab wounds and
numerous bruises inflicted by baseball bats and pipes, and three
were treated at police stations, Swinney said.
   One homeless man required 55 stitches after he was slashed in
the face with a meat cleaver. Another required 30 stitches and one
needed 20 stitches for similar injuries, Swinney said. But all
three were treated and released.
   Ward's Island, beneath the Triborough Bridge, holds the Fire

<HEAD>Audit Blasts Agency For Bungling Forest Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal mismanagement of some of the world's
most productive timber lands has cost the government at least $90
million since 1986, an Interior Department audit disclosed
Thursday.
   Mishandling of Bureau of Land Management forests in western
Oregon is the result of financial shortcuts prompted by budget
cutbacks, the department's Office of Inspector General said.
   The report said the BLM lost $90 million by failing to perform
thinning, fertilization and other maintenance that resulted in
fewer trees that could be cut. The BLM estimated it lost 94 million
board feet of timber growth in the fiscal years 1986-89 due to
inadequate management. A board foot is one foot by one foot by one
inch.
   In addition, the BLM has failed to acquire easements to 132,000
acres with 800 million board feet of mature timber valued at $302
million.
   Losses could total as much as $1.7 billion over the forests'
60-to 80-year life cycles, the report said.
   The audit of BLM forestry operations on 2.4 million acres across
18 Oregon counties criticized the agency for failing to explain the
magnitude of the losses to Congress and the Office of Management
and Budget.
   BLM Director Cy Jamison said in response to the review that his
budget requests have been ``somewhat constrained'' by funding
targets provided by the Interior Department, its parent agency.
   ``These targets, which are less than ideal to accomplish the
desired workload, are consistent with the goals of the
administration to reduce federal deficits,'' Jamison said in a memo
to the inspector general's office.
   The audit covering fiscal years 1986-89 noted that BLM forestry
revenues will further decline as additional lands are taken out of
production to protect the threatened northern spotted owl.
   The BLM estimated in June that efforts to save the owl from
extinction may directly affect 23 percent of its lands in western
Oregon, about 553,000 acres, and may indirectly affect another 1.5
million acres there.
   The BLM holdings are ``some of the most productive timber lands
in the world,'' said the audit prepared by assistant inspector
general Harold Bloom.
   Bungling of the forest program is especially costly because the
program historically returns $4.30 for every $1 spent, the audit
said.
   The review questions whether the BLM will be able to achieve
next year's timber harvest target of 750 million board feet because
the agency's funding request for its forestry program was more than
20 percent short of the $66 million needed.
   It also discounts BLM claims it can use smaller fragmented
tracts of timber to replace timber from larger tracts of forests
where logging is being banned to protect the rare owl.
   ``Easements for the smaller scattered tracts of timber lands
have not been obtained because the bureau has concentrated on
obtaining legal access for the larger consolidated tracts,'' the
audit said.
   In addition, the audit said the BLM has:
   - Based its budgets on plans to use herbicides to control
underbrush although herbicides have been banned on Oregon BLM lands
since a federal judge issued an injunction in 1984. Manual efforts
cost three times more than herbicides.
   - Failed to place sufficient priority or secure sufficient funds
for maintenance of the tree plantations, including placing tubes
around seedlings to protect them from wildlife.
   - Failed to perform intensive management programs, including
fertilization and pre-commercial thinning to provide proper spacing
between trees.

   Vice President Dan Quayle says the world
cannot allow Iraq's Saddam Hussein to keep his ballistic missile
and chemical weapons even if he withdraws from Kuwait.
   ``You cannot simply allow Saddam Hussein to have this military
power and have the technology into the future,'' Quayle said
Wednesday night in an interview on PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour.
   Quayle reiterated that the United States' main objectives in the
Persian Gulf are the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's troops from
Kuwait, restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait, release
of all hostages, and peace and stability in the gulf.
   But Quayle said, ``We would have to go beyond that if those
objectives would be achieved because you cannot simply allow Saddam
Hussein to have this military power and have the technology into
the future.''
   ``I believe that the world certainly understands that. A Saddam
Hussein who has ballistic missiles, who has chemical capability,
biological capability, who would like to have the nuclear
capability, cannot continue to have that capability even if he
withdraws from Kuwait,'' said the vice president.
   ``This man is a terrorist, this man is a murderer,'' said
Quayle.
   Craig Whitney, a spokesman for Quayle, said today, ``His
comments were fully in line with the administration's views and
policies.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters aboard Air
Force One today between campaign stops in Massachusetts that
Quayle's statement was in accordwith what President Bush has been
saying. Sununu said Bush has ``made clear his problem is not with
the Iraqi people but with the dictator who created the kind of
problem we have.''

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Will Free Four Hostages;

   Iraq said today it would free four American hostages ``soon,''
and scoffed at reports the captives were being ill-treated.
Washington again demanded the freedom of all the captive
foreigners.
   Aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima, Navy sailors
and Marines held a somber memorial service for 10 mates killed in a
boiler room steam leak. Tuesday's accident was the worst suffered
by the Navy since Operation Desert Shield began in August.
   Iraqi Information Minister Ladif Jassim, at a news conference in
Baghdad today, did not give the names or whereabouts of the four
American hostages to be freed, but said they were elderly and sick.
He did not say when they would be released.
   The Iraqi official repeated the Baghdad government's contention
that the United States was trying to use the hostage issue as a
pretext for a military attack. He insisted they were being treated
well.
   ``All the Americans at sites have complete freedom. They can
watch TV, read books and read newspapers. They also enjoy the
friendship of Iraqi forces,'' Jassim told reporters.
   Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners at strategic
installations as shields against a feared attack. In letters
released today by a .S. official, two of the captives described
their isolation and anxiety.
   ``You can survive. But individually interned, (one) must be
psychologically capable of living alone within himself,'' said one
of the letters.
   It ended with a plea: ``Please do not forget the guest
hostages.'' Iraq refers to the captives as guests.
   The names of the letter-writers were not released for security
reasons. The letters were brought to the U.S. Embassy by
non-American foreigners, said the official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   President Bush, in a speech in Burlington, Mass., said today the
United States and the world community were ``united in anger and
outrage'' at the treatment of hostages by Iraq's ``brutal
dictator,'' Saddam Hussein.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about Iraq's
offer on Wednesday to allow holiday visits by families of hostages,
said: ``Why doesn't he (Saddam) let the hostages come home? That
would be the best way - or better yet, Thanksgiving.''
   Bush said today he still hoped for a peaceful solution to the
gulf crisis, but insisted ``there will be no compromise'' on the
United Nation's demands for a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces
from Kuwait.
   The White House, meanwhile, was silent today on comments made
Wednesday night by Vice President Dan Quayle, who said it was not
enough to force Saddam out of Kuwait. He said the world cannot
allow the Iraqi leader to keep his arsenal of chemical weapons and
ballistic missiles.
   ``We would have to go beyond that if those objectives would be
achieved because you cannot simply allow Saddam Hussein to have
this military power and have the technology into the future,'' the
vice president said in an interview on PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour.
   A Soviet envoy who met twice last month with Saddam says the
Iraqi president is more open to a peaceful settlement than he was
in early October.
   Yevgeny Primakov also said Wednesday that Iraq agreed that 2,500
Soviet citizens can leave Iraq before the end of November. He said
34 Soviet military experts were flying home to Moscow today.
   Meanwhile, a published report today quoted U.S. officials as
saying that if there is an allied assault on Kuwait by sea, Iraq
plans to blow up several oil tankers. The report in the Washington
Times said three tankers are anchored near the Saudi Arabian coast,
and there may be others as well. The information was attributed to
Pentagon, military and intelligence officials, who were not named.
   The offer of holiday visits for the hostages, which came
Wednesday from an Information Ministry spokesman in Baghdad, was
branded by Britain's Foreign Office on Wednesday as ``a cynical
propaganda move.''
   ``It's probably just another psychological ploy,'' said Dawn
Bazner, whose husband, Mark, was videotaped early in the crisis
asking Saddam to let foreign women and children go.
   ``I'm hoping that we won't have to visit (Mark) there ... but if
it comes down to it, I will go,'' she said in Palm Desert, Calif.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt announced Wednesday
that he is traveling to Baghdad next week at Saddam's invitation.
The German government today endorsed the planned trip as ``the most
suitable way'' to try to secure the release of hostages.
   About 400 Germans are among thousands of foreigners stranded or
held in Iraq. Brandt, who won the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize for
helping improve East-West relations, said he was going as a private
citizen and not to represent Bonn.
   Last weekend, European leaders meeting in Rome agreed not to
send envoys to Baghdad to try to secure the release of countrymen,
reasoning that doing so would only help Saddam in his attempts to
divide the anti-Iraq alliance.
   Iraq has been allowing Westerners to leave on a piecemeal basis;
nearly 300 French citizens left on Monday.

   Federal safety officials focused today on
failure of a critical plane engine part as they probed the probable
cause of a crash-landing that took 112 lives at Sioux City, Iowa,
in 1989.
   A metallurgist told the National Transportation Safety Board
that a defect in a critical engine disc had been present ``since
day one.''
   The metallurgist, James Wildy, said a so-called ``Hard Alpha
Defect'', a spot of nitrogen inside titanium from which the disc
was made, was never detected over the life of the engine part.
   He said the defect was located less than an inch from the point
on the disc ``where a defect would be most critical.''
   ``That defect has been in there since day one,'' Wildy said,
referring to the manufacture of the 370-pound fan disc by General
Electric in 1971.
   The fan disc, originally 32 inches in diameter, was recovered in
two pieces from corn fields in Iowa in October 1989, nearly three
months after the accident at the Sioux Gateway Airport near Sioux
City.
   During the board's meeting, members praised the response of the
crew to the engine explosion, which shredded the hydraulic system
of the United Airlines DC-10 jumbo jet, causing crew members to
lose almost all control.
   A board staff member said the flight crew was able to keep
minimal control of the plane by manipulating the two remaining
usable engines in a ``very crude and rude flight control system.''
   ``It was no mean feat,'' said board member John Lauber.
   ``It was in fact, exquisite and resulted in the saving of
lives,'' he said.
   The transportation safety board was to vote later on a report
drafted by its staff after a lengthy investigation into the
disaster.
   The board will vote on the report's conclusions, its finding as
to the probable cause of the accident and its safety
recommendations.
   The crash of United Flight 232 occurred after an explosion in
the tail engine of the DC-10 shredded the plane's hydraulic system,
sending it into a 42-minute spiral during which pilots struggled to
maintain control.
   At a hearing in Sioux City on Oct. 31, 1989, safety board
investigators said they were not ready to conclude that a hairline
crack in an engine fan disk caused the explosion.
   But they acknowledged that a focus of the investigation was the
possibility that a flaw in the disk's metal caused the explosion,
sending pieces of metal ripping through that aircraft's tail
section and severing the hydraulic lines that give pilots control.
   The fan disk from the DC-10's tail engine was found in two
pieces in corn fields near Alta, Iowa, about 80 miles east of Sioux
Gateway Airport, where Flight 232 cartwheeled and burst into flames
as its pilots tried to make an emergency landing.
   In July, the safety board, without concluding what caused the
accident, called on the Federal Aviation Administration and the
engine manufacturer, General Electric Co., to develop new
inspection methods to detect cracks before they reach dangerous
proportions.
   Last March, the FAA sought changes in the DC-10's hydraulic
system to enable pilots to steer the plane even if hydraulic lines
are severed in the plane's tail section.
   Crew members of Flight 232 said that once the hydraulic lines
were cut, their only means of steering the aircraft and controlling
its descent was to selectively accelerate the remaining wing
engines.

<HEAD>Tax Refunds Ordered in KC Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered $10.7
million in tax refunds for property owners in the Kansas City
School District, but only to the 9,000 taxpayers who filed formal
protests.
   The refund involves a property tax increase ordered by U.S.
District Judge Russell G. Clark in September 1987 to help finance
school desegregation.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in April declared the 1987 increase
unconstitutional. Its unanimous ruling said Clark exceeded his
legal authority in directly raising the district's tax rate from
$2.05 to $4 on each $100 assessed value. But it also said federal
judges may order local officials to raise property taxes to help
desegregate public schools.
   The money to be refunded has been held in an escrow account by
Jackson County and will not come out of the district's current
budget or from the state.
   ``I thought that was good for the district, because we don't
have any money,'' said school board President Julia Hill. She
applauded Clark's order implementing the refund. ``That's what the
school board asked for. ... We're quite pleased about that.''
   Clark's refund order, which was dated Oct. 29 but arrived from
his office in Springfield on Wednesday, said refunds would go only
to the taxpayers who followed the protest process required by
Missouri law.
   Homeowners due refunds will receive $37.05 for every $10,000 of
property value.
   Arthur Benson II, lawyer for the plaintiffs in the desegregation
case, said that limiting refunds to the people who protested was
appropriate. He did not protest his property taxes and will receive
no refund.
   He said he was sympathetic to those who failed to protest their
tax payments. ``I'm sorry for them, and I'm sorry they won't get a
refund,'' Benson said. ``But people have an obligation to protest
their rights.''
   Some of Kansas City's largest businesses should receive a big
portion of the refunds. Hallmark Cards Inc., for example, protested
more than $1 million in tax payments.
   Thousands of people also paid their 1988 and 1989 property taxes
under protest, but none of those payments will be refunded, Clark
ruled.
   The Supreme Court ruling held that the method used to set the
district's tax rate in 1988 and 1989, even though it did not rely
on a vote of the people, was constitutional. Because of that, Clark
said, there was no cause to refund those payments.
   On Monday, the Supreme Court let stand a ruling that boosted
Clark's power to order predominantly white suburban schools to
accept inner-city black students. The justices, without comment,
rejected an appeal by three suburban school districts facing such a
desegregation order.

   The former heavyweight champion was questioned by the woman's
attorney about a financial statement putting Tyson's net worth at
$15 million as of Feb. 28.
   Asked how much he earned this year, Tyson said, ``I had a bad
year this year,'' apparently referring to his defeat in February by
James ``Buster'' Douglas.
   The jury awarded Sandra Miller, a 26-year-old computer operator,
just $100 in compensatory damages for the Dec. 10, 1988 incident.
She had sought $1 million. The jury today began a second phase of
the civil trial to determine whether the woman should receive
punitive damages.
   Tyson, who testified earlier during the trial, acknowledged that
he was at the Manhattan disco that night but denied knowing or ever
touching Miller.
   Her lawyers planned to call as a witness today another woman who
has sued Tyson over an allegedly similar incident the same night at
the disco.
   The jury in the civil case deliberated 4{ hours Wednesday before
finding that Tyson grabbed Miller's breasts and buttocks after she
refused his advances at Bentley's Disco in 1988. Tyson had denied
knowing or ever touching Miller.
   The fighter said of the verdict, ``If they thought it was
serious, they would have given her more than 100 bucks.''
   The jury ruled that Tyson committed battery but not assault.
U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey had told jurors that assault
required no finding of contact but must include a threat, while
battery requires actual contact.
   Miller said she felt ``great that they know that he did it.''
   In closing arguments, Tyson's attorney, Robert Hirth, told the
jury that Miller had made up her claims to get money from Tyson.
   ``You should send a message that if Sandra Miller wants to
engage in a get-rich-quick scheme she should buy a lottery
ticket,'' Hirth said.
   Compensatory damages are awarded to compensate victims for pain
and suffering, medical bills and any losses, such as lost income or
a damaged reputation. Punitive damages are awarded to punish the
party responsible.

<HEAD>Government Sets Medicare Hospital Deductible for 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials said Thursday that
Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospitals next year will have to
pay deductibles of $628, which is 6 percent higher than this year's
rate.
   The deductible is calculated according to a formula set by law
and in 1991 will be $36 higher than this year's deductible, said
the Health Care Financing Administration
   Except for the deductible, Medicare pays for all necessary
hospital inpatient services for 60 days. If further hospitalization
is needed, beneficiaries next year will have to pay coinsurance of
$157 per day, $9 more than this year. These coinsurance payments
are required to be one-fourth of the hospital deductible.
   If after hospitalization, extended care in a skilled nursing
facility is required, Medicare pays for all approved services for
the first 20 days. For the next 80 days in such a facility,
beneficiaries will be responsible for $78.50 per day in
coinsurance. That rate is $4.50 higher than the 1990 rate.
   The 1991 monthly premium for Medicare hospital insurance for
those over 65 who have not earned entitlement to it will be $177.
Entitlement is earned through employment under the Social Security
or Railroad Retirement systems.

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush: President Would Consider Meeting With Saddam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE RUFF</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush would consider doing anything,
including a one-on-one meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
to ease tensions in the Persian Gulf, first lady Barbara Bush said
today.
   Mrs. Bush said Americans trapped in Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion are on the president's mind 24 hours a day.
   When asked if Bush would consider meeting face-to-face with
Saddam, Mrs. Bush replied:
   ``I think he would consider anything to get the Kuwaitis back in
their own country, and to get our men out.''
   Mrs. Bush appeared at a news conference to bolster Republican
candidate Ally Milder, who faces Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., in
next week's election.
   Bush, starting a separate six-day cross-country campaign swing,
continued tough rhetoric against Saddam. In a speech to a GOP rally
in Mashpee, Mass., Bush said he was ``more determined than ever''
to drive the Iraqi leader out of Kuwait and that Saddam's forces
were more barbaric than Adolf Hitler.
   In an earlier appearance today in Overland Park, Kan., Mrs. Bush
was asked her feelings on her husband's ``belligerent statements''
about Iraq. ``Isn't that funny because he's just being firm.
There's a big difference,'' Mrs. Bush replied.
   ``I don't think of my husband as belligerent. I think of him as
wise,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush expressed confidence the United States will avoid war.
   ``When you have 24 countries in the world all working for peace
... trying to get something done, I think you will,'' Mrs. Bush
said.
   Later at a speech before a partisan crowd in Omaha, her last
campaign stop of the 1990 elections, Mrs. Bush made a slip of the
tongue.
   She said Ms. Milder is independent and wouldn't vote with Bush
100 percent of the time. ``But I know she's going to vote 100
percent of the time for the people of Oklahoma,'' Mrs. Bush said,
catching herself immediately.
   ``Oh, I knew I'd do that. Last day, last candidate. In Omaha,''
Mrs. Bush said.

   A clear plastic coffin buried under 6 feet
of dirt and wet concrete for a Halloween escape trick collapsed
under the weight and killed the would-be Houdini locked inside with
chains and handcuffs.
   About 150 people, including the magician's children and wife,
watched as aides frantically dug at the dirt and cement to try to
rescue Joseph Burrus.
   ``They attempted to get him out, but it did no good,'' said
Police Lt. Roger Enmark.
   Burrus, a recovering addict, was performing the stunt to benefit
a drug treatment clinic.
   The 3 feet of dirt and 3 feet of concrete were estimated at 9
tons.
   Burrus, who billed himself as ``Amazing Joe,'' said before the
stunt that he considered himself a successor to the great escape
artist Harry Houdini.
   ``I consider myself a master of illusion and an escape artist. I
believe I am the next Houdini and greater,'' Burrus said.
   ``To me, that is what an escape artist is: to put myself in an
impossible situation and get out of it.''
   Burrus was handcuffed and wrapped in chains, locked inside the
coffin, lowered into a 7-foot-deep grave and buried.
   Burrus completed a similar escape last year in Salem, Ore.,
getting out of the coffin through a side panel and digging his way
up through the covering of soil.
   He had said Wednesday's attempt was his first to escape through
a layer of concrete.
   ``He told me he had perfected this act and said he was a
recovering addict and wanted to do this show as a benefit,'' said
Charles Lewis of The Third Floor, a drug rehabilitation group for
which Burrus was doing the stunt.
   After the coffin was lowered into the grave, aides shoveled
about 3 feet of dirt into the hole. A cement truck poured another 3
feet of wet concrete into the grave.
   ``As soon as we finished and the truck pulled away, the whole
thing dropped. The cement busted the coffin. It buried him alive,''
said assistant Sean Henderson.
   ``Immediately everyone went into action to get him out,'' said
Mark Crosse, a photographer with The Fresno Bee. ``I heard cracks.
... Somebody yelled, `get a paramedic' and `does anybody know CPR?'
''
   A backhoe dug a hole alongside the coffin to drain the concrete
while workers frantically shoveled dirt from the grave.
   Burrus was declared dead at the scene, Enmark said.

<HEAD>Albanian Cope With Hardships With Eyes on West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A middle-aged woman pinched her shabby
sweater in a gesture of disgust. It cost half her monthly wage of
about $50.
   A teen-ager wore the same troubled expression in a murky, muddy
alley five minutes' walk from Tirana's showcase Skanderbeg Square.
   ``These are the streets of a capital,'' he sighed.
   After more than four decades of isolationist rule under Enver
Hoxha, the Balkan nation of 3.2 million is slowly opening to the
outside. The glimpses offered are often of hardship and
frustration.
   Official propaganda under Hoxha - who died in April 1985 -
lauded the Communist leader's success in modernizing Albania.
   The Soviets helped until the 1961, when relations were broken
because of Albania's Stalinist and pro-Chinese policies. Sixteen
years later, Albania severed ties with the Chinese.
   Then Albania was largely on its own, importing items such as
East European trucks or discarded West German buses in barter for
exports of chrome, chemicals or produce.
   Progress was made. Albania, without railways in 1944, now has
built up industry, harnessed its mountain rivers for power and
expanded agriculture. Even with a larger education system, children
may still tramp miles to school.
   The economy has a far longer journey to rival even former East
Bloc nations.
   Windows are lacking in homes, schools and dingy buses, lopsided
from decades of use and neglect.
   Factories in towns such as Kavaje, Fier, Patos and Ballsh, all
south of Tirana, seem as if they were abandoned in war. Sometimes,
a glimmer of light or a face at a window reveals that some work is
going on.
   In these cities, most Albanians live in dingy, three-story
apartment blocks. Many of the balconies, festooned with laundry,
are stacked with firewood for winter heat. Cooking is mostly done
by kerosene. Lamps are often just bare bulbs.
   In some cases, the environment has been sacrificed for industry.
   Oil derricks around Qitet i Stalin and Ballsh leak streams of
black oil into the earth around them.
   Lignite mined for heat or power gives the air in Tirana a
choking tang, familiar in many other East European cities.
Industrial emissions spew uncontrolled into the air.
   In towns, one-story dwellings reminiscent of the stone huts seen
in villages often nestle between the blocks. Sometimes they are
surrounded by a walled garden. Sheep or other animals may be
tethered nearby.
   In its efforts to improve daily life, the Communist government
of President Ramiz Alia has begun to allow citizens to sell surplus
produce from homes or collective farms at private markets.
   Prices, however, are relatively high. Meat, often scarce in
state stores, goes for more than $1 a pound.
   Families drag their own sheep or goats to be slaughtered and
cooked at communal bakehouses, where women also arrive with
uncooked cakes for baking.
   Vegetables are generally available around the nation, which has
many sunny, fertile plains. Leeks, spinach, carrots, beans,
shriveled crab apples and eggplants were on sale in late October
from 20 cents to 50 cents for a kilogram, equal to 2.2 pounds.
   Yet even agriculture has been hit hard by this summer's drought,
which Alia admitted in August had cost the equivalent of $20
million in lost power generated by hydroelectricity, and an
estimated $60 million in lost industrial production.
   Western diplomats in Tirana argue that Alia's new course of
``democratization'' in Albania was dictated solely by economic
need.
   When communism fell across Eastern Europe, Albania lost
virtually its only source of barter trade and was compelled to open
up, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign businessmen and experts trickle into Tirana to discuss
helping the economy. American oil experts in the capital in late
Otober said they were impressed with what Albanian experts had
achieved with outmoded equipment, but said foreign help is needed
for progress.
   There is talk in the official media of breaking with one of the
most sacrosanct tenets of Hoxha - the ban on foreign loans - and
indulging in joint ventures. Other articles have relied on more
traditional propaoganda to encourage the people to work harder.
   ``There is no import without export'' is a popular slogan
invoked in this effort. But Soviet toothpaste ($4 a tube), Italian
dishwashing liquid ($2 a bottle) and sunglasses ($15 a pair) among
the only foreign goods seen in stores.
   One way in which Albania could earn foreign currency is through
tourism. Mountains, which cover 70 percent of the country, offer
spectacular scenery and unspoiled wildlife. The Adriatic and Ionian
coasts boast warm beaches.
   Yet the flow of tourists is presently only about 10,000 yearly,
far lower than neighboring nations of Greece and Yugoslavia.
   Hints of the world beyond the borders comes from Yugoslav, Greek
or Italian TV, or the Voice of America radio broadcasts in
Albanian. Prized radio-cassette players offer a chance to play
much-copied tapes of Western rock 'n' roll music.
   Many Albanians see their only hope as leaving. While children
pester foreign visitors for gum or pens, adult Albanians often
murmur ``visa, visa,'' to passing foreigners.
   ``I can stay,'' said a woman at a factory in Tirana.
   She then pointed to her son.
   ``But he, it's better he gets out.''

<HEAD>Thousands Of Romanians Protest Price Increases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with street protests. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Romanians took to the
streets today to protest price rises that doubled or tripled prices
on a wide range of goods.
   About 2,500 demonstrators occupied the main downtown square in
Bucharest and about 10,000 people demonstrated in the central city
of Brasov demanding that a partial deregulation of prices be
rescinded.
   ``They should have made sure products are available before
raising prices,'' insisted one man at the Bucharest rally. ``Their
policy only creates fear.''
   The Commerce Ministry said the new price policy, which
officially went into effect this morning, would double prices for
clothes, public transport and furniture, among other items.
   Essential foodstuffs, energy and rents remained protected for
the time being.
   Romanians appeared increasingly frustrated and confused by the
reforms, claiming they were not adequately informed about them.
Their frustration was compounded by a lack of goods in the stores.
Many shops were closed.
   ``No one has any idea what's going on,'' said one man who was
shopping.
   Protesters shouted slogans accusing President Ion Iliescu and
the government of being crypto-Communists and of unfairly raising
prices under the guise of liberalization.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front, who took power in the
December revolution that ousted Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, promised gradual reforms and social protection. But
after the Front won overwhelmingly in May elections, Roman sped up
the process of reform.
   Both chambers of Parliament resumed a joint session today.
Premier Petre Roman asked the two houses to grant the government
special powers to impose temporary value-added and income taxes by
decree.
   But Finance Minister Teodor Stolojan and Economics Minister
Eugen Dijmarescu, dispatched to parliament to argue the
government's case, encountered opposition. Most of it came from
members of their own National Salvation Front.
   Petrisor Morar, a deputy from the small opposition party
Romanian Unity Alliance, demanded a no-confidence vote against the
government and began collecting the 150 signatures necessary to
hold such a vote.
   He accused the government of ``not providing social protection
against the reforms.''
   Valentin Gabrielescu of the National Peasant Party said his
party would, but the National Liberal Party's Dinu Patriciu said he
would back the government.
   ``It's inevitable that price reforms occur and it will require
sacrifices... Any government would have to do this,'' Patriciu
said.
   Deputy Reform Minister Dorel Sandor said that if the government
fell ``it would only delay the same reforms by a year... (meaning)
a tragedy for the economy.''
   In July, legislation on the sale of failing state-owned
industries was approved. Last month the government slashed their
credits and energy subsidies.
   Roman, who attended a closed-door session of Parliament late
Wednesday to discuss the economic program, was quoted by state
radio as warning the only alternative to a market economy was ``a
return to the past.''
   In addition to the price reforms, the national currency was to
be devalued today by more than 50 percent to help exports. The new
rate was 35 lei to the dollar.
   Under the price increases that were to take effect today, 2.2
pounds of carrots would go from four lei (about 11 cents) to 10 lei
(about 28 cents.) But most food items, energy and rents are to
remain controlled until next year.
   ``I can't force stores to raise prices,'' said Finance Ministry
Price Director Ghoerghe Oana. ``From this point on, factories are
selling at different prices, and this will eventually affect the
consumer. But stores are essentially free to do what they want.''

   Two former co-workers testified today that
Nancy Cruzan, whose seven-year coma has been the subject of a
long-running legal battle, would not want to continue being kept
alive.
   ``I have no doubt,'' Mary Ann Smith of Joplin said when she was
asked by attorney Bill Colby whether Ms. Cruzan would reject all
efforts to keep her alive in her comatose condition.
   Tom Turner, former owner of an Oklahoma City office supplies
store where Ms. Cruzan worked briefly, said in videotaped testimony
that they once talked about the case of Karen Ann Quinlan, who
lived in a similar coma-like condition for nine years after she was
removed from a respirator.
   ``Nancy was very specific about what she would want if she were
in Karen's situation. That was she would not want to be kept alive
under those circumstances. It was almost like she found the thought
of being maintained in a vegetative state unforgivable,
reprehensible or repulsive,'' Turner said.
   Colby represents Joe and Joyce Cruzan, who are seeking to have
their 33-year-old daughter's feeding tube disconnected so she may
die as they believe she would want.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last summer rejected the parents'
request. But Colby said he had new evidence showing that Ms. Cruzan
would want to die. He planned to have three former co-workers
testify in Jasper County Circuit Court. The three have not
previously testified in the case.
   Mrs. Smith, of Joplin, said she and Ms. Cruzan worked as teacher
aides at a private school for severely handicapped deaf and blind
children in 1978 and ``got to be very close.''
   She said they had several conversations about what they would
want their family to do with them if they became as severely
handicapped as some of the children they cared for.
   Mrs. Smith recalled a conversation with Ms. Cruzan and a teacher
in March 1978 while Ms. Cruzan was holding and attempting to feed a
3-year-old girl who was the most severely handicapped child at the
school. Ms. Cruzan was trying to feed the child with a tube
inserted through the throat and into her stomach.
   ``She talked about how pitiful she (the girl) was and she didn't
know she was alive - so severely retarded she could live all her
life and not know the beauty of life,'' Mrs. Smith said.
   She said they talked during a one-hour period about how none of
them would want to be kept on life-support equipment in such a
state. Mrs. Smith said if she were in the girl's condition ``she
would want the plug to be pulled.'' Ms. Cruzan ``shook her head
yes,'' she said.
   ``We were all in agreement. We would not want to put our
families through that,'' she said.
   Colby told the court in his opening statement ``you will find
the Cruzans are almost out of emotions. It's been a long and trying
three years.''
   However, Colby said the family still has ``lots of love'' for
their daughter.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered permanent brain damage when her car
overturned on the road home from work on Jan. 11, 1983. Doctors say
she is incapable of reacting or relating to her environment and can
experience no thoughts or emotions.
   On Oct. 23, Judge Charles E. Teel Jr. dismissed the state as a
party in the case at the request of Missouri Attorney General
William Webster. Webster argued that his involvement was no longer
necessary because the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme
Court have set guidelines on when food and water can be withdrawn
from comatose patients.
   In its first right-to-die decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
5-4 in July that the state could keep a patient on life support in
the absence of ``clear and convincing'' proof that the person would
want to die.
   Ms. Cruzan left no written instructions about what she would
want done under such circumstances. However, her parents and sister
say they know she would have rather died than be kept alive in such
fashion.
   Colby says the testimony by Ms. Cruzan's former co-workers will
meet the ``clear and convincing'' standard.

<TEXT>
   Religious riots sparked by Hindu
fundamentalists' attempt to seize a Moslem mosque intensified
Thursday, and the death toll in nine days of clashes rose to more
than 200.
   News agencies and officials reported at least 31 people died
across the country on Thursday. They were killed in battles between
Hindus and Moslems or when police fired on mobs or when victims
died in hospitals of injuries suffered in earlier riots.
   At least 210 people have died since Oct. 24, when the fighting
began.
   Most of the deaths were in Uttar Pradesh, the state where the
disputed shrine is located, and in Gujarat state. Both states have
a history of sectarian clashes and simmering tensions between
Hindus and Moslems.
   Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state. At least 30
percent of its 120 million people are Moslems. Violence has erupted
in 22 of its 63 districts, according to police officials in
Lucknow, the state capital.
   The disput has also caused riots in neighboring Bangladesh, an
Islamic nation, where Moslem mobs attacked temples and Hindu shops
and homes after hearing of the violence in India.
   At least one person was killed in Dhaka, which is under curfew
along with the port city of Chittagong.
   In Ayodhya, site of the disputed mosque, the bodies of three
Hindus were found Thursday in the Saryu River.
   The victims were apparently killed Tuesday when police opened
fire to throw back Hindus who stormed the mosque, residents said.
At least seven people are previously known to have died in the
police action.
   The discovery of the bodies led to the deployment of extra
government troops around the dusty temple town and forced Hindu
groups to postpone a fresh attempt to storm the mosque.
   But members of the fundamentalist World Hindu Council vowed to
continue their efforts to take over the disputed site. Ashok
Singhal, the council's general secretary, told a public meeting
outside Ayodhya his group would not give up its campaign to replace
the mosque with a temple.
   Singhal is wanted by the police. His appearance at a
well-publicized meeting attended by thousands of people lent
credence to reports that many police officers are sympathetic to
the Hindu movement.
   ``There is no power on earth which can stop us from building the
temple,'' Singhal told the crowd. ``There is no place for Islam in
our nation.''
   Singhal, who wore a bandage around his head, sustained injuries
during Tuesday's attack on the temple. He later slipped away from
the hospital where he was treated.
   The World Hindu Council says the 460-year-old Babri mosque is
built over the birthplace of Lord Rama, one of the most revered
Hindu gods.
   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence last
year when the group first announced its intention to take over the
site by force.
   The dispute has threatened to bring down Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's 11-month-old government. A pro-Hindu party, which had
supported the government coalition, withdrew its backing two weeks
ago when its president was arrested while leading a march to drum
up support for the temple construction.
   In another political development Thursday, the Congress Party of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi supported the government of
Chimanbhai Patel, a member of Singh's National Front coalition, in
a vote of confidence in the Gujarat state assembly.
   Patel's government had been reduced to a minority after the
Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support in line
with its decision to jettison the National Front coalition in the
federal Parliament.
   Congress Party leaders in New Delhi defended the decision by
saying they were willing to support the National Front - but not
Singh. They have said the party will oppose Singh in the Nov. 7
confidence vote - but could support a National Front government if
Singh were replaced as prime minister.
   Political commentators and newspapers have attacked Singh for
what they call his vacillation on the temple-mosque dispute, saying
it is the greatest threat to India's political system since the
country became independent in 1947.
   India is predominantly Hindu and all its prime ministers have
belonged to the majority community, but tolerance of all religions
and secularism is a part of its constitution.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people and
Moslems comprise 12 percent of the population. The others include
Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists.

<TEXT>
   Plymouth High School students digging for
a time capsule buried by the Class of 1980 found a practical joke.
   Instead of finding the red tube that had been buried Oct. 31,
1980, they uncovered a note and a map in a glass jar.
   ``Better luck next time,'' the note uncovered Wednesday read.
``The Warriors. Dec. 20, 1980.''
   Principal Brad Turson remembers the Warriors as a group of
students who hung around together during the late 1970s.
   The map in the jar led students to the front corner of the
school building where the time capsule had been reburied.
   Inside were predictions and notes on life in Plymouth by

the capsule opening but couldn't recall what his capsule entry was.
   It was a prediction that the United States would be at war with
Iran.
   The students replaced it Wednesday with their own time capsule,
to be dug up Oct. 31, 2000. It includes forecasts for the year 2000
of a cure for cancer, a woman president, a national deficit in the

ownership of most of America's businesses, a World Series for the
Cleveland Indians and a Super Bowl for the Cleveland Browns.

<HEAD>Stop the Madness: Actor Brad Dourif Wants to Play a Real Person</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actors often complain they never get a
serious role. But Brad Dourif would like a role that's, well, less
serious. A little more stable, anyway.
   Dourif began his film career in the role of mentally deranged
Billy Bibbit in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
   After playing an obsessed rat exterminator in ``Graveyard
Shift'' and a drifter in ``Sonny Boy,'' Dourif says he's ``playing
another crazy person'' in the current filming of Werner Herzog's
``Scream of Stone.''
   But Dourif is campaigning for sane roles now. He was called to
play the killer in ``Grim Prairie Tales,'' but held out, and is now
playing an East Coast writer whose stories are highlighted in the
film.
   Another role as a romantic lead in ``Hidden Agenda'' is helping
Dourif fulfill his goals as an actor.
   ``I wanted to get the girl and make the big bucks, like
everybody else,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reports Slight Drop in Iraqi Armored Vehicles in Kuwait</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has removed about 300 armored vehicles
from Kuwait while adding more artillery pieces in the occupied
Persian Gulf nation, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said that Defense Department
analysts see little significance in the changes. He noted that an
estimated 430,000 Iraqi military personnel are still in and around
Kuwait - the same number as a month ago.
   ``It doesn't change their posture, which is primarily one of
defense'' with the capability to switch to an offensive campaign,
Hall said.
   The spokesman said the Pentagon estimates that Iraq now has
2,200 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles in
Kuwait and southern Iraq, compared with 2,500 before.
   The number of Iraqi artillery pieces in the area has risen from
1,700 to 2,200, Hall said, while the Iraqi tank count remains at
3,500. The United States has at least 220,000 military personnel in
the gulf, plus about 800 tanks.
   Hall said he could not comment on Bush administration plans to
send additional forces to the gulf. He said any announcements would
come only after the deployments were under way. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said earlier this week that the U.S. flow of military
personnel to the gulf would continue, possibly adding as many as
100,000 forces.
   Hall also said the aircraft carrier USS Midway had arrived in
the north Arabian Sea in the last few days, bringing the number of
U.S. carriers in the region to four.
   Hall declined to discuss the movements of other U.S. warships in
the area, but the Navy said recently that the carrier USS
Independence was due to leave the area soon and that the Midway
would be its replacement.

<TEXT>
   A group of anti-abortion Republicans led by
Phyllis Schlafly said Thursday it will ask GOP officeholders to
sign a pledge reaffirming the party's stand against abortion.
   The undertaking by the newly formed Republican National
Coalition for Life is designed to counter efforts by another group
whose members advocate abortion rights and a change in the plank
the party has adopted in its last three national platforms.
   ``The purpose of our committee is to make sure the party does
not abandon its principled stand,'' Mrs. Schlafly, president of the
conservative Eagle Forum and a director of the new group, said at a
news conference.
   She said more than 100 GOP officeholders already have signed the
pledge to reaffirm the plank and support Republican candidates
opposed to abortion.
   ``To be effective, elected officials must no longer waffle or be
wishy-washy on their pro-life convictions,'' said Beverly LaHaye,
president of Concerned Women for America.
   The National Republican Coalition for Choice, formed last year,
supports candidates who favor abortion rights and advocates a
change in the party platform, which states: ``The unborn child has
a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.''
   In 1989, Democrats running for governor and lieutenant governor
of Virginia, governor of New Jersey and mayor of New York won on
abortion rights platforms against GOP candidates who had
anti-abortion records but tried to moderate their stance.
   The national party has said it welcomes pro-choice candidates
despite its stance in the platform.
   Mrs. Schlafly said the new group isn't supporting candidates in
Tuesday's elections, but that it likely would form a political
action committee to support anti-abortion Republican candidates.
   ``What we want to say is that you make a great mistake when you
abandon your position,'' Mrs. Schlafly said. ``Look at the way
George Bush has fallen in the polls when he retreated from his
`Read My Lips' pledge (against a tax increase). It's a loser.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush: President Would Consider Meeting With Saddam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush would consider a one-on-one
meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if that would ease
tensions in the Persian Gulf, first lady Barbara Bush said
Thursday.
   Mrs. Bush said Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq are on
Bush's mind 24 hours a day.
   When asked if Bush would consider meeting face-to-face with
Saddam, Mrs. Bush said:
   ``I think he would consider anything to get the Kuwaitis back in
their own country, and to get our men out.''
   Thousands of troops have been sent to the Persian Gulf since
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. U.S. citizens and others who were
in Iraq and Kuwait at the time have been held captive by the
Iraqis.
   Mrs. Bush said she hoped and prayed that force would not be
necessary in the crisis.
   Mrs. Bush appeared at a news conference to bolster the
congressional campaign of Republican Ally Milder, who faces
first-term Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., in next week's election.
   Mrs. Bush said she didn't even know Hoagland's name. ``That's
how much of a mark he's made in Washington, incidentally,'' Mrs.
Bush said.
   Later at a speech before a partisan crowd, her last campaign
stop of the 1990 elections, Mrs. Bush said Ms. Milder is
independent and wouldn't vote with Bush all of the time.
   ``But I know she's going to vote 100 percent of the time for the
people of Oklahoma,'' Mrs. Bush said, catching herself immediately.
``Oh, I knew I'd do that. Last day, last candidate. In Omaha.''
   After Mrs. Bush's talk, Ms. Milder presented her with a red
Nebraska football team sweatshirt for the Bush's dog, Millie.
   The sweatshirt's back read: ``Millie for Milder.''
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Bush was campaigning in Utah, where
Republican congressional hopeful Genevieve Atwood assured her that
she supports the president ``down to my underwear,'' even though
she opposed a federal budget bill.
   Atwood is challenging incumbent Democrat Wayne Owens in Utah's
2nd District.
   After Atwood introduced the first lady and said she was a
``George Bush supporter right down to my underwear,'' Mrs. Bush
replied, ``I can hardly wait to get back and tell George about
that.''

<HEAD>Greenspan Asked To Reduce Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic leaders called on Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Thursday to show his support for a
recently enacted budget compromise by reducing interest rates.
   ``The American families that will endure the hardship of deficit
reduction now merit the rewards of lower interest rates and
continued employment,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Budget Committee, said in a letter to Greenspan.
   A driving force behind yearlong efforts to cut the deficit was
an expectation that credit markets and investors would be convinced
it would reduce government borrowing and ease pressure on interest
rates.
   Gephardt said the agreement, which is expected to reduce the
deficit by $490 billion over five years, provides the deep,
enforceable cuts that Greenspan and others had recommended.
   ``Having honored our commitment to a sound national economy, we
now ask that you provide the agreement with the endorsement that
financial markets seek,'' the lawmakers wrote. That endorsement
would be shown publicly, they continued, ``by allowing an easing of
credit conditions in the United States.''
   Gephardt and Panetta said a one-quarter-point reduction in
short-term rates announced earlier this week ``sends an ambiguous
message to the markets and would limit the benefit of the
deficit-reduction package on our economic growth.''

   American consumers' debt binge during the
1980s increases the likelihood the next recession will be long and
deep, a liberal policy research group said Thursday.
   ``If we do experience a recession, its impact will be much more
severe than if consumer debt were at a lower level,'' said
University of California-Riverside economic professor Robert
Pollin.
   Pollin's study, ``Deeper in Debt: The Changing Financial
Condition of U.S. Households,'' said Americans' debt, compared with
their disposable income, was at a post-World War II high of 93.9
percent in 1988. In the mid-1970s, the ratio hovered around 75
percent.
   The debt overhang will cause consumers to cut back spending even
more sharply than they would otherwise in an economic downturn,
deepening any recession, said the report, prepared for the Economic
Policy Institute, a liberal think tank financed partly by labor
unions.
   Any added pressure on consumers is particularly significant
because their spending amounts to roughly two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity as measured by the gross national
product.
   Mortgage foreclosures and personal bankruptcies already have
been increasing during the past decade and would rise even higher
in a recession, the study said.
   All this would add to the pressure on the financial system,
already troubled by the collapse of the savings and loan industry
and a high rate of bank failures, it said.
   Banking regulators, who have vigorously urged institutions to
use greater care in making real estate and corporate buyout loans,
have remained relatively quiet about consumer lending.
   However one regulator, Comptroller of the Currency Robert
Clarke, warned bankers in January about an increase in sour
consumer loans.
   Economist Robert Dugger of the American Bankers Association
suggested the effects of any consumer retrenchment would ripple
through the economy unevenly.
   Manufacturers of luxuries would be hit harder than companies
making necessities, he said. Also, people would default on
unsecured credit card loans before falling behind on their
mortgages.
   ``The credit situation of average- and moderate-income
households is more fragile than it has been for years. Fragility,
however, doesn't mean that it's going to break,'' he said.
   Bank data shows that lenders and borrowers already are
exercising greater caution, he said. Outstanding consumer and home
equity loans totaled $427 billion at the end of June, down $6
billion from six months earlier.
   Consumers tend to compensate for drops in income by borrowing
more. For instance, inflation-adjusted, after-tax personal income
in September fell 0.3 percent in September, but real spending rose
0.3 percent, according to the Commerce Department.
   Consumers did that by dropping their savings rate to a
three-year low, but that can only go on for so long.
   Pollin disputed what he said were several widely-held notions
about why consumer debt is increasing. The buildup is notthe
result of a consumption binge, nor did it occur because the Baby
Boom generation entered its prime borrowing years, he said.
   Most Americans - except for the wealthiest 20 percent - have
needed to borrow more in order to maintain their living standard in
the face of stagnating income and rising housing costs, he said.
   Although it is true that younger people borrow more heavily than
people nearing retirement, older Americans also increased their
borrowing in the 1980s, he said.

<HEAD>Curfews Imposed on Townships To Curb Black-on-Black Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police placed hundreds of
thousands of blacks under curfew Thursday, surrounding their
townships with roadblocks under new restrictions intended to curb
black-on-black fighting.
   The leader of the black opposition Inkatha Freedom Party,
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said the violence was the major obstacle to
negotiations to include blacks in a new constitution.
   But a spokesman for the African National Congress, Inkatha's
main rival, denounced the government measures as a ``high-handed,
bully-boy action'' and said they would only lead to more bloodshed.
   Buthelezi met with President F.W. de Klerk as part of the South
African leader's effort to begin talks with black opposition groups
on ending apartheid. Factional fighting between Inkatha and the
ANC, led by Nelson Mandela, has slowed efforts to begin the
negotiations.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said late Wednesday the
recent violence had made it ``necessary to introduce extraordinary
measures'' in three townships outside Capetown - Khayelitsha,
Crossroads and Lingulethu.
   Similar restrictions were lifted from 11 townships around
Johannesburg where fighting has died down.
   Vlok declared the Capetown townships ``unrest areas'' and said
police would use their expanded powers to prevent violence.
   The restrictions give police wider powers to prevent
demonstrations and other forms of protest but are not as broad as
those in effect during a nationwide state of emergency that was
lifted in June.
   Reinforcements were called in from Pretoria to enforce the
measures, which included a 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew that began
Thursday. Officers set up barriers at the entrances to the
townships and searched cars.
   ``The police have information of further planned violence
coupled with intimidation ... and protest marches,'' Vlok said.
   In Cape Town, ANC spokesman Trevor Manuel said the actions would
only further anger residents and that violence would not end unless
town councilors in the townships step down.
   The recent conflict has been beteen anti-apartheid groups and
the local town councilors. Many anti-apartheid militants see the
black councilors as collaborators with the white-led national
government.
   The Cape Town townships had been relatively peaceful until two
weeks ago, when the wife of a leading anti-apartheid militant in
Khayelitsha was slain. Since then, clashes have broken out
involving the militants and supporters of the town councilors.
   Unrest in the Johannesburg townships has been more along tribal
lines, with supporters of the Zulu-based Inkatha party facing off
against Xhosas and other blacks linked to the ANC. Both groups
oppose apartheid but differ on tactics to fight it and on their
vision of a future South Africa.
   Restrictions were lifted Wednesday on 11 Johannesburg townships,
where more than 800 blacks died in violence in August. The measures
were kept in effect in Soweto, the biggest township, where at least
16 people were killed in unrest this week.
   In Natal province, meanwhile, where thousands of blacks have
died in factional fighting, a regional Inkatha leader was
critically injured Thursday after a bomb exploded in his car,
police said. Lancelot Ntombela was driving in Greytown when the
device went off, officials said.
   Also Thursday, police announced the arrests of five white men
believed tied to right-wing organizations. The men have not been
charged, but are being investigated for the possession of illegal
weapons and possible links to recent violence, the independent
South African Press Association reported.

   A mansion built for a woman who admitted
embezzling millions of dollars from Citibank may soon be home to
the former head of a collapsed guarantor of student loans.
   Richard C. Hawk, president and chairman of the Higher Education
Assistance Foundation in Overland Park, confirmed Wednesday he
plans to buy the Colonial-style house, dubbed ``Tara'' by
neighbors.
   U.S. Department of Education officials, who have asked Hawk to
resign, say the foundation this year guaranteed more than $1
billion of the country's defaulted student loans.
   Hawk has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the collapse of the
company, but federal officials said Hawk was responsible for ``bad
business decisions.''
   Hawk said he expected to move into the house by December.
   The house, in Hallbrook Farms, one of the area's most exclusive
residential communities, was built for Becky and Peter Schafer, a
Nebraska couple who bought it with money Mrs. Schafer embezzled
from her employer, New York-based Citibank.
   Citibank took possession of the house in August after Mrs.
Schafer was arrested and charged. She pleaded guilty to
embezzlement last month for taking at least $3.5 million.
   ``I saw the house for sale, and I made an offer,'' Hawk said.
``My wife and I happen to like Colonial-style homes.''
   The house, which cost $1 million to build, has marble floors,
custom-made stairwells and leaded-glass doors.
   Hawk is paying $900,000 for the house, according to unidentified
sources quoted by the Kansas City Star.
   Hawk said Wednesday his foundation guaranteed 40 percent of the
$2.1 billion in student loans Citibank had outstanding last year.
He said the purchase was not connected to his work at the
foundation or its dealings with Citibank.
   ``HEAF is a non-profit organization and does not constitute what
might be considered my net worth,'' Hawk said. ``If the only thing
I was involved in was HEAF, I wouldn't have the capital to purchase
the home in Hallbrook. That should be obvious.''
   A Citibank spokesman declined to comment.

   Rep. Raymond J. McGrath, R-N.Y., was
discharged from the hospital Thursday, one week after he was
stricken with a blood clot in his lung, according to a spokesman.
   ``He went home with his wife,'' said Dan Zielinski, McGrath's
press secretary. ``He's under strict doctor's orders to get plenty
of rest.'' The congressman has a home in the Maryland suburbs, as
well as on Long Island, N.Y.
   McGrath is planning to go to New York on Sunday and hopes to
make some campaign appearances, Zielinski said.
   ``He realizes he's missed quite a bit during the last week and
he wants to do as much as he can.''
   McGrath is still taking blood-thinning drugs and has to have his
blood checked daily for the next week to make sure no new clots
appear, Zielinski said.
   McGrath was hospitalized after becoming sick at his Capitol Hill
office Oct. 25. After a series of tests, doctors at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center diagnosed a pulmonary embolism, or a blockage
in a blood vessel in the lung.
   McGrath, 48, of Valley Stream, is running for a sixth term from
a heavily Republican district in Nassau Count. He is being
challenged by Democrat Mark Epstein, an environmental lawyer.

<TEXT>
   Nawaz Sharif, the architect of ousted
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's stunning election defeat, was
poised Thursday to head Pakistan's fifth freely elected government
in 43 years.
   Sharif, a wealthy 41-year-old industrialist with humble
beginnings, was nominated by the right-wing Islamic Democratic
Alliance to be the next prime minister.
   But a militant group in Ms. Bhutto's home province of Sind
warned his election would bring protests and demonstrations.
   Sharif led his party to a landslide victory over Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party in the elections on Oct. 24, winning 105 of
the 217 seats in the National Assembly, the policy-making lower
house of Parliament.
   The assembly, scheduled to convene Saturday, will elect the
prime minister by secret ballot, but the vote is seen only as a
formality.
   The battle for the prime minister's chair was expected to be a
hard-fought contest between Sharif and Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, the
caretaker prime minister since Ms. Bhutto's government was ousted
on corruption charges three months ago.
   Jatoi reluctantly bowed to Sharif, who offered him any Cabinet
post he wanted. The offer was declined.
   ``I'm not a job hunter,'' Jatoi said after a coalition meeting
that ended his brief tenure.
   Throughout Ms. Bhutto's 20 months in power, Sharif governed
Punjab province, the powerhouse of Pakistan politics and home to
about 60 percent of the country's 110 million people.
   Shortly after Ms. Bhutto became prime minister in December 1988,
Sharif organized 18 diverse parties into a coalition that became
known by its Urdu-language intials of IJI. It had one goal: to
bring down Ms. Bhutto.
   Twice, Ms. Bhutto and Sharif tried but failed to oust each
other.
   Ms. Bhutto governed until President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed
her on Aug. 6 for corruption, incompetence and abuse of power,
charges she steadfastly denies.
   With the 37-year-old former premier and her party effectively
weakened, many are now questioning whether the alliance of such
diverse ideologies will hold together. Ms. Bhutto predicts its
collapse within six months.
   Sharif's government will face daunting problems on all fronts.
   Tensions with its eastern neighbor, India, continue to smolder
over disputed Kashmir, while a military and political stalemate in
Afghanistan, Pakistan's western neighbor, drags on and prevents the
return of some 4 million refugees.
   The economy is on the verge of collapse, facing $2 billion in
lost revenues from the Persian Gulf crisis. Washington has
suspended nearly $600 million in economic and military aid because
of suspicions about Pakistan's nuclear program.
   Although he has little experience in national government,
supporters say Sharif is conscious of his weak spots and willingly
accepts advise.
   Sharif's political career was launched in the early 1980s when
the army ruled Pakistan.
   He is more in tune with the urban middle class than the landed
families who have ruled Pakistan since its creation in the 1947
partition of the Indian subcontinent. He is seen even by the
country's left as a break from tradition and a catalyst that could
end feudal control in Pakistan, where more than three-fourths of
the people are landless, illiterate and earn less than $400 a year.
   He is seen as a man of humble beginnings who worked hard to gain
support.
   His family's multimillion-dollar steel foundary was launched by
his father from an oven in a ramshackle building in the heart of
Punjab. The business expanded and then diversified to include sugar
and textile mills and now employs about 10,000 people.
   Sharif, often described as shy, appears uneasy when asked about
his family or their personal wealth. ``Certainly not as rich as the
Bhuttos,'' he once replied when asked to estimate his wealth.

<HEAD>I Was Right, Former East German Leader Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former East German leader Erich Honecker says in a
published interview that his countrymen are becoming aware of the
rights and social services they have lost, and he predicted that
communism will recover.
   ``In the end I will be seen to have been right,'' Honecker was
quoted as saying in Friday's edition of The European newspaper.
   Honecker, interviewed in his small flat in a Soviet military
hospital compound outside Berlin, expressed no fear of facing
criminal charges.
   ``I am not afraid of a show trial. I consider all the charges so
far brought by the prosecutor's office untenable,'' Honecker was
quoted as saying.
   ``I also reject responsibility for the figure, cited by the
prosecutor's office, of 200 killed on the GDR (East German)
borders. I have no personal guilt for that. And what, I ask myself,
about those who killed GDR border guards while violating our
frontiers?''
   The European said Honecker was interviewed by Heinz Judge, a
comrade of Honecker in the anti-Nazi resistance.
   Honecker, whose Communist regime was toppled in October 1989,
said it had been ``a great disappointment for me that so many
people have forgotten socialism and turned to the D-mark instead.''
   ``But I am not afraid that former GDR citizens would threaten me
or lynch me, despite the demonstration cries and banner slogans of
the so-called `Democrats.' Quite the contrary; in the end I will be
seen to have been right.
   ``It has already become quite obvious to all what rights and
social services they have lost,'' Honecker said.
   He contended that the Communist parties of the old East Bloc had
been brought down by intrigues, but that they could bounce back.
   ``What is needed now,'' Honecker was quoted as saying, ``is a
merciless investigation of the reasons for what has happened and
the relevant conclusions to be drawn. The Communist movement has
certainly suffered a defeat but it will recover.''
   He offered no apologies for his years in power.
   ``Everything I did, I did in the knowledge that I was doing
something for the people and for peace. In the present situation
they need scapegoats and I am being made the biggest one.
   ``My wife and I are shocked by the allegations and calumnies
against us. We are accused of corruption and self-enrichment at the
expense of the people. But Margot and I have nothing to reproach
ourselves with. We did not lead a life of luxury and we do not have
a bank account in Switzerland.
   ``We are well enough looked after here by our friends. At least
my medical treatment is looked after.
   ``But my wife and I do not understand why a basic constitutional
right in the GDR is denied us - that is, the right to a proper
apartment of our own.
   ``We do not ask too much and want no privileges. All we want is
a perfectly normal flat like all other citizens here.''

<HEAD>Los Angeles Basin Residents Breath Easier as Ozone Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the Los Angeles region
breathed easier during the summer of 1990 because ozone pollution
dropped to its lowest level in more than 40 years and smog alerts
declined 60 percent this year.
   Thanks to strict auto and industrial emissions standards and
favorable weather, the ozone level during the May-to-October smog
season was down 24 percent from the period last year.
   ``This is mind-boggling,'' Joseph Cassmassi, senior
meteorologist with the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
said Wednesday. ``When you compare it with the past, it's like
night and day. There's really been a dramatic improvement.''
   Ozone, released when the sun heats certain airborne pollutants,
is a powerful lung irritant. It is especially harmful to children,
people with respiratory disorders, the elderly and people who
exercise outdoors. However, in the upper atmosphere it shields the
Earth from the sun's harshest ultraviolet radiation.
   Alerts for high levels of ozone were issued in at least one of
the region's cities on 41 days, records show. That compares with 54
days in 1989 and 77 in 1988. Going back to 1977, smog days occurred
three times as often.
   Compared to the May-October period of 1989, there was a 60
percent decline in the number of hours that the region exceeded the
Stage 1 level of smog containing .20 parts per million of ozone or
more, Cassmassi said.
   In addition, the ozone problem from year to year has been
shrinking in duration as well as the number of days, the data
shows.
   The management district last year adopted a plan aimed at
eliminating Stage 1 alerts by the year 2000. The plan increases
emissions controls for cars and industry, and regulates various
household products and even charcoal lighter fluid.
   The lower pollutant levels were not apparent to the casual
observer. Haziness produced by a mixture of soot and moisture
continued to turn the horizon a dull brown, officials said.
   ``We can get ozone to zero and the public might not even notice
it because they gauge air quality by visibility,'' said district
chairman Norton Younglove.
   Ozone levels peak from May through October because of strong
sunshine and stagnant air that traps pollutants close to the
ground.
   A 24 percent ozone reduction should produce health benefits,
said Dr. Robert Phalen, director of the Air Pollution Health
Effects Laboratory at the University of California, Irvine.
   ``People with lung disorders would notice that this was an
easier year for them,'' Phalen said. ``And those of us who don't
have a lung disorder are benefiting even though we don't notice it
because smog episodes slowly erode lungs.''
   However, Dr. Ray Casciari, a physician in Orange, said he has
seen no improvement in the health of the estimated 2,000 lung
patients his office treats annually. But he said his patients have
severe ailments, and ``all they need is one sudden bad exposure''
to require medical care.
   ``We're encouraged, but it's still flat out awful,'' said Tim
Little, executive director of the Coalition for Clean Air, a Santa
Monica environmental group. ``It doesn't show enough of a decline
to even put us in the same league with the rest of the country.''
   Cassmassi said 75 percent of the improvement in air quality is
the result of lower emissions and 25 percent a consequence of the
weather.
   The biggest emissions drops traditionally have come from
turnover of automobiles. Two million new cars are purchased each
year in California. New cars must meet stricter emissions standards
that reduce pollutants by 90 percent compared to 15 years ago.
   Reductions also come from controls on heavy polluters such as
oil refineries and aerospace plants. The controls were enacted
years ago but some are only now being enforced.

   A van carrying a college choir group and
driven by a student overturned Thursday on Interstate 65, killing
one student and critically injuring at least three others, police
reported.
   Witnesses said the van, carrying 11 students from Olivet
Nazarene University in Kankakee, Ill., was southbound on I-65
northwest of Indianapolis when it edged off the shoulder of the
pavement.
   The driver apparently over-corrected and the van then entered
the median, flipping over several times before coming to rest in
the northbound lanes, witnesses said.
   The driver was an Olivet Nazarene student, said school spokesman
Gordon Wickersham.
   Several students were thrown from the rear doors, which flew
open. The student who was killed apparently suffered a head injury
when he landed on the pavement. Most of the students landed on the
grassy median, witnesses said.
   Three students were in critical condition at Home Hospital in
Lafayette with head injuries, said hospital spokesman Mike Adler.
Seven others were treated at St. Elizabeth Hospital, spokeswoman
Joanne Willis said. She would not release their conditions.
   No charges had been filed.
   The driver, who was pinned in his seat for about 20 minutes
before being freed, was wearing a seat belt. Two other students who
also were wearing seat belts suffered minor injuries.
   Olivet Nazarene spokesman Gordon Wickersham said the students
were members of the 63-student Orpheus Choir, which was on its way
to Indianapolis for an appearance this weekend.
   ``They are all responsible students. I know every one of them,''
he said.
   The choir director, George Dunbar, and the 52 other students
were passengers on a bus traveling in front of the van.
   Wickersham said the choir's appearance in Indianapolis was
canceled.

   An honor guard fired a 21-gun salute and
a lone bugler sounded taps at a memorial service Thursday honoring
10 U.S. sailors killed in a steam burst aboard the USS Iwo Jima.
   About 1,000 servicemen, including Marines in battle dress and
sailors in dungarees, snapped to attention during the tribute. They
stood motionless on deck, moving only to wipe away a tear or bow
their heads during the 40-minute ceremony.
   A table set up on deck served as an altar, with a cross flanked
by two candles. In front was an officer's cap, a seaman's round hat
and a folded U.S. flag.
   ``The price of freedom is high,'' said Vice Adm. Henry H. Mauz
Jr., commander of the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. ``The
standards we live by have never been more clear, and have been
defined by our fallen shipmates. May God bless them and keep
them.''
   The sailors died following an accident Tuesday in the boiler
room aboard the Iwo Jima, an assault ship that is a helicopter
launching pad for a U.S. Marine force.
   The ship was leaving port at Bahrain when steam heated to 850
degrees burst through a pipe, Navy officials said. The cause of the
accident is under investigation.
   Six of the crewmen died instantly, and four others died later
aboard a hospital ship. Their bodies were shipped back to the
United States for burial.
   Reporters and photographers were not allowed aboard ship for the
memorial service, but they were briefed later and shown Navy
videotapes.
   ``We lost 10 very good friends,'' said Petty Officer Robert
Jones. ``It doesn't seem like any period of time can heal the
wounds that were inflicted on us. ... I know for myself, when they
died, a part of me died with them.''
   Capt. Michael O'Hearn, a Vietnam veteran and the ship's
commanding officer, delivered a eulogy and urged the crew members
to honor their fallen mates with their work.
   ``Our resolution to go on and restore this ship and ourselves,
so that we can restore our combat readiness, is within itself a
tribute to our fallen shipmates,'' O'Hearn said.
   Chaplains read verses during the service, which included a taped
version of the National Anthem and the singing of the Navy hymn.
   The boiler room accident brought to 43 the number of American
deaths in Operation Desert Shield. More than 220,000 American
troops have been deployed since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Before Tuesday's accident, the Navy had lost one sailor who was
electrocuted in August aboard the cruiser USS Antietam.
   The Iwo Jima, whose home port is Norfolk, Va., has a crew of 685
and a complement of 1,100 Marines.
   A psychiatric team was sent to the Iwo Jima to help the crew
deal with the emotional scars of the accident.
   The Navy has more than 50 ships deployed in the Middle East
region.
   ``We know it's a dangerous job,'' said Master Chief Dan
Titsworth, 42, who serves aboard the guided missile cruiser USS
Biddle in the Red Sea. ``It's one of the things we live with.''

<HEAD>Voters Could Restore Sweeping Shelter Measure For The Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeless advocates predict that District of
Columbia voters on Tuesday will restore one of the nation's most
comprehensive homeless shelter laws, which was gutted because of
city budget woes.
   The city council, fighting a $100 million budget deficit, scaled
back the 1984 law earlier this year amid complaints that housing
the homeless has grown too expensive.
   Homeless advocates argue that costs have risen because city
shelters are run inefficiently. The advocates gathered petition
signatures from 43,000 voters to place a referendum on the ballot
for Tuesday's election.
   It would reinstate the requirement to provide emergency
overnight shelter to anyone who requests it.
   ``I think we're going to win, maybe by a small margin, but we
are going to win,'' said Carol Fennelly of the Community for
Creative Non-Violence. ``The people of this city still want the
district to do the right thing.''
   A poll in June showed support for such a ballot proposal at 71
percent. But an economic downturn has advocates worried that the
referendum won't gain sweeping support.
   ``We live in a time right now where people feel a certain amount
of economic instability themselves,'' Fennelly said. ``Even though
some of these people may now realize they are one or two paychecks
away from homelessness, the tendency may be to be conservative.''
   Democratic mayoral nominee Sharon Pratt Dixon and Maurice
Turner, her Republican counterpart, oppose the measure.
   Homeless advocates got a boost last week from a judge. A
temporary restraining order now bars the district from distributing
anti-initiative literature that had been printed with taxpayer
money.
   ``That they have the audacity to print this material, and use
tax dollars to defeat something that voters say they want, shows
how the city feels about this,'' said Susie Sinclair-Smith,
director of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless. ``They
have been trying to dismantle the program all along.''
   The district government has wasted money by housing the homeless
in expensive hotels, says Fennelly. Mayor Marion Barry showered
lucrative overnight shelter contracts on friends and campaign
contributors, Fennelly and the late Mitch Snyder have said.

<HEAD>Police Minister Orders Changes After Temple Mount Shootings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head f Israeli police said Thursday the
force will be reorganized following last month's killing of 20
Palestinian protesters at Jerusalem's Temple Mount.
   Police Minister Roni Milo would not say whether he would fire
senior officers. Few other details about the plan were immediately
available.
   Near Tel Aviv, a Palestinian stabbed his former Israeli employer
10 times. It was the latest incident of violence between Jews and
Palestinians since the Oct. 8 Temple Mount shootings.
   A three-member commission appointed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir concluded police shot in self-defense, but criticized senior
commanders for ignoring advance warnings of the trouble.
   A statement from Milo's office said the changes were drafted
``after studying the ... committee report, its decisions and
recommendations.'' Israel Army Radio said the reorganization will
take effect in about two months.
   Under the changes, Israeli media said Jerusalem would become a
separate police district, rather than being part of the Southern
District. The other districts include Tel Aviv, Central and
Northern.
   The reports said Milo would not fire senior commanders, but
delay promotions or urge early retirement.
   There are between 16,000 and 17,000 police officers in Israel,
including paramilitary border police, said police spokeswoman Ruth
Shlezinger.
   Following the stabbing attack, police arrested 20-year-old Ahmed
Hamad Azufi from Gaza's Rafah refugee camp at an army roadblock in
Gaza. The victim, workshop owner Shlomo Shtezi, was in stable
condition at Wolfson Hospital near Tel Aviv late Thursday.
   Police also rounded up about 200 Arabs working in Rishon Lezion
factories after the stabbings.
   Police said the assailant slept overnight in the workshop in
Rishon Lezion near Tel Aviv, where he had been employed for a short
period until three weeks ago.
   ``The assailant fled, leaving his shoes behind. The victim
managed to get to a phone to call his wife, even though he dripped
blood throughout the factory,'' district police commander Hezi
Ledder told Israel television.
   Ledder said Shtezi was stabbed after a work-related discussion,
but denied this was the reason for the attack.
   Police spokesman Eli Maimon said investigators classified the
stabbing as a ``nationalist crime'' related to the Palestinian
uprising.
   Since the Temple Mount incident, three Israelis and two Arabs
have been killed in attacks.
   Also Thursday, Israeli warplanes blasted guerrilla targets in
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. It was the 16th such attack of the year.
   The army did not identify the targets, but Israel army radio
said a 1989 raid in the same village struck a base operated by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
headed by Ahmed Jibril.
   In other developments Thursday:
   -The army said 24-year-old Mohammed Rashad Jerusi from the West
Bank refugee camp of Tulkarem died after being shot by troops in
clashes Wednesday. His death brought to 770 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israelis during the 34-month uprising.
Another 293 Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of helping Israel. Fifty-one Israelis have also died in
the violence.
   -Flight information monitors broke down at Israel's
international airport and more telephones went unrepaired as a
strike by 120,000 government technicians entered a third day.
   -Officials reported that 21,744 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel in
October, setting a record in the current Soviet immigration wave.

<TEXT>
   House Republicans trying to capitalize on
anti-Congress feelings across America unveiled a television spot
Thursday accusing lawmakers of voting themselves a tax cut in the
just-completed budget deal.
   The problem is, it's not true.
   Like as many as 4 million other Americans whose incomes are in
the range of $100,000 to $200,000, members of Congress will see
their top tax rate drop from 33 percent to 31 percent.
   But also included in the package was an increase in the tax
those same people would pay to support Medicare, more than wiping
out the income tax cut.
   In addition, taxpayers in that bracket would lose some or all
personal exemptions and some itemized deductions.
   One analysis by the Senate Budget Committee found a typical
married member of Congress with two children would pay 3.8 percent
more in total federal taxes under the new law.
   House members are paid $96,600 a year, but their salaries will
increase to $124,424 next year.
   The GOP television spot, which will run nationally on Cable News
Network this weekend and on local channels in three targeted
congressional districts, contends ``the average congressman will
have their income taxes cut by $3,500.''
   ``Most Democrats voted to raise their taxes and cut their own,''
the ad contends. ``Most Republicans voted against the tax increase
and against the tax cut for congressmen.''
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the GOP House
campaign committee, said he hopes the attack on Congress will hurt
Democratic incumbents in Tuesday's elections.
   The TV spot does not mention that President Bush, who is
stumping for GOP candidates, was instrumental in engineering the
tax package, or that it is part of an effort to cut the nation's
out-of-control deficit by $496 billion over the next five years.
   The three districts where the GOP is paying to run the spot
locally are the Second District in Utah, where Democratic incumbent
Wayne Owens is in a tight re-election race; Cincinnati's First
District, where Democratic incumbent Rep. Thomas Luken is retiring
to make way for his son, Mayor Charles Luken, who faces a dead-heat
race with former Mayor Ken Blackwell; and the Illinois 16th, a GOP
district being vacated by Republican Rep. Lynn Martin.

   Patrick Loughlin's father was a Teamster who
taught him early in life that a decent living depends on a high
school diploma or a union card.
   Loughlin opted for the latter when he was a teen-ager whose
family needed money. He joined the Newspaper Pressmen's Union, one
of nine unions striking the Daily News.
   ``I would have a job for life, I figured,'' Loughlin said.
   Since 1947, Loughlin, 61, has worked for three newspapers that
folded. He's hoping the Daily News, which is mired in a strike,
doesn't become the fourth.
   ``I've always made a good living,'' Loughlin said Wednesday.
   ``I went into the service, came back and I had a job waiting for
me. My seniority was protected, everything was protected through
the auspices of my union and their agreements with management,'' he
said.
   As the strike against the News marks its first week, Loughlin
doubts whether the nine unions on picket lines can reach new
agreements with the newspaper.
   ``It's as if they're saying to you: `All the things you've done
and all the things you've gotten over the years are no longer
there. So start from Page 1 again,' '' Loughlin said.
   Loughlin, married and the father of two daughters, said he got
his union permit for his 18th birthday.
   ``I paid $3 a month to the union and that guaranteed me some
kind of standing on the line,'' Loughlin said.
   ``You would show up and state to the foreman that you were
available and they would put you on a list. And if there was work -
and there was at that time - they put you to work.''
   He got his junior pressmen's card while he was in the military,
serving in Korea. In 1960, he became a journeyman pressman.
   The job wasn't glamorous.
   ``You work nights. You work Saturday and Sunday. And you had to
wait a long while to get different days off, vacations,'' Loughlin
said.
   It was dirty.
   ``You have to be willing and able to get covered head to foot
with ink mist and paper dust and oil spinning off the presses.''
   And it was loud.
   ``In the middle of that room, with all those presses running,
it's like standing at 42nd Street in the subway with all the
express trains going through without stopping, continuously.''
   The union made it bearable by winning decent wages, hours and
benefits for its members and their families, Loughlin said.
   Loughlin said he plans to retire next year. Because of his
seniority, he expects he'll find enough work until then, even if
the News shuts down. But the prospects of younger pressmen aren't
as good, he said.
   ``Some people will get some work at the New York Times and the
Post,'' he says. ``The majority of them ... I don't know what
they're going to do. Many of them will lose their homes, their
plans for their children's education will have to be changed.''
   Local 2 of the pressmen's union has dropped from more than 3,000
members in the mid-1960s to about 900 members now as newspapers
closed and others automated. If the News closes, another 400
members will be out of work.
   Loughlin said he will stick with the strike to the end. He's not
very optimistic about how it will end.
   ``I don't see too much future,'' he said. ``I know we're in for
hard times, no matter what happens.''

<HEAD>Bank Of Finland Halts Soviet Trade Following Ruble Devaluation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Ruble, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of Finland halted trade with
the Soviet Union on Thursday because of confusion over exchange
rates set by the Soviets, the central bank announced.
   The bank did not publish its usual quotation for the ruble and
the Finnish mark, meaning there was no official basis on which to
exchange the two currencies.
   ``To put it mildly, we are somewhat unsure of what is going
on,'' said Kari Holopainen, director of Soviet trade at the Bank of
Finland.
   On Thursday, the Soviets adopted a new exchange rate for
commercial transactions that is nearly 70 percent lower than the
official rate. The move was designed to make Soviet exports more
competitive while discouraging imports.
   Holopainen said central bank officials were not informed by the
Soviets which of three ruble exchange rates now in effect applied
to the ``clearing ruble'' used in Finnish-Soviet trade.
   ``In any case, we have stopped all payments in the
clearing-house trade with the Soviet Union for the time being,'' he
said.
   Under arrangements dating to World War II, three-quarters of
Finnish-Soviet trade is conducted by barter through a clearing
house, with cash accounts used to smooth out inequitis. Although
barter with the Soviet Union represents only 11 percent of Finnish
total foreign trade, 90 percent of Finland's oil comes from Soviet
sources.
   Central bank officials said they believed it was the first time
since the war that trade between the two countries was stopped.
   Finnish-Soviet trade totaled 16.7 billion marks, or $4.6
billion, in the first nine months this year, Holopainen said. The
currencies had been exchanged recently at rates near 6.5 marks to
one ruble.
   Earlier this year, officials announced the two countries would
scrap their barter arrangement and conduct trade on a conventional
basis. The Soviet Union trades mostly raw materials for Finnish
industrial and wood products.
   The barter system has already been eroded by trade with
exchangeable currencies. Finnish-Soviet barters accounted for 26
percent of Finland's foreign trade in the early 1980s, compared
with the present 11 percent level.
   Finnish officials said recently the Soviet Union owed Finland
about $1.9 billion in exchangeable currencies.

   Two men have been executed in Shanghai and five
others sentenced to death for murder, rape and armed robbery, an
official newspaper reported.
   Convicted murderer Wang Weiqian and armed robber Tang Shuigen
were executed Tuesday, Shanghai's Wenhui Daily reported in its
Wednesday issue.
   The report, seen Thursday in Beijing, did not give any other
details about the executed men. Executions in China are by a single
bullet to the back of the head and are usually carried out shortly
after sentencing.
   The Shanghai Intermediate People's Court sentenced to death Tie
Huaqing, a factory worker, and Yang Renjie, unemployed, the paper
said. The two killed a man, taking his gold ring, gold bracelet, a
large sum of Chinese and Hong Kong currency and other items worth
thousands of dollars, it added.
   Also sentenced to death, it said, were Yan Tinggui, a sales
clerk, for five armed robberies and two rapes; Jin Shijian, who
raped two women; and Sha Zhide, unemployed, who killed a nurse and
set her home on fire.
   According to official reports, nearly 800 people have been
sentenced to death so far this year as part of an anti-crime
campaign begun in May.

   Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC
leader Nelson Mandela, was fined $80 on Thursday after pleading
guilty to failing to pay unemployment insurance for workers at her
fish-and-chips shop.
   Charges were filed after Mrs. Mandela failed to pay
contributions to the unemployment insurance fund from January to
August. Mrs. Mandela's attorney, Ismail Ayob, produced a receipt in
court Thursday showing the insurance had since been paid.
   A warrant for Mrs. Mandela's arrest in connection with the case
was issued last month after she missed an Oct. 25 court appearance.
Ayob told the magistrate the summons was served at the
fish-and-chips shop but that Mrs. Mandela had not been there for
some time and never received it.
   The magistrate accepted the explanation.
   Mrs. Mandela is scheduled for trial in February on kidnapping
and assault charges involving the abduction and beating of four
young men in December 1988. One of the four was found dead. Mrs.
Mandela has denied wrongdoing.

   The military plans to form eight press pools of
six journalists each if combat begins in the Persian Gulf, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman said Thursday.
   ``In the event of hostilities, if they occur, we have a plan in
place which we are continually refining,'' Pete Williams said.
   Williams, the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs,
launched the Pentagon's national press pool four days after
President Bush committed troops to Saudi Arabia in August.
   The pool was disbanded about three weeks later after Saudi
officials began to allow more journalists into the country.
   During military operations, a press pool is a representative
band of reporters who are escorted to a military area and then
return to share information with reporters left behind at a press
center.
   As many as 400 foreign journalists have been in Saudi Arabia to
cover the U.S.-led military buildup since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. There are about 180 journalists in the country now,
Williams said. Two-thirds of them are from the United States.
   President Bush increased his verbal attacks on Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein this week. The president's spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, said Bush is trying ``to prepare the American people for
any eventuality.''
   ``We will not rule out the military option,'' Fitzwater said in
Washington Thursday.
   Williams said the leaders of Operation Desert Shield may begin
testing how quickly press pools can be mobilized in Saudi Arabia.
During the tests, reporters would be trained to use equipment that
protects them from chemical weapons, which Iraq has stockpiled, he
said.
   ``We think it's essential if we take pools out that we give them
chem gear, flak jackets and helmets,'' Williams said.
   He outlined the pool plans to conferees attending the Associated
Press Managing Editors convention.
   Williams made his comments during a panel discussion of the pool
operations. Also participating were John King, a Washington-based
reporter for the Associated Press, and Kevin Merida, assistant
managing editor of The Dallas Morning News.
   King was in the pool that went to Saudi Arabia in August. Merida
was in the pool that covered the Panamanian invasion in December.

<HEAD>Americans Get Tips on Sending Goodies to Troops in Mideast</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department is offering tips on
a toll-free hotline about sending home-cooked food and other
goodies to the troops in the Mideast.
   ``The most important thing to remember is don't send foods that
are perishable or can't tolerate rought handling,'' hotline
supervisor Sue Templin said Thursday.
   Temperatures in Saudi Arabia are cooling somewhat, with daily
averages of 78 degrees Fahrenheit in November and 70 degrees in
December, but potential food spoilage is always a problem, she
said.
   Hotline home economists worked with USDA food scientists, the
military and the U.S. Postal Service on a list of things to do and
not do.
   Most importantly, don't send fresh meat.
   ``Stick to dry beef, like beef jerky or beef slims,'' she said.
``Canned meats, including chicken and tuna are okay, but high
temperatures may reduce quality.''
   Templin said it would be a good idea for families to remind
troops not to eat foods that arrive in damaged or swollen cans.
That often is a sign of food poisoning organisms.
   Also, don't send high-moisture baked goods, such as pumpkin
bread, because those are susceptible to mold. Pork and pork
products, along with alcohol, are taboo in Saudia Arabia for
religious reasons.
   Fragile good such as delicate cookies won't survive the trip
intact. And products containing chocolate can melt in high
temperatures.
   Foods recommended by hotline people include dense and dry baked
goods, such as fruit cakes, commercially packaged cakes and cookies
in tins, dry cookies like ginger snaps, and crackers.
   Others on the send list, include: raisins, apricots and other
dried fruits, along with canned nuts and fruit, and commercially
prepared trail mix. Jams, jelly and peanut butter packed in jars
also can be included, along with hard candies and candy-coated gum.
   Specialty items like instant soup, fruit drink mixes and
commercially packaged popcorn in tins are others.
   ``Some regional favorites like Texas hot sauce and Cajun
seasonings are being sent to troops, and that's a great idea, as
long as they aren't perishable and can handle transport and heat,''
Templin said.
   For more advice on shipping food and other food safety issued,
the USDA hotline is available at 1-800-535-4555 weekdays from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time. Residents in the Washington, D.C.,
area should call 202 447-3333.

   A dozen youths, some wearing Halloween masks,
screamed ``trick or treat'' before attacking a homeless settlement
with bats, pipes, knives and meat cleavers, killing one man, police
said Thursday.
   Nine people were injured.
   ``Why did they do it? It was Halloween,'' said a policeman close
to the case who would only speak on condition of anonymity. ``Last
night, things just got out of hand.''
   A 35-year-old homeless man, whose name was not released while
police searched for relatives to notify, had his throat slashed and
was pronounced dead at the scene, said a police spokeswoman,
Officer Janice Swinney.
   The wooded area where the attack occurred ``looked like a horror
movie, it was in the dark, down a little path,'' the police source
said.
   The gang, which police said consisted of 10 to 12 people,
crossed a footbridge at 102nd Street in Manhattan into Ward's
Island on Halloween night.
   Ward's Island is home to the Fire Department training academy,
several psychiatric hospitals and a sewage disposal plant. It lies
beneath the Triborough Bridge in the East River.
   ``They went armed with meat cleavers, bats with nails in them,
and pipes. They were going to do serious damage,'' the source said.
   The gang walked to the homeless settlement, where at least one
of the gang members screamed out ``trick or treat,'' followed by a
epithet, before the group began attacking the homeless men, the
source said.
   ``There was no rhyme or reason to it, other than out and out
violence,'' he added.
   The gang also robbed two or three of the homeless men of about
$10 to $15 in pay they had received for performing minor chores.
   ``It was a mixture of payday and Halloween,'' the source said.
   ``Gettin' paid'' or ``payday'' is a street term used by roving
gangs who rob people.
   The gang escaped after the attack.
   Five of the injured homeless were treated at a hospital and
released. Three others were treated by police at a precinct house,
and another man was listed as stable at Harlem Hospital after he
was beaten about the face with a baseball bat.

<HEAD>Rwanda's Government Claims Victory Over Invading Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The central African country of Rwanda
claimed victory Thursday, saying loyalist troops had defeated
rebels who invaded from Uganda a month ago.
   The announcement created overnight street celebrations in Rwanda
as army troops started returning to the capital, Kigali, according
to state radio and a Western diplomat.
   ``The armed struggle is over with Rwandan forces being
victorious against the rebels,'' the government said in a
nationwide broadcast. ``Citizens applauded the Rwandan soldiers all
the way from Kagitumba to Kigali.''
   Kagitumba is the border post through which the rebels,
predominantly members of Rwanda's minority Tutsi tribe, invaded
from Uganda Sept. 30. The rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front accused
President Juvenal Habyarimana's single-party government of
corruption and say they want to replace it with a democracy.
   The broadcast said the Rwandan forces had waged a 36-hour
offensive Monday and Tuesday to retake Kagitumba.
   The insurgents emerged from a 250,000-strong population of
Rwandan refugees in Uganda. They were among hundreds of thousands
of Tutsis who fled Rwanda when the majority Hutu seized control in
the late 1950s and early 1960s in a bloody power struggle.
   Reporters were taken to the border area of Gitumba on Wednesday
to witness what the radio described as Rwandan troops ``ejecting
the nation's enemies.''
   The broadcast quoted civilians who said the rebels had retreated
to Uganda, taking livestock and at least one young Rwandan girl.
   Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, who has condemned the
invasion waged primarily by Ugandan army deserters, repeatedly has
said his nation's borders were closed to the insurgents and that he
would arrest any who tried to return.
   ``Museveni is a man of his word and he said if the rebels return
to Uganda he will put them in jail,'' said the Western diplomat.
``What we don't know is whether the Ugandan government has arrested
them.''
   There also were reports rebels could be hiding in Rwanda's
Kagera National park, which borders Uganda and Tanzania to the
east.
   ``What we know is that the face-to-face war is over. There is no
rebel army,'' said the diplomat.
   Talks reportedly had been taking place between Rwanda's
government and the rebels in Zaire under the mediation of President
Mobutu Sese Seko.
   ``If there is no rebel army, what are they talking about?'' the
diplomat said.
   The rebels reportedly were led by a former Ugandan deputy army
commander, Maj. Gen. Fred Rwigyema, a Tutsi of Rwandan origin.

   Haitian refugees jammed into an overloaded sailboat
told rescuers that 10 passengers were thrown overboard before a
patrol found the survivors Thursday, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
said.
   The Haitians were battling each other when the cutter Northland
pulled alongside about 6 a.m. just 20 miles north of Haiti, said
Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis.
   ``They were fighting not with us, but among themselves,'' said
Karonis, who added it was not immediately known what sparked the
fighting or the alleged drownings.
   Ninety-four people were packed into the 45-foot boat, and
examinations showed many had cuts, bruises and broken bones. They
also suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition.
   The refugees told interviewers that several healthy people, none
wearing life jackets, had been thrown off the boat about six days
previously. Four nights later, some sick and dying passengers were
reportedly tossed overboard as well.
   The Haitians supplied the names of their missing boatmates and
the people who allegedly threw them into the ocean, but Karonis
said the Coast Guard could not independently confirm the drownings.
   ``We don't have any way of proving it,'' he said. ``But there
have been other incidents.''
   Up to 60 Haitians were thrown from a boat on its way to the
United States in one 1985 incident, and up to 100 people were
drowned in another, according to in investigation by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   All the Haitians intercepted Thursday will be brought back to
Port-au-Prince on Friday, Karonis said.
   Reports on the case have been turned over to the U.S. Embassy in
Haiti, he added. He said he did not know if or when the alleged
culprits would be arrested, but said none were taken into custody
aboard the Northland.

<HEAD>Commission Says No Evidence That Speculators Causing High Oil
Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodities Futures Trading Commission
said Thursday that, contrary to White House assertions, there is no
evidence speculators are responsible for the recent escalation and
volatility of oil prices.
   Commission officials told the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee that producers, refiners and end users such as airlines
account for 85 to 90 percent of the trading in crude oil futures on
the New York Mercantile Exchange since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``If anything, it (speculation) has been at an unusually low
level,'' said Commissioner William P. Albrecht. ``Speculative ...
activity in these markets has actually fallen from pre-invasion
levels in terms of market share.''
   Albrecht said a review of daily trading between July 30 and Oct.
9, when prices peaked at $40.42 a barrel, shows that cash market
prices for oil equalled or exceeded increases in prices on the
futures market.
   Meanwhile, he said, oil prices have risen more in foreign
markets than they have in the United States. For example, while the
price of West Texas Intermediate exactly doubled on both the cash
market and the Merc, prices for North Sea oil on the London market
increased 115 percent.
   Claiming there is no shortage of oil, the Bush administration
has repeatedly blamed speculators in the futures markets for the
spiraling prices since the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait cut off
4.3 million barrels per day - or about 8 percent - of the world's
supply.
   ``Frankly, there just is no way to justify price increases from
$24 to $39 a barrel ... except through speculation of futures
buying,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in
September.
   However, Albrecht, citing Energy Department figures, said the
high prices reflect a daily shortfall in world production of 3.4
million barrels a day in September and 1.1 million barrels in
October despite increased production by Saudi Arabia and other
exporting countries. The Energy Department predicts that a daily
shortfall of at least 350,000 barrels will continue through
December.
   ``More recently,'' he said, ``concerns about the possibility of
military hostilities and the effect this might have on oil
production facilities and the future supplies of oil seem to have
been the primary factor underlying rising and falling prices.''
   For example, prices fell by more than $5 a barrel on Oct. 22
when newspapers carried reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
had a dream about settling the controversy. And they jumped $1.83 a
barrel Wednesday upon President Bush's claim that Iraq was starving
U.S. hostages and that he's ``had it'' with Saddam.
   ``Energy industry participants, particularly refiners, do not
want to risk being caught short of oil in the event of further
supply disruptions resulting from hostilities in the Persian
Gulf,'' said Albrecht.
   ``Consequently,'' he said, ``their ... buying activity has bid
up the prices of near-term oil. We have observed no excessive or
suspicious concentrations of trading or positions. Nor have we
found evidence of threatened or actual manipulations.''
   Private analysts, meanwhile, repeated their assertions that
Bush's reluctance to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve early in
the crisis is responsible for oil prices going above $25 a barrel.
   ``The high prices are attributable to the failure of government
energy policy, not organized commodity markets,'' Philip Verleger,
an oil market analyst with the Institute of International
Economics, told the committee.
   Bush could have saved the world's consumers about $40 billion by
pumping 500,000 barrels of oil a day from the emergency government
stockpile into the market in August and September, Verleger said.

   Asked about Saddam's offer to permit families of the hostages to
visit thekm during Thanksgiving and Christmas, Bush said, ``I see
it as a ploy,'' and said the visits should take home in the United
States after the hostages are freed. ``I don't think he'll win the
humanitarian of the year award for that,'' he said, reiterating
government advice that Americans not travel into Iraq or occupied
Kuwait.
   Bush said he was speaking out so forcefully about the Persian
Gulf so the American people would know where he stood after a month
in which attention was diverted to budget deliberations with
Congress.
   ``They must know how strongly I feel'' about the hostages and
the treatment of the American diplomats who have been holed up in
the U.S. Embassy for several weeks, he said.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Fitzwater said the recent switch
in emphasis had ``nothing to do'' with political motives or the
beating Bush had taken in public opinion over the recently
concluded budget battle with Congress. He said Bush was speaking
more often and more forcefully about Iraq ``to prepare the American
people for any eventuality.''

   Global production of cocoa beans in the
1990-91 marketing year is forecast at 2.39 million metric tons,
about the same as last season, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said that would be
about 3 percent below the record 1988-89 harvest of 2.47 million
tons.
   ``Larger crops are expected for Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia,
while most West African producers are anticipating smaller outturns
because of less favorable growing conditions,'' the agency said in
its report.
   Production in the Dominican Republic is also expected to be
down, following a bumper 1989-90 harvest.
   ``Low world cocoa prices are discouraging most growers from
making new plantings and providing adequate cultural practices to
existing trees,'' the report said. ``However, world production
still remains at high levels, as a significant number of young
trees are reaching their maximum bearing age in the Cote d'Ivoire
and Malaysia, in addition to new plantings coming into bearing in
Indonesia.''
   World inventories of cocoa probably will be close to a record
1.5 million tons by the end of the 1990-91 marketing year next
Sept. 30, the report said.

<TEXT>
   A parliamentary by-election is being closely
watched for signs of voter attitudes toward Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu's leadership and his proposal to send Japanese soldiers
abroad for the first time since World War II.
   Kaifu, who has never had a strong power base in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, has been on shakier ground in recent
weeks because of parliamentry opposition to his plan to send troops
to the Persian Gulf.
   The proposal, known as the U.N. Peace Cooperation bill, would
permit dispatching members of Japan's Self-Defense Forces for
non-combat roles only.
   The Socialist Party, Japan's leading opposition group, is
seeking to make the dispute a central issue in Sunday's election of
a legislator to Japan's upper house of Parliament. The election is
in Aichi in central Japan, Kaifu's home base.
   ``A loss in his own prefecture would undoubtedly cast a shadow
of questions on his leadership and harm his image,'' said Toshihiko
Kurachi, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party in
Aichi.
   Kaifu was chosen last summer to head the party and become prime
minister when senior party leaders with stronger backing were under
a cloud because of money and sex scandals.
   His clean image and oratorical skills helped him win popular
support, and his party won lower house elections in February. But
senior party leaders also viewed those elections as giving them a
clean slate, and Kaifu's public support has eroded amid the troop
controversy.
   Japan's post-World War II constitution bans the use of force to
settle international disputes. The opposition parties, which
control the upper house, insist this rules out sending Japanese
troops abroad. Kaifu does not have solid support on the question
even within his own party.
   Kaifu proposed sending troops in September after international
criticism of Japan's failure to provide more than financial backing
to the U.S.-led international force arrayed against Iraq in the
gulf. Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Socialist Party spokesman Osamu Yamaguchi said the group was
urging Aichi voters ``to show what the nation thinks about
dispatching the Self-Defense Forces.''
   Takeshi Kataoka, a lower house legislator from Aichi who is a
member of the governing party, said his constituency's overwhelming
opposition to sending troops to the gulf would not necessarily be
reflected in a vote against the party.
   ``People know the law is not going to lead to the draft as the
opposition claims,'' Kataoka said.
   The Chunichi Shimbun, a newspaper in Aichi's major city of
Nagoya, said that a voters' poll showed 63.9 percent of respondents
oppose sending troops. The poll also indicated much lower voter
interest in Sunday's election than in nationwide upper house
elections last year, when an unpopular sales tax and scandals
affecting the governing party helped the opposition win control of
the house.
   As a result, it is unlikely that Kaifu's government can win
passage of the bill to send troops before the current session ends
on Nov. 10.
   The national newspaper Asahi Shimbun said a poll of 396 of the
511 lower house members showed 223 opposed as long as the bill
provides for sending troops abroad.
   A majority in the poll, however, favored other steps to assist
in Middle East peace efforts, such as financial backing or help for
refugees, the Asahi said.Japan already has pledged $4 billion.

   Fisher-Price is recalling about 60,000 of its
Carriage Strollers, Model No. 9121, because they have been known to
collapse with children in them, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Thursday.
   In some cases, the side tubes don't slide properly when the
stroller unfolds. This can prevent the locking mechanism from
engaging fully, leading the strollers to collapse. Fisher-Price
said it is aware of 23 injuries to children using the strollers,
ranging from bumps and bruises to one broken arm.
   The strollers have been sold nationwide since June 1989, for
about $120 to $140.
   Consumers who own this stroller should call Fisher-Price,
toll-free, at 1-800-527-1034 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily, in
most time zones. However, consumers in Alaska and Hawaii should
call between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Pacific Time.)
   Fisher-Price will send consumers a prepaid mailing package with
instructions to return a wheel from their stroller. Those who
return a wheel will receive a new Carriage Stroller free of charge.
The new stoller will be modified to assure the locking mechanism
will engage fully.
   Consumers should not return strollers to the store where it was
purchased.
   Fisher-Price, of East Aurora, N.Y., is no longer manufacturing
or selling this product.

<HEAD>Peru's Government Launches First Birth Control Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peru's government began distributing free and
subsidized birth control pills and condoms on Thursday, marking a
new era in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation.
   Since it was announced on Oct. 23 by President Alberto Fujimori,
the birth control program has been harshly criticized by the
Catholic Church. Fujimori has strongly defended the plan.
   ``There is nothing terrible in not wanting more children eating
trash in the streets,'' Fujimori said in a speech on Wednesday.
   He said the program was part of his government's efforts to
``combat the principal elements that generate unemployment, poverty
and hunger.''
   Press reaction to the plan has been largely positive.
``Fujimori's birth control proposition may soon become a national
consensus,'' said an editorial in the magazine Caretas.
   Once a virtually taboo subject, birth control in the past week
has become the national rage. Newspapers publish guides to devices
and methods. Radio talk shows have become moral battlegrounds.
Condoms are now a staple of political cartoons.
   Pills and condoms have been available for years in private
pharmacies. But public discussion of birth control has been minimal
and sex education programs are almost non-existent.
   A Health Ministry spokesman confirmed Thursday that the devices
were being distributed by clinics throughout Peru.
   Health Minister Carlos Vidal Layseca, dubbed the ``minister of
condoms'' by the press, said last week the $1.2 million program is
supported by the United Nations.
   In five years, the government hopes to raise the percentage of
Peruvian women who understand birth control methods from 28 percent
of the population to 45 percent, he said.
   The fight marks the second time the Church has strongly
criticized Fujimori.
   Fujimori's political party is largely composed of members of
Peru's small evangelical sects, and the Catholic Church launched
numerous attacks on the president in the weeks before he was
elected June 10.
   About 95 percent of Peruvians are Catholic, although Peru has no
official religion.
   The birth control battle has become largely a debate over how to
eliminate poverty in Peru, where over half the population of 22
million is poor. The country is suffering from its worst economic
crisis this century.
   In announcing the plan, Fujimori said there was ``still time''
to avoid a population explosion in the country. But Peruvians
``must take corrective measures, planning without fears or
taboos,'' he said.
   He said his birth control program would cut annual population
growth from 650,000 people to 360,000 within 10 years.
   ``It's very strange the government is worrying about children
who have yet to be born and not about those who were already born
and who are dying because of poverty and sickness,'' Monsignor Luis
Bambaren said after the plan was announced.
   Monsignor Ricardo Durand Flores, president of the Peruvian
Episcopal Conference, said birth control would lead to more
``sexual excess, sexual licentiousness.''
   This in turn would lead to the use of abortion ``as a means of
birth control,'' he said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's allies in the
national legislature warned opposition groups Thursday against
holding counter-demonstrations on Revolution Day in Red Square.
   ``We should be careful not to let this holiday be darkened by
conflicts or clashes,'' Anatoly Lukyanov, speaker of the national
Supreme Soviet, warned in an interview on the nightly newscast
Vremya.
   The resolution by the legislature's presidium, run by Lukyanov,
was not a formal ban on counter protests. But it increased the
pressure on an opposition coalition that called this week for an
``alternative'' rally Nov. 7 to protest the official parade. The
call led to speculation of clashes with police.
   The parades celebrate communism and the ascent of the
Bolsheviks, now called Communists, in 1917. They were turned into
rolling displays of weaponry by Josef Stalin and traditionally also
include a ``people's demonstration'' of the city's residents.
   While the official ideology has fallen from its sacred position
in recent years, the parades carry great weight in the country as a
symbol of Communist authority.
   The liberal mayors of Moscow and Leningrad last month called for
a boycott of the parades. Many of the 15 republics, including the
secessionist Baltic states and restive Caucasus republics, voted to
ban parades in their capital cities.
   However, Gorbachev last month issued a presidential decree
ordering the parades to be held in most major cities across the
country, and the national Supreme Soviet approved a special
resolution echoing his order.
   The state-run press has quoted generals as saying they planned
to cary out Gorbachev's order in their cities, and Moscow's
Communist Party leaders also promised to hold the traditional
parade.
   A poll published Thursday night indicated most Muscovites were
against the celebration. A survey of 2,222 people in Moscow from
Oct. 27-28 by the independent All-Union Center for Public Opinion
found 29 percent supported the parade but 56 percent were against
it, according to the independent news agency Interfax. The rest
said they were unsure.
   The poll, which gave no margin of error, said elderly people and
people without college educations were more likely than younger
people and college graduates to support the parade as a celebration
of the revolution, Interfax said.
   The resolution Thursday urged the opposition to hold its
counter-demonstration on any day other than Nov. 7-8, the official
dates of the anniversary.
   Soviets should ``celebrate the major state holiday in an
atmosphere of calm, consolidation and cooperation between all
public forces in the country,'' the resolution said, according to
the official news agency Tass.
   Lukyanov, in an apparent effort to de-emphasize the communist
aspect of the parade, added in the television interview: ``They
ought to let this celebration be held as a holiday for national
consolidation.''
   Gorbachev, speaking to a group of students Thursday in the
Kremlin, also called the holiday a ``global event'' and said he
thought most of the country would celebrate the anniversary, Tass
reported.
   However, plans for the parades were being assailed from all
sides.
   The Ukrainian pro-independence group Rukh said Thursday it
planned an anti-Communist protest next Wednesday.
   A leader of the Russian nationalist organization Pamyat said
Thursday his group would not mark the anniversary of a revolution
that ``has led to a complete disintegration of the great state and
to the murder of our legitimate Monarch,'' according to the
independent Postfactum news agency.
   On May Day this year, another major Soviet celebration, tens of
thousands of people marched in a mass counter-demonstration passed
through Red Square, many jeering Gorbachev and shouting ``Resign!''
He withstood the catcalls for 20 minutes before leaving the
reviewing stand.

<HEAD>Survey: Public Health Programs Lagging Behind Recommendations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Compliance with recommendations to the states on
how to improve public health is lagging, a survey released Thursday
showed.
   The survey of health officials from all 50 states was conducted
to determine how well they are implementing recommendations from
the Institute of Medicine, a government advisory group on public
health.
   The officials were in near unanimous agreement with many of 25
proposals they were asked about, but fewer than half had
implemented the recommendations, the federal Centers for Disease
Control said in a report on the survey, conducted by an
organization of state health officials.
   For example, 48 of 50 state health departments agreed their
agencies should ``link with mental health services to improve the
integration of service delivery.'' Only 13 had implemented such a
plan. Eighteen said they planned to do so.
   All 50 state agencies agreed the public should be better
educated on community health needs and policy issues, but only 34
had a program in place to achieve that goal.
   Forty-five of the agencies surveyed agreed they should develop
comprehensive strategies to influence health-related behavior, but
only 21 had implemented a plan.
   A recommendation that state health departments should be
concerned with the public's exposure to toxins won unanimous
agreement from the agencies. Only 33 had implemented a plan.
   The Institute of Medicine said it made the recommendations
because shortcomings in the nation's public health system,
including inadequate resources and weak leadership, limited
availability of effective preventive health services in the United
States.
   Dr. Arthur Liang, a CDC epidemiologist who wrote the agency's
report on the survy, said implementation has been slow in part
because of a lack of government money.
   ``Some of it may be that we as a nation haven't come to grips
with what we expect of public health,'' he said.
   The recommendations were made in 1988. The survey was conducted
in 1989 by the Association of State and Territorial Health
Officials.
   The CDC said legislation has been proposed to increase financial
support to state and local health agencies to help them achieve
public health objectives by the year 2000.
   Implementation of the recommendations wasn't so bleak in some
areas.
   For instance, 49 state health departments agreed that food
protection is a job for the agencies and 48 had such programs in
place.

<HEAD>Many School Children Drink lead-Contaminated Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite laws aimed at reducing lead in
drinking water, federal investigators believe hundreds of thousands
of children continue to drink lead-contaminated water at school.
   An internal report by the Environmental Protection Agency said
that states have failed to enforce requirements that schools test
drinking water for lead and that the EPA has not provided adequate
guidance on what water coolers pose a health risk.
   Lead is a powerful poison. Even traces can be particularly
harmful to children because it can hurt development of the brain
and nervous system. Children under 7 are considered to be
particularly vulnerable.
   Auditors in the EPA's inspector general's office estimated that,
based on a limited survey, fewer than half of the school districts
in the country may be testing thoroughly.
   An examination of 13 school districts in the mid-Atlantic region
revealed that three had not tested for lead while most of the
others conducted inadequate tests.
   ``Our findings confirm that harmful amounts of lead exist in the
drinking water provided by schools. Both the EPA and the states
must be more aggressive in eliminating the health hazard imposed by
lead in drinking water,'' said the report from the inspector
general's office, made available by the agency Thursday.
   The investigation was concluded last April with the report
completed in September, agency officials said.
   Three of the school districts - Pittsburgh, Richmond, Va., and
Charleston, W.Va. - had not tested for lead at the time of the
survey.
   The other 10 school districts were Philadelphia and Chester in
Pennsylvania; Baltimore and Montgomery County in Maryland;
Huntington and Jackson in West Virginia; Alexandria, Caroline
County and Fairfax County in Virginia and Washington D.C.
   ``Many schools were either not testing their water or, if they
were testing, may have been testing improperly,'' said the report.
   The EPA considers lead concentrations above 20 parts per billion
to be hazardous to school children. The report said that the agency
believes every year more than 250,000 children are exposed to lead
level in drinking water that are high enough to impair their
intellectual and physical development.
   There are about 44 million youngsters in the nation's schools,
33.6 million in kindergarten and the elementary grades.
   Nationwide, only Minnesota requires local school officials and
day care centers to test their drinking water for lead, the
auditors said. Other states only recommend such tests.
   Congress passed a law in 1988 that requires EPA to issue testing
guidelines and provide help to schools for the tests.
   The report blamed both the EPA and states for lack of vigor.
   While there are an estimated 600 different models of water
coolers that have lead components and, therefore, pose a health
hazard, the EPA so far has identified only 33 such models in
guidelines to school districts. A number of the schools surveyed
had limited their test programs to only coolers singled out by the
EPA, the auditors said.
   The EPA auditors found that coolers on the EPA warning list were
found to be operating in seven of the 10 school districts where
testing had been done. Four of the districts had coolers that were
not on the EPA list, but were providing contaminated water. Six of
the school districts had drinking water contaminated because of
lead in fountains and plumbing.
   ``At one school, 15 coolers were tested and all 15 exceeded 20
parts per billion,'' said the report. Drinking water was found in
five of the school districts that had lead levels in excess of 100
ppb, or five times the levels considered safe for children.
   They did not identify the schools.
   The report attributed many of the shortcomings to school
officials not having the money to conduct tests. It noted that
while the 1988 Lead Contamination Control Act authorized $30
million a year to help schools test, none of that money so far has
been appropriated by Congress.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Thursday:
   President Bush: Let me just make a brief statement and then I'll
be glad to respond to questions.
   I want to begin today by simply restating for the American
people some of the key points about our efforts to turn back
aggression in the Persian Gulf.
   I believe that it is essential that the American people fully
understand the objectives of the United States and the United
Nations, as well as the magnitude of the outrage perpetrated by the
government of Iraq.
   The United States and the rest of the world are united in the
condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. We have no quarrel with
the Iraqi people. Our problem is with Iraqi's dictator Saddam
Hussein.
   I want a peaceful resolution to this crisis. We're giving the
United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq time to work. But let me
be very clear, there will be no compromise on the stated objectives
of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
   Iraq's brutality against innocent civilians will not be
permitted to stand, and Saddam Hussein's violations of
international law will not stand; his aggression against Kuwait
will not stand.
   And now I'd be glad to take questions. I think, Tom, you have
the first one.
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, - (inaudible) - say that your comments in
recent days have been aimed at least in part in preparing the
American people for the possibility of war. Is that true? (And do
you think the American people are ready, that they have no problems
with it?)

   Here are excerpts from Sir Geoffrey Howe's letter

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Letter from Howe:
   It gives me all the more sadness .... to acknowledge the growing
difference which has emerged between us on the increasingly
important issue of Britain's role in Europe.
   As much as you, I have wanted to make the most of Britain's
influence in the world, to deploy Britain's sovereignty to the best
advantage of our people. Ever since our original application to
join the European Community in 1962, that has clearly involved
Britain's firm, practical commitment to the historic process of
closer European partnership ...
   My vision of Europe has always been practical and hard-headed. I
am not a Euro-idealist or federalist. My concern is less with grand
schemes than with immediate realities, as they affect our
well-being and prospects as a nation. Like you, I have fought too
many European battles in a minority of one, to harbor any illusions
on that score.
   Our conduct of policy on the crucial monetary issue in Europe -
first on ERM (the Exchange Rate Mechanism) and now on EMU (European
Monetary Union) - has given me increasing grounds for concern ...
   We mst be at the center of the European partnership, playing
the sort of leading and constructive role which commands respect.
We need to be able to persuade friends as well as challenge
opponents, and to win arguments before positions become entrenched
...
   I am deeply anxious that the mood you have struck - most notably
in Rome last weekend and in the House of Commons this Tuesday -
will make it more difficult for Britain to hold and retain a
position of influence in this vital debate.
   Of course, there are still huge questions to be considered and
resolved in this discussion. None of us wants the imposition of a
single currency, but more than one form of EMU (European Monetary
Union) is possible.
   The important thing is not to rule in or out any one particular
solution absolutely. We should be in the business, not of isolating
ourselves unduly, but of offering positive alternatives that can
enable us to be seriously engaged.
   Cabinet government is all about trying to persuade one another
from within. So too, within the unique partnership of nations that
is making the European Community. Plain speaking certainly - but
matched always by mutual respect and restraint in pursuit of a
common cause.
   The need to find and maintain common ground on the European
issue within our own party will be crucial to our electoral success
and the future of the nation. In all honesty I now find myself
unable to share your view of the right approach to this question.
On that basis, I do not believe that I can any longer serve with
honor as a member of your government ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Letter from Mrs. Thatcher:
   ... Your letter refers to differences between us on Europe. I do
not believe these are nearly as great as you suggest. We are at one
in wishing to preserve the fundamental sovereignty of Parliament.
We want Britain to play a leading part in Europe and to be part of
the further political, economic and monetary development of the
European Community.
   As I made clear in my statement to the House, our aim is to find
solutions which will enable the Community to go forward as twelve.
I believe the party is united behind these aims and demonstrated
that very clearly in the House on Tuesday: we have always been the
party of Europe, and will continue to be so.

<TEXT>
   Final polls on California's costly
seesaw battle for governor reported conflicting results Thursday.
   Republican Pete Wilson was leading Democrat Dianne Feinstein in
one statewide survey and was running neck-and-neck with her in two
others.
   To date, both candiates have spent a total of about $40 million
on their campaigns since last year. Final spending is expected to
approach $50 million.
   The Los Angeles Times' poll, a survey of 1,993 voters over four
days ending Tuesday, showed Wilson with 43 percent and Feinstein
with 42 percent, and a statistical margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
   Pollster Mervin Field reported Wilson with 47 percent and
Feinstein at 39 percent, with 1,248 voters surveyed over five days
ending Tuesday. Field said his margin of error was 2.9 points.
   Field's California Poll showed Wilson had increased his lead by
3 points over an earlier October survey. In the Times poll,
however, Wilson had declined 2 points. The earlier polls were 47-42
for Wilson in Field's poll and 45-42 for Wilson in the Times poll.
   A third survey by Southern California pollster Steve Teichner
reports Wilson with 37 percent to Feinstein's 36 percent, compared
with 37-30 for Wilson in mid-October. One thousand registered
voters were polled. The margin of error was 3.2 points.

   Some Jewish leaders said President Bush
overstated the case when he suggested Thursday that Saddam Hussein
had surpassed Adolf Hitler in at least one form of brutality. One
called it ``an unfortunate exaggeration,'' another ``a slip of the
tongue.''
   But several said Saddam-Hitler comparisons were apt to a certain
extent, and one said he thought the president was just using an
understandable figure of speech.
   Bush, speaking at a Republican rally in Mashpee, Mass., said the
Iraqi leader's forces ``have committed outrageous acts of
barbarism.''
   And he said American hostages were being ``held in direct
contravention of international law. Many of them reportedly staked
out as human shields near possible military targets, brutality that
I don't believe Adolf Hitler ever participated in.''
   Later, at a news conference in Orlando, Fla., Bush said, ``I
don't think I am overstating it. I know I am not overstating the
feelings I have about it.''
   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate director of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, said, ``Saddam Hussein has a list of crimes
that I don't think has to be compared with anybody in order for the
people of America to understand how serious a threat he
represents.''
   Cooper said he believed there were comparisons that could be
made between the Iraqi president and the World War II German
dictator whose regime resulted in the extermination of about 6
million Jews.
   ``But let's also keep this thing in some sort of perspective,''
he said. ``And to say that he outstrips Adolf Hitler, I just think
it's either a slip of the tongue or a speech writer got carried
away. No one yet, and I hope no one ever will, match up to the
systematized brutalities and racist policies that Adolf Hitler
committed.''
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, called Bush's remark ``an unfortunate exaggeration
that could hurt the president's credibility at a time when it is
very important that he remain credible.''
   ``Saddam Hussein is writing his own chapter of barbarism,''
Foxman said. ``It's the Saddam Hussein chapter and one need not
compare or exaggerate.''
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
asked about the president's remark, said, ``I think he is being
figurative in using Hitler as the supreme standard or measure of
brutality. In a figurative sense, we understand why he is making
the comparison to Hitler. I don't think even President Bush means
to make the literal comparison as to who is more evil.''

<HEAD>Elections Officials Give Opposition Group Victory in Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition group Round Table-Free Georgia
nearly swept parliamentary elections in the southern Soviet
republic last week to win most of the seats in the new legislature,
official results showed.
   The official Central Election Commission said Thursday that the
non-Communist group, led by popular Georgian independence activist
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, won slightly more than 54 percent of the
popular vote in the final tally from Sunday's voting, the official
news agency Tass reported.
   The Georgian Communist Party, which had embraced many of the
radical positions of the nationalists, won 29.4 percent, likely
making it the second most powerful bloc in the new parliament but
dashing predictions of a close race.
   Both groo lead the multi-ethnic Caucasus
republic to independence from the Soviet Union.
   Half the members of the 2ups have vowed t50-seat legislature were chosen
from
the lists of individual candidates to represent various districts.
The rest were chosen at large, in proportion to the number of votes
cast for each party or bloc throughout Georgia.
   The results gave Gamsakhurdia's group 114 seats and the

<HEAD>Joseph Papp Turns Down More NEA Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer Joseph Papp turned down $323,000 in
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts on Thursday, the
second time this year he has refused money from the federal
government.
   In a letter to NEA chairman John Frohnmayer, Papp, who heads the
New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, said the festival
found ``the new legislation for the continuance of the National
Endowment for the Arts punitive and an infringement on the civil
rights of artists and arts institutions.''
   The money would have been used for the festival's theater and
music-theater programs.
   Papp's action came despite the NEA's decision last month to drop
its policy of requiring grant recipients to sign a pledge saying
they would not violate restrictions imposed by Congress on
obscenity.
   ``What this means financially is a substantial increase in our
problems as an institution to raise additional funds,'' Papp told
reporters. The Public has a yearly budget of some $14 million and
has been able to raise about $12 million each year to cover costs.
That still leaves a deficit of about $2 million that must be erased
each year, he said.
   In April, Papp rejected a $50,000 grant from the endownment to
help underwrite the Festival Latino, a month-long program of Latin
American theater, music and films at the Public Theater.

<TEXT>
   A: Tom, I want to have a peaceful resolution to this question.
And our dealing through the United Nations and working with them
for common objectives I think is evidence of that.
   I've indicated we're prepared to give sanctions time to work,
and I'll repeat that here again today. But I am not ruling out
further options, and I'm not trying to prepare our country for war.
   We have a little bit of a hiatus, because of the attention on
the budget and other matters, from keeping in focus our objectives
in Iraq. There's been a little less attention to it in some
quarters, and I want to - in a sense, Tom, it's a little bit
awkward because here we are just a few days before an election, and
I want to continue to work for Republican candidates, but I must
continue to keep our objectives regarding Iraq in focus. And so
what I try to do is separate out the foreign affairs, the Iraq
question, from domestic politics.
   But it is essential that I do the latter, but it is not - in
doing that, I am not trying to sound the tocsin of war, but I am
trying to point out the concerns that I feel, for example, on the
hostage question. And I'll continue to do that.
   Q: Do you think the American people though, sir, are ready for
war?
   A: Well, I don't - I think the American people feel as I do,
that they'd much prefer to have a peaceful resolution of this
question, but who can tell what would happen in a situation of this
nature. There's a lot of unforeseen things that can take place, and
I think I would have to go to the American people with my
recommendations, if it regarded the safety or defense of our key
interests. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President - Mr. President, you said today -
   A: Sorry.
   Q: I know you said that Saddam Hussein was even more brutal than
Adolf Hitler, talking about starving out the Americans in the
embassy in Kuwait City. Is there a chance that you might be
exaggerating a bit for effect? And coming just one week before the
election - I know you said that you keep these separate - but
you're making these statements on the bandstand with your political
party behind you. If you really want to keep these separate, why
don't you just address the nation in some other forum?
   A: Well, I'm addressing it in another forum now, and this is in
a nationally covered press conference, I'm sure. I don't, I don't
think I'm overstating it. I know I'm not overstating the feelings I
have about it.
   The reports coming out of Iraq just today cause even further
concern, these reports of the way our innocent civilians are being
treated. I think the American people are as outraged as I am about
the treatment of the people in our embassy for example, and I think
it's important that they know my concerns on this subject.
   So, I don't, I don't the last question that you raise does
concern me some, but it is very important that I keep pointing out
the objectives and where I think Iraq stands.
   All the people we're addressing are extraordinarily interested
in that, and I go to great ends to make sure that I give proper
credit to the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress, make clear
that this is not a partisan effort that we're involved in here. I
have been very gratified for the enormous support from both houses
of Congress and from the American people.
   But I, as we continue to move forces and as we see the various
events taking place over there, I think it is important that the
President continue to spell out for the American people not only
our objectives, but telling them how I feel about the various
events.
   Q: Mr. President, are you - one follow-up - are you considering
now a reprovisioning mission of some sort?
   A: Well, I am hopeful still that the United Nations resolutions
that call for reprovisioning will be followed, and I'd rather leave
it there. But I am very concerned about the people in that embassy.
   It's cut off from food. They have enough right now, but the
whole - whole ploy by Saddam Hussein is to starve them out. And I
think that is unconscionable, and I think the world needs to know
how strongly those of us in the United States responsible for this
policy feel about it.
   Q: Mr. President, apart from the distraction that may have been
caused by the budget battle, what other factors have caused you to
approach this task of readdressing this issue with such urgency?

<HEAD>Popular Front Leader Calls for U.N. Troops to Intercede</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moldavian nationalist leaders on Thursday blasted
the Kremlin's deployment of security forces in the embattled
republic and demanded U.N. peacekeeping troops replace the Soviet
soldiers, news reports said.
   The Moldavian Popular Front asked the republic to ``declare
immediate and unconditional secession from the U.S.S.R. and press
for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from the territory of the
republic and suspension of the activity of KGB bodies,'' according
to a statement reported by the official news agency Tass.
   The statement said the legislature also must ``ask the United
Nations to introduce its troops into Moldavia for a period
determined by the republic leadership,'' Tass reported.
   The front, a leading nationalist group, has been caught in the
middle of a secessionist battle between the Gagauz minority and the
government of Moldavia, a republic of 4.3 million bordering
Romania.
   The Gagauz minority, a Christian people numbering about 150,000
and living mostly in the southern corner of the republic, declared
sovereignty last week and began holding elections for its own
government. They claim Moldavia has been discriminating against
minorities in the republic during its own drive for independence.
   Bands of Moldavian nationalists rushed to the area to oppose the
Gagauz, triggering the deployment of two Interior Ministry
regiments last weekend.
   The first violence came Wednesday when Moldavians attacked the
frontier with Romania, threatening to kill guards and their
families unless Soviet forces withdraw, Tass reported.
   The militants gave up. No casualties were reported.
   Similar separatists movements have sprouted nationwide, and are
hampering Gorbachev's efforts to negotiate a union treaty that
would solidify ties among divergent peoples and regions.
   Gagauz representatives have been negotiating with a joint
Moldavian-Soviet committee trying to resolve the standoff in the
Gagauz districts. Both sides agreed to pull back their defenders,
mostly youths armed reportedly with sticks and metal rods, and
allow the security forces to establish a buffer.
   The Gagauz also have postponed their elections for an
independent government during the negotiations.
   The Popular Front's statement also urged the parliament in
neighboring Romania, whose people share a common language and
culture with Moldavians, to ``immediately consider giving
assistance to Romanians who are discriminated against by the
U.S.S.R,'' the independent Postfactum news agency reported.
   Romanian President Ion Iliescu said in an interview on Austrian
television Wednesday that Romania would not seek to alter its
border with Moldavia, Tass reported.

<HEAD>Contribution Limits Dumped; Ruling Affects New Initiatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court discarded a
ban Thursday on legislative fund raising in non-election years and
raised the stakes for competing ballot measures in next week's
election.
   The court said that when two rival measures are on the same
ballot and get majority votes, the one with more votes takes effect
and the other cannot be enforced.
   The 5-2 ruling voided what remained of Proposition 68, a
campaign finance initiative for legislative candidates that was
approved in 1988 by 53 percent of the voters. Proposition 73, a
milder campaign finance measure on the same ballot, got 58 percent.
   The court rejected arguments by Common Cause and other groups
backing Proposition 68. They maintained parts of the measure that
did not expressly conflict with Proposition 73 could be salvaged -
an overall limit on contributions to legislative candidates and a
ban on fund raising during non-election years.
   Contribution limits in Proposition 73 were ruled
unconstitutional by a federal judge but were allowed to remain in
effect for legislative races until appeals were resolved.
   Thursday's ruling could affect several sets of competing
initiatives on Tuesday's ballot, wiping out all provisions of a
measure that passed by a majority but got fewer votes than a
conflicting measure.
   For example, Propositions 131 and 140 contain rival sets of term
limits for officeholders, but each also contains other provisions:
voluntary spending limits and partial public financing of campaigns
in Proposition 131, and a cut in the Legislature's budget in
Proposition 140.
   Propositions 130 and 138, regulating logging, and Propositions
128 and 135, affecting pesticides, also could be affected.
   When a second measure is ``directed to the same subject and
offered as a competing regulatory scheme ... only the provisions of
the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote are operative,''
Justice David Eagleson wrote.
   Lower courts had interpreted state law to require comparison of
each provision of rival initiatives to decide whether parts of a
measure receiving fewer votes could be enforced separately.
   Eagleson rejected that approach as ``judicial legislation.''
   Justice Stanley Mosk, in a separate opinion, said patching
together parts of two competing initiatives could create ``a
Frankenstein's monster whose existence the voters never
contemplated.''
   But dissenting Justice Joyce Kennard, joined by Justice Allen
Broussard, said the approach the court rejected was required by
state law.
   The ruling does not become final for at least 30 days. It would
not appear to affect fund-raising for legislative candidates in
next week's election, currently governed by Proposition 73.

<TEXT>
   A: Well, we're getting, you know - the sand is running through
the glass. And we've got these economic sanctions in play and I
think there's an urgency on the part of people to understand -
desire on their part rather - to understand whether the sanctions
are working. We continue to move force, and I think it's important
that the American people know why I'm continuing to do this.
   And so, I think it's just rather that there was a period where I
didn't do as much of it. But now I'm going to keep on - now and on
past the election as well.
   Q: Mr. President, I know you say that you're not trying to
prepare the American people for war, but could not your message of
today and this week be summed up as that you are seeking a peaceful
resolution if possible, but a military one if not?
   A: Well, I think that I've made those statements before. I think
I've been rather consistent in pointing out that I would not rule
anything out. If you go back and look at the things I've said, I
believe I've been on the record before with that kind of comment,
Brit.
   Q: Mr. President, Saddam Hussein today invited American families
to come visit the hostages over the next holiday. The two-part
question, sir, is would you welcome such visits by Americans? And
what do you make of that kind of offer to them?
   A: I think it's a well, let me start. I think that those people
should come home to visit with their families. I think they should
be released from captivity.
   This canard of calling people that are held hostage - calling
them ``guests'' when they're hostages is turning off the whole
world.
   And further, the reports that are coming out from some of these
French hostages coming home of their understanding of the way the
Americans are being treated is just terrible. And the whole concept
of staking out people for - next to what might become military
targets is also unconscionable. So I see it as a ploy, but I don't
think he'll win the ``humanitarian of the year'' award for that. I
think that people see it as a rather brutal toying with the
emotions of families, frankly. Charlie?
   Q: (Inaudible.)
   A: I would - we have a notice out that we are discouraging
Americans from going there. And that would hold.
   Q: Mr. President, you said on one occasion that your patience is
running out, that you've had it. You're telling us on this occasion
you're willing to wait and see if the sanctions work.
   We've see your senior staff out today - (inaudible) -
consistency, but yet there seems to be a variance there. Are you
having trouble getting your message across?
   A: No, and I don't think there's any inconsistency. And if you'd
like - I don't want to take up your time, but, thinking I might get
a question of this nature, I wrote down the various things that
I've said on this subject for some time, and they are quite
consistent.
   One time you might have a little more emphasis on one point,
like yesterday on the outrage I feel about the hostages; at another
you might have a little more emphasis on having the sanctions work.
But I think we have been extraordinarily consistent. And I think
our - I think the key point on this regarding substance is that our
allies understand this. They know exactly where the United States
stands in terms of our determination to see the United Nations
sanctions fulfilled. So I'm not worried about it.
   There was one story today that was, you know, just clearly wrong
in that regard. But I think we've had a rather consistent approach
to this, very consistent, and so I don't worry about that. And I -
the key point would be if our allies thought that, and they don't,
or Saddam Hussein thought that - and he doesn't. He can't.
   Q: I'd like to just follow up. Before you were concerned about
an erosion within your alliance - (inaudible) - Saddam Hussein may
be successful in trying to keep apart - (inaudible.)
   A: I know he's going to continue to try to do that, Charles.
He's doing it every way he can. He did it first - an interesting
point. He contacted, his people contacted a parliamentarian in
Canada, roughly the same day they contacted the Foreign Minister of
Germany, roughly the time they contacted a member of parliament in
the United Kingdom. And the whole concept was, ``You come; we'll
parcel out some hostages.'' Trying to divide and show a
humanitarian side of some sort.
   He continues to - through the Primakov visit, I think his
concept there was to try to find some division, and I don't think
that division exists. But it does concern me that he not be
successful.
   And that's why I think it is important that the United States
continue to reiterate our conviction on seeing that there can be no
compromise with this aggression and that these United Nations
resolutions must be fulfilled in their entirety. Yeah?

   Thousands of U.S. Marines aboard several
amphibious assault vessels on Thursday simulated a landing on the
beaches of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   It was the second such major exercise for the U.S. Navy and
Marine Corps deployed to the region as part of the mass land, air
and sea buildup following Iraq's invasion three months ago.
   The first, in which the amphibious warship USS Iwo Jima took
part, had been ``successfully accomplished,'' said Lt. Kevin
Wensing, a spokesman for Command Naval Forces, Central Command.
   Elsewhere Thursday, colleagues stopped to mourn 10 of the
crewmen of the Iwo Jima killed in a boiler-room accident off
Bahrain.
   The Iwo Jima accident occurred Tuesday as the warship ended a
rest and recreation spell at Bahrain's Mina Sulman port and was
heading out to participate in the assault exercises starting that
same day.
   Wensing said elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade,
and Amphibious Task Group 2, were conducting the amphibious
training exercise in the north Arabian Sea from Oct. 30 to Nov. 8.
   The exercise, he said, involved ``surface and heliborne
operations on a remote beachhead'' in which 20 fixed-wing aircraft
and 75 helicopters were being employed.
   ``The purpose is to continue Navy and Marine Corps training in
amphibious landing skills and to familiarize these forces with the
desert environment,'' he said.
   Exact location was not given for security reasons, he said. But
it is known the first exercise took place somewhere off Oman.
   Wensing, noting there were 18-20 amphibious assault ships in the
region, declined further detail on the marine exercise but stressed
the accident was not in any way affecting the Amphibious Task
Force.
   The Iwo Jima is one of Amphibious Task Force ships assigned to
assist Operation Desert Shield, preparing to storm Kuwait from sea
if the military option is decided to try to end Saddam Hussein's
occupation.
   There are 46,000 Marine Corps personnel deployed in the task
force, with 11,000 aboard the ships and the rest in Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>Huge Advantage For Incumbents In Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional incumbents had a huge 20-to-1
money advantage over their challengers heading into the final push
of this year's election campaign, the Federal Election Commission
said Thursday.
   Incumbents in House and Senate races had a combined $120 million
in cash on hand, compared to just $6 million for the challengers,
according to federal election disclosure forms for the period
ending Oct. 17.
   Overall, $303 million had been spent on the congressional
elections through that date, 2 percent less than in the comparable
period two years ago and just slightly more than in 1986.
   The FEC data included all candidates, even those without
competitive elections.
   An analysis of the data on Senate races by Common Cause showed
that the the 27 Senate incumbents who have major-party challengers
had a combined $23.9 million in the bank. The challengers had $3.5
million.
   Those incumbents raked in more money in part because of a 4-to-1
edge in donations from political action committees, and they have
outspent the challengers through Oct. 17 by $99.7 million to $34
million.
   Not surprisingly, only a handful of the 32 incumbents who sought
re-election this year are at risk of losing their seats.
   ``The election process will not be competitive as long as the
huge financial gap continues between incumbents and challengers,''
said Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer. Common Cause supports
public financing of elections.
   The fattest Senate campaign chest as of Oct. 17 was that of Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with $5.26 million. Next was Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., with $2.35 million. Neither was considered in
political trouble.
   The most expensive Senate contest is in North Carolina, where
incumbent Republican Jesse Helms spent $10.8 million through Oct.
17 defending his seat from Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt.
Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte, spent $4.6 million.
   Overall, $134 million has been spent on this year's Senate
races. Through Oct. 17, all candidates had raised $151 million,
compared with $157 million in the similar period for the 1988
elections.
   In the House, $206 million has been raised this time, compared
to $202 million two years ago. $169 million of that has been spent
this year, compared to $165 million in the same period in the 1988
elections.
   Several House incumbents had more than $1 million in reserve,
even though they had no serious opposition.

   The spectre of Philly-phobia is haunting
Democratic legislative candidates as Republicans scare taxpayers by
telling them a vote against the GOP is a vote for a bailout of the
state's largest city.
   Electing Democrats will mean dumping millions of state dollars
into Philadelphia's supposed fiscal black hole, Republicans across
Pennsylvania contend.
   As far away as Erie, in the state's northwest, Republican Harry
Bowser, who was bounced from his House seat two years ago by
Democrat Thomas Scrimenti, is mounting a campaign of revenge. He
says Scrimenti is a lackey of the Philadelphia House leadership.
   House Speaker Robert O'Donnell, a Democrat, is from
Philadelphia.
   Earlier this week, House Minority Whip Samuel Hayes said a
Democratic candidate in Lancaster would be ``like an orange, ready
to be squeezed'' by Philadelphia lawmakers seeking money for their
beleaguered city.
   In Crawford County, incumbent Rep. Connie Maine's opponent,
Republican Teresa Brown, is saying Maine has voted for Philadelphia
politicians and that when it comes time for a bailout she'll do it
again.
   Pennsylvania politicians have long practiced Philly bashing as
an easy way to lay blame for problems and threaten voters that
``this could happen here.'' They complain that the state's biggest
city gets it all, while the little guy goes without.
   But this year with increasing regularity, the question of
whether a lawmaker voted in favor of legislation to benefit
Philadelphia, supported Philadelphia lawmakers, or was backed by
Philadelphia lawmakers is turning into a major election issue.
   Philadelphia faces a $206 million deficit in the fiscal year
that ends next June 30. Mayor W. Wilson Goode has frozen hiring and
delayed pension fund payments and tax refunds, but the city expects
to go broke by Dec. 1.
   Few taxes can be raised or added without state approval and its
wage tax already is among the nation's highest. Standard &amp; Poors'
has lowered the city's bond rating to CCC.
   Officials from both sides of the legislative aisle say
Philly-phobia is a good way to win votes. Especially when
candidates try to link their opponents with Philadelphia's
financial problems and charge they'll send taxpayers' money to help
rescue the city.
   Jack Stollsteimer, aide to O'Donnell, said the ``divide and
conquer'' strategy usually means the candidate doesn't have much
else to attack.
   ``It's on a much larger scale than it's ever been done in the
past. It's much more orchestrated,'' Stollsteimer said.
   Republicans use the tactic to scare voters into thinking that
supporting Democrats will mean a spread of Philadelphia's liberal,
Democratic thinking, he said.
   ``Both sides are trying to win the middle class and the
Republicans always try to say that the Democrats represent `them' -
the lower class, poor people, black people - not `us,' the middle
class voters,'' Stollsteimer said. ``With the city's financial
trouble, they think they have an issue that plays to people's worse
fears.''

   Amnesty International announced Thursday it is
asking Saudi King Fahd to investigate allegations that his security
forces have tortured and otherwise mistreated hundreds of Yemenis.
   The Yemenis are being forced out of Saudi Arabia in retaliation
for Yemen's position on the Persian Gulf crisis. Yemen is widely
seen as a tacit supporter of Iraq, which it has been reluctant to
condemn for the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   In its statement in London, the international human rights group
said the Yemeni victims ``were among the thousands of Yemeni
nationals who were rounded up in the space of a month.''
   The group said the roundup, expulsions and ill treatment were
``for no apparent reason other than their nationality or their
suspected opposition to the Saudi Arabian government's position in
the gulf crisis.''
   At least 400,000 Yemenis left Saudi Arabia between late
September and late October.
   ``More than half the Yemeni population in Saudi Arabia already
has left the country. We don't want those still in the country to
suffer the same abuses,'' Amnesty said.
   Yemen's foreign minister, Abd al-Karim al-Iryani, said in an
interview last month that the expulsions were intended to cripple
his nation's fledgling government. He said the Saudis hope the
deluge of refugees will overwhelm Yemen.
   The Yemenis in Saudi Arabia send remittances home. Those funds
constitute about one-third of the gross national product of Yemen.
   The country, which is at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is
one of the poorest in the Arab world. It was created in May by the
unification of pro-Western North Yemen with Soviet-allied South
Yemen.
   On Sept. 18, Saudi authorities withdrew special status for the
1-2 million Yemenis in the kingdom, including many who lived there
more than 30 years. They were given about two months to find a
Saudi sponsor or go home.
   The Saudis have invited U.S. and other national forces onto
their soil to counter Iraq's army, which is just across the Kuwaiti
border.
   In addition to appealing to King Fahd, a representative of
Amnesty International raised the group's concerns about torture,
detention and arrests last week with the Saudi Arabian ambassador
in Washington, D.C., the statement said.
   ``We want the government to ensure that the investigation is
carried out,'' Amnesty said. It said the inquiry should be public.
   In the group's release, the Saudi government was quoted as
saying it did not believe there had been any ``widespread
violation'' of its policy of treating Yemenis with ``affection and
dignity.'' Saudi authorities said they would look at the
information submitted by Amnesty, the statement said.
   However, there was no public comment from the Saudis.
   An Amnesty research team in Yemen spent several days
interviewing people crossing from Saudi Arabia and collected
information on 800 people arrested and detained, including many who
had been tortured or mistreated, the statement said.
   The team saw some people with torture marks, the statement said.
The group interviewed a man who had been beaten so badly he had to
be hospitalized. The researchers said Yemenis reported beatings on
the feet, near suffocation and sleep deprivation, according to the
statement.
   Most of those interviewed said that after they were arrested,
Saudi officials asked them if they supported Yemen's position in
the gulf crisis.

   Q: Mr. President, in the beginning of this crisis you held out
little hope for a diplomatic solution. Today -
   A: Did you say ``a little hope'' or ``little hope''?
   Q: Little hope for a diplomatic solution. Today you talk about
hoping that there's a peaceful resolution. I'm just wondering, are
we any closer to possibly having a diplomatic solution?
   A: I don't see that. I don't see that we are.
   I've said from the very beginning I hoped that the sanctions
would have an effect that would cause him to comply with the
resolutions.
   I think they're having an effect. But our problem is, and the
problem of our allies around the world is we can't certify for the
world how disastrous or strong an effect these sanctions are
having.
   But from the very beginning I've been saying I would hope that
the sanctions would be effective. And we'll give them time. Again,
my problem is, and the problem with those with whom I consult very
closely, is we can't say how much is enough in terms of the
sanctions or how much time it would take.
   Q: Well, sir, if you do not expect a diplomatic solution, but
you're hoping for a peaceful resolution, does that mean you expect
Saddam will just give up?
   A: That's what I would like to see, yeah. That's what the United
Nations calls for - calls for him to withdraw; calls for the
restoration of the rulers. And so that's exactly what he ought to
do.
   And I think if we hold firm - and we are holding firm in this
coalition with some 25 countries in the Gulf or on the sea there,
plus the solidarity that the United Nations has demonstrated - I
think he'll eventually - you know, the hope is eventually he might
do that. But we can't guarantee to the American people how long
will it take. Yeah?
   Q: Sir, your wife was campaigning in Omaha today, and I don't
know if you've seen reports about that. She was asked if you would
consider meeting face to face with Saddam Hussein, and replied,
quote, ``I think he would consider anything to get the Kuwaitis
back in their own country and get'' - (inaudible).
   That is being interpreted that you would consider a one-on-one
meeting with Saddam. Would you?
   A: I would consider it without - if there was an agreement that
he would totally withdraw and comply fully, with no conditions, to
the United Nations sanctions.
   I mean, I think anybody would do that. But that would mean that
he has to do exactly what I've been saying here, with no condition,
no negotiation - just leave. But I don't at that juncture that it
would be much of a pleasant meeting.
   But I never - that's something that I guess Barbara was asked on
her own. I've not discussed it with her or anybody else. But that's
the only way that it would be productive for me to have a meeting,
it seems to me, because there is no flexibility on our position.
There is no compromise, there is no conditionality. My position,
and I think it strongly represents the coalition partners'
position, is he must comply. And so I don't think a meeting short
of just acceptance of those terms would be in the national interest
or in the interest of the coalition. Yeah?
   Q: I have a question -
   A: Yes, sir, John, and -
   Q: - about the self-serving skepticism - (inaudible) - speaking
out on Iraq. It's not just because of the elections - (inaudible).
It's also because of the signals we've been getting about the
embassy in Kuwait had plenty of food and water for the time being.
The ambassador - the Dutch ambassador's wife said Tuesday morning
on one of these morning television programs that they were planting
vegetables there, that they have a well there, all seems to be
going well. All of a sudden, the next day, we're - (inaudible).
What caused this change?
   A: I don't think it is a change. I've been increasingly
concerned about it. I'm delighted to know about the vegetables.
That's the first time I've heard of that. And I've known that
they've had enough tuna fish for some time.
   There was earlier estimates that the embassy would have to be
closed before now, and they've stretched the time frame there.
   But it's that plus the reports coming out of Iraq that make me
feel I must keep this in focus for the American people. They must
know how strongly I feel about an American embassy, the American
flag flying, and these people inside being cut off, and I would say
brutalized by that behavior; and secondly, how strongly I feel
about the Americans that are held hostage in Iraq itself.
   And it is essential that we not lose track of that - of those
key points. These people are not guests. They are hostages. And I
think there hasn't been - I think you're on to something, because I
don't think there has been that much discussion lately of these
things that really concern me, John. These matters concern me
deeply. Yeah?

   Q: Mr. President, a political question. If you're - (inaudible)
- for Clayton Williams. (Inaudible). Is there any - (inaudible)
that at this stage of the game due to the fact that - (inaudible).
   A: Well, I'm not familiar with the details of that. I am
strongly in favor of Clayton Williams over his opponent, not just
for personal reasons, either. And don't ask me for a review of the
ballot items yet. I will be voting down there Tuesday and take a
look at them. And don't ask the people of California, where they
don't have one, but they have I don't know how many on there of
these referendum items on the ballots.
   So I'm not troubled by that, because what I see in Clayton
William (sic) is a person that will be a very good, strong governor
for the state. And I am enthusiastically for him, and I'm not even
familiar with the details of the amendment - you know, the ballot
item you're talking about.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, - (inaudible) - Mr. Quayle said yesterday that
the United States must - (inaudible) - Iraq's chemical,
psychological, and nuclear - (inaudible).
   A: Well, I think from the very beginning an objective - we
spelled out some objective, but one that I think has been clearly
spelled out has been ensuring the security and the stability of the
Gulf. And that obviously is affected by the possession of these
chemical and biological weapons and things of that nature. So I
don't think that the goalposts are being moved.
   I think it's just simply a statement of reality. .
   If you're going to have a stable and you're going to have a
secure Gulf after Kuwait is freed and the Iraqis have withdrawn
their invasion, you're going to have to have some arrangements, I'm
sure - I think others would agree with this around the world - that
guarantee the peace there.
   And I would hope that, as I've said early, I want all United
Nations - United States forces out of there as soon as possible,
every single soldier. And it's important I keep repeating that,
because there's this - the allegations by some over in that part of
the world that we want to keep forces there. That's not what we
want to do. We want to come out. But there has got to be some
security arrangements worked out, absolutely.
   Q: Mr. President, just to make sure I understand what you're
saying, the United States and this international force we have
cannot successfully leave, first of all, until we have secured in
some manner the - (off mike).
   A: Oh, no, I wouldn't say that, but there have to be some
security arrangements that guarantee against a future aggression of
this nature. Yeah, Maureen?
   Q: Mr. President, you said today that Saddam Hussein had
committed atrocities that were reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. Could
you tell us what Hussein has done that compares with the holocaust?
   A: Worse than what - compares with what Hitler has done?
   Q: With the holocaust.
   A: Yeah. Go back and - well, I didn't say the holocaust.
   Q: Well, you said -
   A: I mean, that is outrageous, but I think brutalizing young
kids in a square in Kuwait is outrageous, too.
   And I think if you go back and look at what happened when the
Death's Head Regiments went into Poland, you'll find an awful
similarity.
   I was told, and we've got to check this carefully, that Hitler
did not stake people out against potential military targets and
that he did indeed respect - not much else - but he did indeed
respect the legitimacy of the embassies. So we've got some
differences here, but I'm talking - when I'm talking about - there
- I see many similarities, incidentally.
   I see many similarities by the way the Iraqi forces behaved in
Kuwait and the Death's Head Regiments behaved in Poland. Go back
and take a look at your history and you'll see why I'm as concerned
as I am. Yeah.
   Q: Mr. President, you've spoken out about the brutality against
the so-called - the hostages in Iraq. However, there's a report
today by Amnesty International that there has been some of our own
allies - the Saudi Arabians have been guilty of committing some
kind of atrocities, at least torturing some citizens of Yemen who
are in their country. What do you say to that and will you put any
pressure on them to change their ways?

<TEXT>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes. I think I did - I have not seen that. And I
don't think that - I think that violations of individuals' rights
or torture should not take place. And I'll be glad to represent
that.
   Q: How do you feel, though, about the United States helping
someone who's doing the same sort of things as you're criticizing
the Iraqis for?
   A: I feel that I'm delighted that we are there with the Saudi
Arabians to stand up against this kind of aggression -
international aggression in violation of international law. And
that is the question and that's where I'm going to keep my focus.
   Because it is very important, one, that Saudi Arabia be
defended.
   And I think - now I think that we can certify that Iraq does not
have the capacity to invade Saudi Arabia. And secondly, we are
united with Saudi Arabia in our determination to overthrow this
aggression. Yeah?
   Q: Secretary Baker is going to meet Shevardnadze in Europe in
the next few days. Is that because you can't stand that the Soviet
Union is drifting in the Gulf strategy? Or is it because of their -
their appeal behind the scenes after Primakov's visit in Baghdad?
Or is it only because you want to push the START treaty?
   A: Well, we've got a broad agenda of items.
   We've got to finish up CFE. We want to move START towards
conclusion. We have these common interests that you're asking about
in the Gulf. And then we have economic problems that we discuss all
the time. So, there'll be a broad agenda in the meetings with
Shevardnadze.
   And I'm sure that one of them will be a discussion of the
Primakov visit to Iraq, and the Primakov visit that preceded that
to Egypt, and the Primakov visit that followed that to Saudi
Arabia.
   So, I'd - but the mission, if I understand the question, is not
simply to focus on this Gulf question. Because we - I am anxious to
get these other matters resolved. The CFE is all but put to bed but
there's a tiny technical matter that's, I think - well, hopefully
it's been resolved by now. But it's a broad agenda.
   Q: So, you're not concerned that the Soviet Union is drifting in
the Gulf strategy? .
   A: No, I don't. And I think one point that we ought to keep
reminding the American people of is that we are very fortunate in
wrestling with this problem of international aggression - that the
Soviet Union and China have been with us, or we've been with them,
however we want to look at it, in the United Nations as we try to
bring international pressure to bear, and have brought it to bear.
Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, in your - (inaudible) - this morning you were
a lot softer on the Democrats than you've been in recent days. Now,
why the change of heart?
   A: It's not a change of heart, it's a question of - I think I've
made my point. But I'll have a shot at them here as we get into the
- depending how warmed up I get today, campaigning enthusiastically
for Governor Martinez. And I'd like to finish on a positive note
for - in these campaigns, but I think it's a little early to say
that there will be no more flamboyant rhetoric about the Democrats,
because I'm absolutely convinced if we had more Republicans things
would be a lot better. Yeah, Michelle. And then Ann.
   Q: Mr. President, early in the course of this - the Persian Gulf
crisis you said that you would not allow hostage-taking to dictate
your policy. You said that would endanger every American because
every American would then be subject to being held hostage.
   Your comments today seem to change that. It seems to highlight
their situation. Have you changed your mind about the importance of
highlighting hostages - the hostages in this crisis?
   A: I know - I don't - I want to be sure I understand your
question. I'm not sure I understand it on ``highlighting''
hostages. What I think I said before was hostage-taking punishes
the innocent and separates families, back in September, it is
barbaric, it will not work - Sept. 16th - and it will not affect my
ability to make tough decisions.
   Now there are other quotes here, but - so I want to be sure I
understand, you see, because what I think some are picking up is
there's a different emphasis. But I think - is that one in accord
with what you're asking about?

   A man claiming to be a Kuwaiti
resistance member who survived three weeks in an Iraqi prison said
Thursday that prisoners are being tortured and killed to break
their opposition to Saddam Hussein.
   He told a news conference organized by Kuwait's
government-in-exile he escaped and spent three days hiding in
Kuwait before making his way across the desert and across the
border to Saudi Arabia. He said would not describe his method of
escape, in order to protect those who helped him.
   The young man, who spoke on the basis of anonymity, said he was
arrested Sept. 20 and held 23 days. He said he was raped by Iraqi
soldiers and hanged upside down for hours from a ceiling fan while
his interrogators demanded, ``Do you belong to the resistance? Are
you loyal to (Kuwaiti leader) Sheikh Jaber? Do you oppose Saddam?''
   His claims could not be independently verified.
   He said he was held in the basement of a house in the Iraqi port
of Basra with more than 80 others. He said they were permitted
little or nothing for clothing, were awakened each morning at 5,
when they were hosed down with water, and had only bread and water
to eat and drink.
   He said other methods of torture in the prison included pulling
out the fingernails of prisoners, chopping off pieces of their
fingers and hands, yanking out the hairs of their mustaches and
beards with pliers, and burning them with hot irons.
   The man said his captors promised him the ``best'' life if he
would join Saddam's Baath party.

   And I don't know how long, as I've tried to be very frank with
you all. I don't know how long is long enough. But I've just got to
keep putting the focus there and keeping everybody on notice that
we are going to be successful. But it's, you know - I'd leave it
right there. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, sir, my question goes back to the issue of
whether to keep the embassy open. Sir, you do seem to have changed
your position. In August in Kennebunkport you ordered the State
Department and the administration to order all non-essential
personnel home; the Marine Guards were ordered home. There are very
few people there today. Why is it so important to keep the embassy
open? And if an - it sounds as if perhaps an armed conflict might
be triggered ... whether the Embassy gets a resupply of food.
   A: I believe that the Embassy should remain open because I don't
believe a dictator should violate international law by starving out
or isolating another person's embassy. I think there's a
fundamental principle involved in that. And I view the embassy as
entitled to certain international respect and international
protection. And so I just want to be sure everybody knows that I
feel this way. What was the second part?
   Q: Do you ... triggering an armed conflict - whether or not -
whether the Embassy gets a resupply of food?
   A: Well, I don't - I'm not going to - it's too hypothetical. I
mean, you're assuming that it would trigger an armed conflict. And
I'm not going to discuss what will or won't trigger an armed
conflict. But let me simply repeat: this one is one that I believe
is of enormous concern to our allies and to the American people.
And I can certainly recertify, as I did yesterday, that it is of
that kind of concern to me.
   But I don't want to go into what incident, what provocation
would stimulate military action. But I'm very concerned about this.
The last one, he said. Tom, you had your hand up.
   Q: Mr. President, some of your closest friends, some senior
members of your government, and even a lot of Republican members of
Congress who support you are telling us that your White House staff
is simply not strong enough, not heavy enough, to serve you well;
and that further, that's one of the reasons why you've taken
political heat lately. Are any of these people telling you that?
And if they are -
   A: No.
   Q: - how do you react to that?
   A: No, they're not telling me that, because they know that I
have full confidence in my White House staff and full confidence in
my cabinet, and I have been blessed with good advice, some of which
I take and maybe more of which I should have taken in one thing or
another. But I have not - nobody has come and presented that to me
at all.
   I've read meaningless speculation about that in certain
periodicals, but I'm inclined to discount it, because I know what I
feel about my top staff and I know whether they have - whether they
have my confidence or not - and they do.
   Do you have a followup to that one? (Laughter.)
   Q: Over the next couple of months, do you envision any shakeup
at all in the White House staff, either in terms of personnel or in
terms of the structure of the operation?
   A: There may be some. I think we'll have an announcement very
soon on one of our top people - none that has been - not one that's
been speculated about, incidentally. But there could be. It'll be
two years into an administration, and I think if you look back at
history, why, there's been very, very little turnover, so there
could be one or two.
   But it won't be because of the kind of dissatisfaction with
somebody's performance at all, and it damned sure won't be related
to any standing in the polls or anything as - am I ever glad that I
told you all - (laughing) -- and I would like to remind you of it -
months ago, Sept. 3 - (laughter) - no, but seriously, I think it's
fair to point out. I told you, when things were soaring like
eagles, ``Don't believe the polls.''
   And I think now I'm entitled to say ``Hey, they're going to come
on back; don't worry about them. They'll be all right.''
   Thank you ever so much. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

<HEAD>Quizzed On Texas Ballot Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't ask President Bush, who votes in
Texas, his position on that pesky ballot proposal in Texas that
tripped up GOP gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams earlier
this week.
   Bush, during a campaign trail news conference Thursday, was
asked about the proposed constitutional amendment and acknowledged
he was ``not familiar with the details of that.''
   ``I am strongly in favor of Clayton Williams,'' Bush said,
hastening to add: ``And don't ask me for a review of the ballot
items yet. I will be voting down there Tuesday and take a look at
them.''
   Williams earlier this week stumbled when reporters asked his
position on the proposed amendment, which deals with appointments
by the state's chief executive.
   Williams said he was unfamiliar with the amendment, the only one
on the ballot, and was unclear how he had voted on it when he cast
his absentee ballot.
   ``I'm not troubled by that,'' Bush said, ``because what I see in
Clayton Williams is a person that will be a very good, strong
governor for the state. And I am enthusiastically for him, and I'm
not even familiar with the details of the amendment.''
   Polls show the race between Williams and Democrat Ann Richards
is too close to call.

<TEXT>
   Iraq said four American hostages it
described as elderly and sick would soon be freed. It said the move
was in response to a plea from a private group.
   Information Minister Latif Jassim, at a Baghdad news conference,
did not say exactly when the four would be released, but said it
would be soon.
   He did not disclose the names of those to be freed, but later,
the official Iraqi News Agency identified them as Randall Trinah,
Dr. Abdul Kanji, Raymond Galles and Michael Barnes.
   The report did not give their ages or hometowns.
   It said they were being released in response to a petition from
a group called the Arab-American Reconciliation Society, and that a
delegation from the group would accompany them back to the United
States.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman welcomed the news, and said it was
seeking details from Iraq's foreign ministry.
   ``It is good news, our top priority is to get Americans out,''
said an embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Other Americans have been released in groups at the intervention
of another Arab-American group. The Rev. Jesse Jackson brought out
another group.
   The Iraqi official accused President Bush of using the hostage
issue as a pretext for a military strike, which he said could come
any time.
   Jassim added that reporters will be allowed to go to strategic
installations to visit hostages who are being held as human shields
against attack.
   ``All the Americans at sites have complete freedom. They can
watch TV, read books and read newspapers,'' the Iraqi official
said. ``They also enjoy the friendship of Iraqi forces.''
   Two smuggled letters from captive Americans made very different
claims about life in Iraqi captivity. One said he had lost 35
pounds, and that he had received no mail or messages in two months
of captivity.
   The other described the toll of isolation as captivity stretched
on.
   ``You can survive. But individually interned, (one) must be
psychologically capable of living alone within himself,'' he wrote,
adding a plea: ``Do not forget the guest hostages.''
   The letter-writers were not identified, and the official
releasing the letters demanded anonymity. He said non-American
foreigners being freed had carried the handwritten letters
addressed to the embassy.
   Iraq refers to the estimated 600 foreigners interned at
strategic military and industrial sites in Iraq and occupied Kuwait
as guests.
   The complaints coincided with a report that the Iraqi Foreign
Ministry has instructed missions abroad to issue visas for
foreigners wishing to spend the Christmas and New Year holidays
with their relatives.
   The British Foreign Office dismissed the offer as ``a cynical
propaganda move on the part of the Iraqis'' and advised the
relatives not to go.
   Several relatives told the British Broadcasting Corp. television
that they intended to go.
   And the Iraqi News Agency said former Prime Minister Edward
Heath, who had helped secure the release of more than 50 Britons in
October, called on the families of ``British guests'' in Iraq to
accept the offer. INA said its correspondent in London reported 10
wives would do so.
   Saddam banned foreigners from leaving the country and interned
some of them after the U.S.-led multinational military buildup
began in the Persian Gulf. The deployment was triggered by Saddam's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Since then, some groups of foreigners have been allowed to
leave. More than 250 French nationals were released this week after
Iraq decided France was making a good-faith effort to resolve the
crisis.
   On Thursday, the official Iraqi News Agency said the National
Assembly would begin deliberations this weekend on whether to allow
an estimated 690 Bulgarians in Iraq and Kuwait to leave.
   Saddam asked lawmakers to consider freeing the Bulgarians after
a visit to Baghdad by a Bulgarian delegation headed by Vice
President Atanas Semerdzhiev.

<HEAD>International Ownership Should Be Welcomed, Neuharth Said</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should give up its barriers
to foreign ownership of broadcast outlets and European governments
should give up their broadcast monopolies, the founder of USA Today
said Thursday.
   ``We should be less afraid of being fleeced by foreign investors
and more receptive to being fed by them'' said Allen H. Neuharth,
chairman of the Gannett Foundation, in a speech at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
   Cross-border ownership will bring ``better information products
to readers and viewers'' just as the expansion of major U.S.
newspaper companies to ownership of publications far from their
home markets has improved newspapers in this country, said
Neuharth.
   ``I am delighted at the foresight of Robert Maxwell, Rupert
Murdoch and others in making media investments in Eastern Europe as
soon as the walls came tumbling down,'' he told an audience of news
executives.
   Maxwell is a British publisher; Murdoch is an Australian by
birth with worldwide media interests who became an American citizen
to satisfy the ownership rules for television stations.
   Neuharth urged the newly free journalists of Eastern Europe not
to yield to the temptations of ``journalistic arrogance'' but to
``search for the truth, with fair and balanced reporting.''
   When he was chairman and chief executive of Gannett Corp.,
publisher of daily newspapers in several cities, Neuharth oversaw
the development of USA Today, the national daily newspaper
published in Arlington, Va. near Washington.

<HEAD>Mulroney Announces Creation of Forum on Canada's Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Thursday that
Canada risks splitting along French-English and regional lines, and
he announced creation of a 12-member forum to seek a consensus on
the country's future.
   The announcement, made in a speech to the House of Commons, came
four months after the failure of the Meech Lake accord, which was
aimed at winning the signature of French-speaking Quebec on the
1982 constitution.
   Mulroney also spoke five days before a Quebec commission is to
begin its own work reconsidering the ties that bind Quebec to
Canada.
   ``The situation is urgent ... the problem is serious,'' Mulroney
said.
   He said the new federal forum is made up of Canadians from all
walks of life, though none is a politician. Its mandate will be to
seek consensus on what people want from Canada and what they want
Canada to be.
   ``The idea is to have people who are not `tainted' by
partisanship,'' said Harvie Andre, House leader of the governing
Conservatives.
   The new forum is to report back to the government by July 1,
Canada's national holiday.
   The Meech Lake accord failed in June, when the legislatures of
Manitoba and Newfoundland decided against ratifying it.
   Their refusal to sign angered many of the 6.7 million Quebecers
and touched off huge protests across Quebec. Some demonstrators
demanded that Quebec separate from Canada.
   Recent polls show that 60 percent of Quebecers favor a new
status for Quebec, with options ranging from greater autonomy to
full independence.
   French-speaking Quebecers, known as Quebecois, are a minority
among Canada's 26 million people. They have long felt treated as
second-class citizens by English-speaking Canada. The French fear
that without special measures and privileges, their culture will be
overwhelmed by English Canada.
   The Meech Lake agreement would have designated Quebec as a
``distinct society'' and given it and the other provinces more
power in such areas as Supreme Court appointments and Senate
reform. The ``distinct society'' clause did little more than
acknowledge the obvious, but it was of tremendous symbolic
importance to the French speakers.
   ``It's time we all did some soul searching,'' Mulroney said,
acknowledging that finding a consensus will not be easy.
   In a country where all citizens are legally equal, how can the
special needs of the French-speaking minority as well as natives
and residents of the poor Atlantic provinces be accmmodated, the
prime minister asked.
   It seems clear there will be some change in the relationship
between Quebec and the rest of Canada after the failure of Meech
Lake. The only question seems to be how far down the road to
sovereignty the Quebecois want to go.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa clearly does not want separation.
   Justice Minister Gil Remillard said recently that both the
status quo and total independence are out of the question.
   In any case, it's unlikely that most Quebecois will be too
excited about Mulroney's commission.
   ``They are not hanging on the results of this exercise,'' said
Richard French, a former Quebec minister. ``They are hanging on the
(findings of the Quebec) commission,'' he said.
   That 36-member group, known as the Commission on the Political
and Constitutional Future of Quebec, is to issue its report in
March.
   Richard Spicer, the former head of the Canadian Radio,
Television and Telecommunications Commission, is heading the
government forum.
   ``The assignment is awesome,'' he said. ``The procedures are
ill-defined and completely untested. The outcome is entirely
dubious, and there is a very high potential for fiasco.''
   But he added, ``We all think that Canada deserves another
chance.''
   ``We are cordially inviting the politicians to keep their noses
out of this; they are not welcome,'' he said.

   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar was
sentenced to six months in prison Thursday for leaking a wiretap to
a former mobster and lying to the FBI.
   Aguilar was convicted of the two felonies in August. He plans to
appeal the convictions but faces likely impeachment by Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle of Philadephia, assigned to
the case by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, said Aguilar's crimes
would normally warrant a sentence of 21 to 27 months in prison,
including time added for ``abuse of trust.''
   Bechtle said he imposed a shorter sentence than called for in
federal guidelines because of the ordeal Aguilar will experience in
impeachment and disbarment proceedings.
   ``These proceedings will be long and humiliating and
embarrassing and burdensome, a major and substantial punishment,''
Bechtle said.
   He also said the jury's verdict of obstruction of justice ``by a
judge no less is a chilling message indeed.''
   The maximum possible sentence was 10 years in prison and
$500,000 in fines.
   Aguilar's sentence includes fines and assessments of $2,100, and
1,000 hours of community service during two years of supervised
release after imprisonment.

   Aguilar, 59, of San Jose was the third federal judge convicted
of a felony in the last decade. He was appointed by President
Carter in 1980.
   In 1984, U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was
convicted of tax evasion. In 1986, U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon
of Mississippi was convicted of perjury. Both were impeached and
removed by Congress, the only way a federal judge can be forced out
under the Constitution.
   U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida was acquitted in
1983 of conspiracy to solicit a bribe, but he removed from office
based on a congressional finding of perjury.
   In two trials, Aguilar was acquitted of approaching two fellow
judges to seek favorable treatment for former Teamsters leader Rudy
Tham, who was trying have his embezzlement conviction overturned,
and businessman Ronald Cloud, then facing trial for bank fraud.
   Aguilar said he made only innocuous inquiries in each case.
   He was convicted during his second trial of two coverup charges:
disclosing a wiretap in February 1988 to Abe Chapman, an elderly
ex-mobster who was Tham's go-between, and lying in April 1988 to
FBI agents who questioned him about the wiretap and his involvement
in Tham's case.
   Prosecutors sought a three-year sentence for Aguilar, citing the
seriousness of any crimes by a federal judge and saying Aguilar
repeatedly lied as a witness in his own defense.
   Aguilar's lawyer, Paul Meltzer, sought probation and community
service, saying he had an ``exemplary record,'' had been
``destroyed'' by the case and faced possible danger in prison.
   Aguilar did not make a statement during the one-hour sentencing
hearing. Afterward, he approached Meltzer in the hallway with a big
smile and thanked him. Jess Aguilar, one of the judge's brothers,
said it was ``a lighter sentence than we anticipated.''

   At least 21,744 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel
in October, setting a record in the current Soviet immigration
wave, officials reported Thursday.
   According to the Absorption Ministry, 134,000 immigrants have
arrived so far in 1990, among them 122,000 from the Soviet Union.
The rest were from Argentina, Europe and North America, ministry
spokeswoman Ida Ben-Shitrit said.
   She said 20,000 Jews came from the Soviet Union in October. Gad
Ben-Ari, spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency that
helps handle immigration, said 21,744 came.
   Israeli officials expect 200,000 Soviet Jews to arrive by the
end of the year and say more than 1 million Soviets might come
before 1993.
   October's was the highest monthly immigration figure since the
massive influx of 1948-51, the nation's first years of statehood.
The previous recent high was in September when 19,500, nearly all
of them Soviets, arrived.
   The immigration is aggravating unemployment, housing problems
and straining the government's budget. A family of three receives
about $9,000 in government subsidies during its first year in the
country, the daily Jerusalem Post said.
   Israel has budgeted $2.3 billion over the next three years for
immigrant absorption and is seeking financial aid from outside
sources.
   The Jewish Agency has gotten $740 million in help from abroad,
and its Board of Governors appealed to world Jewish groups
Thursday, asking them to mobilize $1.3 billion in addition to the
$600 million they have pledged to gather by the end of 1991.
   The numbers coming in are causing a strain. On Thursday, the
Jewish Agency decided to limit to one ton - as opposed to the
previous two tons - the luggage that an average Soviet family of
three is allowed to bring to Israel. Transfer of the luggage
belonging to Soviet immigrants cost the organization $8 million in
September.
   The Agency also decided to limit to 10 months the period during
which the immigrants are allowed to keep their belongings at state
warehouses in Israel, Ben-Ari said.
   A family of four that agrees to leave its belongings in the
Soviet Union will get $1,000, he said.

   Federal safety officials on Thursday blamed
the United Airlines inspection system for failing to detect a
flawed engine part that caused an crash in Iowa last year that
killed 112 people.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, issuing its opinion
without dissent, said at a hearing that a yearlong investigation
had concluded that United did not properly consider human
limitations in its quality control procedures.
   The board said that as a result, inspectors missed a fatigue
crack in a critical area of a titanium fan disk in the tail engine
of the DC-10 aircraft.
   The plane, United Flight 232 en route from Denver to Chicago,
crashed when trying to make an emergency landing in Sioux City,
Iowa, killing 112 of 296 aboard.
   The safety board said the disk, made by General Electric
Aircraft Engines disintegrated with force so great that the
protective housing of the aircraft's hydraulic system used to
control its flight was shredded.
   United officials, who attended the daylong hearing, rejected the
board's conclusion, saying there is no evidence a half-inch crack
in the bore area of the fan disk could have been detected when the
part was last inspected in April 1988.
   Bob Doll, United's vice president for engineering and quality
assurance, put the airline's position more succinctly.
   ``GE gave us a bum part,'' he said.
   He said United had fully cooperated with the safety board's
inspection and said the board's staff did not understand the zeal
with which the airline's inspectors look for defects.
   The flight was en route to Chicago when pieces of metal from the
fan disk pierced the tail section of the aircraft, leading to a
series of events in which all three hydraulic systems aboard were
disabled.
   The three-man flight crew, joined by another United pilot who
was a passenger on the flight, flew the aircraft to the airport at
Sioux City, Iowa, using the thrust of the remaining two engines to
partially control the aircraft.
   But the plane crashed on touchdown.
   During the hearing, safety board staff members testified that in
repeated simulations of the situation faced by Flight 232's pilots,
the conclusion was reached that the plane could not have been
landed safely.
   John K. Lauber, a safety board member, hailed the pilots,
saying, ``the team performance was in fact exquisite in this case
and in fact resulted in the saving of lives.''
   The titanium alloy fan disk in the tail engine of the United
plane was manufactured by General Electric in 1971. It weighed 370
pounds and was about 32 inches in diameter.
   The safety board concluded that a flaw in the disk, which later
resulted in a half-inch long crack in a vital area of the engine
part, was formed during manufacture of the titanium ingot from
which the disk was forged.
   It said that crack could have been detected in the disk's most
recent inspection by United.
   James Wildey, a metallurgist who assisted in the investigation,
called the flaw ``a buried defect'' and added: ``That defect has
been in there since day one.''
   ``There is no way to introduce this kind of defect through
operations or anything else,'' he said.
   Merritt Birky, a chemical research investigator for the board,
said that using normal inspection procedures there was no reason
why United shouldn't have found the crack.
   He noted that chemicals used to detect flaws in airlines
inspections of engine parts were found on the failed disk and said
they should have warned of a defect.
   The chemicals are expected to penetrate any cracks on the
surface. The surface is wiped clean, then a blotter-like substance
applied that should draw the chemical back out of the crack. The
blotter will fluoresce under ultra-violet light if any of the
chemical has been absorbed from the interior of the metal.
   The disk in question had been inspected six times, the last time
17 months before the crash, without any flaws being found.
   The board concluded that hundreds of inspections of such disks
over the course of 17 years without ever discovering a flaw led to
laxity on the part of the airline's engine inspectors.
   The board said that available inspection methods at the time of
the manufacture of the disk by GE did not detect the existence of
the defect.
   But it did not otherwise blame GE, other than to complain that
GE production records relevant to the failed disk were incomplete
and did not insure adequate traceability of the engine's component
parts.
   The safety investigators performed exhaustive tests on the
failed disk after its two broken parts were found in corn fields
some 80 miles from sioux City.
   In other conclusions, the safety board said that the emergency
response at the Sioux City airport was ``initially effective.''
   But it said the presence of a corn field near the crash site and
the failure of a water supply truck ``adversely affected fire
fighting operations.''
   Noting that a number of small children were killed or injured in
the crash, the board also said that the Federal Aviation
Administration has not adequately addressed the issue of infant
protection on passenger aircraft, including the possibility of
requiring child safety seats. The FAA is considering such a
requirement.
   The board also issued a series of recommendations, including
these to:
   -Identify emerging technologies that can simplify or automate
the inspection process with the aim of developing a ``second set of
eyes'' to intensify inspection of critical engine rotating
components.
   -Encourage research and development of backup flight control
systems for new wide-body aircraft using an alternative source of
power for control systems.
   -Conduct safety reviews of currently operating aircraft to give
all possible consideration to developing alternative power sources
for flight and engine controls and to protect them from unforeseen
accidents.

   The Environmental Protection Agency gave
clearance Thursday for the limited disposal of radioactive wastes
from nuclear weapons plants at an Energy Department site in New
Mexico.
   The EPA action clears the way for the Energy Department to begin
a critical five-year test at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near
Carlsbad, N.M. The plant eventually is hoped to be the nation's
first permanent repository for low and medium-level atomic wastes.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins has said he planned to begin
shipping drums of radioactive wastes from government weapons plants
to the New Mexico plant next January.
   The wastes in question are not only radioactive but are also
chemically hazardous.
   The EPA, which must approve the disposal of hazardous wastes,
whether radioactive or not, said the permit for the test program
was being given under the conditions that the waste be limited to
8,500 drums and that they be retrievable.
   Once the test is concluded, the Energy Department will have to
obtain new approval from the EPA to store wastes at the $700
million underground depot.
   The EPA said it considers the New Mexico site, a mined salt bed
2,150 feet underground that will be sealed will cement and
compacted salt, to be geologically stable and impermeable. The
agency said it is confident that planned handling procedures will
prevent migration of wastes from the site.
   Some concern had been raised earlier this year that a
combination of gases could be formed that might cause an explosion.
Although the EPA said such an accumulation of gases is unlikely,
the agency has required close monitoring of potential gas buildup
during the test period.
   The Energy Department has been under considerable pressure to
proceed with the development of the repository because officials in
several western states have balked at temporarily storing any more
radioactive wastes from the weapons plants.
   The wastes destined for the New Mexico site include a variety of
materials left over from the production of atomic weapons including
radioactive sludge as well as contaminated tools, equipment and
clothing.

<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials decided Thursday
to stave off a shutdown of the savings and loan bailout by taking
advantage of a drafting error in last year's law.
   The mistake will allow the Resolution Trust Corp. to borrow up
to $18.8 billion more than Congress apparently intended.
   The short-term borrowing, to be repaid through the sale of
loans, real estate and other assets once owned by failed S&amp;Ls,
frees the agency to continue some cleanup activities into early
next year.
   The agency can now pay acquirers to take over 18 large insolvent
thrifts whose rescue had been indefinitely postponed.
   David C. Cooke, executive director of the agency, complained in
a memo that congressional inaction still would cause a two-month
delay of those 18 deals, originally scheduled for completion before
Dec. 31.
   Also, the agency will have to postpone the rescues it had
plannedfor the January-March period until the following quarter,
he said.
   The delays in shutting down money-losing thrifts will cost
taxpayers $250 million to $300 million, he said. If the
administration had decided against taking advantage of the error in
last year's law, further delays would have cost taxpayers an
additional $350 million to $400 million, Cooke said.
   The trust corporation's oversight board, which is chaired by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, reached its decision in a
private telephone conference call after the House early Sunday
morning refused to grant the administration's request for more
money.
   Brady had said the trust corporation needed $40 billion more to
cover S&amp;L losses, on top of the $50 billion authorized by last
year's law. It also needed additional authority to borrow
short-term until S&amp;L assets are sold, he said.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, told Brady in a letter Wednesday that he did not believe
Congress, which is adjourned until January, would object if the
administration used the drafting error to temporarily borrow $18.8
billion.
   However, the congressional inaction on Brady's request for $40
billion more to cover thrift losses has still left the
administration facing a complete halt in the bailout early next
year.

<TEXT>
   Soviet newspapers are becoming more competitive
and enterprising, two journalists from the country told American
colleagues Thursday.
   ``It's very exciting to be a journalist in these times,'' Oleg
Shibko, a Moscow-based editor for the Novosti Press Agency, said at
the Associated Press Managing Editors convention.
   Shibko and Vitaly Gan, Washington correspondent for the
Communist daily Pravda, described a new law that gives Soviet
journalists more freedom. ``With this new law, we are in the same
position as the Western media are today,'' Shibko said.
   The law grants freedom of the press, but prohibits publication
of state secrets, pornography or material with a tone of racial or
ethnic superiority.
   The new freedom has given rise to several new dailies that have
eroded the circulation of the Soviet Union's older, giant
newspapers.
   Pravda's circulation, for instance, has fallen from 11 million
to 7 million, Gan said. He predicted circulation would fall another
2 million or 3 million next year and needs a ``radical facelift.''
   ``Pravda is still on the conservative side,'' Gan said. ``It
still lacks flexibility.''
   Shibko said Soviet newspapers eventually will face the same
market pressures faced in the United States. ``I'm sure only those
that meet the demands of the reader will prosper,'' Shibko said.
   Both journalists predicted the Soviet press eventually will
accept Western-style advertising and create op-ed pages reflecting
a greater diversity of views.
   The Communist party's long use of the press for propaganda has
weakened Soviet journalists' credibility, Gan said.
   Gan said a story he wrote about Washington's homeless was
greeted with disbelief. ``Our readers don't believe,'' he said.
``People say, `We're sick and tired of hearing your lousy
propaganda.'''
   Pressed for an analysis of the Soviet economy and politics, the
journalists predicted some of the 15 republics would leave the
union in th next few years.
   President Mikhail Gorbachev's international popularity will not
help him at home, Gan said. Soviets were unimpressed that Gorbachev
won the Nobel Peace Prize, he said.
   ``If you have to stand in line to get cigarettes, do you care if
your leader gets a Nobel?'' Gan said. ``If you have to stand in
line for bread or meat, do you care?''

accused Jesse Helms, his Republican opponent for the U.S. Senate,
of trying to scare voters. About 100 miles away, Helms was on the
stump claiming Gantt was ``no good.''
   ``Sen. Helms has decided that the best way ... is to insult your
intelligence, to scare you, to be divisive, to drive wedges between
people,'' Gantt told a rally of about 600 people in this port city.
   Helms told supporters in Graham, a small industrial town half
way across the state, that Gantt was trying to divert voters'
attention.
   ``Mr. Gantt says what we're saying is divisive,'' Helms told
about 200 people. ``That's right. It's dividing him from any
reasonable standings in the polls.''
   Gantt referred to an advertisement that began airing Wednesday.
It showed the hands of a white man holding, then crumpling a job
rejection letter.
   ``You needed that job,'' the announcer says. ``And you were the
best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a
racial quota. Is that really fair? Gantt supports Ted Kennedy's
racial quota law that makes the color of your skin more important
than your qualifications.''
   Helms has also run a radio ad accusing Gantt of running a secret
campaign aimed at black voters by running ads on stations with
largely black audiences. Another Helsm ad says Gantt used his
minority status to get a television station license, which he and
his partners later sold.
   Campaigning in Greensboro, Helms was asked if his comments and
ads would insult black voters. By way of a reply, Helms said his
Senate office has assisted more than 700,000 people and about 40
percent of them were black.
   Helms also mentioned Gantt's past involvement in the television
station.
   ``The (FCC) application says the reason they wanted this TV
station is so it could serve the minority interests in the
Charlotte area,'' Helms said. ``It made him a millionaire, but he
doesn't want to admit that. This guy can't tell the truth about
anything.''
   Gantt said Helms was bashing a legitimate business deal and
denied it made him a millionaire.
   Opinion surveys published Thursday showed how close the results
might be Tuesday.
   Helms was ahead by about 4 percentage points in one poll and
Gantt was ahead by the roughly the same in the other.
   A poll conducted jointly for WRAL-TV and The News and Observer,
both in Raleigh, found 44.1 percent of 812 registered voters said
they would vote for Helms. Gantt was preferred by 40.1 percent of
respondents.
   Fewer than 11 percent said they were undecided in the survey
conducted Sunday and Monday. The margin of error was 3.5 percentage
points.
   In the other poll, Gantt held a 4 percentage point lead. The
survey was broadcast by WTVD-TV of Durham and included 839 likely
voters. It was conducted Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Gantt was
the favorite of 48 percent of the people polled. Helms was the pick
of 44 percent.
   Eight percent said they were undecided in the survey, which had
a margin of error of 3.5 percent.

   Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe resigned
from the government Thursday following a rift with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher over Britain's commitment to Europe.
   His resignation came five days after Howe suggested in a
television interview that Mrs. Thatcher would eventually drop her
adamant opposition to a single European currency.
   In his letter of resignation, Howe said, ``I am deeply anxious
that the mood you have struck - in Rome last weekend and in the
House of Commons this Tuesday - will make it more difficult for
Britain to hold and retain a position of influence in this vital
debate.''
   ``... I do not believe that I can any longer serve with honor as
a member of your government.''
   At the European Community summit last weekend, Mrs. Thatcher
found herself alone against 11 other leaders who set a timetable
for currency union. Then in a rowdy House session, Mrs. Thatcher
shouted her attitude toward a single currency and closer political
ties within Europe: ``No! No! No!''
   ``Cabinet government,'' Howe wrote, ``is all about trying to
persuade one another from within. So too, within the unique
partnership of nations that is making the European Community. Plain
speaking certainly - but matched always by mutual respect and
restraint in pursuit of a common cause.''
   Mrs. Thatcher responded that she did not believe their
differences ``are nearly so great as you suggest,'' and said she
was saddened by his departure.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher has been bitten by the man she treated as a
doormat - and she deserves it,'' said Neil Kinnock, leader of the
opposition Labor Party.
   ``This is a mortal blow to Mrs. Thatcher's government,'' said
Paddy Ashdown, leader of the small, pro-European Liberal Democratic
party.
   ``The reason is Europe and the split in the Conservative Party
is now irreconcilable,'' Ashdown said in an interview with Channel
4 television news.
   Howe was the last Cabinet minister to have served continuously
since Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979, but he had appeared to
be out of favor since he was replaced as foreign secretary last
summer.
   The resignation was announced two days after Mrs. Thatcher
sidestepped a challenge from Kinnock to declare her confidence in
Howe. ``The deputy prime minister is too big a man to need a little
man like you to stand up for him,'' Mrs. Thatcher told Kinnock.
   However, she said nothing about Howe's disagreement with her
about European policy, which had long been evident.
   Tall, rotund and soft-spoken, Howe seemed an unlikely
participant in a controversy. Labor Party lawmaker Denis Healey
once remarked that arguing with Howe was ``like being savaged by a
dead sheep.''
   Because of his position on Europe, Howe had been removed as
foreign minister last year and shunted into the newly created post
of deputy prime minister. He also held the titles of lord president
of the council and leader of the House of Commons.
   In a television interview in London, Howe suggested that Mrs.
Thatcher might eventually change her mind.
   ``We've had occasions like this before,'' he said. ``I've
attended a number of summit meetings with the prime minister on
which, at this preliminary stage, we've found ourselves expressing
a sharply different view, or apparently sharply different view.''
   Howe, 63, was first elected to parliament in 1964, was out of
office from 1966 to 1970 and has served continuously since then.
   He was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, the top treasury
official, in Mrs. Thatcher's first cabinet. In 1983 he became
foreign secretary and served until 1989.
   His departure underlined the deep divisions within the
Conservative Party, which trailed Labor by 16 percentage points in
two newspaper polls published last weekend.
   The appearance of disarray has been heightened by a series of
Cabinet shuffles and resignations, beginning with Howe's removal as
foreign secretary in July 1989.
   In October 1989, Nigel Lawson resigned as chancellor of the
Exchequer because of disagreements with Mrs. Thatcher about Europe.
   In January, Employment Secretary Norman Fowler resigned, saying
he wanted to spend more time with his family.
   In July, Nicholas Ridley was forced to resign as trade secretary
after giving an interview in which he characterized moves toward
monetary union as ``a German racket'' intended to dominate Europe.
   Ridley, a fervent believer in Mrs. Thatcher's free-market
ideals, also blasted the French as behaving like ``poodles'' toward
the Germans.

   President Bush sharply attacked Saddam
Hussein from the campaign trail on Thursday, saying that Iraqi
brutalities in the Persian Gulf rivaled those under Adolf Hitler
and pledging anew to ``see his aggression turned back.''
   ``I don't think the status quo can go on forever,'' Bush said.
``I don't know how long is long enough'' to depend on sanctions
alone to force Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Toward the end of a long day of angry rhetoric directed at
Saddam, Bush said, ``I'm not trying to sound the tocsin of war.''
His spokesman said the president was speaking out ``to prepare the
American people for any eventuality.''
   Marlin Fitzwater said, ``If we do have to take dramatic action,
we want them to know why.''
   Bush spent his day campaigning from Massachusetts to Florida to
Ohio for Republican candidates in next week's elections, and
blending his political activity with remarks focused on the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   At his news conference in Orlando, Bush said it was a ``little
bit awkward because we are a few days before an election and I want
to continue to work for Republican candidates.''
   At the same time, he said he wanted to keep the American people
informed about his feelings in the Persian Gulf, where more than
200,000 American forces are deployed.
   But there were signs that some Democrats were beginning to chafe
at Bush's gulf rhetoric in the final days of the mid-term election
campaign.
   ``If the president wants politics to end at the water's edge, he
has an obligation to leave events beyond the water's edge out of
campaign politics,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   ``If the president has important information concerning the
pending crisis in the gulf, he should transmit that information
from the White House, not from the campaign trail,'' Obey said.
   The president told reporters at a late-afternoon news
conference, ``I want to have a peaeful resolution'' to the gulf
crisis. He said: ``I am not ruling out further options, and I am
not trying to prepare our country for war.''
   Bush ordered the military buildup in early August, when Iraq
invaded oil-rich Kuwait. Top American officials have said the
administration is considering adding another 100,000 troops to the
deployment in Saudi Arabia.
   Earlier, in Mashpee, Mass., Bush said Saddam's tactic of using
American civilians as ``human shields'' against attacks on military
targets was ``brutality that I don't believe Adolf Hitler ever
participated in.''
   The remark raised eyebrows and Bush was asked at his Florida
news conference whether his comparison might be overdrawn. ``I
don't think I'm overstating it,'' the president replied.
   Bush was asked about his comparison of Saddam with the man whose
regime killed millions of Jews and other civilians during World War
II, and said there was an ``awful similarity.'' He told reporters
he believed that ``Hitler did not stake people out against military
targets and he did indeed respect the legitimacy of the
embassies.''
   He said there was a valid comparison to be made between the
behavior of Iraqis invading force in Kuwait and the way Nazis
brutalized Poland at the beginning of World War II.
   Bush also was asked about his wife's comments that he would be
willing to meet with Saddam to resolve the crisis. He didn't
exactly embrace the idea, but said his position at any such meeting
would be ``No condition, no negotiation, just leave'' Kuwait.
   ``There is no flexibility on our position. There is no
compromise.''
   Bush scoffed at Saddam's offer to permit families to visit the
hostages during Thanksgiving and Christmas. ``I see it as a ploy,''
said Bush, adding that the hostages should be freed for family
reunions at home.
   ``I don't think he'll win the humanitarian of the year award''
for the offer, Bush said, and he reiterated government advice that
Americans not travel into Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
   Bush's words in Massachusetts were reminiscent of his comments
on Panama before sending troops there last year. He said the United
States has ``no argument with the Iraqi people, none at all. We
bear no hostility to the Iraqi people. .. our problem is with
Saddam Hussein alone.''
   While talking tough at campaign stops in Massachusetts, Bush
also said he still plans to give time for the United
Nations-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq to work.
   ``I want desperately to have a peaceful resolution to this
crisis,'' Bush told a political gathering in Burlington. ``I hope
there will never be a shot fired in anger ... no one wants a
peaceful end to this crisis more than I do, but no one is more
determined to see his aggression turned back than I am and I will
not change on that,'' he said.
   Some of the most combative remarks during the day came from
Fitzwater, who said there would soon be ``a turning point'' in the
status of the diplomats cut off from outside supply at the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait City.
   ``At some point, they've either got to leave or be
re-provisioned,'' he said. He declined to say how many days longer
the group could hold out with their supplies blocked by occupying
Iraqi troops.
   Bush has made no secret of the fact that he would like to see
Saddam out of power, but has not made that a stated objective for
the U.S. military deployed in the gulf.
   However, Vice President Dan Quayle on Wednesday said in an
interview on PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, ``You cannot simply
allow Saddam Hussein to have this military power and have the
technology into the future.''
   ``I believe that the world certainly understands that. A Saddam
Hussein who has ballistic missiles, who has chemical capability,
biological capability, who would like to have the nuclear
capability, cannot continue to have that capability even if he
withdraws from Kuwait,'' Quayle said.
   Deputy National Security Adviser Bob Gates, traveling with Bush
on Thursday, said Quayle's comments did not indicate a shift in
U.S. objectives.
   Bush himself, asked about Quayle's comments, said one U.S.
objective was the ``security and stability of the gulf,'' something
that ``obviously is affected'' by the Iraqi arsenal.
   ``So I don't think that the goalposts are being moved. I think
it's just simply a statement of reality,'' the president said.
   Bush on Thursday spent less time blasting Democrats on budget
and other issues and more talking about the gulf crisis.
   ``I want you to put politics aside,'' he told an audience in
Mashpee.
   Fitzwater said that Bush was urged to continue his attack on
Democrats ``in certain quarters ... but he surveyed the whole
matter and decided this was the best approach.''

<HEAD>Bishops Announce Plan to Revitalize Flagging Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Methodist bishops, facing a
two-decade membership decline, have launched an effort to
revitalize the 9-million-member denomination.
   A pastoral letter, released Wednesday by 100 bishops attending
an international conference, and a supporting document called for
revitalizing United Methodist Church's local congregations.
   The documents did not spell out a plan for shoring up sagging
membership.
   Mainline Protestant groups in general have suffered a loss in
membership over the past 20 years. United Methodist Church
membership has eroded steadily since a peak of 11 million members
in 1965.
   ``The whole document we have prepared has a section in which we
talk about the malaise in the United Methodist Church,'' said
retired Bishop Roy Clark of Memphis, Tenn., executive director of a
bishops committee that prepared the letter and related documents.
   ``It's not a negative judgment against anybody, but means we
need to be awakened to the fact that we need to be more vital
because the culture no longer supports the church as it once did,''
he said.
   ``The obvious decline in membership of many of our congregations
troubles us,'' the supporting document states. It adds that the
decline is partially a reflection of a more secular culture.
   Bishops emphasized that neither the letter nor supporting
documents are meant to be a ``grand master plan'' local
congregations must follow.
   The letter, read by Bishop Leroy Hodapp of Indianapolis,
president of the Council of Bishops, declares:
   ``We, the people of God called United Methodists, have come to a
critical turning point in our history. The world in which our faith
seemed secure is passing away. We must choose to be faithful to
Jesus Christ in our time.
   ``There are many signs within our congregations that we
recognize this new era. The realization is dawning on us that we
must be more intentional about being the church God calls us to
be.''
   About 3,200 clergy and lay persons from around the world were to
take part in the conference, which continues through Sunday.
   The United Methodist Council of Bishops, a major denominational
policymaking body, was to meet Nov. 6-9 in Fort Worth.

   Iraq on Thursday promised to release four more American hostages
soon and insisted it is treating foreign captives well. President
Bush denounced the hostage-holding and unleashed his harshest
rhetoric yet against Saddam Hussein.
   ``They have committed outrageous acts of barbarism,'' Bush said
of Saddam's forces. ``Brutality - I don't believe that Adolf Hitler
ever participated in anything of that nature.''
   ``I don't think the status quo can go on forever,'' Bush said
while campaigning for Republican candidates in Orlando, Fla. But he
added, ``I don't know how long is long enough'' to depend on
U.N.-ordered sanctions alone to force Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   Aboard the USS Iwo Jima, sailors and Marines paid tribute to 10
comrades killed in a boiler-room accident. The deaths Tuesday were
the worst Navy casualties to date in Operation Desert Shield, the
U.S. military deployment launched after Iraq overran Kuwait three
months ago.
   Despite Iraqi assurances about the captives' welfare, letters
smuggled from two American hostages and released by a U.S. official
in Baghdad painted a picture of fear.
   One of the unidentified Americans said he had been moved five
times and was receiving no mail or messages. He said he had lost 35
pounds.
   The other said he considered himself a prisoner in the ``Iraqi
gulag'' and pleaded: ``Please do not forget the guest hostages.''
Iraq calls the detained foreigners guests.
   Bush's comments directed at Iraqi President Saddam reflected an
escalation in rhetoric to match the United States' growing military
might in the Persian Gulf region. The United States has said up to
100,000 troops will be dispatched to join the 220,000-member force
already deployed.
   ``Today I am more determined than ever: this aggression will not
stand,'' the president told an audience earlier Thursday in
Burlington, Mass. ``The brutality against innocent citizens will
not be tolerated and will not stand.''
   Bush's remark comparing Saddam's abuses to Hitler's raised some
eyebrows in the audience. He was asked at his Florida news
conference whether his comparison might be overdrawn. ``I don't
think I'm overstating it,'' he replied.
   Bush said there is an ``awful similarity'' between Saddam and
Hitler, whose regime killed millions of Jews and other civilians
during Wrld War II.
   The president said he believed that ``Hitler did not stake
people out against military targets and he did indeed respect the
legitimacy of the embassies.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was trying
``to prepare the American people for any eventuality'' and added:
``If we do have to take dramatic action, we want them to know
why.''
   Iraq expressed renewed fears that the United States will use
reports of hostage maltreatment as a pretext to launch a military
strike. Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jassim, announcing plans
to free four sick and elderly Americans, denied the captives were
being treated badly. About 1,000 Americans are believed held in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``All the Americans at sites have complete freedom. They can
watch TV, read books and read newspapers,'' he told reporters in
Baghdad. ``They also enjoy the friendship of Iraqi forces.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency identifed the four to be freed as
Randall Trinah, Dr. Abdul Kanji, Raymond Galles and Michael Barnes.
It did not give their ages or hometowns or say when they would be
freed.
   It said the pledge to release them was in response to a petition
from the Arab-American Reconciliation Society, and said a
delegation from the group would accompany them to the United
States.
   Thousands of foreigners were trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the
invasion. Since then, Iraq has selectively freed hundreds of them.
The latest mass release was of hundreds of French nationals this
week.
   Western governments have denounced what they say is Saddam's use
of the hostages to try to split the multinational alliance opposing
him.
   The issue is proving divisive. Britain's Foreign Office on
Thursday criticized Germany over former West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt's plans to visit Baghdad to press for foreign
hostages' freedom.
   Brandt is going as a private citizen, but with the German
government's endorsement.
   Iraq said it would to allow holiday visits by relatives of
hostages, but Bush scoffed at the offer Thursday. ``I see it as a
ploy,'' he said, adding the hostages should be freed for family
reunions.
   ``I don't think he'll win the humanitarian of the year award''
for the offer, Bush said.
   The U.S. reaction coincided with a report that the Iraqi Foreign
Ministry has instructed missions abroad to issue visas for
foreigners wishing to spend the Christmas and New Year holidays
with their relatives.
   The British Foreign Office dismissed the offer as ``a cynical
propaganda move'' and advised the relatives not to go.
   As tensions rose, Bush's wife, Barbara, on a campaign stop in
Omaha, Neb., said the president would do whatever he could to end
the crisis, including meeting with Saddam.
   ``I think he would consider anything to get the Kuwaitis back in
their own country, and to get our men out,'' she said.
   In the memorial ceremony aboard the amphibious assault ship USS
Iwo Jima, more than 1,000 American servicemen stood at attention on
deck, honoring the 10 victims of Tuesday's boiler-room accident.
   Reporters and photographers were not permitted to attend the
memorial service, but the Navy released a videotape of the event.
Servicemen sang the Navy hymn, a 21-gun salute was fired, and
bugles played taps.
   As the Iwo Jima mourned Tuesday's victims, thousands of other
Marines went ahead with exercises in which they simulated a landing
on the beaches of Kuwait.
   Navy officials refused to disclose details about the exercises
but said they were being held off Oman. The Iwo Jima was en route
to the drills when the accident happened, forcing it to turn back
and anchor at Bahrain.
   The Pentagon said Thursday that Iraq has removed about 300
armored vehicles from Kuwait while adding more artillery pieces.
Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said that Defense Department
analysts see little significance in the changes.
   He said the number of Iraqi troops in an around Kuwait was the
same as a month ago - about 430,000.

<HEAD>Health of 500,000 Hurt by Soviet Nuclear Tests, Doctor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500,000 people have suffered
health problems as a result of 40 years of nuclear blasts at the
main Soviet test site in Semipalatinsk, a Soviet doctor was quoted
as saying Thursday.
   The TT national news agency quoted the doctor, Mayra Zhangelova,
as saying one-third of the children born in the area have birth
defects and that various forms of cancer have increased
significantly among the population.
   She said she based her comments on a review of newly
declassified material, the news agency reported.
   The doctor was speaking at an international symposium for
doctors in Lulea, northern Sweden.
   An American expert at the symposium, Anthony Robbins of Boston,
was quoted as saying, ``This appears to be the worst experience
anywhere in the world with nuclear weapons tests.''
   Robbins is a leading member of Doctors Against Nuclear Arms,
which organized the symposium.
   About 300 nuclear devices have been detonated since World War II
in Semipalatinsk in Soviet Kazakhstan, a western Asian republic.
Little has been reported about the health effects on the nearby
population.
   Zhangelova said medical reports had been classified until
earlier this year and that she was preparing a comprehensive study
of the effects, TT said.
   The agency said local resistance to the test program had
intensified this year.
   It said the Soviet military resumed nuclear testing at another
site in the Novaya Zemlya islands in the Barents Sea two weeks ago.
That test prompted widespread protests inside and outside the
Soviet Union.

<HEAD>French Painting Stolen From Gallery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A painting of a Parisian street scene by the
French artist Maurice Utrillo, with a selling price of $320,000,
was snatched this week from a gallery as three people looked on,
authorities said Thursday.
   ``Rue a Montmartre'' was stolen Tuesday from the Soufer Gallery
during business hours, said Gregory Smith, an independent adjuster
who represents the painting's underwriters.
   The theft was ``a snatch and grab'' operation, said Detective
Joseph Keenan. He refused to elaborate.
   Smith said the theft was the work of a professional art thief.
   The gallery owner, an employee and a client were in the small,
one-room gallery when the theft occurred, Smith said.
   ``The item happened to be right next to the door and when the
individual was led into the gallery, he grabbed it and ran, and a
car was moving and he jumped into the car and they sped off,'' he
said.
   After the man was buzzed into the gallery by the employee, he
held the door ajar with his foot, reached over to the painting,
lifted it off the wall and fled with it, he said.
   No weapons were involved, Smith said.
   The painting, signed by the artist and dated 1926, was done in
watercolors on paper, he said. It shows a street in Montmartre, a
district in Paris that is known for its cafes and the artists who
have lived there.
   Keenan said there was a similar ``snatch and grab'' theft of a
$350,000 artwork last week, but he would not provide details or say
whether police believed the two thefts were related.

   Ma Anand Sheela was among seven followers
of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh who conspired to kill U.S.
Attorney Charles Turner, alleged a federal indictment unsealed
Thursday.
   Sheela was personal secretary to the late guru when he ran the
Oregon commune of Rajneeshpuram. She had been imprisoned on
unrelated federal charges until her deportation in 1988 to Germany.
   The plot was disclosed earlier this year and some arrests were
made, but Thurday was the first time Sheela's involvement was
alleged.
   The indictment was issued in May but sealed until the defendants
could be arrested.
   All but Sheela, 41, who is a native of Baroda, India, have been
arrested overseas and are awaiting extradition, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Barry Sheldahl.
   The indictments accuse the defendants of plotting to kill the
guru's physician Swami Devaraj and charges all but Sheela with
illegal interstate transportation of guns.
   The maximum penalty for murder conspiracy is life in prison.
   The other defendants are: Sally Ann Croft, also known as Ma Prem
Savita; Ann Phyllis McCarthy, also known as Ma Yoga Vidya; Susan
Lissanevitch, also known as Ma Anand Su; Catherine Jane Stubbs,
also known as Ma Shanti Bhadra; Carol Matthews, also known as Ma
Prem Samadhi, and Richard Kevin Langford, also known as Swami
Anugiten.
   Croft and Lissanevitch were arrested in England, McCarthy in
South Africa, and the other three in Germany.
   Sheldahl said the alleged plot was an attempt to stop a U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service investigation. That probe
led to Rajneesh's deportation, the arrest of Sheela and other
Rajneeshee leaders and the disbanding of the commune in 1985.
   Rajneesh, who died in India in January, called himself the
``rich man's guru'' and taught meditation as a means to
enlightenment.
   Sheela was deported after serving 29 months in federal prison in
California for her role in various criminal activities, including
attempted murder, arson, and contaminating restaurant salad bars
with salmonella.
   Sheldahl said Sheela is still being sought.
   The Oregonian cited unnamed federal surces as saying she might
be in Switzerland since she married Urs Birnstiel, a Swiss fugitive
from a federal wiretapping charge here.
   The newspaper said Sheela's marriage makes her a Swiss citizen.
If she is in Switzerland, authorities can't extradite her because
the United States and Switzerland have no extradition treaty.
   The indictment said the plotters picked an assassination team
from among themselves and used commune money and a false birth
certificate to buy guns.
   The defendants practiced different ways of killing Turner, and
watched his movements, the indictment said.
   Turner said that before he learned of the plot, he had a sense
of peril.
   ``I had a premonition on June 20, 1985,'' he said. ``I can't say
why. And then later I had another feeling on Aug. 1, 1985.''
   He said the second premonition occurred after he saw a
Rajneeshee pointing a video camera at him while he addressed a
meeting of the Oregon Bar Association.
   No harm ever came to him and the only evasive action he took was
to alter his routes coming home.

<HEAD>Wives of 10 British Hostages Say They Will Fly to Iraq to Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ignoring their government's advice, 10 wives of
British hostages said Thursday they will fly to Iraq to seek their
husbands' freedom. Other relatives welcomed Iraq's offer to let
them visit at Christmas.
   ``We know our husbands are suffering and we just want to go back
and rescue them,'' said Dorothy Goodwin, leader of the group of
wives who said they will go to Baghdad next week.
   ``We are aware of the Foreign Office advice not to make the
trip. But we are not politicians,'' she said.
   The British Foreign Office on Wednesday accused Iraq of
exploitation over its offer announced on Iraqi television that it
would let relatives of British, American and other foreign hostages
held in Iraq and occupied Kuwait visit them this Christmas and New
Year.
   In the same statement Wednesday, the Foreign Office repeated its
advice to Britons not to go to Iraq.
   On Thursday, the Foreign Office called on Germany and Italy to
block a planned visit by former West German chancellor Willy
Brandt, who hopes to secure the release of more hostages.
   It said European leaders agreed at their Rome summit last
weekend not to send representatives to negotiate with Iraq for the
release of hostages.
   ``It follows that a visit by Herr Brandt or any other European
politicians must be discouraged in accordance with the conclusions
of the Rome European council,'' the Foreign Office said.
   ``Britain, which has the greatest number of hostages, was not
consulted about this German-Italian initiative,'' it said.
   Iraq holds about 1,800 Britons there and in Kuwait following
President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of the emirate.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government,
which has sent 9,000 troops to the gulf to assist the international
force facing Iraq, has refused to let the hostage issue weaken its
hostility. She wants Saddam tried as a war criminal.
   The 10 women said they will ignore the Foreign Office advice and
use the visas given them by the Iraqi Embassy in London.
   `I am petrified of going back,'' said Mrs. Goodwin, 55, of
Amersham in southern England, who was allowed to return home
recently but had to leave her husband Peter, 58, behind. He worked
as a captain with Kuwait Airlines.
   She said the Iraqi Embassy told the women that traveling in a
large group could boost their chances of meeting Saddam.
   The British Foreign Office on Wednesday dismissed Iraq's offer
to allow visits by relatives to the hostages at the holidays as
cynical. But some relatives said Thursday they will go.
   ``If my son is still in Iraq at Christmas, I shall take every
opportunity of going to see him,'' said Donald Fathers of Oxford.
   ``We are considering it,'' said Elizabeth Godsall of London, the
mother of another hostage. ``The (British) government is not doing
anything for us. ... (I say) negotiate and fetch the men home.''
   Fathers accused the British and U.S. governments of seeking war
with Iraq. He and Mrs. Godsall were speaking in television
interviews with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   In a message Thursday to former Conservative Prime Minister
Edward Heath, Saddam agreed to release Briton Rory Duncan, 19, and
his father Bruce.
   Rory's brother Alexander, 21, and an Iraqi security man were
killed in an auto accident in Kuwait; Rory was injured in it too.
Alexander's body will be released at the same time his family is
allowed to fly home.
   Rory and Alexander had been due to join 32 other Britons who
flew out of Iraq Oct. 23 after Heath, in a personal intervention
criticized by some members of Mrs. Thatcher's government, met with
Saddam in Baghdad.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Sanctions Dropping Grunseth Running Mate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The running mate of the Republican
gubernatorial candidate who dropped out of the race will not appear
on next week's ballot, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   Sharon Clark, nominated in the GOP primary with Jon Grunseth,
had asked the court to reverse a decision taking her off the ballot
and replacing her with the running mate of Grunseth's replacement.
   Grunseth's replacement, Arne Carlson, chose Joanell Dyrstad as
his running mate.
   ``They ruled Secretary of State Joan Growe was right, that the
decision to place on the ballot the team of Carlson and Dyrstad was
proper,'' said Chief Deputy Attorney General Jack Tunheim.
   Grunseth submitted an affidavit of withdrawal after dropping out
of the race Sunday amid allegations he tried to swim nude with
teen-age girls at a 1981 party and cheated on both his wives.
   Clark did not withdraw, arguing that she had the right to remain
on the ballot because she won the support of the Republican Party
and GOP voters in the primary.
   ``We're absolutely delighted,'' Carlson said. ``We feel like
we've been through the trials of Job and that has finally come to
an end.''
   Dyrstad said she and Carlson had always felt like a team. ``Now
we officially are one,'' she said. ``It's a relief.''
   Clark, in a statement read at Grunseth's former campaign
headquarters, thanked the Supreme Court for considering the case.
   ``This has been an extraordinary political year full of
firsts,'' she said.
   To Dyrstad, Clark said, ``I hope you will understand that you
and I have been caught in a situation not of our making. I had to
do what I felt was right and what I owed the primary voters.''
   Clark pledged her support to Carlson.
   The ruling delighted Growe, who had decided to take Clark off
the ballot for Tuesday's election. She said she will authorize the
printing Friday of supplemental ballots to reflect the Supreme
Court ruling.
   ``Because they acted promptly, Minnesota voters will know what
names will be on the ballot,'' Growe said. ``It's good to know the
Supreme Court agrees with the decisions you make.''
   The Supreme Court agreed with Tunheim, who argued that Dyrstad
should be Carlson's running mate because a state constitutional
amendment requires candidates for governor and lieutenant governor
in Minnesota to run as a team.

   It was no accident that officials of the Roman
Catholic Church picked Thursday, All Saints Day, to unearth the
bones of a former slave who is the first black American proposed
for sainthood.
   Cardinal John O'Connor turned the first shovelful of dirt at the
small cemetery at Old St. Patrick's Church in Little Italy. That's
where Pierre Toussaint was buried in 1853 when he died at age 87.
   Born into slavery in Haiti, Toussaint is now considered the
founder of Catholic Charities because he helped the needy for 66
years before formal services for aid existed.
   ``It would be magnificent if it could eventually be determined
that he deserves to be a saint,'' O'Connor told about 100
spectators pressed against police barricades.
   Toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to New York at age 21 by
his French owners. Still enslaved, he became a leading hairdresser
in the city and was allowed to keep some of his income.
   When Toussaint's owner died, he left an impoverished widow and
child. In a typical act of generosity, Toussaint secretly supported
them for 20 years. The widow freed Toussaint from slavery just
before she died in 1807.
   Once free, he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on
charities, including an orphanage and the city's first school for
black children. He also entered quarantined sections of the city to
help yellow fever victims. O'Connor described Toussaint as ``an
extremely holy man, a great humble man, who made a considerable
amount of money. He used that money for the poor. He visited the
poor, wherever they were. ... He gave away all his money.''
   Church officials say the case for sainthood is boosted by one
reported miracle: the recovery of a young Haitian with cancer who
refused medical care and relied solely on prayers to Toussaint.
   In 1989 the church began investigating and examining Toussaint's
life, the first formal step if he is to be canonized. The process
can take years.
   Identifying Toussaint's remains is part of that process. If he
is made a saint, his bones may be distributed to churches and other
holy places.
   Though sainthood may be far away as workmen dug deep into the
graveyard, people darted past the barricades to pocket fistfuls of
earth as keepsakes.
   Only a few bones were unearthed in the first day of digging. A
church spokesman said the project could go on for days.
   Workmen had found a portion of a jaw with teeth, said Dr. Victor
Tchertkoff, head of the Department of Pathology at New York Medical
College in Valhalla. Other small bones appeared to be from human
ribs.
   The remains will go to an anthropological pathologist, he said.
   Church officials said it was likely that the remains of
Toussaint, his wife and stepdaughter were buried in wood coffins
that have since disintegrated.
   On a piece of concrete lifted off the grave before digging
began, Toussaint was described as a Catholic black man ``respected
and revered for the integrity of his life and for his many works of
charity.''
   As O'Connor stood outside the cemetery on Thursday, he said, ``I
wish I were as holy as he.''

   The doctor of a woman who has been in a
coma for seven years testified Thursday her condition is ``a living
hell'' and the feeding tube keeping her alive should be removed.
   Dr. James Davis, who is treating Nancy Cruzan, said he changed
his mind about her death because there is no hope for recovery.
   The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by Ms. Cruzan's
parents to end her life, but the couple's lawyer went back to
court, saying he had new evidence showing she would want to die.
   ``I think it would be personally a living hell,'' Davis said
during a Circuit Court hearing of Ms. Cruzan's condition, described
as a persistent vegetative state.
   Davis was asked if he would want someone to end his life if he
was in the same condition. ``I think anyone would choose that if
they had observed that condition.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, suffered permanent brain damage when her car
overturned on a road Jan. 11, 1983.
   Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, have fought a 3-year legal
battle to have the surgically implanted tube pumping liquid food
into their daughter's stomach removed so she may die.
   The Supreme Court rejected the Cruzans' request last summer in
the court's first right-to-die decision. It ruled states could bar
removal of life-sustaining treatment from comatose patients who
have not made or cannot make their desires known.
   Judge Charles E. Teel, who ruled in the parents' favor before he
was overturned, is to rule by Jan. 1.
   ``Anyone with any common sense can understand the frustration of
seeing your kid in a situation and not being able to do anything
for her,'' Joe Cruzan testified.
   ``I dread her death,'' he said. ``It will be reliving the horror
of the accident all over again. But I look forward to it because
Nancy will be free.''
   His voice cracked when asked if he had any doubt his daughter
would choose to die. ``My God, I wouldn't be here today if I
thought there was any question,'' the father said.
   Three of Ms. Cruzan's co-workers testified she told them before
the accident she would not want to be kept alive artificially.
   Tom Turner, former owner of an Oklahoma City business where Ms.
Cruzan worked for about a month in 1981, said in videotaped
testimony they once talked about Karen Ann Quinlan.
   Ms. Quinlan lived in a similar coma-like condition nine years
after she was removed from a respirator with the New Jersey Supreme
Court's permission.
   ``Nancy was very specific about what she would want if she were
in Karen's situation. That was she would not want to be kept alive
under those circumstances,'' Turner said.
   Two co-workers at the school for the severely handicapped where
Ms. Cruzan once worked as a teacher's aide also testified.
   They said all three once agreed they would not want to be force
fed or kept on life-support equipment if they became as severely
handicapped as the children they worked with.
   ``Nancy agreed with us she wouldn't want to be tube fed or force
fed if she became that way from a car accident or some other
accident,'' said Debi Haver, a teacher.
   Dr. Clark Watts, chief of neurosurgery at the University of
Missouri-Columbia, said in a statement presented in court that Ms.
Cruzan had ``no cognition or thought'' and did not respond to pain.
Watts said her condition was irreversible.

   A suspect in a financial scandal involving East
Germany's former Communist Party was arrested in Norway on Thursday
while trying to withdraw money from a bank, officials said.
   Karl-Heinz Kaufmann, a leading official in the renamed Communist
Party, is expected to be extradited from Oslo, where he was
arrested, to Germany within days, Berlin Justice Ministry officials
said.
   Kaufmann is at the center of a scandal over the funneling of $66
million in party funds out of Germany.
   The party, now called the Party for Democratic Socialism, says
those involved were merely trying to keep the German government
from seizing the cash, a legacy from East Germany's old hard-line
regime.
   But prosecutors say the cash transfer was illegal.
   Two other party officials were arrested last week.
   Kaufmann, a prominent PDS member from Halle, is suspected of
using his business connections to move the funds to the Soviet
Union.

   Suspected Mafia kingpin Umberto Ammaturo
of Italy escaped from jail where he was awaiting extradition, the
government news agency Radiobras said Thursday.
   Ammaturo's cell at federal police headquarters in the capital
was found locked and empty, the agency said.
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest commercial network, said there was no
sign of a forced breakout. Police suspect the Italian received
inside help, the network said.
   Ammaturo, a reputed leader of the Naples-based Mafia known as
``Camorra,'' was arrested in August in the east-central city of
Governador Valadares, where he was trying to obtain a Peruvian
passport.
   Federal police investigated and found an Interpol arrest order
for the Italian.
   Ammaturo fled Italy in May 1987, police said at the time of his
arrest. He had just finished a 6-year prison term on a drug-related
charge and had been sentenced to an additional 17 years for drug
trafficking, police said.
   In Naples, Ammaturo was responsible for a drug trafficking
network between South America and Europe, police said.
   Italy has asked for Ammaturo's extradition. The Brazilian
Supreme Court must rule on the request.

   Thousands of deserters from Iraq's army
are hiding in northern Iraq or have fled to Turkey and Saudi
Arabia, an Iraqi opposition group claimed Thursday.
   The Kurdistan Democratic Party said it also had reports of a
``noticeable unease over the selective distribution of gas masks''
among the favored in Iraq.
   The KDP, based in London, faxed its statement to The Associated
Press in Nicosia. The report could not be confirmed, but
information from the group has proved reliable in the past.
   The KDP has been fighting the Iraqi government for years to
establish an independent homeland for the nation's Kurdish
minority.
   It said it had reliable information that Iraqi military
intelligence forces have moved against two powerful Arab tribes
living outside Mosul, a northern city, to arrest draftdodgers and
deserters.
   About 150 Shamer and Jebour tribesmen were arrested for refusing
to join the army, during a search operation that began Oct. 25, the
KDP said.
   ``During the operation no clashes happened, but the move has
heightened tension in the area, since both tribes are known for
their support of the government,'' the KDP said.
   ``We have also learned that the Iraqi army inside the country
and in occupied Kuwait is poorly supplied with food,'' it said.
``Tea has become a luxury, so has rice.''
   It said scores of defectors have joined the KDP guerrillas in
the north and ``others have fled across the border to Turkey and
Saudi Arabia.''
   The report said that elite troops, workers in key arms plants
and oil installations, and senior officials of the ruling Arab
Baath Socialist Party, have been given priority in the distribution
of gas masks.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Court-Martial of National Guard Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military judge Thursday canceled the
court-martial of Mississippi's top National Guard officer, saying
Gov. Ray Mabus wrongly influenced the case.
   The judge rejected allegations from the governor's office that
Adj. Gen. Arthur J. Farmer used insider information to purchase
land near Camp Shelby, which is targeted for expansion.
   Mabus reprimanded Farmer for participating in the August 1989
purchase of five acres and later suspended him.
   Judge William Eshee Jr. said Mabus used undue influence in
convening the court-martial. Eshee cited evidence that the
governor's advisers may have helped him select members of a
military court.
   The state's Code of Military Justice says the governor must
personally select members of such a court.
   Eshee also cited Mabus' placement of Gen. Bela Chain on a list
of prospective jurors. In October 1989, Farmer attempted to remove
Chain as commander of a National Guard unit in Tupelo. Farmer
testified Tuesday during a pre-trial court-martial hearing that
Mabus stepped in to prevent Chain's dismissal.
   It would have been the first military trial against a
Mississippi National Guard officer. The decision could be appealed
to the Mississippi Court of Military Appeals, a body that has never
been used.
   Farmer said he intends to resume his duties.
   ``I just want to do the duties of adjutant general and I will be
in contact with the commander in chief (Mabus) to work out those
details,'' he said.
   Eshee's ruling includes a prohibition against the federal
government reconvening a court-martial against Farmer on the same
charges.
   ``I am disappointed in the ruling, particularly given the fact
that Gen. Farmer, by his own admission, showed bad judgment in the
purchase of land adjacent to Camp Shelby,'' Mabus said in a
statement.
   Mabus said a military investigator recommended a court-martial.
   Mabus cannot fire Farmer. His dismissal would require an
impeachment trial by the Senate or an ethics conviction.
   ``Basically what this ruling by the judge says is that an
adjutant general can attempt to use his position for profit and the
military can't or won't do anything,'' Mabus said.
   Farmer, 57, of Crystal Springs and his attorneys were required
during the nearly four-day preliminary hearing to submit evidence
showing that Mabus' actions were vindictive prosecution.
   ``A reasonable person would conclude that unlawful command
influence has affected this case,'' Eshee said.
   He first announced his decision Wednesday and made it final
Thursday.
   Mabus appointed Farmer adjutant general in 1988, which placed
him in command of the state's 16,000 guardsmen.
   Mabus assumed day-to-day control of the Guard after suspending
Farmer in February. The governor ordered Farmer's court-martial
Oct. 22. Farmer continued to draw his $50,400 annual salary.

<TEXT>
   Two fishermen survived a hurricane
and 25 days adrift in an open boat by drinking rainwater collected
in pails and catching mackerel from the sea, the Coast Guard said
Thursday.
   The survivors, who set out from the French island of Martinque,
were hospitalized Thursday in San Juan suffering from dehydration
and malnutrition, the Coast Guard statement said.
   The two men, an uncle and his nephew, arrived in Puerto Rico
earlier in the day after their 25-foot boat was towed to San Juan
by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter.
   They were found Tuesday by the crew of a British sailboat about
300 miles northeast of San Juan.
   Claude Ballud, 24, and his uncle, Irmi Ballud, 57, left
Martinique on Oct. 4 for a one-day fishing trip, a Coast Guard
statement said Thursday.
   ``During the trip, their engine broke down,'' read the
statement. ``Irmi, an experienced fishermen, constructed a sail to
propel them back to the island.''
   But 90 mph winds from Hurricane Klaus, which swept across the
Caribbean in early October, ``tossed them around the ocean and
destroyed their sail, leaving them lost and their boat disabled,''
the statement said.
   The storm hit Martinique the hardest, leaving six dead and about
1,500 homeless there.
   The Coast Guard said the two fishermen ran out of water for
their last week at sea.
   The Coast Guard said Claude Ballud is suffering from severe
dehydration, exposure and malnutrition. He lost 55 pounds during
the ordeal.
   It said the uncle is in better condition but is also suffering
from dehydration and malnutrition at the Rio Piedras Medical
Center.
   Irmi Ballud reportedly wants to return to Martinique, about 350
miles to the southeast, with his fishing boat.

   A labor lawyer and adviser to striking unions of
the Daily News offered Thursday to buy the newspaper, but he was
rebuffed by its owners.
   Theodore Kheel told the Tribune Co., the owner of the News, that
he had lined up investors to help finance the purchase.
   He also said he could negotiate contracts with the unions and
work out a joint operating agreement with the New York Post.
   ``The paper is not for sale,'' News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson
said.
   Kheel refused to identify the investors or reveal his buying
price.
   Eight of the newspaper's 10 unions struck the News on Oct. 25
over what they termed unfair labor practices. They were joined a
day later by members of the Newspaper Guild.
   Violence rocked the first days of the strike when pickets
damaged buses carrying replacement workers and delivery trucks.
   A crowd of union members and supporters that police estimated at
5,000 rallied outside the Daily News' building Thursday. No arrests
or serious injuries were reported.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor sent a letter of
support to union members, saying ``I do not believe that union
members wanted to initiate the current strike.''
   In other strike-related developments, more Daily News employees
returned to work and management claimed it had printed and
distributed more than 1 million copies of the publication Thursday
as the strike entered its second week.
   Among those back at work was columnist Betty Liu Ebron, whose
byline reappeared in Thursday's editions.
   ``I just don't believe in the strategy or the (Newspaper Guild)
leadership. I couldn't let them decide for me,'' she said.
   Ms. Robinson said 250 Guild members were on the job Thursday,
including 130 of the 350-person editorial department. The Guild has
said the number of returning management workers was high.
   With more employees back at work, Daily News officials said they
published and distributed 1.06 million papers Thursday. The paper,
the third-largest metropolitan daily in the nation, normally puts
out 1.1 million copies.
   ``We believe the majority are getting into the hands of the
readers,'' Ms. Robinson said.
   The papers were hard to find. Many news vendors have reported
they have been threatened with violence if they sell the newspaper.
   A bundle of about 7,000 Daily News papers languished Thursday
afternoon in the parking lot of a Roy Rogers restaurant in Yonkers.
Police said vendors never picked them up.

   Seven passengers and four flight attendants on a
United Airlines flight from Hong Kong were injured Thursday when
turbulence rocked the Boeing 747, an airline spokeswoman said.
   The plane landed safely in Seattle shortly after noon.
Paramedics met the plane, and several passengers were transported
to hospitals.
   The injuries were minor, United spokeswoman Sarah Dornacker said
from Chicago.
   Flight 22, bound for Seattle, encountered turbulence at 38,000
feet shortly after leaving Hong Kong, Dornacker said. A doctor was
on board, and the decision was made to continue to Seattle, she
said.
   The plane carried 161 passengers, four pilots and 13 flight
attendants, she said.
   Port of Seattle spokesman Bill Anscheutz said he was not aware
of any damage to the plane.

   Lawyers picked a jury Thursday and began
testimony in a case of potty parity.
   Denise Wells, a 33-year-old legal secretary, is being tried for
using the men's restroom at a concert. Her trip to the toilet made
national news and led to talk-show appearances with Johnny Carson,
Geraldo Rivera and Joan Rivers.
   But on Thursday she was barred by her lawyer and sister, Valorie
Wells Davenport, from talking to reporters.
   At one point before the proceedings began, she went to the
women's restroom and emerged smiling while nearly a dozen
photographers clicked away.
   She was ticketed for allegedly violating a city ordinance that
bars members of one sex from using a public restroom designed for
members of the opposite sex in a manner calculated to cause a
disturbance.
   She faces up to a $200 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor.
   Some states, including New York and Virginia, have approved
so-called potty parity regulations that give women as many or more
toilets than men to compensate for the extra time that women can
take.
   In 1988, two Virginia Tech researchers with stopwatches and
questionnaires found that a woman's visit to a public restroom runs
50 percent longer than a man's.
   Ms. Davenport said her client's defense in the trial that was
expected to last at least two days would be based on a clause in
the law saying the person intended to cause a disturbance.
   ``She was just trying to go to the bathroom, not cause a
disturbance,'' Ms. Davenport said.
   Ms. Wells used the men's restroom at The Summit during the July
7 concert by country music star George Strait because the line
outside the women's restroom was too long.
   Ms. Davenport said her sister waited until intermission ended
and again tried to use the women's room, but the line was even
longer. Then, in desperation, she followed a couple into the men's
room, while the other woman's date cleared the way.
   Police officer Daniel Ramsey was working as a security guard at
The Summit when he found Ms. Wells using a men's restroom.
   Ramsey testified that he saw her coming out of a stall.
   ``She said in a voice that could be heard to the front of the
restroom, `There - I left the lid up, just like y'all like it,'''
he said.
   Ramsey said he escorted Ms. Wells out of the bathroom and cited
her.
   Potential jurors were asked if they'd ever been in a public
restroom intended for the opposite sex.
   Ten of 30 potential jurors raised their hands. Each explained
their reasons, including the same reason offered by Ms. Wells, that
there were too many women waiting for their restroom while the
men's room had toilets available.
   Ms. Wells was surrounded by family and friends who snickered at
some of the panel's responses.
   ``Let's face it. We're everywhere. We've got a woman lawyer, a
woman defendant, a woman judge, we may even have a woman
governor,'' Ms. Davenport told the panel. The last reference was to
the Democratic gubernatorial candidacy of Ann Richards.
   During questioning before Municipal Court Judge Francelia Totty,
several male jurors said they had been offended by young women who
entered men's rooms giggling and used the toilets while men were
present. But, they said, ``by the desperation in their manner'' it
was clear the women felt it was an emergency situation.
   ``Even though it's a minimal case, it's still a crime and it's
my belief and Denise's belief that she did not violate that
ordinance,'' said another lawyer for Wells, Christopher Tritico.
   Tritico said Ms. Wells did not enter the men's room to shock
anyone.
   ``I don't think the ordinance in and of itself is wrong, but the
way it is drafted, it allows people in an emergency to get
relief,'' Tritico said.
   ``She violated a city ordinance,'' said Karl Rosette, the
prosecutor. ``She entered without the permission of the person in
charge.''

<TEXT>
   CSX Transportation Corp. agreed Thursday to
pay $16 million to thousands of people who fled their homes when a
train bearing toxic phosphorus derailed and ignited on a summer day
in 1986.
   The money partly settles a lawsuit stemming from the Miamisburg
train derailment, officials said. The ensuing fire and toxic fumes
forced the evacuation of an estimated 30,000 people, some for up to
five days.
   No injuries from the fumes or fire were reported. The cause of
the accident has never been determined.
   Common Pleas Judge John Kessler said CSX agreed to put the money
in a trust fund.
   Attorney Stanley Chesley, representing evacuees in the
class-action lawsuit, said he doesn't know how many people will be
eligible for the money. Their claims range from injuries during the
evacuation to time lost from work, he said.
   Chesley said 14,000 evacuees have already settled with CSX. He
did not disclose the size of that settlement.
   Thursday's settlement came after a nearly five-week trial
stemming from the July 8, 1986, accident in which a
phosphorus-filled railroad car leaked and exploded when the
chemical hit the air.
   Chesley filed the lawsuit against CSX, the Union Tank Car Co.,
which owned the rail car, and Albright and Wilson Inc., which
leased it.
   The settlement removes CSX from the case. Union Tank Car and
Albright and Wilson remain as defendants. The jury must determine
who, if anyone, is responsible for the derailment.
   The 44-car train was coming from Quebec, Canada, heading to
Fernald, Ohio, at 45 mph when it derailed crossing a bridge south
of Miamisburg.
   The temperature that day was in the 90s. Phosphorus ignites on
contact with air that is 86 degrees or more. Its fumes can cause
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and can burn the skin and eyes on
contact. It can also be fatal.
   James O'Connell, a CSX attorney, said the railroad denies
responsibility but decided to make the settlement any way.
   ``CSX had denied liability throughout these proceedings and
continues to do so,'' O'Connell said. ``However, an amicable
resolution ... is in most instances the best possible result, and
we felt that the settlement that has now been negotiated was a
significant one under all of the circumstances.''

   State Attorney General Steven Clark was
convicted Thursday of abusing his expense privileges. He was fined
$10,000 but drew no prison time.
   ``Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' Clark said after the
verdict was announced. ``As I've said all along, it was never my
intention to defraud or deceive.''
   Judge Perry V. Whitmore fined Clark $10,000 but did not sentence
him to jail, which Clark's lawyer said would be a death sentence
for Arkansas' top legal official.
   ``Even though you are attorney general - in this respect I feel
ridiculous - but I must tell you, you can appeal,'' Whitmore said.
   The corruption trial went to the jury earlier in the day after a
prosecutor compared the attorney general's ambitions to a runaway
train fueled by state money.
   ``The General was feeding that train. And as he was feeding that
train, to keep his gubernatorial campaign alive, he'd throw coal
in. That coal is your money,'' prosecutor Chris Piazza told jurors
in closing arguments.
   Clark, 43, was convicted of a less severe charge. He was charged
with theft by deception of more than $2,500, which carried a
maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a $15,000 fine. Clark was
convicted of theft by deception of less than $2,500, which carried
a maximum penalty of three to 10 years in prison and a $15,000
fine.
   Piazza said after the verdict was announced: ``I don't ever
regret a jury verdict.''
   Earlier, Piazza said Clark was consumed by his dream to become
governor but couldn't afford to entertain political supporters and
generate campaign contributions without the help of state money
through his expense account and state credit card.
   Defense attorney Bill Bristow said Clark already had lost.
   ``Another jury has already issued a verdict to Steve Clark. That
is the jury of public opinion,'' Bristow said.
   ``Steve Clark has been the subject of ridicule. `Let's go to
lunch' is a statewide joke,'' Bristow said. ``Steve Clark's
political dream - the dream to be governor - is gone.
   ``If Steve Clark ran for dog catcher right now, he'd lose to a
write-in candidate.''
   Clark, attorney general since 1979, earns $26,500 a year plus a
$15,000 salary supplement.
   Published reports of discrepancies in his expense reports
prompted Clark to drop out of the Democratic gubernatorial primary
Feb. 7.
   Piazza said Clark ``lived off the state.''
   He said Clark stayed at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tenn.,
with a girlfriend. ``He stayed there on your money. You paid for
him and her to have room service,'' Piazza said.
   Bristow said Clark might be liable for civil penalties if he
used poor judgment, but insisted that Clark didn't break any laws.
   ``What you're going to see is unauthorized use of funds, not
stealing,'' Bristow said.
   He said there was little or no restriction on Clark's use of the
state Visa card.
   Clark testified he never intended to deceive anyone with his
expense filings.
   Under cross-examination Wednesday, Clark said he was doing more
than the law required by keeping expense records. No other top
state official does so, he said.
   ``If I wanted to deceive anyone, I wouldn't have done anything
and I certainly wouldn't have used the names of prominent people so
people could come in and say, `Steve Clark says he ate with you, is
that right?''' Clark said.
   Among the prosecution's 141 witnesses, state Supreme Court
Justice Jack Holt, several state legislators, lobbyists and
reporters testified that they didn't eat with Clark, although their
names were on his expense claims.
   Clark claimed he accidentally listed as guests people he talked
with at the restaurants, met earlier in the day or who were topics
of discussion at meals. He said he waited weeks to update expense
records from memory or notes.
   Clark denied the state's theory that he name-dropped on his
expense claims to hide dates, getaways and political engagements
from taxpayers who footed the bills.
   Piazza said the attorney general made up the names of guests so
the expensive meals - some more than $500 - would appear to be
legitimate state business.
   ``For your political life, didn't you have to justify $500
meals? Were you not concerned about how it would look if you spend
$500 to take a girlfriend and her family out to dinner?'' Piazza
said.
   Juror Brenda Beall, 27, of North Little Rock said the decision
was fair to Clark and to taxpayers.
   ``I didn't want to see the man go to prison. My God, he has
suffered enough, but we didn't want him to get away with taking our
money - your money, my money,'' she said.
   ``I don't feel in my heart that he is the only one who did this.
The only difference between him and everybody else is he got
caught,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Ex-heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson won a
unanimous decision Thursday when a jury decided he should pay no
punitive damages for fondling a woman in a disco.
   The U.S. District Court jury of five women and one man
deliberated less than an hour before deciding Tyson did not have to
pay Sandra Miller additional damages. She had sought $2.5 million
as punishment for the Dec. 10, 1988, incident at Bentley's Disco in
Manhattan.
   A day earlier, the jurors ordered Tyson to pay $100 in
compensatory damages.
   ``I'm just happy they saw it as the truth,'' said Tyson, who
denied the incident ever happened.
   Supporters, including boxing promoter Don King, swarmed around
Tyson in the courtroom, congratulating him. He jokingly pulled a
$100 bill from his pocket and placed it on his forehead.
   The jurors left the courthouse without talking to reporters.
   Miller said she was was happy with the outcome, money or not.
``It was the principle,'' she said. ``He knows he did it. I know he
did it. The jury proved that he did it.''
   But she said she felt Tyson would continue hassling women. ``He
hasn't learned his lesson. There's no stopping Mike Tyson.''
   The jury ruled Wednesday that Tyson grabbed Miller's breasts and
buttocks after she refused his advances. The finding that Tyson
committed battery cleared the way for a determination of punitive
damages.
   Tyson has acknowledged that he was at Bentley's but denies
knowing or ever touching Miller, a 26-year old Queens computer
operator.
   In testimony Thursday, Tyson also denied grabbing another
woman's behind that same night at the club.
   Judge Michael B. Mukasey allowed Miller's attorney, Alan Clark,
to present testimony about the other incident to show that Miller's
claims were not isolated.
   The second woman, Lori Davis, testified that she felt someone
clutch under her dress as she was dancing at Bentley's.
   She said she turned and warned him not to try it again. ``Then
it dawned on me that it was Mike Tyson,'' she said. ``He was
grabbing my butt. I felt humiliated, violated, disgraced and
petrified.''
   Davis, a 31-year-old mental health therapist, has a $7 million
lawsuit against Tyson pending in state court on Long Island.
   Clark also questioned Tyson about a financial statement that
placed his net worth at $15 million as of Feb. 28.
   The document showed that Tyson owns a $6 million mansion in
Bernardsville, N.J., and cars worth more than $840,000.
   Tyson said he made more than $20 million in 1989 but testified
that he didn't know his income for this year. ``I had a bad year
this year,'' he said, an apparent reference to his defeat in
February by James ``Buster'' Douglas.
   Under questioning by his attorney, Robert Hirth, Tyson said he
felt no ill will toward women. ``My mother's a woman and my
sister's a woman,'' he said.
   The civil case was tried in Manhattan's federal court because
Tyson's legal residence is in Ohio and Miller lives in New York.

   Two bombs set by anti-imperial extremists rocked a
Tokyo police dormitory late Thursday, killing an officer and
injuring six people, police said Friday.
   The Metropolitan Police Department also found explosives at a
second dormitory and a public restroom in western Tokyo early
Friday. In central Japan, a gas bomb was lobbed at a police station
before dawn Friday, but no injuries were reported.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told reporters the blasts were
``extremely regrettable and unforgivable.''
   Misoji Sakamoto, the government's chief spokesman, said the
attackers were guilty of a ``despicable'' act that called for ``all
available legal measures to uproot terrorism.''
   Police say they suspect the involvement of radicals, but no
group immediately claimed responsibility.
   The attack comes as Japan is mobilizing its largest security
operation to stave off violence by anti-imperial extremists who
have vowed to disrupt the enthronement ceremonies of Emperor
Akihito.
   The Nov. 12 civil coronation is to be attended by
representatives from more than 150 countries, including Vice
President Quayle and Prince Charles of Britain.
   A police official said the three incidents were being viewed as
a single campaign by the extremists.
   Police identified the dead officer as Hiroshi Aoki, 48. He died
almost immediately after the two blasts, just before 11 p.m.,
ripped through the dormitory in Shinjuku, a bustling district that
is one of Tokyo's most popular nightspots.
   Two officers were injured, one with a serious burn on the back
of his left leg and the other with a broken left arm and two broken
legs, according to a Metropolitan Police Department official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the dorm's cook, his son and two other police officers
also were injured.
   The police official said the type of explosives and other
details of the blast were under investigation. The bombs had been
placed near a garbage collection area inside the dormitory complex,
officials said.
   Police forces are very ``angry about the extremists' attempts''
and will continue to tighten security for the ceremony to counter
the extremists' challenge, the official said.
   Left-wing extremists are against the institution of the emperor,
which they view as the core of imperialist sentiments among
conservative Japanese.
   About 26,000 police already are on security-related assignments
in the capital as the enthronement approaches. Further
reinforcements would bring the total number of officers deployed in
Tokyo for security to 37,000 on the day of the coronation.

   A state legislator was sentenced
Thursday to five years in prison and ordered to pay $48,000 in
restitution for setting up an illegal bingo hall in 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Higgins sentenced Rep. Tommy Burnett,
once one of the most powerful Democrats in the Legislature, on
charges of illegal gambling, conspiracy and six counts of mail
fraud.
   He said he would wait to sentence Burnett, 48, on an additional
mail fraud conviction until he served the five-year prison term.
   ``It's a sad, sad day,'' Burnett told reporters. ``I think you
always feel bad when something like this happens in your life.''
   Burnett's lawyer Bob Lynch, in arguments before Higgins,
characterized Burnett as an enigma - a popular, successful
legislator and lawyer who could not manage his personal finances
and fell deeply into debt.
   ``Perhaps I am,'' Burnett said when asked later by a reporter
about the description. ``Perhaps sometimes I can do good things and
sometimes I can do stupid things.''
   Burnett must report for prison Jan. 2.
   Burnett faced up to 45 years in prison and fines of up to $1.75
million. He remains a member of the state House of Representatives
until the Nov. 6 general election. He dropped out of the Democratic
primary for re-election to the seat he held for 20 years and has
lost his law license because of the felony convictions.
   Burnett stood with folded arms and fought back tears as Higgins
imposed the sentence.
   ``Mr. Burnett stands before this court a broken man. I can't
think of another better example of a broken man,'' Lynch said.
   Higgins called the case a ``classic example of basic right and
wrong'' and said Burnett had ``clearly stepped over the line.''
   He said Burnett failed to ``pay the piper'' when he served 10
months in federal prison in 1984 for failing to pay his income
taxes in a timely manner, a misdemeanor. He was on probation when
the latest charges were filed.
   The $48,000 in restitution must be paid to Florida businessman
Joseph Cappello, who served time with Burnett at Maxwell Air Force
Base prison camp. Cappello testified at the trial he gave Burnett
money to set up a bingo hall in Crossville.
   Lynch would not comment on the sentence, but he said he will
appeal.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Washko, who prosecuted the case,
called it a tragedy.
   ``It's a tragedy that stems from a life of financial
difficulties. A lot of it stemmed from is deep indebtedness,''
Washko told reporters.
   Washko said he will wait until Burnett becomes eligible for
parole before deciding whether he will oppose Burnett's early
release from prison.
   Burnett was named in a 10-count indictment that accused him of
conspiracy, illegal gambling, mail fraud and perjury.
   Also named in that indictment were Knoxville bingo operator
Virginia Hurst and Columbia businessman E.E. Shutt, who were
accused of illegal gambling and conspiracy.
   Mrs. Hurst was sentenced to five years probation and community
service and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine. Shutt is serving a
two-year prison sentence for his role in setting up the Crossville

   Iraqi troops seized scores of documents when
they invaded Kuwait, but the papers are unlikely to compromise the
United States because of Kuwait's limited intelligence service,
officials and private analysts say.
   ``They obviously got a lot of documents,'' said Ali Al-Sabah, a
spokesman for the Kuwait Embassy. ``They have to sift through them
and they have the labor to do that.''
   Attention focused on Kuwaiti documents Wednesday when Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat released one he said was taken from
files at Kuwait's internal security bureau after the Aug. 2
invasion.
   But officials said the fact that the documents belonged to
Kuwait makes the situation different from 1979, when Iranian
revolutionaries seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Five years after it started withholding dues
from the United Nations to force a belt-tightening in the world
organization, the United States is paying up.
   The 101st Congress, in its final days, passed legislation to pay
nearly $800 million in current and back dues owed to the United
Nations, its specialized agencies and other international and
regional bodies to which the United States belongs. President Bush
has indicated he will sign the bill.
   The United States pays one-fourth the cost of U.N. operations,
the largest share of any country.
   The congressional action ``underscores the increasingly
important role the United Nations is playing in a changing world,''
Assistant Secretary of State John R. Bolton said Wednesday.

   BOSTON (AP) - In a few years, college-bound students will have
to give their own answers to some Scholastic Aptitude Test math
problems instead of picking from multiple choices. But they'll be
able to use a calculator.
   Those are among changes announced Wednesday by the College
Board, sponsor of the SAT, the most widely used college entrance
exam in the nation.
   The revisions - the most drastic in the test's 64-year history -
also include more emphasis on reading comprehension. The revised
SAT, called SAT-I, will be introduced in 1994, board President
Donald M. Stewart said.
   In addition, an optional test, known as the SAT-II, will be
phased in starting next year and will include an essay section.

   ATLANTA (AP) - Atlanta's rapid transit system is beckoning to
booming suburban Gwinnett County, but some voters there want to
derail the expansion because of fears that blacks from the city
will stream out on buses and trains.
   Others say they simply don't want to pay for it.
   Gwinnett County voters decide Nov. 6 whether to bring the
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority into the county in
exchange for a 1 percent sales tax.
   County Commissioner W.J. Dodd said his constituents oppose the
idea, and he predicted it would fail.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Women and black candidates are fighting to
change the political landscape in high-profile races that could see
them take over three governorships and several seats in Congress.
   National attention is focused on black candidate Harvey Gantt's
strong bid to unseat Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and the big-state
gubernatorial candidacies of Ann Richards in Texas and Dianne
Feinstein in California.
   A raft of women and blacks are seeking office at the
congressional and state levels.
   Women's groups are pleased with the number of female candidates
seeking statewide office in Tuesday's election - 85 in all,
according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics.
   Black candidates for statewide and federal office number 52,
including 21 incumbents, according to figures compiled by the Joint
Center for Political Studies. The research organization tracks
black politics.

   CHICAGO (AP) - When Jim Adduci settles into class with a bunch
of 20-year-old college students, he feels a little odd. Same thing
when he suits up in a minor league baseball clubhouse.
   ``Being 31 and in the minor leagues is like being 31 and a
student,'' he says.
   Nonetheless, Adduci got out the books this fall after packing up
his glove and spikes at the end of the season with the Scranton,
Pa., Triple A ballclub.
   Like thousands of other athletes, Adduci cut short his college
education to turn pro. Now he's trying to make up for it through an
80-college consortium that makes it easier for athletes to transfer
credits, attend class, find scholarships and earn their degrees.

<DATELINE>KANKESANTHURAI, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soldiers in camouflage gear lay
on their bellies, firing automatic rifles and mortars into the
scrub jungle at Tamil rebel positions.
   Overhead, the whine of a Sia-Marchetti attack plane grew louder
as it dive-bombed a bunker. A burst of .50-caliber machine gun fire
from a Bell Ranger helicopter slammed into concrete.
   Tamil Tiger rebels replied with automatic rifles, the bullets
kicking up turf and chipping bits from the walls of a Hindu temple.
The skirmish was about 1,000 yards from Kankesanthurai, a port town
on the rebel-controlled Jaffna Peninsula in northern Sri Lanka.
   ``There are only eight to 10 rebels, but they are well
entrenched in concrete bunkers,'' Maj. Deepal Subasinghe said,
ducking behind the temple wall.
   ``Earlier, there were about 30 rebels armed with mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and rifles, but we forced them to
withdraw from this temple.''
   Subasinghe's mission was the final phase of a week-long
operation, carried out during the monsoon rains of October to
secure and link three army positions that had been isolated for
four months, under rebel siege.
   The operation was called Jaya Shakthi, ``victorious strength''
in Sinhalese. The government said its forces captured 16 square
miles in an arc from the military airstrip at Palali to
Kankesanthurai harbor.
   It was one of the largest battles in the recent resumption of
the 7-year-old civil war by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
The rebels are fighting for a Tamil nation in the northern and
eastern part of the island, where the ethnic minority predominates.
   Reporters taken to the captured zone were shown fortified
bunkers of concrete and steel, and a maze of underground
communication trenches and tunnels that linked nearly all the
homes.
   ``We have shifted our defense positions around the airstrip,
giving us a secure area to land aircraft uninterrupted,'' said Lt.
Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa, commander of the northern province.
   Three battalions - 3,000 soldiers - began the operation with an
advance south of the airstrip. A column broke out to the northeast
and another force moved northwest to relieve the garrison at
Kankesanthurai, four miles from the airstrip.
   At least 117 rebels and 22 soldiers were killed in the week of
fighting, Kobbekaduwa said.
   ``Troops suffered 170 injured, but only 17 can be considered
serious,'' he told reporters at the Palali airstrip while a field
cannon boomed in the distance.
   A statement from the rebel office in Europe said 100 civilians
were killed and 200 wounded, and that at least 32 villages were
destroyed. The rebels said 100 soldiers were killed, and
acknowledged losing 36 Tamil fighters.
   No civilians were seen in any of the areas visited. Military
officials said they had been warned and left before the fighting.
   Evidence of the guerrillas was everywhere. The floor of a
two-story school at Vasavilan had been dug out to make underground
bunkers.
   Unopened lunch packets, clothing and other personnel belongings
were strewn in bunkers, indicating a hasty retreat.
   ``They fought a series of defensive battles from bunker to
bunker before withdrawing,'' said Lt. Col. Abdul Zahir.
   This was clear at the Hindu temple, where reporters had to
crouch and run about 50 yards, dodging rebel bullets, to reach a
forward position. The Tigers had vacated bunkers in front of the
temple, falling back to others at Kiramala village about a mile
away.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the Tamil rebellion
since it began in 1983.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, claim discrimination in jobs,
education and land policy by the Sinhalese, who are predominantly
Buddhist. Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people and 75 percent are Sinhalese.
   In May 1989, the rebels accepted President Ranasinghe
Premadasa's offer to negotiate. The resulting truce was shattered
June 11 when the guerrillas overran several police stations and
military camps in the Tamil region.
   Kobbekaduwa estimated 2,000 rebels were operating on the Jaffna
Peninsula, about one-fourth of the guerrilla force active in Sri
Lanka. He claimed 2,000 had been killed or seriously wounded since
June.
   When asked how he planned to hold the recaptured area, the
general replied:
   ``I am not interested in real estate. We want the rebels to
come. We will ambush them and destroy them gradually.''

<HEAD>Gold Sales Become Political Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Uruguayans look upon the central
bank's thousands of gold ingots as symbols of past prosperity and
future promise. The government sees them as a way to reduce the
deficit.
   A spirited argument has arisen over a new policy of exchanging
ingots for cash on a ``swap'' basis that gives the government the
right to reclaim the gold later.
   ``This is the national patrimony,'' said Ricardo Lombardo of the
opposition Colorado Party. He said the policy ``compromises not
just the past ... but also the future,'' and ``demands'' public
debate.
   Uruguay is a small country, with only 3 million people, but has
one of Latin America's largest stocks of gold: 3.1 million ounces,
about one ounce per citizen, worth more than $1 billion.
   It was earned, for the most part, by beef and grain exports in
the first half of the century, when Uruguay's high standard of
living and comprehensive social welfare programs made it known as
the ``Switzerland of South America.''
   The gold lay in the vaults for decades, but the central bank has
swapped 214,000 ounces for cash in three transactions since
President Luis Lacalle took office in March, and prepared for
others by shipping 800,000 ounces to overseas banks.
   Swap arrangements allow the government to reclaim the gold by
agreed dates.
   Lombardo, one of three central bank directors, said the
government lost $732,000 in the first buyback, of nearly 60,000
ounces on Oct. 30. The gold was immediately swapped the gold out
again.
   The purpose of the swaps is to convert an unproductive asset
into an investment - a basket of foreign currencies, for example -
that can earn interest or other revenue and help with the deficit.
   Another possibility is to use some of the cash to reduce the
foreign debt, now $6.9 billion. Foreign banks to which Uruguay owes
$1.6 billion agreed last month to sell the debt at its secondary
market value, about half the face amount.
   ``We can't have a pile of gold in the bank and make
genuflections or some ritual of a barbarian religion before it,''
said Ramon Diaz, president of the central bank. ``We have to see
what the world is doing, what other countries are doing, to deal
with gold as an asset.''
   When Lacalle took office, the deficit was 6.1 percent of the
gross national product, a prime cause of rising inflation that
reached 15 percent for September alone.
   Repaying the foreign debt, which Uruguay has done regularly,
costs nearly $300 million a year. Few new resources are available
to finance the government and pay the debt.
   Even supporters in the president's National Party are nervous
about the gold swaps.
   Sen. Manuel Singlet described the transactions as ``irregular''
and said, ``The public interest cannot be managed this way.''
   Lacalle, central bank president Diaz and Economy Minister
Enrique Braga have refused to say whether the government will buy
back more swapped gold.
   ``It is an asset of the country, part of the national patrimony
which we can sell if it's more convenient to have ... foreign
exchange than gold,'' Diaz said.
   If cash from the sale of gold is used to buy Uruguay's debt back
at half price, he said, ``that would be like selling the gold for
more than $700 an ounce.''
   Sen. Daniel Astori of the leftist Broad Front coalition, an
economist, spoke for the opposition: ``Uruguay should not be left
without gold reserves in order to pay the foreign debt with private
banks.''

<HEAD>`Good Morning America' Turns 15 Years Old Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a little before 7 a.m. and weatherman
Spencer Christian gestures at the bright blue backdrop while the
magic of television cooks up the maps and graphics you see at home.
   ``Good Morning America,'' which celebrates its 15th birthday
Friday, is about to go onto the air. Christian is doing the weather
wrapup for ABC's early morning news, which originates in another
studio.
   If you don't get into live TV studios very often, the surreal
aspects of a grown man gesturing at a blank wall are quite droll.
If you don't get up that early, it's not funny. It's not funny at
all.
   ``You never get over the adversity of sleep deprivation,'' he
tells a bleary-eyed visitor, smiling broadly. ``Imagine getting up
every morning at 3:45 a.m., no matter what you've done the night
before.''
   Maybe it would make you gesture at blank walls, eh?
   Since Nov. 2, 1975, ``GMA'' has originated from the soothing
dimness of ABC's cavernous Television Studio Number Two off Central
Park on Manhattan's lower Upper West Side.
   The show, with host David Hartman and co-host Nancy Dussault,
was designed by ABC's entertainment division as a lighter,
feature-driven competitor for NBC News' aging ``Today'' show, which
had been on the air since Jan. 14, 1952.
   The new show beat ``Today'' in the ratings, but ``Today'' got
anchor Bryant Gumbel in 1982 and fought its way back on top.
Hartman, who left in 1987, is expected back on TV in 1991 with a
syndicated, weekday magazine show.
   ``Today'' was No. 1 from 1985 on, with ``GMA'' a strong second
overall, beating the NBC show in key markets and demographic
groups. By 1989, ``Today'' was fading and ``GMA'' gaining.
   Gumbel's infamous 1989 memorandum blasting other ``Today''
talent made public the show's internal strains. When executives
engineered the departure of popular and longtime co-host Jane
Pauley, ``Today'' slipped into No. 2.
   It's stayed there for 43 consecutive weeks.
   Today there's laughter and easy banter on the ``GMA'' set. Its
cocoa browns, pink pastels and blond furniture are as familiar to
some Americans as their own living rooms - and much more
comfortable at 7 a.m.
   The co-hosts settle into the tan couch before two big, low-slung
cameras, cross-angled for head-and-shoulders shots. The floor
director relays the countdown, silent for the last three seconds.
The camera's red light goes on.
   ``Good Morning, America, I'm Joan Lunden,'' she says.
   ``And I'm Charles Gibson,'' he says, and another edition of
``Good Morning America'' has begun.
   Two hours later, Gibson has interviewed White House chief of
staff John Sununu; Ms. Lunden has interviewed a Houston woman cited
for using a stadium men's room. And the final, hour-long segment of
a series on AIDS has aired.
   The showis over and Ms. Lunden, Gibson and Christian are
relaxing on the set. None of them has been with the show from the
start.
   Ms. Lunden began as a consumer reporter in 1980. Christian
joined in 1986, and Gibson took over from Hartman in 1987. With the
departure of Jane Pauley, Ms. Lunden has become the longest-serving
woman on morning television.
   ``I live here,'' she said. ``I just come down in the morning and
dust off the sofa.''
   All three acknowledge that their show's stability has
contributed to its dominance in the ratings.
   ``I think at this time period in the morning, stability and
consistency is always crucial,'' Ms. Lunden said. ``People ...
don't like change. It's that one time period of the day that you
don't have the freedom to fool around with it and change things.''
   And the easygoing amiability that emanates from them doesn't
fade when the camera goes dark. They seem genuinely to like one
another.
   ``Are we conscious of the fact that it's necessary to maintain a
harmonious relationship?'' said Gibson. ``Absolutely. Sure. You
have to sublimate your ego, which for Spencer and I is very easy,
but for Joan is very difficult.''
   Barruump-bump!
   ``You talk about moody!'' Christian pitches in. ``We never know
which Joan Lunden's going to show up! You talk about the seven
faces of Eve, how about the 15 faces of ....'' The laughter bubbles
out of them.
   It's good to be No. 1 in the morning ratings, Gibson said, but
no one assumes ``GMA'' can't get knocked out of the top slot.
   ``It'll happen,'' he said. ``People will get tired of us and
we'll move off. And hopefully we'll be as sanguine about moving in
another direction as we were about the move up.''

   ``HAMLET'' RETURNS TO PBS - Kevin Kline stars tonight on PBS in
William Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet, a prince of Denmark.
   It's also his debut as a director on television, in the role
that won him an Obie award when he directed himself in the title
role onstage.
   This sumptuous modern-dress TV production, is a fine piece of
work, beautifully adapted to the strengths and limitations of
television. It's dark, intimate, obsessive.

<HEAD>Peter Kann: Taking Charge at Dow Jones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly designated leader at Dow Jones &amp; Co.
Inc. won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting at The Wall Street Journal,
launched the paper's Asian edition and spent a decade apprenticing
to the boss at the publishing and business information giant.
   But on a wall in his corner office, Peter R. Kann displays a
whimsical drawing of a speckled green fish wrapped in a copy of the
Journal.
   The Journal publisher, selected earlier this month to succeed
retiring Warren H. Phillips as chief executive of Dow Jones on Jan.
1, is known as a smart, low-key and affable man who doesn't take
himself too seriously.
   ``He has a fun-loving streak that makes him a lot of fun to be
around,'' said the Journal's Washington bureau chief Albert Hunt.
   Kann, 47, once led Wall Street Journal bureau chiefs on
late-night golf cart races on a Florida golf course. He lost $700
to the paper's bureau chiefs in a more recent poker game.
   Hunt recalls taking Kann, by then a Dow Jones executive, on a
1980 campaign trip with presidential candidate Ronald Reagan.
   Kann had complained to Hunt that the Washington press corps
wasn't tough enough in its questioning of Reagan, so Hunt deferred
to Kann when the pair was invited into Reagan's cabin on a flight
between appearances.
   ``Pizza was being served as we walked in, and they spent the
whole time talking about pizza,'' Hunt recalls.
   Kann grins when the story is recounted and concedes he ``got
taken in'' by Reagan's affability.
   Nonetheless, Kann's associates say he is a good listener, a
shrewd judge of people, a quick study and an able improvisor who
gets the job done.
   Former Wall Street Journal reporter Seth Lipsky told the story
of how Kann got past a skeptical border guard while on assignment
covering the war in Southeast Asia in the 1970s. After the guard
rejected every legitimate identification pass offered, Kann made a
big flourish and produced a flashy new gasoline credit card. That
impressed the guard, who let him pass.
   The ability to improvise may serve Kann well as he tries to
steer Dow Jones through turbulent economic times and toward global
growth.
   The slump in the financial services industry has staggered Dow
Jones' earnings. Operating earnings were off 41.4 percent in the
third quarter and 31.1 percent for the first nine months of the
year.
   Advertising volume has fallen at the Journal, Barron's and the
Ottaway Newspapers subsidiary. Losses are mounting from a new
foreign exchange trading system at the company's Telerate financial
information division.
   The company recently asked its divisions to hold 1991 spending
at 1990 levels and boosted the Journal's cover price. Nonetheless,
Moody's Investors Service Inc. cut its ratings this week on $200
million in Dow Jones debt.
   Kann said in an interview he is optimistic that Dow Jones will
bounce back when the economy rebounds. Global expansion also will
help, he said.
   The Journal, for instance, became the largest circulation daily
newspaper in the United States despite competition from three
national newspapers - USA Today, Investors Daily and the national
edition of The New York Times - and intensified business coverage
by local papers, he said. The growth also came despite corporate
consolidations that eliminated jobs for thousands of middle
managers who were avid Journal readers, he said.
   ``The paper has done pretty well in a very tough five-year
period and it has an awful lot of potential to grow again in every
sense,'' he said.
   But is an executive who grew up on the editorial side of the
business best qualified to guide a company that last year got 57
percent of its earnings from electronic information services?
   Kann's supporters note Dow Jones has a tradition of having
ex-editorial staffers at the helm, and say the experience makes
them better top executives.
   The son of a history professor, Kann was graduated from Harvard.
He joined the Journal as an intern in 1963 in San Francisco, worked
in the Pittsburgh and Los Angeles bureaus and became a Vietnam War
correspondent in 1967. His Pulitzer Prize in 1972 was for coverage
of the war between India and Pakistan.
   The Journal started an Asian edition in 1976, and Kann became
editor and publisher. ``It didn't seem ision that
would affect the rest of my career at the time,'' he recalled.
   Three years later, Kann came home as assistant to the chairman,
Phillips. He is succeeding Phillips as chief executive and it is
widely expected he will becomsuch a grand dece chairman as well when Phillips
retires from that post in July 1991.
   Kann became associate publisher of the Journal in 1979 and took
on increasing responsibility within Dow Jones. He became publisher
of the Journal in early 1989, a position he retains, and was
elected president and chief operating officer of Dow Jones in July
1989.
   ``There never was any feeling there was a ceiling on his
potential,'' said James Riordan, who has been a Dow Jones board
member for more than 20 years.
   Kann is married to Karen Elliott House, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
reporter for the Journal who is now vice president of Dow Jones'
international group. They live with three children in Princeton,
N.J.
   Kann said while ther by occupying
Iraqi troops.
   Bush has made no secret of the fact that he would like to see
Saddam out of power, but has not made that a stated objective for
the U.S. military deployed in the gulf. Their mission, he has said,
is merely to push Saddam to remove his troops from Kuwait and
restore the previous government there.
   However, Vice President Dan Quayle on Wednesday said in an
interview on PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour, ``You cannot simply
allow Saddam Hussein to have this military power and have the
technology into the future.''
   ``I believe that the world certainly understands that. A Saddam
Hussein who has ballistic missiles, who has chemical capability,
biological capability, who would like to have the nuclear
capability, cannot continue to have that capability even if he
withdraws from Kuwait,'' Quayle said.
   Deputy National Security Adviser Bob Gates, traveling with Bush
on Thursday, said Quayle's comments did not indicate a shift in
U.S. objectives.
   Bush spent the first half of his day at campaign appearances in
Burlington and Mashpee, Massachusetts, for GOP gubernatorial
candidate William Weld and Senate candidate James Rappaport. After
stopping in Florida and then Cincinnati, he was traveling Friday to
Minnesota, Iowa and California.
   Bush on Thursday spent less time blasting Democrats on budget
and other issues and more talking about the gulf crisis.
   ``I want you to put politics aside,'' he told an audience in
Mashpee.
   Fitzwater said that Bush was urged to continue his attack on
Democrats ``in certain quarters ... but he surveyed the whole
matter and decided this was the best approach.''
   The gulf matter, said Fitzwater, ``is a very serious and far
reaching problem,'' and the president wanted to talk about it to
his audiences despite the potential for allegations that he was
politicizing the crisis.
   ``We want a public debate'' over new developments in the Persian
Gulf, Fitzwater said.
   As to Saddam offer to allow hostage families to visit their
relatives in Iraq and occupied Kuwait over the Christmas holidays,
Fitzwater called it Saddam's ``latest ploy'' and said it would be
better for the Iraqi to let the hostages come home for
Thanksgiving.

<BYLINE>Cold War Is Over; Where Are All the Spies?
^By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cold War is over, but not all the spies have
come in.
   Markus Wolf, the East German master spy, may be in Moscow, maybe
not. Klaus Kuron, who tracked Wolf's operatives for West Germany,
is accused of being a double agent.
   Germany was a crossroads for spies in the 1930s and became a
hive of espionage after World War II, when Hitler's secret agents
went to work for East or West, depending on where they were
captured.
   Spies penetrated the highest ranks on both sides; a West German
chancellor was brought down when his top aide was exposed as a
Communist agent. There was a saying in intelligence circles that
West Germany had more spies per acre than any place in the world.
   Some were captured and exchanged. They walked across Glienicke,
the ``bridge of spies'' that spans the Havel River, passing each
other without turning their heads. It is easy to imagine the ghosts
of George Smiley and Karla lurking there on a silent, snowy night.
   What of the future? Cold War or no, Germany is the center of
Europe, the powerhouse that will drive the continent. Whether for
industrial, political or military purposes, the spies are certain
to be here.
   Lutz Stavenhagen, security aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
believes some will be from Moscow because what goes on in the new
Germany is ``of enormous interest for the Soviets.''
   Even Bonn, the dowdy little capital on the Rhine, has long
exuded an atmosphere of intrigue.
   Communist spies infiltrated government offices, including the
chancellery. Guenter Guillaume attached himself to Chancellor Willy
Brandt, the architect of ``ostpolitik,'' the opening the the East,
and Brandt was forced to resign in 1974.
   During the war, the Allies had secret agents in the Third Reich,
gathering intelligence and aiding the resistance.
   Immediately afterward, Berlin was infested with spies, a window
of easy passage for agents hunting secrets.
   It was ``the most productive intelligence collection center in
the world,'' Peter Wyden, a German-born American author, wrote in
``Wall,'' published just before the Berlin Wall was opened last
year.
   ``Counting the delegations from Greece and Norway, 86 separate
intelligence operations stumbled over each other's tracks'' in
Berlin, he said.
   Wyden wrote that the CIA alone had 40 ``safe houses'' in Berlin
at one time, as shelters and meeting places for control officers
and their agents.
   In the mid-1950s, the CIA and Britain's MI6 undertook one of the
most extraordinary espionage operations of the Cold War, digging a
tunnel from which they tapped communications between KGB
headquarters in East Berlin and Moscow.
   According to Wyden and some other writers, the Soviets knew of
the operation and played along to protect an important ``mole'' in
Western intelligence.
   Many writers, John le Carre and Wyden among them, have
questioned the competence of Western intelligence operations in
Berlin. Wyden, for example, points out that the West was surprised
when the wall went up in August 1961.
   Le Carre transformed spies from superheroes into lonely men
plying a questionable trade. Perhaps his most dramatic evocation of
the image was in ``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' when the
aging British agent Leamas and an innocent friend are shot down at
the wall, victims of a double cross.
   The list of real spies who found fame, infamy or death in
Germany seems endless.
   There was George Blake, a British agent unmasked in 1960 as one
of the most damaging sources of information for the KGB.
   Heinz ``Fiffi'' Felfe, a former Nazi SS officer hired by West
German intelligence, was considered one of the finest spy fighters
- until 1961, when he was found to be a double agent for the KGB.
   Wolf, the master spy known as ``Misha,'' ran a string of agents
and ``moles'' in West Germany who got their hands on some of NATO's
most precious secrets.
   He scored coup after coup in West Germany, sending East German
agents across the border as refugees to infiltrate government,
intelligence and industry. Wolf ran Guillaume, who ended Brandt's
career as chancellor.
   If East German agents couldn't get into the government
themselves, they went after people already there.
   Intelligence officials tell of one ``Romeo'' agent who used
several aliases in seducing West German government secretaries to
obtain secrets.
   In June at Koblenz, Clyde Lee Conrad, a retired U.S. Army
sergeant, was convicted of treason for spying. Conrad, who had been
in charge of a vault filled with classified documents, was part of
a ring that sold Army and NATO secrets to the Soviet bloc.
   Betraying the information could have started a world war, the
judge said, and sentenced Conrad to life in prison.
   Western nations ran their own espionage operations in the
Communist East, sometimes with fatal consequences.
   Double agent Horst Galau was arrested by East Germany in 1985
and died three years later in Bautzen prison. East German officials
said he hanged himself, but West German intelligence said it might
have been murder.
   Germany is united now, but spy scandals continue.
   The arrest of Klaus Kuron might have been enough to destroy the
government a few years ago. His surrender Oct. 7, however, seemed
merely to underscore the old assumption that East Germany had
seriously compromised West German intelligence.
   At least 12 other alleged spies were arrested in connection with
the Kuron case and dozens more are on the run. Officials say some
have been taken over by the KGB.
   Intelligence officers expect spying to continue in Germany, but
now that the Soviet bloc has collapsed, there is no more flavor of
a morality play.
   ``One shouldn't see this in a moralistic way,'' a German
official said. ``Fashion designers send their own snoops off to see
what the competition will have in the latest collection. That's not
much different from espionage.''

<TEXT>
   By his own reckoning, Brian
Mashile should have become a blind begger. Instead, he made himself
into a successful lawyer.
   Eleven years ago, Mashile was a poor black teen-ager who had
lost his sight in an assault. His mother was dead and his father
worked far from home.
   No one in his family had completed high school. He lived in one
of the worst slums of a nation that offers little opportunity to
blacks even if they are not handicapped.
   His options were limited, but his determination was not. Today,
at 30, Mashile works for a leading corporate law firm that has two
other black attorneys.
   ``I am motivated every time I think of the alternative, he said.
``The alternative would be to go to the streets and become a
beggar.''
   Mashile succeeded in a country where apartheid laws and crushing
poverty have made black achievers an exception.
   Before he was blinded, he dreamed of being a doctor, but never
told anyone for fear of ridicule.
   In Alexandra, a poor black township next to Johannesburg's
wealthy white suburbs, youthful dreams usually die in the
day-to-day struggle for survival.
   Goats and dogs roam the streets, competing for scraps of rotting
garbage. The pungent smell mixes with eye-watering smoke from coal
fires and the choking dust of the orange dirt streets.
   ``To leave this was almost beyond my comprehension,'' Mashile
said of Alexandra.
   He was the youngest of six children, in a two-room house without
electricity, running water or indoor plumbing. His mother died when
he was 10 and his father worked as a gold miner, hundreds of miles
away.
   At 16, he quit school to work as a delivery man and saved money
to return to Alexandra High School a year later.
   Then, one night in 1979, four men attacked him and a friend on
an Alexandra street. One hit Mashile in the face with a wooden
stick that sent shards of his glasses into his eyes.
   He was blinded in the right eye and the left only distinguishes
light from dark.
   In the hospital, he cried for weeks.
   ``Why me?'' he said. ``You just can't find an answer. After you
cry, you get angry, and finally you decide to become rational and
say, `What am I going to do with my life?'''
   Mashile's depression lifted when he fell in love with a nurse.
   ``It was the first time I felt I could be accepted as a blind
person,'' he said. ``My whole attitude changed.''
   The relationship didn't last, but his motivation did.
   In 1981, when he was 21, Mashile returned to Alexandra High
School, his guidance stick in one hand, a portable typewriter in
the other. He graduated two years later with the highest marks of
70 students.
   He was accepted at Johannesburg's University of the
Witwatersrand, one of South Africa's most respected schools. The
campus is only a few miles from Alexandra, but neither Mashile nor
anyone he knew had set foot on its manicured lawns.
   Mashile painstakingly transcribed classroom lectures into
braille. He had o rely on fellow students to read to him. For
three years as an undergraduate and three more as a law student, he
began classes at 9 a.m. and often would study past midnight.
   ``He never asked for favors,'' said Tony Leon, one of Mashile's
law professors and now a member of Parliament. ``He never missed an
assignment, even though everything took him much longer to do than
it would a sighted person.''
   For any black to become a lawyer is noteworthy. Three-fourths of
South Africa's 40 million people are black, but only about 500 of
the 7,000 lawyers are black.
   After graduation in 1988, Mashile applied to 30 law firms. Only
three interviewed him, and they were skeptical.
   His one job offer came from Edward Nathan and Friedland, a
corporate firm with more than 50 lawyers.
   The young lawyer has ``done everything we expect without any
special assistance,'' said Pierre Ferreira, head of the litigation
department where Mashile works.
   He has applied for a scholarship to study labor law in the
United States and, if accepted into the program, hopes to attend an
Ivy League school, the University of Michigan or the University of
California at Berkeley.
   Mashile has a voice computer and an assistant whose whose salary
is subsidized by the government because of Mashile's handicap.
Beyond that, he functions as any other lawyer.
   He does not tell clients he is black or blind before they meet
him. They arrive on the 23rd floor of one of the city's sleekest
buildings to find a handsome young attorney in a conservative suit
with a thin mustache, a wisp of a beard and sunglasses.
   ``Welcome. You are going to be led by a blind man,'' Mashile
says by way of introduction.
   Last year, another lawyer from the firm always appeared in court
with Mashile. This year, he's on his own.
   ``He's got a gift for appearing in court,'' Ferreira said. ``He
examines witnesses extremely well because he retains everything,
whereas a sighted person would keep referring back to his notes.''
   Mashile assesses his performance more modestly.
   ``I've messed up some,'' he said. ``I've had judges yell at me.
I don't like it, but it makes me know I'm not getting any special
treatment.''
   He still lives in Alexandra, but in a small, modern, four-room
house with a garden, which he shares with two relatives.
   From habit, Mashile rises at 4 a.m. He exercises and is off to
the glass and steel towers of Johannesburg by 7 a.m.
   He jogs often, holding hands with a friend who runs at his side.
Every Friday, he visits his old friends at the university and meets
his girlfriend. He still misses playing soccer.
   ``I have achieved many things I once only dreamed of,'' Mashile
said. ``Maybe blindness was a blessing in disguise.''

   On one point, at least, politicians agree:
voters are fed up with politicians. But the voters may not do much
about it in the congressional elections on Tuesday.
   After all, when it comes time to vote, the choice is between
politicians. Even when the mood is sour, and people are complaining
about Congress, they tend to approve the performance of their own
congressmen. It's other people's incumbents they want fired.
   In 73 of the nation's 100 congressional elections, at least 80
percent of the House incumbents who sought new terms got them,
according to a Library of Congress study. It hit 98 percent in 1986
and 1988.
   Incumbent re-election rates in the House have exceeded 90
percent in every election since 1968 save one - the Watergate year
of 1974.
   The Senate's incumbent re-election rate isn't quite as high, but
it still points to the advantage of being there - 85 percent of
those who sought new terms in 1988 won them.
   House incumbents certainly can't count being as safe as those of
the 1988 elections, when only seven congressmen ran and lost. The
average during the past two decades has far higher - 24.
   But strategists in both parties agree that this year, only about
25, and certainly no more than 30 congressmen are up against
challengers who stand a realistic chance of ousting them.
   The powers of incumbency are one reason. Another is that the
Republicans didn't gain seats in the last election, when they won
the White House again: They actually lost three.
   Off-year elections often have reversed the coattail winners of
the presidential year. There aren't many to reverse this time -
with 259 House seats, Democratic strength is the highest it has
ever been two years into the term of a Republican president.
   Sixty-one incumbents are running unopposed, 18 more have no
major party challenger.
   So, for all the signs of frustration and anger at Congress, it
would take an upheaval of historic proportions for incumbent
bashing to bloom into wholesale incumbent beating.
   But the Republicans' most visible national campaigners certainly
are trying. President Bush says voters can ``vent their
frustration, their anger, and the betrayal they felt'' by ousting
incumbent Democrats.
   ``The American people are fed up to here with incumbents,'' says
Vice President Dan Quayle, taking his argument to unlikely lengths
by claiming it is Democrats who really are in trouble, never mind
Bush's dive in the polls or the discomfort of some Republicans over
administration turnaround on taxes and the worsening economic
situation.
   Bush and Quayle are talking about Democratic incumbents, and
while there are more of them, the tactic does have an ironic side.
Republicans boasted early in the season of a strong lineup of
Senate challengers, with five GOP House members running against
Democratic senators. Now that undercuts their own anti-incumbent
argument - those GOP challengers are part of the same unpopular
Congress. Four of the five are trailing in the pre-election polls.
   The hole in the campaign against incumbency is that while most
people are saying they don't approve of the way Congress is doing
its job, they tend to support their own congressman.
   In an ABC News-Washington Post poll, 63 percent of the people
said they disapproved of Congress, though 64 percent said they
approved of the job their own member is doing.
   Bush's job approval rating, however, was 55 percent, down 20
points in two months.
   While that may affect Republican fortunes now, Gov. Richard F.
Celeste of Ohio, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association,
thinks ``the longer-term fallout is going to be equally on
Democratic members of Congress.''
   ``I think people are fed up,'' he said, and may show it by
staying home, keeping down the turnout in an off year, when it is
likely to be low anyhow. ``That may be the place where we most see
the reaction against incumbents.''
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, anticipates a voter turnout similar to that of
1986, when 36.4 percent of eligible voters actually cast ballots.
That was the lowest since the wartime election of 1942.
   In modern elections, the rate at which congressional incumbents
have returned to office has ranged between 82 and 86 percent.
That's likely to hold, too. Dissatisfaction notwithstanding, the
next Congress probably will look a lot like the one that just
struggled to adjournment.

   The park ranger leads a gaggle of tourists up
to the elaborate cast-iron fence and points to the big violet-gray
house with three styles of Greek columns.
   ``This house was built in 1857. The hexagonal bay was added in
1869. ... Do you know who lives here?''
   Its owner, novelist Anne Rice, gives a different tour: The house
as setting for ``The Witching Hour,'' her new novel about a line of
women seduced by an evil spirit that wants to take flesh.
   The sunny porch is where the witch Dierdre Mayfair sat, drugged
senseless but still entranced by her demonic lover's murmurs. The
swimming pool outside was filled with champagne for Stella
Mayfair's gaudy parties.
   Rice points to a tall door in the hallway.
   ``That's the elevator. I gave Stella the elevator. ... It was,
in fact, put in by a woman by the name of Pamela Starr Clapp, who's
supposed to haunt this house. But I haven't seen her.''
   Rice said Mrs. Clapp lived in the house from 1867 to 1932, and
she's heard that the previous owners saw her apparition in the
dining room. Even though it was said to be a good presence rather
than a malevolent one, Rice would just as soon not see it herself.
   ``I've never talked to the previous owners myself. I guess I
should. But I'm scared of the dark and being alone, and I don't
encourage apparitions,'' she said. ``If they're there, I don't want
to see them. I'm not sure I could survive it mentally.''
   This from a woman made famous by a series of sensuous novels
about vampires, a woman whose next book is ``In the Frankenstein
Tradition.''
   ``The supernatural novel is a wonderful frame for what I want to
do. But I haven't seen ghosts myself,'' she said.
   What she wants to do is write serious books that are both
enjoyable and unforgettable, though she's also written
sadomasochistic pornography under the name A.N. Roquelaure and
erotic contemporary novels as Anne Rampling.
   Why the supernatural?
   ``I really don't know. You might as well ask John Updike why he
writes about New England. You write what works for you.''
   Rice, 49, also has written two non-supernatural novels under her
own name: ``Cry to Heaven'' about the 18th-century opera singers
who underwent castration to keep their beautiful soprano voices,
and ``The Feast of All Saints,'' about the free people of color who
lived in New Orleans in the 1800s.
   The supernatural, she says, allows her to pull together all the
disparate elements of her life.
   ``I like to talk about history, I like to write from a larger
perspective, see our lives as if from the outside. All that works
wonderfully when I'm writing about an immortal - an imagined
character that is immortal.''
   Her mad scientist's creation in ``In the Frankenstein
Tradition'' also provides an outside view. ``It gives me again the
grand perspective on humans - a way to talk about humanity that is
completely fresh,'' she said.
   The advance from ``The Witching Hour'' gave her the money to buy
the house. She had already finished about five chapters, with the
story set in a different kind of house. After moving, she switched
the locale.
   The macabre is an occasional note in her decorations: a small
skull on the mantelpiece above her doll collection, a life-sized
carved wooden skeleton in a burgundy velvet chair facing
12-year-old Chris' mini-trampoline.
   She and her husband, poet Stan Rice, 47, and their son moved
from San Francisco because Rice wanted to return to the city she
left when she was 15 years old.
   ``I was dying to come home. ... I never got New Orleans out of
my blood. I would feel cravings for New Orleans that were
positively physical. I would turn off songs like `Do You Know What
It Means to Miss New Orleans.'''
   They moved into another house in July 1988, then bought the $1.2
million mansion a few blocks away at 1239 First Street, in the
Garden District.
   The house, identified by a plaque on the woven iron fence as
``Rosegate - the Brevard-Clapp House,'' is light and airy, not
brooding or gloomy.
   ``We spent a lot of time bringing light into it,'' said Rice.
``It was a great deal darker before we painted it.''
   The tour continues. This half-tester bed, with the gathered
green velvet panel high above the head, is where both Deirdre and
her ancestor, Mary Beth, died. Antha leaped or was shoved out of
this many-paned floor-to-ceiling window in the front bedroom.
   ``They're very, very real. But the house is real in a totally
different dimension,'' said Rice. ``You know, I don't walk around
this house thinking about the Mayfair witches. It's my house. And
the real history of this house is significant.
   ``Eisenhower has visited this house, President Carter slept
here, and the author Eudora Welty came here once. ... Judge John
Minor Wisdom lived here for a year. He was a great desegregation
hero. ... That's more vital to me, day in and day out.''
   Park ranger Gilbert Campa would agree. The house has been part
of the Garden District tour as long as the National Park Service
has been giving it, he said. ``This fence, they say, is the
prototype for chain-link fence,'' he told the tourists.
   Some characters have another peculiar sort of reality.
   When Rice was a child, her mother told her that when Charles
Dickens was writing ``The Old Curiosity Shop,'' people waited on a
New York pier for the ship carrying the next installment from
England.
   ``People yelled from the shore, `Is Little Nell dead?' The
captain yelled, `Yes,' and people sat down and cried. I want to
make people do that.''
   And in the past couple of years, she said, two women have called
- Rice's telephone number is listed - to ask if her vampires were
real. When she said no, the women burst into tears.
   ``I was deeply, deeply touched. Here was this woman on the phone
crying because Lestat was not real. ... They believed that it
happened. I know I believe it - that's a foregone conclusion. But
to make somebody else believe it - that was a very, very important
moment.''
   At least some of ``The Witching Hour'' characters will return.
Rice said she hadn't planned a sequel at first, but friends who
read the book wanted to learn what happens to protagonist Michael
Curry.
   ``Everything I wanted to put in it was there. But afterward, the
first people I showed it to would ask, `What happens next? You have
to get Michael out of there,' is what they would say. `You can't do
that to Michael.'''

<HEAD>Mercury Danger Rises Across the Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poisonous mercury is spewing unregulated out of the
nation's smokestacks and reaching dangerous levels in soil, plants
and animals.
   Twenty states from Florida to Minnesota to California have
limited or banned consumption of fish from some lakes and streams.
   One of the highest mercury concentrations in the country is
poisoning the once-pristine Everglades, and has been blamed for the
death of at least one endangered Florida panther.
   Scientists and environmental groups are pointing the finger at
two mercury emission sources left unregulated by the Environmental
Protection Agency - coal-fired energy plants and the
fastest-growing threat, trash-burning municipal incinerators.
   ``In the past, we would take our mercury wastes and bury them so
they would contaminate the ground water in just one place,'' said
Gary Glass, an EPA mercury researcher in Duluth, Minn. ``Now we've
gotten smarter - we're blowing it into the air so it can go
everywhere.''
   Washington-based Clean Water Action, using data supplied by
industry and the EPA, reported last month that 187 incinerators
nationwide emit almost 75,000 pounds of mercury each year. Ninety
more incinerators are planned.
   Massachusetts, New York, Florida and Ohio led the list, but all
but four states have incinerators emitting mercury; those four are
planning facilities.
   ``Mercury emissions have doubled in the last decade and will
probably double again if all planned incinerators are brought on
line,'' warned Henry Cole, who helped write Clean Water Action's
study.
   Mercury comes from a variety of sources in trash, including
batteries, paints, dyes, electronics, fluorescent lights, plastics
- and even yard cuttings, which have picked up the contaminant from
previous airborne pollution.
   Municipal garbage-burning plants spread the indestructable
mercury by heating it into a vapor that can travel 200 miles, said
Paul Connett, a chemistry professor at St. Lawrence University in
Canton, N.Y.
   The mercury ultimately settles in soil and water. It accumulates
exceptionally well in moist peat, helping to explain the high
Everglades readings. But a California study found forest canopies
can collect mercury even under drier conditions.
   The poison moves up the food chain, concentrating more at each
level, a process called biomagnification. From soil it travels to
plants, fish, and on to rccoons, otters, eagles and other
predators - including people.
   Concentrations found in fish at one Minnesota lake have
increased 5 percent a year since 1970, according to a Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency study.
   In humans, mercury can damage the brain, liver, kidney and
blood, and is often characterized by tremors and confusion. It also
causes deformations in fetuses. Cole is researching whether mercury
collects in breast milk.
   As Glass observed, incinerators were initially hailed as a
solution to keep mercury and other toxic wastes out of landfills,
where they often leached into groundwater. But only belatedly have
studies shown that the scrubber and filter technology that cleans
smoke of toxic gasses fails to work on mercury.
   Ray Morrison, mercury project officer for the EPA, said a recent
check of California incinerators showed that instead of pollution
control devices collecting 70 percent of the mercury as expected,
``the collection rate is dropping off to zero.''
   Some states have adopted their own mercury emission levels, but
environmentalists say EPA acted too little and too late on airborne
mercury contamination.
   There are no mercury emissions limits for the trash-burning
facilities, although the agency expects to have some in place by
December, EPA spokesman David Ryan said.
   ``Obviously we think mercury is a problem, and we are moving on
it,'' he said. Under EPA pressure, battery makers have drastically
cut the amount of mercury they use, and mercury fungicides are
being removed from paints.
   But Ryan acknowledged there are no plans to limit mercury from
coal-burning energy plants, believed to be the biggest source of
contamination in some parts of the country.
   EPA critics, while welcoming the incinerator standards, complain
that even those proposed standards are based on direct inhalation
of mercury, not accumulation in the environment.
   In the meantime, incinerators face growing opposition.
   Environmental officials in Ontario sued Detroit's municipal
incinerator, the largest in the United States, angered in part
because of excess mercury emissions that forced Michigan to shut
the facility down briefly in April. A trash-burning incinerator in
Stanislaus County, Calif., was found to have excessive mercury
emissions and was told to suspend operations by the state.
   The Georgia environmental group Citizen Action has publicly
blamed mercury contamination in the Turtle and Brunswick rivers on
the state's only operating municipal waste incinerator, nearby in
Savannah.
   Greenpeace in Florida has blasted the giant incinerators ringing
the Everglades on the Gulf and Southeast coast. Scientists around
the world cite the moist, peat-filled Everglades as having the
ideal meteorolgical and biological conditions for concentrating
mercury.
   Europeans have acted faster than Americans. In June, scientists
at an international conference in Sweden declared airborne
contamination the largest source of the problem and said
concentrations worldwide are reaching dangerous levels.
   The Netherlands imposed tough new regulations on incinerators
after finding widespread mercury contamination. Germany, where some
doctors in Bavaria warn mothers not to breastfeed because of
mercury, is also tightening restrictions.
   Clean Water's study concludes that tougher regulations and
better technology are required to deal with mercury contamination
in the United States.
   But environmentalists warn that pollution control is not enough.
Mercury, they note, cannot be destroyed and remains in the
environment forever.
   ``People have to demand recycling,'' said Brian Hunt, southern
regional toxics coordinator for Greenpeace. ``Mercury is a global
pollutant, and there is no pollution control equipment that
captures all of it. We must never, never burn garbage.''

   At 19, Nancy W. became sure she was being
followed - her first symptom of acute schizophrenia that would for
10 years turn reality into a protean monster, holding her hostage
to delusion and paranoia.
   It would drive her to live in a car, emerging late at night to
eat from tin cans in her parents' kitchen. She was in and out of
mental hospitals, and spent six months roaming the East Coast
alone.
   Communication became impossible.
   ``She just did not have that ability at all - to laugh, to
cry,'' said her father, George W., of Hampstead, in a voice as flat
as the emotional terrain he described.
   Nancy never will eliminate the chemical mbalance spawning the
demons in her brain. But with a new anti-psychotic drug, she
coexists with them in guarded neutrality. At 29, she has her own
apartment in Salem and takes courses at a community college.
   The drug clozapine, marketed as Clozaril, has elicited similar
success stories, particularly among severely ill people whom other
medications have failed.
   Unlike other drugs prescribed for schizophrenia, such as
thorazine and prolixin, clozapine doesn't cause involuntary facial
tremors known as tardive dyskinesia - a condition that is sometimes
irreversible.
   Many of those ``cured'' by clozapine are described as having
awakened.
   George W. and his wife, Catherine, saw almost immediate
improvement in Nancy. ``We got our daughter back. She got herself
back,'' he said.
   Clozapine is touted by many experts as the first significant
breakthrough in psychopharmacology in 30 years, and the harbinger
of a new wave of anti-psychotics. But its cost - $9,000 a year per
patient - has some in the mental health community up in arms.
   Nationally, the Food and Drug Administration estimates 200,000
severe schizophrenics could benefit from the drug. But because of
the cost, only about 7,000 people are taking it.
   Pennsylvania will spend $2 million this fiscal year to treat
schizophrenics with clozapine in state hospitals, enough for about
220 patients. Officials say there are 4,500 schizophrenics among
the 7,000 patients in Pennsylvania's state hospitals.
   A coalition of mental health groups in Pennsylvania has sued
seeking to require the state to buy clozapine for all eligible
patients in its hospital system. A group of patients in New York
also has sued trying to force that state to offer Medicaid
reimbursement for clozapine.
   In Kansas, a federal judge's ruling requires Medicaid to pay for
the drug.
   Last month, New Hampshire approved spending $135,000 for the
drug, enough to treat only a few of an estimated 250 people who
could benefit from it, said Mental Health Director Donald Shumway.
   Shumway, along with counterparts in other states, is trying to
negotiate a lower price with clozapine's sole U.S. manufacturer,
Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J.
   Much of the cost is for monitoring patients for agranulocytosis,
a potentially fatal side effect that reduces the level of
infection-fighting white blood cells. Studies have shown the
condition can be reversed if caught early.
   Under the monitoring system, a home health care company
distributes the medication each week and collects blood samples for
analysis.
   Administrators say the monitoring could be done much more
cheaply by state hospitals.
   Shumway tried to cut costs by taking over the monitoring from
Sandoz.
   ``They're willing to let us do the work, they're just not
willing to reduce the price once we do the work,'' he said.
   Six states, led by Minnesota, have threatened antitrust
lawsuits, and legislation has been introduced in Congress to make
the drug more affordable, Shumway said.
   The company won't budge.
   ``All the states are talking to us. We have a fixed price for a
fixed set of services and I don't think that price is going to
change much,'' said Sandoz spokesman David Winter.
   The root of the problem is ``that the states don't wan't to put
money into take care of the mentally ill,'' he said.
   Agranulocytosis occurs in 1 percent to 2 percent of patients
taking clozapine.
   Shumway said many medications have similar risks, and
manufacturers are never the only ones liable if something goes
wrong. He said the drug is available at a fraction of the cost in
Europe, where governments do the monitoring.
   ``Remember you have national (health) systems in Europe,'' said
Winter. ``There are obvious differences in the systems: differences
in the approach toward liability and medical issues.''
   Sandoz, citing competitive reasons, hasn't broken down its
clozapine costs in the United States. While financially strapped
state governments scoff at what they consider the company's
liability paranoia and accuse it of reaping tremendous profits,
some doctors sympathize with Sandoz.
   ``The litigation issue is an enormous issue,'' said John
Docherty, medical director at Brookside Hospital in Nashua, N.H.
``It's a big problem in this country if you take a look at the
number of lawsuits here vs. in Europe or in Japan.''
   Brookside helped test the drug before Sandoz began marketing it
in February.
   Schizophrenia, considered the most disabling and serious of all
mental illnesses, afflicts 1 percent of the U.S. population.
Symptoms generally appear in early adulthood and include high
anxiety, confusion, language and reasoning problems, hallucinations
and withdrawal.
   ``A lot of times, it's a problem with how clear you think or how
able you are to connect your thoughts,'' Nancy said in deliberate,
measured phrases.
   For her and others, clozapine is a protective shield.
   ``It's a very good drug for keeping away thoughts that should
not be there,'' she said. ``It helps keep what is happening in real
life apart from that which is not there.''

<HEAD>Diseases Ravage Trees of World's Biggest Cork Producer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMMA GILBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forestry experts are asking cork oak
plantation owners and bark strippers to come up with measures to
stop the rot in the evergreen trees that produce more than half the
world's cork.
   Pests and disease have spread because of years of tree neglect,
attempts to increase production on shallow soil and careless and
excessive bark stripping. An estimated 20 percent of Portugal's
cork oak forests have been decimated and infection could reach
epidemic level, experts say.
   Spain, responsible for an additional 25 percent of world
production, is also threatened.
   Farmers from the worst-hit region south of Lisbon commissioned a
four-year study by Lisbon's Agricultural Institute to pinpoint the
causes and help save trees.
   ``By the time the causes of tree deaths have been analyzed, the
trees might all be dead,'' said Joao Bentes, assistant director of
Portugal's Forestry Commission.
   Raul Sardinha of Lisbon's Agronomy Institute said the problems
date to agrarian reforms introduced after the leftist army
revolution in 1974, when plantations run by absentee landlords in
central and southern Portugal were turned into cooperatives.
   State subsidies promoted growing cereal cash crops among the
oaks, which only turn a profit long-term. Modern machinery that
replaced the traditional mule-drawn plough damaged the roots of the
trees.
   Government statistics show a 14 percent drop in cork production
from 1969-77 to 1978-86, the two nine-year stripping cycles.
   Some experts say the figure is low. Only three-quarters of the 4
million acres of cork forest in Portugal is in full production.
   Cork prices have rocketed. Edmundo Pereira, president of the
Cork Industrialists and Exporters Association, said top-quality
cork sold at 20 cents a kilogram (2.2 pounds) in 1982, while last
year, medium-quality cork fetched nearly $2 a kilogram.
   Now, although some of the land is back in the hands of its
former owners, and government and European Economic Community aid
is available to cork farmers, there's no rush to plant new oaks.
   ``The man who starts a cork plantation today must have his
grandchildren in mind,'' said Ewan Rankin, who runs his family's
forest northeast of Lisbon.
   It takes 25 to 30 years before an acorn grows into a tree that
will produce its first harvest, he said.
   Apparently worried about spreading disease, the government last
year hired 300 new rangers to enforce forestry regulations,
particularly regarding cork stripping - a craft traditionally
passed from father to son.
   But Ranki and others say that is not enough. ``There should be
more research into genetic growing in nurseries, because now it's
only after 30 years that you know whether a tree is of good or bad
quality,'' he said.
   The Portuguese wine trade is probably the hardest-hit by the
cork crisis. Cork stopper quality has fallen as prices have risen.
Wine-producing countries like France and the United States are
threatening to switch to plastic stoppers.
   ``I cannot imagine drinking a good wine with a plastic stopper
in the bottle. It has to do with the dignity with which good wine
has to be served,'' said Jose Cyrillo Machado of Abrigada, a
vineyard north of Lisbon.
   Cork has been used to stop wine bottles since the 5th century
B.C.

<TEXT>
   Nutritionists say many Americans don't buy
enough of the food that's good for them, so Iowa State hopes to
change what consumers want.
   ``We demand fuel efficient cars that protect us in a crash;
there's no reason you shouldn't demand the same for food,'' said
university researcher Murry Kaplan.
   When Americans get hungry, they reach for fat and sugar, Kaplan
said. ``We know what's good for people, but they won't listen.
Dietary advice has been a failure.''
   Iowa State soon will take bids for a $6.5 million Center for
Designing Foods to Improve Nutrition, where researchers will
investigate what drives people to buy thed how to
make nutritional products more tasty.
   ``The center will be the only one of its kind in the countr food they
do any to
tie together the two ends of the food chain - food production and
human consumption,'' said Beverly Crabtree, dean of the
university's College of Family and Consumer Science.
   ``Researchers will start with what consumers want or need,
whether it be low-fat meats or better-tasting soy products, and
alter food production techniques to develop the new foods,'' she
said.
   Kaplan, acting coordinator of the center, said the country seems
to be ignoring all the hehour from The Associated Press.

<HEAD>Harvard Uses Hypermedia To Study Turnpike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS TORCHIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the tap of a computer key, Boston's suburbs
flit by on the screen and you're out on the Massachusetts Turnpike,
traveling at 12,000 miles an hour.
   ``We'll be in New York in about 40 seconds,'' said Stephen
Ervin, assistant professor of landscape architecture at Harvard
University.
   Last year, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority asked Harvard's
Graduate School of Design to develop a framework for the turnpike's
safety, structure and appearance.
   Harvard dreamed up what is called hypermedia - ``pictures and
graphs and text all tied together in a database,'' Ervin said.
   Carl Steinitz, professor of landscape architecture, spent four
days with a film crew, taking photos of the entire 135-mile highway
from Boston west to the New York border.
   Steinitz and Ervin compiled the photos on computer and linked
the location of each image to map data. The database also includes
information on local zoning laws and population densities.
   ``We have a connection between visual information - what does it
look like - and a map form - where is it, what are some of the
attributes about it,'' Ervin said.
   For example, the hypermedia system can confirm visually that a
certain stretch of road has room for a truckstop. It also can check
to see if the noisy truck stop would be too close to neighborhoods.
   Steinitz and Ervin gave their creation to graduate students as a
project.
   Using image processing, the students painted in pylons or banks
of flowers on images of the road on the computer screen. They also
explored putting rest stops close to nature trails or near
Springfield to promote the city's mill town heritage.
   ``It means that you can be very creative ahead of time as you
make plans for the turnpike,'' said Ann Hershfang, vice chairwoman
of the turnpike authority.
   Turnpike engineers want to start using the hypermedia program
within the next few years, Hershfang said. ``It can help us with
accidents, it can help us with snow clearing, it can help us with
safety in a lot of ways.''
   Major computer companies are working on hypermedia systems,
which require little new technology but could have a broad impact
on highway engineering, Steinitz said.
   The system could even help police determine why accidents occur
in certain places.
   ``Do these all happen on a downhill slope in Christmas when its
icy?'' Ervin said. ``Well, we have all the data now to be able to
check some of that stuff out.''

<HEAD>Filmmakers Say Octopuses Have Gentle Tentacles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For filmmaker Victoria Stone, the brush of
a gentle tentacle across her lips was ``quite nice.''
   The encounter occurred when Stone and her partner Mark Deeble,
who are making a documentary on giant octopuses for the British
Broadcasting Corp., were diving in Puget Sound.
   One of their eight-armed subjects stretched a tentacle and
softly touched Stone's lips - the only part of her body not covered
by wetsuit.
   ``It was quite nice,'' she said. ``I could feel one sucker come
down, and then the next, and then the next.''
   The tender meeting was no surprise to the filmmakers, who know
the octopus as a good-natured, intelligent creature that has been
miscast as a horror film man-hungry villain.
   The team also found that octopuses quickly learn to recognize
people and react to their presence by swimming excitedly.
   ``These are not non-feeling, gooey entities,'' said Brian
Baldissin, the zoo's marine education specialist who has taught
Pacific octopuses how to open a plastic container to get at
crabmeat inside. He and the filmmakers found the animals are adept
at negotiating mazes and opening a series of doors that swing in
different directions.
   ``It's very dramatic what they're capable of,'' Deeble said.
``Just from what we've seen, I believe octopuses are on a par with
dogs and cats in terms of intelligence.''
   The film is scheduled for January in the ``National Geographic
Explorer'' series on British and American public television.

<HEAD>Acute Shortage of X-Ray Technologists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospital workers who operate X-ray equipment and
related high-tech machinery say staffing shortages are worsening in
their field, partly because people seeking careers are unaware of
the opportunities.
   ``A lot of people - when they think about careers in health care
- think `doctors and nurses,''' said Arlene Adler, a radiology
educator who met over the weekend with other members of a coalition
called the Summit on Manpower.
   The Summit, which comprises 18 groups including the American
College of Radiology and the American Hospital Association, says 3
percent to 15 percent of hospital positions for X-ray technologists
are going unfilled.
   For nuclear medicine technologists, who use radioactive drugs to
take pictures of the body, vacancy rates also range from 3 percent
to 15 percent.
   For radiation therapy technologists, the rates are higher, 5
percent to 21 percent. And for sonographers, rates are 4 percent to
17 percent.
   Government studies indicate that radiological and related
technology jobs will be among the top 10 in demand by 2000, said
Ms. Adler, director of the Radiologic Technology Program at Indiana
University Northwest in Gary.
   Radiology and sonography positions usually require two years of
course work after high school.
   Chris Hornback, an X-ray technologist in Chicago Heights, said
starting annual pay is $24,000 to $26,000, and after five years can
range from $33,000 to $35,000. About 600 programs exist for
radiological technology training, and 100 programs exist for each
of the other fields, Ms. Adler said.
   ---
   Editor's Note: Information about educational programs for
radiation technology and related fields is available through the
Summit's hot line from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST, 1-800-432-3247.

   General Motors Corp. said it lost $2 billion in
the third quarter, the biggest quarterly loss in automotive
history, largely due to the enormous costs of retooling or closing
inefficient factories.
   Without the $2.1 billion in restructuring charges, the world's

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A $909.5 million patent infringement
judgment against Eastman Kodak Co. resulted in a $206 million third

   Kodak said Wednesday its earnings would have increased 19
percent for the quarter without the judgment. Kodak was ordered by
a U.S. District Court judge in Boston earlier this month to pay
Polaroid $909.5 million in a 14-year-old patent infringement suit
over Kodak's sales of instant cameras and film.

   The price of oil could easily ``explode'' to $100 per barrel if
war broke out in the Persian Gulf, a panel of experts told a Senate
committee.
   Wednesday's comments came as the International Energy Agency
reported that threats of oil shortages due to the Persian Gulf
crisis are easing as OPEC countries boost output and industrial
nations cut demand.
   However, higher oil prices are shaking the confidence of
consumers and businesses in many regions of the country, the
Federal Reserve Board said in a generally bleak assessment of the
nation's economy. Oil prices rallied late Wednesday to move above
$35 per barrel in a third straight erratic trading session that
largely ignored news on the Persian Gulf standoff.

   In reaction to Wednesday's news, Reuters shares dropped 83.6
cents to $10.69 on the London Stock Exchange, a low for the year.
Reuters said the jobs to be cut will be in the central corporate
departments covering finance, marketing and administration. A small
number of editorial jobs also could be affected.

   Florida's worst outbreak of mosquito-borne
encephalitis in 13 years has the tourism industry dismissing the
chances of people catching the virus but still worried that
visitors might change their travel plans.
   The outbreak of the disease has thrown a scare into the $26
billion a year industry already feeling sluggish from declines in
the national economy and rising gasoline prices.
   But while some local tourist officials feared a disaster, there
have been few reports of trip cancellations.
   ``The majority of calls are from people saying `How bad is this,
really?''' said Jennifer Clark, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach
County Convention and Visitors Bureau. But Jack Smith, executive
director of the Key West Hotel and Motel Association, said he's
seen several groups cancel trips in recent weeks.
   So far this year, 76 cases of St. Louis encephalitis and three
deaths have been confirmed in 23 counties stretching from Tampa to
Miami. Orange County, with tourist-rich Orlando as the county seat,
accounts for the greatest number of cases with 14.
   Flu-like symptoms are most common, but the young and old are
susceptible to complications.
   The traditional ``snowbird'' winter tourist season falls beyond
the reach of mosquito season, state health agency spokesman David
Adams said Wednesday. ``We've never had a confirmed case after the
first week in December.''
   He said cases being reported now actually were contracted in
September, but tests take four to six weeks to confirm the virus.
   Realizing the potential for lost business in a state that
welcomes 40 million visitors each year, Florida tourism and health
officials combined on a damage-control campaign.
   State Commerce Secretary Bill Sutton advises in a recorded
telephone message that the disease has affected only 5 people in a
million and that resorts have bolstered their pesticide spraying to
kill the disease-carrying mosquitoes.
   His department has issued an encephalitis fact sheet and travel
tips to keep tourists coming while advising them to take simple
precautions. They include using insect repellent and wearing
long-sleeved shirts and pants at night, when the mosquitoes come
out to feed.
   Walt Disney World, the biggest attraction, suspended a campfire
sing-along and an evening water pageant and moved a lakeside luau
to a hotel, but otherwise is operating normally, said spokesman
John Dreyer.
   ``We do make our resort guests aware of it with a little flier
in their room,'' he said. ``But there's really no reason people
can't come and enjoy the same vacation they could as any other
time.''
   Some tourism officials say the medical threat has been overblown
and that state officials share some of the blame, but others say
the state is doing its best to ward off an unwarranted panic.
   Ronald Rose, Chamber of Commerce executive director in Jensen
Beach, which bills itself as the sea turtle capital of the world,
wrote Sutton and Gov. Bob Martinez to show his displeasure with
state efforts.
   ``We may have a disaster in the making for the Florida tourism
industry, small retailers and fairs and festivals across the
state,'' Rose wrote earlier this month. A suggestion that people
stay indoors at night ``has panicked people into shutting
themselves up in their houses at night.''
   John Rutherford of the Orlando-Orange County Convention and
Visitors Bureau already is tired of the media attention and
offended by coverage by some British tabloids. He recalled a
headline that said ``Brain-Bug Terror Strikes Brits in Florida.''
   Out of 4,500 delegates to an American Bankers Association
convention in Orlando this month, Rutherford noted only three
canceled their plans because of the encephalitis scare.
   Word of the outbreak has spread, but travel agencies say they
are seeing little effect.
   ``Out of all of my clients I have had one, believe it or not,
who was concerned,'' said Tina Vespoli, manager of Creative Travel
in West Islip, N.Y. About 60 percent of the agency's airline
tickets are sold for Florida destinations.

   In taking a top post at Random House, Harold
Evans becomes publisher of the memoirs of Rupert Murdoch, the media
baron Evans clashed with before quitting as editor of The Times of
London in the early 1980s.
   But Evans indicated Wednesday in the wake of his appointment a
day earlier to one of the most prestigious posts in American book
publishing that he harbors no ill will toward his old boss.
   ``Now that I'm your publisher, you can be sure that your book
will be published under me at Random House with maximum panache,''
Evans said he wrote in a letter to Murdoch. ``And by the way, don't
pull any punches.''
   Evans became editor at The Times, a British daily newspaper, in
early 1981 after 14 years as editor of The Sunday Times of London.
   But he resigned in March 1982 after repeated disagreements with
Murdoch over the political independence of the newspaper.
   Murdoch is chief executive at News Corp. Ltd., which owns both
newspapers as part of a media emprire that includes a movie studio,
the Fox Television network, TV stations, newspapers and magazines
in the U.S.
   Random House obtained the rights to publish Murdoch's memoirs
only recently, and Evans was named Tuesday as president and
publisher of the division of Random House that will publish the
book.
   A spokesman for Murdoch did not return phone calls Wednesday for
reaction to Evans' appointment and letter.
   In a telephone interview, Evans said he plans to promote
Murdoch's book ``in a very big way.''
   He described his departure from the Times as ``one little
incident.''
   ``We both moved beyond those arguments of 10 years ago,'' he
said.
   Random House publishes about 120 books a year including works by
authors such as James Michener, Norman Mailer, William Styron and
Robert Ludlum.
   It is the nation's biggest publisher of general trade books,
which include fiction and non-fiction for adult readers as well as
books for children.
   The book industry newsletter BP Report of Wilton, Conn.,
estimates that Random House had $850 million in sales of general
trade books in 1989, well ahead of second-place Bantam Doubleday
Dell at $595 million.
   The company declined to comment on sales. It is owned by the
privately held Advance Publications Inc., controlled by the
Newhouse family.
   Evans, 62, was named president and publisher of the adult
general books division of Random House with responsibility for that
imprint as well as those of Villard Books and Times Books.
   He replaces Joni Evans, 48, who had been publisher of the Random
House adult division since 1987 and will now found a new imprint
for the publishing company. Harold Evans and Joni Evans are not
related.
   Evans said he was approached about taking the new job in the
past week or two after Joni Evans persisted with her longstanding
desire to start her own book imprint.
   Harold Evans will become executive vice president of Random
House, a post which Ms. Evans retains as well.
   Harold Evans comes to the new job from another Newhouse company,
Conde Nast Publications, where he was founding editor in chief of
Conde Nast Traveler magazine. That publication has won plaudits
from media critics for occasionally publishing stories critical of
potential advertisers.
   After leaving The Times of London in 1982, Evans was editor in
chief at The Atlantic Monthly Press and editorial directoe of U.S.
News &amp; World Report from 1984-86. He helped found Conde Nast
Traveler in 1986.
   He is married to Tina Brown, editor of Conde Nast's Vanity Fair
magazine.

<HEAD>Berlin Beckons Travelers with New Direct World Flights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a rocky start, Berlin is back as a world
destination for air travelers after a 45-year interruption.
   Until airlines changed to a new winter timetable last Sunday,
rights to fly the Berlin route were closely restricted to the
airlines of the victorious World War II Allies.
   You could fly to Berlin from London, Paris, Moscow and a few
other European cities outside Germany. Pan Am had four New York
flights a week. Otherwise, Berlin was an international air-traffic
deadend, though for isolated West Berlin its air routes were a
treasured bridge across Communist East Germany.
   The German flag carrier, Lufthansa, was founded in Berlin in
1926 but could not fly to the city, frozen out by the special
rights given to the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet
Union as occupying powers of the divided city.
   A typical long-haul journey to Berlin would mean changing planes
in Frankfurt, often to Pan Am, which had the lion's share of
Frankfurt-Berlin traffic.
   No more. The Allies' special privileges ended on Oct. 3 when the
two Germanys united. Lufthansa paid Pan Am $150 million for its
domestic German operations, and last Sunday Lufthansa made its
first Berlin flight in 45 years.
   The German airline has plastered the city with ads saying
``We're home again,'' and now offers nonstop flights from Berlin to
Tokyo, Moscow and Newark, N.J., serving New York.
   Airlines from other countries, including Iberia, Alitalia,
Singapore Airlines, Swissair and El Al are shouldering into the
Berlin market.
   But last Sunday, a surprise job action disrupted the gala
welcomes laid on for a raft of new international flights. Thirteen
Pan Am pilots who were supposed to be flying Lufthansa flights
called in sick.
   Lufthansa spokesman Peter Hoebel said four flights had to be
canceled and 40 were delayed as the airlines struggled to deal with
the unexpected difficulty.
   Tegel airport was chaotic. Some passengers waited hours for
baggage, several flights had to share the same departure lounge,
and access roads were jammed with double-parked cars left by people
waiting for delayed passengers.
   ``We sent a message to New York, asking Pan Am to work on the
problem,'' Hoebel said, ``and the next day the pilots were suddenly
well again.''
   Hoebel said the pilots were all Americans who have settled in
Germany and want to be taken over into Lufthansa as Pan Am cabin
crew workers were. But they were not part of the takeover deal and
Pan Am must eventually find other jobs for them, the Lufthansa
spokesman said.
   For the time being, the pilots are flying old Boeing 727s in Pan
Am colors under Lufthansa flight numbers, but Lufthansa plans to
stop using the 727s next year.
   Despite the startup confusion, Lufthansa sees a great future for
Berlin as an air-travel hub and expects it to grow to equal
Frankfurt, Germany's busiest, Hoebel said.
   But the city suffers a lack of capacity even with three airports
currently in operation, and there are only vague plans to build a
new airport south of the city. Environmental issues are expected to
complicate the choice of a site for a major airfield.
   Meanwhile, the former western sector of Berlin has Tegel airport
as the main international flight center and Tempelhof for
short-haul flights. In former East Berlin, Schoenefeld airport is
in operation for long-haul flights.
   The Soviet airline Aeroflot, formerly restricted to Schoenefeld
in the east, has started daily flights to Moscow from Tegel in the
west. Lufthansa has gone the other direction, basing some of its
flights in Schoenefeld.

<HEAD>GM Loses $2 Billion in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s $2-billion third-quarter
loss, which includes a huge expense to permanently close four
plants and stop production at others, was viewed on Wall Street as
a positive move for the company.
   ``This shows a serious commitment on GM's part to improved
domestic financial performance,'' auto analyst Doug Laughlin of
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. said Wednesday after GM announced the results.
   The loss, the biggest in automotive history, stemmed from a
one-time, $2.1-billion charge the automaker took for the closings
of four assembly plants and the idlings and consolidations of other
factories during the next three years.
   During bargaining with the United Auto Workers late this summer,
the company agreed to guarantee the income of workers laid off from
plants shut down because of sales slumps. The labor costs are part
of the $2.1 billion charge.
   GM is formalizing the closing of four plants, one each in
Pontiac, Mich.; Kansas City, Mo.; Atlanta, Ga.; and Framingham,
Mass. The four had been indefinitely closed during the past three
years.
   GM common stock closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange
at $36.75 a share, up 12{ cents. That showed that analysts and
brokers, who anticipated some kind of charge during the quarter,
weren't especially worried about it.
   ``Most charges like this cause the stock to drop sharply,'' said
auto analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
``It's seen as a positive.''
   Without the charge, GM earned $109 million. Revenues for the
quarter rose to $30.8 billion compared with $28.8 billion during
the same time last year.
   GM's profits were far less than expected by analysts last week.
In the third quarter of last year, GM earned $516.9 million. On a
per-share basis, GM lost $3.54 during the quarter this year,
including the charge, compared with a 72 cents-a-share profit last
year.
   Dismal third-quarter results for each of the Big Three -
including a lower-than-expected profit for Ford Motors Co. and a
$214 million loss for Chrysler Corp. - depict a sputtering auto
industry.
   In all, without discretionary charges by GM and accounting
changes by Ford, the Big Three reported a combined loss of $21.2
million during the July-September period.
   ``There is no question that the quarter is dismal,'' Merlis
said. ``This certainly reflects the further automotive downturn
induced by the (Persian) Gulf crisis.
   ``The sad irony is that the autos have outperformed many service
companies and banks in the third quarter.''
   For the first nine months of this year, excluding the charge, GM
earned $1.7 billion, down 51.4 percent from the $3.5 billion it
earned during the same period last year. Including the charge, GM
lost $368.7 million.
   Revenues for the January-September period fell to $94.8 billion
from $95.6 billion.
   Ford on Tuesday reported a $101.7 million profit for the third
quarter, but that was inflated by $86.9 million in accounting
changes. Ford's profits were cut by $69 million when it bolstered
its loan reserves at its First Nationwide Bank subsidiary.
   Taking into account all accounting changes and the loan reserve
shift, Ford's profits were $83.8 million during the quarter.
   Aside from formalizing the closure of four plants, GM also has
announced that it will stop production at truck plants in
Scarborough, Ontario; Lordstown, Ohio; and Pontiac, Mich., along
with closing or consolidating operations of some component plants.
It wasn't clear precisely how many employees would be affected by
the actions.
   ``I would say the restructuring is being seen as a positive on
Wall Street,'' Merlis said. ``GM wants to begin the decade of the
'90s with a clean slate and face the reality of the marketplace.''
   A GM official, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity,
noted that Chairman Robert Stempel immediately ushered in a new
management plan when he took over from Roger Smith on Aug. 1.
   ``You are at the start of a new management team and new
leadership under Bob Stempel,'' the official said. ``And one could
say that better early than late.
   ``Why dribble it out?''

   A religious group pressing companies to drop
advertising from racy television shows has ended a boycott of
Burger King, which will run newspaper ads this weekend touting
support for family values in television.
   The activists, Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, had
singled out the fast-food chain earlier this year because the
religious group said it found the company's commercials often
appeared in TV shows that featured sex, profanity and
anti-Christian stereotyping.
   The group said Wednesday it reached a mutual understanding with
company officials. It called off the proposed yearlong boycott that
began Sept. 1.
   ``It must be stressed that Burger King Corp. did not change its
principles of its media buying policies as a result of the
boycott,'' said Cori Zywotow, a spokeswoman for Burger King.
   ``We are convinced that Burger King shares our concern about the
quality of television programs and will put that concern into
practice in the future,'' said Billy Melvin, chairman of the
religious group that calls itself Clear-TV.
   Ms. Zywotow said the company explained its ``past and present
advertising buying policies'' to the group over the past few weeks
and said the boycott was called off as a result of those
discussions.
   At the same time, she said the company feared its customers may
have been misled about the incidents, and Burger King would run
half-page ads in newspapers across the country to clarify its
position.
   The half-page ads, which carry the headline ``An open letter to
the American people,'' will appear in newspapers this weekend and
early next week, Ms. Zywotow said.
   ``Burger King wishes to go on record as supporting traditional
American values on television, especially the importance of the
family,'' the ads say.
   ``We believe the American people desire television programs that
reflect the values they are trying to instill in their children. We
pledge to support such programs with our advertising dollars,'' the
ads say.
   Ms. Zywotow declined to say how much Burger King was spending to
run the ads and said she did not know precisely how many newspapers
would get them.
   Clear-TV is based in Tupelo, Miss., and says it includes
approximately 1,600 Christian leaders who have a constituency of
about 60 million people.
   While it was not clear what shows Burger King sponsored to draw
the group's wrath, Clear-TV has previously objected to episodes of
such shows as ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``L.A. Law'' and ``Married
... with Children.''
   Donald Wildmon, executive director of the American Family
Association, a group that is part of the Clear-TV coalition, said
leaders of the group had encouraged people to boycott Burger King
through church bulletins, newsletters and the like and would now
encourage people to patronize the stores.
   Ms. Zywotow said the boycott had no impact on systemwide sales
for the chain, which has 5,400 outlets nationwide.
   Wildmon declined to speculate on whether the boycott hurt sales
at Burger King, but added, ``Many companies respond only when sales
are affected.''

<HEAD>FDIC Rejects Purchase Offer of Bank Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has rejected
an offer by managers of Continental Bank and a group of independent
investors to acquire the agency's share of the bank's stock.
   The FDIC on Tuesday rejected an offer of $7.87 per share made by
the management of Continental, bank spokesman Ted McDougal said
Wednesday. The agency also turned down a similar offer by several
independent investors.
   Tuesday's offer was based on Monday's closing price of
Continental stock. It placed the value of 14.2 million shares - 26
percent of banking firm's outstanding stock - controlled by the
FDIC at $111.5 million.
   ``The FDIC board concluded the offer was not in the FDIC's best
interest at this time,'' said spokesman Alan Whitney.
   Before making their latest bid, Continental executives were led
to believe the FDIC would accept a bid at the market price of
Continental stock, said bank vice chairman Richard Huber.
   ``So we got a group together and made a bid at the market,'' he
said. ``We're obviously disappointed. We seem to be ill-fated,
don't we?''
   McDougal refused to identify the independent investors who made
an offer for the shares held by the FDIC. But he said some of them
also made an offer in June to buy the stock. That group, which
included the Tisch family of New York and former Treasury Secretary
William Simon, made an offer of $15.50 a share that was rejected by
the FDIC.
   The Tisch family in October increased its ownership of
Continental Bank Corp. to 8.5 percent. The family, including
Laurence A. Tisch, chief executive of CBS Inc. and chairman of
Loews Corp., says it is buying stocks of a number of banks for
investment purposes in the belief bank stocks are undervalued.
   In 1989, the FDIC canceled a planned public sale of the stock
when it was trading at $22 a share.
   Continental officials said they were confused by the rejection
of offers by the FDIC.
   ``I'm at a loss to explain why they have rejected the third
market-based offer in a year, nor can I guess what they're waiting
for,'' said bank chairman Thomas C. Theobald. ``We have done
everything possible to make it easy for them to sell.''
   The FDIC obtained its stake in Continental Bank when the agency
saved the institution from collapse in June 1984, halting a run on
deposits prompted by concerns about the stability of the bank, at
the time one of the world's largest.
   The agency has not indicated whether it would seek a private
placement of the stock or a general public offering.

   Zapata Corp. has completed the sale of its
offshore drilling rig fleet and related assets to Arethusa
(Offshore) Limited for $298 million, officials said.
   Zapata chairman and chief executive R.C. Lassiter said Wednesday
that under the terms of the previously announced sale Zapata has
purchased an 8.75 percent share of Arethusa, a new Bermuda company,
and will continue to manage 12 rigs.
   Lassiter said selling the rig fleets moves the Houston-based
company toward completing its comprehensive debt restructuring
plan.
   The three-part program that calls for the sale of its offshore
rig fleet to help reduce the company's debt to a manageable level.
   Zapata's $560 million in bank debt is to be reduced to $115
million with the banks receiving $160 million in cash and 94.5
million common shares to increase their ownership to approximately
80 percent of the company.
   Cash offers for Zapata's debentures make up the third part of
the company's plan.
   In addition to oil and natural gas production, Zapata's fishing
operations produce fish meal and edible oil. The company is also
the largest shareholder in Zapata Gulf Marine Corp., the world's
largest operator of marine service vessels.

   The average Japanese worker received a summer bonus
of $3,859 this year, up 7.1 percent from a year earlier and the
biggest year-to-year-increase in 13 years, the Labor Ministry said
Thursday.
   Yoshiaki Kashiwagi of the ministry attributed the increase to
Japan's economic boom. It was the biggest increase since 8.0
percent in 1977, he said.
   Japanese companies pay bonuses twice a year. Summer bonuses at
companies employing 30 or more workers in 1989 averaged $3,663, up
6.9 percent from 1988, and winter bonuses averaged $4,331, up 6.5
percent, Kashiwagi said.
   He said summer bonuses at construction companies rose by a
record 14.0 percent this year to $4,011.
   The average monthly wage at Japanese companies employing more
than 30 workers was $2,034 in 1989, up 3.7 percent from a year
earlier, he said.

   Wheat futures prices opened lower this morning on
the Chicago Board of Trade, extending a monthlong slide. Corn and
soybean futures were narrowly mixed.
   The slight decline in wheat prices reflected continued slack
export demand for U.S. wheat and beneficial weather for the newly
planted winter wheat crop in the Great Plains, analysts said.
   Wheat also was pressured this morning by rumors of a large sale
of Canadian wheat to the Soviet Union. There was speculation
earlier this week that the Soviets were shopping for U.S. grain.
   Corn and soybean prices were little changed in early trading.
Any rally attempts continued to be limited by selling linked to the
corn and soybean harvest, which is nearing completion.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 2 cents lower

   Ralston Purina Co. reported Thursday its profit
for its fourth quarter soared 81.4 percent compared to the same
period last year mainly because of lower advertising and
administrative costs.
   The consumer products company earned $82.0 million, or $1.37 a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $45.2
million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales edged up 1.7 percent to $1.79 billion in the quarter from
$1.76 billion in 1989.
   The company reduced its advertising costs for pet foods and
cereal by 15 percent in the quarter and also reduced its overall
general administrative costs by 5 percent from last year when costs
were high because of the introduction of several new products.
   The cost reductions boosted profits despite lackluster sales,
the company said.
   Ralston Purina is a leading maker of pet food and cereal. The
company also makes Eveready and Energizer batteries and owns
Continental Baking Co., which makes such products as Wonder bread
and Hostess Twinkies.
   For the year, Ralston Purina reported a profit of $396.3
million, or $6.46 a share, down 6.2 percent from $422.5 million, or
$6.44 a share, for last year which included a $71.3 million
one-time gain from the sale of the company's seafood subsidiary.
   Sales for the year rose 7.6 pecent to $7.1 billion from $6.6

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending fell 2.8 percent in
September, its steepest drop since the last recession, the
government said Thursday, and analysts said any recovery is at
least months away.
   ``Given what we see now ... we have several more months to go
before we can say we've hit the bottom,'' said Daryl Delano, an
economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$428.7 billion - the lowest dollar level since $423.1 billion was
spent in November 1988.
   Declines in all categories led to the sharpest tumble since a
3.0 percent drop in January 1982 during the 1981-82 recession.
September spending was 1.1 percent below the $433.4 billion posted
in the same month of 1989.
   ``The weakness across the board probably reflects the overall
decline in business confidence to go along with the well-documented
decline in consumer confidence,'' Delano said.
   The Conference Board, a New York research group, reported last
Friday that consumer confidence in the economy plunged in October
to the lowest level since the last recession. It said its index
tumbled more than 24 points, the biggest one-month drop in the
20-year history of the survey.
   The construction industry also has been wracked for months by
high interest rates, tight lending requirements and, in some areas,
lofty vacancy rates. It has not posted an increase since it rose
0.4 percent last March.
   The Labor Department has reported the loss of more than 100,000
construction jobs in the last four months alone. This included
20,000 jobs in September, after seasonal adjustment.
   Residential spending fell 2.3 percent to an annual rate of
$182.2 billion after a 1.1 percent decline in August.
   ``Residential spending has been down so long, we're still
searching for the bottom,'' Delano said, noting weak building
permit applications and new home sales, both barometers of future
building plans.
   Single-family spending was down 2.7 percent to $105.6 billion
following a 1.9 percent loss the previous month. Apartment
construction declined 3.7 percent to $18 billion after being
unchanged a month earlier.
   Non-residential spending fell 2.3 percent to $101.8 billion
after a 4.8 percent plunge in August.
   ``The weakness is more pervasive now than it was even three
months ago, when we still had good industrial spending, fairly good
retail and other commercial spending as well as (spending) for
education and hospitals,'' Delano said. ``Those that had been good
are at best holding their own now and the others are continuing to
deteriorate.''
   The often-volatile government spending, which rose 6.5 percent
in August, fell back 5.0 percent in September to $109.3 billion.
Spending on streets and highways, which paced the August advance,
was off 3.5 percent in September.

   The U.S. dollar fell in Europe today, buffeted by
a surge in buying of German marks. Gold was little changed.
   An announcement that Germany's central bank was raising the
Lombard rate, a key interest rate, a half a percentage point to 8.5
percent prompted dealers to sell dollars and buy marks.
   The dollar also lost ground against the British pound after the
British Treasury and the Bank of England denied rumors of a cut in
interest rates, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 130.70 Japanese yen, from
129.35 yen on Wednesday. But later in London, it fell to 130.40
yen. At midday in New York the dollar was trading at 130.56 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9525, from $1.9440 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9513 to buy one pound.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5070 German marks, down from 1.5150;
1.2745 Swiss francs, down from 1.2850; 5.0525 French francs, down
from 5.0725; 1.6980 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7070; 1,129.75
Italian lire, down from 1,135.50, and 1.1650 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1669.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.5063 German
marks, 1.2745 Swiss francs, 1,129.25 Italian lire and 1.1646
Canadian dollars.
   Gold was unchanged in London at a late bid price of $379.75 a
troy ounce. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $380.70,
from $379.25 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 36 cents to close at a bid
$379.25.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.19 a
troy ounce, from $4.22 bid late Wednesday.

   Stock prices showed a modest gain today as
traders studied accumulating evidence of weakness in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.61 to 2,455.94
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 792 up, 649 down and
481 unchanged.
   A collection of reports from the 12 district banks in the

   Interest rates declined in the credit markets in response to
these developments and prospects.
   But stock traders took a warier view, faced with increasing
concern about the outlook for economic growth and corporate
profits.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1&lsqb; at 106|; Philip Morris, up | at 47}; General

   Federal mismanagement of some of the world's
most productive timber lands has cost the government at least $90
million since 1986, an Interior Department audit disclosed
Thursday.
   Mishandling of Bureau of Land Management forests in western
Oregon is the result of financial shortcuts prompted by budget
cutbacks, the department's Office of Inspector General said.
   The report said the BLM lost $90 million by failing to perform
thinning, fertilization and other maintenance that resulted in
fewer trees that could be cut. The BLM estimated it lost 94 million
board feet of timber growth in the fiscal years 1986-89 due to
inadequate management. A board foot is one foot by one foot by one
inch.
   In addition, the BLM has failed to acquire easements to 132,000
acres with 800 million board feet of mature timber valued at $302
million.
   Losses could total as much as $1.7 billion over the forests'
60-to 80-year life cycles, the report said.
   The audit of BLM forestry operations on 2.4 million acres across
18 Oregon counties criticized the agency for failing to explain the
magnitude of the losses to Congress and the Office of Management
and Budget.
   BLM Director Cy Jamison said in response to the review that his
budget requests have been ``somewhat constrained'' by funding
targets provided by the Interior Department, its parent agency.
   ``These targets, which are less than ideal to accomplish the
desired workload, are consistent with the goals of the
administration to reduce federal deficits,'' Jamison said in a memo
to the inspector general's office.
   The audit covering fiscal years 1986-89 noted that BLM forestry
revenues will further decline as additional lands are taken out of
production to protect the threatened northern spotted owl.
   The BLM estimated in June that efforts to save the owl from
extinction may directly affect 23 percent of its lands in western
Oregon, about 553,000 acres, and may indirectly affect another 1.5
million acres there.
   The BLM holdings are ``some of the most productive timber lands
in the world,'' said the audit prepared by assistant inspector
general Harold Bloom.
   Bungling of the forest program is especially costly because the
program historically returns $4.30 for every $1 spent, the audit
said.
   The review questioned whether the BLM will be able to achieve
next year's harvest target of 750 million board feet, because the
agency's funding request for its forestry program was more than 20
percent short of the $66 million needed.
   However, BLM spokesman Joe Zilincar said Thursday that despite
the lower request Congress funded the progam at $66.5 million. He
said he did not know if that action was a result of the audit,
which was completed more than a month ago but not made public until
Thursday.
   ``The funding that we got this year is right on target with what
we need,'' Zilincar said. He said the problems cited in the audit
will be reviewed.
   The audit also discounts BLM claims it can use smaller
fragmented tracts of timber to replace timber from larger tracts of
forests where logging is being banned to protect the rare owl.
   ``Easements for the smaller scattered tracts of timber lands
have not been obtained because the bureau has concentrated on
obtaining legal access for the larger consolidated tracts,'' the
audit said.
   In addition, the audit said the BLM has:
   - Based its budgets on plans to use herbicides to control
underbrush although herbicdes have been banned on Oregon BLM lands
since a federal judge issued an injunction in 1984. Manual efforts
cost three times more than herbicides.
   - Failed to place sufficient priority or secure sufficient funds
for maintenance of the tree plantations, including placing tubes
around seedlings to protect them from wildlife.
   - Failed to perform intensive management programs, including
fertilization and pre-commercial thinning to provide proper spacing
between trees.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decree creating a
new commercial exchange rate for the ruble created confusion and
chaos Thursday in Moscow's hard-currency shops.
   ``Closed for inventory,'' read a sign at the Swiss-Soviet joint
venture shop Sadko.
   ``Sorry, I am taking stock,'' said a counterman at the Kodak
film shop at the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel in central Moscow. A cashier
at the hotel studied a chart listing the different exchange rates.
   Gorbachev introduced the new rate, which took effect Thursday,
with the publication on Oct. 26 of a presidential decree setting
the value of the currency at 1.8 rubles to the dollar in commercial
transactions, nearly 70 percent lower than the official rate.
   The primary goal of the new rate is to make Soviet exports more
competitive while discouraging imports, economic officials said. It
is part of Gorbachev's program to switch from central planning to a
market-based economy in the next two years.
   As of Thursday, there were three government rates, as well as
the black market price of the dollar. These were the official rate
of .56 rubles, the commercial rate of 1.8 rubles and the special,
or tourist, rate of 6.2 rubles. The black market rate is 20 to 25
rubles to the dollar.
   Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the State Foreign Economic
Commission, said the three-tier system should be seen as
transitional while the real value of the ruble emerges.
   He described the official .56-ruble rate as ``obsolete,'' but
said it was being kept for international currency comparisons and
to protect Third World countries whose debts are in rubles.
   ``Gradually, these rates will be brought together, with the
disappearance of the official and special rates. The commercial
rate will become basic,'' he told the government news agency
Novosti.
   But for Soviet citizens, anticipation of the new devalued rate
heightened fears that rubles would be worth less and spurred rumors
that their bank accounts would skrink in value by nearly 70
percent.
   In Moscow, Soviets have been swarming into the handful of
hard-currency shops over the past week and buying foreign goods
ranging from basic foodstuffs to fur coats and car parts.
   ``People heard rumors. They are buying everything they can get
their hands on,'' said a cashier at the Sadko shop, a favorite of
Soviets who were given the right in August to have and spend
foreign currency without explaining its source.
   The rush came despite assurances the government would reimburse
anyone whose holdings in bank accounts were decreased by the
devaluation.
   Sadko and several hard-currency shops in major hotels were
closed Thursday morning, ostensibly for inventory, as bookkeepers
and cashiers grappled with how to handle the new ruble rates.
   ``We are tripling our prices in rubles,'' said Antonina
Maksimova, Sadko's director. However, she said, customers wouldn't
feel the difference because the hard currency price they pay is
unchanged. Cash registers automatically convert the ruble prices at
the commercial rate.
   At the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel ice cream shop, the manager said:
``In dollars, I am charging the same as yesterday'' although the
ruble price is three times higher.
   At other shops, cashiers said they had no instructions. ``We are
charging the old rate,'' said a register worker at Kalinka, a
Soviet-Finnish joint venture. ``Nobody has told us different.''
   In Helsinki, Finland, meanwhile, the Bank of Finland halted
trade with the Soviet Union because of confusion over the new
exchange rates.
   Kari Holopainen, director of Soviet trade at the central bank,
said the bank was not informed which of the three new rates applied
to the ``clearing ruble'' used in Finnish-Soviet trade.
   ``To put it mildly, we are somewhat unsure of what is going
on,'' he said. ``In any case we have stopped all payments in the
clearing-house trade with the Soviet Union for the time being.''
   Since there is no official currency exchange for the
rank-and-file Soviet, the Gorbachev decree only affects those
Soviet citizens possessing money earned legally abroad and banked
in the Soviet Union in the form of rubles.
   None of the three ruble rates now in effect, set artificially by
the Soviet government, reflect the true worth of the currency,
either to companies trading shiploads of commodities or tourists
buying souvenir matryoshka dolls.
   Many companies get around the exchange rates by bartering goods,
such as Pepsico Inc.'s practice of selling Pepsi Cola to the Soviet
Union and taking its profits out of the country in Stolichnaya
vodka and other commodities.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American International Group Inc., a worldwide
insurance company, said Thursday that third-quarter profits rose 4
percent on gains in general and life insurance.
   AIG reported net income of $337 million, or $1.62 per share, in
the three months ended Sept. 30, up from $324 million, or $1.57 per
share, in the 1989 period.
   The company said revenue rose by about 12 percent to $3.9
billion from $3.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.
   AIG said pre-tax operating income for general insurance rose
20.3 percent to $276 million from $230 million a year earlier.
General insurance premiums written for the quarter increased
slightly to $2.3 billion.
   The company's worldwide life insurance operations reported
pre-tax operating income of $117 million in the third quarter, up
14.2 percent.
   AIG said its foreign opererations contributed about half of its
total operating income. It said the foreign underwriting division
showed a profit despite almost $15 million of insured losses from
an earthquake in the Philippines and damages from civil unrest in
Thailand.
   The insurance firm said it increased its general worldwide loss
resevres by $447 million in the quarter to $14.3 billion.
   For the first nine months of 1990, AIG said net income rose 4
percent to $1.06 billion, or $5.13 per share, from $1.02 billion,
or $4.95 per share in the same 1989 period.
   Nine-month revenue was $11.4 billion, up 8.9 percent from $10.4
billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. announced Thursday it would
restructure its operations in the South Pacific, resulting in an
expected 40 cent to 50 cent boost per share to its fourth-quarter
earnings.
   Under the plan, Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. will assume management
responsibilities and ownership of Rank Xerox Ltd.'s operations in
Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore.
   Rank Xerox, based in the United Kingdom, is a joint venture
between Xerox and The Rank Organization PLC. It manufactures and
markets almost all Xerox business products and systems in 80
foreign countries.
   Tokyo-based Fuji Xerox, a joint venture between Rank Xerox and
Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., manufactures and markets Xerox business
equipment in the Far East and Southeast Asia.
   Fuji Xerox will pay a total $410 million to Xerox and Rank Xerox
for the operations. Xerox said it would repay short-term debt from
its net proceeds, which will total approximately $200 million after
taxes and after receipt of a special cash dividend from Rank Xerox.
   The transaction, after taxes and deferrals, is expected to add
40 cents to 50 cents per share to Xerox's fourth-quarter results.
In the 1989 fourth quarter, Xerox earned $212 million, or $1.93 per
share, on revenue of $4.7 billion.
   No layoffs are expected from the restructuring. The South
Pacific operations employ about 6,200 people.
   The new Fuji Xerox company will have its headquarters in
Singapore with about 60 employees.
   The restructuring is subject to approval by various governmental
bodies.

   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at a

7.01 percent during the previous six months, the Treasury
Department said Thursday.
   Catalina V. Villalpando, treasurer of the United States, called
the new rate ``a positive sign for savers and investors who are
looking for competitive rates in today's market.''
   Savings bond interest rates are changed each May 1 and Nov. 1 to
reflect open market rates. They are based on 85 percent of the
yield on five-year Treasury securities, which have averaged 8.46
percent.
   Savings bond yields at redemption are the average of semiannual
market-based rates during the time held, compounded semi-annually,
or a minimum rate, whichever is greater. The current minimum rate

<HEAD>Retired Worker Says TRW Defrauded Air Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TRW Inc. division has been accused in a
whistleblower's lawsuit of inflating bids and double-billing the
Air Force on classified contracts, an attorney said Thursday.
   Frank M. Breene, a retired TRW acquisitions manager, alleges in
the $20 million federal suit that TRW violated the False Claims Act
by submitting false bids and falsely allocating costs between 1982
and 1990.
   Under the False Claims Act, Breene would receive 15 percent to
20 percent of any damages awarded, with the rest going to the
federal government, said Breene's attorney, David Francis Pace.
   TRW spokesman Julian Levine said the lawsuit was ``frivolous and
totally without merit.''
   TRW's Security and Defense Sector, based in Redondo Beach,
produces several highly classified systems, including spy
satellites designed to eavesdrop on foreign radio and telephone
communications.
   The specific nature of the contracts in question cannot be
disclosed because of security concerns, the lawsuit said.
   Breene contends TRW intentionally defrauded the government and
ignored his request that actual accounting figures be used in the
contract proposals.
   The suit does not explain the accounting methods TRW used to
hide any alleged false bids and billings. The allegations involve
complex ratios for allocating costs of production, support, labor
and planning.
   In general, federal rules require contractors to allocate
contract costs to a variety of special accounts, only some of which
are fully reimbursed by the government.
   Rules also require that all work performed under a contract be
paid only from funds in that contract.
   Breene brought the charges in an amended complaint filed under
the federal False Claims Act in June. However, the charges were
sealed while the Justice Department studied whether to join the
case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward Rafeedie lifted the seal Oct.
26 after denying a stipulation to extend the Justice Department's
60-day study period.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Report Economy Declined in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's industrial sector weakened in
October, pushing the overall economy into a decline for the first
time in nearly eight years, said a closely followed survey of
purchasing executives released Thursday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management's survey,
considered one of the best monitors of the nation's economic
heartbeat, contrasted sharply with an assessment Tuesday by the
Commerce Department that said the economy continue to grow. Private
economists agreed with the purchasing managers' more pessimistic
conclusion.
   The association's monthly index of economic activity dropped a
full percentage point to 43.4 percent in October, its lowest level
since it fell to 42.8 percent in December 1982.
   Robert Bretz, chairman of the trade group, said that by falling
under 44 percent, the index reached the point where it signaled a
small decline in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of the nation's economic health.
   Virtually all the components of the index ``confirmed the
growing weakness in manufacturing, which was enough to pull the
overall economy into slightly negative growth,'' Bretz said
   The components include production, new orders, supplier delivery
rates, prices for raw materials, inventory levels and employment.
   Donald Ratajczk, director of economic forecasting at Georgia
State University, said of the purchasing managers report, ``I think
that's a realistic assessment'' of the economy.
   Alan Levinson, an economist with Wefa Group, a private economic
forecasting service based in Bala Cynwd, Pa., also agreed that the
economy was in a decline last month and added, ``My feeling is the
recession probably started in August or September.''
   The purchasing managers' survey and the economists were at odds
with the Bush administration's view of the economy.
   On Tuesday, after the release of a stronger-than-expected GNP
figure for the third quarter, Commerce Undersecretary Michael R.
Darby stated that the government expected the economy would expand
at a modest pace in the fourth quarter and next year.
   But Bretz said of the October results, ``The fourth quarter
began like the third quarter ended, with a decline in the
manufacturing economy.''
   The association's survey of purchasing executives at more than
300 industrial firms around the country found production levels
fell for the third consecutive month as new orders declined
sharply.
   Thirty-one percent of the executives reported production was off
from the previous month, while 52 percent said it was the same and
17 percent reported production was up. That compared with 29
percent reporting lower production in September, 48 percent saying
it was unchanged and 23 saying it was up.
   New orders fell for the fourth straight month.
   Thirty-four percent of the respondents said orders were down, 47
percent reported they were unchanged and 19 percent said they were
up. In September, 30 percent said new orders were off, 47 percent
said they were the same and 23 percent said they had picked up.
   The survey found that export orders grew last month, but their
rate of gain was the smallest in the nearly two years that export
orders have been tallied by the purchasing managers.
   The report also indicated that suppliers' deliveries were
faster, a bad sign because it indicated vendors had less demand for
goods.
   Industrial companies also felt the bite of inflation in October,
the survey showed. Its price index rose to 76.4 percent from 73.4
percent in September, with the increase blamed entirely on fallout
from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Prices for crude oil and chemicals derived from it rose sharply,
but purchasing executives also reported suppliers were using the
Persian Gulf crisis as an excuse to make unnecessary price hikes.
   Employment continued to drop last month, a result of the drop in
production.
   Twenty-eight percent of the respondents said employment fell at
their companies in October, while 63 percent said it was unchanged
and 9 percent said employment rose. In September, 27 percent
reported lower employment, 65 percent reported the same employment
levels, and 8 percent said employment was up.
   Ratajczk noted other evidence that employment continued to
weaken last month. He pointed to Thursday's Labor Department
announcment that initial claims for state unemployment benefits
rose by 33,000 in the week ended Oct. 20 to 454,000.
   The department releases October employment figures on Friday.
   Private economists said they were not surprised by any of the
numbers announced by the purchasing managers.
   ``None of the components of the index just fell out of bed,''
said Levinson. ``Everything continues to be weak.''
   Added Ratajczk, ``This is the beginning. This is what you see
when you are in recession.''

   Stock prices chalked up a moderate gain Thursday
as traders studied accumulating evidence of weakness in the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.62 points to
2,454.95.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
896 up, 618 down and 487 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.27 million
shares, against 156.06 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 191.52 million shares.
   A collection of reports from the 12 district banks in the
Federal Reserve System painted a picture of slumping business
conditions in most sectors of the country.
   On Friday, monthly data from the Labor Department are expected
to show a decline in payroll employment and an increase in the
unemployment rate, probably to 5.8 percent in October from 5.7
percent the month before.
   Separately, the Commerce Department is due to report on the
index of leading economic indicators for September.
   The investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
estimates that the index will show a decline of 0.8 percent, after
falling 1.2 percent in August.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets in response to
these developments and prospects.
   But stock traders took a warier view, faced with increasing
concern about the outlook for economic growth and corporate
profits.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1} at 107\; Philip Morris, up } at 47~; General
Electric, up &rsqb; at 52&rsqb;, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up &rsqb; at 79.
   General Motors rose &lsqb; to 36~ in active trading. After a $2.1
billion charge GM announced Wednesday for plant closings, some
analysts said the company might have improved its chances for
better earnings performance in the future.
   Utilities attracted buyers looking for stocks well insulated
from the effects of recession and likely to benefit from lower
interest rates.
   The five Big Board issues that made new 52-week highs during the
session were all electric utilities in the Sunbelt and Midwest -
Central &amp; South West, up \ at 44&lsqb;; Houston Industries, up &rsqb; at 36&lsqb;;
Union Electric, up \ at 29&lsqb;; Teco Energy, up \ at 30~, and Texas
Utilities, up | at 38&rsqb;.
   Manufacturers Hanover rose 1\ to 17. A company official said his
recent remarks had been ``misinterpreted'' as signaling a possible
cut in the dividend.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.94 billion, or
0.81 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.42 to 167.59.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.98 to 359.80, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.02 at 307.02.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.76 to 330.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 288.90, up 1.11.

   The New York Stock Exchange board Thursday froze
officers' salaries for 1991 and said it expects to reduce staffing
by about 8 percent next year.
   The moves by the nation's largest stock exchange reflect an
entrenched slump on Wall Street that has seen thousands of layoffs
and a decline in business since the 1987 stock market crash.
   John J. Phelan Jr., the NYSE's chairman and chief executive,
said the early retirement program is expected to reduce the
exchange's staff to 1,700 from 1,850. He said nearly 100 jobs have
been cut through attrition this year.
   Exchange officials said about 100 executives would qualify for
the early retirement program and the other 50 jobs would be
eliminated through attrition.
   The expected cuts would drop the NYSE's employment to 1983
levels, Phelan said in a statement.
   The voluntary early retirement plan will offer enhanced pension
payments to managers and professionals who are eligible to retire
at age 55 and have met certain service requirements by Jan. 31.

   Oil prices showed some early strength Thursday
on fighting words from President Bush, but they eventually slid
back and closed slightly lower.
   Light sweet crude oil fell 6 cents to $35.17 per barrel on
contracts for December delivery traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. January delivery contracts were 3 cents higher, while
later months closed lower.
   Thursday's trading session was the fourth straight in which
crude seemed to have little direction for what may be its quietest
week since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August.
   After a series of wild fluctuations in recent sessions that came
on any shred of news or rumor, oil has virtually refused to budge
much this week, even on stronger-than-usual statements from ranking
U.S. officials.
   ``People are getting a little tired of trading the market,''
said Brendan Dolan, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
``They're waiting for substantial news.''
   Dolan said some participants were perhaps staying out on
Thursday as they waited for a late afternoon news conference from
President Bush, who earlier in the day had said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was perhaps more brutal than Hitler.
   ``I think this darn market is just trying to read too much into
every piece of news it can find,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``I've read probably 18 times that
Bush said he's had it with the situation. I don't know whether
these things help it or hinder it.''
   Futures for unleaded gasoline moved higher Thursday. Baker
attributed the rise to news that Venezuela, an important producer
and refiner of petroleum, might have some supply problems.
   Contracts for December delivery were up 2.15 cents at 92.30
cents a gallon.
   Home heating oil fell, as traders responded to figures showing
an adequate stockpile.
   December contracts were off .76 cent at 90.37 cents per gallon.
   On more-distant month contracts, heating oil prices were also
lower at the close, while later contracts for gasoline were mixed.
   Natural gas fell for delivery in the next four months and rose
for delivery in later months.
   The December delivery contract for natural gas was off 1 cent,
at $2.35 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   Assets of the nation's 525 money market mutual
funds fell by $140.4 million in the latest week to $415.39 billion,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$424.2 million increase in fund assets the previous week to a
record $415.53 billion.
   The institute originally said fund assets decreased by $673.1
million that week to $414.44 billion but revised the figures later
to reflect the inclusion of several new funds.
   It said that in the latest week, assets of 259 general purpose
funds rose by $429.7 million to $147.73 billion, assets of 104
broker-dealer funds fell by $475.9 million to $164.72 billion, and
assets of 162 institutional funds fell by $94.2 million to $102.94
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.42 percent from 7.45 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.45 percent from 7.46 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
47 days, up from 46 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.02 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.03 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, rose to 5.06
percent from 5.00 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.63
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.66
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.76 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.79 percent; 7.88 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.90
percent; and 8.03 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.05 percent.

<HEAD>Silver Futures Rise Sharply, Extending Rebound from 15-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices rose sharply Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, extending a recovery from 15-year lows, in a
rally fueled by technical factors and speculation that interest
rates may fall soon.
   On other commodity markets, gold futures rose; platinum futures
fell; crude oil futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mostly
higher; cattle futures fell and pork futures were mixed.
   Silver futures settled 7.6 cents to 7.9 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.256 a troy ounce.
   Gold ended $1.60 to $2.10 higher on the Commodity Exchange with
December at $383.10 a troy ounce; platinum futures were $2.70 to
$2.90 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange with January at
$435.70 a troy ounce.
   Silver prices have risen 5 percent since Monday, when the
December contract touched a 15-year low of $4.05 an ounce amid
perceptions of slackening demand and rising supplies of the metal.
   Analysts said much of silver's recovery reflected technical buy
signals derived from chart analysis.
   Thursday's rally also was prompted by expectations that an
anticipated decline in payroll employment and an increase in the
national unemployment rate will prompt the Federal Reserve Board of
take actions to lower lending rates, said Stephen W. Platt, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The Labor Department is scheduled to release the monthly
employment data on Friday.
   Higher stock prices also supported silver Thursday. The metal's
price tends to respond to economic indicators because silver has
many industrial applications.
   Trader Tim Evans of Deak International Inc., said the silver
market appeared to have established a trading range between $4.25
and $4.35 an ounce.
   ``I would guess that in the short term, barring any major
events, we're going to have a dull trading-range kind of market,''
he said.
   Crude oil and heating oil futures ended mostly lower and
gasoline futures settled mixed in nervous trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ahead of a presidential news conference.
   Light sweet crude oil was .33 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
December at $35.17 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to 1.54
cents lower with December at 90.37 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.1 cents lower to 2.15 cents higher with December at
92.30 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by speculation the United States
will grant export credits to the Soviet Union before Election Day.
   The speculative buying was at least partly fueled by ideas the
Bush administration will take the long-expected step of declaring
the Soviet Union a most-favored trading partner in a id to help
Republican candidates from farm states, said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc., a Chicago-based brokers'
advisory service.
   The most-favored trading designation would make the Soviet Union
eligible for credit on purchases of agricultural commodities. The
Soviets are believed to be seeking export credits to buy U.S. corn
and soybean meal.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to } cent higher with December at
$2.62\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to } cent higher with December at
$2.29} a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with December at
$1.21 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 4 cents higher with
November at $5.96 a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in a day of profit-taking after Wednesday's moderate
gains.
   Pork bellies and near-term hog futures rose, buoyed by higher
cash hog prices and light slaughter levels. The Agriculture
Department estimated a hog slaughter of 304,000 head Thursday
compared with industry expectations for more than 318,000.
   Live cattle futures settled .45 cent lower to .08 cent higher
with December at 77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to
.50 cent lower with November at 87.35 cents a pound; live hogs were
.12 cent lower to .45 cent higher with December at 52.22 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.2 cents higher with
February at 62.45 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Lotus Announces Merger With Atlanta Software Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp., trying to fill
a gap in its product line, announced Thursday it would buy an
Atlanta software firm for $65 million.
   Lotus said it signed a merger agreement with Samna Corp., which
makes word processing products. Samna's software operates with the
increasingly popular Windows graphical system made by Microsoft
Corp., Lotus' main competitor.
   Windows makes it easier for computer users to operate personal
computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and
compatible models.
   If completed, the deal would mark the first acquisition by Lotus
since a proposed $1.5 billion merger with Novell Inc., another
software maker, fell apart at the last minute in May.
   Lotus officials said the $18.84 per-share buyout of Samna would
represent an important step for the company, which saw earnings
plunge by 63 percent in its most recent quarter.
   Lotus has been known more for its 1-2-3 business spreadsheet
program. But Richard Eckel, a company spokesman, said word
processing is the leading segment of the software industry, and
Lotus has been largely absent from that area.
   At the same time, customers have been shifting to software that
operate with graphics, he said.
   Buying Samna will allow Lotus to take advantage of both those
trends, Eckel said.
   Samna will become the word processing division of Lotus,
operating from Atlanta.
   Samna had sales of $10.3 million in the first nine months of
1990, compared with $11 million for all of 1989. But the company
posted a $1.2 million loss over the first three quarters, largely
due to its transition to the graphics-based system.
   Lotus had sales of $556 million in 1989. The Cambridge company
said it would take a one-time charge of $40 million to $50 million
against quarterly earnings when the transaction is completed. It
hopes to complete the transaction by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   A former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. vice president was
charged Thursday with soliciting and demanding payoffs from vendors
hired to construct the world headquarters of the nation's biggest
brokerage firm.
   A four-count information, filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, alleged Merrill Lynch vendors supplied the executive,
Albert Young, with a stretch limousine and chauffeur and helped pay
for his country home in Hawley, Pa.
   Young also allegedly received a $2,900 silver fox coat, a
corporate credit card, furniture and cash payments, some of which
passed hands in a bathroom and stairwell at the company's offices
in the gleaming World Financial Center on the tip of southern
Manhattan.
   The complaint claimed Young received at least $350,000 in cash
and other benefits from contractors between 1984 and 1987 in return
for promises that they would get business with his employer.
   ``The information alleges that Albert Young made clear to
contractors that payments to him or for his benefit would help
contractors to obtain and maintain lucrative Merrill Lynch
contracts,'' the U.S. attorney's office said in a release
announcing the charges.
   Young, 61, of Manhattan, pleaded innocent to conspiracy, mail
fraud and two counts of tax fraud. He was released on a $250,000
bond.
   Young was a company vice president who directed construction of
the headquarters. He resigned from the firm in September 1988.
   The case was referred to the U.S. attorney's office after an
internal investigation revealed irregularities in the way contracts
were awarded, said Merrill Lynch vice president Patrick Murphy, who
is in charge of the firm's security.
   ``We started to get complaints from vendors who were trying to
do business with us and from Merrill Lynch employees that something
was wrong in the way business was being done,'' Murphy said. ``I
think that the complaint covers as much as we know about the
activities.''
   Two other men, including another former Merrill Lynch vice
president, also were charged in the scheme.

   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said Thursday it was laying
off about 6 percent of the investment banking division as rumors
swirled on Wall Street of major cuts at another big firm.
   The reductions come during a prolonged downturn in the financial
industry that has seen thousands of layoffs, management overhauls
and reductions in major business sectors.
   Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jean Andrews said the firm, the
second most profitable on Wall Street last year with $443 million
in earnings, planned to cut 50 professionals from its worldwide
investment banking staff of 800 by the end of the year.
   The division includes mergers and acquisitions, corporate
finance, real estate and capital markets - all areas that have been
hit hard by the decline in the securities industry since the 1987
stock market crash.
   Andrews said the cuts would be across the board, including some
senior executives.
   ``It's in response to the current and expected business
environment for the industry,'' she said. ``Managing in this
environment, you always look at what resources you commit to these
businesses.''
   Morgan last week reported a 29 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, to $71.9 million from $101 million in the same 1989
period. The firm attributed the decline to a sharp drop in merchant
banking and investment banking activity.
   The announcement of layoffs at Morgan came as rumors circulated
widely on Wall Street that First Boston Corp. was planning a major
restructuring to include hundreds of layoffs in coming days.
   Also Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange said it was freezing
executive salaries for 1991 and enacting an early retirement plan
in an effort to trim about 8 percent of its staff next year.
   Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's biggest
securities firm, announced a major restructuring that is expected
to result in hundreds of layoffs.
   ``If people aren't bringing in business, you're running a
loss,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. ``You can't sit back and say, `Times will be get
better, we'll just keep the people.'''
   First Boston workers said talk has focused on staff cuts of up
to 10 percent involving investment banking and back-office
personnel to be announced early next week. The rumors also were
reported in the Wall Street Letter, a weekly trade publication,
this week.
   A First Boston spokesman said the company continuously reviewed
its businesses and some staff reductions were expected by the end
of 1990. But the spokesman said talk of specific layoffs on a
specific date were ``unfounded rumor and speculation.''
   ``It looks like there is a consistent overcapacity vis a vis
customer and client demand. We'll shrink,'' said the spokesman, who
asked not be identified by name.
   First Boston, a division of CS First Boston Inc., has struggled
because of the slump affecting all of Wall Street as well as large
junk-bond ``bridge loans'' to cororate clients that could not be
refinanced.

<HEAD>Olsen: No Layoffs For Now, but Tough Economy Makes Things Trickier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., which has slashed its
payroll without laying off workers, may find it more difficult in
the current economic slump to induce people to leave their jobs,
company president Kenneth Olsen said Thursday.
   But Olsen also said the computer manufacturer should ``do well''
during a recession, and outperform most of its competitors.
   Olsen gave the assessment to shareholders at the company's
annual meeting. The gathering followed a tough year for Digital,
the world's second-largest computer company behind International
Business Machines Corp.
   The company posted its first-ever quarterly loss in July and
announced plans to cut its work force by more than 5,000 jobs
through a costly voluntary severance program. Previously, Digital
had cut its payroll by 3,000 positions.
   Olsen said the company, with sales last year of $13 billion and
a worldwide work force of 123,000, hopes to continue avoiding
layoffs.
   But he added: ``We never have said we won't. Never say never
about anything.''
   When asked if the gloomy economic climate makes it more
difficult to get people to give up their jobs, Olsen said,
``Probably. It turns out normal attrition slows down at bad
times.''
   Company spokesmen said it is too soon to tell how receptive
workers have been to the latest round of voluntary cuts.
   ``You don't stay in business for 33 years without continuously
adjusting your staff,'' Olsen said. ``We always make adjustments.
We always will. We plan to be in a fast-changing business
forever.''
   He said, however, ``I feel confident that we will do well in a
recession. That does not mean we will live like we do in good
times, ... but that we will do better than most of our
competition.''
   Shareholders at the meeting repeatedly expressed concern about
what Digital is doing to improve its profitability. Digital's
stock, which approached $200 per share before the October 1987
stock market crash, lately has been worth about one-fourth that
amount. On Thursday it closed at $48.62{ a share, up $1.12{.
   Olsen said despite recent troubles, Digital is in a strong
position, having invested $1.5 billion in new products last year
and holding $1.6 billion in cash.
   Part of the company's new strategy is to change its VAX
computers so they can run software designed for the popular Unix
operating system. That means companies equipped with both VAX and
Unix-based computers could run the same software for all,
reflecting a trend in the computer industry toward ``open,'' rather
than proprietary systems.
   ``Unix is fun, exciting,'' Olsen said. ``Our strategy is to do
it all.''
   Analysts say Digital, like some other Massachusetts computer
companies, has been hurt by a slump in the market for midsize
minicomputers. Their functions have increasingly been swallowed by
powerful desktop machines called workstations.
   But Olsen disputed the notion of a minicomputer slump, claiming
workstations fit within that category.
   Still, he predicted the computer industry will undergo
fundamental changes. ``The world needs very few computer
manufacturers, just like it needs very few auto manufacturers,'' he
said.
   Olsen, who founded Digital and is now 64 years old, also told
shareholders he does not foresee retiring before he has a chance to
see current strategies come to fruition.
   ``I am more enthusiastic than ever,'' he said.

   The agency dismantling failed savings
institutions said Thursday it sold $435 million of home equity
loans once owned by a failed New Jersey S&amp;L.
   Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, paid $444 million for the
loans - 2.1 percent more than their face value, the Resolution
Trust Corp. said.
   The portfolio consists of 15,700 loans with average outstanding
balances of $27,639. The adjustable-rate credit lines have unused
credit totaling $430 million. Ninety percent of the homes securing
the loans are in New Jersey and 8 percent in Florida.
   The loans were previously owned by City Federal Savings Bank of
Bedminster, N.J. Once the largest S&amp;L in the state, it was seized
by the government Dec. 8. Last month, regulators sold City
Federal's Florida branches and nine of its 75 New Jersey offices.

   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. took another step toward
reducing its debt burden Thursday, saying it was selling up to $150
million in additional equity to current outside shareholders.
   The retailer said four shareholders - GE Capital Corp., Loews
Corp., Mutual Series Fund and Taubman Investment Co. - have made
commitments to buy a minimum of $100 million in Macy stock.
   The company, which is still paying the bills from a 1986
debt-financed management-led buyout, said in a statement it would
use proceeds of the sale to purchase some its outstanding bonds.
Macy also sold a 1 percent equity stake in August and used the
proceeds to retire $50 million in junk bonds.
   The company told investors last week it planned more sales of
stock to reduce liabilities. Macy said it was ``exploring the
possibility of selling a more substantial equity interest to a
buyer who shares our view of Macy's value and future.''
   The sale announced Thursday did not appear to be the transaction
Macy said last week it was contemplating.
   The retailer has been seeking to cut its debt load since a
disappointing Christmas 1989 sent its losses soaring and raised
questions about Macy's ability to pay its bills.
   Last month, Macy announced it was selling its credit operations
to GE Capital for approximately $100 million. Macy said the move
would remove $1.5 billion from its $4.8 billion debt burden.
   Macy also told investors last week it was prepared for another
difficult Christmas. With a flagging economy and unresolved Middle
East crisis, consumers have cut their spending back sharply and the
entire retail industry is expecting a bleak holiday shopping
season.
   Macy said it has reduced its inventory, cut expenses and planned
conservatively going into the Christmas period.
   The retailer said last week it had lost $215.3 million in the
fiscal year ended July 28, compared with a loss of $63 million in
fiscal 1989. Sales rose to $7.27 billion from $6.97 billion the
previous year.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club, Fantasies by Morgan Taylor and Aeropostale, which are
stocked with Macy's private label apparel brands.

Patent Dispute</HEAD>

   IBM agreed to pay a Scottish manufacturer of
computer memory devices an undisclosed amount to settle a patent
infringement suit, the two companies said Thursday.
   The settlement could result in other payments by computer makers
to the company, Rodime PLC, since its patents cover the most widely
used type of internal memory device for personal computers, the
3{-inch magnetic hard disc drive.
   ``In Rodime's opinion, a large number of the 3{-inch disk drives
being manufactured do infringe'' on the patents, said John
Altmiller, an attorney with Kenyon &amp; Kenyon in Washington, D.C.,
who represents Rodime.
   Neither International Business Machines Corp. nor Rodime would
disclose the size of the lump-sum payment IBM made. IBM spokesman
Brian Doyle did say that it would have no effect on the company's
earnings.
   As part of the settlement, IBM and Rodime also agreed to
cross-license each other's patents covering the disk drives, the
companies said.
   ``Is this a win for Rodime and a loss for IBM? No, we don't
think so,'' Doyle said. ``We felt both parties would be getting
something out of it. It was a negotiated settlement. Each party
believed that the other was using its patents.''
   James Swent, Rodime's chief financial officer, said Rodime's
primary aim was to gain acknowledgment from the world's largest
computer company that Rodime's patents were valid.
   Rodime, based in Glenrothes, Scotland, also has a lawsuit
pending against Conner Peripherals Inc. of San Jose, Calif., a
major disk drive maker. That suit was stayed pending the outcome of
the IBM suit, Swent said.
   ``Obviously the two companies will be in discussions and we will
have to decide whether we continue the stay,'' he said by telephone
from Rodime's U.S. headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla.
   He added that he expected similar discussions would take place
with other makers of 3{-inch disk drives.
   ``We expect to enforce our patents. We would hope that it would
not involve litigation,'' he said.
   Rodime, which makes its disks in Singapore and Scotland,
reported a loss of $41.5 million, including a restructuring charge
of $12 million, for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1989, Swent
said. Revenue totaled $96 million.
   The 10-year-old company, whose shares are traded as American
depositary receipts on the national over-the-counter market, has
reported losses the past three years. Fiscal 1990 earnings have not
yet been reported.

   One measure of the nation's money supply rose
and another fell in the week ended Oct. 22, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,318.7 billion from $3,323.0 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,091.0 billion from $4,089.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $818.8 billion from $819.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 4 percent, which
is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The
growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.6 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,310.3 billion, a 4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,088.7 billion, up 2 percent, while M1 rose
5.5 percent to an average of $818.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $469 million in
the week ended Oct. 24.
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $399 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$346 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $318.8 billion two weeks earlier.

   ``We will look to Smith Barney for assistance in developing and

   HBJ said Wednesday that it was selling its small group health
insurance business to the Bradford National Life and Lamar Life
companies.
   HBJ will retain its large general insurance division, officials
said.
   HBJ began underwriting group life and health insurance two years
ago but never earned a profit. The group business had revenue of
about $27 million a year, only about 6 percent of HBJ's total
insurance revenue of $456.3 million last year.
   A sale price was not disclosed.
   Seventy-eight employees in Orlando will be laid off as a result
of the sale, Franklin said.
   HBJ employs about 800 people in its insurance division and 700

<TEXT>
   Aircraft-engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada
Inc. Thursday announced plans to lay off between 1,000 and 1,200
workers, about 12 percent of its workforce.
   The company cited a downturn in demand for small jets in the
United States for the cuts.
   Louise Boutin, company spokeswoman, said a significant number of
orders have been cancelled, but she wouldn't specify how many.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada employs 9,490 in the Montreal area,
Toronto and Halifax. Its sister company, Pratt &amp; Whitney, based in
East Hartford, Conn., employs about 39,000.
   Both companies are owned by United Technologies Corp.
   Pratt supplies engines for corporate jets, regional commuters
and other markets. Its major clients include Boeing, de Havilland
and Cessna.
   The company will decide where the cuts are to be made by early
December and departments throughout the company will assess their
needs in the next month, Boutin said.
   ``We have to reduce production starting in January 1991,'' she
said.
   Last June, Pratt eliminated 400 jobs because of cancelled
orders. Attrition made up most of the cuts with 134 workers laid
off, Boutin said.

<HEAD>Ousted Thrift Chairman Fights $30.8 Million Restitution Order</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS second graf to UPDATE with deadline delayed until hearing

<TEXT>
   Ousted CenTrust Chairman David Paul, whose swank
personal life has come to symbolize excesses in the savings &amp; loan
crisis, is fighting a $30.8 million restitution order from thrift
bailout regulators, accusing them of ``an Alice in Wonderland
approach to due process.''
   Paul faced a deadline Thursday for submitting securities to
cover the claim from the Office of Thrift Supervision, but his
attorneys won a delay until a court hearing is held, probably next
week.
   Paul's response doesn't answer specifics of the government
complaint, which charges the head of Florida's once-largest savings
and loan immersed himself in luxury ranging from $1,100-a-night New
York hotel suites to flown-in European chefs, in order ``to satisfy
his insatiable vanity and ego.''
   Instead, his attorneys challenged the legality of the Oct. 22
order, saying any alleged misconduct occurred before the bailout
law was passed last year.
   Paul, 51, reportedly is the subject of a federal criminal
investigation for his CenTrust reign, but no charges have been
filed to date.
   His attorneys charge the government's demand for the $30.8
million ``imposes unprecedented and oppressive conditions ... in
that it purports (without legal authority) to seize all the
personal assets of Paul and his family.''
   The civil proceedings are ``an Alice in Wonderland approach to
due process, where execution comes before the trial,'' Paul's
attorneys charged.
   They asked for a speedy hearing, but U.S. District Court Judge
Edward Davis hadn't set one by Thursday afternoon.
   Thrift regulators went after Paul amid congressional pressure to
recoup some of the billions of dollars in losses associated with
the S&amp;L crisis. The federal takeover of CenTrust last February is
costing taxpayers $1.8 billion.
   A $15 million legal defense fund for CenTrust officers and
directors was described by regulators as a ``slush fund'' that
included CenTrust's most marketable securities, leaving the S&amp;L
with poorer quality securities. U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno
on Wednesday upheld the government's seizure of the fund.
   Paul's lavish ways have long been a subject of public scrutiny.
Regulators already have sold or put up for auction $29 million in
paintings, a $233,000 sailboat, Limoges china and Baccarat crystal
allegedly bought by CenTrust primarily for Paul's use and comfort.
   Court papers filed by thrift-bailout attorneys, disclosed for
the first time with Paul's filing, document some of the suspect
purchases, Paul's use of them and limited regulatory efforts to
keep his assets separate from CenTrust funds.
   For example, in December 1988, CenTrust spent $122,726 to bring
six European chefs to Paul's Miami Beach home for a Great Chef's
Dinner attended by 56 guests. Another $6,300 was spent for a
CenTrust employee's trip to Paris for planning.
   Paul reimbursed the thrift for the dinner after the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board questioned the expense, but the employee's trip
wasn't covered. Even with the reimbursement, OTS charged CenTrust's
payment ``would at the very least have constituted an unrecorded,
unapproved and unsecured illegal loan.''
   In another example, in August 1988, CenTrust spent $15,000 on an
insurance policy in case one-tenth of an inch of rain fell on a
clambake at Paul's Connecticut residence, capping a three-day
meeting of CenTrust executives. A $50,000 payout on the policy was
to be split by CenTrust and Paul.
   The thrift paid $53,000 for an executive suite at Joe Robbie
Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins, in April 1989 after CenTrust
reported a net operating loss of $19 million in the previous
quarter, regulators said.
   CenTrust's 47-story office tower, a stunning addition to Miami's
skyline, featured 24-karat golf leaf ceilings above a $1 million
marble staircase, they said.
   Regulators counted $26,000 in CenTrust spending in December 1985
for Paul's leased Mercedes-Benz limousine in Miami, $40,000 for the
June 1987 purchase of a Lincoln-Continental limousine for Paul's
use in New York City, plus $7,000 for additional limousine services
in 1987.
   Paul's lodging at the New York's Stanhope Hotel in 1988
generated $45,000 in expenses that pushed the nightly room expense
to $1,186.
   Paul reimbursed CenTrust $97 for $35,000 worth of Tiffany
stationery, engraved cards, matches, cocktail napkins and other
items used by the chairman or bought as gifts for non-employees.

<HEAD>Cigna's Earnings Drop 92 percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigna Corp. on Thursday reported a 92
percent drop in third-quarter earnings, partly blaming losses in
the insurance company's property and casualty division and a
reorganization.
   Earnings totaled $11 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenues
of $4.69 billion. That compares with $146 million, or $1.81 a
share, on revenues of $4 billion for the same three-month period in
1989.
   Cigna attributed part of the decline to after-tax charges of $98
million. Consolidating field offices for the property and casualty
operations cost $59 million; withdrawing from the car insurance
market in Massachusetts cost $22 million; and costs related to the
integration of Equicor, which Cigna acquired March 29, totaled $17
million.
   ``Overall results were unsatisfactory for the third quarter,''
said Wilson H. Taylor, Cigna chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``Our employee benefits, pension and individual life businesses
all were strong contributors to earnings. Property and casualty
results, however, continue to reflect inadequate industry price
levels,'' he said.
   The property and casualty division showed a $79 million loss,
compared with a $54 million loss in the 1989 third quarter.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Cigna reported earnings of
$211 million, or $2.74 a share, compared with $378 million, or
$4.64 a share, in 1989.
   Revenues for the nine-month period were $13.4 billion in 1990,
compared to $11.5 billion in 1989.
