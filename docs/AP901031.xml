   The spoken and sung messages of some of
Nashville's top recording artists will be sent to American troops
in Saudi Arabia within the next month, record company officials
announced Wednesday.
   Ten national record companies will ship up to 150,000 cassettes
of country and gospel music to the Middle East through the newly
launched ``Operation Desert Song'' project, said Ken Harding of New
Haven Records.
   The effort appears to be the largest of its kind in the country,
said Harding, who helped spearhead the project. Two similar but
smaller projects were recently launched in Los Angeles, he added.
   Already, record companies have donated 120,000 tapes to the
project and another 30,000 are expected by the end of November. he
tapes will be sent to the Defense Department for distribution.
   Organizers did not specifically name performers to be featured
on the music tapes. Instead, they said the cassettes would
represent every recording artist signed to a major record label in
Nashville.
   That would include performers such as Kenny Rogers, Dolly
Parton, Willie Nelson, George Strait, Hank Williams Jr., Clint
Black, Randy Travis, Reba McEntire, the Judds, Garth Brooks, Kathy
Mattea, the Kentucky HeadHunters, Ricky Van Shelton, Alabama,
Waylon Jennings, Amy Grant, Take 6 and Sandi Patti.
   Also to be sent are 500 copies of a videotape with messages from
country and gospel music singers.
   Some of the messages:
   From McEntire, ``Hurry up and come home 'cause we miss you.
Thanks for keeping us safe.''
   From Tammy Wynette, ``Hang in there until November. I promise
I'm coming over to sing to all of you.''
   From Lee Greenwood, ``I believe in what you are doing and all
Americans support you.''
   Gov. Ned McWherter also appeared on the tape, saying he hoped
troops were back home ``in time to go squirrel hunting, duck
hunting and for Christmas.''
   Maj. Gen. Carl Wallace, head of the Tennessee National Guard,
told a news conference announcing the project that the tapes would
boost U.S. morale in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Next to being there, it's one of the best things that can be
done,'' Wallace said.

<HEAD>Magellan's Mapping of Venus to Resume by Nov. 8</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magellan's mapping of Venus will resume
next week after engineers repair a computer programming glitch that
makes the spacecraft's solar power panels wobble, NASA says.
   Magellan on Friday suspended its $744 million effort to make
pictures and maps because of the solar panel problem and because
its communications with Earth are being hindered by the sun, which
is lined up between Venus and Earth.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory expects to fix the computer
software so Magellan can resume taking radar pictures by Nov. 7 or
8, Magellan experiment representative Steve Wall said Wednesday.
   The twin solar panels are essential for recharging Magellan's
batteries, but the wobbling hasn't hurt their ability to gather
solar energy.
   The craft was launched from a space shuttle in May 1989 and
arrived at Venus on Aug. 10. It has made pictures of volcanoes,
huge solidified lava flows, faults, craters and 600-mile-wide,
mile-high bulges on Venus.

   A screaming crowd of nearly 1,000
pro-homosexual activists mobbed the entrance of an auditorium to
protest a Halloween night Christian crusade aiming exorcise the
city of evil spirits.
   They blocked buses bringing the faithful to the meeting, which
they contend is a thinly veiled attack on homosexuality.
   ``We're queer, we're here; get used to it,'' they chanted.
``Born again bigots, go away; racist, sexist, anti-gay.''
   The focus of their wrath was a ``Prayer Breakthrough'' for at
least 5,000, organized by Texas evangelist Larry Lea and San Jose
minister Dick Bernal. They say the City by the Bay is plagued by
immoral homosexuals, crime, witchcraft and general sin.
   ``We're praying to God for people, all people, and against the
powers of darkness,'' Bernal said earlier. ``The ultimate goal is
to save the fallen angels of the city from Satan, from evil
immorality.''
   Despite the protest, the meeting started on time with the
faithful jumping up and down and singing.
   Evangelicals from some 250 northern California churches needed
police to pull them bodily through the crowd to the Civic Center
Auditorium. Once inside the doors, they were roughly grabbed by
badge-wearing monitors and sentries. They bags were searched. Some
stood for a pat-down search.
   ``You come in here for a Christian activity and they search you
like a thief,'' said one of the revivalists.
   ``Jesus is Lord,' reminded a woman next to him, shaking a fist
at the crowd through the glass doors.
   Outside, the screaming was at a ear-splitting level. The
protesters lifted a 12-foot-high paper penis in the form of a cross
in front of barricades guarded by dozens of visored police.
   Police eventually separated the two groups, keeping the
demonstrators across the street.
   The demonstration started an hour before the ``prayer warriors''
began their program and broke up about an hour after it started.
Many of the protesters headed for the predominantly gay Castro
district, where thousands usually gather on Halloween.
   A war of words raged all day in this city that takes advantage
of Halloween to flaunt it non-conformity.
   ``They'll end up in the hell they deserve with their
narrow-minded views,'' said Sister Missionary DeLight, founder of
the 11-year-old Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, said of the
evangelists. ``I think it's scary that they think we're a real
threat to society.''
   DeLight - who is a man - was dressed in a nun's habit and curled
fairy shoes and held a wand during a pagan ceremony Tuesday across
from the hall where the prayer warriors were to meet.
   Lea, who distributes ``prayer army dog tags'' and has donned
military fatigues in previous crusades, said Halloween was selected
to launch his three-day assault on evil and sin because, according
to legend, demons are strongest at that time.
   ``This is not just kids having fun,'' Lea said. ``There is
actual worship of the devil.''
   As the evening wore on, an estimated 300,000 revelers were
expected to camp it up in the Castro district. Police barricaded 15
square blocks instead of the usual four and a stage was set up on
Market Street to lure partiers away from the most crowded areas.
   ``This is just good clean fun for us, a celebration of our
lifestyle,'' said Joe Van Es-Ballesteros, organizer of the drag
extravaganza.
   A group called Grand Homosexual Outrage at Sickening
Televangelists - GHOST - was formed to engage in the spiritual
warfare with Lea and Bernal.
   ``Lea's characterization of the city as being ruled by spirits
of perversity and witchcraft is nothing but thinly veiled
homophobia and fear-mongering,'' said GHOST member Mark Pritchard.
``We intend to show that San Francisco is a diverse community of
people who love peace and freedom.''
   Tim Lavender, vice president of the Larry Lea Ministries, denied
the Christians hate homosexuals and others with different
lifestyles.
   ``We're not here to pray against the gays or any group of
people,'' Lavender said. ``We are here to pray for a return to
traditional values. ... This is an opportunity for all Christians
to come together.''
   Lavender said the ``so-called peace-loving'' people in San
Francisco who oppose the religious right have been calling Lea and
Bernal with death threats since the prayer event was announced in
September.
   ``We're not trying to provoke any type of violence,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, city workers washed sidewalks in front of the
auditorium to erase at least one dozen red, spray-painted threats
that said: ``Kill The Christian.''
   Last summer, Lea turned out 6,000 exorcists in Anaheim for a
three-day ``Prayer Breakthrough'' to ``inflict serious damage'' on
forces of darkness in southern California. Nearly 7,000 believers
showed up to help him ``clobber the devil'' in Chicago where they
brandished imaginary swords and spoke in tongues.

<HEAD>132-Year-Old Sailing Ship Looking for Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's oldest active sailing ship, built of
Spanish pine 132 years ago, may creak and groan but it's looking
for work.
   ``Sailing ships are no longer commercial so there is no reason
for her existence except her existence and I will do anything to
keep this ship going,'' said Mark Litchfield, skipper of the
127-ton brig, Maria Asumpta.
   Bunting fluttered between the two masts as Litchfield welcomed
potential hirers and sponsors at a shipboard reception Wednesday in
St. Katharine's Dock near the Tower of London.
   ``As she costs nearly 200,000 pouns ($388,000) a year to
maintain and run in a full 10-month season, there's a lot of work
to be done in raising money,'' Litchfield said.
   For the crew, it's more of a romance than a job.
   ``It is a living spirit and if you were aboard for a week you
would know that too,'' deckhand Michael ``Spike'' Jenkins said
Wednesday.
   ``She's all wood and natural rope, not clinical like a steel
ship,'' he said.
   Lucy Taylor, 29, the only woman among a crew of 10, said she got
tired of teaching in an eastern England primary school and answered
an advertisement for ship's cook.
   ``I always had a subconscious dream to sail on a tall ship,''
she said. ``It's a very free way of life and we are together as a
community.''
   ``I feel attached to the ship - it's like a person. I was away
on land for a week and when I came back and saw it I cried. This is
the first job I have done that I haven't wanted to leave.''
   The Maria Asumpta is in the Guinness Book of World Records as
the world's oldest active square-rigged sailing ship.
   The brig was built in Badalona, near Barcelona, in 1858, for
trans-Atlantic trade, carrying rum, molasses, tobacco and spices
from the Caribbean and returning with up to 500 tons of cargo.
   The Maria Asumpta was discovered in 1980 lying as a hulk in
Malaga, southern Spain, by Litchfield and a friend, Robin
Cecil-Wright.
   It was about to be towed to sea and burned, the usual fate of
many old wooden ships.
   The two Englishmen bought the ship and spent 18 months restoring
it, then sailed it to England. It crossed the Atlantic in 1984,
spent three years in the Great Lakes and came back in 1988.
   ``I believe that feat, under sail, was never achieved before by
a vessel 130 years old,'' said Litchfield, a 49-year-old former
Royal Navy officer.
   The ship is hired for parties and promotions, film work and sail
training and turns up at seaport festivals and regattas.
   It is 11 years older than the famous clipper Cutty Sark, now
preserved in a London dry dock at Greenwich in southeast London.
   Deckhand Charles Smith, 43, from the Shetland Islands north of
Scotland, said it's noisy in the old ship at sea and he likes to
hear the creaking of the timbers.
   ``It's talking to you,'' he said.
   ``Of course it if didn't creak, it would break apart.''

<HEAD>Netherlands Becoming Less of a Haven for Refugees</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIJSBERGEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Netherlands is tightening the
rules on asylum because it hasn't enough money, housing and jobs
for all the poor refugees flooding in.
   Holland is a historic haven for the oppressed. It sheltered the
Pilgrims, who fled religious persecution in England, before they
sailed for the New World.
   A decade ago, in 1980, only 1,330 people claimed refugee status
in the Netherlands. This year, the number is expected to reach
20,000 and the government threatens to jail aliens who make
unjustified requests for asylum.
   Dutch officials contend most asylum seekers are economic
refugees looking for easier lives in this high-tech welfare state.
   Hundreds of people have come from economically depressed Eastern
Europe in recent months, and the government fears a new rush of
arrivals if the Persian Gulf crisis turns into war.
   The Netherlands subscribes to the U.N. definition of political
refugees as those fleeing persecution on ideological grounds, and
is reluctant to stretch its welfare resources in a time of economic
uncertainty.
   Jobs, housing and tolerance are getting scarce, and only about
13 percent of asylum requests are approved.
   ``This is one of the most densely populated countries in the
world,'' said Maurice van Hezik, spokesman for the Justice
Ministry. ``There's pretty high unemployment among the non-Dutch
population. If you were to admit people who only come to work, that
would make the problem worse.''
   One asylum seeker, Sara Amini of Iran, claims she was persecuted
at home for being a member of a small opposition party in Iran.
   When she arrived last summer with her husband and two children,
she expected the free housing and allowances that used to be given
nearly all asylum seekers.
   Instead, they were jammed into a 15-foot-square room at a former
convent school in Rijsbergen, one of 23 refugee camps in Holland.
   ``I heard people in the Netherlands were very friendly, very
helpful compared to other European people,'' She said in an
interview. ``I didn't expect it to be like this.''
   People seeking asylum in the Netherlands used to be taken to
government-subsidized housing projects and given social welfare
payments equivalent to about $800 a month.
   In 1987, however, an influx of ethnic Tamils fleeing the civil
war in Sri Lanka gave rise to what critics call the ``bed, bath and
bread'' program.
   The government opened 15 refugee camps, including Rijsbergen, to
house asylum seekers during processing.
   Aad Kosto, deputy justice minister, said this summer he would
jail those who sought asylum without good reason and might flee the
camps and try to lose themselves in the population.
   Only a few people have been jailed, but the practice is expected
to become more common in the effort to stop rejected asylum seekers
from joining the estimated 50,000 to 60,000 illegal aliens in this
nation of 14.6 million.
   Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers summoned the mayors of eight towns
and villages in September and told them each would be host to a new
refugee camp. He said the first busloads of people were on their
way.
   Seven more camps are planned by the Welfare Ministry, which is
buying 500 mobile homes.
   Van Hezik said some people admit they've only come for jobs, and
others offer ``the strangest stories.''
   He cited the case of a Third World refugee who claimed to have
arrived on a ship bound for Switzerland, which is landlocked. Van
Hezik said the man apparently hoped to be expelled to that country.
   In early August, Romanians began pouring into Eindhoven in
southern Holland. Radio Free Europe, the U.S.-sponsored station,
had described the city as hospitable to strangers, van Hezik said.
   Hundreds of East Europeans have made their way to the
Netherlands and the Persian Gulf may provide the next source of
refugees, said Jan Tielemans, director of the Rijsbergen camp.
   ``We'll probably be noticing the side effects . . . the Indians,
the Sri Lankans who are huddling in Jordan, Eygptians too,'' he
said. ``We won't know for another few months.
   ``Some of these people are simply looking for a living, and they
think one of the ways they'll get it is by asking for asylum.''
   A 26-year-old Iraqi at Rijsbergen said he deserted Saddam
Hussein's army days before it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``I was sick and tired of it all,'' said the man, who identified
himself as an artillery sergeant born in Yemen but would not give
his name. ``I just wondered what would happen if I deserted.''
   He said he hid in a helicopter belonging to the Red Crescent,
the Moslem version of the Red Cross, which took him from his
position near Basra in the south to the Kurdistan region of
northwestern Iraq, then crossed into Turkey.
   The Iraqi said he reached Amsterdam by ship, and acknowledged he
stood ``very little chance'' of being accepted as a refugee.
   ``If they're willing to listen, I'll tell my story,'' he said.
``If not, the world is big enough.''

<HEAD>CenTrust Chairman Falls Hard From Ranks of Miami Elite</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Paul, entrepreneur and real estate developer,
was by all accounts a stranger when he arrived in the early 1980s
and bought a dying Miami thrift.
   By the late '80s, the chairman of CenTrust Bank had been
embraced by Miami's establishment and accepted into the inner
sanctums of civic leadership. And Paul enjoyed an extravagant
lifestyle and had deep pockets matched by few in this city of
risk-takers and jet-setters.
   Trouble was, financial regulators say, he was using CenTrust
depositors' money to support his philanthropy and lavish
expenditures.
   They contend Paul's spending habits contributed to CenTrust's
collapse, at $1.8 billion one of the nation's biggest savings and
loan failures.
   And now the federal government wants Paul to reach into his
pockets and return $30.8 million.
   Paul, 51, is accused of using CenTrust as his own personal piggy
bank. Regulators say depositors' money paid for gold-plated
bathroom plumbing and a $29-million art collection that included a
$13-million painting by Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens. The
artwork was later sold for a loss.
   ``We can't find ... anyone who has been so involved in
conspicuous consumption,'' said Thomas P. Mason, public affairs
officer for the Office of Thrift Supervision in Washington.
   Once a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, Paul also has become
something of a political pariah.
   Gov. Bob Martinez and Democratic challenger Lawton Chiles have
criticized each other for their routine political dealings with
Paul. And Paul's contact with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has become
an issue in his race against Republican challenger Jim Rappaport.
   Maurice Ferre, a former Miami mayor, reflected several months
ago about Paul's acceptance in business and civic circles: ``In
hindsight, it was a misjudgment, but David Paul is a spectacular
guy. He's a super salesman, a gambler. And Miami is a place where
people are awed by money as a status symbol of achievement.''
   Paul, who has until Nov. 1 to pay the $30.8 million restitution
or post bond for that amount, has been in Israel and could not be
reached for comment. His Miami attorney, Sanford Bohrer, says the
government action has no merit and will be vigorously contested.
   ``His problems aren't over by a long shot,'' acknowledged
Terence McElroy, spokesman for the state Office of the Comptroller.
   But Bill Cullom, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of
Commerce argues that Paul shouldn't take all the blame for the
federal takeover of CenTrust, once the biggest S&amp;L in the
Southeast.
   ``Every single savings and loan in the United States had board
members and they were allowing these things to happen. ... It's
unacceptable to me for the bank examiners to come in and play
Monday morning quarterback,'' he said.
   That sentiment was echoed by a former CenTrust board member, one
of the few willing to comment on Paul.
   ``There was a time that CenTrust was riding the crest and making
lots and lots ofprofit,'' said Jessie McCrary, an attorney and
civic leader. ``While they blame Paul for the demise of CenTrust,
what do they say when he resurrected Dade Federal from oblivion?''
   Paul acquired the failing thrift in 1983 and the following year
renamed it CenTrust. He made earnings soar through liberal
accounting practices and an extensive junk-bond portfolio, much of
it purchased from the investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
Inc.
   The 47-story CenTrust Tower, a downtown Miami landmark, was lit
nightly; Paul changed the colors on the building during the
holidays or when it was requested for a community event.
   The flamboyant bank chairman, who collected a salary of $4.8
million plus other compensation from January 1988 to September
1989, donated to local universities and causes such as the campaign
against casino gambling. In all, he gave some $1.7 million over a
three-year period.
   Then the roof started caving in, in 1989. The bank's losses
mounted, and a published report showed Paul had lied on his
official CenTrust biography, including that he had a Ph.D. from
Harvard and an MBA from Columbia University. He didn't.
   Regulators seized control of CenTrust this year and in June, the
bank was sold to Great Western Bank of California.
   His La Gorce Island residence is for sale at $9.5 million, and
his $7 million customized yacht, Grand Cru, was sold for a cut-rate
$3 million.
   ``He was, for all appearance, a very good corporate citizen,''
said Cullom, the chamber of commerce president. ``All of these
things are just coming to light. How could we know as a civic
community what was going on?''

   The Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is the
winner of the top award in the Freedom of Information competition
of the Associated Press Managing Editors association.
   The Sun-Sentinel was selected for a series of articles on
Florida's failure to impose adequate controls on care centers,
leading to client deaths and injuries among such diverse groups as
infants, retarded adults and teen-age criminals.
   The 20th annual award was presented Wednesday at the APME
convention by David Hawpe, editor of The Courier-Journal of
Louisville, Ky., and chairman of the APME FOI committee.
   Three citations also were awarded for extraordinary effort
toward a better-informed citizenry. They were signed by Hawpe and
APME President Gene Foreman of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and
presented to:
   -The Detroit News for an investigation tracing payments from a
secret Detroit police fund, through which more than $1 million in
taxpayer money was laundered.
   -The Daily Reflector of Greenville, N.C., for revelations
concerning the background of a candidate for Superior Court judge,
resulting in legislation opening the records of the North Carolina
Judicial Standards Commission.
   -The Hartford (Conn.) Courant for an examination of the
government's military recruiting system, which suggested that it
promotes corruption, undermines quality of the armed forces, and
costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
   The APME comprises managing editors and other news executives of

   Burg, 74, has been an APME member for 23 years, serving two
terms as a director and also as treasurer. He has chaired a variety
of committees that study industry issues.
   In recent years, he assembled The Red Book, an annual account of
the organization's conventions and studies.
   Mike Waller, editor of the Hartford Courant, on Wednesday
presented a plaque to Burg at the APME annual meeting in Dallas,
describing him as ``the nicest, kindest human being in the world.''
   Burg said he values his long association with the APME, which
comprises managing editors and other news executives of AP member
newspapers.
   ``It's the best group. It gets into every facet of the news
business, and there's a good cross-section of people, from small
and large papers,'' he said. ``I've never met anyone in this
organization I didn't like.''
   The Meritorious Service Award was first presented last year. It
went to Hu Blonk, editor of the Wenatchee, Wash., World in 1954-74
and a longtime crusader for open government.
   The APME meeting continues through Friday.

   Former President Reagan breezed down memory
lane in a visit to his hometown, leading 225 flag-waving children
in the Pledge of Allegiance and bashing Democrats and Saddam
Hussein when he got the chance.
   Greeted by adoring crowds Tuesday on a visit that coincided with
the release of his memoirs, Reagan ate lunch at the first house in
Dixon where the Reagan family lived. It is now a museum.
   He talked with old friends and skipped stones at the swimming
hole where, local legend has it, he saved 76 people as a lifeguard
over seven summers.
   He stopped at the now-vacant grade school he attended.
   ``I love and remember Dixon as the place I always know I can
come home to,'' Reagan said of this town of 15,700 about 100 miles
west of Chicago.
   Reagan said the Democratic-controlled Congress forced the new
budget on the Bush administration, and he denounced Saddam for
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We have to keep up the pressure until that madman gives up,''
he said.

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Theodore Bikel admits his one-man
show of folk songs and show tunes isn't the usual casino fare.
   But Bikel said Tuesday the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino was
enterprising enough to search out entertainers such as himself.
   ``I sing in 21 languages,'' he said. ``I have a wealth of
material and I mix it up with more modern tunes. I do some stuff
that Sting writes.''
   Bikel sings from musicals he has appeared in, such as ``Fiddler
on the Roof,' and also does songs from ``My Fair Lady'' and ``Three
Penny Opera.''
   Bikel, who has been nominated for an Academy Award, said the
number of film offers he has received in recent years has declined
because he lives in Connecticut.
   ``Hollywood is a strange place,'' he said. ``If you're not there
they think you are sick or dead. Every now and then I have to go
back and show my face to show that I'm neither.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Barbara Eden is joining the cast of
``Dallas'' as a business executive who takes Ewing Oil away from
J.R. Ewing.
   It's a bit of a role reversal for Eden and Larry Hagman, who
plays J.R. Twenty years ago, Hagman was ``Master'' and Eden took
the orders as ``Jeannie'' in the sitcom ``I Dream of Jeannie.''
This time Eden becomes J.R.'s boss.
   ``My character does end up buying Ewing Oil and J.R. hates it.
Of course, he wants to still be in there, so I hire him back,''
Eden said in the Nov. 13 issue of Soap Opera Digest.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Vanna White is marketing a
look-alike doll on cable TV and women's clothes that will allow
viewers to coordinate their outfits with those of the dolls.
   The Home Shopping Network said Tuesday that the Wheel of Fortune
letter-turner's line of fashions also includes designer sheets. The
merchandise is only available through cable TV.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Ferlin Husky was greeted by fellow
country performers after his second heart bypass operation in 13
years.
   Brenda Lee, Chet Atkins, Johnny Russell, Jean Shepard, Skeeter
Davis, Jack Greene, Bill Anderson, Connie Smith and others were on
hand Tuesday when the 63-year-old singer left Baptist Hospital.
   ``I'm almost speechless,'' Husky said. ``I feel better all
over.''
   Husky, known for such hits as ``Wings of a Dove,'' had triple
bypass surgery Oct. 19. He also had similar surgery in 1977.
   At the height of his career in the 1960s, he made 18 movies with
such stars as Jayne Mansfield and Zsa Zsa Gabor.

   TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) - Political humorist James Boren, who ran
for president in 1984 on the slogan ``I've got what it takes to
take what you've got,'' will teach a political science course at
Northeastern State University.
   Boren, cousin of Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., will begin teaching
``Interest Groups in American Politics'' in January.
   Lyle Haskins, head of the school's political science department,
said if Boren stays at Northeastern beyond the year, he will be
asked to develop a course on the role of humor in international
relations and politics.
   ``That's right up his alley,'' Haskins said.
   Boren, 64, has a doctorate from the University of Texas, a
master's from the University of Southern California and two
bachelor's degrees, all in government and economics.

<HEAD>Congress Seeks Safer Garage Doors, Cigarette Lighters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress wants electric garage doors to
reverse automatically and cigarette lighters to be childproof,
mining in Antarctica to be prohibited and food-hauling trucks to be
barred from shipping hazardous trash.
   These mandates and more are among scores of bills approved and
sent to President Bush in the final days of the 101st Congress
while headlines concentrated on the budget legislation.
   Garage doors and cigarette lighters are governed by the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, which Congress strengthened in its first
reauthorization of the agency in nine years.
   ``This important consumer protection agency was an abandoned
stepchild during the Reagan years,'' said Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa.,
chairman of the House subcommittee on consumer protection.
``Ideological conflict among the members of the commission
paralyzed the agency.''
   Besides taking steps to make the commission work better,
Congress ordered it to establish mandatory safety standards for
automatic garage doors and to complete its work on cigarette
lighters.
   Although many of the newer garage doors automatically reverse
when they hit an obstruction, the safety provision is not required.
More than 50 children have been killed in accidents involving
automatic doors, Walgren's office said.
   It also said that in 1987, fires started by children playing
with cigarette lighters killed 180 people, including 140 children
under age 5.
   ``This is a horrible toll that can and should be prevented with
an effective safety standard,'' said Walgren. ``I believe it is
imperative that the commission move quickly to complete this
important task.''
   Lawmakers also saw the possibility of a toll being taken in
Antarctica.
   The continent at the South Pole was established as a scientific
area in 1959 with a treaty signed by 35 countries. In 1988, the
nations agreed to regulate mining by requiring environmental
impacts to be considered first. But that pact didn't guarantee
preservation of the Antarctic.
   A bill passed last week bans any U.S. mineral development on the
frozen continent and asks the president to negotiate new
international treaties to ban all mining.
   ``Antarctica is the last, relatively untouched continent on the
planet, providing unparalleled research opportunities, and the
United States is in a position to exert international leadership to
permanently protect and conserve this last frontier,'' said Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass., sponsor of the bill.
   Oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, in testimony to Congress,
forecast possible global tragedy if Antarctica were open to
widespread mining.
   ``The Antarctic, with 90 percent of the ice of the world,
represents a formidable cold storage that stabilizes the climate of
the world,'' Cousteau said.
   A slight warming of the atmosphere could trigger melting that
would raise the level of the oceans to intolerable proportions, he
said.
   ``Coal mines would bring about coal dust on the surface of the
ice. Even a small quantity would change the reflective power of the
ic, would absorb more heat from the sun, would start some melting
of the ice,'' said Cousteau.
   Congress passed about 200 bills in its final week. Some involved
internal government operations, while others addressed regional
issues.
   Some took hours of debate and were voted by roll call; others
were passed in minutes on voice vote with little discussion.
   Two bills designed to protect the public from hazardous
materials are on the way to the president.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, led the effort to prohibit the
``backhauling'' of waste by trucks that also are used to carry
food.
   He gave a graphic example of the danger of this practice. He
said that after feed grain was transported in a rail car that
earlier had hauled an arsenic compound, $1 million worth of cattle
died from eating the contaminated grain.
   ``Milk from other cattle was poisoned and had to be dumped for
over four weeks until it tested clean,'' Luken said.
   The legislation instructs the departments of Transportation,
Agriculture and Health and Human Services and the Environmental
Protection Agency to consult on regulations for transporters.
   No food cargo would be allowed in truck or rail cars that carry
health-threatening materials. Extremely hazardous materials, such
as asbestos or infectious waste, would have to be shipped only in
carriers specifically designed for that purpose.
   After eight years of trying, Luken also won approval of his bill
to strengthen the law governing the transportation of hazardous
material. It makes civil and criminal penalties harsher, requires
greater safety precautions, unifies federal, state and local laws
and sets up training on responding to emergencies.
   Luken said that last year there were more than 6,000 accidents
involving hazardous materials, and that more than 165 people were
injured and 17 were killed. The accidents caused damages of more
than $21 million, he said.

   News and photo coverage of the dramatic changes in
Eastern Europe earned recognition for two of the seven Associated
Press staff members honored with Top Performance awards by the
Associated Press Managing Editors association.
   Special Correspondent Mort Rosenblum was honored for his
coverage of the Romanian revolution of December 1989. Photographer
Diether Endlicher of Munich, Germany, was cited for two photographs
of East Germans who fled to the West German Embassy in Prague.
   The Top Performance awards, given Tuesday, recognize outstanding
work over the past year in three reporting categories - writing on
deadline, feature writing and enterprise writing - and in spot news
photography and feature photography.
   Other winners were:
   -Special Correspondent Tad Bartimus of Denver, chosen for
``Goodbye Daddy'' a recounting of the final days of her terminally
ill father's life. Bartimus is the AP's Mountain States regional
reporter.
   -National Writer Fred Bayles of Boston, Sharon Cohen of Chicago
and Scott McCartney of Dallas, for their four-part series,
``Cashing in on the Drought,'' that tracked the allcation of $3.9
billion, the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history. Cohen
is the news service's regional reporter for the Midwest, and
McCartney is the regional reporter for the Southwest.
   -Jim Mone of Minneapolis, for a post-surgery photo of former
President Reagan doffing a cap to expose a half-shaved head, while
Nancy Reagan tried to cover him up.
   The winners were awarded $1,500 and a plaque at the APME
convention here.
   The organization also named Connie Cass, the AP's Evansville,
Ind., correspondent, as winner of the 10th annual John L. Dougherty
award for excellence by a young AP writer.
   The award is named for a former APME leader and managing editor
of the Rochester, N.Y., newspapers who had an abiding interest in
good writing and helped young writers improve their skills. He died
in 1980. Cass received a $1,000 cash award and a plaque.
   Additional awards for excellence in the Top Performance
reporting competition went to:
   -Linda Deutsch of Los Angeles for her coverage of the trial of
former Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood and its aftermath;

   With voters in an anti-government snit, many
candidates are trying hard to show their warm, fuzzy sides in the
final week of the election season.
   Children, music, personal drama and high-minded sentiments
generally make a comeback at the end of any political campaign. But
strategists say the soft landing is especially important this year.
   ``The level of disgust is much higher,'' said Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake. ``You need to offer an alternative, be seen
as someone who doesn't seem political and will cut through all of
this mess.''
   That's not to say hard-hitting advertising and attacks have
vanished. Many strategists believe long-shot challengers and
candidates in tight races must keep up the barrage if they want to
win.
   Republican pollster David B. Hill agreed that candidates need to
clinch the sale with niceness at the end of the season. But, he
said, ``that doesn't mean you need to pull off your other spots
that keep your foot on the throat of your opponent that you've got
down on the ground.''
   Nevertheless, consultants acknowledge that negative advertising
carries greater risks this year as a result of widespread voter
frustration with politicians-as-usual.
   ``We've always known that when you do negative campaigning you
raise your own negative ratings and make yourself look more
political,'' Lake said. ``That's a more dangerous trend this year
than normal.''
   Thus, the special emphasis on touchy-feely ads and rhetoric such
as this:
   -It's a warm, sunny day in a new ad from Lowell Weicker, the
independent candidate for Connecticut governor. A choir sings and
Weicker tells viewers that ``the governor's office is about
leadership, vision, integrity.'' He explained his strategy last
week: ``I want to become the governor of the state of Connecticut
feeling good about how I got to be the governor of the state of
Connecticut.''
   -In neighboring Massachusetts, Democrat John Silber alienated
many voters with his abrasive personality. Now he's running an ad
in which he strolls amiably through a flea market. In another spot,
he's surrounded by young children, joking with a little girl as she
combs his hair.
   -In Rhode Island, an ad for Rep. Claudine Schneider praises both
her and the man whose job she wants, Democratic Sen. Claiborne
Pell, as ``proven, caring, committed and honest.'' It's hard to
tell who paid for the spot until the end, when the 71-year-old
Pell's picture recedes behind a photo of the relatively youthful
Schneider. ``Two of a kind,'' the announcer says. ``One with a
past, and the other ready to meet the future.''
   -California Democrat Dianne Feinstein reintroduced a dramatic ad
that helped her win the party's gubernatorial nomination. Feinstein
is shown announcing the traumatic 1978 murder of San Francisco
Mayor George Moscone - an event that put her, then president of the
city's board of supervisors, into the mayor's chair. The ad
highlights her support for the death penalty and abortion rights,
and describes her as ``tough and caring.''
   -Ben Nelson, the Democrat challenging Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr,
last week pulled all ads that criticized Mrs. Orr or mentioned her
name. ``The people in Nebraska think all of that stuff is
negative,'' he said.
   -Oregon Republican Dave Frohnmayer, running for governor, and
Colorado Democrat Josie Heath, running for the Senate, each have
switched advertising consultants and strategies. They're both
striving for more positive images.
   Republican analyst Doug Bailey warns that too much rosiness can
backfire.
   ``Television is so slam-bang. It's all confrontation and
slugfest and battle royal,'' he said. ``If you come across as soft
or dull, you can be missed altogether.''
   But Dave Petts, a Democratic pollster, said strategists were
rediscovering the power of positive advertising - particularly when
it's used as a finale after weeks of aggressive crossfire.
   ``There's nothing more effective than a candidate looking at the
voters and saying this is what he or she stands for,'' Petts said.
``Positive information can move voters if it's conveyed at a time
in the campaign when voters are really paying attention.''

   Turn to page 225 of the 13th edition of ``The
Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' to learn how to truss a chicken, page 628
to bake a batch of brownies. Or just soak in the spirit of the
book, which is only partly about food.
   It also is about ``an act of giving and receiving, because the
experience at table is a communal sharing; talk begins to flow,
feelings are expressed, and a sense of well-being takes over,''
Marion Cunningham writes in the 13th edition of Fannie Merritt
Farmer's guide to the American kitchen.
   A valuable cookbook also reflects its time, and the previous
edition - Cunningham's first, published 11 years ago - already was
losing its relevancy when she set out three years ago on the new
edition.
   ``I tell you, things are different, really different. It was
only looking recipe by recipe that I could see how dramatic our
changes have been,'' she said in an interview in New York.
   Testing every recipe in the 12th edition, Cunningham dropped 200
and added 325, for an appropriate total of 1,990. Fat was reduced
when it worked, and recipes sometimes dropped when it didn't.
There's no kippered herring in cream or crabmeat terrapin, for
example.
   There are new chapters on microwave cooking (which surely won't
prompt any manufacturers to ask her to be a spokeswoman), outdoor
cooking and vegetarian foods, such as zucchini pancakes and a
winter vegetable cobbler that ``will win any contest.''
   All sorts of ethnic ingredients are used. Raw fish is out, as is
steak tartare. Salt generally is left up to the cook. And there are
warnings about raw eggs and fish and other safety problems.
   ``Those were the issues that were very hard to reconcile,''
Cunningham said. ``To act responsibly and not destroy the feeling
that cooking and eating are ... well, certainly one of the better
human endeavors.''
   While Farmer aimed ``The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book,''
published in 1896, at families who had help in the kitchen, the
newest edition of ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' (Alfred A. Knopf,
$24.95) is intended to capture the way ordinary people actually
eat.
   So along with the instructions for making past from scratch are
recipes for a ham and cheese sandwich, for making popcorn, hotdogs
and macaroni and cheese. Cunningham tells how to improve the flavor
of canned broths, and offers suggestions for leftovers. ``Everyone
clamors'' for the simple cheese spread in the appetizer chapter,
she writes.
   There is plenty of practical advice, too. Of olive oils, for
example, she says, ``Money does not always buy the best, and I have
found the terms `virgin' and `extra virgin' not very meaningful.''
   Both inside covers have all sorts of nifty facts - things you've
been told dozens of times but can't seem to keep straight, such as
how to tell if an egg is stale and whether cream whips better cold
or at room temperature.
   Farmer would, Cunningham concluded, wholeheartedly embrace
today's health movement. Cunningham, too, thinks we ought to know
what we eat.
   ``But in concentrating so much on the negative aspects of
eating, we are making ourselves overly fearful and we are missing
the pleasure that a good meal provides,'' she writes. ``Instead of
stringent diets, eliminating almost all fats, all salt, all sugar
from our diets, and bloating ourselves with high-fiber products, I
believe that the best possible approach for the average person is
to eat a wide variety of foods and to eat sensibly, in
moderation.''
   While there is plenty of low-fat food, this is no diet book.
   Along with the turkey patties and vegetable soups and green
salads, there is a ``carpetbag steak,'' a beef and oyster dish from
the ``improvident days'' of the 19th century, and chicken fried
steak served with milk gravy.
   Cunningham delivers a storehouse of basic information - and a
pep talk. Come on, now, just get up and go in the kitchen. Taste
the food, experiment. It's fun, it's homey and it tastes good.
Don't let your failures stop you.
   ``Cooking is a dandy way to solve a lot of problems,'' said
Cunningham. Besides, she said, ``It's harder to learn to drive a
car.''
   Cunningham, 68, began the 12th edition of Fannie Farmer in 1974,
with no writing experience and no famous name. She had been a
full-time homemaker, and two years earlier had met the late
American cooking icon James Beard.
   ``Jim Beard recommended me. I didn't think I had any
qualifications,'' said Cunningham, sitting on a hotel bed with her
legs drawn up under her, gray hair pulled straight back into a
short, neat ponytail.
   The choice made sense to Judith Jones, Cunningham's editor at
Knopf.
   ``For one thing, she had worked with Beard and his classes on
the West Coast. He thought she really typified the good home cook
in America and had natural good taste, and that's just what Fannie
Farmer needed,'' Jones said.
   Cunningham was charged with ``restoring the old-fashioned
principles.''
   ``It made me so happy to have something to focus on. I've really
loved it,'' she said. ``I loved it from the beginning.''
   Her pale blue eyes still express a little awe at her success
more than a decade later, during which she also has written ``The
Fannie Farmer Baking Book'' and ``The Breakfast Book'' and worked
as a restaurant consultant.
   Her husband, a man she'd known since kindergarten and who she
says gave her the support and encouragement to become a
professional, died three years ago. Their son and daughter are
grown. So except for a yellow labrador named Rover and a cat, she
lives alone and cooks for herself in Walnut Creek, Calif.
   Besides Beard, she uses ``Joy of Cooking'' and the early
American cookbooks she collects: ``I turn to a lot of them,
wonderful recipes, simple to make.''
   Like three-quarters of American families, she has a microwave.
The ``speedy, clean and silent'' oven did not fare well under
Cunningham's scrutiny, although she includes more than 50 recipes
specifically for it.
   ``The microwave has promised a lot more than it can deliver,''
she said.
   It was, she wrote, no faster than the stove for many of the
vegetables she tested. Meat becomes ``pallid and the texture is not
appealing.''
   While Cunningham experimented with the new in equipment and
ingredients, sometimes she found the old to be far superior.
   Lobster thermidor and newburg, for example, did not work with
milk instead of cream, and with cream they stayed.
   ``People can read about them if they don't want to make them,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Freddy Krueger hates Halloween.
   In fact, Oct. 31 is a nightmare for five Fred Kruegers who live
in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois.
   It's particularly tough for the Fred Krueger who lives in
Tobyhanna, Pa. His house is two blocks from Elm Street.
   No kidding. Fred Kruegers, men with the same name as the star of
screen, scream and gore, are alive and well but unenthusiastic
about the holiday that is descended from the medieval All Hallows
Eve.
   The prank calls and weird stares, they say, will be relentless.
   None of the Freds is maimed by scars, has pop-out claws or even
dons a fedora. None has been accused of even one grisly murder,
unlike the prolific maniac featured in the never-ending movie saga,
``A Nightmare on Elm Street.'' But these disparities do not ward
off pranksters.
   ``I got some regular customers on the phone,'' said Fred Krueger
who lives in Olivers Mills, Pa., and works for Liberty Mutual Life
Insurance Co.
   ``It's best to go along with them,'' he said, noting that kids
will just harass him if he sounds mad or hangs up.
   Fred Krueger, a retired banker from Charlotte, N.C., also plays
the demonic role but said he tries to keep it simple because he
once scared a little girl.
   ``She wanted to know iicopters
to make sure no herds wander into their ranges. They also patrol
the ranges in trucks before the shells start flying over the
tortured landscape.
   ``It may look like crap to us, but it's Kentucky blue grass to
them,'' said Lt. Col. Bruce Judge, a Marine operations and training
officer.
   ``Safety is a paramount concern,'' said Marine Capt. William
Taylor, a public affairs officer. ``It's like going into a farmer's
field and telling him we'd like to bust some big caps in your
backyard.''
   The clash of cultures is stark.
   A Bedouin tending his bleating livestock can see helicopters
flitting through the skies, armored columns rumbling across the
terrain and endless convoys of military trucks on the roads.
   On one night recently, a patrol of three Marine amphibious
assault vehicles passed within 25 yards of a Bedouin camp deep in
the desert. Goats were visible through night vision goggles, but
the soldiers said they never saw the camp.
   Another night patrol picked up movement on its sensors but
couldn't hear anything. It turned out to be a herd of 20 camels
passing by.
   Bedouin require lots of space to roam. Yet they say they welcome
the troops in the desert.
   ``I thank God the government is having people come to defend the
kingdom,'' Al-Azmi said, giving a visitor Arabic coffee, sweet tea
and fresh dates while sitting on a rug in the shade of a tent flap.
   ``Saddam Hussein should be punished. He attacked people who did
him no harm. God will punish him,'' he said.
   Although the Bedouin life is rustic, some have the luxuries of
modern life such as Mercedes Benz cars and cellular telephones. A
camel can fetch $2,500 at auction, and that's a lot to lose to an
errant artillery shell or a tank.
   On the advice of Saudi authorities, another Bedouin named
Abdullah Rajab prepared his herd of 70 camels for a journey south
and out of harm's way.
   ``Some of the troops came and drank tea with me. They were very
nice,'' Rajab said.
   As he spoke, dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers from
the British 7th ``Desert Rats'' Armored Brigade shook the ground as
they rumbled past his livestock.
   Their tracks scarred a desert once trodden only by animals and
herders.
   But the military also does good deeds in the desert. When Hassan
Rashed Alkhater of Jubail, the eastern Saudi industrial city, got
his pickup truck stuck in the sand, an army vehicle stopped to
help.
   ``I was waiting for 30 minutes for someone to help, and a
passing army vehicle pulled me out,'' said Alkhater, who owns 150
head of sheep and goats.

   Kidnappers dragged Hasson Saleem, 11,
from his schoolbus Oct. 10, forced him into a car and sped away.
   Hours later, abductors seized three more boys from affluent
families of Sindh province and a former chairman of the Pakistan
National Shipping Corp.
   Kidnappings for ransom are increasing in Karachi, and the belief
grows that authorities are helpless against the lawlessness
gripping Pakistan's largest and most turbulent city.
   In the rambunctious southern port where parties once ran until
dawn, people are afraid to go out at night.
   More than 100 people have been snatched in two years. No one has
been killed, but more than 1 billion rupees ($500 million) in
ransom has been paid.
   The list of victims reads like a Who's Who of industrial and
financial families.
   ``We want a military government,'' an executive of a
multinational corporation said, echoing the sentiments of many
residents. ``We may not have law, but at least we'll have order. In
this democracy, we have neither law nor order.''
   Benazir Bhutto's political opponents blamed her for the violence
in her home province until President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed
her 20-month-old government Aug. 6. It was one of the factors he
cited in taking the action.
   Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, army chief of staff, then declared the
crime wave over and said peace had been restored.
   Kidnapping gangs soon proved him wrong, abducting people at the
rate of one a day.
   Businessmen held protest strikes that paralyzed Karachi, the
country's financial and industrial center, but nothing changed.
   The gangs ``have lists of top businessmen and their family
members,'' a security agent said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Once they have selected their target, a reconnaissance
team is deployed to gather the necessary information about their
daily movement, and then they strike.''
   Gamg members then get in touch with the victim's family, a deal
is struck and the ransom paid.
   Families seldom request official help because they lack faith in
the police and fear for the victims' safety.
   ``We can't trust police because most of the crimes are committed
with their connivance,'' said a businessman whose younger brother
was kidnapped.
   Police say lack of cooperation by victims' families and the
public is a major reason for their failure to stop the kidnappers.
They also claim the gangs enjoy the patronage of some political
parties.
   Authorities accuse such extremist ethnic parties of involvement
in many of the abductions. Students hostels in Karachi are said to
be hideouts for the gangs.
   ``Apart from political patronage, feudal patronage is also a
factor,'' the security expert said. ``Most gangs enjoy the support
of the big landlords who wield political influence. Because of
these factors, the governments in Sindh have almost become hostage
to the criminals.''
   Karachi's economy has suffered. Businesses and investors are
moving their operations from the financial and trading center of 9
million people to safer Punjab province in eastern Pakistan.
   ``I don't know what will happen to me when I leave my home,''
industrialist Tariq Shafi said. ``I keep an automatic gun in my
car. In this situation, how do you expect us to invest in the
city?.''
   The flight of capital has boosted unemployment, already about 25
percent, and fed the ``Kalashnikov and heroin culture,'' a
reference to the Soviet automatic rifles and heroin trade brought
to Pakistan by the war in neighboring Afghanistan.
   Companies that specialize in protection are thriving.
   Two years ago, the Adamjee Insurance Co. started offering kidnap
policies.
   ``Initially, we approached the leading businessmen . . . but now
they are coming to us,'' an Adamjee executive said, on condition
his name not be used.
   Adamjee works with Lloyd's of London. When a client is
kidnapped, experts from Britain are flown to help negotiate the
ransom.
   Businessmen are abandoning expensive luxury cars for less
conspicuous compacts, hiring bodyguards and building huge steel
gates to close off the streets around their fortified estates.
   Each week, the heads of the 22 most powerful industrial empires
gather in downtown Karachi.
   ``When these meetings started 15 years ago, the discussions were
about business, politics, culture,'' an executive said. ``Now the
only topic is our and our families' safety.''

   For a kid growing up in the post-World War II
suburbs, it was a comforting world of Captain Kangaroo on the tube,
a new washing machine in the basement, a shiny gas guzzler in the
carport and a bomb shelter in the backyard.
   ``This is our childhood,'' said Roger G. Kennedy, director of
the National Museum of American History, where he introduced a new
exhibition that takes a nostalgic look at the lives of children
born during the Cold War years.
   Kennedy meant not only the childhood of the current baby boom
generation of parents but, in a deeper sense, the innocence of a
nation that yearned only for peace and the emblems of middle-class
prosperity.
   The show, titled ``This is Your Childhood Charlie Brown:
Children and American Culture, 1945-1968,'' opens today at the
Smithsonian Institution museum for a six-month engagement through
next April.
   It contains more than 500 artifacts and graphics from an America
that would soon lose its innocence in Vietnam and the social
upheavals of the late 1960s.
   Among them is Charles M. Schulz's first ``Peanuts'' comic strip,
which appeared Oct. 2, 1950. Perhaps more than any other cartoon
characters of that era, Charlie Brown and his friends mirrored the
hopes and fears of postwar America with a gentle, captivating
humor.
   In an age when children were taught to live by society's rules
and obey their parents, their TV heroes frequently wore uniforms.
Even Bob Keeshan's Captain Kangaroo wore a uniform jacket with
badge as a ``figure of benevolent authority.''
   It was the world according to Dr. Spock, whose lab coat and
spectacles are on display along with the drafting table where he
wrote his best-selling paperback, ``Baby and Child Care,'' for a
generation of worried mothers.
   Parents worried, too, about communism and nuclear attack. Their
children's toys included a Gilbert U-238 atomic lab and Civil
Defense medical kit among the hula hoops, Barbie dolls, GI Joes,
Lassie lunch boxes and Davy Crockett coonskin caps.
   Also on display are such postwar images as a model of the
Sputnik satellite, a space helmet, Dale Evans and Nurse Nancy
books, a pink chenille bedspread, a Captain Video game, an Annie
Oakley cowgirl outfit, a ``Ding Dong School'' record player and
``Romper Room'' diploma and an Easy-Bake toy oven.
   Curator Charles McGovern, a historian of popular culture, said
the exhibition seeks to highlight some of the myths and realities
of what is remembered today as ``a very calm and tranquil era.''
   Actually, he said, ``happy suburbanites and the threat of
nuclear war lived side by side'' along with growing urban poverty
and racial divisions that erupted into social conflicts in the
1960s.
   Kennedy said ``the whole fabric of American society began a long
unraveling.''
   Parents tried to shield their children from society's problems
with barriers of ``security and conformity,'' McGovern said, but
the children rebelled against parental values when they discovered
that ``affluence was not translating fully into happiness'' and
social justice.
   The show ends by raising questions about whether parents can
protect their children from new threats of drug abuse, violence,
AIDS and homelessness. ``Childhood today is at risk,'' suggests
McGovern.
   The exhibition was underwritten by a $125,000 grant from United
Media, which syndicates the ``Peanuts'' comic strip.

   Eugene Roberts, former executive editor of
The Philadelphia Inquirer, Tuesday said he had no evidence that
Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice James McDermott was corrupt,
either before or after the newspaper published a 1983 series
critical of the state's highest court.
   McDermott has sued the Inquirer claiming he was maliciously
defamed and his reputation damaged because of the articles, which
were published May 17, 1983 and titled ``Above the Law.'' Roberts
is listed as a defendant in the case.
   The series, subtitled ``the questionable conduct of the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court,'' alleged that the justices ``routinely
participate in cases in which their friends have an interest ...
ignore judicial canons of ethics meant to regulate their conduct
(and) engage in politicking, influence-peddling and favoritism.''
   McDermott's lawyer, James Beasley, asked Roberts if any evidence
has appeared since series was published that would indicate
McDermott was corrupt.
   Roberts answered, ``No.''
   Beasley asked how the series title came about, and Roberts told
him ``Above the Law'' was probably composed by a copy editor
handling the series written by Daniel Biddle, also a defendant in
the lawsuit.
   ``Is it a reasonable synopsis of what the story was about?''
Beasley asked. Roberts responded, ``Yes.''
   Beasley pressed on: ``Do you believe the title could connote
criminal conduct?''
   ``No,'' said Roberts.
   Most of the day's proceedings involved legal conferences out of
the jury's hearing by the opposing lawyers with Common Pleas Judge
John Lavelle of Carbon County, specially appointed by the Supreme
Court to try the case.
   Roberts, who was scheduled to return to the witness stand
Wednesday, acknowledged that one of the objectives of journalism is
to write a story that is fair, balanced and accurate.
   ``That's because you want the people to believe what you print
is true?'' Beasley asked.
   ``That's one of the reasons,'' Roberts replied, adding that
readers have a right to a balanced story that gives different
points of view and is accurate.
   Roberts three years ago was named president of Philadelphia
Newspapers Inc. which publishes the morning Inquirer and the
afternoon Daily News. He retired last month and plans to teach next
year at the University of Maryland.
   He testified that as the Inquirer's executive editor, a post he
held for 18 years, he could kill any story he didn't want in the
newspaper, and never needed anyone's permission to do it.
   ``That's enormous power,'' Beasley said, and Roberts agreed.
   About the court series, Roberts testified he didn't select the
language that went into the story or how paragraphs were
positioned, nor does he remember doing any editing of it.
   Beasley asked, ``Do you have any evidence that prior to May 1983
that Justice McDermott ruled on any case in favor of a friend or
campaign contributor while he served for 15 years on the Common
Pleas bench?''
   ``I don't recall the Common Pleas bench (but) I know he ruled in
a case for a friend and campaign contributor (when he was on the
Supreme Court),'' Roberts responded.

<TEXT>
   The solid United Nations front forged to
squeeze Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait has evolved during the
three-month occupation into an alliance divided over strategy and
goals.
   The wild card is Saddam himself, who is selectively freeing some
Western hostages - like the French - in hopes of eroding support
for military action. He has tried to fashion a regional perception
that the struggle is not over Kuwait, but whether Arabs or the West
will hold sway in the Middle East.
   Saddam's neighbor, Saudi Arabia, exemplifies the conflicts
within the alliance assembled against Iraq.
   The Saudis demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and want Saddam
to promise never to attack another Arab state. At the same time,
there have been indications the Saudis might consider concessions
of Kuwaiti territory.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev suggested Monday the time
was ripe for another Arab diplomatic initiative, perhaps led by
Saudi Arabia.
   With the Saudi oil installations vulnerable to attack, the
country's defense minister, Prince Sultan, has said his country -
now playing host to the multinational force - would never allow an
attack to be launched from its territory.
   However, King Fahd's son, Prince Mohammed, was quoted as saying
``the waiting period for ending Iraq's occupation of Kuwait through
the embargo will be soon defined because patience has limits.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to visit Saudi
Arabia and possibly other Arab capitals next month in an apparent
effort to shore up the alliance against Saddam.
   Some analysts say the differing approaches of the nations
opposed to Saddam actually complement each other, preparing the
military punch while pursuing the diplomatic option.
   ``That range of difference in the multinational group is a
positive thing,'' said Middle East analyst Shahram Chubin of the
Geneva-based Center for Strategic Studies.
   ``If you want the regional coalition behind you, you have to
show that you've given the U.N. option a chance,'' he said by
telephone.
   ``There's a great and deep ambivalence on the part of the United
States' regional (Arab) allies about the whole enterprise,'' he
said. ``There's a lot of anti-Western feelings and there's a
feeling of solidarity with their cousins in Iraq.''
   The linchpin position is held by the United States, which has
deployed 220,000 troops in the Persian Gulf. President Bush has
demanded Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from the oil-rich emirate
it invaded Aug. 2, as well as restoration of the ruling al-Sabah
family.
   Bush has repeatedly stressed the military option, and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has said as many as 100,000 more GIs could be
deployed if needed. CIA Director William Webster said the Bush
administration believes the Middle East will not be secure while
Saddam's weaponry is intact.
   The Persian Gulf crisis is filled with political traps for Bush.
Large-scale casualties would be a liability, while a diplomatic
solution that left Saddam's war machine in place would sow the
seeds for a reprise of the present conflict.
   ``We're into a perilous phase in the standoff if the goal of the
allied forces is more than what the U.N. resolution calls for - to
destroy Saddam and his ability to make war,'' said a Middle East
expert with the U.S. State Department.
   ``Then, no matter what amount of diplomacy is engaged, there's
no way to avoid shooting. Most of the European allies would not
necessarily support that, with the exception of Britain,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``I don't think you can get the French to agree that the goal is
now to destroy Saddam,'' the State Department expert said. ``I
don't think the Arab states can send their troops into battle for
that purpose.''
   The United States has the most troops in the multinational
force, followed by Britain and France.
   Britain stands squarely behind Bush on the use of force against
Saddam, but France and the Soviet Union have rejected any military
action without express United Nations approval.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been most outspoken
about military action. ``You get him out, make him pay and see that
he's never in a position to do these things again,'' she has said.
   France, which favors waiting for economic sanctions to force
Iraq out of Kuwait, was Iraq's closest Western economic partner
before the invasion. Although Iraq apparently tried to woo France
by freeing French hostages, President Francois Mitterrand has
rejected any concessions in exchange for hostages.
   This week, Yevgeny Primakov, Gorbachev's gulf envoy, completed a
second round of talks with Saddam - discussions that reportedly
were largely unsuccessful.
   Analyst Chubin said: ``The Soviets are doing a fine job,
demonstrating that a diplomatic solution is not possible.''

   Mohammed Miari, an Israeli Arab, and Michael
Eitan, a Jew, are two members of Parliament whose quarrel goes to
the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Miari, from an Arab village in northern Israel, was involved
with the Palestine Liberation Organization in a futile attempt to
sail a shipload of Palestinians back to their homeland in February
1988.
   Eitan, a Jew, saw it as an act of treason designed to turn
Israel into Palestine and undermine the Jews' right to the land. He
went on a 36-day sit-down strike in the attorney general's office
to get him to prosecute Miari.
   The attorney general, Yosef Harish, finally agreed to ask the
Knesset, or parliament, to lift Miari's parliamentary immunity so
that he could be prosecuted.
   On Monday, a parliamentary committee agreed to the unprecedented
step by a vote of 13-6 with two abstentions.
   The move stands a good chance of winning final approval by the
120-member Knesset next month, and an equally good chance of being
declared unlawful by the Supreme Court, because the whole point of
immunity is to enable a lawmaker to fulfill his election promises.
   ``My immunity is not given me by legislators but by the masses
who elected me for my message of seeking peace and a just solution
by establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel,'' Miari said
after the vote.
   Miari is not accused of abetting terrorism, and a 1986 law
forbidding contact between Israelis and PLO officials has been
openly violated by several Israeli lawmakers, including Miari.
   But to Israelis like Eitan, the case of the PLO ship is very
different.
   The ship was to carry 180 Palestinian deportees and some 120
sympathizers. Moreover, it was named ``Al Awda'' - the Return - an
evocative word meaning the Palestinians' right to reclaim the land
that became Israel in 1948.
   ``Al Awda is one of the basics of PLO doctrine,'' Eitan said in
an interview Tuesday. ``The PLO knows that talk of throwing the
Jews into the sea no longer goes down well, so they say `right of
return,' whereby all the Palestinians will come back to Israel and
then the Jews will have nowhere to go but into the sea.''
   The project failed because the ship owner canceled the charter
agreement, and the vessel was then sabotaged in an explosion. The
perpetrators are unknown, but Miari suspects Israeli secret agents.
   Miari says Eitan's fears are groundless.
   ``Yes, there are those who think in an abstract way that the
whole land belongs to the Palestinians, just as there are Jews who
think the whole of Palestine belongs to the Jews,'' he said in an
interview.
   He believes, based on a dozen meetings with Arafat and other top
PLO officials, that the PLO is set on a course of negotiations to
achieve ``two states for two nations.''
   Miari, 51, was born in the village of Birweh, near Acre in
northern Israel. In 1948 the Arab-Israeli war reached Birweh, and
the Miaris fled to a neighboring town. When they came home, the
village was in rubble.
   Miari studied law at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and was
always politically active. In 1984 he ran for the Knesset on the
ticket of the Progressive List for Peace - a left-wing Arab-Jewish
coalition advocating negotiations with the PLO - and was elected
along with Matti Peled, a retired Jewish army general.
   In 1988 he was re-elected, this time alone but still the third
strongest force among Israel's 800,000 Arab voters.
   At each election, authorities banned the party as a threat to
state security. Each time, the Supreme Court quashed the ban.
   Eitan, 46, sees the PLO as a movement bent on Israel's
destruction and Miari as one of its representatives in the Knesset.
   Until his party, the governing Likud bloc, ordered him to
desist, he would open each speech with the words, ``Mr. Speaker,
honored members of the Knesset, excluding PLO representatives
seated in this chamber....''
   He says he understands Miari's motives and respects his
integrity. ``But understanding and sympathy are only good as far as
my front yard. When understanding and sympathy means having to give
up the state of Israel, the only country I have, then it stops.''
   Every Independence Day, while Israeli Jews dance in celebration
of their statehood, Miari takes his wife and children to Birweh and
joins the rest of the villagers in paying respects to the place
they still call home.
   ``For 2,000 years the Jews remembered Jerusalem and the land,''
he says. ``So why should the Arabs forget after 40 years?''

   There are still more labor union members in New
York City than anywhere else, but whether it is still a ``union
town'' in the traditional sense is critical to the unions striking
the Daily News.
   Despite a steady decline in the power of non-municipal labor
unions over the past 30 years, the battle over the newspaper has
provided evidence of labor's continuing clout:
   - Many newsstand dealers said they were not selling the Daily
News because of threats from men who followed delivery trucks
around the city.
   - Two municipal unions barred a Daily News editor from covering
a news conference Monday at which the unions announced they were
breaking off contract talks with the city.
   - Union leaders announced plans for a boycott against Daily News
advertisers.
   - In an ad in the Daily News, a Manhattan car dealer said:
``Attention Union Members. Extra Deep Discount Savings. Just Show
Us Your Union Card.''
   But what, really, is a union town?
   Union leader Don Owen summed it up by telling of a day in his
childhood when his mother stopped him from crossing a picket line
in front of a store.
   ``She said, `We can't go in there.' She explained the whole
thing to me, and that was it - we didn't go until the strike was
over,'' he said.
   But today, ``people are not familiar with that scenario any
more. Everybody's just out for themselves,'' says Owen, now a vice
president of the Amalgamated Transit union.
   Union drivers struck Greyhound eight months ago, but riders are
still buying tickets and the buses roll with permanent nonunion
replacements. Eastern Airlines continues to operate in the second
year of a machinists strike.
   ``You give people half fare and they'll get on the damn plane if
they see a wing hanging off,'' Owen said.
   Esther Fuchs, a political science professor at Barnard College,
says that although unions remain part of the city's political
fabric, ``there are no union towns any more.''
   ``I would guess that the public is not going to be particularly
distressed that the Daily News is considered to be anti-union in
this particular dispute,'' she said.
   Theodore Kheel, adviser to the newspaper unions, conceded that,
unlike 40 years ago, crossing a picket line is no longer anathema.
   ``There is less support today for unions,'' Kheel said.
   The News said in Tuesday's editions that 45 of the 350 Newspaper
Guild members in its editorial department returned to work Monday.
Only nine of the paper's 10 unions are on strike; members of the
Typographical Union have continued working because they have
guaranteed lifetime jobs.
   But Kheel said the wounds inflicted by the Daily News on its
workers are so raw that old-fashioned union solidarity will make
the boycott work.
   ``One and a half million union people in the city, with an
average of three people per family - four and a half million people
with union connections - and there will be an impact,'' Kheel
asserted.
   He said the Reagan administration's crushing of the air traffic
controllers' strike in 1981 emboldened employers to take on unions.
   Today's unionists come less and less from the ranks of
blue-collar factory workers, labor militants who also happened to
be the core of the Daily News' 2.4 million daily circulation of
four decades ago.
   Since World War II, New York City has lost two-thirds of a
million factory jobs - more than Detroit had when it was the world
capital of car manufacturing. There still are a third of a million
manufacturing jobs in the city but they continued to bleed away.
   ``The areas of decline were heavily union and, except for the
public sector, the growth industries have been largely nonunion in
the 1980s,'' said Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional director of the
federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   ``The environment in which unions operate has changed,''
Ehrenhalt said. ``Both the economic environment and the political
and social environment. We've seen people ready to disregard
strikes, as in the case of the airlines. Unions have been on the
defensive.''
   In the United States, union membership is about 60 percent in
private employ and 40 percent public, opposite to the balance in
New York City, said Leo Troy, an economics professor at Rutgers
University.
   ``New York City is clearly still a union town, but now
predominantly public sector rather than private,'' Troy said.
``It's a union town because the politicians are in bed with the
unions.''

   An experimental treatment strengthened a foot
muscle in three muscular dystrophy patients, raising hopes of
countering the disabling weakness produced by the disease, a study
says.
   Scientists had injected about 8 million immature muscle cells
called myoblasts into the muscle that raises the big toe.
   The result in the first three patients treated is ``very
exciting news,'' said Peter Law of the University of
Tennessee-Memphis. Results are not yet available for eight later
patients, he said.
   Scientists hope the technique will let them overcome progressive
muscle weakness and wasting caused by Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
the most common and devastating childhood form of dystrophy.
   Duchenne, which strikes boys almost exclusively, usually appears
between ages 3 and 5. Progressive weakness forces most patients to
use wheelchairs by age 12, and few survive beyond their early 20s.
   The disease, caused by a defective gene, strikes once in every
3,500 male births.
   Law discussed his results in a telephone interview before
participating in a news conference Tuesday at the annual meeting of
the Society for Neuroscience in St. Louis.
   He cautioned that the experimental treatment needs more study
before it could be considered for general use.
   Dr. Leon Charash, chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association's medical advisory committee, called the result ``a
very important preliminary finding.''
   It is the first report of increased strength from the technique,
and ``that's of course what we've all been waiting for,'' he said.
   But Charash stressed that the result must be duplicated in
larger muscles and that scientists must find out whether the
improvement will endure.
   His association helped pay for the research.
   Researchers in part chose the foot muscle in case anything went
wrong and the muscle had to be removed, Law said.
   Animal studies suggest that some injected myoblasts merge to
form new, healthy muscle fibers, while others fuse to the patient's
ailing muscle cells and introduce a full complement of genes. That
stops muscle degeneration by replacing the defective gene that
causes Duchenne dystrophy, Law said.
   Myoblasts for the first boy injected were taken from his
adoptive father, while the two other boys received myoblasts from
their brothers. The three boys took the drug cyclosporine to keep
their bodies from rejecting the myoblasts.
   Three months after injection, the treated muscles in the three
boys had strengthened by 18 percent, just over 30 percent and about
80 percent, Law said. The 80 percent gain probably reflects the
fact that this boy was weakest to begin with, Law said.
   Cyclosporine was stopped three months after injection. At six
months after injection, the muscles showed some additional gain in
strength, Law said.
   ``The muscle function continues to improve, indicating that the
cells are not dying, are not being rejected. So this is very
important,'' he said.
   The eight other patients in the study are continuing on
cyclosporine as researchers look for strength improvements six and
nine months after injection, he said.
   No patient has shown side effects from the treatment, Law said.
   In perhaps three months, Law said, he hopes to start another
study in which about 1 billion myoblasts would be injected into
major leg muscles. If that is effective, it might help patients
walk, he said.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is
investigating whether one of its undercover couriers may have
unknowingly carried the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland.
   The December 1988 bombing, which killed 270 people aboard the
plane and in the village of Lockerbie, has been attributed by law
enforcement authorities to a pro-Iranian terrorist group.
   Investigators said the terrorist group put plastic explosive in
a tape recorder in baggage that was shipped from Frankfurt,
Germany.
   NBC News, which first reported the new DEA investigation Tuesday
night, said it had learned that Pan Am's flights from Frankfurt had
been used in a Cyprus-based undercover operation to fly informants
and suitcases of heroin from the Middle East to Detroit.
   Nazir Khalid Jafaar, 20, of Detroit, was killed in the bombing.
The network said part of the drug agency review was to determine
whether he had been enlisted in the drug operation and whether he
had been tricked into carrying the bomb.
   The drug agency and German authorities had arranged for Pan
American World Airways' baggage operation in Frankfurt to be used
to put suitcases of heroin on planes, apparently without the usual
security checks, NBC News said. It cited an unidentified ``airline
source.''
   In a statement late Tuesday, the DEA said it was aware of
``allegations made to the media'' that an agency operation was
involved in the bombing.
   ``Although no evidence has surfaced to substantiate such a
claim, we are conducting an inquiry into these allegations,
including a review of case files and DEA operations and activities
in the relevant time period,'' the statement said.
   Spokesman Frank Shults said the agency hoped to know where it
stands at about the end of this week.
   A presidential commission on air terrorism reported in May it
found no evidence of any involvement by the DEA with the bombing.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, said last November he had received
an insurance investigator's report that convinced him the Central
Intelligence Agency had been tipped an attack might be made on the
plane.
   The report, he asserted, contended that the CIA was ``covering
up a drug run'' between Frankfurt and New York - something the CIA
immediately characterized as ``ridiculous.''
   Pan Am subpoenaed documents from the DEA and five other agencies
in an effort to prove that security agencies had received warnings
about the bombings.
   The judge in the victims' lawsuit against the airline reviewed
documents produced by those agencies, but found no basis for
turning them over to Pan Am, said Steven Pounian, a lawyer
representing victim families in the case in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Pounian declined to comment on Tuesday's announcement by the
drug agency.
   Pamela Hanlon, spokeswoman for the airline in New York, also
declined to comment.
   The terrorist group, according to law enforcement agencies, was
retaliating for the accidental shooting down of an Iranian airliner
over the Persian Gulf the previous summer by a U.S. warship.

   Air may be free, but it will cost almost
everyone to make sure it's clean.
   The newly passed clean air bill, aimed at ridding the nation of
much of its atmospheric pollution over the next decade, is expected
to carry an eventual price tag of more than $22 billion a year to
the economy.
   And if you drive a car, use electricity or buy hair spray, you
will help pay the bill. Businesses from mortuaries to bakeries will
be affected and may pass on their costs to customers or reduce
their profits.
   President Bush is expected to sign the measure, which will usher
in new pollution control requirements on factories, refineries,
electric utilities and automakers.
   The estimates on how much the anti-pollution law will cost have
ranged widely. The White House puts the bill at $10 billion a year
by 1995 and anywhere from $22 billion to $25 billion a year by
2005. Some industry estimates have ranged at more than $60 billion
a year.
   ``Americans will see continued progress to improve the nation's
air quality. But they also will pay the price,'' said William Fay,
who headed industry's lobbying efforts against the bill. The
measure cleared Congress easily last weekend.
   The economy already spends an estimated $32 billion a year on
air pollution controls, the Environmental Protection Agency
estimates. Many in industry and government say that amount easily
could double.
   But environmentalists argue the industry figures are highly
inflated and even the more conservative government estimates may
not take into account future cost savings by the adoption of new
technologies and business ingenuity.
   ``History demonstrates that once a law is passed, people find a
less expensive way to comply with it,'' says Richard Ayres,
executive director of the Clean Air Coalition, the environmental
umbrella group that campaigned for a strong bill for more than a
year.
   When all of the new requirements are in place, the typical
household likely will pay less for the improved air quality than it
does for going to the movies, said Ayres. He cited a study that
estimated the cost at about $20 per household a month by the year
2005, less than what the typical family pays on movies, tobacco
products or alcoholic beverages.
   While the extent of the new costs may be hard to pin down, the
fact that cleaner air will be more expensive is certain.
   Automakers say new equipment to comply with tougher tailpipe
emission standards will add $500 or more to the price of a car and
make some vehicles difficult to engineer so they meet the new
requirements. Others put the added cost of a car at closer to $130
per vehicle, and note that is less than the cost of many popular
options such as a stereo radio.
   Gasoline prices also are expected to increase because refineries
will have to produce cleaner-burning fuel. The new gasoline blends,
which will be required in cities with the worst smog and account
for one-fourth of all the gasoline sold, may cost motorists several
pennies to a dime more a gallon.
   The cost of cutting acid rain pollutants from coal-burning power
plants will total $5 billion to $7 billion a year, with consumers
in Midwestern states absorbing most of that burden, the utility
industry says.
   ``We estimated it will cost us approximately $700 million a year
from 1995 to 2004'' to comply with the new acid rain control
measures, said Luke Feck, a spokesman for American Electric Power.
The utility holding company provides customers with electricity in
Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia.
   Feck said rates for AEP customers will go up an average 13 to 15
percent, but for some - such as those provided electricity from
Ohio Power, whose plants are among the dirtiest - the increase
could be as much as 30 percent.
   Most of the utilities with dirty plants will be forced to either
switch from high-sulfur coal to a more expensive fuel or install
``scrubbers'' that can cost $100 million apiece.
   New curbs on industrial emissions - both toxic chemicals and
smog-causing pollutants - will be costly to small businesses as
well as huge petrochemical plants, forcing higher prices on
everything from plastic toys to car repainting and dry-cleaning a
dress.
   Some consumer items - such as hair spray or deodorant - may
become more expensive because of new requirements phasing out not
only environmentally damaging chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, but
also some of their less damaging substitutes. Motorists will find
that automobile air conditioner coolants such as Freon, a CFC, will
no longer be available over the counter.

   Workmen tunneling under the English
Channel have created the first land link between Britain and the
Continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of
engineering and finance.
   TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the
``Chunnel'' said the historic linkup occurred at 8:25 p.m. Tuesday
when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to
their French colleagues.
   Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing
unification of Europe. It also fulfills a dream of Napoleon, who
wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer Britain.
   Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the
world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to
pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993.
   Eventually a train trip from Paris to London should take three
hours.
   Despite her countrymen's fears of losing their ancient moat
against Europe, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described
the breakthrough as ``a very exciting moment.''
   ``It is an example of what Europe is about,'' she said in
London. ``This is Europe in practice.''
   In London, the conservative Daily Express newspaper noted today
that Britons will be able to walk to France for the first time
since the Ice Age.
   ``This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect,
that Britain is no longer an island,'' a construction union
official in Calais said. Threading a spinning probe the width of a
garden hose through 100 yards of chalk under the Channel bears the
first tangible fruit in three years of drilling.
   Champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after French
drillers phoned news of the probe's arrival to their British
counterparts.
   Initial tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of
alignment. Technicians will be more certain Wednesday, but they
called the rough line-up ``exceptional.''
   The workers will now bore out a one-yard hole. Tunnelers are
expected to walk through and greet each other with handshakes in a
few weeks.
   The tunneling machine on the French side will then guide itself
by laser toward the British machine, ensuring perfect alignment.
   Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand will meet
mid-tunnel on Jan. 26.
   The linkup came on the maintenance tunnel, the smallest of three
tunnels being dug. The other two will handle rail traffic - freight
and special piggy-back trains that will carry passengers and cars.
   About 80 percent of all the drilling is now complete.
   Eight workers suffered injures, two seriously, about 90 minutes
after Tuesday's linkup when a tractor rolled over on them in a
service gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.
   Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been
seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French
side.
   The tunnel's cost has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4
billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion in case
of unforeseen cost overruns.
   The digging is accomplished by gargantuan boring machines that
bring to mind images from Japanese monster movies.
   Each resembles a gnawing worm, some three-stories high, with a
spinning drill of hundreds of blades. Mechanical legs slap together
the concrete tunnel lining in the wake of the advancing drill head.
   Whhen its work is done, the drilling machine on the French side
will be hauled out in pieces. The one on the British side will dig
a side passage, and be buried in cement. Officials say it is too
costly to extricate the machine.
   The tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of Folkestone,
England, the British terminus near Dover, and 10 miles northwest of
Sangatte, near Calais.
   The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting
for its total length of 31 miles.
   Militant workers on the French side are striking for more pay
and began a work slowdown Thursday, threatening to stall the
link-up. But it came off on schedule.
   Eurotunnel PLC announced Oct. 8 that it had reached an agreement
with its banks on $3.5 billion in new credit. More than 200 banks
are involved in financing the world's costliest tunnel.
   The three-hour Paris-to-London trip would be comparable to
flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half
the time of the present car-ferry journey.
   Officials estimate the tunnel trains may carry 28 million
passengers in the first year of operation. Eurotunnel doesn't
expect a profit until the end of the century.
   France hopes the project will revitalize depressed northern
regions. But many Britons fear an influx of continental ills
ranging from terrorists to rabid animals.
   Britain warned Napoleon not to try to build the tunnel; digging
was started subsequently in 1882 and 1974, but both efforts failed.

   It's autumn in the nation's capital, but
Fatima, a 32-year-old Kuwaiti educator, is still wearing the thin
cotton outfits she had when she wound up stranded in the United
States three months ago.
   She had left her husband and 16-year-old daughter at home so she
could attend a conference at the University of Connecticut in July,
shortly before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. She hasn't seen her
family since.
   Depressed and alone, Fatima spends her days trying to spread the
word about what is happening inside her country. At night, she
sleeps in a rented one-room apartment. She asked that her last name
not be used for fear that her family in Kuwait could be harmed.
   Fatima - and several dozen other Kuwaitis - work as volunteers
at the headquarters of Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a non-profit
group established to draw attention to Kuwait.
   The volunteers cling to each other as if they were family,
anxiously awaiting news from inside their country.
   The group is financed in part by the Kuwait government-in-exile.
It has hired the public relations firm of Hill &amp; Knowlton to help
publicize the country's plight.
   Kuwait's leaders are living in Saudi Arabia and its embassies
around the world are still functioning. Kuwait is financing its
projects and giving stipends to stranded citizens with money from
its overseas investments.
   ``We are undertaking a public education campaign trying to
explain what is happening to Kuwait, emphasizing the human
tragedy,'' said Dr. Hassan Al-Ebraheem, the group's president.
Al-Ebraheem, a professor at Kuwait University, was on vacation at
the time of the invasion.
   Al-Ebraheem said the group has received ``tremendous support''
from Americans. People in the Midwest seem to be particularly eager
to learn about Kuwait, he said.
   He was pleased that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
highlighted Kuwait's situation in a speech in Los Angeles this
week.
   ``It is a story of barbarism in its most crude and evil form,
the rape of Kuwait,'' Baker said. He gave details of Iraqi soldiers
shooting two Kuwaiti children.
   Citizens for a Free Kuwait has opened its main U.S. office in a
building several miles from the White House. The furnishings are
austere; few pictures are on the walls, and paper Kuwaiti flags
serve as decorations.
   For most of the volunteers, the office has become their home
away from home. All told, about 3,000 Kuwaitis are stranded in the
United States, roughly half of them students.
   While most of the volunteers are Kuwaiti citizens, some are
Americans, such as Stephanie McGehee, 37, of San Diego.
   McGehee worked in Kuwait for several years as a photographer and
was there when Iraq invaded. She wrote about her dramatic Aug. 17
escape from the country for The Associated Press.
   McGehee said her work for the Kuwaiti group ``takes up about 24
hours a day.''
   She and others arrange visits to college campuses, set up
seminars nd plan publicity events. The group has reached
supporters in many states in an effort to persuade local
governments to pass resolutions supporting Kuwait.
   The group has scheduled prayer vigils in the nation's capital,
Los Angeles and San Francisco on Friday.
   Al-Ebraheem said he and others hope for a peaceful solution to
the situation in Kuwait, but he added that military action might be
the only course.
   ``Nobody actually favors violence or bloodshed,'' he said. ``But
all diplomatic efforts have been shut out. The news is very
negative.''

<HEAD>Chiles and Daughter Hold Different Views on Abortion</HEAD>

   Lawton Chiles' daughter wept when he took a
pro-choice stand on abortion during a televised debate in the
Florida governor's race.
   ``I was watching my dad, being so proud of him,'' said Rhea
Chiles-MacKinnon. ``When he said he would veto any legislation that
would restrict abortion my heart fell. I was so overwhelmed I began
to cry.''
   That's because she's steadfast in her conviction that abortion
is murder. So is her husband, Alex.
   ``We can't rationalize it. We can't turn our cheek and look the
other way,'' said Chiles' adopted 24-year-old daughter. ``It's not
a spiritual issue. It's not a Catholic issue. It's not a matter of
personal choice. It's a human rights issue. Abortion is inhumane.''
   The Democratic candidate first broached the issue during a
primary debate in September when challenged for a stand by party
rival Bill Nelson. He beat Nelson handily and is in a neck-and-neck
race with Gov. Bob Martinez.
   During his 18 years in the U.S. Senate, Chiles supported
abortion only in the case of rape, incest or danger to the life of
the mother. He voted for a constitutional amendment to overturn the
U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Like pro-life candidate Martinez, he is personally opposed to
abotion. But Chiles says he would veto any attempt to change
Florida's abortion law because it would violate the state's
guaranteed right to privacy.
   A decision whether to obtain an abortion is ``uniquely personal
to each woman,'' Chiles says, and ``government should not interfere
with this personal right.''
   Martinez called a special session in 1989 in an unsuccessful bid
to restrict access to abortion and regulate abortion clinics.
   Mrs. Chiles-MacKinnon wrote to Martinez at the time, calling
abortion cruel and violent. ``I thanked him for standing up for
what's right, for standing on his convictions.''
   Her personal stand was known long before abortion became an
issue in the governor's race. An article she wrote explaining her
opposition was published in The Tampa Tribune in May, and three
pro-life feminist guest columns have appeared in the Oracle, the
University of South Florida student newspaper.
   Now that her views have been thrust into the campaign, it has
created an emotional tug-of-war for her.
   ``I love my dad,'' she said, noting their similarities on a key
point - education and counseling to end abortion. Chiles has said
he respects his daughter's right to her own opinion and agrees
there is a common ground for them.
   During her pregnancy Mrs. Chiles-MacKinnon began to wonder about
her natural mother. She began a search for the woman who at 16 gave
birth to her and gave her up under pressure from her family. She
found her mother and they have since become friends.
   ``I was so grateful to the one who gave me life I wanted to find
her so she would know it and know what a wonderful life I have,''
said Mrs. Chiles-MacKinnon. Abortion at that time was illegal but
available.
   ``If it weren't for her choosing life for me, I wouldn't be here
today standing up for the lives of unborn children who don't have a
choice.''

<HEAD>Japanese Increasing Stake in U.S. Agribusiness, Farmland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has increased its investment in the U.S.
food system but still is a long way from taking over the nation's
farms and agribusiness network, an Agriculture Department analyst
says.
   For example, Japanese investors last year bought about $456
million worth of U.S. farmland, compared with $289 million spent in
1988.
   Before that, the biggest single-year Japanese investment in U.S.
farmland was $22 million in 1982, said Christine Bolling of the
department's Economic Research Service.
   Overall, about $1 billion worth of farmland - that agency
researchers are aware of - has been bought with Japanese money,
sometimes in joint ventures with U.S. companies. Also Japanese
investors have spend an additional $5 billion to buy or invest in
agriculturally related businesses.
   Bolling, whose study was reported in the November issue of
Farmline magazine, said the joint ventures with partial ownership
mask the overall presence of Japanese ownership.
   According to Commerce Department figures, total foreign
investment in the U.S. agribusiness sector is about $30 billion,
with an additional $10 billion in agricultural land.
   Thus, the $6 billion Japan has in farmland and related
industries represents about a 15 percent share of the $40 billion
foreign total.
   ``The U.S. agribusiness complex is so huge that foreign
properties are a small part of the whole complex,'' Bolling said.
   Japan is not the largest foreign investor in American
agriculture and agribusiness, she said. But it does appear to be
grow faster than some of the traditional leading investors,
including the United Kingdom.
   ``While some are concerned about increasing Japanese investment
in U.S., agribusiness, there should be no more concern than that
over British, Canadian or other foreign investment in the
agribusiness sector,'' Bolling said.
   Among the largest Japanese holdings are a 77,000-acre cattle
ranch in Montana, a 25,000-acre citrus grove in Florida, and a
1,000-acre prune orchard in northern California.
   In food processing, Bolling said, Japanese investors own the
second-largest vinegar company in the United States, several food
processing plants and a company that controls 60 percent of the
bread-baking industry in Hawaii.
   Japanese are also involved in California wines, bottled water
and soft drinks, Alaskan fish processing, textile mills and feed
additives and grain storage. Bolling said they also hold a major
interest in the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores.
   ``In some cases, Japanese investments in U.S. agribusiness are
part of a vertically integrated industry, where the products are
shipped to Japan,'' she said. ``Such situations have developed in
the citrus, prune and beef industries.''
   For example, Bolling said, Japan not only has bought a Montana
cattle ranch but also feedlots, and beef-processing plants in
Washington and California. She said joint ventures in feedlots have
been established in California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska,
Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming.
   Altogether, Bolling said, beef shipments originating from these
cattle operations represent 15 percent to 20 percent of the U.S.
beef exports to Japan.
   The Japanese investment in U.S. agribusiness is ``part of a
global phenomenon of market integration,'' she said. ``It also fits
in with Japan's situation in that it is an affluent but
food-deficit country that sets high standards for the food it
imports and consumes.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - About 330,000 farmers participating in the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program soon will be getting $1.6
billion in rental payments for taking cropland from production,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says.
   The payments are for the 1991 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
Yeutter said Tuesday the department's Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service will notify county offices to begin
payments immediately ``without any further delay.''
   During the recent budget-cutting maneuvers, it appeared the
payments would be delayed or even reduced. But Yeutter said full
cash payments will be made to cover contracts signed to place
cropland in the program during crop years 1986 through 1990.
   Under the program, farmers agree to idle highly erodible
cropland for 10 years. In return, the government helps pay the cost
of establishing protective grass or trees, and provides annual
rental payments for the land taken from production.
   The payments average nearly $50 per acre annually. Approximately
33.9 million acres have been signed up in the program.
   Yeutter's announcement was hailed by Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, as ``good
news for farmers who need to pay bills for this year's operations
and to make plans for next year.''
   De la Garza said the conservation program ``continues to play a
very important role'' in helping protect the environment.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Preliminary results show a new triple-whammy
beetle bait shows promise against corn rootworm beetles, according
to the Agriculture Department.
   Besides a small amount of lethal insecticide, the bait contains
a compound that attracts the beetles, and a feeding stimulant that
makes them eat more - a fatal last meal.
   Officials said the bait was spread on more than 1,000 acres of
corn in South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana in
August.
   Gerald R. Sutter of the department's Agricultural Research
Service in Brookings, S.D., said Tuesday in a report issued here
that if the new bait works, corn farmers ``could dramatically cut
insecticide use.''
   The bait contains only about 2 percent of the insecticide
normally used in sprays against the adult beetles, he said.
   Sutter said the preliminary results show the bait reduced beetle
populations in the corn. Next spring will show whether the
reduction was enough to significantly lower the beetles' egg laying
for a new hatch.

<HEAD>Two Incumbents Have More Campaign Cash Than 331 Challengers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Last-Minute Money</HEAD>

   The two House members with the biggest
campaign bank accounts entered the final five weeks of the 1990
election season with more money than all 331 House challengers
combined, according to a new survey.
   The review of the latest Federal Election Commission filings in
House races underscores the huge fund-raising advantages enjoyed by
incumbents.
   For example, the 406 House incumbents seeking re-election
entered the final stretch of the campaign with $97 million to
spend, 29 times more than the $3.3 million held by challengers.
   Seven of the 406 incumbents had at least $1 million in their
campaign accounts as of Sept. 30, according to the survey by Common
Cause, a citizens group that advocates public financing of election
campaigns.
   The two incumbents with the biggest war chests - Democratic
Reps. Mel Levine of California and Stephen Solarz of New York - had
more cash on hand than all 331 challengers combined.
   Levine reported a balance of $1.7 million, while Solarz had
$1.65 million.
   Not far behind were Reps. David Dreier, R-Calif., and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., who reported campaign balances of $1.6 million and
$1.4 million, respectively.
   Reps. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Robert Matsui, D-Calif., and
James Quillen, R-Tenn., each had $1 million on hand as of Sept. 30.
   In all, House incumbents have had $204 million to spend on 1990
elections, including $146 million raised since 1988 elections and
$58 million left over in campaign accounts, Common Cause said.
   That total is nine times more than the $24 million raised by
challengers, the survey found.
   Common Cause, which is seeking new restrictions on political
action committee donations, said House incumbents had reaped nearly
$70 million in PAC money in 1989 and the first nine months of 1990.
   Challengers received just $3.7 million from PACs in that period.
   The hefty fund-raising edge allows incumbents to easily outspend
their opponents.
   House incumbents spent $96.9 million from Jan. 1, 1989, through
Sept. 30, nearly five times the $20 million spent by challengers.
   ``The extraordinary campaign finance advantage that House
incumbents have over their challengers is corrupting our political
process to the point where we won't have real elections for the
House of Representatives in 1990,'' Common Cause President Fred
Wertheimer said in a statement released with the organization's
latest campaign finance survey.
   Common Cause said there were only 29 House races in which the
challenger had raised at least half as much as the incumbent; in
eight of those races the challengers had raised more.

   When the cost of the Senate race in North
Carolina between Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt is tallied it will be
easy to forget the $220.72 spent on paper and envelopes in faraway
Iowa.
   Neither candidate is shopping out of state. The supplies were
for a conservative group's mailing criticizing Democrat Gantt. The
spending is just a tiny slice of the millions special interest
groups are pouring into targeted races as the 1990 campaign draws
to a close.
   The money, not subject to contribution limits because it never
enters campaign treasuries, is coming from such diverse groups as
the Realtors political action committee, abortion rights groups,
anti-abortion forces, environmentalists and a PAC representing
dealers of Japanese-made cars.
   Entering the final week of the campaign, special interests had
reported spending roughly $4 million on independent expenditures to
influence congressional campaigns. In 1988, about $7.2 million in
independent expenditures on congressional races was reported.
   This year, the matchup between Helms, a three-term GOP
incumbent, and Gantt is a favorite target, drawing money from
labor, conservative and gay-rights groups as well as both sides of
the abortion debate.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League, for example, has
spent $200,000 on radio, television and other ads attacking Helms'
anti-abortion stance, according to Federal Election Commission
records.
   Other major races targeted by NARAL for large independent
spending include the Iowa Senate race between Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin and Republican Rep. Tom Tauke, the Florida governor's race
and House contests in Oregon and Florida.
   NARAL and its Iowa affiliate reported spending more than $93,000
in September and October to support Harkin, and $3,000 to oppose
Tauke.
   Its federal filings show nearly $80,000 has been spent to oppose
the re-election of Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, a staunch abortion
foe. Most of NARAL's spending on that state race does not have to
be reported to the FEC.
   NARAL's spending in the past two weeks also has included $25,000
and $1,800 to oppose the re-election of Republican Reps. Denny
Smith of Oregon and Craig James of Florida, respectively.
   Not surprisingly, anti-abortion groups also are involved in many
of the same contests.
   The National Right to Life PAC has paid for mailings to support
eight candidates, including Helms, Smith and James. Several Right
to Life state PACs also mounted modest independent spending
campaigns in recent weeks.
   A handful of conservative groups have spent a combined $100,000
on independent expenditures in the past four months. They were led
by the Conservative Republican Committee, which reported $77,500 in
independent spending - $28,000 of that supporting Helms.
   Much of the spending by the conservative groups has been for
telephone banks, mailings and radio ads opposing liberal Democratic
senators.
   The National Education Association's PAC reported spending
$100,000 to support Gantt. A gay-rights group and a PAC
representing social workers reported far more modest efforts on
Gantt's behalf, and a North Carolina PAC formed to oppose Helms
reported spending $15,000 on radio ads attacking the conservative
Republican.
   The biggest spender so far is the Realtors PAC, which as of last
week reported making $802,500 in independent expenditures on a
dozen races.
   The Realtors spent $168,000 and $108,000 to support the Senate
bids of Republican Reps. Hank Brown of Colorado and Larry Craig of
Idaho, respectively.
   The Realtors also spent heavily to support freshmen House
members Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., $70,000; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
R-Fla., $70,000; and Ben Jones, D-Ga., $93,500. And it spent nearly
$73,000 to support Republican Rep. Jack Buechner of Missouri, who
is seeking a third term.
   The most controversial spending has been the more than $340,000
spent by the Auto Dealers &amp; Drivers for Free Trade PAC to support
the Senate candidacy of New Hampshire Republican Rep. Bob Smith.
   The PAC is running television ads supporting Smith, leading
Democratic challenger John Durkin to protest that the organization
is trying to buy his opponent.
   ``I won't sell out to the Japs,'' Durkin said last week in
criticizing the PAC, whose members sell Japanese-made cars. Durkin
has made an issue of the spending. Smith's camp has criticized
Durkin's use of the word ``Japs.''
   The Realtors also reported spending $54,600 to support Smith.

<HEAD>British Police Guilty of Bias Against Indian-Born Constable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first ruling of its kind in Britain, an
industrial tribunal has found that a British policeman of Indian
origin suffered racial discrimination from fellow police officers.
   Constable Surinder Chima Singh, 33, had complained he was barred
from joining the Criminal Investigation Department of the
Nottinghamshire county police force in 1987 because of his race.
   The tribunal is empowered to order the force to compensate Singh
and will hear more evidence before ruling on his claim for damages.
   The tribunal's chairman, Christopher Tickle, said during
Tuesday's hearing in the central British city of Nottingham that
Singh had as he claimed been the butt of racist language.
   Tickle said that Singh's race had caused him to be treated less
favorably than other officers who applied to join the investigation
department.
   Singh, from Nottingham, was born in India but grew up in
Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. He received a chemistry degree from
Lancaster University before joining the Nottinghamshire force in
1981.
   Earlier this year, police launched a nationwide drive to recruit
from racial minority groups, mostly blacks from the West Indies and
people from the Indian subcontinent.
   Ethnic minority groups comprise 3.9 percent of the economically
active working-age population in Britain and 10 percent in London.
   Police figures published at the beginning of this year showed 1
percent of police officers in England and Wales and about 1.5
percent of police in London's metropolitan force are from racial
minorities.
   Industrial tribunals operate Britain's main judicial system,
hearing disputes between employees and employers, mainly cases
where unfair dismissal is alleged. They cannot force an employer to
take back a fired worer or five the worker the job to which he
claims he's entitled.

<HEAD>Butterfly Town USA to Decide Preservation of Namesake Insect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in this city dubbed
``Butterfly Town USA'' decide next Tuesday whether to float a $1.2
million bond issue to protect a grove of pines and eucalyptus trees
where monarchs - and tourists - gather.
   Developers and property rights groups oppose the measure, which
calls for $1.2 million in borrowing to buy and set aside a 2.7-acre
butterfly habitat.
   Butterfly fanciers insist that protecting the privately owned
Diveley Grove is vital to saving the species in this part of the
country.
   ``If we don't preserve this grove, 10 to 20 years from now the
butterflies will be in trouble,'' said Ro Vaccaro, member of the
Friends of the Monarch. ``They're running out of wintering sites.
And they need a very specific climate with the perfect humidity,
temperatures and trees.
   ``I just can't image Butterfly Town USA without butterflies.''
   If the bond issue wins the required two-thirds vote, property
taxes would rise 1.5 cents per $100 of assessed valuation - about
$15 a year on a $100,000 home.
   Butterflies have long held a special place in the lives of the
16,000 residents of this seaside town 105 miles south of San
Francisco.
   On the second Saturday of each October, children dress up as
butterflies and march through town, spreading colorful wings to
usher in the fall butterfly season.
   The grove of Monterey pine and eucalyptus trees is one of the
few remaining wintering grounds in the Western United States for
the orange and black butterflies.
   In the 1940s, as many as 2 million monarchs flew south from
Canada to winter in Pacific Grove, compared to tens of thousands
now. Monarchs east of the Rockies winter near the Gulf of Mexico,
where their habitat is also dwindling as trees are cut.
   Some residents, including Steven Magyar, say the bond issue
tramples on property rights. The City Council put the measure on
the ballot after wavering on whether to allow development of the
land.
   ``If somebody wants to develop their property, they should be
able to. The butterflies will still hang around,'' Magyar said.
``Everybody's in favor of remaining the butterfly capital, but
butterflies aren't the end-all, be-all.''
   ``I hope the bond passes because I want to see the butterflies
stay here,'' said 81-year-old Edna Milar Diveley, who owns the
grove. ``But they're going to have to rehabilitate the grove. There
aren't enough lower and middle branches on the trees to keep the
butterflies happy.''
   Mrs. Diveley retired and sold a motel adjacent to the property,
the Butterfly Grove Inn, some 25 years ago, but in 1988 she decided
to sell or develop the Diveley Grove.
   The City Council approved her plan to build housing units with a
one-acre buffer zone for the tree grove. But public outcry prompted
city leaders to put on the ballot the issue of whether to buy and
set aside the entire property.

<HEAD>Budget Deal Hits Northeast Hard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxpayers in the Northeast would be hit harder
than any other region in the country under the deficit-reduction
package awaiting President Bush's signature, a non-profit group
says.
   Of the 10 states facing the highest tax increases, five are in
the Northeast, the Tax Foundation said Tuesday.
   These same five states - Connecticut, New Jersey, New York,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire - already pay among the highest
federal taxes in the nation on a per capita basis. And the
increases come at a time when these states are limping through a
recession.
   ``They're getting hit harder because the new budget package is
more heavily weighed to high-income earners,'' said Paul Merski,
the non-profit Tax Foundation's director of fiscal affairs. ``About
45 percent of the tax increases for the new package are for
high-income earners.''
   Many lawmakers from the Northeast supported the
deficit-reduction package even though it hit their districts
harder. Democrats, in particular, were anxious to position
themselves in favor of higher taxes on the wealthy, even if those
wealthy were their own constituents.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Tuesday there was no irony in
the voting pattern.
   ``If the state is wealthier than another state and you get hurt
that's what you have to expect if you favor progressive taxation,''
Frank said. ``If the state pays more as a result of being a
higher-income state, I don't regret that at all.''
   The high tax burdens of the five northeastern states reflect
their populations, which include the New York commuter-executives
of suburban New Jersey and Connecticut; the Park Avenue elite; the
insurance industry executives of Hartford, Conn.; highly skilled
and highly paid defense workers in Connecticut; and high-tech
industry executives and workers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
   Connecticut residents, on average, will bear the largest burden
in the nation and the largest dollar increase. The tax increases
will cost the average Connecticut resident $174 for one year. That
compares to a national average of $133.
   The Massachusetts delegation voted 9-2 against the original
budget summit agreement that was rejected by the House Oct. 5. That
plan would have raised all federal taxes on Massachusetts residents
by an average $100, according to the Tax Foundation.
   Less than a month later, the Massachusetts delegation voted 10-1
in favor of the deficit reduction plan approved by Congress. It
raises taxes for Massachusetts resident by an average $158, the
fourth highest in the nation.
   Frank noted the original budget summit agreement included many
items that would have hit poor and middle-class northeasterners in
the wallet, including a higher gasoline tax and a tax on home
heating oil.
   The New York state delegation voted 18-16 against that budget
agreement, which would have cost each New Yorker an extra $91. Last
weekend the delegation voted 21-12, with one absent, for the new
budget package that will cost their constituents an average $145 in
higher taxes.
   New Jersey would have the second-highest per capita increase in
the country under the new budget plan, at $173. New Hampshire,
which ranks sixth, would absorb $149 in higher taxes per person.
   A number of provisions in the budget and tax package passed by
Congress are intended to shift the burden to the rich. The proposal
increases taxes on luxury items such as furs, jewelry and yachts,
hikes the tax on airline tickets, and raises the wealthiest
taxpayers from a 28 percent tax rate to a 31 percent rate.
   The measure also limits the deductions that wealthy taxpayers
can claim and increases their share of a special hospitalization
tax.

<TEXT>
   Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton
Williams stumbled when asked his position on a proposed
constitutional amendment on next week's ballot that deals with
appointments by the state's chief executive.
   In a session Tuesday with reporters at KERA-TV studios in
Dallas, Williams said he was unfamiliar with the amendment, the
only one on the ballot, and was unclear how he had voted on it when
he cast his absentee ballot.
   Williams' opponent, Democrat Ann Richards, has criticized
Williams, a Midland businessman, as a political amateur who doesn't
understand government.
   Asked if his confusion did not lend credence to Richards'
charges, Williams said, ``I'm not a politician.''
   ``But you are running for governor,'' Slater said.
   ``Yeah, I can read and if you put that in front of me it would
take me about 30 seconds to give you my opinion,'' Williams said.
``I had the highest grade point in the school of agriculture at

<HEAD>Citing Earthquake Projection, Clerks Ask Delay of Dec. 4 Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor's office has turned down
a request from Missouri officials to reschedule a Dec. 4 special
election because of earthquake concerns.
   ``It's not like we're in a panic, but we thought it might ease
everyone's mind if we did it another day,'' Stoddard County Clerk
Don White said Tuesday from his office in Bloomfield.
   The election is to fill the Missouri Senate seat held by
Democrat Steve Sharp of Kennett, who resigned to accept a circuit
judge appointment. The Senate district is composed of Butler,
Carter, Dunklin, Pemiscot, Ripley and Stoddard counties.
   Election Day coincides with New Mexico climatologist Iben
Browning's projection for an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault,
which runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark.
   Earthquake drills have been scheduled and schools have planned
to close because of the projection, although many scientists have
criticized Browning's methods and conclusions.
   White noted that schools double as polls across the district.
   ``I am, frankly, a little concerned about putting election
judges in school buildings that school boards deemed it necessary
to close because of safety questions. But we'll have to go ahead
and have them open the buildings up,'' White said.
   ``If we have an earthquake - well, we'll just have problems,''
he said.

   The Republican Party in North Carolina is
intimidating Democratic voters with a mail campaign, says state
Democratic Chairman Lawrence Davis.
   State Republican officials said they were trying to ensure legal
election returns.
   Davis said the GOP is mailing postcards to registered Democrats
across the state, saying if they haven't lived in their precinct
for at least the last 30 days they can't vote.
   ``This is an outright lie,'' Davis said.
   Voters who have moved from the precinct in which they are
registered may go to the Board of Elections before they vote or to
the precinct in which they are registered on Election Day and get
transferred to the precinct in which they currently reside.

   It's not exactly Neiman-Marcus, but a mail-order
catalog from Dallas will allow soldiers in Saudi Arabia to play
Santa Claus.
   With the Army and Air Force Exchange Service catalog, the
200,000 soldiers in the Persian Gulf can shop for loved ones back
home without leaving their desert tents. Tens of thousands of
copies of the Christmas catalog are on their way to the Middle
East.
   ``One of the things I think most of our American troops over
there are accustomed to is the ability to go in and browse in nice
stores. And we want to give them that capability, every day if
their duties will allow that,'' said Maj. Gen. Jeffery B. Kahla,
who heads AAFES.
   ``Our goal is customer satisfaction, whether people are in the
sands of Saudi Arabia or living in a beautiful house in Dallas,
Texas.''
   In addition to a mail-order service, the 95-year-old,
self-supporting organization with headquarters in Dallas runs
cut-rate stores on bases in the United States and around the world
for members of the military and their dependents.
   The stores are known in Air Force slang as ``BX,'' for base
exchange; in the Army, it's ``PX,'' for post exchange. Altogether,
AAFES generates about $7 billion in annual sales and employs 82,000
mostly civilian employees.
   The AAFES set up field exchange stores within 15 days of the
beginning of Operation Desert Shield, Kahla said.
   The 50 shops in Saudi Arabia offer soldiers candy, sodas,
cigarettes, lotion and batteries - lots of batteries, mostly for
cameras and personal stereos, also for sale. Shoppers also can buy
socks, underwear and plastic thongs, popular for walking across the
burning sand to the showers, Kahla said.
   The only things missing are alcohol and adult magazines, barred
by the Saudis, Kahla said.
   Exchange sales in Saudi Arabia have reached about $3 million a
month, he said.
   Some of the shops operated originally from the backs of trucks.
Most are now in cramped tents, with shelves of wooden slats and
sand or wood floors. Few as yet have air conditioning or
refrigerators.
   And the inventory is limited to 350 items, which means, for
example, that the only cassette tapes for sale are those in the Top
10.
   But it's still a link to home.
   ``It probably looks just like Neiman-Marcus to them,'' Kahla
said, referring to the luxurious Dallas-based department store.
   About 98,000 copies of the Christmas catalog have been sent to
Saudi Arabia, and an equal number are ready to be shipped. The
troops' orders will be processed at AAFES in Dallas and filled from
a warehouse or vendor.
   The Christmas catalog is available at military exchanges around
the world. But orders from those stationed in the Persian Gulf will
get top priority.
   ``We just don't want them to order something for their
girlfriend or their mother and have it come back not in stock.
Because they don't have another choice,'' Kahla said.
   The catalog includes items found in most any stateside store:
model planes and tanks, puzzles, roller skates, walkie-talkies and
wagons.
   There is the Bear Forces of America - 20-inch teddy bears
wearing the uniforms of the four service branches, available in
desert camouflage.
   There are housewares, jewelry, clothing and a grandfather clock.
Soldiers can even order a personal tanner, although the idea may
not have much appeal in the desert.
   Despite the Saudi ban on non-Moslem religious symbols, angel
ornaments and creche figures are available in the catalog.
   ``I know that the BX is important because I've been to war. It's
very important to the morale of the troops,'' Kahla said. ``It made
me feel like I was a little bit back home.''
   In the Gulf, AAFES also circulates hit movies, operates vending
machines, manages pay phones and plans to open barber shops within
about two weeks.
   One walk-up ``generic fast-food outlet'' has opened, with plans
for four or five more. Next may be a mobile Popeye's fried chicken
franchise.

<HEAD>Hostages Issue Pleas in Letters Smuggled Out of Kuwait and Iraq</HEAD>

   On Sept. 28, he wrote: ``Things get worse by the day.''
   The Midwestern dentist is still stranded in Kuwait a month
later, but his plea made it out. It is among a trickle of letters
that newly released hostages have smuggled past Iraqi troops.
   Some are hastily scrawled on notepaper; others are typed. All
offer stark, urgent views of the Persian Gulf through the eyes of
those trapped when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The letters talk of daily trivia and tell tales of atrocities.
They also carry the hostages' provisional attempts at proper
goodbyes, postmarked in Bangladesh or Maryland or England -
wherever newly freed foreigners pass their first mail slot.
   ``The situation here is entirely out of control,'' wrote the
dentist, whose letters from Kuwait were provided on the condition
he not be identified.
   ``I am in a `safe' house with a good friend. We are surrounded
by Iraqi troops ... and there is a great deal of shooting in the
area at night,'' the letter continued.
   ``(The Iraqis) have destroyed all forms of normalcy here.
Looting, rape and sodomy and wanton destruction. ... Food stocks
are almost gone and the garbage and rodent problems are increasing.
... Things here get worse by the day.''
   The estimated 1,000 Americans stuck in Kuwait and Iraq are from
varied backgrounds. They were in the Middle East as teachers,
diplomats, oil workers, engineers and consultants.
   But in their letters are common themes: calls for quick and
decisive American intervention, complaints about boredom and
fatigue. For many hostages, time is measured by what they may be
missing at home.
   ``Darling, the days and nights are long and boring,'' Fred F.
Harrington, a Redmond, Wash., businessman held as one of Saddam
Hussein's ``human shields,'' wrote to his wife.
   ``I do lots of reading, American and British novels. There is TV
and VCR in the lounge. Breakfast is at 9 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m. and
dinner at 7 p.m. Food is lousy. ... My back hurts,'' Harrington
wrote in a letter dated Sept. 4.
   ``People here are terrified,'' a 26-year-old Kuwaiti wrote to H.
Norman Angell, a friend in Bainbridge Island, Wash. ``One of my
relatives was shot in front of his family after he was tortured for
two months. He was 23 years old.
   ``Two of my cousins were taken away ... and nobody knows where
they are now,'' wrote Angell's friend, whose cousin escaped and
mailed the letter after reaching Germany.
   ``Tensions run high,'' wrote Mike Nickman, whose work on an
irrigation project in Iraq was interrupted by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``They have security police sitting outside our door, waiting
for one of us to leave,'' he wrote in a Sept. 4 letter smuggled out
of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad by a British woman who forwarded it
to Nickman's parents in Pleaston, Neb.
   ``My patience is in short supply. It is easy for my temper to
rise up and of course in this situation that's not very wise,''
wrote Guy Seago, a 49-year-old oil worker captured by Iraqi troops
while trying to escape Kuwait.
   In their letters, many of the hostages mention their tempers.
They are tired of listening to the Voice of America and waiting for
the United States, which has deployed 220,000 soldiers, to strike.
   ``It has become a pretty tedious existence, but preferable to
being in Baghdad or at some military installation,'' wrote the
dentist, whose attorney provided copies of several letters. ``Those
poor people will be killed when the shooting starts, as the Iraqis
have nothing to lose.''
   For American hostages and their families, the loss could be
enormous.
   ``You have given me great joy,'' Joseph Murphy, a 63-year-old
teacher wrote to his daughter in Fremont, Calif., from the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``Be smart and strong and brave, my darling. You have a great
life ahead of you,'' he wrote. ``I love you.''

<HEAD>PLO Urges Arab Countries To Drop Effort To Expel Israel From
General Assembly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major policy change, the Palestine
Liberation Organization is urging Arab countries to halt their
8-year-old effort to expel Israel from the U.N. General Assembly.
   The move is a gesture of moderation by an increasingly isolated
PLO, which has lost some Arab support for siding with Iraq in the
Persian Gulf crisis and saw its dialogue with Washington cut off
earlier this year over a PLO faction's attack on an Israeli beach.
   In a private meeting of Arab ambassadors on Tuesday, Palestinian
and other Arab diplomats said PLO head envoy Nasser al-Kidwa
proposed that the Arabs vote to accept Israel's credentials.
   Credentials of all nations must be approved each year, allowing
representation in the U.N. General Assembly.
   However, the Arabs would propose an amendment to the official
membership list that reminds Israel of its obligation to obey
Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the Middle
East.
   Security Council resolutions have attacked Israel's declaration
of a unified Jerusalem as its capital and, this month, ``deplored''
the Oct. 8 Temple Mount killings in which police killed 20
Palestinians during a stone-throwing protest in Jerusalem.
   General Assembly resolutions call for separate homelands for
Palestinians and Jews, and guarantee the right of Palestinian
exiles to go home to the new Palestine.
   Israel's U.N. mission was informed of the proposal but had no
immediate formal response.
   The Arab ambassadors were unable to agree immediately on the PLO
proposal. One problem for them seemed to be whether voting for
Israel's U.N. membership, even with those amendments, would
constitute recognition of Israel.
   ``I think they are very concerned about the implications
themselves,'' said one Western ambassador who is an expert on the
Middle East.
   The chairman of the Arab group, Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammad
Abulhasan, said he would likely ask the General Assembly president
to delay consideration of the membership issue rather than take it
up Thursday, as scheduled.
   Israel has been U.N. member since the Jewish state was founded
in 1948.
   Since 1982, the Arabs have challenged Israel's right to sit in
the General Assembly, claiming it is not a peace-loving state as
required by the U.N. Charter.
   The Arabs have lost every year, and last year the Soviet Union
abstained on the issue rather than voting with them. This year, the
Soviets are expected to vote in favor of Israel.
   Al-Kidwa characterized the PLO's move as ``a more positive
approach'' the Israel-Palestinian issue.
   This is the first major new diplomatic move by al-Kidwa, a
nephew of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. Veteran PLO Ambassador Zuhdi
Labib Terzi retired from his 16-year posting as head of the
delegation last month to become an adviser to Arafat. The PLO has
observer status at the United Nations.
   Observers believe that hard-line Arab states such as Syria,
Libya and Iraq will not support al-Kidwa's proposal if it is viewed
as amounting to some form of recognition of Israel.
   In 1948, the newly founded Israeli government was willing to
accept the General Assembly resolutions setting up two states, but
the Arab nations rejected the two-state idea and attacked Israel
the day after it declared itself a nation.
   Israel captured about half the land that was supposed to become
an Arab Palestinian state, and the other half was divided between
Jordan and Egypt.
   The Israeli government has claimed since then that it needs to
retain some of the occupied territory as a buffer against Arab
attacks.
   In 1988, Arafat became the first Arab leader to endorse the
two-state concept originally devised by the United Nations.
   The PLO lost significant financial and political support from
some Arab countries after Arafat sided with Saddam Hussein on the
Iraqi leader's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait. Arafat has since been
trying to play a mediating role.
   Saddam has said he wants to link any solution to the crisis with
an Israeli pullout from occupied territories and has won the
support of many of the Palestinians living in those lands.
   Washington broke off dialogue with the PLO in June after Arafat
refused to condemn a May 30 raid on a Tel Aviv beach by guerrillas
of the Palestine Liberation Front led by Abu Abbas.
   There were no Israeli casualties in the attack.

<HEAD>Japanese Outcasts Stifle Debate About Own Problem</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's outcast community has attacked an author
who committed a faux pas in this nation where prejudice goes deep
but largely undiscussed - he wrote about their plight.
   Trouble started for Dutch author Karel Van Wolferen when he
wrote that Japan's burakumin community has used confrontational
tactics to scare editors, publishers and TV producers into silence
about its problems.
   As a result, the problems can't be addressed, the author says.
   Van Wolferen saw his book, ``The Enigma of Japanese Power,''
fall victim to the same treatment when the Burakumin Liberation
League pressured his Tokyo publisher into temporarily halting
sales.
   ``Burakumin'' - meaning hamlet people - is a euphemism for a
former social class considered unclean in feudal Japan because they
dealt with death. For centuries they were Japan's butchers,
gravediggers and tanners.
   Though physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, their
more than 1 million descendants today live in separate communities
and the government keeps meticulous records on family histories.
They have trouble marrying into the mainstream and getting decent
jobs.
   Even mentioning their existence is taboo for most Japanese.
   Indeed, it was only in August 1989 that a Japanese television
producer dared for the first time to broadcast a program on
burakumin prejudice.
   On Tuesday, Van Wolferen challenged a burakumin leader in a
debate to drop rough tactics that, ironically he says, have helped
perpetuate their lowly status and ``self-censor'' the problem of
prejudice in Japan.
   Van Wolferen and his publisher won't say what pressuring tactics
were used to halt Japanese sales of his book, which has been sold
in the United States since last year.
   But the burakumin group is known for cornering offending
writers, teachers or scholars whose opinions they object to and
verbally harassing them.
   ``Many Japanese scholars won't touch the subject of burakumin,
in part because they're afraid of the liberation league coming and
trashing their office,'' said Columbia University anthropologist
Theodore Bestor, who is doing research in Japan.
   Van Wolferen suggested that such enforced silence about social
discrimination has led many Japanese to remain ignorant of its
impact. That in turn gives rise to the kind of racial slur uttered
recently by Japan's justice minister, Seiroku Kajiyama, who
compared U.S. blacks to prostitutes.
   ``The average Japanese has heard more about discrimination
against blacks and other minorities in the United States than about
Japan's minorities,'' Van Wolferen said.
   Tatsukuni Komori, the league's secretary general, responded
during the debate that his group ``welcomes all criticism.''
   ``We have never asked someone to rewrite or correct a passage
that seems to be critical of the Burakumin Liberation League,''
said Komori, who also represents his community in Parliament. ``But
if factual inaccuracies are spread then we will probably have to
resort to other measures.''
   Komori said the league pressured Van Wolferen's publisher,
Hayakawa Shobo, into halting sales in early October and a planned
advertising campaign for the book's Japanese version because it
used ``discriminatory language'' to describe the community and made
factual errors.
   During the debate, Van Wolferen said he had agreed to change
``special villages'' - long used to refer to the burakumin - to
``special communities.'' But he said he stood by the book's
findings.
   The book went back on store shelves in mid-October after Van
Wolferen urged his publisher to overcome its fear and resume sales.
   Tuesday's debate was part of his effort to try to reach
agreement with the burakumin on altering the next printing.
   The controversy has underscored one of the major themes of Van
Wolferen's book, which argues that political and social change in
Japan is stifled in part by the inability to discuss it.
   ``The (league) has been trying to get United Nations recognition
as an oppressed minority,'' he said after the debate, held at the
Foreign Correspondents Club. ``But U.N. officials say they can't
find enough written about the burakumin in Japan'' to make a
decision.
   Val Wolferen said he thought the liberation league ``is at
juncture where it may well begin to study its methods.''
   Other analysts say that unwillingness to discuss prejudice
extends to Japan's other huge minority, those of Korean descent,
and other groups.
   Japanese, accustomed to hearing their society described as
homogenous, ``are fundamentally not even aware of prejudice because
they don't see these minorities as being internal to Japanese
society,'' said Bestor.
   When protests arose several years ago over a government law that
requires fingerprinting of Japan's Korean minority, Bestor said, he
remembers being shocked at the reaction of a Japanese friend he
considered ``fairly well informed.''
   ``He didn't know until I told him that the people being
fingerprinted were born in Japan and in some cases were third and
fourth generation. He couldn't understand why they were disobeying
the rules of their host country.''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stocks Fall Off Earlier Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped from its opening but ended
higher against the Japanese yen in Tokyo on Wednesday, while share
prices lost early gains.
   The dollar closed at 129.35 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's
129.00-yen finish. It opened higher at 129.37 yen and ranged
between 128.88 yen and 129.70 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 48.30 points, or 0.19
percent, ending the day at 25,194.10. The index rose about 200
points before sinking following a fall in government bond prices,
traders said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip came on selling from
institutional investors attempting to take profits, said a dealer
with Mitsubishi Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Otherwise, he said, ``the dollar-yen was moving quietly as
investors slowed down major moves before their end-of-the-month
book balancing.''
   Dealers said the market has already adjusted for the
higher-than-expected 1.8 percent U.S. third-quarter gross national
product figure.
   On the stock market, brokers said the index's early gain was in
reaction to a 17.82-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average
in New York and the yen's relative stability against the dollar
despite the better-than-expected U.S. gross national product report
for the third quarter.
   ``Index-linked large-scale buying also supported the Nikkei
until about mid-morning, but the index started to slip because of
the falling bond prices,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with
Nomura Securities Co.
   He said the yen's stability was the key to the recent stock
market performances amid volatile foreign exchange trading.

   The jury that convicted Ramon
Salcido of murdering his wife, two daughters, boss and three others
returns next week to decide whether the former winery worker should
die in the gas chamber.
   Salcido, 29, was found guilty Tuesday in an April 14, 1989
rampage in which he criss-crossed the Sonoma Valley in California
wine country, stabbing and shooting his victims. He slit his
daughrers' throats and left them to die at a dump.
   The sentencing stage begins Tuesday. The jury, which reached its
verdict on its fourth day of deliberations, can recommend death or
life in prison without parole.
   ``What this means for the families is perhaps one chapter of
this horrible nightmare will be laid to rest,'' Prosecutor Peter
Bumerts said after the verdict.
   ``We knew he was going to die in prison, one way or another,''
said defense attorney Marteen Miller.
   Although Salcido confessed in a taped statement that was the
prosecution's key evidence, his lawyers tried to save his life by
portraying him as suicidal and mentally ill. They argued he
suffered from a psychotic depression that was aggravated by an
alcohol and cocaine binge in the hours before the rampage.
   The prosecution scoffed at the notion Salcido was suicidal,
saying the killer demonstrated his methodical ways when he stepped
over dead bodies to bandage his finger, which he cut while stabbing
a victim to death.
   He was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder, one of
second-degree murder and other offenses.
   A first-degree murder conviction requires proof of
premeditation; defense attorneys had urged jurors to opt for
second-degree murder or manslaughter.
   According to testimony, Salcido began his murderous frenzy after
a night of bar-hopping and cocaine-snorting. When he arrived home
around 5 a.m., he was furious that his wife was gone.
   He grabbed the couple's three young girls and drove to the
county dump, where he slashed each child's throat and left them to
die. One of them, Carmina, then 2, survived, telling investigators,
``Daddy cut me.''
   Salcido's next stopped at his mother-in-law's home, fatally
stabbing Marian Richards and two of her daughters.
   When he returned home, Salcido fatally shot his wife, Angela,
and headed for the Grand Cru Winery, where he killed his boss,
Tracey Toovey.
   Salcido also went to the home of his co-worker, Ken Butti, and
shot Butti and tried to shoot his wife, Terri, before fleeing.
Butti recovered from the wound.
   Salcido was arrested four days later in his native Mexico. He
told investigators he was mad that his wife had hidden that their
first child was fathered by another man.
   The trial was moved to San Mateo County because of publicity in
Sonoma County.

   Arkansas' attorney general says he
billed personal expenses to a state credit card because it's hard
for him to separate his personal life from his business affairs.
   ``I live, eat sleep and breathe politics,'' Steve Clark
testified Tuesday at his theft trial. ``That is the truth. It's not
necessarily good, but it's the truth.''
   Holding back tears at times during 2{ hours on the stand, Clark,
43, said he made mistakes on his expense records but didn't intend
to steal from the state.
   Clark is accused of entertaining friends, girlfriends, family
and political supporters on a state-issued credit card, running up
a tab of at least $8,448.27 for the meals of personal guests on 56
occasions from 1986 to 1989.
   He could get up to 20 years in prison and a $15,000 fine if
convicted.
   The charges forced Clark to drop out of the race for the
Democratic nomination for governor.
   The prosecution contends Clark used the card to support a
standard of living he couldn't afford on his $26,500 annual salary,
among the lowest in the nation for a state attorney general.
   Clark maintained he had complete discretion to use the card as
he wished, without keeping records. But Circuit Judge Perry
Whitmore disagreed, denying a defense motion Tuesday to dismiss the
case.
   The attorney general said he filled out expense forms up to
three months late, accidentally recording as guests people who
didn't eat with him.
   More than 100 of 141 witnesses who testified last week said they
didn't dine with Clark or discuss state business when he said they
had.
   ``I never in my entire life meant to mislead or deceive or
misrepresent,'' Clark said. ``I only meant to recall.''

   Salman Rushdie surfaced on CBS' ``60
Minutes,'' coming out of hiding long enough to make the program the
most-watched show on television last week.
   NBC won, just barely, in the overall ratings, placing four shows
in the top 10, the A.C. Nielsen Co. said Tuesday. ``Cheers'' was
No. 2, and ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Empty Nest'' tied for eighth,
followed by ``A Different World.''
   Fox and ``The Simpsons'' suffered their worst ratings since
original fall episodes began competing with ``Cosby'' three weeks
ago. The animated Simpson family plummeted to No. 24. The show's
Oct. 11 premiere ranked eighth.
   An interview by ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike Wallace with
Rushdie, who has lived in hiding since his novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' led some Islamic leaders to issue a death sentence against
him last year, helped the Sunday newsmagazine capture the No. 1
spot for the first time in the 6-week-old season.
   ``Cheers'' had been No. 1 for most of the new season.
   Separated by only one-tenth of a ratings point, the three
networks were led by NBC with a 12.5, followed by ABC with 12.4 and
CBS with 12.3. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   The top 10 was again dominated by longstanding hits, even though
the season has had the most new shows in TV history. The
highest-rated original fall program, at No. 20, was ``America's
Funniest People'' - a spinoff of ABC's hugely successful
``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   The newest Nielsen numbers also show that the battle between the
networks continues to produce no big winners. With competition from
alternative programmers like cable and Fox Broadcasting Co., the
three major broadcasters are barely able to distinguish themselves
from one another in the ratings.
   The network news ratings were won again by ABC and Peter
Jennings, with a 10.6. CBS and Dan Rather had a 9.5, and NBC and
Tom Brokaw a 9.1.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 21.1; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 20.4; ``Roseanne,'' ABC,
20.1; ``Designing Women,'' CBS, 19.9; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, 18.6;
``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS, 18.5; ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC, 18.1; ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Empty Nest, NBC
(tie), 18; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 17.9.

<HEAD>Marines Begin Amphibious Assault Exercise With Arab Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amphibious assault training exercise is
under way in the Persian Gulf that a Pentagon source says will
involve landing more than 10,000 Marines on a beach in Oman.
   The exercise, which started Tuesday and is to last 10 days, is
the second major Marine practice of amphibious assault techniques
that could be used in the event President Bush ordered an offensive
against Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
   The first was conducted on an Omani beach in September.
   Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said the exercise involves
elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and Amphibious
Task Group 2, which have been in the gulf as part of Operation
Desert Shield to defend Saudi Arabia against possible Iraqi attack.
   Hall called the maneuver a ``routine amphibious training
exercise'' designed to ``refamiliarize these forces with a desert
environment.'' He declined to specify the number of marines and
ships involved.
   A Pentagon source, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said 18 ships, including Marine Corps amphibious vessels and Navy
warships, will participate in the exercise, which he said also will
involve forces from allied gulf nations.
   Hall said 20 airplanes and 75 helicopters will be used in
staging the beach assault.
   The amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima was en route to the
exercise area Tuesday when a boiler pipe ruptured, killing eight
sailors and critically injuring two others.
   Hall said it had not been decided whether the 1,100 Marines
aboard the Iwo Jima would participate in the beach assault exercise
as planned after the ship is repaired.

   Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee is trying to
oust Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan as head of the House
Repulican campaign organization, sources say.
   Sundquist began making telephone calls and contacting colleagues
in the final hours before Congress adjourned this weekend to
recruit support for his bid.
   One Republican staff source, speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday that the challenge is opposed by Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 GOP leader in the House. Gingrich
views Sundquist's bid just a week before the Nov. 6 elections as a
damaging distraction to the campaign arm, the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   Sundquist spokesman Ralph Perrey acknowledged that his boss had
discussed running against Vander Jagt with colleagues, but added he
would make no formal announcement until after the elections.
   ``Mr. Sundquist has a background as a manager of campaigns, a
grassroots organizer and one who can recruit and develop
candidates,'' Perrey said. ``Many believe those are precisely the
skills needed'' at the NRCC now.

<HEAD>Lawyers' Group Asks Ban on Over-the-Counter Sales of Asthma Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyers' group and medical experts are
urging the government to strengthen safeguards for people with
asthma who use an effective but potentially dangerous drug.
   They said Tuesday that over-the-counter asthma medications
containing the drug theophylline should be banned.
   And they want physicians and patients to be made more aware of
potential hazards also associated with prescription versions of the
drug.
   ``Our message about theophylline is that this medication can be
a lifesaver or a life-taker,'' said Michael Maher, president of the
Trial Lawyers of America.
   Schering-Plough, the leading manufacturer of prescription
theophylline products, called the lawyers' action a ``self-serving
publicity campaign'' that will unduly alarm asthma patients and
interfere with doctor-patient relationships ``by overstating ad
overdramatizing the known risks of theophylline.''
   Company officials said their theophylline products have had a
good safety record. With more than 60 million prescriptions written
in the past five years, adverse reactions amounted to 1.3 per
100,000 prescriptions, said David Pernock, a company marketing
executive.
   He noted that Schering-Plough does not make any nonprescription
theophylline products because it agrees that ``it is a drug that
should be monitored.''
   The Food and Drug Administration banned over-the-counter sales
of theophylline as a single-ingredient product in 1986. Two years
ago, the agency proposed a ban on other nonprescription uses of the
drug.
   The lawyers' group last week sent a letter to the Food and Drug
Administration saying it knew of 26 preventable
theophylline-related incidents of death or serious injury since
1975.
   About 10 million Americans, most of them children, suffer from
asthma, which causes about 5,000 deaths a year.
   Though not a cure, theophylline, a chemical cousin of caffeine,
is the most widely prescribed remedy to ease breathing and has been
on the market for more than 40 years.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains, Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today on
news of the United States' third-quarter economic performance,
while profit-taking pushed share prices lower.
   The dollar closed at 129.35 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's
129.00-yen finish. It opened at 129.37 yen and ranged between
128.88 yen and 129.70 yen.
   The U.S. currency was strong in early trading after news of the
third quarter's 1.8 percent growth in U.S. gross national product,
higher than anticipated, dealers said.
   It weakened later on profit-taking, but rose again on reports of
a senior U.S. Treasury official expressing wariness over the
dollar's decline, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It is no longer that easy to push the dollar lower,'' the
dealer said.
   The dollar had fallen 13.55 yen in 13 trading days, closing at
124.40 yen on Oct. 18. It has mainly advanced since then, however.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
48.30 points, or 0.19 percent, closing at 25,194.10. In thin
trading, volume totaled 400 million shares on the first section,
unchanged from Tuesday.
   The index rose about 200 points, but then sank following a fall
in government bond prices, traders said.
   The index slipped mainly because of large-scale profit-taking
following early gains, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New
Japan Securities Co.
   ``Nomura Securities was trying to push up the Nikkei by
index-linked buying, because today was the last trading day in
October, but that invited more profit-taking,'' Nomura said.
   The index's early gains were in reaction to an overnight gain in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York and the yen's relative
stability against the dollar despite the better-than-expected U.S.
GNP, brokers said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 84.60 points from Tuesday's close
of 84.84. Their yield rose to 7.790 percent from 7.735 percent.

<HEAD>Sentencing Judge Says Some Jurors Determined to Acquit Mayor Barry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge who sentenced Mayor Marion
Barry to six months in jail on a misdemeanor cocaine possession
conviction says he believes four jurors were determined to acquit
Barry and misled the court during jury selection.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also told a Harvard
Law School forum on Tuesday that he had ``never seen a stronger
government'' case against a defendant.
   He remarks in Cambridge, Mass., were reported by The Washington
Post
   Meanwhile, Former District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice
Turner said Tuesday that Barry was the target of undercover drug
operations other than the one that led to his trial and conviction.
   ``There were several aggressive grand juries that were seated,
and there were stings that didn't materialize,'' Turner, now a
Republican mayoral candidate, said during a campaign forum on
WJLA-TV.
   Turner declined to provide details on the sting operations
against Barry, which he first mentioned in response to a question
about whether he would have approved such a tactic against his
then-boss.
   ``The stings were field operations, and I don't want to go into
it,'' Turner said. ``I do approve of sting operations, though.''
   Turner, who served 32 years on the police force with the last
eight as chief, added that he would not have ``sacrificed my career
for someone using drugs.''
   The former chief declined to say whether the operations were
coordinated with federal officials or whether his department was
acting alone.
   Jackson told the law students at Harvard that he thought the
evidence against Barry was ``overwhelming'' on 10 of 14 counts,
even though the mayor was convicted on only one count.
   He said four jurors ``obviously did not tell the truth'' when
they said during jury selection that they would approach the case
without bias.
   It is unusual, but not necessarily improper, for judges to
comment about cases that are no longer pending before them, legal
experts said Tuesday.
   If Barry's conviction is overturned on appeal, Jackson would
have to withdraw from any retrial because of his opinion about
Barry's guilt, the experts said. But his comments apparently do not
supply Barry with ammunition in his expected appeal of his
conviction, they said.
   ``I am not happy with the way the jury addressed the case,''
Jackson said at the forum. ``Some people on the jury .... had their
own agendas. They would not convict under any circumstances.''

   China's one-child policy hasn't worked as well as
hoped, officials said today as they released census figures showing
China has 1.133 billion people - 20 million more than anticipated.
   The discovery, the result of a door-to-door headcount in July
that was the biggest ever conducted in the world, is the equivalent
of finding that the entire population of Australia had been
overlooked among China's masses.
   ``Our planners overestimated their capacity to control the
population,'' Zhang Sai, director general of the State Statistics
Bureau, told a news conference.
   ``If we look at the absolute figure of 20 million, it is equal
to the total population of a province,'' he said, trying to explain
why these people had been missed before. ``But if we take into
account the large size of the population, it amounts to only 1.8
percent, so it is not that big.''
   The figure of 1.133 billion also could be under by several
million, however, because a random recount in sample areas showed
those areas were undercounted by 0.6 percent, according to
preliminary data released today.
   China already has a strict family planning policy that sets the
goal of one child per couple. Most cities enforce that strictly,
and couples that dare to have a second child face steep fines,
dismissal from work and explusion from the Communist Party.
   But in many rural areas, because of peasants' desire for boys to
work in the fields, local authorities have allowed couples to have
two children if the first is a girl. In other areas, officials have
tolerated large families because they, too, want many children or
have set fines that well-off peasants can easily pay.
   Many children born outside the official plan were not registered
with authorities before the census.
   Zhang said he did not know of any proposal to stiffen penalties
for extra births in light of the census results.
   He and other census officials at the news conference expressed
confidence that most unregistered babies, nicknamed ``black
babies'' because their existence is a dark secret, have now been
reported.
   But even journalists for China's state-run media expressed
skepticism, mindful of recent rumors that the census actually found
the population to be 1.38 billion or higher.
   ``Aren't your figures conservative?'' one asked. Another
reporter asked if it wasn't possible, given the widespread
corruption in Chinese bureaucracy, that some officials deliberately
falsified results.
   Zhang denied both charges.
   ``We followed statisticians' ethics, which says to `seek truth
from facts,''' he said, using a slogan made popular by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
   ``We believe the results of the census, having undergone
double-checking, basically reflect the actual situation,'' he said.
``Minor mistakes in calculation could lead to an error of hundreds
of millions. We understand that even a minor mistake in our work
would have a very serious impact on government policy.''
   Zhang said the population is likely to continue growing by 15
million to 17 million people annually through 1996 because of a
peak in the number of women of childbearing age.
   In other other results, the census found:
   -Men outnumber women 106.6 to 100, reflecting the continued
preference for boys over girls. The government has acknowledged
that killing of newborn girls continues in some rural areas, and
that in cities some women take tests to learn the sex of their
fetuses and abort girls.
   -More than 2.6 percent of people at census time were living
illegally outside the village or city where they were registered,
resulting in a ``floating population'' of more than 29 million
people. China tries to keep peasants from moving to cities and
blames illegal migrants for the rising crime rate, among other
problems.
   -More than 180 million people, or nearly 16 percent of the
population, were classed illiterate or semi-literate, down from
nearly 230 million at the last census in 1982.

   A satellite that will allow people
aboard ships, planes and trains to fax documents and place
telephone calls orbited Earth today after a smooth ride into space
on a Delta rocket.
   The unmanned 125-foot rocket roared into a cloudy, moonlit sky
on time at 6:16 p.m. Tuesday.
   The $80 million satellite separated from the booster as planned
less than an hour later and settled into an elliptical orbit 22,300
miles high. Engines aboard the spacecraft were to give it a
circular path over the next day or so.
   The 1{-ton satellite is owned by the International Maritime
Satellite Organization, or Inmarsat.
   The London-based organization has more than 12,000 computer
terminals in use around the world, most of them aboard ships. Each
terminal is connected to an antenna that allows it to receive and
send signals via satellite.
   The satellite is the first of four to be placed in orbit by the
end of 1991 to accommodate hundreds of thousands of Inmarsat
subscribers in the next decade, said Ahmad Ghais, Inmarsat director
of engineering and operations.
   Inmarsat's first airborne terminal was installed in a United
Airlines jet a week ago, Ghais said. More United terminals are
expected to come on line soon.
   ``Anyone on the go should be able to use our satellites to
communicate anywhere on Earth,'' Ghais said.
   Inmarsat, a cooperative of 62 countries, currently depends on
eight satellites owned by other organizations.
   The new spacecraft, built by British Aerospace, will have a
working lifetime of 10 years.
   The cost of the entire venture - satellite, launch and ground
tracking equipment - is estimated at $160 million.
   Tuesday's launch is believed to be the first time a U.S. company
has launched a satellite partly owned by the Soviets, said
Stephanie Lee-Miller, director of the Transportation Department's
Office of Commercial Space Transportation.
   The United States is the largest shareholder of Inmarsat,
followed by Britain and Norway. The Soviet Union is the
sixth-largest shareholder.
   It was the 200th launch by a Delta, more than any other U.S.
rocket. The first Delta was launched in 1960.

<HEAD>At Least 45 Opposition Members Reported Arrested in Burma
Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers have arrested
at least 45 opposition officials in a major crackdown on dissent
that began with raids on Buddhist monasteries last week, sources in
Burma said today.
   Those held included members of the Parliament elected in the May
27 national elections that the government has refused to honor,
said the sources contacted by telephone in Burma's capital,
Rangoon.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most were
members of the National League for Democracy, which won the
elections by a landslide.
   One source said the numbers of detainees ``are changing all the
time because people are being taken in for questioning and then
released. But we can say for certain that at least 45 have been
arrested and kept inside.''
   The government has not announced any of the arrests.
   Sources in the National League For Democracy said last week that
12 of its officials, including four members of the party's central
executive committee, were arrested on Oct. 23. Two other committee
members were arrested earlier, so just four of the body's 10
members are free.
   The party's two leaders, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, have been
detained for more than a year.
   The sources said most people were arrested in Rangoon, but
others were being held in the country's second largest city,
Mandalay, in the town of Moulmein about 100 miles southeast of
Rangoon, and in Taungoo, about 100 miles north of the capital.
   Several were members of the Democratic Party for New Society, a
student-led group close to the National League For Democracy, they
said.
   The members of Parliament who were detained included the
representative of the Co Co Islands in the Andaman Sea, south of
Rangoon. The islands are a military garrison, almost entirely
populated by military personnel. They nevertheless elected a
National League candidate.
   The crackdown began Oct. 22 when troops raided monasteries in
Mandalay. They moved after monks stopped ministering to soldiers
after troops suppressed a demonstration, reportedly killing two
monks and two other people.
   Authorities extended the raids to offices of the National League
for Democracy and closed down some of the offices.
   The political sources said up to 50 monks were detained in the
raids, but it was still unclear if the army had succeeded in
forcing the monks to end their boycott.
   There were reports that monks in at least one Rangoon monastery
were continuing it, one source said.
   The source said it would be difficult to break the boycott. He
said groups of monks as large as 500 had entered into compacts to
go on with the boycott, and these could be undone only if all those
who took the vow were reassembled.
   In many monasteries, abbots had sent monks home before troops
moved in, he said: ``It looks as if the military action has been
largely cosmetic.''
   Official Radio Rangoon on Tuesday quoted Mandalay commander,
Maj. Gen. Tun Kyi, as saying registration cards should be issued to
all monks as soon as possible.
   The military government of Gen. Saw Maung seized power in 1988
by crushing a nationwide uprising for democracy that sought to end
more than a quarter century of repressive authoritarian rule.

   A 16-year-old U.S. Justice Department lawsuit
accusing Louisiana of operating segregated colleges has been thrown
out by a federal judge.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz on Tuesday cited a federal
appeals court ruling last month in a similar case from Mississippi.
He said he disagreed with that ruling but that it was binding in
the Louisiana case.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Casner said Tuesday said
officials had not decided whether to appeal.
   The department was the remaining party in the 1974 case.
   Black leaders lost enthusiasm for the lawsuit when a three-judge
panel endorsed a plan that would have abolished predominantly black
Southern University's board of supervisors as part of a remedy for
alleged segregation.
   The Louisiana higher-education system consists of 17 colleges
and universities and 138,000 students.
   Schwartz's ruling cited a decision in September by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeal that said Mississippi's similar college
system is not intentionally segregated and has an open admissions
policy.
   Louisiana also has long had an open admissions policy, but
Southern and Grambling State universities remain almost all black.
Blacks are a minority at Louisiana State University and seven other
major colleges.
   Southern dropped its support of the lawsuit last year. Grambling
took no position on the case, although Grambling alumni agreed with
Southern that higher education was no longer segregated.

<HEAD>Diplomat Says Vietnam Willing To Host Permanent U.S. Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diplomat in the Thai capital said
today that Vietnam is willing to allow the United States to base in
Hanoi an official who would seek information on Americans missing
from the Vietnam war.
   There was no immediate official confirmation from Hanoi on what
would be the first American post in the Vietnamese capital since
the northern-based Communists defeated the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   Hanoi, eager to expand trade ties and end its political
isolation, is seeking to normalize relations with Washington.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the idea
of stationing an official in Hanoi was discussed at an Oct. 17
meeting in Washington.
   The diplomat said John W. Vessey, a special U.S. presidential
envoy on Vietnamese humanitarian issues, and Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach attended the meeting.
   The diplomat quoted Thach as saying Tuesday in Bangkok that
Vietnam accepted the idea. Thach spoke at the end of a three-day
visit to Thailand.
   Two U.S. Embassy officials, also speaking anonymously, said
today that they knew of no firm agreement and it did not appear an
official would be sent to Hanoi anytime soon.
   In Washington on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said the United States, hoping to expand joint activities
on the issue of missing soldiers, previously had broached the idea
of an office in Vietnam but the Vietnamese declined.
   In the recent Thach-Vessey meeting, she said, both sides agreed
that the United States soon would send a technical team to Hanoi
and form a joint team of military experts to improve the search for
information.
   She added: ``There was also discussion that should these efforts
produce results that would justify the on-going presence of a
technical POW-MIA (Prisoner of War, Missing In Action) team in
Hanoi, we would seriously consider sending such a team, at first on
a temporary basis.''
   The Vietnamese previously said that if the United States were to
open an MIA office in Hanoi, Vietnam should be allowed to open a
representation in Washington. It was not clear if this remained
their position.
   Some U.S. officials are stationed in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon, to process people seeking to emigrate to the
United States under the Orderly Departure Program.
   About 2,300 Americans are reported missing in action from the
Vietnam War, about 1,700 of them on Vietnamese soil. From Sept.
15-25, American Army forensic experts examined remains in Ho Chi
Minh City that the Vietnamese said they found. Results of that
examination were not available.
   Vietnam badly needs ties with the United States to end its
diplomatic isolation and bring in funds for the impoverished
economy.
   The climate for relations between the two countries has improved
since Vietnam in September 1989 staged a major troop pullout from
Cambodia's civil war and began efforts to seek a political solution
to the conflict.

<HEAD>Former U.N. Ambassador Says U.S. Options Include Air Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick says the
United States has more options against Iraq than just economic
embargo or an all-out ground war.
   Selective air strikes, for example.
   American air attacks against Iraqi military targets are a ``very
good option,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick told the 56th annual convention of
the Associated Press Managing Editors on Tuesday, the first day of
the four-day meeting.
   ``I can imagine action that would combine American aerial
strikes and Arab ground operations, for example,'' said Ms.
Kirkpatrick, professor of political science at Georgetown
University. ``I think these are at least alternatives that are more
likely than U.S. participation in some sort of large ground war.''
   Saddam Hussein said Tuesday that Iraq was making final
preparations for war and expected an attack within days by the
United States and its allies.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick said it would be dangerous to let Saddam keep
parts of Kuwait.
   Saddam would see partial withdrawal as a victory and become more
desirous of occupying neighboring countries, particularly Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, she said.
   `Saddam Hussein is an aggressive man who already has used force
and the threat of force against every one of his neighbors,'' Ms.
Kirkpatrick said. ``If he had rewards from this aggression ... I
have no doubt that he would move on.''
   Former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, who also addressed the
convention, said intense scrutiny of political candidates will
continue and overall is beneficial, so long as the media practices
``fairness to the max.''
   ``I suspect what we're in for is a future where this kind of
scrutiny becomes the order of the day,'' Cisneros said.
   He said openness carries a price.
   ``There will be no heroes, because there are no perfect
people,'' he said, and ``we're going to scare some people off.''
   Cisneros, who decided against a third term in 1989, denied that
the revelation of an extramarital affair ran him out of office. He
said he decided to leave because of financial pressures worsened by
his son's ill health.

<HEAD>Strike Leader Charged With Sedition; New Walkout Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today charged the
nation's most prominent labor leader with inciting sedition in
connection with unrest during last week's crippling nationwide
strike.
   Crispin Beltran, leader of the leftist May First Movement, was
also charged with illegal assembly. The charges stem from Beltran's
behavior at a rally in front of the Senate when the four-day
walkout began on Oct. 24.
   About two dozen vehicles were destroyed in strike-related
violence.
   Nick Elman, the movement's spokesman, said the labor group will
not be cowed by the arrest. He said the movement was finalizing
plans for another general strike but did not say when it will be
called or what the demands were.
   The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, the country's
biggest labor federation, which did not join the strike, deplored
the arrest and urged the government to release Beltran.
   Beltran, 57, denied government charges that he called on people
to overthrow President Corazon Aquino and he said he will clear his
organization of alleged links to the Communist underground.
   ``I welcome this opportunity in order first of all to vindicate
myself and the leadership of the (Movement) and assert our legality
and legitimacy,'' Beltran said. ``We had nothing to do with the
violence and we have no linkages with the underground movement.''
   He said there were ``unseen hands behind the scenes''
responsible for an evident crackdown against strike leaders and the
death of a strike leader on Monday.
   Beltran also asked authorities ``to take it easy on their
charges and malicious imputations against us.''
   The labor leader, whose movement claims 750,000 members, would
face a maximum six-year sentence if convicted of sedition.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Beltran also had been charged
in a court in Toledo City in the central Philippines, where 10,000
workers walked out of the Atlas Consolidated Mining Corp., Asia's
largest copper producer, during the strike. He did not specify the
charge.
   Militants, believed to include Communist rebels, burned 23
buses, passenger jeeps and other vehicles during the labor unrest.
Such attacks had not taken place during previous strikes.
   On the day before the walkout, unknown assailants killed the
leader of a transport federation, Oscar Lazaro, who had refused to
join the strike.
   Beltran was arrested late Tuesday after he and Manila police
chief Col. Ernesto Diokno appeared on television to discuss the
strike.
   During the program, Diokno said police had been looking for
Beltran since the strike because he allegedly had made seditious
statements. Beltran had been in hiding until appearing on the
program.
   Beltran was later led to a police car and driven to the Western
Police District headquarters.
   Last week's strike was the most extensive since President Aquino
took office in February 1986 in the ``people power revolution''
that toppled the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The strike, called to demand a 42 percent increase in the $3.56
daily minimum wage, paralyzed public transport in Manila and other
cities.
   It ended Saturday without a settlement. The government rejected
the demanded pay increase but granted an increase of 68 cents, or
19 percent, for Manila area workers. Inflation is running at 12.1
percent annually nationwide, 16.7 percent in the capital.
   Beltran's arrest was expected to increase tension between the
Aquino government and organized labor. The government has said the
strike was Communist-run, although the May First Movement denies
the claim.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will meet
Secretary of State James A. Baker III next week in Geneva to
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis and disarmament, the independent
news agency Interfax reported today.
   It said they would meet on Nov. 8-9. Soviet television said the
meeting would occur Nov. 9 but that its location was undetermined.
   The meeting will mark another chapter in the historic
cooperation between the superpowers that began when Baker met
Shevardnadze in the Siberian city of Irkutsk. During that session,
the ministers learned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had invaded
Kuwait.
   The two directed officials to prepare a joint statement
condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal. It was the
first time since World War II the superpowers agreed on a common
position in a major regional conflict.
   Both countries have been sending diplomats around the world to
try to defuse the crisis.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, has
been touring the Middle East to try to find a peaceful solution to
the conflict.
   Baker, meanwhile, leaves the United States this weekend for
Saudi Arabia, other Middle Eastern countries and Europe to discuss
the crisis.
   Interfax, quoting Foreign Ministry sources, said that in
addition to discussing the crisis, Shevardnadze and Baker will talk
about cuts in strategic nuclear weapons and conventional arms.
   The Soviet Union has repeatedly ruled out the use of military
force to drive Saddam's troops out of Kuwait, while the United
States has built up its forces in the Persian Gulf region to
220,000 troops.
   President Bush has warned the United States would not hesitate
to use force if provoked, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
last week that 100,000 more troops may be deployed in the region.
   Many countries have hostages in Kuwait and Iraq, including those
used as human shields at potential military targets, and Gorbachev
has warned they may be endangered by any use of force by Saddam's
opponents.

<TEXT>
   A ban on the use of wood stoves and fireplaces
will go into effect in Denver on days when the air looks cruddy,
not just when the carbon monoxide gauges say it is.
   The new regulations go into effect Thursday. The restrictions on
burning wood are not new; Denver has had them for years. It's the
criteria for determining when to impose the restrictions that are
being changed.
   Previously, the restrictions went into effect when carbon
monoxide exceeded federal levels. But officials got tired of
getting complaints they were not doing enough to eliminate the
pollution that hangs over the city during winter.
   ``We had a credibility problem,'' John Leary, deputy director of
the air pollution control division of the state Health Department,
said Tuesday. ``We'd say there was no high pollution day, and
people would look out and it looked terrible.''
   It conducted a survey, asking 200 people chosen at random to
look at slides and decide which showed dirty air.
   ``We urged people to consider that they live in an urban area,
and not to expect the pristine air, not what they would find in a
national park. There was remarkable agreement, and at that point a
standard was set,'' Leary said.
   They agreed that the air is polluted even when 93.6 percent of a
beam of light gets through a kilometer of air, far tougher than
federal standards.
   A pollution alert triggers a wood-burning ban that should idle
most wood-burning stoves and fireplaces. Smoke from wood fires
plays a significant role in Denver visibility, which gets dirty
brown air in the winter.
   Violators of a pollution alert can be fined $25 or more for
repeat offenses.

   Rival Shiite Moslem factions agreed today
to end their bloody 3-year power struggle, which has claimed the
lives of more than 1,100 people.
   Also today, the government of President Elias Hrawi announced
that the four principal Moslem and Christian militias who fought a
15-year-old civil war that left 150,000 dead have agreed to move
out of Beirut.
   Efforts to end factional fighting accelerated after Syria, with
an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon, helped the government crush
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's 11-month-old mutiny on Oct. 13.
   The two Shiite militias - the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and Syrian-backed Amal - issued a joint communique today
saying a ``comprehensive cease-fire'' in their confrontation began
at midnight Tuesday.
   The communique said representatives of the two factions would
``work out a plan for the exchange of prisoners pending the
achievement of a comprehensive and final settlement (to the
conflict) under the auspices of Syria and Iran.''
   Hezbollah is the umbrella group for kidnappers believed holding
13 Western hostages, including six Americans.
   Shiite sources have said Hezbollah moved the hostages out of the
south Beirut slums before the crackdown on Aoun, anticipating they
would lose their strongholds in the capital as the government
implemented its peace plan.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   The cease-fire, the latest in a series of agreements aimed at
containing the inter-Shiite bloobath, climaxed a series of meetings
of senior commanders from both sides. Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan,
commander of the Syrian army's military intelligence in Lebanon,
chaired the talks.
   The meetings at Kenaan's office in the east Lebanon's town of
Anjar were also attended by Iran's ambassador to Syria, Mohammad
Akhtari.
   Police said no truce violations were reported in Beirut, south
or east Lebanon where both sides have bases.
   The particularly tense Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, which
had witnessed some of the bloodiest rounds of the Hezbollah-Amal
war, was quiet.
   But a police spokesman, who spoke anonymously in line with
regulations, said fighters of both factions maintained positions
facing each other in the disputed mountain terrain above the
southern port city of Sidon.
   Hezbollah and Amal, vying for mastery of the 1.2 million Shiites
in Lebanon, have fought intermittently since June 1987. By police
count, 1,100 people have been killed and 3,222 wounded in the
struggle.
   Both Amal and Hezbollah have been among the four militias to
agree to the militia-free greater Beirut plan. The other two are
the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces and the Druse Progressive
Socialist Party.
   ``We break the good news to the Lebanese citizens who are
longing for peace. The Lebanese Forces militia reacted positively
to the government plan for the creation of the greater Beirut,''
Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul announced after a five-hour
meeting with Samir Geagea, the militia's leader.
   The session also was attended by Defense Minister Albert
Mansour.
   Hrawi had assigned Dalloul, a Shiite, and Mansour, a Greek
Catholic, to discuss the greater Beirut plan with militia leaders
and work out details of the withdrawals.
   ``All the militias have agreed to withdraw from greater
Beirut,'' Dalloul told reporters. No deadline has been set for the
pullout.
   The proposed greater Beirut extends along a 15-mile stretch from
the Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the south and
covers the city's eastern and southeastern suburbs.
   The government peace plan also aims to give equal political
power to Christians and Moslems, effectively shifting power to the
Moslem majority.
   Until recently, Christians had maintained political dominance
despite their declining demographic strength.

   Eileen Stevens estimates 50 college students
have died from fraternity hazing since her son was a victim in
1978.
   ``You send a young man off to college, you expect him to come
home, not to be put through torturous or humiliating
circumstances,'' said Ms. Stevens, founder of the Committee to Halt
Useless College Killings.
   The group's acronym, CHUCK, serves as a reminder of her son,
Chuck Stenzel.
   A pledge at a fraternity at Alfred University in New York,
Stenzel died of an alcohol overdose during an initiation, according
to a coroner's report. Ms. Stevens, of Sayville, N.Y., settled a
$64 million lawsuit out of court and began her campaign to abolish
hazing.
   She travels frequently, visiting campuses or speaking at
seminars such as the annual Fraternal Law Conference in Cincinnati.
   About 100 people, mostly lawyers who represent fraternities in
lawsuits, are expected at the conference here Friday and Saturday.
National and student fraternity leaders and university officials
also are invited.
   They will look at hazing, alcohol abuse, date rape, racial
discrimination and other problems facing fraternities.
   Cases persist in which fraternity members require prospective
members to perform degrading acts before granting them membership.
But fewer incidents have been reported in recent years as national
fraternities banned hazing, colleges cracked down and more states
passed anti-hazing laws, Ms. Stevens said.
   ``Statistically, there appear to be a couple of fatalities a
year, but I don't believe that's accurate,'' said Ms. Stevens, who
monitors news reports for hazing incidents. ``Many deaths are
listed as accidents, others go unreported and the victims are
rarely autopsied.''
   Her estimate of 50 hazing deaths since 1978 is accepted by the
Indianapolis-based National Interfraternity Conference, the
sanctioning body for 59 national fraternities, their 5,275 chapters
and 400,000 members on 810 campuses in the United States and
Canada.
   Last October, Morehouse College in Atlanta suspended a chapter
following the death of a pledge who allegedly was shoved when he
failed to answer correctly questions posed by fraternity members.
   In 1986, a fraternity at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter,
Minn., was disbanded after members used silver nitrate to burn the
fraternity insignia on the backs of pledges.
   Hazing isn't limited to fraternities, Ms. Stevens said.
   ``Certainly it goes on in the military, in sports, even school
bands,'' she said.
   After an incident last December in which a woman student was
handcuffed to a urinal, the U.S. Naval Academy revised its rules
for disciplining any midshipman found guilty of physical abuse of
freshmen, even if the act falls short of what is considered hazing.
   Thirty states have anti-hazing laws, according to Fraternal Law,
a newsletter distributed by Manley, Burke &amp; Fisher, the Cincinnati
law firm that organizes the Fraternal Law Conference.
   A certain amount of indoctrination is considered important to
cohesiveness in college fraternities, as in military academies. But
the conference says national fraternities have tried to eliminate
the old-fashioned, mean-spirited tasks and the sort of forced,
heavy drinking that resulted in Chuck Stenzel's death.
   Ms. Stevens agrees, citing steps by fraternities to offer
alternatives such as public service projects to take the place of
``Hell Week'' initiations.
   ``Every college campus I visit - and I've been to a dozen this
semester already - I think there is a change ... things like
alcohol awareness weeks and dry rushes, where fraternities
entertain prospective members without alcohol being present,'' she
said.

   The dollar was steady today in quiet European
trading following better than expected U.S. growth figures released
Tuesday.
   Gold prices rose slightly.
   The U.S. Gross National Product, the total output of goods and
services, rose by 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 1990, sharply
above analysts' forecasts of a 0.9 percent rise.
   ``Who's to say if those figures were merely the U.S.'s swan song
or an indication that the economy isn't as troubled as we think,''
a dealer in Milan said today.
   ``In any case, the economy is going to benefit from (President)
Bush's decision to send more troops to the Middle East,'' the
trader said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.35 yen, up 0.35 yen from
Tuesday's finish. Later in London, it was quoted at 129.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   -1.5193 German marks, up from 1.5190
   -1.2885 Swiss francs, down from 1.2890

   -1.1700 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1668
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9425, compared
with $1.9485 late Tuesday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommeded gold price of
$379.25 per ounce at midmorning, up from $375.50 bid per ounce late
Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $379.65, up from $373.40 late

   For the first time in more than a month,

<TEXT>
   Hindus and Moslems fought with knives and
guns in scattered violence today, leaving at least seven more
people dead, and more troops were sent to guard a disputed holy
site in this northeastern city.
   The dispute over the site has pushed the government to the brink
of collapse and violence stemming from it has left at least 158
people dead in the past week. On Tuesday night, the violence spread
to neighboring Bangladesh.
   Troops killed five people and wounded at least 20 in Ayodhya on
Tuesday when thousands of Hindu militants broke through police
barricades and forced their way to a 460-year-old mosque they want
to replace with a Hindu temple.
   Hindu fundamentalists had vowed to start construction Tuesday on
a temple to the Hindu god Rama on the site, which they revere as
the god's birthplace.
   The fundamentalists say the mosque should be razed to make way
for a Hindu temple in this holy town 300 miles southeast of New
Delhi. Hindus make up 82 percent of India's population. Moslems
comprise 12 percent.
   At least 45 people died in street battles Tuesday and today in
six states, mostly in cities with large Moslem minorities, as the
decades-old Hindu-Moslem dispute over the ownership of the site
came to a head.
   One Hindu man committed suicide Tuesday in protest.
   Today's deaths, from stabbings and shootings, occurred in what
Indian news agencies described as mob violence in four widely
separated cities in western and southern India. Indian news reports
do not identify victims or give many details, in the belief that
doing so would aggravate tensions.
   In Bangladesh, gangs of Moslems armed with knives or clubs
attacked at least 11 Hindu temples and smashed idols in the
southern port of Chittagong Tuesday night to protest the Ayodhya
episode. Hundreds of Hindu homes and shops were burned, but no
injuries were reported.
   Police imposed a curfew on the city at dawn today. No injuries
or arrests were reported.
   The Ayodhya dispute has has brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
government to the verge of collapse.
   Authorities deployed additional troops around the disputed
shrine today and blocked the bridge across the sacred Saryu River,
where 6,000 Hindus had gathered..
   The devotees sat in the fields opposite the town and sang hymns,
and the anger of the previous day seemed to have eased.
   Tuesday's widespread violence prompted Singh to renew an offer
to resign. Singh's 11-month-old coalition lost its majority in
Parliament last week when an allied right-wing Hindu party withdrew
support over the temple issue.
   Singh has been under mounting pressure from dissidents in his
party to quit. He faces a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on
Nov. 7, and his letter offering to step down seemed to presuppose
that the government will lose.
   ``All energies should be directed to diffuse the situation and
maintain communal harmony. It is in the pursuit of these goals that
we have sacrificed a whole government,'' he wrote to the president
of his Janata Dal party.
   ``My conscience is clear that I have sacrificed the highest
office for the cause of unity of the country and the oppressed,''
he wrote.
   The letter was dismissed by the Janata Dal dissidents as an
attempt by Singh to rally his supporters. The party is to meet
early next week to decide the leadership question.
   Most political analysts predict elections within a few months
and a possible return to government by former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's Congress Party, which governed India for all but four of
its 43 years of independence.
   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence last
year after the Hindu group announced its plans to replace the
mosque with a temple.

   An American reconnaissance satellite written
off by the Soviets and others as an expensive failure apparently is
alive and spying after all.
   First, three men in Europe separately spotted it orbiting 503
miles high. Then a computer programmer in Canada followed a trail
of mathematical clues to the conclusion that the object is the
satellite launched from the shuttle Atlantis on March 1.
   It apparently has been there all along, said Ted Molczan of
Toronto, who took the observations of three other satellite
observers and tracked its course backward to the hush-hush launch.
   The Atlantis mission was secret and all the Pentagon said about
it was that it achieved its goal. Whether that referred to a safe
shuttle flight or a new operational spy satellite was left to
conjecture.
   The Soviet news agency Novosti reported March 7 that four
orbiting fragments, ``presumably separated from the American spy
satellite,'' were spotted in orbit. The agency said it assumed
``the spy satellite has been blown up by its owners for some
unknown reasons.''
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams replied only that two
parts ``associated with'' the payload had entered Earth's
atmosphere and burned up and ``the remainder are expected to decay
within two to seven weeks.''
   The reappearance of the satellite was first reported by Florida
Today, a daily newspaper published in Melbourne, Fla., which said
``the $500 million photo reconnaissance satellite ... appears to be
carryig out its mission to spy on the Soviet Union.''
   Molczan said the object was spotted independently by three
European observers, Russell Eberst of Scotland, Daniel Karcher,
whose location he did not know, and Pierre Meirinck of France.
   He gave this sequence of events:
   Eberst, who has been a satellite observer for nearly 30 years,
saw the object with binoculars on Oct. 9, took measurements ``and
for the time being, that was that.''
   Karcher saw the object on Oct. 12 and Meirinck saw it on Oct.
14. Each took precise measurements.
   Eberst and Meirinck were chatting on the telephone and Eberst
mentioned his observation. They learned of Karcher's observation.
Their analysis showed that all three observed the same satellite on
different nights.
   ``My role was to take my knowledge of secret launches and see if
what they saw matched with any of them,'' Molczan said. The object
was orbiting at a relatively high inclination, 65 degrees from the
equator.
   Molczan said he has data on anything the Soviets launch and the
object didn't fit. He then considered six possibilities of American
launches, eliminating them one by one before tracing the satellite
back to the March launch.
   Molczan, who has a group of other amateurs in the north
reporting to him, said other facts strengthen his belief that what
is being seen is the spy satellite.
   He believes the satellite was boosted into a higher orbit and
three degrees higher in inclination on March 7. The orbiting
fragments the Soviets spotted that day may have been shrouds or
other protective covers.
   Molczan said the satellite repeats its track every nine days,
common for satellites designed for Earth observation. He said he
believes it takes digital images that then are transmitted to
ground stations.
   Major advances in optics would enable the satellite to see well
even from an altitude of 503.9 miles, Molczan said, and it could
stay at that distance from Earth for many years, without much need
for fuel to correct its course.
   And why did the object disappear for so long?
   Molczan said the unusual change in orbital inclination would
make the satellite difficult to follow. It turned out, by looking
at records, that Eberst and Karcher had tracked and recorded the
object in June, but Molczan said he and others were busy following
a Titan-launched satellite and ``it fell through the cracks.''

   Gangs of Moslems, many armed with
knives and clubs, atacked Hindu temples, smashed idols and set
fire to hundreds of homes in response to clashes in India,
witnesses said today.
   Angry mobs took to the streets late Tuesday on hearing news of
an attempt by fundamentalist Hindus in India to take over a mosque
and replace it with a temple at the holy town of Ayodhya. More than
150 people have been killed in India in fighting related to the
dispute.
   In Bangladesh, police fired rifles in the air to disperse crowds
and clamped an indefinite curfew on the city of Chittagong. Police
said they arrested 10 people in one incident, but witnesses said
they saw police take away 35 people after a separate confrontation.
   A crowd of about 100 people defied the curfew imposed at dawn
today and assaulted a Hindu shrine. In all, at least 11 temples
have been broken into and vandalized since Tuesday, according to
officials and witnesses.
   The worst violence flared at Kaiballadham, site of the
Chittagong's largest temple. Witnesses said 2,000 people with
knives and iron rods rampaged through a residential disrict around
the temple at midnight and burned at least 300 houses.
   Police fired into the air to disperse a mob that was preventing
firemen from approaching the area. Sushil Gosh, one of 500
displaced people who set up a camp on a hill above the temple, said
four men were missing.
   Police also fired at Reazuddin Bazar and Chittagong Medical
College when mobs of up to 200 people tried to storm temples and
burn Hindu-owned stores.
   One group destroyed about 50 mud-and-straw houses inhabited by
low-caste Hindus, mainly fishermen. Another group attacked a garage
owned by a Hindu and damaged five vehicles.
   Police said about 1,500 Hindu fishermen at central Chowkbazar
district fled their homes during the night attack, but returned in
the morning when situation was brought under control.
   In Dhaka, the capital, tension heightened when about 1,000
Moslems marched on the Indian High Commission or embassy.
   Riot police halted the march three blocks from the embassy, but
a middle-aged man who appeared by his dress to be a Hindu was
beaten by the mob nearby, witnesses said.
   The authorities posted police guards at Dhaka's temples for fear
of attacks, but no violence was reported.
   When colonial Britain partitioned the Indian subcontinent in
1947, Hindus were left with an overwhelming majority in India.
Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, is 88 percent Moslem and 10
percent Hindu.

   A 17-year-old girl with a broken arm,
broken ankle and other injuries suffered when her car ran off the
road crawled for three days before passing motorists finally
spotted her.
   Jean Anne Kelleher underwent surgery late Tuesday in a
Shreveport hospital following her ordeal in which she also suffered
dehydration, exposure, multiple cuts and bruises.
   Miss Kelleher was spotted Tuesday afternoon by Leona and Hart
Clawson of Jefferson, Texas, when they saw her beside the road and
called Caddo Parish deputies for help.
   Miss Kelleher was driving home Saturday night when she swerved
to avoid a deer on state Highway 2, ran into a densely wooded area
near Oil City and was thrown from the car, said her mother, Debra
Kelleher.
   Mrs. Kelleher and her husband Harold reported their daughter
missing Sunday and started searching for her. She said the family
drove past the area where Jean Anne's car was wrecked more than 10
times while searching for her.
   A tree broken by the impact covered the car, deputies said.
   ``A lot of parents out there do not get the chance to have their

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact to Be Dissolved as Military Alliance by June</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact will cease existing as
a Soviet-led military alliance next year, more than 30 years after
it was formed to meet the threat of Western attack, a senior
Hungarian official said today.
   The official, who spoke to Western reporters, said the
``military aspect'' of the crumbling six-nation alliance would
effectively be suspended in December, with the cessation of joint
military exercises.
   The pact will be dissolved as a military alliance in June and
will continue to function ``only as a political forum,'' he added,
without elaboration.
   The Warsaw Pact was formed in 1955, in response to the creation
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a year earlier as the
Cold War gained force. The two alliances confronted each other
until Communist governments were swept from power across most of
East Europe last year.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, appeared to
be indirectly elaborating on past comments by leaders of newly
democratic East European countries, who have been pushing for a
transformation of the alliance to reflect new political realities.
   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia said last week that the
pact's military structure would be abolished. It will instead be
transformed into a body with a ``consultative political function,''
he said, according to CTK, the Czechoslovak state news agency.
   Havel gave no dates but said the ``essential transformation''
would be completed by a top-level Warsaw Pact meeting that was
originally slated for Saturday in Budapest but has been postponed
until after Nov. 19.
   That is when the 34 nations of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe will hold a summit in Paris. The nations are
set to sign a major East-West conventional arms reduction
agreement.
   Hungary has already served notice that it will leave the
military part of the Warsaw Pact next year if it is not dissolved
by then.
   On Saturday, Warsaw Pact ministers are to sign an agreement on
arms ceilings for each of the pact's six members, clearing the way
for the signing of the East-West arms pact in Paris.

   Ethnic Moldavians stormed border checkpoints early
today, threatening to kill border guards and their families unless
Soviet security forces withdraw, Tass reported.
   The more than 3,000 militants also set a fence on fire and threw
stones before being persuaded to leave the checkpoints on the
Romanian border, the official Soviet news agency said.
   It was the first report of violence in Moldavia since members of
the Gaguaz minority launched a drive to secede from the republic
earlier this month, and underscored the conflicts that have
mushroomed since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev loosened the
Kremlin's grip on ethnic groups.
   Moldavia is a microcosm of the Soviet Union's ethnic problems.
Of its 4.3 million people, some of the majority ethnic Moldavians
are demanding the republic secede from the Soviet Union and rejoin
Romania. The Gagauz minority, numbering about 150,000, wants to
secede from Moldavia.
   Today, the militants demanded the withdrawal of the Soviet
troops that were sent to the republic when a state of emergency was
declared last week.
   ``The militants pelted the Stoyanovka checkpoint with stones and
then set the fence around it on fire,'' Tass said. It appeared the
fence was made of wood. The report did not mention any casualties
in Stoyanovka, a town on the border with Romana.
   Moldavian leaders flew to the scene and persuaded the militants
to give up the two checkpoints they were blocking, Tass said
without providing details. The agency did not say if both
checkpoints were in Stoyanovka.
   The Gagauz claimed control over part of the republic earlier
this month and on Sunday planned elections for an autonomous
government. But ethnic Moldavians opposed the move, and the
elections were called off. The Kremlin dispatched troops to the
region, and imposed a state of emergency on Friday.
   Tass said the militants had been living in crowded conditions in
the Gagauz region and wanted the Interior Ministry troops replaced
with republic police.
   Tensions had been reported Tuesday to be easing, as talks
between the opposing sides were under way. But the legislature of
the Gagauz republic, which Moldavia's parliament declared
unconstitutional, elected a president later in the day. He is
Stepan Topal, a 52-year-old civil engineer.
   The militants threatened to ``wipe the border posts off the face
of the earth'' and then cross the border into Romania. They also
threatened to go to Kishinev ``to restore order,'' according to
Tass.
   The Moldavian Interior Ministry, reached by telephone in the
republic capital, Kishinev, declined comment on today's unrest.
   Moldavia's Communist Party Central Committee issued a statement
condemning use of ``power methods to solve national, political and
other conflicts by stirring up passions and mass psychosis.''
   It was the third reported incident on Moldavia's border with
Romania this year.
   Tens of thousands of Romanians and Moldavians forced open
several crossings in June on the anniversary of Moscow's annexation
of the region.
   The region, formerly known as Bessarabia, had been part of
Romania.
   In May, tens of thousands of Romanians streamed across eight
bridges on a border river for the first time in more than half a
century.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's `Had it' with Iraq's Treatment of Hostages</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with additional Bush
comments.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush declared today ``I have
had it'' with Iraq's treatment of U.S. hostages, but said he has no
timetable for deciding on a possible military strike.
   Bush, under pressure from Congress to allow more time for
economic sanctions against Iraq to work, said the United
Nations-led embargo has not been as effective as he had hoped.
   The president escalated the administration's anti-Iraq rhetoric
but said the harsh comments of the past few days from senior
officials should not be interpreted as a sign he had decided force
was the only way to resolve the gulf crisis.
   ``The embassy is being starved,'' Bush said of the U.S. embassy
in Kuwait where a handful of staff members are confined during the
Iraqi occupation. ``The people out there are not being resupplied.
The American flag is flying over the Kuwait embassy and our people
inside are being starved by a brutal dictator.''
   ``Do you think I'm concerned about it? You're darn right I am.
And what I`m going to do about it - let's just wait and see,
because I have had it with that kind of treatment of Americans,''
Bush said.
   The president made the comments to reporters after arriving in
suburban Virginia for a political campaign breakfast for Rep. Stan
Parris, R-Va.
   Asked if the hostages have become more important in his strategy
for how to deal with the Persian Gulf crisis, Bush replied, ``I
wouldn't say more, but I am very concerned about it.''
   The president responded with a blunt ``no'' when asked if he had
settled on a time frame for ordering a military strike.
   Bush gave a pessimistic assessment of the effects of the
economic sanctions, to date the major weapon of the U.S.-led
coalition demanding that Saddam Hussein pull his troops from
Kuwait.
   ``I wouldn't say they haven't been successful at all but they
certainly haven't driven demand to do what he should have done,
which was to get out of Kuwait and reverse this agression,'' Bush
said.
   A president must keep the safety of Americans ``foremost in his
mind,'' Bush said. Referring to the treatment of the Kuwait embassy
staff, he said: ``It has been brutal. It has been oppressive.''
   Nervous lawmakers have urged Bush to be patient and let the
international trade embargo against Iraq run its course before
using force.
   ``We're saying, play out the sanctions. See how long this
goes,'' Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said after he and other
congressional leaders met with Bush on Tuesday.
   ``The general thrust was, don't do anything unilaterally. If we
are going to proceed to ratchet this up, it should be under the
United Nations umbrella. Caution is the word here,'' said Fascell,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The meeting followed two days of tough talk by the president and
his top officials on the Persian Gulf crisis, which included
warnings that the United States would not hesitate to use force if
provoked.
   Fascell said Bush threw the meeting open to comments from his
guests, and was told: ``If there is a provocation, it's got to be a
real one. If there's an additional provocation, it can't be two
whales passing in the night. It has to be something that can stand
the scrutiny of the media and of the public and of history. He
understood.''
   Other lawmakers said the president talked a lot at the meeting
about the American and other hostages still being held in Kuwait
and Iraq, including those used as human shields at potential
military targets and personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City.
   Describing Bush's mood, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said ``his
patience is wearing thin.'' Yet, Cohen said, the president will
``continue to pursue the course that we're currently on.''
   Members of Congress, who adjourned their session for the year
early Sunday, are nervous that military action might be taken in
their absence. They point to the harsh rhetoric from Bush and
Baker, Baker's upcoming trip to Islamic and European countries, and
to stalemated efforts to find diplomatic solutions.
   ``There's concern on Capitol Hill ... that this is somehow a
prelude to immediate military action,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The congressional contingent asked that Bush make no major moves
without consulting Capitol Hill, noting that the Constitution
reserves to Congress the power to declare war.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush promised to
keep consultations open, but he added: ``We must all understand,
however, that any such commitment must be hedged, given the
unpredictable and dynamic circumstances of this crisis.''
   After consulting lawmakers, Bush also met with senior national
security advisers. Bush has sent some 240,000 troops to the gulf
region, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said last week that
100,000 more may be deployed.

   Tamara Skiba was 20 when she was sent to the
Kargopol labor camp in the Soviet north. By the time she got out
nine years and seven months later, she was an old woman.
   ``They broke my spine and took out my female organs. They ruined
one ear and pulled out almost all my teeth,'' she said, opening her
mouth to reveal withered gums and rows of false teeth.
   Mrs. Skiba, 63, was among an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 Soviets
who marched to the headquarters of the KGB security police on
Tuesday night for the unveiling of a monument to victims of
political repression.
   The daughter of a high-ranking army officer, she was arrested
and charged with spying for the West when her father fell out of
favor with Josef Stalin in 1947. A decade later, after Stalin's
death, she was released and rehabilitated - given a clean political
bill of health - by Premier Nikita Khrushchev.
   Mrs. Skiba's allegations of mistreatment could not be confirmed,
but medical care in the camps was often rudimentary, and survivors
have alleged that they suffered botched operations and serious
illnesses that could have been prevented.
   Tied around her gray hair on Tuesday was a white headband saying
``Kargopol.'' She carried a banner listing friends who died in the
camp, and marched with others whose relatives or friends perished
in the camps that dotted the Soviet hinterland from 1918 until
recently.
   Some marchers carried signs with the names of camps: Kolyma,
Mordovia, Karaganda.
   Others bore photographs of those who perished: Jozef Berman,
Alexander Nebov, the Kalina family.
   Holding candles against a bitter wind, they exchanged stories,
listened to speeches by reformist politicians and placed red and
white carnations on the monument outside the Lubyanka, the KGB
headquarters and former prison.
   ``This building is a symbol - a symbol of lawlessness,
inhumanity and illegality,'' historian Yuri Afanasyev told the
crowd.
   In Moscow, a city with scores of monuments to wars, poets and
politicians, the new monument is the only one to victims of
repression.
   It is a simple but eloquent marker: a rough piece of rock, 3
feet wide and 8 long, hewn from the harsh Solovetsky Islands in the
freezing White Sea.
   Those islands were the site of a notorious labor camp for
political prisoners, established in the early 1920s. More than 10
million people are believed to have been shot or died of hunger,
cold and hard labor in the desolate islands and dozens of other
camps across the country.
   The Soviet Union of Mikhail Gorbachev says it no longer holds
any political prisoners, but some human rights groups claim there
are still about 20, including pro-independence activists imprisoned
in the Ukraine and other republics.
   Memorial, a 3-year-old organization devoted to preserving the
memory of those who perished in the camps, erected the monument
with permission from Moscow's City Council.
   Vyacheslav Igrunov, a founder of the group, said it initially
had trouble persuading authorities that the monument should be
outside the KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square. Feliks
Dzerzhinsky founded the Cheka, the forerunner of the KGB.
   But Memorial insisted on the location because ``so many
political prisoners began their trip to the camps here,'' under
interrogation in the basement cells of the yellow, stone building,
said Igrunov, a former dissident who was imprisoned in the
mid-1970s.
   Among the marchers were several Russian Orthodox priests
carrying icons, or holy paintings. In addition to political
prisoners, many priests and religious activists were sent to camps.
   Other marchers carried banners condemning the Communist Party
and calling for public access to secret police archives. ``The KGB
cannot wash off the blood,'' said one banner.
   ``This was my father,'' said Alla Krichevskaya, crying softly as
she held up a faded photograph of a young man in an old-fashioned
high collar.
   ``I never knew him. He was sent to Solovetsky after his arrest
in 1932, a few months before I was born, and they shot him in
1937.''
   The unveiling of the monument was scheduled to coincide with
Political Prisoners Day, which marks two anniversaries: a 1974
hunger strike by political prisoners, and the death in a labor camp
of Yuri Galanskov, a poet and pacifist. He was sentenced in 1968 to
seven years in a camp and died in 1972.

   Two sailors died of their injuries hours
after being burned by bursts of steam aboard the USS Iwo Jima,
boosting the number of men killed in the accident aboard the ship
to 10.
   Chief Petty Officer Robert Haagenson of U.S. Naval Forces
Central Command said today the two men died ``very late last night
(Tuesday) as a result of their injuries.''
   Six sailors died immediately when the pipe ruptured Tuesday
morning. Four with severe burns were flown by helicopter to the
hospital ships USS Comfort, one of two such vessels in the Persian
Gulf. All four died.
   Also Tuesday, a Marine was killed in Saudi Arabia when the jeep
he was riding in went down an 20-foot embankment. He was identified
as 1st Lt. Michael N. Monroe, 27, of Auburn, Wash.
   Tuesday's fatalities brought to 43 the number of American
servicemen killed during Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. military
effort launched after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Haagenson said a memorial service will be held Thursday aboard
the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima for the 10 dead crew members.
   Killed in the Iwo Jima accident were David A. Gilliland, 21,
Warrensburg, Mo.; Mark E. Hutchison, 27, Elkins, W. Va.; Daniel
Lupatsky, 22, Centralia, Pa.; Daniel C. McKinsey, 21, Hanover, Pa.;
Fred R. Parker Jr., 24, Reidsville, N.C.; James A. Smith Jr., 22,
Somerville, Tenn.; John M. Snyder, 25, Milltown, N.J.; Robert L.
Volden, 28, New York City; Tyrone M. Brooks, 19, Detroit; and
Michael N. Manns Jr., 22, Fredericksburg, Va.
   An investigating team, headed by Rear Adm. J. B. Laplante, was
looking into the boiler room accident, a Navy statement said. It
said Laplante was ``appointed to conduct a preliminary inquiry
regarding the circumstances surrounding the accident.''
   Laplante and his aides were flown to Bahrain on Tuesday from his
ship, the USS Nassau, in the north Arabian Sea.
   The accident was the worst for the Navy in the U.S.-led air,
land and sea mobilization that followed the Iraqi invasion. The
only previous fatality on a Navy ship was an electrician's mate who
was accidentally electrocuted aboard the USS Antietam.
   The Iwo Jima is based in Norfolk, Va. Its crew comprised 685
members and some 1,100 Marines.
   The ship arrived in the Persian Gulf on Sept. 16 as part of the
U.S. naval armada in support of Operation Desert Shield.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Urges Limiting Arab Labor in Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GWEN ACKERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens is proposing a
program to limit Palestinians working in Israel while creating jobs
for them in the occupied territories, his spokesman said today.
   Spokesman Dan Naveh said Arens' proposal would reverse the
policy allowing Palestinians to work in Israel - a policy followed
since Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967.
   ``It is now time to start changing this so Israelis will get the
opportunities in Israel and Arabs will find jobs in the
territories,'' said Naveh.
   Arens' proposal, made Tuesday before Parliament's foreign
affairs and defense committee, would have to be adopted by the
government. The defense minister believes the proposal would
increase the Palestinians' autonomy by making them more self
sufficient, said Naveh.
   The change would be in line with the policy of Arens' Likud
bloc. It calls for giving the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands limited autonomy while maintaining Israel's control
over land seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Arens' plan would require a change in policy denying
Palestinians permits to build factories that could compete with
Israeli manufacturers. This has left the occupied lands as a
captive market for Israeli goods.
   The proposal comes at a time when Israel is facing increasing
anger from Palestinians and must find jobs for tens of thousands of
Soviet Jews who are immigrating to the Jewish state.
   Arab labor in Israel became an issue last week after Arens
ordered a four-day sealing of the Green Line, the border between
pre-1967 Israel and the occupied lands.
   The measure, taken after street violence left five dead
following the Temple Mount killings of 20 Palestinians, cut more
than 110,000 Arabs off from their jobs in Israel.
   It gave rise to calls from both left- and right-wing parties to
make the measure permanent. Israel has an unemployment rate of more
than 10 percent, a figure expected to grow as Soviet immigrants
pour in.
   ``The employment of more than 100,000 people, that come daily to
work here and do the work Jews want to do, is not positive. It
doesn't fit the Zionist ethic and it damages Israeli society,''
Arens told the parliamentary committee.
   ``We cannot put Arabs in a situation of being the wood cutters
and water carriers,'' Arens added.
   Assad Saftawi, a Palestinian leader in the Gaza Strip, said
Arens' proposal would only make things worse in the territories,
where unemployment is as high as 25 percent.
   ``I do not think Arens is serious, what I think the main aim of
the latest Israeli measures is a collective punishment,'' he said.
   Also today, Arab reports said Muti Al Haj, 19, of the West bank
village of Jalkamous died of injuries suffered in a clash with
Israeli soldiers Sept. 10.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, the army sealed the home of
Haitham Jamla, who was shot to death Tuesday after stabbing an
armed Israeli guard.
   In the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired an automatic weapon at an
Israeli army patrol, injuring one soldier in the leg, the army
said. Gunfire attacks have been rare during the 34-month
Palestinian uprising.
   Al Haj's death raised to 769 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis during the uprising. An additional 292 Palestinian have
been killed by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators.
Fifty-one Israelis also have died.

<HEAD>Survey: Japanese Remain Far Ahead of Americans in Savings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third year in a row, the Japanese were the
world's top savers last year, salting away nearly four times as
much money as Americans, according to a survey released today.
   Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands were next on
the annual, dollar-denominated list published by the International
Savings Banks Institute.
   At the end of 1989, the average Japanese had placed the
equivalent of $40,119 in savings and term deposits, the survey
said.
   In Japanese money, the figure was up 11 percent from 1988 to
about 5.7 million yen. The dollar total dropped about 2 percent,
mostly because the yen weakened against the U.S. currency.
   Switzerland, which Japan replaced at the top of the table in
1987, saw per capita savings fall 19 percent, the survey said. An
average Swiss had the equivalent of $23,418 in savings last year.
   Many other people living in western Europe saved slightly more
at the end of last year than in 1988, the institute said.
   Austria this year edged ahead of what was West Germany. The
Netherlands also pulled ahead of Germany, but the survey said the
increase followed a change in Dutch statistics.
   Following Germany were Norway, Singapore, France, Canada and
Finland.
   The United States ranked 14th, with per capita savings of
$10,822, up 4 percent from 1988. The United States ranked 8th in
last year's survey and 7th in 1987. Many countries' figures,
however, were boosted by the weakened dollar.
   The private, Geneva-based savings group compiled statistics from
82 countries.

<NOTE>EDS: INSERTS 3 grafs after 9th graf, Williams says, to include

amendment.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest issues in the Texas
gubernatorial race during the campaign's final week are money and
just who's ahead in the polls.
   Democrat Ann Richards contends the race is a dead heat;
Republican Clayton Williams disagrees.
   ``She's never broken 40 percent in any poll,'' insists Williams'
press secretary, Gordon Hensley. ``She's the `Typhoid Mary' of
Texas politics - nobody seems to want to vote for her.''
   But Ms. Richards, outspent by a margin of nearly 2-1 in the
state's most expensive governor's race, notes that the most recent
independent poll shows the candidates tied, each favored by 38
percent of those questioned.
   In August, the same poll had shown Williams with a 13-point
advantage.
   ``This race is even. There's no gap at all,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Jerry Polinard, a political scientist at the University of
Texas-Pan American, said the major shift has come from supporters
who are bolting from Williams, especially after he refused to shake
hands with Ms. Richards at a joint appearance in Dallas.
   ``He put his boot in his mouth again and he closed the gap,''
Polinard said.
   Williams says he isn't worried about polls that ``are bouncing
back and forth every day,'' adding that his own surveys show him
with a substantial lead.
   On Tuesday, Williams stumbled when asked his position on a
proposed constitutional amendment dealing with appointments by the
state's chief executive.
   Williams told reporters he was unfamiliar with the amendment,
the only one Tuesday's ballot, and was unclear how he had voted on
it when he cast his absentee ballot.
   He said he could give an opinion on the measure if he had a
half-minute to study it. ``I had the highest grade point in the
school of agriculture at (Texas) A&amp;M my last semester,'' he said.
   All of the comments came in advance of a Fort Worth
Star-Telegram poll, released late Tuesday night, that showed
Williams with a 45-41 percent lead in a survey that has a 3 percent
margin of error.
   However, Williams once again dipped into his personal bank
account to give his campaign a $1.4 million boost during the final
weeks.
   Campaign finance reports filed Monday showed that Williams had
spent $20.4 million, including about $8 million in personal funds,
since June 1989.
   ``That has to be some kind of world record for trying to buy a
governor's race,'' said Ms. Richards' spokesman, Bill Cryer. ``I
would be ashamed if I were his campaign. It shows he doesn't have
any support.''
   Ms. Richards has spent about $11.7 million.
   Hensley, Williams' spokesman, said Ms. Richards ``has an
unprecedented landslide of liberal, special-interest cash dumped in
from greedy trial lawyers, Hollywood liberals and others whose
agendas are contrary to the interests of the working people of
Texas.''
   ``We're not going to let Richards have special-interest groups
buy the election for her,'' he said.
   Ms. Richards' campaign manager, Mary Beth Rogers, said most
contributors have given $50 or less.
   Including money spent by other candidates in the March primary,
the $38 million or more spent on the 1990 governor's race easily
outpaces the $33 million record set in 1986, when Democratic Gov.
Mark White was ousted by Republican Bill Clements.
   Williams has spent the final weeks concentrating on several key
themes: a war on drugs, more prisons and no new taxes.
   In television commercials and on the stump, he's painted Ms.
Richards as ``the liberal'' and himself as ``the conservative.'' He
also sought to capitalize on anti-incumbent feelings by dubbing her
a career politician after two terms as state treasurer and service
as a county commissioner.
   Ms. Richards, who rose to national prominence as the keynote
speaker at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, has criticized
soaring health insurance costs and pledged consumer-oriented
reforms.
   One of her strongest weapons has been a 30-second television
commercial describing Williams ``in his own words.''
   The ad repeated some of Williams' verbal gaffes, including the
joke in which he likened bad weather to rape and said if it were
inevitable, ``just relax and enjoy it.'' He later apologized for
the comment.

   Two Boy Scouts whose hiking team was
surprised by a severe Alpine storm died in a hospital today from
the effects of exposure.
   The youths were airlifted to a Grenoble hospital Tuesday after
their leader, a 22-year-old former scout, managed to climb down the
mountain in bare feet to summon help, police said.
   Doctors said the two youths were barely alive when they arrived
at Grenoble's Sablons hospital, with body temperatures below 68
degrees. Doctors tried unsuccessfully to restore their heart beats.
   The victims were identified as Olivier Schmit, 20, and Sebastien
Baron, 16.
   A third scout, Michael Poursin, also was hospitalized, but his
condition was not critical, officials said.
   Prosecutors opened a homicide investigation Wednesday into the
actions of the Scout leader, Emmanuel Beninia, who was treated for
frostbite at the hospital and then briefly taken into police
custody.
   The group of seven scouts, all aged 16 to 20, and their leader
had come from a Paris suburb to spend the All Saints Day vacation
week hiking in the Alps.
   On Monday evening, the group camped on a mountainside above the
town of Parlognan-la-Vanoise, at an altitude of 8,200 feet. They
had hoped to reach a shelter, but were forced to stop several
hundred yards short of the refuge because of poor visibility.
   A storm moved in during the night, ripping their tents and
scattering their equipment, officials said.
   On Tuesday morning, the storm lifted and the leader of the group
descended to get help. Police said he made the descent in bare feet
because his boots had been lost in the storm.
   A helicopter reached the campsite at midday to evacuate the
hikers.
   Members of the regional mountain police unit said the scout team
was well-equipped, but apparently made the mistake of not obtaining
current weather reports. One officer said the hikers might have
changed plans if they had heard the radio forecast of the storm.

   President Roh Tae-woo's governing
party could face defections of lawmakers and chaos among its
leadership unless a feud over proposed government changes is
settled, party officials said today.
   Party leader Kim Young-sam made the prediction shortly after 22
lawmakers threatened to withdraw from the government.
   The tension in the 9-month-old coalition government intensified
last week when a Seoul newspaper published a secret memorandum
detailing plans to change from a presidential to a parliamentary
form of government, a move criticized by some as a ploy to keep
Roh's party in power.
   ``A forceful constitutional revision would face enormous public
resistance and bring a national chaos,'' Kim said.
   Under the parliamentary system, Roh's party would have an edge
in seats over the presently divided opposition. Some opposition
leaders say the party is pushing the reforms because it does not
have a strong candidate to run for president when Roh's five-year
term expires in early 1993.
   In a news conference at his home today, Kim apologized to the
nation and said the latest political crisis has given him
``distress and humiliation I cannot tolerate any longer.''
   Disclosure of the secret memo was especially a problem for Kim,
who had repeatedly denied he had made an agreement with Roh for a
new form of government. Kim hopes to succeed Roh as president.
   The memo was signed by Roh, Kim and party leader Kim Jong-pil in
May. The three men merged their parties in January to form the
governing coalition.
   The controversy comes in the third month of a boycott of the
299-seat National Assembly by 78 opposition members who charge the
governing party with railroading bills and reneging on democratic
reforms.
   Roh's supporters said Kim Young-sam's warnings about party
disputes were part of a power play to place his followers in
control. Kim has boycotted party duties since last weekend and
ignored Roh's urging that he return to work.
   Kim said discussions about a new government were prompted by
social and political unrest.
   Meanwhile, more than 15,000 riot police were mobilized today to
break up radical students trying to watch banned North Korean
movies on at least 15 college campuses around South Korea.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
   It was the fourth time in less than two months that police have
stormed campuses to block the unauthorized showing of North Korean
movies.
   The films ``Salt'' and ``Escape'' were shown at at least four
schools. The films reportedly promote a revolutionary cause.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's escalation of threats against
Iraq may be aimed at Saddam Hussein, but the message also is bound
to play well to Republican audiences.
   With just a week to go to midterm elections, growing talk of war
in the Persian Gulf is providing a diversion for the White House
after weeks of pounding on taxes and the budget.
   ``I think Americans should be focused on what's going on in the
gulf and in many ways it's too bad we had that dip in attention
during those two or three weeks,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, only partly in jest.
   Bush asserted today that he was keeping his Persian Gulf policy
totally separate from the political process.
   ``I don't think even the most cynical would ever suggest that a
president would play politics with the lives of American kids
halfway around the world,'' Bush said.
   Fitzwater and other Bush aides deny any political motivation in
the new round of coordinated saber-rattling by Bush and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III.
   But there's no denying that emphasizing the gulf crisis in the
closing days of the campaign may help steer the electorate's
attention away from the budget fiasco and the president's reversal
of his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   On Monday, Bush said in San Francisco that he would not hesitate
to use force if provoked. And he discussed possible military action
against Iraq in a meeting with congressional leaders Tuesday on the
gulf crisis.
   Baker, who told a Los Angeles gathering ``we will not rule out a
possible use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait,'' embarks
Saturday on a week-long visit to Arab and European countries,
beginning with Saudi Arabia.
   There is considerable speculation that Baker will discuss
military options with Saudi leaders.
   And the United States was clearly savoring the United Nations
Security Council's vote Monday declaring Iraq responsible for all
damage and personal injuries resulting from its occupation of Iraq.
   The council said the UN would take ``further measures'' under
its charter, although the use of force was not explicitly
mentioned. It was the latest in a series of resolutions designed to
increase pressure on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   At the White House, Bush discussed military options with
congressional leaders - and was cautioned by some of them not to
give up too soon on the economic sanctions against Baghdad, or let
impatience draw him into war.
   ``There's concern on Capitol Hill ... that this is somehow a
prelude to immediate military action,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   After stepping up its threats against Iraq on Monday, the White
House was drying to dampen fears Tuesday that fighting was
imminent.
   ``I would say that it's pretty much steady as she goes,''
Fitzwater said, trying to downplay suggestions that Bush's
heightened talk about military options was new.
   ``If that's true, I'm a dismal failure, because I'm trying to
play it down, be calm,'' he said.
   Asked pointblank whether the get-tough rhetoric was designed to
help focus the final week of the election on the Persian Gulf
instead of new taxes, Fitzwater said:
   ``I don't think there has been a shift ... I think the big
factor is simply that the Congress is leaving and they finished up
all the legislation, and now this has become a major focus again,
which is probably good.''
   Ed Rogers, White House political director, said there has been
no effort to gin up Bush's speeches for the last few weeks to
stress his toughness on the Persian Gulf. ``That's pretty much a
constant,'' he said.
   At the same time, Rogers said that Bush has clearly stepped up
his partisan attacks on Democrats, reflecting GOP strategy for the
final week of the campaign.
   Bush leaves Thursday on a cross-country political barnstorming
tour for GOP candidates - many of whom have kept him at arm's
length on tax issues. The trip will last through Election Day.
   On Tuesday, addressing a group of about 500 party workers at a
hotel rally, Bush moved easily from denouncing the Democratic-led
Congress as a ``hot dog factory'' to seeking to put a GOP seal on
his Persian Gulf policy.
   ``In times of crisis and challenge, the American spirit has been
a constant source of strength. It's true now, obviously, in the
Persian Gulf, and it's just as true at home today ... the spirit to
which Republicans are responding.''

   Japan's largest Christian organization has gathered
nearly 80,000 signatures on a petition opposing state funding of a
religious enthronement rite for Emperor Akihito, officials said
today.
   The National Christian Council of Japan, which began gathering
the signatures in December 1989, is one of a growing number of
groups opposing the rite, called the Daijosai, or Great Food
Offering Ritual.
   The council, an umbrella group encompassing nearly all
mainstream Protestant denominations, also is planning a hunger
strike to protest the funding of the ceremony.
   In the Daijosai, to be held 10 days after Akihito is formally
crowned Nov. 12, the emperor is to have his first communion with
the gods of Shinto, which until 1945 was Japan's state religion.
   Although the rite has roots going back more than a millennium,
opponents say it conflicts with the postwar constitution's
guarantee of freedom of religion and its ban on government
involvement in church activities.
   ``Government involvement in a religious ceremony like this is a
violation of the separation of church and state,'' said the
petition. ``We oppose government involvement in the Daijosai, and
we oppose government funding.''
   Council official Natsuko Yoshida said the petition is to be
presented to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other government
officials in mid-November, after the final count has been made.
   She said officials had hoped to present the petition earlier,
but the prime minister's office will not set a firm date, saying
they are too busy at present because parliament is in session.
   ``We had originally only hoped to get about 50,000 signatures,''
Yoshida said. ``And though we were able to get more than that we
are not really satisfied with just the numbers.''
   She said, however, that the signature drive was
``revolutionary'' because it had the support of nearly all
Christian groups in the country.
   ``The Catholics and some other groups had been slow to protest
in the past,'' Yoshida said. ``But we all came together for this,
and I think it will create a foundation for conducting future
protests.''
   Council officials also said that unless the government reverses
its funding policy, they are planning to begin the hunger strike on
Nov. 19 and stop it after the Daijosai ends on Nov. 23. Roughly
1,000 people are expected to join in the strike, they said.
   Over the past month, many groups from a wide section of society
have voiced concern about the government's handling of the rite.
   More than 1,500 people have filed suit in a district court in
western Japan claiming the state funding is unconstitutional.
   That case opened Tuesday in Osaka, Japan's second-largest city,
with each plaintiff demanding a token amount of money in damages
and a withdrawal of government funding if providing such is found
in violation of the constitution.
   Many of the people who brought the suit to court are Christians,
but the group also includes Buddhists, historians and teachers.
   Last week, the head of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations
said government funding could ``only be seen as a violation of the
principle of church-state separation.''
   Government officials say the funding is justified because it is
intended only to preserve an ancient imperial tradition, not to
promote religion.

   Fire broke out in an unoccupied hotel
room this morning, forcing the evacuation of about 300 guests for
about an hour.
   No one was injured, but the Radisson Hotel's sprinkler system
caused water damage to the lobby of the 11-story hotel.
   Fire Chief C. Rickman said sprinkers contained the fire to one
room.
   Hotel employees telephoned rooms and knocked on doors asking
guests to evacuate. Among the guests was actor Peter Marshall,
former host of the television game show ``The Hollywood Squares,''
who returned to the hotel from a radio interview after the fire

   A Huntington native, Marshall was in town for a performance of

   Moslem fundamentalists in Iran and
moderates led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani agreed to halt a
propoganda war waged since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death last
year, an Iranian newspaper said today.
   The English-language Tehran Times said officials from both camps
in the Parliament met Monday and ``decided to stop their war of
words.''
   The meeting grouped Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, who leads
the hard-liners in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, and Nateq
Noori, leader of the so-called pragmatic faction that backs
Rafsanjani.
   Karrubi's brother was arrested last month on charges of
corruption, and Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
ordered an audit of the multimillion dollar Martyr's Foundation,
which Karrubi heads.
   But Karrubi declared his allegiance to Khamenei earlier this
week, and warned other radicals in parliament to watch what they
say.
   Arguments and fist-fights broke out in the Majlis earlier this
month after Khamenei excluded most radical candidates from
elections for a key constitutional body. Khamenei is a political
ally of Rafsanjani, who has been trying to purge the government of
fundamentalists since Khomeini's death.
   The hard-liners accuse Rafsanjani of violating Khomeini's
teachings by seeking to improve relations with the West and Iran's
Arab neighbors. They have also declared Khamenei unfit to be
Khomeini's successor.

<HEAD>Former Communist Official in Vietnam Sentenced for Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Vietnamese Communist Party
official linked to an $8 million bank fraud has been sentenced to
life in prison as part of a government crackdown on corruption,
state radio reported.
   The Voice of Vietnam also reported a government forestry
ministry was dismissed for allowing illegal timber exports.
   Former Communist Party official Hoang Thi Xuan was sentenced by
the Supreme Court in Vinh Phu province near Hanoi for the 1988 bank
fraud scam, the Monday radio broadcast said. A transcript of the
broadcast was seen today in Bangkok.
   Twenty-three other defendants, including bank officers and local
government officials, received punishments ranging from 15 years in
jail to suspended sentences, it said.
   The court ruled the defendents plotted with bank officials to
alter the amounts of 22 checks and loaned the extra $425,000 to
earn interest.
   The Voice of Vietnam said Premier Do Muoi fired Vice Minister
Than Trung Hieu on Monday for causing ``great losses'' to the
forestry industry in Vietnam.
   An earlier state radio report said Hieu improperly allowed the
export of timber worth $9.6 million. Hieu diverted other logs,
claiming they were destroyed by fire, and committed other
irregularities.
   The radio report did not give further details on the timber
exports.
   On Saturday, the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court sentenced
Nguyen Van Moi Hai to life in prison for defrauding hundreds of
thousands of people of $30 million in a so-called pyramid scheme.
   The official Vietnam News Agency report of the trial said Hai
had used his perfume company as a front for a high-interest
investment scheme in which he paid back investors with money
deposited later by other people.
   It said Hai also bribed government officials with gold and
money.
   The agency on Monday said the court also sentenced Hai's wife,
Nguyen Thi Nhu, to 12 years in jail.
   The tribunal issued punishments ranging from 14 years in jail to
suspended sentences to the trial's 20 other defendant, including
eight government members.
   The official media called it Vietnam's ``biggest case of fraud
known to date.''
   Vietnam's reform-minded government has been working in recent
months to root out corruption and mismanagement.
   Radio Hanoi noted in an Oct. 23 editorial that corruption was
particularly severe in the banking industry and among those
managing the nation's meager natural reserves.
   The report, seen today in Bangkok, also said the problem was
getting worse.
   ``We can say that corruption is no longer regarded as a practice
that involves only those degenerate or deviant people with
positions and power,'' the radio said. ``It has become a social
vice.''

<TEXT>
   Reuters, the international news and financial
services agency, said today it will cut 300 jobs, 200 of them in
Britain, because of ``difficult and unsettled'' market conditions.
   The company said it also will delay the launch of Dealing 2000,
an improved system for electronically providing foreign exchange
information to traders.
   ``Conditions in most financial markets remain difficult and
unsettled, making forecasting beyond the current year more than
usually hazardous,'' said managing director Glen Renfrew.
   ``We cannot rule out further setbacks, but the recent new order
rate has been large enough, in combination with cost cutting, to
support steady growth.''
   Reuters said the jobs to be cut will be in the central corporate
departments covering finance, marketing and administration. A small
number of editorial jobs also could be affected.
   The layoffs represent 6 percent of the British payroll and 3
percent of the worldwide work force.
   Reuters shares dropped 42 pence (81 cents) to 566 pence ($10.98)
by mid-afternoon on the London Stock Exchange, a new 1990 low. A
total of 2 million shares changed hands.
   Renfrew said severence pay for those let go will cost the
company around 10 million pounds ($19.4 million) in 1990.
   After absorbing this, the company expects pre-tax profits for
1990 to be around 320 million pounds ($620 million), he said.
   Reuters said it will make a statement on business conditions in
early December, when analysts meet in New York.

   The Meridian (Miss.) Star on Bush and taxes:
   ``The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and
they'll push, and I'll say no. And they'll push again. And I'll say
to them: Read my lips. No new taxes.''
   - George Bush, August 1988
   Apparently, Congress pushed harder than then-presidential
candidate Bush anticipated.
   Times and circumstances do change. The federal deficit is
considerably higher than it was when Bush made that emphatic
promise in his acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans. The president made the decision to
compromise in the national interest.
   But now he has taken to the campaign trail in an attempt to wash
his hands of responsibility for the biggest tax increase in
history. The Democrats in Congress made him do it, he told
auidences over the weekend.
   Well, the president obviously knew two years ago that he would
be pressured to go along with a tax increase. He didn't just say,
I'm against new taxes, he went further in declaring his intent to
resist the inevitable push to raise them. It is understandable that
the president's public standing and credibility have eroded
somewhat as a result of his reversal.
   The president would be better served politically if he would
simply admit that his hard line was unrealistic rather than blaming
the opposition for a tax package that he, his staff and Republican
congressional leaders helped craft and approved.

   The Evening Telegram, Superior, Wis., on the budget:
   C.B. Scott Jones, an aide to Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode
Island, recently wrote Defense Secretary Richard Cheney with a
startling revelation: When tapes of speeches by Cheney, Secretary
of State James Baker and President Bush are played backwards, the
word ``simone'' can be heard. ...
   Jones alerted Secretary Cheney to his discovery because he
feared ``simone'' might be a ``code word that would not be in the
national interest to be known.'' ...
   Pell himself says, ``There may be some merit to it.'' ...
   Jones modestly admits that the whole thing may be a ``non-event,
just another mystery in a new technology we are developing.''
   Let's hear more about this new technology.
   If, for example, we played Bush's famous ``No new taxes''
campaign speech backwards, might we not hear the spectral words,
``I'm lying, I'm lying''? And those pious speeches by congressmen
calling for fiscal restraint - wouldn't the reverse speech
technique reveal a voice whimpering, ``Let me keep my pay raise''?
   No wonder we've had such trouble reading their lips!
   ---
   Oct. 24
   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on the budget:
   There may be some comfort in all this budget mess. We are
learning that the definition of ``rich'' is not an exact one.
   Both Republicans and Democrats want to use new taxes on the
``rich'' to help balance the budget. That's an easy target. Since
few of us consider ourselves ``rich'' the proposed taxes meet the
first obligation of a tax proposal; they tax someone else.
   House Speaker Tom Foley thinks ``rich'' starts with an income of
$100,000 per year. George Bush holds to the same figure in part: He
would raise taxes on those with incomes that high by limiting their
deductions. Dan Rostenkowski, the chief House tax writer, thinks it
takes $200,000 a year in income to make one rich. Some other
members of the conference committee think the floor of wealth is at
$300,000.
   But everyone is in agreement on one thing. An income of $1
million makes one truly rich. All are agreed on a new, higher tax
for entertainers, for professional athletes and for those few
leaders of big business who make that kind of money. That seems
reasonable; few could argue that earnings of $1 million leave
anyone disadvantaged.

   Oct. 30
   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Congress' record:
   The 101st Congress has adjourned to the boos and catcalls of a
disgusted public. Yet on balance it had a productive session, a
fact of which today's anti-incumbent voters should take note.
   Despite the shortcomings of the process, Congress did finally
approve a major deficit-cutting measure, which for the first time
in nearly a decade faces the need for new revenue to restore fiscal
sanity.
   It also endorsed the first major revision of the Clean Air Act
in 13 years, promising major improvements in the nation's air and
water. Both the budget and clean air measures represent the
resolution of tough political conflicts that completely stymied
several earlier Congresses.
   The legislative session was a messy one; divisions between a
Democratic Congress and a Republican president didn't help.
Nevertheless, the results were impressive. Democracy still works.

   The Phoenix Gazette on obscenity:
   Despite all the rhetoric and posing of law enforcement officials
who just happened to be up for re-election, juries in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and Cincinnati, Ohio, came to the appropriate
conclusion ...: Law enforcement officers and district attorneys
should stick to enforcing laws in the streets and stay out of art
galleries and nightclubs.
   The Fort Lauderdale jury that acquitted members of 2 Live Crew
on obscenity charges and the Cincinnati jury that acquitted art
gallery officials for exhibiting photos by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe offered a working example of how freedom of speech
works. Even unpopular things can be said; even some mighty rough
words can be uttered in the course of an artistic performance.
   So once again the juries show themselves as more sophisticated
in the meaning of America's freedoms than the politicians and
county attorneys who have attempted to gain politically by
attacking as pornographic that which is unpopular.
   One juror was so unimpressed with the prosecution's effort
against 2 Live Crew that she toyed with the idea of writing the
jury's verdict as a rap number. It's probably a good thing she
dispensed with the notion. Rap isn't all that safe in Broward
County, Fla., these days.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Israel:
   Once again, the United Nations Security Council has voted to
condemn Israel for its refusal to cooperate with an investigation
into the killing of Palestinians ... at the Temple Mount.
   The Security Council is right. Israel's stonewalling of the
investigation must stop. Otherwise, it looks as though the Israeli
government has something to hide.
   Many questions remain regarding the Temple Mount incident. In an
unprovoked attack, several thousand Palestinians at the Al Aksa
Mosque threw rocks at Israeli worshipers at the Western Wall below,
and Israeli soldiers opened fire on the Palestinians.
   In the days since the incident, tension and hatred between Arabs
and Jews have soared, with calls for revenge from both sides.
   Some Israeli officials have exacerbated the tension by making
inflammatory and irresponsible statements. The minister of
agriculture, for example, said on Israeli radio that one possible
solution to finding an armed Arab would be ``to shoot him in the
head.''
   For its own good - and for the good of the world - Israel must
work to end tensions and restore calm.

   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on Israel:
   Israeli bravery is becoming Israeli defiance, and it harms no
one more than Israel itself.
   President Yitzhak Shamir, by refusing to receive a United
Nations team seeking to investigate the killing of 21 Arabs by
Israeli troops, is showing contempt for the very international law
that can guarantee Israel's survival. ...
   The United States may be Israel's best friend, but ... American
patience is not infinitely elastic. ... An Arab death and an
Israeli death are equally lamentable. ...
   The Bush administration was right to register its displeasure.

   Philadelphia Daily News on Lois Lane:
   Lois Lane and Clark Kent are getting married - each looking not
one day older than they did when they first met in the comic strips
a half-century ago.
   They'll make a lovely couple, we're sure - but frankly, we've
always had some doubts about Lois.
   For 50 years, she's been working alongside Clark and being
frequently rescued from death (or worse) by Superman. In all that
time, she's never guessed that the Man of Steel and her
mild-mannered fellow reporter are the same guy.
   Doesn't sound like the kind of reporter we'd like to send out on
important assignments. Maybe the Daily Planet should reassign her
to something a little less demanding.
   Like writing editorials, for example.

   Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal on a new hope in Lebanon:
   As an indirect result of the Persian Gulf crisis, a new light is
showing at the end of a long tunnel of tragedy and misery in
Lebanon.
   Fifteen years of insanity have almost destroyed what once was a
Mediterranean coast of exquisite beauty. Ruins replaced what then
was Riviera-lie resorts and casinos, high-fashion shops and
bustling business centers.
   Gen. Michael Aoun, leader of a lonely fragment of Christian
opposition, has been defeated. The reason: Iraq can no longer ship
weapons to him or support him in his bloody struggle. Actually,
Aoun chose to surrender rather than fight to the death, as he had
promised to do.
   Now, the general has been given asylum in the French embassy in
Beirut. The collapse of his forces means that an agreement reached
last year will go into effect, ending domination of Lebanese
politics by the Christian minority. A stronger central government
may arise from the ashes.
   France's protection of Gen. Aoun is symbolic, for that country
was there in the beginning and is there at the end.
   Lebanon was formed in 1920 from five districts of the
dismembered Turkish empire. France took over its political affairs
in 1922 with a mandate to prepare the new country for independence.
The French united the Christians in Mount Lebanon and the Muslims
along the coast under one government and helped to write its
constitution.
   Lebanon became completely independent in 1943, with Christians
and Muslims sharing power, but French troops remained until 1946.
The national Covenant, establishing Christian power, was adopted
before they left.
   About 90 percent of Lebanon's people are Arabs and they have
become increasingly intolerant toward a system of government in
which particular offices were reserved for certain religious
groups.
   Syria, which has historical claims to the rule of Lebanon, was
invited by the Arab League to send in troops as peacemakers during
a civil war in 1976. They have been there ever since, controlling a
large portion of the country.
   Factional militias and Palestinian guerilla groups continued to
hold territory, fighting for advantage. Israel aided the Christian
faction and periodically sent retaliatory forces into South
Lebanon.
   The result of all these bitter contentions was anarchy and
bloodletting. The American embassy in Beirut was dynamited, and
more than 200 U.S. Marines were killed in a suicide bombing of
their barracks.
   Americans and other hostages are still held in the satanic
tenements of the Moslem section of West Beirut. Palestinians and
other militias are still armed and dangerous. Israeli forces still
occupy a zone of South Lebanon.
   Perhaps peace is now in sight for this beleaguered territory. It
would be to the benefit of all the contending factions to end the
slaughter and establish a new government chosen by free elections.

   NRC Handelsblad, Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the U.S. budget
agreement:
   After the lingering negotiations between Republicans and
Democrats, between the House of Representatives, the Senate and the
White House, at which budget proposals were tumbling all over one
another, the (U.S.) federal government was briefly closed down and
President George Bush incurred political damage. ...
   It is a start of the purge of the American federal overspending.
   From a political point of view the new budget means a change.
Congress' rebellion against an earlier budget compromise has in the
end created a result at which more taxes are being raised and less
is being cut down.
   Especially wealthy Americans are left holding the baby. The
favoritism of the rich elite, which profited from the anti-tax
sentiment in the United States in the '80s, has met with more and
more powerful resistance from the American middle class. The
Democrats in Congress have broken through the budget limbo in the
end and shoved a larger part of the burden through to the Americans
with the highest incomes.
   This new tax populism could very well set a trend.
Internationally the United States often sets the political tone for
economic policy. In the '80s this was the case with lowering taxes
and a supply-economy. The '90s can become the era of rebellion of
the middle class. In Europe this will then go at the cost of the
``solidarity.''

   The Times of India, New Delhi, on the Soviet Union:
   It might be a blessing in disguise that more people can place
Chernobyl than Chernenko. The Soviet Communist Party's entirely
forgettable general secretary, who preceded its most memorable one,
has been gravely dishonored even by Russian standards.
   The passion associated with de-Stalinization is lacking,
replaced by a crueler indifference.
   Konstantin Chernenko's bronze bust has reportedly proved most
awkward since no one knows what to do with it.
   It can't even be exiled to Siberia because that's where it
already is, and the citizens of Krasnoyarsk are being rather crass
about playing host to it, having already knocked it off its
pedestal.

   The Times, London, on the European Community summit in Rome:
   This summit was a disgrace. Challenged to resolve the chaos of
farm prices in advance of the GATT round, members decided instead
to bring forward a debate on economic union scheduled for December.
   In doing so, they almost casually accepted a 1994 date for a new
central bank, to be followed by a single currency and the surrender
of national control of economic policy.
   While few members expect actually to go along with such a union
come the day, anything was clearly better than talking about farm
prices.
   Such procedural anarchy is a measure of the shambles of the
current Italian presidency of the EC - and of the EC's way of
doing, or not doing, urgent business.
   This is not the executive decisiveness of Europe PLC, more the
last days of the Austro-Hungarian empire, seizing ever more power
to the center but careless of what to do with it.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today defended its recent
detonation of a nuclear device and said it would have been
dangerous to dalay the underground test until winter.
   The Soviets exploded the device Oct. 24 on the arctic island of
Novaya Zemlya, less than 500 miles from Finland and Norway.
   Following complaints from the Nordic nations, the Soviet
Parliament adopted a resolution today ordering the government to
notify northern European countries in advance of any nuclear test.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly P. Karpov, a nuclear arms
specialist, told a news conference that the test had voluntarily
been put off for nearly a year, but that because of weather
conditions the test had to be carried out.
   ``The nuclear device was in there for nearly a year. Every
warranty for the time period was ending because winter was coming,
and in winter, it is impossible to test,'' Karpov said. ``If we
waited until April or May, many unexpected things could happen to
the nuclear charge, and we could face a much more dangerous
situation.''
   The yield of the device, set off 200 yards underground, was 15
to 20 kilotons. There were no adverse affects to the region's
ecology, he said.
   Karpov said he met with the ambassadors from Finland, Sweden,
Norway, Denmark and Iceland, who protested underground testing.
   ``They said testing could hinder cooperation between the Nordic
countries and the Soviet Union in the field of ecology,'' Karpov
said. ``I explained why we had to hold the explosion at this
moment.''
   He said the ambassadors were aware that only one Soviet device
was exploded this year and that ``it was a forced test and the
Soviet Union took all measures to avoid negative influence on the
environment.''
   Karpov, citing seven U.S. tests and two Chinese tests, said
although there would be no more tests this year, if it was
necessary for the defense and security of the Soviet Union, more
could be carried out in the future.
   The Parliament, ending three days of hearings on nuclear
underground testing, passed a resolution today ordering that
neighboring countries be notified of underground tests.
   The resolution also asked the Council of Ministers to speed up
work, on a report on the impact of the Novaya Zemlya test and its
impact on areas of the Far North.

   A city-run haunted house was exorcised
after a nun gave them the devil.
   The haunted house featured a room where the devil asked children
to sign over their souls while a lost soul implored them to resist.
   A Roman Catholic nun, Sister Jeanne McGue of the Gary Diocese,
was outraged when she heard about it. She mobilized some priests to
call officials of this Chicago suburb to protest.
   ``I read about this in the newspaper and I couldn't believe my
eyes that they were trying to get children to sign their souls over
to the devil,'' McGue said. ``Granted, Halloween is supposed to be
fun, but we have to draw the line. This is not child's play.''
   Parks Superintendent Richard Gomez said he closed the devil's
room to avoid controversy.
   ``They felt that kids at this young age are impressionable and
they didn't need to be exposed to this activity, and I agreed with
them,'' Gomez said. ``The main purpose is to provide recreation for
the kids ... We will still continue to have the scariest haunted
house in the region.''

   Authorities imposed a curfew in parts
of the capital Wednesday after Moslem mobs attacked Hindu temples
and set fire to homes and shops in response to a Hindu-Moslem
dispute in neighboring India.
   Curfew orders restricting people to their homes were also
imposed in Chittagong, the country's second-largest city, after
similar attacks began there on Tuesday night.
   The mobs took to the streets after hearing news of an attempt in
India by fundamentalist Hindus to take over a mosque in the town of
Ayodhya and replace it with a Hindu temple.
   Witnesses said about 2,000 people rampaged through a residential
district where Chittagong's largest temple is located and torched
at least 300 Hindu homes.
   Police fired in the air and said they arrested 10 people.
Witnesses said they saw at least 35 other people being taken away
by police.
   At least 11 temples in the port city were broken into and
vandalized, officials and witnesses said. One group destroyed about
50 mud-and-straw huts owned by Hindus. Another mob attacked a
garage owned by a Hindu and damaged five vehicles.
   In Dhaka, about 1,000 Moslems staged a protest march toward the
Indian High Commission or embassy. The crowd was stopped by riot
police but then attacked a temple and Hindu homes in nearby areas,
reporters at the scene said.
   State-run television announced an indefinite curfew in three
districts of the city beginning at 6 p.m. Police said they fired
tear gas to disperse the crowd.
   Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, is an Islamic state whose
110 million people are 88 percent Moslem. About 10 percent are
Hindus.
   India, which borders Bangladesh on three sides, is a
predominantly Hindu but officially secular nation. Hindus comprise
82 percent of the country's 880 million people and Moslems make up
12 percent.

<TEXT>
   Incumbent Mayor Tom Fink held a lead of
more than 1,000 votes today, but the challenger said he wouldn't
concede defeat until 3,400 challenged ballots were tallied.
   ``We're gonna stick it out,'' said Rich Mystrom, who trailed
after all 91 precincts were counted in Tuesday's runoff election.
   The municipal clerk's office said the unofficial count,
including absentee votes, gave Fink the edge - 30,338 votes to
29,245.
   More than 48 percent of registered voters turned out Tuesday.
The election came down to a runoff after neither Fink nor Mystrom
gained 40 percent of the vote in a three-way race that included
former state legislator H.A. ``Red'' Boucher.
   Authorities said challenged ballots - those cast by voters at
polling places outside their own precincts - would be examined
today.
   Fink, who appeared headed for his second three-year term, told
supporters gathered at his headquarters he was pleased about
leading all night, and got a good-natured round of booing when he
said the runoff was still too close to call.
   It was a remarkable turnaround for a politician who, according
to polls six months ago, was rated negatively by 50 percent or more
of Anchorage residents.
   For Mystrom, that dissatisfaction translated into an early,
comfortable lead, but it steadily eroded over the last three
months.
   Mystrom, 46, is a former Anchorage assemblyman and former
advertising executive who led the city's unsuccessful winter
Olympics bid.
   Fink, 62, is an Anchorage insurance executive whose first
mayoral term found him variously at odds with the municipal
assembly, local reporters and unions representing city workers.

   A judge facing an election next week
shares his last name with an unpopular federal judge and has
launched a campaign to make sure voters don't ``vote against the
wrong guy.''
   Jackson County Circuit Judge Thomas C. Clark says he is often
confused with U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark, who angered
many residents by raising taxes to desegregate Kansas City's
schools.
   Thomas Clark's answering machine at home begins: ``This is not
the residence of Russell G. Clark.'' His 15-second radio campaign
spot tells voters, ``Don't vote against the wrong guy.''
   The name confusion was once merely annoying, but now Thomas
Clark worries voters kicking the wrong Clark could make him the
second judge ever to lose a retention election held under
Missouri's 50-year-old merit appointment system.
   To avoid that, Thomas Clark has broken with tradition and
launched a campaign to keep his bench. Missouri judges usually
avoid politics and run on their records.
   But the records of the two Judge Clarks are often confused.
   When Thomas Clark received a 50-signature petition this year
demanding he rehire a fired school principal, he sent it to Russell
Clark, who oversees school desegregation.
   Russell Clark replied with a letter advising him to change his
name to something like ``Zweerink or Zurweste.''

<TEXT>
   Voters don't seem to like either Kansas
gubernatorial candidate very much, and their respective stands on
abortion don't appear to be enticing constituents.
   Republican Gov. Mike Hayden and Democrat Joan Finney have
negative overall ratings so large that political consultants say
neither would stand a chance of election against an opponent that
voters felt good about.
   Hayden's unfavorable rating consistently has exceeded 40
percent; Mrs. Finney's has climbed past 30 percent during the
campaign.
   Mrs. Finney, the state treasurer, had an 18-point lead early in
the campaign, but political observers think the neck-and-neck
contest may be headed for the closest finish ever in a Kansas
governor's race.
   In a state that has one of the nation's most liberal abortion
laws, Hayden is the clear pick of pro-choice groups.
   In a political reversal, Hayden has declared himself pro-choice.
Mrs. Finney is staunchly anti-abortion.
   It is Hayden who has captured the endorsement of Molly Yard of
the National Organization for Women. That's a rarity for a
Republican, especially one who was endorsed by right to life groups
in 1986.
   Mrs. Finney, a Roman Catholic, wants the issue to go away. Women
Democratic legislators have said publicly they're having a hard
time supporting Mrs. Finney because of her anti-abortion stand.
   In cases of rape and incest, ``we have to look far deeper than a
reactionary act like abortion,'' she said in September, touching
off a furor.
   That widely publicized statement was offensive to large numbers
of women and turned a lot of voters to Hayden, says Frank Ybarra,
the governor's campaign press secretary.
   Mrs. Finney, meanwhile, is waging a damage control effort.
   She's said she won't propose legislation restricting abortions,
although she says she would sign restrictions into law if they came
to her as governor.
   And she's stopped talking about abortion as the campaign nears
its conclusion, while aides try to downplay her earlier comments.
   ``I don't know how significant an issue it will be,'' said
Finney spokesman Mark Schmeller. ``Polls show it's a major concern
for only 10 percent or so of the voters. I think it'll probably be
a wash.''
   There are other issues in the campaign. One is the state sales
tax.
   Hayden proposes raising that tax a penny, to 5.25 percent, and
using the estimated $215 million in new revenue to reduce school
property taxes.
   Mrs. Finney has proposed putting a 1 percent sales tax on goods
and services now exempt, raising $460 million to lower school and
local government property taxes.
   Mrs. Finney says Hayden's plan is inadequate; he says her plan
would devastate Kansas business and agriculture by adding to the
cost of state products sold elsewhere.
   It has been a negative campaign, by Kansas standards.
   Hayden has questioned Mrs. Finney's competence, saying she's
unable to manage the treasurer's office, much less the entire state
government.
   Mrs. Finney has accused Hayden of twisting her positions to make
her look bad, and of airing ``mudslinging'' advertising.
   The latest figures show Hayden outspending Mrs. Finney $1.3
million to $274,000 during the fall campaign. Much of his money has
gone for television commercials.
   In one, Kansas first lady Patti Hayden asks voters if they know
which candidate for governor opposes capital punishment, ``even for
people who murder children.''
   A Finney TV commercial shows blobs of mud being slapped on a
picture of Mrs. Finney's face, with the announcer explaining which
charge by Hayden each spat represents.
   At the conclusion, the announcer says: ``All of this makes Joan
Finney look pretty good. And the governor? Just another mudslinging
politician.''

the commission in a statement released Tuesday.
   The commission said the erasers do not meet the small parts

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-level representatives from more than 150
countries who converge on Tokyo in two weeks for the coronation of
Emperor Akihito likely will have another agenda: getting money.
   Japanese officials expect the Nov. 12 ceremony and parade to be
a replay of the February 1989 funeral of Emperor Hirohito, when
dozens of visiting foreign officials sought greater economic
assistance.
   Japan recently surpassed the United States as the largest donor
of government aid to the Third World.
   ``It wasn't because they all loved Hirohito,'' said Robert Orr,
director of the Stanford Japan Center and an expert on Japanese
foreign assistance.
   ``I expect the same thing (this time). They're coming because
they have other interests, they want some of that Japanese money.''
   During the funeral diplomacy, then Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita had talks with 40 foreign dignitaries, and then Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno met with 69, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Japan's foreign aid in 1989 was $9 billion, compared with $7.7
billion from the United States, the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development announced earlier this year.
   But Japan ranked 12th of 18 major donor countries in terms of
aid as a percentage of gross national product. It was 10th in aid
on a per capita basis.
   Japan is in the middle of a five-year plan which should
distribute about $50 billion, roughly twice the aid of the previous
five-year period.
   With the U.S. economy apparently tumbling into recession, the
importance of Tokyo to fund-seeking statesmen has become even
larger.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady stopped in Tokyo early
last month as part of a global fund-raising mission for the
multinational military buildup against Iraq.
   Days later, Japan pledged an additional $3 billion to the
effort, including $2 billion in aid to Middle Eastern nations
facing hardships because of the crisis.
   The past week has shown just how crowded the corridors of power
in Japan can become with aid seekers.
   Nguyen Co Thach made the first official visit to Japan in 12
years by a Vietnamese foreign minister and headed home with a
promise of a $180,000 grant for his country's national television
station. The Japanese Foreign Ministry described the grant as the
first major economic assistance to Hanoi since 1978, when Vietnam
invaded Cambodia.
   Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov also came to Tokyo seeking loans to
help convert state businesses into private enterprises, such as the

   Another visitor, South African black leader Nelson Mandela,
discovered the limits of Japanese largesse Monday when Tokyo
rejected his request for $25 million for the African National
Congress, which has been at the forefront of the fight against
apartheid.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu responded that Japan does not give
assistance to political parties, and instead offered funds to
grass-roots groups working to improve living and educational
conditions in South Africa.
   Mandela labeled Japan's contribution as ``absolutely
insignificant'' compared with packages from other, much poorer,
Asia nations.
   Generally, the political objectives of Japanese foreign aid have
not been clearly defined.
   As a sign of changing times, however, Japanese officials point
to their decision to temporarily freeze a $5.4 billion loan package
to China to protest the crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy movement
in Beijing.
   ``We'd like to support those countries working harder for the
democratic process,'' said Takanori Kitamura, director of the
ministry's research and programming division.
   Orr describes such statements as ``a major change in the
rhetoric. Whether it's a major change in policy remains to be
seen.''

<HEAD>Foundation Rewards Two Who Provide Clean Needles To Drug Addicts</HEAD>

   Two people who lead programs providing clean
hypodermic needles to drug addicts to prevent the spread of AIDS
received awards of $50,000 each on Wednesday from the Drug Policy
Foundation.
   The foundation, which advocates decriminalization of illegal
drugs and treating drug abuse as a health problem, not a law
enforcement problem, gave the awards to Jon C. Parker, founder of
the National AIDS Brigade, and David Purchase, founder of the
Tacoma (Wash.) Needle Exchange.
   National drug control policy director William J. Bennett has
criticized such needle exchange programs, saying they muddy the
anti-drug message by enabling people to continue using illegal
drugs.
   Parker was acquitted in a widely publicized trial in Boston for
providing free needles to addicts, and he sought arrest on similar
charges during a recent tour of numerous cities.
   ``We will try to do it openly in several states and try to push
the system,'' Parker said in an interview before the tour began.
``I don't think they should waste money arresting people trying to
save lives.''
   He faces charges in New York City; Jersey City, N.J.; Lowell,
Mass.; and Redwood City, Calif. However, police in Baltimore and
Washington, among other places, declined to arrest him.
   Parker, a former addict who is a Yale University graduate
student in public health, said 35 percent of addicts not in
needle-exchange programs in Boston and New Haven, Conn. tested
positive for the AIDS virus, compared to 13 percent in Boston and
28 percent in New Haven for those in such programs.
   Parker said there was more AIDS already in New Haven than in
Boston when his programs started five years ago.
   Purchase got approval from Tacoma's police chief before he
started offering a one-for-one exchange of used syringes for clean
ones at a table on a downtown sidewalk in August 1988. The program,
which serves up to 350 users each week, was ruled legal last
January.
   The Drug Policy Foundation also gave a $10,000 award to Arnold
and Mae Nutt of Beaverton, Mich. who became active in making it
easier to get marijuana for medical use after their son contracted
cancer. He was debilitated by chemotherapy until he got relief from
the drug, which his parents had to obtain illegally.
   Another $10,000 award was given to three people from Liverpool,
England - psychiatrist John Marks, Allan Parry, who runs a needle
exchange program, and Pat O'Hare, the executive editor of ``The
International Journal on Drug Policy.''
   The money for the foundation's awards came from Richard J.
Dennis, who earned millions when he was a Chicago Mercantile
Exchange broker and who now supports the foundation and other
groups that advocate some form of decriminalization of illegal
drugs.

   The Coast Guard today recovered the body
of a fourth worker killed when a southern Louisiana gas well
exploded in flames, and the search continued for a fifth man who is
presumed dead.
   A sixth man was seriously injured in the blast Tuesday evening,
which occurred as workers tried to cap the well and shut it down,
the Coast Guard said. The rig is in marshes surrounding Barataria
Bay south of New Orleans.
   The fire burned for about three hours, the Coast Guard said, but
there apparently was no blowout or pollution.
   The bodies of three workers were recovered within hours of the
accident.
   Coast Guard and civilian boats searched overnight for the two
missing workers, and Coast Guard helicopters rejoined the search
today.
   The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
   The dead and missing were employed by Pacer Atlas of Houston,
Maestas said. ODY Corp. of Lafayette owned the well.
   The rig is about 15 miles north of Grand Isle, a barrier island
between the bay and te Gulf of Mexico.

<HEAD>GOP Helping Push For More Black House Districts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With encouragement from Republicans and the
Supreme Court, blacks are pressing for the creation of new minority
congressional districts next year, a demand that threatens
once-secure Democrats.
   Creating a black congressional district in Virginia, for
example, could require stripping three Democratic congressmen of
their most reliable supporters.
   Comparable situations exist in Alabama, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas, according to an official of
the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
   The conflicting agendas of blacks and long-term white Democratic
incumbents present an unusual opportunity for Republican gains when
new legislative district lines are drawn next year to conform to
the 1990 Census.
   The final Census figures won't be available until next spring.
But preliminary data indicate that 19 House seats will shift, most
of them going from northern industrial states to the Sun Belt.
   Democrats are far stronger than Republicans in state
legislatures where the new lines will be drawn. Through alliances
with blacks as well as through court action, Republicans hope to
neutralize, at least partially, that Democratic advantage.
   The GOP tactic is driving a wedge between Democratic Party
leaders and their most reliable constituency.
   ``There's going to be a real serious problem between blacks and
the Democratic Party establishment,'' said Hank Sanders, a black
Alabama state senator.
   Even in Virginia, where Gov. L. Douglas Wilder is black,
tensions are high between civil rights organizations and party
officials.
   Paul Goldman, the white chairman of the Virginia Democratic
Party, complains that civil rights groups ``have threatened
Virginia. They say if you don't do this or you don't do that, we're
going to sue you.''
   ``We will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that
there is a black congressional district in Virginia in 1991,'' said
Jack Gravely, president of the state NAACP.
   Wilder has approached such proposals with extreme caution. The
closest the nation's first elected black governor came to endorsing
the concept was when he told the state NAACP that he saw no legal
prohibition to such a district.
   At the same time, Wilder warned blacks against redistricting
alliances with Republicans, saying it would be ``wrong to write off
one party and get in bed with the other, not knowing what's in that
bed. You might get bit.''
   To emphasize his point, the governor cited President Bush's veto
of civil rights legislation.
   Democratic concern about creation of a black district in
Virginia is based on the fact that its likeliest location would
strip blacks from the districts of Reps. Norman Sisisky, Lewis
Payne and Owen Pickett, all Democrats.
   Goldman referred to all three as ``good Democrats who have
worked hard for the party,'' and added that as party chairman he
would take a hard look at ``any lines that are drawn that would
affect them or make it harder for them to get elected.''
   Civil rights leaders contend that legally the Democrats have no
choice.
   Basing his view on a Supreme Court decision, Frank R. Parker,
director of the voting rights project of the Lawyers Committee,
said, ``If there is racially polarized voting and
minority-preferred candidates regularly are defeated, the failure
to create a majority blac where one can be created is a violation
of Section Two of the Voting Rights Act.''
   Parker acknowledged there is considerable disagreement over what
constitutes a ``majority black'' district.
   For example, in Alabama, Sanders said it would be possible to
create two districts in which 55 percent of the population would be
black.
   But in neither case would a majority of the voters be black and
``neither of them would be truly winnable in terms of a black
person,'' he said.
   ``I think we have to have one district, at least 65 percent
black,'' he said.
   Assemblyman David Gantt, chairman of the New York Assembly
reapportionment committee, said he was not prepared at this early
stage to speculate on the percentage needed for black majority
district .
   ``There is a varying attitude as to what constitutes a minority
district, whether you try to put 100 percent or 65 percent,'' he
said. ``I'm not sure where we will come down on that particular
issue.''
   Like other black Democratic elected officials, Gantt is wary of
forming alliances with Republicans.
   ``While we may win the battle we may end up losing the war,'' he
said. ``My understanding is they would like to take every minority
and put them into one district and ... they may also end up picking
up more conservative people in those areas contiguous to that.''

<HEAD>Factory Orders Inch Up, Would Have Dropped but for Oil Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Factory orders for manufactured goods inched
up 0.1 percent in September but would have fallen except for the
added cost of oil products, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department report points ``to a rather fragile
state of affairs in the manufacturing sector,'' Stephen S. Roach,
senior economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said.
   The department said orders of durable and non-d the report said. ``Excluding
petroleum, orders were down 1.1 percent.''
   Orders for durable goods - ``big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years - fell 1.4 percent to $125.2 billion after a
0.9 percent decline in August. It was their third drop in four
months.
   Non-durable goods orders, which include petroleum products,
advanced 1.6 percent to $119.3 billion in September. But excluding
oil, non-durable orders were down 0.7 percent.
   Non-durable orders had jumped 4.7 percent after the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. The department also blamed most of that
increase on petroleum price increases after the invasion disrupted
the world's oil supplies.
   ``Orders continue to show sluggish behavior in the manufacturing
sector,'' said Evalina Tainer, senior domestic economist with First
National Bank of Chicago. ``On the whole, I think we're moving
sideways.''
   Factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing
industry plans, and a decrease may forecaefense capital goods orders, a
barometer of business investment plans, turned up 7.0 percent to
$38.4 billion ``but didn't even offset last month's drop'' of 10.0
percent.
   Defense orders, which jumped 12.0 percent in August after the
Iraqi invasion, fell back 6.7 percent in September to $7.8 billion.
Excluding the defense category, orders rose 0.3 percent.
   All major durable categories posted declines except for
non-electrical machinery - up 6.2 percent to $22.7 billion. These
orders thus regained their 5.2 percent loss a month earlier.
   But transportation orders dropped 6.8 percent to $32.8 billion
after a 1.0 percent gain the previous month. A large decline for
motor vehicles helped offset a 20 percent increase in aircraft
orders. Excluding transportation, orders rose 1.2 percent.

   Romanians waited in long lines at
stores Wednesday, hoping to stock up the day before a tough
economic reform package frees prices on basic goods. But the wait
was in vain.
   Bucharest stores were nearly empty, and shoppers who joined
snaking lines for the few available items were angry and confused
by the planned changes.
   Most grumbled about lack of information on the reforms, and few
believed they would yield quick results.
   Car owners waited up to 10 hours at gas stations, despite
guarantees that gasoline and other energy prices would not
increase.
   Economics Minister Eugen Dijmarescu promised that the price
liberalization Thursday would not affect the cost of housing or
basic foodstuffs. But he did not specify which prices would be
raised or by how much, adding to the confusion.
   Such information was available, but apparently only on request.
   Commerce Ministry official Gheorghe Oana told a reporter that
prices of milk, bread, sugar, meats and other staples would not
rise before Jan. 1.
   But some food prices were to rise Thursday, with a kilogram (2.2
pounds) of carrots going from four lei (about 11 cents) to 10 lei,
for example, he said.
   On request, the Commerce Ministry provided figures reflecting a
doubling of prices Thursday for clothes, public transport and
furniture, among other items. Footwear and leather goods were to
triple, and postal and phone rates to rise by about 70 percent.
   But most Romanians had no access to such information.
   ``I'm upset we are being kept in the dark for so long,'' one
Bucharest man said. ``This is not at all what we were led to expect
in the election campaign.''
   The National Salvation Front, which took power in the December
revolution that ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
promised slow reforms and social protection. But after the Front
won overwhelmingly in May elections, Premier Petre Roman sped up
reform.
   In July, legislation was passed on selling failing state-owned
industries. Last month the government slashed their credits and
energy subsidies.
   In addition to the price reforms, the national currency was to
be devalued Thursday by more than 50 percent to encourage exports.
The rate will be 35 lei to the dollar.
   With the reforms already in place nibbling away on earnings and
wage increases still only a promise, some Romanians feared the
worst.
   ``All I know is that life is no longer affordable,'' Ioana
Ionescu, a cook, told a reporter.
   Another woman, working in Bucharest's only laundromat, said she
makes 2,300 lei a month, and the average wash now costs a fifth of
that.
   She charged that government arguments that prices must go up to
reflect market realities is merely a coverup, a view at least
partially shared by some experts.
   ``In the short term, companies are continuing the old habit of
raising prices to cover inefficient production and losses,'' said
Stefan Boboc, of Bucharest's Economic Studies Academy.
   But potential public rage over price hikes is likely to be muted
because many goods available on paper at low official prices have
in fact been lacking for years, except for a much higher price on
the black market.
   In an interview, Finance Ministry Price Director Constantin
Prigoreanu blamed ``both corruption and low production'' for the
scarcities.
   Production has dropped by more than 20 percent this year for a
variety of reasons that probably include less fear at the workplace
than under Ceausescu. Also, many store managers have been selling
under the counter for bribes.
   They are widely suspected of withholding goods until the new
prices come into effect.
   The government believes real market prices will kill the black
market and turn the economy around.
   But the country's emerging unions charge the reforms will only
harm consumers and not improve the economy, unless corrupt managers
who survived the Communist downfall are ousted.
   Viorel Marcu, president of the Bucharest chapter of the Drivers'
Union, said there was a thin layer of committed reformers at the
top.
   ``But under it rests a very thick layer of red, and these are
the people who we have to deal with,'' he said.

   Minnesota's conservative Republican
Party shelved its reservations about Arne Carlson and backed him
for governor in place of Jon Grunseth, who quit the race because of
sexual misconduct allegations.
   But the party's 14-member executive committee Tuesday left the
question of Carlson's running mate to the Minnesota Supreme Court.
   Carlson wants Joanell Dyrstad, his running mate in the September
primary. But Sharon Clark, who was Grunseth's running mate, has
refused to step aside.
   Clark today filed a petition with the Minnesota Supreme Court
seeking a hearing to determine whether she has the right to the
second spot on the ticket or whether Carlson can make his own
choice.
   ``What if a governor and lieutenant governor were running
together, and the lieutenant governor decided to step down? Does
that mean the governor candidate has to step down also?'' Clark
said Tuesday.
   With only a week to go before Tuesday's election, the GOP
executive committee voted unanimously to unite behind Carlson, even
though many consider the state auditor too liberal, said party Bob
Weinholzer. Carlson supports abortion rights.
   ``We encourage all Republicans to support Arne Carlson,''
Weinholzer said.
   Under the law, Carlson, as runner-up in the primary, would have
become the GOP candidate anyway after Grunseth withdrew amid
allegations he had an affair and swam nude with teen-age girls.
Grunseth has disputed the allegations.
   Carlson, who had jumped into the race last week as a write-in
candidate as pressure mounted on Grunseth to drop out, faces
three-term Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   Weinholzer said the party had no choice but to let the Supreme
Court decide on Carlson's running mate.
   ``We have said that Arne Carlson is our candidate for governor.
We are supporting him,'' Weinholzer said. ``He has picked his
lieutenant governor. The court may decide to overturn it. That is
out of our hands.''

   Thousands of ethnic Moldavians attacked
checkpoints on the frontier with Romania on Wednesday, vowing to
``wipe border posts off the face of the Earth,'' the official
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The militants, who seek closer ties to Romania, threatened to
kill border guards and their families unless the Kremlin withdraws
troops sent to Moldavia last week to enforce a state of emergency,
Tass said.
   Tass did not mention any casualties. It said the militants threw
stones and set fire to a fence but relinquished control of the two
checkpoints after speaking with Moldavian leaders.
   Part of Moldavia was Romanian territory until it was annexed by
the Soviets during World War II. Some ethnic Moldavians, many of
them Romanians by birth or descent, want to secede from the Soviet
Union and rejoin Romania. However, the Gagauz, an ethnic minority
numbering about 150,000, want to secede from Moldavia.
   Wednesday's border unrest was the first reported violence since
the Gagauz minority began its secession drive last month.

   Romania's president, meanwhile, told Austrian television his

Romanians are concerned about ethnic Romanians in the Soviet Union
but do not seek to revise the borders.

   Tass said 3,000 militants stormed the border checkpoints.
However, the independent news agency Interfax put the number of
militants at 7,000. The discrepancy could not be resolved
immediately.
   ``The militants pelted the Stoyanovka checkpoint with stones and
then set the fence around it on fire,'' Tass said. Stoyanovka is a
town on the border with Romania.
   Moldavian leaders flew to the scene and persuaded the militants
to surrender the two checkpoints they were blocking, Tass said
without providing details. It did not say if both checkpoints were
in Stoyanovka.
   The Gagauz, descendants of Christians who fled religious
persecution in Turkey 160 years ago, claimed control over part of
Moldavia in October. They feared rising Moldavian nationalism and
were angry over a law making Moldavian the republic's official
language.
   Last week, the Gagauz began elections for an autonomous
government. Ethnic Moldavians opposed the move, and the elections
were called off Saturday after talks between Gagauz representatives
and a Soviet-Moldavian committee.
   The legislature of the Gagauz republic, which Moldavia's
parliament declared unconstitutional, elected a president on
Tuesday. He is Stepan Topal, a 52-year-old civil engineer.
   The militants who attacked the frontier checkpoints Wednesday
also threatened to go to the Moldavian capital of Kishinev ``to
restore order,'' according to Tass.
   The Moldavian Interior Ministry, reached by telephone in
Kishinev, declined to comment on the unrest.
   Moldavia's Communist Party Central Committee issued a statement
condemning use of ``power methods to solve national, political and
other conflicts by stirring up passions and mass psychosis.'' It
condemned seizures of party buildings in several towns in the
republic.
   In June, tens of thousands of Romanians and Moldavians forced
open several border crossings on the anniversary of Moscow's
annexation of the region. In May, tens of thousands of Romanians
streamed across eight bridges on a border river for the first time
in more than a half-century.

   Mechanical glitches are plaguing a trial
run of the Army's chemical weapons incinerator on this Pacific
island, but officials expect to finish destroying deadly stockpiles
on schedule.
   It's been a rough first few months for the Johnston Atoll
Chemical Agent Disposal System, the first of nine incinerators
planned to rid the United States of its aging chemical weapons.
   The high-tech incinerator, criticized by Pacific island leaders
and environmental groups, has operated just 22 percent of the time
since testing began in June, officials said.
   The Army conducted the first media tour of the island and the
incinerator plant Tuesday. About 70 reporters and photographers
were given a tour.
   The $240 million plant was built to destroy 300,000 aging
chemical weapons moved here from Okinawa in 1971 and 100,000 rounds
en route from Germany - 6.6 percent of the U.S. stockpile - at this
flat, windswept island 800 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   About 1,300 people - civilian contract workers at the plant and
military members - live on the island, which has no indigenous
population.
   The Environmental Protection Agency will decide whether to allow
the Army to destroy more weapons after the test period is completed
late next year. The operation is expected to wind up by 1995.
   Charles Baronian, deputy program manager for the plant, said
officials had hoped to have the plant working 70 percent of the
time during a 16-month test. Although the glitches won't doom the
program, Baronian called them ``very depressing for an engineer.''
   ``It's not unusual for a brand new plant to have these kinds of
problems,'' Baronian said. ``However, we're seeing more of these
types of problems than frankly we anticipated.''
   The main problem, Baronian said, is debris jamming a conveyor
that carries away nerve gas rocket parts after incineration. Any
breakdown in the system shuts down the entire plant.
   The glitches do not release any nerve gas and do not endanger
plant employees. Still, Baronian said plant managers would rather
err on the side of caution and shut down for any problem, no matter
how minor.
   The Army will use what it learns from this plant at eight
planned mainland incinerators that are to destroy all aging weapons
by 1997, as required by Congress.
   Those plant sites are Umatilla, Ore.; Tooele, Utah; Pueblo,
Colo.; Newport, Ind.; Aberdeen, Md.; Anniston, Ala.; Lexington,
Ky.; and Pine Bluff, Ark. The Army decided the safest plan was to
build incinerators where the weapons are stored.
   Besides the breakdowns, the project has suffered from a public
relations problem. Some Pacific leaders openly worry the plant may
be used to incinerate hazardous waste and chemical munitions from
mainland storage sites.
   The South Pacific Forum, an organization of regional
governments, claims the use of Johnston Atoll could make the region
``the toxic waste disposal center of the world.''
   President Bush addressed those concerns Saturday when he met in
Honolulu with leaders of 11 Pacific nations. Bush told them the
United States is following strict environmental guidelines and will
use the plant only on weapons already on Johnston Island and those
from Europe. A small cache of World War II-era weapons also will be
brought from the Solomon Islands.
   Brig. Gen. Walter L. Busbee, program manager for chemical
demilitarization, said Johnston would be out of the chemical
weapons business when incineration winds up in 1994.
   He said the plant would be unable to operate safely beyond 1994
without extensive renovation, and would not have the capacity to
handle weapons from other sites. He also cited the prohibitive
costs of operating such a large complex at such a remote location.
   The plant was running during Tuesday's two-hour tour, and
destroyed 79 M-55 nerve gas rockets before reporters left the
island. The plant has destroyed about 3,500 rockets since June.

   Female impersonator Craig Russell has died of a
stroke resulting from AIDS, a hospital official said today. He was
42.
   The actor died Tuesday night at Toronto Western Hospital,
according to spokeswoman Lucie Baistrocchi.
   Russell became an international box office success with the 1977
movie ``Outrageous,'' a low-budget, semi-autobiographical film in
which he performed many of his impersonations, especially of his
idol, Mae West.
   He acted in nightclubs and on television after that, and in 1986
did a sequel to his film hit called ``Too Outrageous.''
   Born in Toronto, Russell began his performing career on the
city's homosexual club circuit and was also known for his
impersonations of Judy Garland, Bette Davis and other Hollywood
stars.
   At age 17, he lived in Ms. West's house in Los Angeles and
worked for a time as her part-time secretary.
   His survivors and funeral plans were not immediately known.

   The Big Three television networks plan election
night coverage in varying degrees of depth, but the Cable News
Network is planning its most intensive coverage of an off-year
election.
   ABC and NBC plan their principal coverage in hour-long news
specials at 10 p.m. EST, followed by local news at 11 p.m.; CBS
plans a two-hour show, from 9 to 11 p.m., and all three plan 11:30
p.m. wrapup reports.
   CNN's main coverage runs from 7 p.m. EST to 1 a.m., when its
90-minute wrapup show begins. Its final wrapup is at 3 a.m. ``This
is the most extensive coverage we've had in an off year,'' said CNN
spokeswoman Melinda McIntire.
   As they did in the last off-year elections in 1986, NBC and ABC
are leading into full-time coverage with prime time shows; CBS, the
only network that filled all of prime time with its coverage in
'86, has cut back an hour.
   This year, CBS pre-empts its ``Tuesday Night Movie,'' while NBC
and ABC, respectively, pre-empt ``Law and Order'' and
``thirtysomething.''
   Cliff Kappler, NBC's senior producer of news specials, said
technology has cut the time networks must devote to elections. ``I
think it compares favorably to the amount of ground that we cover,
but we will do it in an infinitely quicker time,'' he said.
   This is the first year that all four networks pool resources for
exit polling and winner projections, in a $12 million joint venture
called Voter Research and Surveys, or VRS.
   VRS gives each network polls and projections for all Senate,
House and governor's races, and state and local races of national
interest, such as the Washington, D.C., mayor's race and
California's propositions.
   The exit polls ``provide demographic profiles of each
candidate's constituents and the role of issues, such as abortion
and President Bush's performance, in shaping voters' choice for
office,'' CBS said.
   ABC has scheduled two special reports of between three and five
minutes by David Brinkley between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST, when the
network opens its main coverage anchored by Peter Jennings.
   NBC News offers brief reports between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST.
Then, at 10 p.m., Tom Brokaw will anchor ``Decision '90,'' with
analysis by John Chancellor.
   NBC will provide analysis of the elections with Ron Brown,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Ed Rollins,
co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
   CBS' special coverage, anchored by Dan Rather in New York City,
opens at 8 p.m. EST with a seven-minute report. From 9 p.m. to 11
p.m., CBS offers its ``Campaign '90: Election Night.''
   Serious election night junkies will tune into CNN, which opens
its coverage at 6:30 p.m. EST with its principal Washington anchor,
Bernard Shaw, for an election night preview edition of ``The World
Today.''
   The main coverage begins at 7 p.m.
   CNN's political commentators will include analyst Frederick
Allen, political columnist William Schneider of the Los Angeles
Times, and Patrick Buchanan, Michael Kinsley, Robert Novak and Mark
Shields.

<HEAD>Iraqis Looting Abandoned Embassies, Asians Died of Starvation</HEAD>

   Iraqi troops are looting abandoned
embassies in Kuwait and some Asian workers trapped in the country
have died of starvation, an escaped Kuwaiti businessman said
Wednesday.
   The businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
U.N. blockade against Iraq would fail because Jordanian trucks are
bringing in fresh vegetables and in any case, the Iraqis are used
to hardship.
   He said he escaped in an eight-car convoy which took two days to
cover a 30-mile trip. His claims could not be independently
verified but other escapees have described similar conditions.
   At a news conference, he painted a picture of a looted and
frightened Kuwait with almost no food available.
   ``Asians were the number one casualties of starvation,'' he
said. ``I've seen with my own eyes, some of these laborers digging
garbage and looking for food.''
   Thousands of Asians were kept in a compound without food and
water for 10 days after the Aug. 2 invasion and nobody knows how
many died, he said.
   ``My company had a thousand Asian workers. The first few days,
they were surrounded and not allowed to go to their camp or any
place. Many of them were sick and God knows how many were dead, not
by bullet or anything, but by starvation,'' he said.
   ``All the hospitals are functioning only for emergency and what
the doctor can do with his bare hands. There's no medicine.
Nothing,'' he said.
   The Iraqi army is digging in and camping in schools. Anyone
caught with more than a week's supply of food or harboring a
foreigner is immediately executed, he said.
   Kuwaitis are being pressured to become Iraqi citizens and every
week, about 100 Iraqi families arrive to move into houses left by
fleeing Kuwaitis.
   ``We are waiting for a big hit,'' he said. ``Nobody is believing
in the peaceful solution.''
   The Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait may be tired but they are fiercely
loyal to Saddam Hussein. They are used to living on meals of dry
bread, tea and perhaps some cheese ``if they are good,'' he said.
   ``They've been living on that for the past eight years,'' he
said referring to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. ``Do you expect the
blockade is going to work on them?''
   ``Jordanian trucks are all over Kuwait,'' he said. ``I saw them
bringing vegetables and taking furniture and computers and hi-tech
stuff back.''
   He also said Iraqi soldiers had stripped a year's supply of food
from Kuwaiti warehouses, and that he had watched abandoned
embassies being looted.
   ``For every embassy he (Saddam) surrounded after they leave, he
takes every possession inside the embassy,'' he said.
   After annexing Kuwait, Saddam ordered diplomats to move to
Baghdad. Then, he cut water and electricity supplies and refused to
let any food into the diplomatic compounds. Only the United States
and Britain still have diplomats in Kuwait City.
   The businessman said that many Kuwaitis who have held out since
the invasion now want to leave as Saddam increases pressure on them
to become Iraqi citizens.
   Saddam has cut gasoline supplies to any car with Kuwaiti license
plates. ``To be able to get gasoline you had to change your tag
from Kuwaiti to Iraq-Kuwait, you have to have Iraqi citizenship,''
the businessman said.
   ``And if you change it, that means you have to be drafted,'' he
said.
   The businessman said the Iraqis had looted every piece of
high-technology and construction equipment. Some trucks and
bulldozers taken by the army got an instant khaki paint job.
   The only thing left in the Highway Patrol Department, he said,
is ``the floor and the ceiling.''
   The Iraqis also carted away satellite equipment from the
Department of Communications worth about $1 billion, he said.
   ``Even the light poles are pulled out. Street signs have been
pulled out, because it's big, high value. It's made out of
aluminum,'' he said.
   ``In the last days, he started even collecting scrap metal from
damaged cars ... for his defense industry,'' he said.
   ``They put us back 50 years,'' he said. ``It's going to take at
least, to my point of view, 25 years of building to repair the
damage that has been done in Kuwait.''

<HEAD>Bare-Knuckle Fights in the Mother of Parliaments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be the Mother of Parliaments. But lately
the House of Commons sounds more like the school yard.
   Having denounced opposition leader Neil Kinnock last week as a
``crypto-Communist,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is now
taunting him about his height.
   The exchange came on Tuesday, with Mrs. Thatcher feeling
combative after another one-woman battle with the other 11 leaders
of the European Community. The issue was a single European currency
and closer political ties. Mrs. Thatcher's position, as she
summarized it for the house, was ``NO, NO, NO.''
   Kinnock had disturbed the prime minister by inviting her to
declare her support for Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe,
who politely disagrees with Mrs. Thatcher's opposition to a single
European currency.
   ``The deputy prime minister is too big a man to need a little
man like you to stand up for him,'' Mrs. Thatcher barked at the
5-foot-9 Kinnock.
   Kinnock attempted a counter-punch. ``Don't you appreciate that
even now your tantrum tactics won't stop the process of change?''
he asked Mrs. Thatcher.
   Kinnock, she retorted, would have abandoned Britain's
sovereignty and its coinage ``for the sake of being little Sir Echo
and saying, `me too.'''
   Mrs. Thatcher is 4{ inches shorter than Kinnock, but with high
heels and an imperious manner she somehow looks taller when glaring
at the Labor Party leader across the table that divides the
Commons.
   On Wednesday, the newspaper pundits declared Mrs. Thatcher the
winner.
   She prevailed, wrote Matthew Parris of The Times, ``by neither
reason nor persuasion and certainly by no felicity of language. It
was won by self-assurance, and by just standing there and
shouting.''
   The Commons has always been prone to rowdiness.
   But it's getting worse, especially during the twice-weekly,
15-minute sessions known as prime minister's question time.
   ``She has lost all inhibition,'' said Andy Roth, an American who
edits a House of Commons' in-house bible, Parliamentary Profiles.
   ``What makes it worse now is the particularly bad relationship
between Thatcher and Kinnock,'' he added in an interview.
   ``Most of them are brought up on the Oxford Union debating
tradition of `You're a moron, I'm a genius.' But quite often they
have a good relationship outside Parliament. With these two there's
nothing. It's become a bare-knuckle fight.''
   Even abuse has its formalities: members refer to each other as
the Honorable Gentlemen or the Honorable Lady.
   It makes for bizarre combinations.
   In an exchange about Iraq, Labor lawmaker Andrew Faulds urged
Mrs. Thatcher to try negotiations, and then sputtered: ``You
stupid, negative woman.''
   ``I seem to hear the stench of appeasement in the air, the
rather nauseating stench of appeasement,'' Mrs. Thatcher replied.
   ``You love war!'' Faulds shouted, and Speaker Bernard Weatherill
had had enough.
   ``That is very bad behavior from the honorable gentleman,''
Weatherill admonished. ``He must not shout in that way.''
   All around, Laborites and Tories shouted at each other and
pandemonium raged. Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker sat
behind Mrs. Thatcher, distractedly chewing a rolled up Order Paper
in between dutiful, supportive smiles.
   That's the British Parliament, the 1,000-year-old body which, as
Mrs. Thatcher bayed above the tumult, has shown the way in war and
peace.
   ``I believe the traditions and example of this House have gone
the world over, with admiration,'' she said. ``I believe they have
served not only this country well, but served Europe well ... this
House kept sitting when the lights of Europe went out.''

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Will Abandon Military Role, Hungarian Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After menacing the West with Soviet-led
military might for more than three decades, the Warsaw Pact
reportedly will cease to exist as a military alliance next year.
   A senior Hungarian official said Wednesday the six-nation
alliance would end joint military maneuvers in December and would
stop operating as a military alliance in June.
   Thereafter, the Waraw Pact would function ``only as a political
forum,'' he added. The official, who spoke to selected reporters on
condition of anonymity, gave no further details.
   The Warsaw Pact was formed in 1955 in the early years of the
Cold War as a Soviet response to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. Originally comprised of the Soviet Union, Albania,
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and
Romania, the alliance was reduced to seven members after Albania
withdrew in 1968.
   The pact began to lose cohesion with the start of liberalization
within the Soviet Union. That led to the advent of democracy in
East Europe last year and a further weakening of the alliance,
which was reduced to six members with the unification of Germany.
   At nearly completed conventional arms talks with the 16-nation
NATO, Warsaw Pact members are basically negotiating as individual
countries. The pact nations often advocate positions closer to
those of the West than to Moscow.
   The Kremlin is withdrawing its forces from several former
satellites, including Hungary, which was among the East bloc
nations that ousted the Communist Party last year.
   Col. Anatoli Kirilov, deputy commander of the Soviet troops in
Hungary, said Wednesday that all his soldiers would be out of the
country by June 30, 1991, as scheduled under an agreement signed in
March.
   By late October, more than half the 50,000 Soviet troops had
left, the state MTI news agency reported.
   Hungary announced earlier it would leave the military arm of the
Warsaw Pact next year unless the military functions ceased. Last
week, Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel said the pact's military
structure would be abolished and turned into a body with a
``consultative political function,'' the Czechoslovak state news
agency said.

   Seven years after New York theatrical
producer Roy Radin was shot to death in the midst of a movie deal,
the lights went up today on the ``Cotton Club'' case, a tale of
drugs and greed in 1980s Hollywood.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn opened the trial by telling
the jury he would prove that three men on trial killed Radin on the
orders of reputed Miami cocaine dealer and chief defendant Karen
DeLayne ``Laney'' Greenberger.
   The trial is expected to explore deal making in Hollywood, its
ties to the cocaine trade and how Hustler magazine publisher Larry
Flynt's private militia got involved.
   The prosecutor alleged that Mrs. Greenberger, 43, ordered the
killing because she was being cut out of profits from ``The Cotton
Club'' movie deal she had helped organize between Radin and
producer Robert Evans.
   ``Each of the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap
and kill Roy Radin,'' Conn said. ``And each defendant did it for
one purpose only, for financial gain and for their own personal
greed.''
   On trial are Mrs. Greenberger and three former bodyguards for
Flynt. All four defendants could face the death penalty.
   The jury was told how Radin was taken to a remote canyon and
shot at least 10 times in the head. Conn said a stick of dynamite
was then placed in Radin's mouth and ignited to destroy his face
and prevent identification.
   Prosecutors contend Greenberger's feeling that she was being
pushed out of any profits from the movie deal and a dispute over
stolen cocaine led her to hire William Mentzer, 41, her former
boyfriend, and Alex Marti, 29, to do away with Radin.
   The fourth defendant is Robert Lowe, 44. He is accused of
driving the limousine that took Radin to his appointment with
death.
   Radin, 33, has been described by witnesses as an obese,
cocaine-sniffing impresario who sought to expand his show business
connections to Hollywood.
   Among those on the witness list is Demond Wilson, former star of
television's ``Sanford and Son.'' He was a cocaine-sniffing buddy
of Radin and was with him hours before the slaying. Wilson has
since become a minister.
   In 1983, Mrs. Greenberger introduced Radin to Evans, the
producer of such films as ``Chinatown'' and ``Marathon Man'' and
former head of production at Paramount Pictures. Soon, Mrs.
Greenberger was demanding a share of the profits from ``The Cotton
Club.''
   Radin was last seen May 13, 1983, stepping into a limousine with
Mrs. Greenberger en route to a business dinner in Beverly Hills.
They never arrived.
   A month later, Radin's body was found in a dry riverbed 65 miles
north of Los Angeles - a location identified in testimony as a
frequent target shooting range for the Flynt bodyguards. He had
been shot repeatedly in the head.
   The case remained a mystery until 1988, when prosecutors filed
charges. New evidence from William Rider, former head of Flynt's
security force, linked the defendants to the murder through
statements he said they made in his presence.
   Rider also implicated Evans, who invoked his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a
preliminary hearing last year.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's `Had It' With Iraqi Mistreatment of Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared Wednesday ``I have had
it'' with Iraq's mistreatment of American hostages but said the
United States has not moved closer to war.
   He also said he was willing to wait longer for economic
sanctions to hurt Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Bush expressed disappointment that the sanctions have not had
more impact on Saddam. ``I know some of our partners thought that
the economic pressure by now would have come close to compelling
him to withdraw,'' he said. ``I've not had a view on that.''
   The president also voiced unhappiness that representative of
other countries are traveling to Baghdad to deal with Saddam on
hostages and the gulf crisis.
   ``Every time somebody sends an emissary, that gives Saddam
Hussein a little bit of hope that there might be some way that he
can stop short of doing what he must do - get out of Kuwait
unconditionally, free these people that are being held against
their will and have the legitimate government restored,'' Bush
said.
   The president did not single out any country, but officials from
the Soviet Union, France and Britain have visited Iraq recently.
   The president used two news conferences and a political speech
to turn up the verbal heat on Iraq. It was the third consecutive
day of blistering attack by Bush against Saddam.
   Bush heatedly rejected suggestions that he was trying to divert
attention from the budget debacle that sent his poll ratings into a
nose dive just before important congressional elections.
   ``I don't think any decent, honorable person would ever suggest
anything of that nature,'' Bush said, adding that he was offended
by the suggestion.
   With 250,000 American troops poised for conflict in the gulf,
Congress is pressing Bush to allow more time for sanctions to work.
   Administration officials said Bush's saber-rattling was intended
to signal Saddam that the United States is not bluffing and to call
attention to the plight of American hostages.
   In particular, Bush deplored the conditions endured by American
diplomats in Kuwait, where Iraqi forces have cut off water, power
and food to the U.S. Embassy.
   ``Our people inside are being starved by a brutal dictator,''
Bush said. ``And do you think I'm concerned about it? You're darn
right I am.
   ``And what am I going to do about it? Let's just wait and see.
Because I have had it with that kind of treatment of Americans.''
   Bush said he did not know how long the diplomats could hold out
before they might be forced to withdraw. He said that if Iraq
blocked a resupply effort, ``it would be directly contravening a
mandate from the United Nations and we would view that very
seriously.''
   Speaking about the U.N. sanctions, Bush said they had not been
``totally effective.''
   He said, ``I am prepared at this juncture to wait to see if
economic sanctions will work - at this juncture.''
   Bush said he did not know how long he would wait. ``There's no
date of that nature in mind,'' he said.
   The State Department said there were ``some signs of real
shortages'' in Iraq in industrial goods, raw materials, machinery
and other products. The embargo on oil exports is costing Baghdad
$2.5 billion a month, based on a $31 a barrel price, said
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``No one can say at this point how rapidly these shortages will
translate into meaningful decisions, particularly since Saddam
Hussein has made clear this his army will be the last to be touched
by shortages and that he does not care how much the people of Iraq
may suffer to protect that army,'' she said.
   She cited press reports that American hostages were being
singled out for particularly harsh treatment. ``We understand that
conditions are appalling in some detention facilities.''
   Miss Tutwiler quoted returning Western hostages as saying that
Miles Hoffman, an American who was shot while trying to evade
capture by Iraqi forces, was in deteriorating condition and in
serious need of medical care.
   She said Iraq has ignored U.S. demands for the immediate
evacuation of all Americans, particularly the sick. ``Detainees
with medical needs, like Mr. Hoffman, have become the victims of
Saddam Hussein's barbaric `guest' policy,'' she said.
   At a separate news conference, Iraq's Ambassador, Mohamed
Al-Mashat, indicated Iraq will not allow supplies to be shipped to
the embassy in Kuwait. ``We have said time and time again there is
no reason for those embassies to be there,'' Al-Mashat said. Only
the British and the Americans have kept their embassies open in
Kuwait City.
   Bush said his tough comments are not intended as a rationale for
military action.
   ``You don't use pretext when you have force deployed. ... You
don't need any pretext, you just do what's right. I am concerned
about the lives of Americans held against their will.''
   In another development, Bush met at the White House with Vatican
Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush expressed
appreciation for the Vatican's support for the U.N. sanctions.
   ``Both leaders expressed the hope that a peaceful resolution to
the current crisis could be found,'' Fitzwater said.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem factions agreed to
begin a cease-fire Wednesday and withdraw forces, but past truces
quickly collapsed and some officials wonder how much control the
warlords are willing to relinquish.
   Police reported the cease-fire between the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal movement
began at midnight. Their three-year battle has killed at least
1,100 since June 1987, police estimate.
   A joint communique indicated they expect further meetings to
discuss a possible prisoner exchange pending ``a comprehensive and
final settlement under the auspices of Syria and Iran.''
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio said Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was due in the Syrian capital of
Damascus this week to work on ``an agreement putting an end to the
Amal-Hezbollah dispute.''
   The pact bolstered President Elias Hrawi's efforts to implement
an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's 15-year-old
civil war, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives.
   The government said efforts to demilitarize Beirut and
surrounding hills is ``progressing quickly.''
   There have been dozens of failed cease-fires in the feud for
control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect.
   The present cease-fire was called after meetings between senior
leaders of the two factions. The talks in Anjar, east of Beirut,
were attended by Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Lebanon, and Iran's Ambassador to Syria,
Mohammad Akhtari.
   Hezbollah, which is blamed for many terrorist attacks, is
considered to be the umbrella organization for extremist groups
holding foreign hostages in Lebanon, including six Americans.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said fighters of both factions still hold their
positions in south Lebanon, where some of the worst clashes took
place.
   ``We don't expect them to withdraw unless Syria and Iran succeed
in working out a political settlement to the conflict,'' the
spokesman said.
   Hezbollah and Amal say they will withdraw fighters from a
15-mile coastal strip that includes Beirut.
   Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul announced earlier Wednesday
that the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia, led by Samir
Geagea, also agreed to withdraw from the war-battered capital.
   The other main militia, the Druse Moslem Progressive Socialist
Party led by Walid Jumblatt, has also consented to pull out of the
city.
   ``We break the good news to the Lebanese people, who are longing
for peace,'' Dalloul announced after a five-hour meeting with
Geagea and Defense Minister Albert Mansour.
   Dalloul, a Shiite, and Defense Minister Albert Mansour, a Greek
Orthodox Catholic, have been assigned by the government to
negotiate the militia withdrawal.
   The government has not yet set a deadline for the withdrawal,
but Hrawi is expected to press for it as soon as possible.
   Hrawi announced the plan after the Syrian army and Lebanese
troops crushed rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's forces in an
eight-hour offensive Oct. 13.
   Morethan 500 people, including about 200 Syrian soldiers, were
killed and 1,200 wounded.
   The collapse of Aoun, who fled to refuge in the French Embassy,
removed a major obstacle to the peace plan Hrawi was elected last
November to implement.
   Aoun opposed the accord because it did not guarantee a complete
withdrawal by Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon, who he considered
an army of occupation. Aoun and Hrawi are Maronite Catholics, who
have dominated Lebaneses politics since the nation's independence
from France in 1943.
   The Syrians have said they will pull out of Beirut and other
cities to the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon within six months of
the plan being implemented.
   But many believe other rival commanders fear making the first
move to withdraw and leave their forces exposed to attack.
   Geagea, for instance, faces threats from Syrian-backed
Christians.
   Jumblatt, whose 200,000-member Druse sect if one of the smallest
in Lebanon, has been critical of Hrawi's government and has vowed
to keep government authority from extending to his stronghold in
the Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut.

<HEAD>Aquino Battles A Troublesom Free Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino once counted
the press as an ally in her fight against the late Ferdinand
Marcos. Now, she feels like a victim of ``journalistic
oppression.''
   She told members of the Foreign Correspondents Association of
the Philippines on Tuesday that her administration's greatest
political contribution was the restoration of democracy, notably
press freedom, after nearly two decades of authoritarian rule.
   ``In that fight, of course, we had the help of a host of local
and foreign newsmen,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Yet, when the dust of
battle settled, one realized almost immediately that the press was
never really a combatant, never truly an ally; that it was on the
front lines only as observer.''
   ``The press,'' she said, ``is not only an inconstant ally, it is
also not a proper one and is an impractical one. Not only is it
contentious; it is, at its best, critical - of organized
government, of history, of humanity itself.''
   Mrs. Aquino was thrust into politics and into the anti-Marcos
movement after her husband, the former Sen. Benigno Aquino, was
murdered in August 1983 on his return from exile to lead the
opposition.
   The local and the foreign press portrayed Mrs. Aquino as a
grieving widow, a simple housewife who was a reluctant challenger
to Marcos, and later as a champion of democracy after a ``people
power revolution'' in February 1986 swept her to power.
   In the aftermath of the revolt, newspapers mushroomed, and a
dozen talk shows competed for television and radio air time.
Meanwhile, an army of reporters and photographers hounded Mrs.
Aquino wherever she went.
   In the beginning, the presidential palace tolerated the
familiarity of the press towards Mrs. Aquino. The president,
sometimes addressed by her nickname, Cory, fielded questions during
what reporters call ``ambush'' or curbside interviews.
   But after a series of coup attempts involving Marcos loyalist
officers and later military reformists who plotted the overthrow of
the late president, security was tightened and such interviewa were
not allowed.
   The move was understood, but with resentment among some
reporters and columnists, who felt presidential aides were taking
the first steps in throwing a ``cordon sanitaire'' that deprived
Mrs. Aquino of feeling the real pulse of the people.
   Then, numerous government scandals broke out, dominating the
headlines and talk shows. Slowly, the criticism hurled at Cabinet
and other government officials was reaching Mrs. Aquino herself.
   Some of Mrs. Aquino's bitterest critics in the local press were
among those who had marched with her in anti-Marcos demonstrations.
A common theme of their attacks is that her government lacks
direction and is just as corrupt as that of Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino has often complained that the press today does not
report on the achievements of her government and the effort it is
making to improve the lives of ordinary Filipinos.
   She says that sometimes, officials feel that ``the country we
read about is not the Philippines but a terrible, cursed land in an
outlandish world created by the imagination of reporters and
columnists.''
   But Mrs. Aquino has not indicated she is sorry she fought to
restore press freedom.
   ``Nevertheless,'' she said, ``the sometimes abusive and
sometimes licentious press that we sometimes have is preferable to
a controlled press that reflects only one side of the news.''
   She said that there has been no indication of media repression.
``In fact,'' she said, ``the reverse could be true and the harassed
government could be the one feeling a bit of journalistic
oppression.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Up 1.1 Percent, More Than Double Income Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' consumer spending jumped 1.1
percent in September, the government said Wednesday, outpacing a
0.5 percent growth in personal income and contributing to the
lowest savings rate in three years.
   The Commerce Department report ``shows consumer purchasing power
obviously is under intense pressure in the aftermath of the
(Persian Gulf) oil shock,'' said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist
with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Nevertheless, Roach added, ``Consumers are really sort of
clinging tenaciously to their lifestyles. Their spending is holding
up just fine.''
   However, the Federal Reserve reported separately on Wednesday
that consumers' and businesses' confidence in the eonomy was
waning in many regions of the country. Every one of the central
bank's 12 districts was reporting either slower growth or an actual
decline in economic activity.
   ``Most districts reported that retailers were generally
pessimistic. ... (They) blamed lower consumer confidence brought on
by greater uncertainty and higher fuel prices,'' said the Federal
Reserve's report based on information collected through Oct. 19.
   The Commerce Department said that Americans' incomes reached a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.70 trillion in September, a
$23.8 billion increase over August.
   At the same time, it said spending reached a rate of $3.73
trillion, up $39.9 billion from a month earlier. It was the biggest
increase since a 1.2 percent gain last June.
   In its report on the third-quarter gross national product on
Tuesday, the department had said consumer spending from July
through September rose 3.6 percent, well above the 0.2 percent
advance from April through June.
   But Roach said spending will drop to ``the 1 percent vicinity''
during the current quarter.
   ``There's no way we'll be able to hold (the 3.6 percent pace) up
in the weak income and low savings environment,'' he said.
   Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity and Roach said the lower level of consumption this quarter
means a temporary decline in overall economic growth.
   But he said his company was not projecting two consecutive
quarters of declining gross national product, the total output of
the nation's goods and services.
   The Commerce report said the rate of Americans' savings as a
percent of disposable income fell to 3.5 percent, down from 4.1
percent in August and the lowest since a 3.3 percent rate in
October 1987.
   The report said Americans' income after taxes increased 0.4
percent, up from a 0.2 percent gain in August.
   The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation.
When adjusted, spending rose 0.3 percent after declining 0.1
percent in August. Disposable, or after-tax, income fell 0.3
percent on top of a 0.5 percent drop the previous month.
   A key component of the income category - wages and salaries -
rose $17.4 billion, up from $600 million the previous month.
   The $39.9 billion increase in personal consumption, which
includes everything except interest payments on debt, was up from a
$20.1 billion gain in August.
   Spending on durable goods - ``big-ticket'' items expected to
last more than three years - totaled $487 billion, up from $477
billion from August.
   Non-durable spending rose $11 billion to $1.2 trillion following
a $10.6 billion gain in August. Spending on services was up $18.2
billion to $2.0 trillion after a $18.2 billion gain the previous
month.

   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Chuck Berry is suing the
magazine High Society, saying it published stolen nude photos of
him with several women.
   In the suit filed Monday in St. Louis Circuit Court, Berry
claims that the magazine published eight photographs of him posing
with unidentified nude women as the cover story for its January
edition.
   The suit says the photos were stolen, and claims their
publication violated Berry's privacy.
   An official of the magazine who declined to give his name said
the magazine would not comment because it had not been served with

<HEAD>Looting Soldiers Block Food Aid Among Starving Liberians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looting and pillaging by the
remnants of Liberian Army units have disrupted food distribution in
areas where dozens of people die each day of starvation, relief
workers said Wednesday.
   Soliders of slain President Samuel Doe's army roam freely
through eastern Monrovia and man roadblocks alongside troops from a
five-nation West African task force sent to end Liberia's
10-month-old civil war.
   Refugees who fled to neighboring Ivory Coast claim the soldiers
and West African troops are looting what little is left in the
capital city's eastern suburbs.
   ``As soon as the food distribution started last week, the
soldiers just moved in and took the rice from civilians. We had to
stop giving it out,'' said a European aid worker. He said they
hoped to resume distribution this week.
   The first substantial food shipment arrived last Thursday, but
security precautions have slowed offloading of 1,930 tons of rice
from the United States and 600 tons from the U.N. World Food
Program.
   Between 50 and 60 people are dying every day in Monrovia from
starvation and diseases caused by malnutrition and lack of water,
said Joe Goettia, deputy assistant director with the U.S. Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance.
   ``People are dying like flies,'' said Belgian Dr. Pieter
Rykelykhuizen of Doctors Without Borders, an aid group.
   Between 10,000 and 13,000 civilians have died in the war between
the three Liberian factions, the office said.
   The unrest began when rebel forces led by Charles Taylor invaded
from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. Doe was killed during fighting in
September between his troops and forces loyal to Prince Johnson,
head of a splinter rebel group.
   Taylor's forces control most of the nation and he has declared
himself president.
   Johnson on Tuesday threatened to break a cease-fire with the
remnants of Doe's troops unless the West Africans force the
soldiers back to their barracks, reports from Monrovia said.
   It was unclear why the West Africans are accompanied by Doe's
troops. No immediate comment was available from the West African
force, which includes Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Gambia.
   Some opponents note the multinational command has been taken
over by Nigerians, and its president, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida,
supported Doe.
   ``If Nigeria wants to try a Vietnam-type of war like the
Americans, they can try, but we have absolutely no intention of
surrendering our sovereignty to Nigeria,'' Taylor chief spokesman,
Tom Woewiyu, told reporters in Abidjan on Wednesday.
   Nigerian and Ghanaian ships have carried thousands of soldiers,
tanks and other weapons to Monrovia. But since they arrived Aug. 5
they have brought only 150 tons of rice.
   More than half of Liberia's 2.3 million people have fled the
country or have been displaced from their homes.
   Officials in Sierra Leone sent a letter Tuesday to the
secretariat of the West African army and the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees saying it cannot cope with the health, security and
food problems caused by the refugee influx.
   The letter claimed the refugee population has swelled to
280,000, while U.N. and other relief agencies are providing food
for only 60,000.
   Last week, the Sierra Leone government threatened to close its
borders to Liberian refugees unless it got more international help.
   In Nigeria, Liberian refugees went on a rampage, throwing
stones, plates and food at relief officials, the Lagos newspaper
Punch reported Wednesday.
   It said the fracas Tuesday night was started by refugees
charging relief workers were not distributing food and relief
materials fairly.

   Thousands of Hindu fundamentalists failed
in a new attempt Wednesday to storm an ancient shrine claimed by
Moslems, and at least 24 more people died in violence sparked by
the dispute.
   A government minister resigned to protest Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's attempts to block construction of a Hindu temple on the
disputed site, deepening the crisis in his beleaguered coalition.
   Armed paramilitary troops blocked about 5,000 Hindus from
attempting to re-enter the mosque in Ayodhya, which has been the
center of a decades-old dispute between India's Hindu majority and
Moslem minority.
   Hindu fundamentalists broke through police cordons on Tuesday
and chipped away bricks and bits of plaster from the one-story
mosque, which they want to replace with a temple.
   At least five Hindus were killed and 20 injured when police
opened fire to throw back the rioters. At least two of the injured
died Wednesday, doctors said.
   Press Trust of India said at least 22 other people were killed
in street battles between Hindus and Moslems in four widely
separated cities.
id contributed to the
crisis.
   The Bombay-based newspaper, Free Press Journal, said: ``The
magnitude of damage that this one man has done to the country ...
cannot be assessed in terms of the number of people killed or
maimed. The poses of anguish and remorse that he now strikes are so
phony that few in this country would be taken in by them.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Georgia Used Illegal Confession To Get Death Sentence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for a Georgia death row inmate on
Wednesday accused the state of using an illegally obtained
jailhouse confession to convict his client and hiding this
information from defense lawyers.
   John Boger, arguing before the Supreme Court in behalf of Warren
McCleskey, said the state for nine years withheld from defense
lawyers a written statement from the inmate to whom McCleskey
allegedly confessed o the 1978 slaying of an Atlanta police
officer in a furniture store robbery.
   ``The reason it was held back is clear,'' Boger said. ``It was
the smoking gun.''
   But Assistant Georgia Attorney General Mary Beth Westmoreland
denied that the state withheld the statement or concealed it from
the defense. She said McCleskey's lawyers simply failed to ask for
it.
   ``The state's position is that counsel made a mistake and this
man shall die because of that mistake, is that your position?''
Justice Thurgood Marshall asked Ms. Westmoreland.
   ``Yes your honor,'' she replied, ``That is our position.''
   A federal judge last year reversed McCleskey's murder conviction
after ruling that the state had violated his constitutional rights
in obtaining the confession to inmate Offie Evans.
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the
conviction, ruling that McCleskey's lawyers had forfeited their
right to challenge the constitutionality of the confession when
they failed to raise the issue in his initial appeal in 1981.
   Boger argued Wednesday there was nothing in the written record
of the case to suggest that a statement from Evans existed.
   It was finally obtained in 1987 after a Georgia Supreme Court
ruling that police investigatory files are covered by the state's
open records law.
   That statement, he said, provided defense lawyers with their
first clue that Evans had been coached by Atlanta police detectives
before he was sent into a cell adjacent to McCleskey's to obtain
incriminating statements.
   Boger said the statement also led defense lawyers to an Atlanta
prison official who testified that he had witnessed Atlanta
detectives coaching Evans before sending him to talk with
McCleskey.
   ``We should not have our client go to the electric chair because
we could not ferret through this game of 20 questions the state was
playing here,'' he said.
   Boger said the confession was the key evidence in the state's
case against McCleskey. He said the only other evidence was the
testimony of McCleskey's co-defendant that McCleskey was the
triggerman, and the conflicting testimony of witnesses who were in
the furniture store when the police officer was killed.
   ``The key to this case was the confession that Offie Evans came
forward and said Warren McCleskey gave to him in the jail,'' Boger
said, arguing that the appeals court was ``profoundly wrong'' to
conclude that use of an illegally obtained confession was
``harmless error.''
   The appeal marked the second time the justices have reviewed
McCleskey's death sentence. In a landmark 5-4 ruling in 1987, the
court held that state death penalty laws cannot be challenged on
constitutional grounds even if statistics indicate the laws are
being applied in racially biased ways.
   McCleskey's argument in that appeal was based on an exhaustive
statistical study showing that killers of whites in Georgia draw
the death penalty far more often than do killers of blacks.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish and German negotiators agreed
Wednesday on a treaty confirming their present border on the Oder
and Neisse rivers, a pact that would end uncertainty dating to
World War II.
   The text was hammered out by working groups in the first round
of negotiations between Poland and the newly unified Germany over
their future relations, said Jerzy Sulek, chief Polish negotiator
and director of the Foreign Ministry's European department.
   Progress was also made on a second treaty on bilateral
cooperation, Sulek told the government's PAP news agency. Talks are
to continue in Bonn on Nov. 26-27.
   The border treaty still must be initialed by senior officials of
each country, signed by the heads of government, and ratified by
the respective parliaments to take effect, Sulek said.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl are scheduled to meet Nov. 8 on the Polish-German border to
discuss relations, but German and Polish officials indicated that
they did not expect the treaty to be signed at that meeting.
   The pact is only to be discussed by the two leaders, with
signing taking place in the ``nearest months,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Wladyslaw Klaczynski.
   He called it a success that the sides were able to complete the
text so quickly. The talks began Tuesday and ended Wednesday
afternoon. They were carried out by small teams of experts at a
Foreign Ministry palace in central Warsaw.
   ``Our task was to work out the fundamentals of the rules and
structures of the two treaties, and the political decision about
the date of signing of the treaty will be left to the two
governments,'' said Dieter Kastrup, of the German Foreign Ministry,
who headed Germany's delegation at the talks.
   The Oder and Neisse rivers became the border between Poland and
East Germany at the end of World War II by the decision of the
victorious Allies.
   The line allowed Poland to absorb 40,000 square miles of former
German territory. It was recognized in principle by East Germany in
1950 and by West Germany in 1970.
   The former German lands now make up about one-third of Poland.
   Poland was forced after the war to give up an even larger area
in the east to the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Former National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter testified Wednesday before the special federal grand
jury that is continuing the investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Poindexter, who is appealing his six-month sentence for lying to
Congress and obstructing lawmakers' inquiries about the sale of
U.S. arms to Iran and covert military aid to Nicaraguan rebels, was
questioned behind closed doors by prosecutors for independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   It was Poindexter's second appearance before the grand jury,
which is known to be investigating whether other former Reagan
administration officials obstructed efforts by Congress to learn
about the Iran-Contra affair.
   Poindexter, who served as President Reagan's national security
adviser from late 1985 until the Iran-Contra scandal unraveled in
late 1986, declined to comment about his testimony.
   Former White House aide Oliver L. North, whose three felony
convictions stemming from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair
were set aside in July, has testified on several occasions before
the same grand jury.
   The grand jury has not met since last summer.
   Walsh has said he will try to conclude his investigation by next
spring but his timetable may be delayed by a dispute with the Bush
administration.
   The dispute involves Walsh's request for documents from the
office of Bush when he served as vice president in the Reagan
administration, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Among other things, Walsh is seeking documents to determine what
knowledge former Bush aide Donald Gregg had of the covert
operations to arm the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to South Korea, has denied knowing
about North's involvement in the Contra resupply operation until an
Aug. 1986 meeting with Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA agent who was
a friend of Gregg.
   Before that meeting, Gregg said he had only general knowledge
that North was involved in helping private citizens give
humanitarian assistance to the rebels.
   Rodriguez told lawmakers that he sought the meeting with Gregg
and his assistant, Samuel J. Watson III, to express concerns about
corruption within the covert arms operation.
   Prosecutors are also trying to determine what knowledge, if any,
Bush may have had of the Contra resupply operation.
   A briefing memo for the vice president's May 1986 meeting with
Rodriguez mentioned that the session was being held to discuss
``resupply of the Contras.''
   Gregg told Congress that Contra resupply was not discussed
during the May 1986 meeting with Bush and said he didn't know why
the reference was included in the briefing memo.
   Gregg said he did not tell Bush about his August meeting with
Rodriguez because ``we had never discussed the Contras.''
   ``We had no responsibility for it. We had no expertise in it. I
wasn't at all certain what this amounted to,'' Gregg said.
   Gregg testified that he did not tell Bush about Rodriguez's
involvement in the covert operation until December, 1986, after
Rodriguez told him he had been recruited by North.

   Mayor Marion Barry took a new slap at the
judge who sentenced him to jail Wednesday and suggested his own
status as a recovering addict could be a benefit if he wins
election to the city council.
   ``One thing I've learned about recovering from substance abuse
is that you have to do something meaningful, something that makes
you feel good,'' Barry said during a taping of the Phil Donahue
Show. ``I'm sharper now and more prepared to do this job than I was
two or three years ago.''
   Barry, who announced near the start of his drug and perjury
trial that he would not seek a fourth term as mayor, is one of
eight candidates competing for two citywide council seats in next
Tuesday's election. He has admitted being addicted to two
prescription drugs and in recent weeks he has also acknowledged
being an ``occasional'' user of cocaine.
   In his remarks on the Donahue show, the mayor had harsh words
for U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who
sentenced Barry to six months in prison last week. On Tuesday,
Jackson himself criticized the jurors in Barry's case during a
lecture at Harvard Law School Tuesday.
   ``If I had taken from the payroll illegally then I should have
been held to that higher standard,'' Barry said, referring to a
standard that Jackson said during sentencing that the mayor had
failed to meet.
   ``I believe I should have gotten community service,'' Barry said
when asked how he felt knowing that Jackson had sentenced former
Reagan administration aide Michael Deaver to work release after
Deaver's 1988 perjury conviction. ``What we here in Washington
don't like is the unfairness.''
   A studio audience packed with Barry supporters burst into cheers
at that remark. In recent weeks, Barry has suggested that he has
been a victim of racial injustice at the hands of the judicial
system.
   Jackson, for his part, said in his law school lecture that he
was ``not happy with the way the jury addressed the case.''
   ``Some people on the jury had their own agendas. They would not
convict under any circumstances,'' the judge said at the forum.
   ``We did our duty, and that is the only comment I am willing to
make,'' juror Johnnie Mae Hardeman said Wednesday when asked about
Jackson's remarks.
   The judge hinted at his displeasure with the panel when he
discharged them at the conclusion of Barry's trial.
   ``Some of you endeavored to do your best ... and the court is
appreciative of that,'' Jackson said sternly after the jury
convicted Barry of a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge,
acquitted him of another, and deadlocked on a dozen remaining
charges.
   Barry spoke on the syndicated television show only on the
condition that the FBI videotape showing him smoking crack cocaine
on the night of his January arrest not be shown.

Ballots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Fink apparently won his bid
for re-election by a little more than 1,000 votes, but city
officials worked Wednesday to examine 3,400 challenged or absentee
ballots.
   With all precincts counted, Fink edged Democratic challenger
Rick Mystrom by 30,338 to 29,245 votes in Tuesday's runoff.
   Mystrom did not concede.
   ``The public deserves a recount if it's real close,'' he said.
``The odds are probably against us but this game is not over by any
means.''
   The city has two weeks to finish examining the challenged
ballots - those cast by voters at polling places outside their own
precincts.
   City Clerk Ruby Veldkamp said the margin was comfortable by
Anchorage election standards.
   ``We consider 100 votes a landslide,'' she said, noting that
Fink beat Mystrom by just 29 votes in the Oct. 2 three-way race
that included former state legislator H.A. ``Red'' Boucher and
forced the runoff.
   More than 48 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
   Fink's apparent victory was a turnaround for the Republican
politician who was rated negatively by 50 percent or more of
Anchorage residents, according to polls six months ago.
   ``They said Fink was out of step with the public,'' Fink said of
his adversaries on the Anchorage Assembly. ``Well, the public said,
`No, Fink's not out of step. You are.'''
   Mystrom, 46, is a former city assemblyman and former advertising
executive who led the city's unsuccessful winter Olympics bid.
   Fink, 62, is an Anchorage insurance executive whose first
mayoral term found him variously at odds with the municipal
assembly, reporters and unions representing city workers.

   The nation's ranks of active duty military men
and women declined slightly to 2,044,069 in September, the Pentagon
said Wednesday.
   The estimate, based on preliminary reports, was down just 375
from actual totals for August. However, the number, as of Sept. 30
represented a sharp decline of 86,160 from last year at the same
time.
   The Air Force suffered the deepest one-month reduction - by
1,984 to a total of 535,233. The Navy personnel number dropped by
104 to 579,781.
   Both the Army and Marine Corps gained. The Army rose 1,154 to
732,403 while the Marin Corps increased by 559 to 196,652.
   In September 1989, the Air Force had 570,880 active duty men and
women, the Army 769,741, the Navy 592,652 and the Marine Corps
196,956.
   The overall numbers do not include members of the selected
reserves called to active duty in connection with the U.S. military
buildup in the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon said.

   Two fishermen rescued after 25 days

route to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   The men, from the Caribbean island of Martinique, were found by
the crew of a sailboat about 300 miles northeast of San Juan on
Tuesday. Claude Ballu, 24, and his uncle, Irmi Ballu, 57, were
expected to arrive Thursday aboard a Coast Guard cutter.
   Claude Ballu was suffering from severe dehydration and
malnutrition. He lost nearly 55 pounds since their 25-foot vessel,
Ruth, became disabled sometime around Oct. 4. His condition is

   The elder Ballu was reported in good condition and remained on

   Martinique, a French overseas department, is located about 350
miles southeast of Puerto Rico.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierre

Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``I'm going to pick a state and get out of here. I really am,''
Rinfret said Tuesday.

   ``They promised monetary support, there's none,'' he told radio

given me no assistance whatsoever.''
   Meanwhile, Conservative gubernatorial candidate Herb London said
the GOP should be ashamed of telling voters to ``hold your nose''
and vote for Rinfret.
   ``That's very condescending to rank-and-file Republicans,''
London said Tuesday at a campaign stop in Syracuse. ``They should
be telling people to vote for the best candidate.''
   Rinfret continues to predict that he'll win Tuesday's election,
despite polls that indicate Cuomo has a substantial lead.

   Members of the Vice Lords are passing out
campaign literature for Senate candidate Paul Wellstone and Gov.
Rudy Perpich.
   ``Other than supplying some literature, we had no real
involvement in it,'' said Perpich campaign manager John Stanoch.
   The participation comes as some gang members appear to be trying
to distance themselves from traditional gang activities.
   Deputy Police Chief David Dobrotka said the Vice Lords gang has
been linked to street violence and drug trafficking.
   Gary Sudduth, vice president of the Minneapolis Urban League,
said the gang members have the right to distribute literature
because they are voters.
   ``This effort has nothing to do with the Vice Lords,'' Sudduth
said Tuesday. ``This is the first time the African-American
community has organized itself to have a massive literature drop
for two candidates that we believe are most committed to the needs
of our community.''
   Both Wellstone and Perpich are Democrats.
   The Urban League revealed the plan Tuesday on behalf of the
Minnesota African American Political Caucus, which is sponsoring
the distribution.

   Heflin, who was campaigning in another part of the state, said
he had agreed to the debate after Cabaniss pledged to run a clean

   Crews worked on the final steps of
restoring power Wednesday to Hatteras Island, cut off from the
mainland when part of its only bridge was smashed, and Army landing
craft began ferrying pedestrians.
   ``We expect to be off the generators by Thursday morning,'' said
Bob Slade, Dare County manager.
   Electric Membership Cooperative had three cables across Oregon
Inlet by Wednesday morning. They replace cables broken when a storm
drove a dredge through the bridge across the inlet last week.
   ``Today we are trying to stabilize these cables, get them in
conduit, and splice the cable that has been installed,'' Slade
said.
   The first runs of the pedestrian ferry using three landing craft
carried eight to 10 people across the inlet, Slade said. The
military craft also carried emergency supplies, fuel and Department
of Transportation equipment. Two more landing craft were being sent
in Wednesday.
   Browning Art Works at Frisco got power on a rotating basis
Wednesday. But owner Linda Browning didn't complain. She said her
shop and other long-established firms are ``going to do fine.''
   ``But those hanging by a thread and those that got a lot of tide
from the northeaster, they're coping with a lot of things all at
once,'' she said.
   Among those with problems from the storm itself is Daniel
Willis, owner of Willis Boat Landing. The storm washed seven inches
of water into his store. He said the water damage and business
losses from the bridge cut could amount to as much as $100,000.
   Getting full power back will help, Willis said.
   ``We sell LP (liquified propane) gas and our auxiliary power is
so low it doesn't have the voltage to pump LP gas,'' Willis said.
``We've got close to 100 people that need gas, and we've got a
store full of empty tanks ... but we can't do it until they restore
full power.''
   Survey teams from the state Division of Emergency Management
interviewed business operators Wednesday in preparation for the
area's application for a Small Business Administration loan.
   The work to get things back to normal with ferries replacing the
bridge has been very fast compared to the slow recovery after a
snowstorm last December, Ms. Browning said.
   ``This time, grocery stores got supplies immediately and fuel
companies are already here ... The first couple of days were real
shaky, but after that bottleneck of people trying to leave was
cleared up, they started letting supply trucks in,'' she said.
   ``My first thought was we'd be shut down for six months and the
island economy would take a fast nose dive, but it just hasn't
happened.''

<HEAD>Farm Expenses Growing Fast Because of Oil Price Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher oil prices resulting from the Mideast
crisis are driving up farm operating expenses at the fastest pace
in eight years, an Agriculture Department report said Wednesday.
   New quarterly figures through October showed farm expenses
jumped an average of 2.2 percent from July, when such figures were
last available. The expense index was up 5.6 percent from October
1989.
   ``A sharp rise in fuel prices since July contributed most to the
largest quarterly index increase since January 1982,'' the report
said.
   Meanwhile, the monthly report by the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board said that prices farmers get for raw products
declined 0.7 percent from September to October but still averaged
1.4 percent more than a year ago.
   ``Decreases in the prices of broilers, milk, corn and apples
were partially offset by higher prices for hogs, tomatoes,
strawberries and eggs,'' the board said in its preliminary report.
   Prices of most food and feed grains were down from September,
although higher prices were reported for oats, rice and durum
wheat. Soybean and sunflower prices declined, while peanut prices
increased.
   ``The October all-hog price increased moderately over September
while the all-cattle price was up slightly,'' the report said.
   Prices of steers and heifers sold as beef were at a record high
for October, the report said. But broiler prices dropped sharply
from September, partly due to large supplies and weaker seasonal
demand.
   Department economists say consumer food prices will rise an
average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year, compared with a 5.8
percent gain in 1989, the most since 1981. There has been no
official forecast for 1991.
   The net cash income of farmers in 1990 has been forecast at a
record in the range of $59 billion to $63 billion, up about 10
percent from last year. The previous high was $57.2 billion in
1988.
   Net cash income is the amount nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income in a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method of agency accounting, which includes changes
in inventories, depreciation and other allowances during the year,
1990 net farm income may be in the range of $47 billion to $52
billion, compared with $47 billion last year.
   Based on preliminary figures that could be revised next month,
the October price index for all crops was down 1.6 percent from
September and averaged 4.7 percent less than a year earlier.
   The October index for livestock and products was down 1.2
percent from September but still averaged 5.6 percent more than in
October 1989.
   Milk prices, reflecting stepped-up production, dropped 60 cents
from September to an October average of $13.60 per 100 pounds. The
October price was down $1.20 from a year earlier.
   The all-fruit price index in October was down 6.4 percent from
September and 8.7 percent the October 1989 average. Lower prices
for apples, oranges and grapefruit were mostly responsible for the
decline from September.
   The report said:
   -Cattle averaged $75.10 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up 10 cents from September. A year earlier cattle
averaged $68.70 per hundredweight. Those are averages for all types
of cattle sold as beef.
   -Hogs averaged $56.90 per hundredweight, up from $54.30 in
September and $46.60 a year earlier.
   -Corn, at $2.15 per bushel, was down from $2.32 in September and
$2.22 a year earlier.
   -Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.39 per bushel, compared with $2.46 in September and
$3.75 in October 1989.
   -Rice averaged $6.34 per 100 pounds, compared with $6.25 in
September and $7.37 a year earlier.
   -Soybeans were $5.90 per bushel, compared with $5.99 in
September and $5.54 in October 1989.
   -Upland cotton was reported at 66.9 cents per pound, compared
with 65 cents in September and 65.8 cents a year earlier.
   -Eggs were 73.5 cents per dozen, compared with 68.5 cents in
September and 71.6 cents a year earlier.
   -Milk was $13.60 per hundredweight, compared with $14.20 in
September and $14.80 in October 1989.
   -Broilers were 29 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
35.2 cents in September and 30.2 cents a year earlier.

   A mistrial was declared Wednesday during
the 14th day of jury deliberations in the trial of a sports agent
accused of hiring someone to kill a former business partner.
   Jurors reported they were deadlocked 9-3 to convict Michael
Blatt of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
   Blatt, a developer in Stockton and briefly acting general
manager of the Seattle Seahawks, was accused of hiring two former
University of the Pacific football players to kill Laurence J.
Carnegie.
   The victim was shot with an arrow from a crossbow near Stockton
on Feb. 28, 1989, then strangled. Carnegie's body was dumped in
rural Sonoma County.
   The two men Blatt was accused of hiring admitted killing
Carnegie. They were guaranteed reduced sentences for cooperating
with Blatt's prosecution.
   ``We went through a very conscientious decision process, and we
were unable to reach agreement,'' said jury foreman Bob Peppler.
   ``There's a lot of frustration on both the part of those who
think he's guilty and those who don't think he's guilty,'' Peppler
added. ``We were unable to convince each other ... so there's got
to be a lot of frustration in that.''
   Blatt's trial was in its eighth month in Oakland, where the case
was moved because of extensive publicity in Stockton.

   Iraqi officials are growing more concerned
about a possible war and are taking measures to defend the country,
Iraq's ambassador said Wednesday.
   ``We seek to avoid bloodshed ... We once more call for a
negotiated solution, to have a political and diplomatic solution,''
Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat said at a news conference.
   But Al-Mashat said the tough rhetoic of President Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III over the past few days
heightened the possibility of war.
   ``Certainly we are more concerned,'' he said. ``We are taking
precautionary measures to defend our country.''
   Should war break out, Al-Mashat said, ``This is going to be a
bloody conflict.''
   Al-Mashat's comments came the day after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein ordered military commanders to prepare for ``urban
warfare'' in Kuwait, according to the official Iraq News Agency.
   On Wednesday, Bush declared, ``I have had it,'' with the
treatment that Americans hostages are receiving in Iraq and Kuwait.
He said the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, where several diplomats have
been holed up since the Aug. 2 invasion by Kuwait, is being starved
out.
   Bush said, however, he had no timetable for any possible
military action to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Al-Mashat insisted the hostages in Iraq are being taken care of,
but he indicated Iraq will not allow supplies to be shipped to the
embassy in Kuwait City.
   ``We have said time and time again there is no reason for those
embassies to be there,'' Al-Mashat said. Only the British and the
Americans have kept their embassies open in Kuwait City.
   Al-Mashat reiterated his government's position that the Kuwait
situation is a Arab problem that ought to be decided by the United
Nations in conjunction with resolution of the Palestinian conflict.
   The purpose of Al-Mashat's news conference was to release a
document that Iraq says it seized from files at Kuwait's internal
security bureau after the invasion.
   It purports to be a memo from the director general of the state
security department to the Kuwaiti interior minister, detailing a
meeting the security chief had with CIA Director William Webster on
Nov. 14, 1989.
   Kuwaiti Brig. Fahd Ahmad Al-Fahd said he and Webster agreed on a
number of points, which he outlined in the document. The document
was written in Arabic with an unofficial translation into English.
   ``We agreed with the American side that it was important to take
advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in Iraq in order
to put pressure on that country's government to delineate our
common border,'' the document said.
   The CIA has said statements contained in the document are
fabrications, but officials said they have no doubt that Iraq
confiscated files inside Kuwait after the invasion.
   Ali Al-Sabah, a spokesman for the Kuwaiti embassy, said the
document appeared to have been altered. Nevertheless, he said
``obviously a lot of documents'' were taken by the Iraqis when they
overran the country, seizing government buildings and files.
   Al-Mashat insisted on the document's authenticity.
   ``We have physical evidence of a declaration of war by Kuwait
against Iraq,'' Al-Mashat said. ``There was a conspiracy by Kuwait
with the cooperation of the United States.''

   College Board trustees announced Wednesday the
most sweeping changes ever in the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but
rejected suggestions that charges of cultural bias prompted the
revisions.
   The new Scholastic Aptitude Test, called SAT-I, will be
introduced in the spring 1994, said College Board President Donald
M. Stewart.
   It will include less reliance on multiple choice in the math
section and more emphasis in the language section on reading
comprehension.
   The revisions, aimed in part at reducing students' reliance on
test coaches, also will allow students to use calculators on the
math section, Stewart said at the board's annual meeting.
   Critics have long charged that the SAT - the most widely used
college entrance exam - was biased, particularly against women and
minorities.
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Stewart said. ``The
SAT has been in almost continual evolution. It has never been set
in concrete. ...
   ``The new SAT will combine the high, academically demanding
standards of the current tests with revisions that increase their
educational relevance and quality for all college-bound students.''
   The old SAT had 85 verbal and 60 math questions. The SAT-I will
have 75-85 verbal and 55-60 math questions.
   The changes also include the introduction of SAT-II, an
expansion of the achievement tests currently offered with the SAT.
   SAT-II will include a written essay section, language
proficiency tests for native speakers of Japanese and Chinese, and
proficiency tests for non-native English speakers.
   Bob Schaeffer, a spokesman for the group FairTest and co-author
of the book ``Standing up to the SAT,'' said the changes fail to
solve the problem of the test's bias.
   ``The new SAT amounts to little more than rearranging the deck
chairs on an educational Titanic,'' Schaeffer said. ``The SAT
should be optional and it should be comprehensively overhauled to
address its problems.''
   FairTest and other critics have claimed that the SAT tends to
cover subjects that white male and affluent test-takers are more
likely to be familiar with.
   Oft-cited examples in the test include the question ``Dividends
are to stockholders as ...'' with the answer being ``royalties are
to writers,'' and the use of words such as ``regatta'' and ``aria''
in the vocabulary section.
   Whites as a group have outperformed minority students, and males
have fared better than females.
   In 1988, the National Organization for Women filed a lawsuit
that forced the New York State Education Department to stop using
the SAT exclusively to award merit scholarships. The department now
uses high school grades as well.
   The SAT, administered by the Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, N.J., was first given to 8,040 students in 1926. Now
about 1 million college-bound students take it annually.
   The 2{-hour exam currently consists of two multiple-choice
sections that test verbal and math skills. Each section is worth
800 points, for a perfect score of 1,600.
   Three years ago the board began field trials of possible SAT
revisions. In 1988, the board created a committee of educators to
evaluate the trials and determine what changes should be
incorporated.
   In September, board trustees voted to postpone for a month a
decision on whether to adopt the changes.
   As with the current achievement tests, the SAT-II will be an
optional accompaniment to the SAT-I.
   Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California,
Berkeley, said the addition of the Asian language achievement tests
``reflects the increasing importance of the Pacific Rim and
recognizes the increasing desire among students to study these
languages.''
   The SAT-II revisions will be phased in, beginning next year.

<HEAD>Soldier Sentenced for Palestinian Beatings</HEAD>

   An Israeli soldier was sentenced Wednesday to
two months in prison for participating in the beatings of two
Palestinian brothers, one of who later died.
   Three other soldiers were given suspended sentences by the
military court. All four - who could have faced a maximum of 20
years in prison each - were demoted in rank.
   The soldiers maintained throughout the trial they were only
following orders from top officers to beat Palestinian riot
suspects. The order has since been changed.
   Also Wednesday, a spokesman for Defense Minister Moshe Arens
said the minister proposed limiting the number of Palestinians
working in Israel. The plan would reverse Israeli policy begun in
1967, when Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Last month, Israeli authorities closed off the occupied lands
for four days following a wave of violence between Palestinians and
Jews.
   The case of the four soldiers was seen as a test of the army's
willingness to punish troops convicted of brutality in suppressing
the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   The three-judge court earlier this month found the defendants
guilty of the Feb. 7, 1988, Gaza Strip beating of brothers Khaled
and Eyad Akkal. Eyad died hours later at Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City.
   They were charged with aggravated assault because prosecutors
found no direct connection between the beating and the death.
   Israel army radio also quoted the judges as saying the
defendants ``violated basic norms of an advanced society ... (and)
operated under the distorted concept that everything is justifiable
for the sake of a military mission.''
   1st Lt. Ofer Reshef was ordered to serve two months in prison,
given a six-month suspended sentence and reduced in rank to
sergeant.
   Maj. Yitzak Levitt, 32, received a three-month suspended
sentence and was demoted him to 1st lieutenant. The panel said he
was not directly involved in the beatings, but was responsible for
them.
   Staff Sgt. Eli Shukrun and Sgt. Gad Zinbar were each given a
five-month suspended term and reduced in rank to private.
   Earlier this month, the chief army prosecutor ordered an
investigation of Col. Effie Fein, who was commander of the
soldiers' unit at the time of the beatings.
   In the early months of the uprising, officers said they were
ordered to beat people caught rioting, but not strike those in
custody. But many soldiers said the orders were not clear. The army
has since banned beatings as punishment.
   Arens's proposal to limit the Palestinian work force in Israel
was made Tuesday before Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, said spokesman Dan Naveh said. It would have to be
approved by the government.
   Meanwhile, Israel is under pressure to find jobs for tens of
thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants in a country with an
unemployment rate above 10 percent.
   ``It is now time to start changing this so Israelis will get the
opportunities in Israel and Arabs will find jobs in the (occupied)
territories,'' said Naveh.
   The four-day closure of the borders was taken after Arab-Jewish
street violence left five dead following the Oct. 8 Temple Mount
killings of 20 Palestinians. It kept about 110,000 Arabs off from
their jobs in Israel.
   A three-man commission appointed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to look into the Temple Mount shootings released its
findings Friday, stating that Palestinians had caused the violence
by throwing stones at police and that police were justified in
using gunfire because their lives were in danger.
   The report was criticized by Israeli left-wing groups and
parties as well as by Palestinians.
   Betselem, an Israeli human rights group, said Wednesday that
probe failed to seriously examine whether police were justified in
firing live ammunition. It said the commission had a ``distinct
preference for the police version over other descriptions of the
same events.''
   Also Wednesday, Arab reports said Muti Al Haj, 19, from the West
Bank village of Jalkamous, died of injuries suffered in a clash
with Israeli soldiers Sept. 10. The army was checking the report.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, masked assailants stabbed
to death Fayed Abu Irgayleh, 28, suspected of collaborating with
Israel, Arab journalists and Israel's news agency Itim said.
   At least 769 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
uprising. An additional 293 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most as suspected pro-Israeli collaborators. Fifty-one
Israelis also have died.

<HEAD>Device Capable Of Detecting Plastic Explosives Goes Into Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A device capable of detecting the kind of
plastic explosive that officials say destroyed Pan Am flight 103
went into service Wednesday at Dulles International Airport.
   James B. Busey, administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the Thermal Neutron Analysis or TNA device
represents a ``significant improvement in performance'' over
earlier generations of detection technology.
   ``The machine has the capability of detecting the explosives
that we think were present on Pan Am 103,'' the airliner destroyed
over Scotland two years ago, Busey said.
   The Dulles detector is the fourth to be installed at
international airports in an FAA program to test capabilities and
build an enhanced anti-terrorist security system at airports
worldwide.
   Other TNA units are at John F. Kennedy International Airport in
New York, the Miami international airport and Gatwick Airport near
London.
   Busey said tentative plans call for similar explosive devices to
be installed at airports in Frankfurt, Germany and at the
Baltimore-Washington airport in Maryland.
   Adaption of the TNA device, the only technology now believed
able to detect plastic explosives of the kind that brought down Pan
Am 103, coincides with a report from the National Academy of
Sciences concluding that the FAA is essentially on the right track.
   The academy concluded that a combination of the TNA automated
explosives detection system and sophisticated X-ray screening ``may
offer the optimal approach for detection of bulk explosives.''
   The TNA device installed at Dulles uses X-ray screening to
identify suspect items or areas inside specific pieces of luggage.
   The TNA machine, developed by Science Applications International
Corp. of San Diego, Calif., bombards checked luggage with
low-energy thermal neutrons and is programmed to detect
concentrations of nitrogen, an element found in explosives.
   The Dulles unit will be used to screen luggage on United
Airlines international flights. It is 40 feet wide and 20 feet
long, weighs 28,000 pounds and cost about $1 million.
   Demonstrating the device for reporters, technicians used it to
detect simulated explosives concealed in a sneaker, in a champagne
bottle and in the false bottom of a suitcase.

<TEXT>
   Mayoral candidate and convicted felon
Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci says he has learned from his mistakes.
   It remains for voters to decide whether they forgive him.
   Cianci was forced to resign as mayor in 1984 after 10 years in
office when he pleaded no contest to assaulting his estranged
wife's alleged lover. In Rhode Island, such a plea is equivalent to
a conviction.
   When he was mayor, 30 people associated with his administration
were indicted, 22 convicted.
   His restaurants are in financial trouble and he is behind on his
taxes.
   But now Cianci, an independent, is in a dead-heat mayoral race
with Democrat Andrew Annaldo and independent Frederick Lippitt.
   The current mayor, Joseph Paolino Jr., who took office after
Cianci resigned, did not run for re-election this year. Instead he
made an unsuccessful bid for governor in the Democratic primary.
   Providence ``is the only place where you could see the
re-emergence of someone like Buddy,'' said Victor Profughi, a
political science professor at Rhode Island College.
   A poll of 401 likely voters about two weeks before the Nov. 6
election showed Cianci was favored by 25 percent, Lippitt 28
percent and Annaldo 29 percent. The WJAR-TV and Alpha Research
Associates Inc. poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
points.
   The survey also found the 49-year-old Cianci had the least
favorable rating, but 50 percent of the survey's respondents liked
his experience and record.
   Annaldo, 34, is a businessman with eight years on the City
Council.
   Lippitt, 73, a Yale-educated lawyer, has racked up a long record
of public service with 22 years as a Republican state
representative and two years as Gov. Edward D. DiPrete's
administration director.
   In the late days of the campaign, issues such as improving the
city's 42 percent school drop-out rate, revitalizing neighborhoods
and fighting crime increasingly have been replaced by personal
attacks.
   At a debate Monday, Annaldo took exception to a Lippitt
commercial that compared him to an old watchdog.
   Lippitt defended it, saying Annaldo should have better
scrutinized city spending when he was with the Providence Board of
Contract and Supply.
   Cianci accused both opponents of dipping into special pensions
at taxpayers' expense. Lippitt received a $50,000 state pension in
1987 that he later said he would give to charity, while Annaldo is
enrolled in the pension plan of the city's largestmunicipal union.
   ``I'm getting caught in the crossfire here from the Little
Dipper and the Big Dipper,'' Cianci said. ``If I believe either one
of them, one is a cheat, the other is a liar, the other looks like
a dog.''
   Cianci has been campaigning on a theme that he ``never stopped
caring about Providence.''
   ``Yes, I made mistakes, but at least I admit them,'' Cianci told
elderly residents at a high-rise in the city's Italian section.
   Annaldo has promised to relieve the city's taxpayers by making
tax-exempt universities pay ``their fair share.'' That issue alone
is credited with helping him win a tough four-way Democratic
primary.
   Lippitt is calling for a city tax on meals, concerts and
sporting events.
   Cianci, who backed a mid-year tax hike in 1981, opposes new
taxes.
   Disclosures by The Providence Journal-Bulletin show that Cianci
and his businesses owe $10,000 in overdue property taxes and that
he missed the deadline for filing his state and federal tax returns
even after receiving a six-month extension.
   Still, Cianci keeps the pollsters guessing.
   ``With all the negative press about Cianci, a lot of people are
ashamed or embarrassed to tell their friends or family - never mind
a pollster - that they are going to vote for Cianci,'' said Tony
Pesaturo, president of Alpha Research. ``There's a lot of closet
support for Cianci. How large it is, we have no way of knowing.''

<TEXT>
   Harry Heath says the next time he sees his
old girlfriend, he may show her the high-school class ring of his
that she lost 22 years ago - but he probably won't let her hold it.
   A man with a metal detector found the ring this month in the
same park where it was lost in May 1968.
   ``I only had it for a few weeks when it was lost,'' Heath said
Monday. ``I was only 15 or 16. I had forgotten ompletely about
it.''
   Heath, of Annawan, said he was a sophomore when his high school
sweetheart, Sharon Hulteen, lost his ring during a prom picnic at
White Pines State Park near Dixon.
   Twenty to 30 couples scoured the park that day, and Heath
eventually forgot about the ring until John Jackowski of Freeport
found it under 2 inches of dirt.
   ``His daughter said he found things before but never had a
chance to return it,'' Heath said.
   Jackowski called Annawan High School after he found the ring on
a chance that someone there might know whose it was.
   A teacher in the office when Jackowski called knew the ``H.H.''
initial on the 1970 class ring must belong to Harry Heath, and
Heath was called.
   ``I couldn't believe it,''' said Heath. ``I thought it was a
joke.
   ``It was in good shape. To look at it, you'd never know it had
been outside.''
   Heath said he will get a kick out of showing the ring to his
former girlfriend - now married and living in Oswego - the next
time he sees her.
   ``I'll show her it, but I won't let her hold it,'' he joked. ``I
don't want to go through this again.''

<HEAD>Judge Suggests Bush Exercise Clemency For Teen-age Cocaine Pusher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager once accused of supplying cocaine
that President Bush held up during a televised speech received a
10-year sentence Wednesday from a judge who said the mandatory
penalty was too harsh.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin suggested to Keith Jackson
that he ask Bush to exercise clemency to reduce the sentence that
was mandated by Congress for defendants who sell drugs near a
schoolyard.
   ``He used you in making a big speech on the drug trade,''
Sporkin said, referring to the Sept. 5, 1989 address in which Bush
held up a bag of crack that prosecutors charge Jackson had sold to
an undercover drug agent.
   The judge called Bush ``a very decent man,'' adding that ``maybe
he can find a way to reduce some of that sentence.''
   The routine drug case of a teenager who had never before been
arrested became controversial when it was reported that White House
aides arranged for a drug sale to an undercover Drug Enforcement
Administration agent so that Bush could hold up a bag of crack as a
prop during the speech.
   In two separate trials, jurors deadlocked on charges that
Jackson, 19, sold crack cocaine to an undercover agent in Lafayette
Park near the White House just four days before Bush's address.
   But he was found guilty during the second trial of selling the
drug on two separate occasions in July 1989 to undercover agents
who met him near a high school on Capitol Hill.
   Those sales were part of the same undercover operation that led
to the charges Jackson sold drugs near the White House.
   ``I regret that the law compels me to sentence Mr. Jackson to a
mandatory 10-year term,'' Sporkin said, echoing criticism expressed
by other federal judges of the mandatory minimum sentences passed
by Congress in recent years for drug offenders.
   Critics say compulsory minimum sentences contributed to prison
overcrowding and deprive judges of power to show leniency in
appropriate cases.
   ``This is a case in which I believe that the mandatory minimum
benefits neither the defendant nor society,'' Sporkin said. ``Both
would be better served by a lower sentence that would enable this
high school senior, a first-time offender, to rehabilitate himself
and re-enter society rather than spending his youth in prison.''
   While Sporkin was required to impose the 10-year minimum, he
declined to sentence Jackson to a longer term recommended by
federal sentencing guidelines for drug distribution near schools.
   Those guidelines would have provided for a sentence between 12
years and more than 15 years.
   Sporkin noted that DEA's intentional selection of the site, near
Eastern High School on Capitol Hill, was a mitigating factor in
departing from the guidelines.
   ``Nothing in the trial testimony indicated that the defendant
would have transacted any business near Eastern High School - a
school which he did not attend - but for the suggestion of
government agents,'' Sporkin said.
   ``The purpose of the schoolyard statute is to deter drug
transactions near schools, not to encourage the government to set
up dangerous drug deals near school children,'' Sporkin said.
   But ``in this case the government has chosen repeatedly to bring
drug transactions to locations where they would not otherwise
occur.''
   Sporkin also noted Jackson's ``youth and the intense media
coverage his case has received warrant a downward departure,'' the
judge said.
   ``The defendant has already endured far greater public
humiliation than most similarly situated drug offenders,'' Sporkin
said.

   Millions of low-income Americans are getting
an increase in food stamp benefits, retroactive to Oct. 1, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Assistant Secretary Catherine Bertini said the increases include
an annual cost-of-living adjustment and a 3 percent boost in basic
benefits mandated by law.
   The food stamp program is expected to cost about $18.1 billion
in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 and serve around 20 million
people, according to department budget analysts.
   Bertini, who oversees USDA food and consumer services, said the
maximum food stamp allotment for a family of four in the 48
contiguous states and the District of Columbia was increased to
$352 a month from $331, about 6 percent.
   Income levels, which are used to determine eligibility for
households, also were increased, she said.

   Cold, wet weather spread across the Northwest on Wednesday,
while sunshine prevailed east of the Rockies.
   Showers along and behind a cold front produced rain from
Northern California and the northern Pacific Coast to the northern
Rocky Mountains.
   Heavy rain drenched coastal sections of Washington, Oregon and
Northern California during the morning and spread into the northern
Rockies.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 7 a.m. EST
included 2.07 inches at North Bend, Ore., and 1.17 inches at
Shelter Cover, Calif. Eugene, Ore., got 2.75 inches of rain
Tuesday, a record for the date.
   Six to 12 inches of snow was possible during the night in the
mountains and passes of northwestern Montana, the National Weather
Service said.
   A winter storm watch in effect into early Thursday was posted
for the mountains of northern Utah, and a winter storm watch was
posted for Thursday for the mountains of southern Utah.
   Midday temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s behind the cold
front.
   The sky was mostly clear east of the Rockies and strong
southerly wind blew from the southern Plains region to the upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Kansas City, Mo., warmed to a record 79.
   Morning lows only in the 30s were reported over parts of the
Great Basin, which includes most of Nevada and western Utah, and
the Rockies.
   Morning lows were in 30s and 40s across much of the Southeast,
except for Florida where Miami had a low of 75, and across the

   Unless the 1991 rainy season is wetter
than last winter, water supplied to California farmers for
irrigation could be reduced by half to two-thirds, state and
federal officials say.
   Urban water users who rely on state reservoirs could suffer cuts
of 13 percent if the drought runs into a fifth year, officials
said. Federal deliveries to municipal customers could drop 25
percent to 50 percent.
   In an annual drought-outlook conference titled ``What if ...
1991 is Dry?'' state, federal and local officials said Tuesday that
another critically dry winter could be catastrophic for many
sectors of California's economy and the environment.
   ``I hope we don't have to experience the `what if' situation,''
said Chet Bowling, drought coordinator for the federal Central
Valley Project, the largest water supplier in California.
   A draft report released Tuesday by the state Department of Water
Resources said a fifth drought year would leave California as bad
off as it was in 1977, the driest year on record.
   This year, the State Water Project and the Central Valley
Project cut farm deliveries by 50 percent, and the CVP cut
municipal supplies by 25 percent to 50 percent, depending on each
city's contract. It was only the second time in the history of both
projects that deliveries were disrupted - the first time was 1977.
   Agriculture suffered an estimated $480 million in
drought-related losses in 1990.
   If the drought continues, the State Water Project estimates
reductions to agriculture of 63 percent, while the federal project
cuts would be about 50 percent.
   The state report said San Francisco and some other Bay area
cities could be forced to cut water use by half. Some cities in
southern California already are curtailing some water uses.
   Most of California's available water - 82 percent, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey - is used for irrigating crops.
California leads the nation in water use, at 30.3 billion gallons a
day.
   Agriculture accounts for more than $16 billion of the state's
$300-billion- plus annual economy.
   While the drought that began in 1986 is less severe than
1976-77, the state report said it poses an unprecedented threat to
fish and wildlife.
   ``California's population of 30 million people and their needs
for water and space has combined with the drought to create what is
truly a natural disaster,'' the report said.
   Although water authorities acknowledge that it is too early to
forecast what kind of winter California will have - most of the
state's rainfall is recorded in December, January and February -
the report said there were some disturbing historical trends.
   ``Looking back in history, dry years and wet years seem to
cluster slightly more than would be expected by chance. But no one
so far has been able to develop a predictive model for California
for next year from these irregular patterns.''
   Storage in California's major reservoirs as of Oct. 1 was about
60 percent of average.

<TEXT>
   Banking regulators moved Wednesday toward
greatly expanding the requirement that independent appraisers
assess the value of many homes before buyers receive mortgages.
   The Federal Reserve Board, by a 5-1 vote, offered for public
comment a rule change that would require appraisals on all real
estate-based loans of $50,000 or more. The current rule, adopted in
June, set a $100,000 cut off.
   But members of Congress, led by Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga.,
complained that the higher limit excluded too many home sales and
that regulators were ignoring legislators' intent in the appraisal
reforms included in last year's savings and loan law.
   Acording to the National Association of Realtors, 53.5 percent
of home sales in September would have required appraisals under a
$100,000 cut off, while 84.5 percent would need an appraisal under
the $50,000 limit.
   Barnard, who sponsored the appraisal reforms, argued in a letter
to the Federal Reserve that faulty appraisals were one of the chief
factors contributing to the S&amp;L crisis. S&amp;Ls lost huge sums on
loans secured by property worth much less than appraisals
indicated.
   The 1989 S&amp;L law, starting in July 1991, requires banks, S&amp;Ls
and credit unions with federally insured deposits to use
state-licensed appraisers before making real estate-based loans.
   Federal Reserve Board member Martha R. Seger, who voted against
considering a lower cut off, argued that most S&amp;L problems were
found in commercial real estate loans well over $100,000, not in
the single-family home loans which would be affected by a lower cut
off.
   ``This is an anti-consumer piece of legislation when you get
right down to it because the cost of these appraisals will be borne
by the consumer, the person who wants to buy the existing home,''
she said.
   Board member Wayne D. Angell voted in favor of seeking comment
on changing the rule, but he said he would probably vote against
the change.
   However, the other four board members said they were concerned
that a $100,000 cut off would be out of line with Congress' intent
in last year's law. And, they said the Fed's rule should be
consistent with other agencies' standards.
   Other financial institution regulators already have adopted the
$50,000 cut off. They are the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.

   President Hosni Mubarak warned Wednesday
that the Persian Gulf crisis ``could explode at any time.''
   Mubarak urged ``our Iraqi brothers'' to realize the danger in
which they have placed the Middle East.
   ``We should not take lightly the force stationed there because
it's very powerful,'' Mubarak said of the multinational force in
the gulf. If war comes, ``Iraq will be ruined, and (it) will harm
all of us.''
   ``I hope our brothers in Iraq will understand well that the
situation is very dangerous and could explode at any time,'' the
Egyptian leader told reporters.
   About 310,000 troops from 13 nations are stationed in Saudi
Arabia and on warships in the gulf region to force Iraq out of
Kuwait, which Baghdad invaded Aug. 2 in a dispute over land, oil
and money.
   Egypt has contributed 16,000 troops - the largest of the Arab
contingents. Arab troops form the first line of defense against
Iraq and are positioned in Saudi Arabia, just across the border
with Kuwait.
   Baghdad has 460,000 troops in southern Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Mubarak's warning came a day after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein reportedly told his military commanders the United States
might attack Iraq within days and to prepare for battle.
   Asked about a proposal by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
that leaders of Arab nations meet to solve the gulf crisis, Mubarak
noted that previous Arab summits had not been successful.
   ``Arab countries held a summit meeting on Aug. 10 and did not
achieve anything. Arab countries have tried and are still trying to
get a peaceful solution,'' Mubarak said.
   The Soviet leader made the proposal in France on Monday.

<HEAD>Irish Prime Minister Wins Vote of Confidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey won a vote
of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday after bowing to pressure
and dismissing a top aide.
   The aide, Brian Lenihan, is running for president, but his
campaign has suffered because of a scandal arising from reports
that Lenihan lied about his role in a political crisis eight years.
   ``What I have to do, I do with great sadness and great sorrow,''
said Haughey. After he stripped Lenihan of his titles of deputy
prime minister and defense minister, Parliament gave Haughey's
government an 83-80 vote of confidence.
   Haughey's Fianna Fail party has 77 seats in the 165-seat
Parliament and governs with the support of the Progressive
Democrats, who hold six seats. The Progressive Democrats reportedly
had insisted Lenihan leave the government.
   The main opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Labor Party,
voted against the confidence motion. Two opposition lawmakers did
not vote.
   In an act of political loyalty, Lenihan and his sister,
Education Minister Mary O'Rourke, who are also members of
Parliament, both voted to support Haughey despite his dismissal of
Lenihan.
   Labor Party leader Dick Spring had earlier called Haughey a liar
and Lenihan ``an Irish version of Richard Nixon.''
   ``This is a debate about greed for office, disregard for truth
and about contempt for political standards,'' Spring said
Wednesday.
   The controversy stems from events that occurred in 1982, after
the Fine Gael-led government of Garret FitzGerald lost a confidence
vote.
   Haughey, Lenihan and other leaders of the Fianna Fail party were
accused at the time of trying to persuade then-President Patrick
Hillery to call them to head a government without holding a
national election, which would have been illegal.
   Haughey and Lenihan had always denied the charge, but last week
a political science graduate student produced a tape recording of
an interview in which Lenihan gave a detailed account of
telephoning Hillery.
   Lenihan has insisted he never phoned Hillery. But his
conflicting accounts of the event elevated an arcane political
issue into a question of his truthfulness.
   Lenihan, the early frontrunner for next Wednesday's presidential
election, has fallen far behind Mary Robinson, the candidate backed
by Labor.
   A poll published Wednesday by the Irish Independent newspaper
showed Mrs. Robinson favored by 52 percent, Lenihan by 31 percent
and Fine Gael's Austin Currie with 17 percent.
   Haughey said he continued to support Lenihan for president of
this nation of 3.7 million people.
   ``Brian Lenihan has been a friend, a loyal and trusted colleague
with whom I have served for well over a quarter of a century. He
has done great service to the Irish people,'' Haughey said.
   Haughey, 65, and Lenihan, 59, are allies from the days they were
Cabinet members in the 1970s under Prime Minister Sean LeMass,
Haughey's father-in-law.

<HEAD>Former Dissident Elected Mayor of Budapest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gabor Demszky, a former dissident and
leading member of the parliamentary opposition, was elected mayor
of Budapest on Wednesday, the official MTI news agency reported.
   His appointment had been expected after municipal elections in
which the center-right coalition parties governing nationally fared
poorly. Opposition liberal parties made strong gains, particularly
in urban centers.
   Demszky is a leading official in the largest opposition party,
the League of Free Democrats.
   Under the former Communist leadership, Demszky was one of the
country's leading dissidents who was often detained for his
anti-Communist activities.
   Demszky was elected mayor by the new Municipal Assembly. Under
Hungary's complex electoral procedures, the assembly is elected in
direct balloting and it, in turn, elects the mayor.
   The 38-year-old lawyer was the only candidate for the post, MTI
reported.
   The position is one of the most important in the country. About
one-fifth of Hungary's 10.5 million people live in the capital, and
the job of mayor was expected to be complicated by a sense of
restiveness in Budapest following an unprecedented show of defiance
against the newly elected national government.
   It was forced to reduce a 70 percent gasoline price increase
after taxi and truck drivers brought traffic to a standstill in the
capital and elsewhere with a three-day blockade last week.
   President Arpad Goencz, a founding member of the Free Democrats
who gave up his political affiliation upon his appointment as head
of state, said the country's affairs would have to be handled
differently afer the recent unrest.
   Goencz told MTI it was also likely to affect the capital and the
new municipal leadership would face a wide range of difficulties.

<TEXT>
   The interior minister indicated
Wednesday the government might be ready to hear the demands of the
Medellin cocaine cartel in hopes of freeing seven kidnapped
journalists.
   Julio Cesar Sanchez said his government is prepared to ``listen
to the complaints even of those who find themselves outside the
law.''
   The interior minister's statement, aired over the RCN radio
network, could signal a reversal in the government policy of not
negotiating with drug traffickers.
   His comments came in response to a question about seven
journalists kidnapped by the Medellin cartel the past two months,
including Francisco Santos, editor of the country's leading
newspaper, El Tiempo, and Diana Turbay, daughter of former
president Julio Cesar Turbay.
   In a speech Wednesday, President Cesar Gaviria did not refer to
his minister's comments, saying only that Colombia would ``meet its
international obligations'' concerning narcotics.
   However, the president did not publicly reject last week's
proposal by a representative of the drug traffickers to seek United
Nations' mediation in their conflict with the government.
   The cartel issued a statement Tuesday saying it kidnapped the
journalists and Marina Montoya, the sister of Colombia's ambassador
to Canada. It threatened to kill its hostages if the government
launches a new offensive against drug traffickers.
   In his radio interview, Sanchez said the cartel may have some
legitimate complaints.
   He added: ``The goverment is ready to hear the legitimate
complaints of any citizen. The reason for being a democratic
government is that even those at the margin of the law can demand
guarantees.''
   In a statement to local media, the cartel said it had learned of
a government plot to kidnap the relative of a drug baron and
exchange him for the journalists.
   ``If something of this nature happens, our response will be
immediate and we will execute the detained journalists,'' the
statement said.
   Sanchez responded: ``using threats to ask for justice is not
appropriate.''
   Judicial Police Chief Col. Oscar Pelaez said security forces
never planned to kidnap anyone, but rather only intend to ``capture
criminals.''
   The Medellin gang has been blamed for killing about 550
Colombians since the government and drug traffickers began battling
each other in August 1989.
   A group of political and church leaders have offered to try to
mediate between the government and the cartel. They were responding
to a request by drug traffickers, presented last week by lawyer
Guido Parra, to find a negotiated solution to the conflict.
   Parra's proposal included seeking mediation by the United
Nations.
   Colombia's Cali and Medellin drug cartels supply most of the
cocaine consumed in the United States and Europe.

   The Court of Appeals also ruled that Faoud Ali Saleh, 31, will

early December, when analysts meet in New York.

<HEAD>Woman Sues Over Retracted $10 Million Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAWKAWLIN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who won $10 million in a contest
sponsored by McDonald's and NBC but lost it because her daughter
works for the fast-food chain has sued to regain her prize.
   Charles and Thelma Bellows filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Bay County
Circuit Court seeking the $10 million prize plus damages and legal
fees.
   ``From 10:30 a.m. to 8 o'clock at night we were millionaires. It
was so fast it was hard to believe,'' Charles Bellows said.
   The lawsuit names McDonald's Corp., NBC Inc., the McDonald's
franchise where they bought the ticket and a company that judged
the contest.
   The Bellows say they should be allowed to keep the prize because
their married daughter is not a member of their immediate family.
   Mrs. Bellows, 49, was named on national TV Oct. 12 as the winner
in the ``McMillions on NBC'' contest.
   She received the winning ticket the day before when she bought a
meal at a McDonald's restaurant in Auburn where one of her six
children, Charlene Saunders, works.
   The couple spent a day in Detroit with representatives from
McDonald's, taping a commercial. They planned to buy a new house
and furniture, and take a trip to the Caribbean.
   
   By evening, the dream fizzled. McDonald's told her she was
ineligible.
   ``I think the worst part is knowing that they fully understood
our daughter worked there, let Thelma go on TV and still declared
her the winner,'' said Bellows, co-owner of a Sanford construction
company.
   But McDonald's spokesman Charles Rubner said the company had
been unaware of the relationship. He said the company was obligated
to declare Mrs. Bellows ineligible.
   ``People trust McDonald's,'' Rubner said. ``We want them to
continue to trust us.''
   The Bellows' attorney, Ramon Rolf Jr., said the case is similar
t one in Utah in which a man was disqualified for a prize because
his son worked for the newspaper sponsoring the contest.
   The Utah Supreme Court ruled the married son, who was
financially independent, wasn't part of his father's immediate
family. The man got his prize, a Plymouth sedan, Rolf said.
   ``This case is real similar,'' he said.

   Seth Morgan, a transient ex-convict who wrote
an acclaimed novel, was drunk and on drugs when he and a companion
died in a motorcycle accident two weeks ago, according to police.
   Morgan told an interviewer several months before that being in
New Orleans helped him kick an alcohol-drug addiction and write
``Homeboy,'' a novel that won critical acclaim when it was
published last spring.
   But tests by the Orleans Parish coroner's office showed a 0.3
percent alcohol level in Morgan's blood, police said Monday.
Intoxication in Louisiana is defined as 0.1 percent.
   The tests also showed the presence of cocaine and Demerol in
Morgan's body, police said.
   Morgan's passenger, Diane Suzy Skidmore Levine, 37, had a
blood-alcohol level of 0.28 percent, the coroner's office said.
   Morgan and Levine were killed Oct. 17 when Morgan's motorcycle
hit a bridge piling. Police said Morgan, 41, had been arrested a
day before his death for drunken driving.
   Morgan, plagued much of his life by addictions to alcohol and
drugs, came to New Orleans four years ago. He had begun writing
while serving three years in California for robbery.
   New Orleans was ``where I regained sobriety, sanity,'' he said.

<HEAD>GOP Fund-Raising Lagging Compared to Past Campaigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Republican campaign committees have
suffered multimillion-dollar drops in receipts and spending
compared to the last non-presidential election campaign, a federal
agency said Wednesday.
   The GOP committees still have spent far more this time around
than their Democratic counterparts, which did not experience a
decline in campaign fund-rasising, the Federal Election Commission
said.
   As of Oct. 17, the FEC said, the Republican national, senatorial
and congressional committees had received $30 million less and
spent $26 million less than in the same period during the 1985-86
cycle.
   At the same time, the level of financial activity at the
Democratic committees remained on a par with the previous off-year
campaign cycle.
   Republican Party strategists have said GOP fund-raising efforts
were hurt by President Bush's change of heart on taxes. Bush
abandoned his no-new-taxes campaign pledge this fall and agreed to
a package of spending cuts and new taxes to help reduce the federal
deficit.
   Nevertheless, the GOP managed to outspend the Democrats this
year by more than $118 million, according to the FEC.
   The three GOP committees raised and spent $159 million from Jan.
1, 1989, to Oct. 17, 1990. The three Democratic committees raised
$37 million and spent $40 million in the same period.
   The Republicans contributed nearly twice as much as the
Democrats directly to candidates - $1.8 million compared to just
over $900,000, the FEC said. Coordinated expenditures, or indirect
aid to candidates, came to $7.4 million for the GOP and $5.8
million for the Democrats.
   The GOP also has transferred much more money to state party
committees than the Democrats - $3.7 million compared to $1.6
million.
   In addition, the national Republican Party operates two joint
fund-raising committees that have distributed $1.9 million to 49
Senate candidates, the FEC said. Democrats have filed a complaint
alleging that the committees - the Republican Senatorial Inner
Circle 1990 and 1990-91 - are illegally circumventing campaign
spending limits.

   A policeman's plan to have a teen-age
informant kill his wife failed when the gunman decided to back out
of the deal, authorities said.
   Duncannon Police Officer David Paul Wagner, 31, bribed Ramon Lee
Rousch, 19, of Dauphin, to kill his wife in exchange for
negotiating a deal on the teen-ager's burglary conviction, police
said Tuesday.
   A police affidavit said Wagner showed Rousch the layout of his
home, gave him the keys and waited at a shopping mall for Rousch to
finish the job.
   Rouch was supposed to enter the Shamokin Dam home, find a weapon
in the Wagners' bedroom and shoot Wagner's wife, Lori, when she got
home.
   Rousch held Mrs. Wagner at gunpoint for nearly two hours on
Sept. 5, but ``he chickened out'' of killing her, said Shamokin Dam
Police Chief Robert Lockcuff.
   Shamokin Dam lies on the Susquehanna River, about 60 miles north
of Harrisburg in central Pennsylvania.
   When Rousch was arrested, he gave police a taped confession
outlining the plot, Lockcuff said.
   ``There have been some marital problems,'' Lockcuff said of the
Wagners. ``Your basic falling out of love type thing.''
   Wagner, who was off-duty, was arrested at the Duncannon police
station Monday, Lockcuff said.
   Wagner was charged with criminal attempt at murder, criminal
solicitation to commit murder and criminal conspiracy to commit
murder, said District Justice Willis Savidge. He was being held in
jail in lieu of $175,000 bail.
   Rousch was charged with robbery, burglary, recklessly
endangering another person, firearm violations and theft. He was
being held in the same jail in lieu of $25,000 bail.
   Lockcuff said police were investigating two other alleged
attempts on Mrs. Wagner's life. He would not give details of the
investigations.
   Wagner had been a police officer in Shamokin Dam before joining
the police force in Duncannon, a town about 40 miles to the south,
Lockcuff said.
   ``He was a good officer,'' he said. ``We never had any problems
with him.''

   A jury on Wednesday decided that prizefighter
Mike Tyson fondled a woman at a dance club in 1988 and awarded the
woman $100 in compensatory damages.
   The five-women, one-man jury was scheduled to return to federal
court Thursday to hear testimony on Tyson's financial status before
ruling on punitive damages.
   The woman, Sandra Miller, asked for up to $2.5 million in
punitive damages in her civil lawsuit.
   The jury deliberated about 4{ hours before finding that Tyson,
the former heavyweight champion, grabbed Miller's breasts and
buttocks after she refused his advances at Bentley's Disco on Dec.
10, 1988.
   Tyson, who had denied that the incident ever took place, showed
no outward emotion as U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey read
the verdict, which found the fighter had committed battery but not
assault.
   Tyson said he was satisfied with the verdict. ``If they thought
it was serious, they would have given her more than 100 bucks,'' he
said.
   When asked how she felt, Miller, a 26-year-old computer
operator, said, ``Great that they know that he did it.''
   In closing arguments earlier Wednesday, Tyson's attorney, Robert
Hirth, told the jury Miller had concocted the allegations to obtain
money from Tyson.
   ``You should send a message that if Sandra Miller wants to
engage in a get-rich-quick scheme she should buy a lottery
ticket,'' Hirth told jurors.
   U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey instructed the jury to
decide separately whether Tyson committed assault or battery.
   He said assault did not require a finding of contact but could
include ``an overt menacing act.'' A finding of battery requires
actual contact, he said.
   The trial was in federal court because Tyson lives out of state.

   Police drove 14,000 displaced people out
of a shantytown and burned their makeshift hovels to ensure they do
not return, witnesses said Wednesday.
   The displaced people, who fled war and famine in southern Sudan,
have been moved to a camp in Jabal Awlia, about 25 miles south of
Khartoum. Their movements can be controlled more easily there,
because they have to pass checkpoints to go to the capital.
   Although the government says 80 percent of the facilities in the
new camp are finished, witnesses say it has no water. And those now
living in the area are not happy to have the southerners come in.
   The government announced last year it would dismantle
shantytowns around Khartoum where an estimated 2 million displaced
southern and western Sudanese have been living. A 1984-85 drought
in the western Sudan brought many refugees to Khartoum.
   Because of the war, the southerners are not welcomed by the
northerners. The government has accused the war refugees of
straining the capital's limited resources and increasing the crime
rate.
   Rebels in the south claim that the Christian and animist
residents of the region are persecuted by the central government of
the north, where the population is Moslem. War has been raging in
the south for seven years.
   When the military government decided to dismantle the camps last
year, the three southerners on the ruling 15-man revolutionary
command council protested. It was unclear why the government
decided to enforce the decision now.
   Witnesses said the evacuation of the Bentiu camp started
Saturday evening and ended Tuesday. They said smoke could still be
seen Wednesday coming out of the camp that police burned down after
the evacuation.
   There were no reports of violence being employed to empty the
camp.
   The Bentiu camp, named after a town in the Upper Nile region
where most of the inhabitants fled from, was made up of makeshift
huts made of wood sticks, tin and orange plastic sheets. It was
better know as Hilat al Shook, or village of the thorns, because it
was full of thorn trees.
   The government has been having problems carrying out its
evacuation of another shantytown called Takamul. The inhabitants
there have built mud huts and are refusing to move.

<HEAD>Duke Says He's `Inclined' to Run for Governor in '92</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana legislator David Duke said Wednesday
that he's ``inclined'' to run for governor in 1992.
   Duke, a Republican state representative and former Ku Klux Klan
leader, ran an unsuccessful but stronger-than-expected race for the
U.S. Senate this fall.
   Duke's comments came as part of a heated discussion on Jesse
Jackson's syndicated television program, which is scheduled to be
broadcast over the weekend.
   When Jackson asked Duke if he was inclined to run for governor
of Louisiana in 1992, he replied: ``I am inclined.''
   Duke supporters cheered his responses, but often jeered at
comments from others in the audience and on the panel of which Duke
was a member.
   Duke's sharpest exchanges were with Gloria Allred, a women's
rights lawyer who shook her finger at him and described his remarks
about reverse discrimination as ``garbage.''
   ``You give women's rights a bad name,'' Duke shot back, amid
cries of ``witch'' from his supporters.
   Jackson urged both panelists to ``calm down.''
   The overflow crowd of about 200 included supporters of both
sides, ranging from members of the conservative Young Americans for
Freedom to representatives of the liberal American Civil Liberties
Union.
   When a black man in the audience came forward with what he said
were photographs of Duke in Nazi and Klan uniforms, Duke said:
   ``I am sorry to say that I participated in these organizations.
I have certainly grown up in my life, and we all have the right to
do that.''
   Much of the program focused on the civil rights bill recently
vetoed by President Bush.
   ``This bill is about racial discrimination,'' Duke said. ``We
have got massive racial discrimination going on right now in
America, but now it's against whites.''
   Some booed that remark.
   Duke's legislative assistant, Glenn Montecino, said Duke
originally accepted an invitation to appear on the show with the
understanding it would be a one-on-one discussion with Jackson.
   Duke withdrew after being told he would be on a panel with
several black activists, but agreed to appear when the panel was
revised.
   Also on the panel were Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., and Richard
Viguerie, a conservative fund-raiser.
   Duke, Viguerie and Ms. Allred are white; Jackson and Mfume are

   The Air Force on Wednesday delayed
Atlantis' classified flight next week because of problems with a
spy satellite aboard the shuttle.
   ``Details are classified, and it is too early to predict a new
launch date,'' the Air Force said in a two-sentence statement.
   The Air Force described the problem as ``anomalies discovered
during cargo testing.'' Capt. Marty Hauser, a Pentagon spokesman in
Washington, refused to say when the problem was detected and
declined to discuss the flight further.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the
satellite was to spy on Iraq.
   Top NASA managers on Tuesday scheduled Atlantis' launch for Nov.
9. The shuttle was cleared for flight following a fueling test last
week that found it free of dangerous hydrogen leaks.
   A fueling test on Tuesday cleared the shuttle Columbia for a
December astronomy mission. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said it
was too soon to know whether that mission would be affected by
Atlantis' delay.
   ``We don't know how to set dates or how to plan'' because the
extent of the problem the satellite aboard Atlantis is unknown, she
said.
   Sources estimated the delay would be one to two weeks.
   It is the seventh shuttle flight dedicated entirely to the
Defense Department. Two more Defense Department missions are
planned, both next year, but their cargoes are unclassified.
   ``The bottom line is it's no longer affordable'' to maintain
secure operations for a mission, said a Pentagon official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The delay was disappointing news for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, which had been hoping to close the year
with six shuttle flights. NASA had planned for nine missions this
year, but was plagued by hydrogen leaks on Columbia and then on
Atlantis.
   Columbia's leaks were detected in May during fueling for the
astronomy mission's first launch attempt. Three more tries followed
before NASA stopped to send up Discovery with a sun-exploring
satellite earlier this month.
   Atlantis was grounded in June when hydrogen escaped during a
fueling test.

<HEAD>U.S. Backs Resolution to Set Up Escrow Accounts for Iraqi Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council's next move against
Baghdad is a resolution that would put Iraq's frozen assets into an
escrow account to pay for war damages, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R.
Pickering said Wednesday.
   Pickering told reporters the resolution would allow Iraqi funds
and property frozen for the duration of the crisis to be put into a
``compensation account.''
   The assets from each country's escrow account would not be
divided until the crisis has run its course, because there is no
way of assessing total costs until then.
   On Monday, the Security Council voted to hold Iraq liable for
human rights abuses and war damages during its occupation of
Kuwait. But that resolution did not contain a means of distributing
Iraqi funds. The new resolution apparently would provide such a
mechanism.
   Pickering said the council could begin deliberating the measure
later this week or early next week.
   He becomes president of the council for the month of November,
with powers to sway the pace of negotiations and help set the
body's priorities.
   Pickering alluded to the escrow account plan Monday, when he
told the Security Council that Iraq would be liable for full
compensation for the losses and damages it has caused by its
illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
   Iraq has about $4 billion in overseas assets, of which about
$800 million are in America. That money could be used to help
rebuild Kuwait if its government is restored after an Iraqi
withdrawal.
   Other countries are suffering billions of dollars in losses in
indirect economic losses due to higher oil prices, loss of trade,
and loss of remittances from foreign workers who had been in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Jordan alone figures it will lose about $2 billion; Poland
estimates similar losses.

   A woman's recollection of watching
her father molest and kill a playmate with a rock 21 years ago is
full of inconsistencies, his lawyer said Wednesday at the start of
his murder trial.
   A prosecutor promised during her opening statement to provide
evidence that George Franklin Sr. asked his wife to wash a
bloodstained shirt a few days after the slaying.
   Franklin's daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, told police she
saw her father use a rock to kill 8-year-old Susan Nason on Sept.
22, 1969. She said she repressed memories of the slaying until last
year, when they flooded back as she looked at her own young
daughter.
   Douglas Horngrad, one of Franklin's lawyers, said
Franklin-Lipsker's memories are faulty.
   ``The truth is that Mrs. Lipsker tells different versions of
different stories to different people at different times,'' he
said.
   Horngrad told a San Mateo County Superior Court jury there is no
evidence linking Franklin to the girl's slaying. Defense attorneys
have suggested police overlooked other possible suspects in the
investigation more than two decades ago.
   Franklin, 51, a former San Mateo firefighter, faces a possible
life sentence if convicted.
   ``The (last) touch that Susie felt was not one of love. ... It
was a touch of lust and perversion,'' prosecutor Elaine Tipton
said.
   Franklin-Lipsker has said her father threatened to kill her if
she told anyone what she had seen. She has said she saw her father
sexually attacking her friend, then moving toward the girl with a
rock raised over his head.
   The girl's body was discovered three months later in a ravine
off a highway. A blood-stained rock was lying neaby, authorities
said.
   ``For 20 years this crime remained unsolved,'' Tipton said.
``The terrible event remained deep in the mind of Eileen Franklin.
For 20 years, the defendant lived his life pretending to know
nothing of the disappearance and death of this young child.''
   The Franklin family lived down the street from the Nasons in
Foster City, south of San Francisco, when the child was slain.
   Horngrad said Franklin-Lipsker initially told her brother and
mother her memory returned during a hypnotic trance. Later, she
said she had lied because she thought the story was more believable
than the truth, Horngrad said.
   Horngrad suggested the real reason she had changed her story was
that her mother, a lawyer, told her hypnotically-induced evidence
is inadmissible in California courts.
   Franklin-Lipsker also has changed details of her story, such as
whether her sister was with her when the slaying occurred, the time
of day it occurred, the setting and where she was when she first
remembered the incident, Horngrad said.
   Franklin-Lipsker was expected to testify next week. Her sister,
Janice Franklin, who testified during a preliminary hearing in May
that she and Eileen were molested by Franklin when they were
children, was also scheduled to testify.

<TEXT>
   Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday
rejected the Paraguayan government's request to extradite the son
of deposed dictator Alfredo Stroessner.
   All 10 justices on the court voted against the extradition of
Gustavo Stroessner, held under preventative detention since August,
court spokesman Celso Mello said.
   Stroessner, 46, an ex-colonel in the Paraguayan Air Force, had
been accused by Paraguay's new government of corruption and misuse
of public funds.
   Mello said documents presented by Paraguayan authorities did not
indicate places or dates of the alleged crimes, and gave no
guarantee that Stroessner would face only the charges listed in the
extradition request.
   Stroessner fled to Brazil in February 1989 after a military coup
ousted his father, who had ruled Paraguay since 1954.

<HEAD>Accused Terrorist Turned Over to Israel</HEAD>

   Mahmoud Atta, wanted in Israel on terrorism
charges, has been turned over to Israeli authorities, the State
Department said Wednesday night.
   Atta, who also uses the name Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad, was placed
in Israeli custody ``last evening'' and immediately taken out of
the United States, said spokesman Adam Shub.
   Last Friday, the imminence of the transfer and threats from a
terrorist group to act if it were carried out prompted the
department to issue an unusual alert that terrorists might be
planning an attack on passenger ships in the eastern Mediterranean
Sea.
   The department said then it had ``specific and credible''
information about such an attack that ``may be undertaken at any
time.''
   Wednesday evening, Shub said he had nothing to add to the alert.
   Atta, 37 and a U.S. citizen, has been accused of taking part in
the 1986 machine gun attack on a bus carrying Jewish settlers in
the occupied West Bank. The driver was killed and a passenger
wounded.
   He was arrested in the United States three years ago. On Aug.
31, the Supreme Court rejected his last appeal in a court battle to
avoid extradition.
   The Abu Nidal Organization, a terrorist group of which Atta was
a member, has threatened ``to attack U.S. interests'' if Atta were
extradited, the department said.
   The Abu Nidal Organization is believed responsible for some of
the bloodiest terrorist attacks in recent years.
   It was another group, however, led by Abu Abbas that hijacked
the Italian cruise liner in Egypt in 1985. One of the hijackers
shot and killed a wheelchair-using American, Leon Klinghoffer, in
that two-day episode.

<TEXT>
   The Russian parliament voted Wednesday to start a
500-day transition to a market economy on Thursday, putting it on a
collision course with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the
national legislature.
   Gorbachev and the Supreme Soviet legislature agreed Oct. 19 on a
compromise economic rescue plan that is slower and less radical
than the 500-day plan.
   Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, has declared
sovereignty from the central Soviet government. It claims the right
to put its own economic reform plan into effect on its territory,
which covers two-thirds of the Soviet land mass.
   It is unclear who will be obeyed if the Russian government, led
by Gorbachev's leading political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, gives
economic orders that contradict the national government.
   Already, the central government has warned bank officials they
will be fired if they carry out a new Russian republic law creating
independent banks, according to Deputy Russian Premier Gennady
Filshin.
   The Russian parliament also challenged the Kremlin by claiming
control over the republic's natural reso for the
newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda.
   ``I spent the whole day here asking people what concrete steps
they planned to take, and no one could give me an answer,'' he
added, gesturing from a balcony overlooking the parliament's marble
meeting hall.
   Grigori Yavlinsky, a deputy prime minister of the Russian
republic and one of the authors of the 500-day plan, told reporters
the parliament should set up a committee of economic advisers to
suggest specific measures.
   But Yavlinsky expressed doubt that Russia would be able to put
the 500-day plan into effect, at least in its original form.
   ``Maybe in August we could have done it, but it's too late
now,'' he said, noting that the national parliament has adopted the
compromise plan and the country's economy has worsened.
   Figures released Wednesday by the Russian republic's committee
on statistics show that production of consumer goods rose 5.8
percent in the first nine months of 1990, but demand rose even
faster, creating chronic shortages.
   The committee said rationing of food and consumer goods is
widespread, and prices are rising. It also said industrial output
dropped 2.5 percent, housing construction is down, and Russia's
exports to foreign countries declined 7 percent.
   The 500-day plan contains a detailed timetable for scrapping the
70-year-old central planning system, under which Moscow bureaucrats
have told thousands of factories, farms and small businesses what
to produce and how much to charge.
   The plan calls for transferring significant economic power,
including the right of taxation, to the republics. It also
envisages breaking up government monopolies, selling state-owned
property to private citizens, and converting collective farms into
private plots.
   Gorbachev's program was a compromise between the 500-day plan
and a more cautious reform plan proposed by Prime Minister Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov. The compromise omits any timetable, although officials
suggested it would take one and a half to two years to put into
effect.
   The compromise also would leave the central government with
strong economic powers, including control over the money supply,
banking and taxes. It hedges on decollectivization, calling for the
rental, rather than sale, of land to private farmers.
   Yeltsin and other critics of the compromise have charged it
would produce rapid inflation by lifting state price controls and
indexing workers' wages and benefits to rise accordingly.
   The 500-day plan calls for retaining price controls on key
commodities and household necessities, such as food and clothing,
throughout the transition period.

   An office was burglarized in the home of
Democratic Senate candidate Harry Lonsdale, and computer discs
containing campaign material were stolen and files were ransacked,
campaign aides said.
   The intruder broke a door to get into Lonsdale's house Tuesday
night or early Wednesday in a remote area 12 miles west of Bend,
said campaign press aide Dan Walter.
   Walter wondered if the break-in was politically motivated.
   ``We're not saying it is, but certainly six days out from the
election it raises questions,'' Walter said.
   Lonsdale's opponent, Sen. Mark Hatfield, called it ``deeply
troubling to us'' that such an incident would happen.
   ``It's extremely unfortunate, but even more unfortunate ... to
try to pin that on the Hatfield campaign,'' said the Republican
senator.
   Also missing were an office computer, printer, video recorder
and telephone. A secretary discovered the burglary when she arrived
at work Wednesday.
   Campaigning in southern Oregon, Lonsdale said ``I wouldn't want
to accuse anybody of anything.''
   Meanwhile, campaign finance reports show Hatfield has raised
more than $379,000 since Oct. 1, much of it from congressional
Republicans and wealthy industry groups.
   Through Oct. 24, the Senate's second-most senior Republican had
gotten campaign contributions totaling more than $1.3 million.
   That doesn't include more than $100,000 Barbara Bush helped
raise for him in Portland on Monday.
   The campaign of Democrat Lonsdale also reports donations in
excess of $1 million, but $729,000 came out of his own pockets. He
refused to take money from political action committees. The latest
polls show Lonsdale with a slight lead.
   About $150,000 of Hatfield's money collected since Oct. 1 has
come from PACs and another $40,000 has come from Republican
candidates, GOP committees and clubs. For the year, his PAC total
is more than $416,000.
   As the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee,
Hatfield plays an influential role in spending bills cutting across
a wide range of industries. His biggest PAC donations since Oct. 1
include: McDonald's PAC of Oak Brook, Ill., $5,000; American Family
PC of Georgia, $5,000; Reynolds' Metals Co., $4,000; Fred Meyer
Federal PAC of Portland, $4,000; Realtors PAC of Portland, $4,000;
AMOCO PAC, $3,000; Union Pacific Fund for Effective Government,
$3,000; and Weyerhaeuser Special Shareholders PAC, $3,000.
   The Republican Senate Inner Circle, a fund-raising arm of the
National Republican Senatorial Committee, has given Hatfield
$62,800 this year, including $20,000 on Oct. 9.
   Since Oct. 1, he has received $1,000 each from committees set up
by:
   Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island, Thad Cochran of
Massachusetts, William Cohen of Maine, Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
Jake Garn of Utah, John Heinz of Pennsylvania, James Jeffords of
Vermont, John McCain of Arizona, James McClure of Idaho, Frank
Murkowski of Alaska, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Bob Packwood of
Oregon, Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Alan Simpson of Wyoming,
Steve Symms of Idaho and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
   Hatfield also picked up $5,000 each from the Colorado
Republicans Federal Campaign Committee, Texas Republican
Congressional Committee and National Republican Congressional
Committee. He got $4,000 from the Senate Victory Fund and $1,000
from the Paul Laxalt Group.

<TEXT>
   Stanford University's marching band
won't be marching for a while after offending Oregonians with a
halftime spoof of the spotted owl timber controversy.
   The ``Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band,'' known for shows that poke offbeat fun at current events,
was banned from the field for one game because of a weekend
performance in Eugene, Oregon.
   Offended spectators from the University of Oregon booed and
Stanford's own supporters swamped its athletic department with
angry telephone complaints.
   The band Saturday took on the northern spotted owl, a threatened
species at the center of a bitter battle between the logging
industry and environmentalists. Measures to protect the owl's
habitat in the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest are
opposed by loggers who say their livlihood is threatened.
   ``Trees and spotted owls are disappearing like crazy and
everybody wants to know why,'' the announcer said during the
halftime show.
   ``Mr. Spotted Owl! Mr. Spotted Owl! Your environment has been
destroyed, your home is now a roll of Brawny (paper towels) and
your family has flown the coop,'' the announcer continued. ``What
are you going to do? `Me, I'm going to Disneyland!' ''
   Band members spelled out ``spot,'' then formed ``pot'' on the
field.
   Slogans and signs at demonstrations over the owl controversy
often depict the threatened bird as a menu item.
   The Oregon Ducks and their fans were not amused by the show.
   ``The Stanford band is known for this kind of shtick. I guess
they must try to be obnoxious,'' said Steve Paul, band director at
the Oregon school. ``This game, they ridiculed the logging industry
and the environmental movement and lots of fans were offended.''
   ``It would be like if my band came down to the Oakland Coliseum
and made light of the earthquake,'' said Don Jackson, principal of
South Eugene High School. Many Oregonians have suffered personal
losses from the closing of paper mills, he said.
   It wasn't the first time the Stanford band has been banned. The
marchers were suspended in 1986, when six band members dropped
their pants during a nationally televised game.
   In a 1975 performance, the band offended spectators over the
Patricia Hearst kidnapping when they formed a ``Hearst-Burger'' -
``all buns and no Patty.''
   The band won't be marching in this weekend's game against
Washington State. Stanford said the musicians could march in two
later games, including the big game against the University of
California at Berkeley, only if the scripts were acceptable.
   ``The band is controversial, so we always have fans who really
like them and some who don't like their performances. But this one
reached a point where we needed to act,'' said Cheryl Levick,
associate athletic director at Stanford.
   ``They were angry at the band's performance, the selection of
the script, the insensitivity to the situation in Oregon. They were
embarrassed,'' she said of the complaints.
   The band's student manager, Linda Kaye Brown, agreed the players
should have shown greater sensitivity.
   ``What we do is political satire. We are certainly sorry that
some people misinterpreted it. It wasn't an attempt to mock them or
their way of life,'' she said. But Brown also called the suspension
unduly harsh.
   ``Our goal was to entertain, not to offend,'' she said.
   Alan Cummings, Stanford's acting athletic director, blasted the
band's ``insensitivity and disrespect to the Oregon community'' and
said his department ``will not be embarrassed again by the band.''

   President Bush's approval rating has stopped
falling, according to another poll reported Wednesday night.
   ABC News said a survey of 1,010 people from Friday through
Tuesday showed 55 percent approving the president's job
performance, up from 51 percent in a group surveyed Oct. 24 through
Sunday.
   The difference in the two figures is only slightly larger than
the likely margin of uncertainty in the polls.
   Some other recent polls have shown the president dipping as low
as 48 percent.
   Seventy-five percent of respondents in an ABC poll on Sept. 9
approved of Bush's handling of his office. That proportion fell to
65 percent on Oct. 7, 56 percent on Oct. 14 and 51 percent Sunday.
   During that period, the U.S. military buildup in the Persian
Gulf continued with no resolution of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
Also, Bush and Congress could not agree on a new budget, a struggle
that was resolved only this past weekend.
   ABC said the likely margin of uncertainty in its latest poll was
3{ percentage points either way.

   A 5-year-old girl who was taken away
from her mother after police found her in a locked car should be
returned home, a judge ruled Wednesday.
   The child will be reunited with her mother ``as soon as therapy
and other supports are put in place,'' but no later than Friday,
said Family Court Judge John Callahan.
   The case attracted national attention and an outpouring of
support from New Jersey residents after Chante Fernandez, a single
mother, told authorities she left her daughter in the car while she
worked because she couldn't find adequate or affordable child care.
   Ms. Fernandez said she received offers of jobs and child care
services, hundreds of letters and more than $1,000, which she used
to start a trust fund for her daughter.
   She said she has yet to decide on a job, but will choose one
full-time, week-day position. ``Weekends belong to my daughter from
now on,'' Ms. Fernandez said.
   Ms. Fernandez spoke at a news conference at her attorney's
office in New Brunswick, 20 miles southwest of Newark.
   She also said she would cooperate with state officials
overseeing her daughter's care.
   The New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services placed the
girl, Anjuli, in foster care after her mother's Oct. 20 arrest.
   Ms. Fernandez, 24, was jailed after police found her pajama-clad
daughter locked in a car in a shopping mall parking lot. The mother
had a weekend sales clerk job at a department store.
   Ms. Fernandez pleaded guilty Oct. 26 to a disorderly persons
offense and was given a $100 suspended fine.
   Callahan said the state would maintain legal custody of the
child, pending a progress report to the court within 30 days.
   Division and state officials The Associated Press reached by
telephone Wednesday night declined to offer specifics on the
therapy or support being offered the Fernandez family.
   Ms. Fernandez' attorney, Ken Weiner, told the news conference
his client took the weekend job at a department store to help pay
for her child's schooling. She also worked weekdays as a secretary
at a lumber company, and her combined salary was less than $500 a
week, she has said.
   Ms. Fernandez' father had provided $300 a month toward school
expenses, but he died in January, Weiner said.
   ``This is a poor woman's plight,'' Weiner said. ``She is a
single custodial parent working not five days a week, but seven
days a week. This was one lapsing judgment.''

   Greed, drugs and a lust for Hollywood glamour
led to the producer Roy Radin's murder, a prosecutor told jurors
Wednesday as the ``Cotton Club'' case began.
   But the lawyer for a key defendant called the case as a
frame-up.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn said he would prove that
three men on trial killed Radin seven years ago on the orders of
Miami cocaine dealer Karen Delayne ``Laney'' Greenberger, a
co-defendant.
   Conn said Mrs. Greenberger feared being cut out of profits from
``The Cotton Club'' movie deal she helped arrange between Radin and
producer Robert Evans.
   Evans is a former head of Paramount Pictures who invoked Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination and declined to
testify at a preliminary hearing last year. He is under subpoena
for the trial.
   Mrs. Greenberger's lawyer blamed the Radin killing on one of her
lovers, alleged Cuban drug dealer Milano Bellechasses, and
implicated another former lover who is on trial with her.
   ``Laney Greenberger did not hire, did not pay anyone to kidnap
or murder Roy Radin,'' said Miami lawyer Edward Shohat. ``She
didn't do it.
   ``It is true, unfortunately, that Laney Greenberger was at that
time of her life a drug dealer,'' he added. ``But that does not
make her Roy Radin's killer.''
   He suggested Radin's death was the result of a drug theft
unrelated to the movie deal and that men who surrounded Mrs.
Greenberger framed her.
   ``You will see that Laney Greenberger was set up, was used, was
literally and figuratively framed to the take the rap for the
murder of Roy Radin,'' Shohat said.
   The attorney said Mrs. Greenberger tried to warn Radin he was in
danger the night of the killing, telling him: ``There are all these
men around me and I have no control.''
   Mrs. Greenberger, 43, once was Evans' girlfriend. The three men
on trial with her were once bodyguards for ``Hustler'' magazine
publisher Larry Flynt.
   She is accused of hiring William Mentzer, 41, her former lover,
and Alex Marti, 29, to do away with Radin. The fourth defendant,
Robert Lowe, allegedly drove the car to the killing site.
   ``Each of the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap
and kill Roy Radin,'' Conn said. ``And each defendant did it for
one purpose only, for financial gain and for their own personal
greed.''
   Radin, 33, has been described as a man of excesses, an obese,
cocaine-sniffing impresario from New York's Long Island who sought
to expand his show business connections to Hollywood.
   The jury was told how Mrs. Greenberger arrived at Radin's hotel
in a chauffeur-driven limousine the night of May 13, 1983. Conn
said that en route to dinner at La Scala in Beverly Hills, the
limousine stopped, Mrs. Greenberger got out and Mentzer and Marti,
toting guns, got in.
   Radin was taken to a remote canyon and shot at least 10 times in
the head, Conn said. He described Mentzer putting a stick of
dynamite in Radin's mouth, then igniting it to destroy his face and
prevent identification.
   Outside the jury's presence Shohat asked again to sever Mrs.
Greenberger's trial from her co-defendants so that he could more
openly discuss the three men. Superior Court Judge Curtis Rappe
refused.
   Shohat suggested to jurors that Mentzer, who was hired by Mrs.
Greenberger as a bodyguard and became her lover, also worked for
Bellechasses. He was Mentzer first warned her she might be cut out
of profits from the ``Cotton Club'' deal.
   Shohat acknowledged that Mrs. Greenberger worried about losing
her share in ``The Cotton Club.''
   But he insisted she was more upset about the theft of $1 million
in cocaine and cash from her Sherman Oaks home. He said she hoped
the ``Cotton Club'' profits would help make up the loss.
   All four defendants could face the death penalty if convicted.

   Two federal courts on Wednesday upheld a stay
of execution for a man convicted of killing four people during a
robbery a decade ago.
   Maurice Oscar Byrd had been scheduled to die by lethal injection
at 12:01 a.m. CST Thursday. But the execution was blocked last week
by a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which wanted to hear more arguments in the case.
   That ruling was appealed to the entire court by the Missouri
Attorney General's office, but the nine judges - in a 5-4 decision
- refused Wednesday afternoon to lift the stay of execution.
   The state appealed again, but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
stay Wednesday evening.
   Byrd, who has been on death row since 1982, would be the fifth
Missouri death row inmate to be executed this year and the sixth in
two years.
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to resume use of the
death penalty in 1976, there have been 141 executions nationwide.
   Officials at the Potosi Correctional Center, about 75 miles
south of St. Louis, said they were making preparations to carry out
the execution in case the stay was lifted.
   ``He seems to be in a good frame of mind,'' said prison
spokesman Phil Banks, who said he had spoken with Byrd. ``He's just
quietly watching television.''
   Byrd, 35, was convicted in 1982 of shooting to death a cafeteria
manager and three cooks in a shopping mall in the St. Louis suburb
of Des Peres. Authorities said the employees were herded into the
manager's 10-by-10 foot office Oct. 23, 1980, and gunned down one
by one as they stood.
   Byrd confessed to the murders in May 1981 after being arrested
in Savannah, Ga., for the murder of a liquor store employee.
   Byrd's appeal is based on two issues: the composition of the
jury and the requirement for unanimity among jurors on certain
instructions during the sentencing phase.
   The 8th Circuit found that the Missouri Supreme Court refused to
review those issues when it said that Byrd had exhausted his state
remedies.

<HEAD>Republicans Have New Gubernatorial Nominee, Second Spot On Ballot
In Doubt</HEAD>

   Less than a week before the election,
Minnesota Republicans have a new gubernatorial candidate, but the
lieutenant governor spot on the GOP ticket remained in doubt
Wednesday.
   The secretary of state delayed the printing of supplemental
ballots to reflect John Grunseth's withdrawal from the
gubernatorial race until after his running mate makes her case in
court for staying on the ballot.
   ``There's no precedent for any of the decisions I've made,''
Secretary of State Joan Growe said. ``I think we have to anticipate
anything at this stage, given the kind of year we've had.''
   Grunseth, the GOP nominee, dropped out of the race Sunday amid
allegations he tried to get teen-age girls to swim nude with him
nine years ago and had a mistress during both of his marriages.
   Arne Carlson, the runner up in the GOP primary who later mounted
a write-in campaign, was chosen by the state Republican Party's
executive committee to take Grunseth's place on the ballot.
   The 14-member committee later decided the party wasn't empowered
to fill the vacancy, but Growe said state law required Carlson, as
the GOP primary runner-up, to become the nominee. He faces the
Democratic incumbent, Rudy Perpich.
   Because the governor and lieutenant governor run as a team in
Minnesota, Growe also decided that Joanell Dyrstad, Carlson's
write-in running mate, should replace Grunseth's running mate,
Sharon Clark, on the ballot, even though Clark didn't withdraw.
   Clark petitioned the Minnesota Supreme Court to reverse Growe's
decision. Arguments were scheduled for Thursday.
   ``I have won the endorsement of the party. I have won the
primary election and I have been certified by the state Canvassing
Board,'' Clark said. ``I have a constituency of my own and that
constituency deserves to be represented on the Republican ticket.''
   Growe, a Democrat, said she also delayed the printing of ballots
because it was possible other legal challenges may be filed. She
said she will wait until Friday before directing county auditors to
print ballots with Carlson's and Dyrstad's names.
   ``I believe we need to wait until the final resolution of the
matter in the courts,'' Growe said.
   Republican Party Chairman Bob Weinholzer said he hadn't heard of
additional legal challenges.
   ``It appears like she (Growe) is encouraging somebody to file a
lawsuit because she keeps talking about it,'' he said.
   Carlson, a moderate who often has been at odds with the GOP's
dominant conservative faction, won unanimous support from the
party's executive committee.
   ``Realistically, 99 percent of the people vote for governor, not
lieutenant governor,'' Weinholzer said.

<HEAD>Craig Russell, Mae West Impersonator, Dead at 42</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Craig Russell, who delighted and sometimes
shocked audiences with his impersonations of Mae West, Judy Garland
and Peggy Lee, has died of a stroke resulting from AIDS. He was 42.
   Russell died Tuesday night at Toronto Western Hospital, said
spokeswoamn Lucie Baistrocchi. He had learned he had AIDS in March.
   Born in Toronto, Russell became enamored of show business after
a brief meeting with Mae West in 1965. At 17, he moved into her
house in Los Angeles and worked as her part-time secretary.
   After an apparent dispute, Russell returned four months later to
Toronto to study hairdressing.
   ``She was about as funny as the Ten Commandments,'' he was later
quoted as saying.
   Russell remained a devoted fan, however, and years later the
walls of his apartment remained covered in memorabilia given to him
by the movie legend.
   His first stage appearance was during Christmas 1970, when he
impersonated Tallulah Bankhead at a gay club in Toronto. For years
he was among the best-known female impersonators in North America.
   His performance in the 1977 film ``Outrageous,'' in which he
played a flamboyant drag queen, won Russell an unusual distinction
- both the best female and best male actor awards at the Virgin
Islands Film Festival.
   His career soured in 1981 when a four-city tour of Western
Canada was canceled after Russell undressed onstage and threw wigs
and jewelry at the audience.
   He was later barred from a talk show in Vancouver when he
advised the women viewers, ``If you can't sing, dance or act, you'd
better marry a politician.'' Margaret Trudeau, wife of Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau, happened to be on the set and slapped him
in the face backstage.
   ``He had no discipline,'' said Gino Empry, Russell's publicist
and manager. ``If he had harnessed his talent, he would have been a
world star. It was his lack of discipline that defeated him.''
   Russell recently released an album featuring a song titled
``Glamor Monster,'' Empry said. Profits from the record will go to
AIDS research.
   In 1982, swaddled in fur and tottering on red high heels,
Russell married Lori Jenkins, a fan with whom he shared what he
called a ``legal friendship.'' Ms. Jenkins was by his side when he
died, Empry said.

   The Transportation Department said Wednesday
it is considering boosting subsidies to commuter airlines to help
them cope with fuel price increases caused by the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Big Sky Airlines, which provides service to Montana and
adjoining states, has appealed to the department to renegotiate its
subsidy, said department spokesman Bill Mosley. Other carriers are
talking with the department informally, he said.
   ``We are looking into it with the eye to doing something about
it, but nothing yet,'' Mosley said.
   The department could cut some service or ask Congress next year
for an emergency appropriation, he said. Congress provided $26.6
million for commuter air subsidies in the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1.
   Jet fuel, also used in the turboprop engines of many copmmuter
airline planes, has roughly doubled in price since Aug. 1, from 60
cents a gallon to about $1.20.
   Big Sky stands to lose $12,000 a month despite $1.5 million in
annual federal subsidies, said Gary Ness, director of the North
Dakota Aeronautics Commission.

   President Bush said Wednesday he was fed up with Saddam
Hussein's harsh treatment of U.S. hostages. Iraq later said it
would allow American families to visit the captives for the
holidays.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a British commander
meanwhile warned the likelihood of war in the region was
increasing.
   But Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed al-Mashat,
said he sought to avoid bloodshed and reiterated Iraq's offer to
negotiate - if other Middle East conflicts were included on the
agenda. The United States has rejected such linkage.
   Mubarak said the Persian Gulf crisis has become so dangerous it
``could explode at any time.'' And he urged ``our brothers in
Iraq'' to realize the danger their Aug. 2 invasion of oil-rich
Kuwait has caused.
   The commander of British forces in the gulf warned that an
attack against Iraq is increasingly likely. Air Chief Marshal Sir
Paddy Hine said a joint team culled from the Royal Air Force, Royal
Navy and Army is developing plans for military strikes.
   ``Saddam Hussein seems reluctant at the moment to accept the
judgment of world opinion,'' he said. ``It is looking increasingly
unlikely that Saddam Hussein will withdraw unconditionally from
Kuwait.''
   Bush said his patience was wearing thin with Saddam over the
1,000 American hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``The embassy is being starved,'' Bush said of the besieged U.S.
mission in occupied Kuwait. ``The people out there are not being
resupplied.
   ``Do you think I'm concerned about it? You're darn right I am.
And what I'm going to do about it - let's just wait and see,
because I have had it with that kind of treatment of Americans,''
Bush said.
   Later Wednesday, an Information Ministry spokesman in Baghdad
said the Iraqi government is prepared to allow families of
Americans in Iraq to visit during the Christmas and New Year's
holidays. No other details were available, and there was no
immediate reaction from the State Department.
   The offer to American relatives appears to be part of an overall
Iraqi offer to all relatives of its ``foreign guests'' to visit the
captives. Several Britons have already done so, including wives
visiting their husbands being held in Iraq.
   ``It's probably just another psychological ploy,'' said Dawn
Bazner, whose husband, Mark, early in the crisis was videotaped
asking Saddam to let foreign women and children go. Speaking from
Palm Desert, Calif., she said, ``I'm hoping that we won't have to
visit (Mark) there ... but if it comes down to it, I will go.''
   A few diplomats have held out at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
defying an Iraqi order to close missions in the annexed nation.
Iraq has cut utilities and surrounded the compound with troops. The
British Embassy also remains open.
   The administration of former President Reagan used the safety of
Americans as a justification to invade Grenada in 1983. The Bush
administration also cited the safety of Americans when he sent
troops to Panama in 1989.
   In Baghdad, Information Ministry Spokesman Latif Jassim said the
United States was spreading ``false reports'' on the conditions of
``foreign guests'' to seek an excuse to attack Iraq.
   Baghdad calls the hundreds of Westerners held in Iraq and Kuwait
to deter attack by the multinational force deployed in Saudi Arabia
``guests.'' Many have been sent to strategic sites as human
shields.
   ``I want to tell you that our guests live in good conditions at
some places better than many Iraqi families, but Bush perhaps wants
an excuse,'' Jassim said.
   CBS Radio quoted Jassim as saying he will make available to U.S.
television networks videotaped messages from American hostages to
their families to show they were not being mistreated.
   The United States has more than 210,000 troops in the gulf
region - the largest force sent abroad since the Vietnam war - and
Washington plans to send 100,000 more. About 100,000 soldiers have
been deployed by other nations.
   The 13-nation force - including troops from several moderate
Arab nations - faces about 460,000 Iraqi troops stationed in
southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia, has led Arab opposition to
Saddam. Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Cairo, Mubarak said he
hoped ``our brothers in Iraq will understand well that the
situation is very dangerous and could explode at any time.''
   If war comes, ``Iraq will be ruined, and (it) will harm all of
us,'' Mubarak said.
   At a news conference in Washington, Iraq's al-Mashat spoke of
peace.
   ``We once more call for a negotiated solution, to have a
political and diplomatic solution. We seek to avoid bloodshed,'' he
said.
   He reiterated that Iraq was ready to begin negotiations on the
crisis if issues such as Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank were included in the talks.
   ``We seek a peaceful solution to all of these questions,''
al-Mashat said. ``All of them together. Now.''
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt announced he is
traveling to Baghdad next week at Saddam's invitation.
   ``I think it's most important now to listen to what the people
in Baghdad think, to listen to whether they think there's a way out
of their isolation,'' said Brandt, who won the 1971 Nobel Peace
Prize for his efforts to bridge the Cold war gap between West
Germany and the Soviet Union.
   About 400 Germans are among thousands of foreigners stranded or
held in Iraq. Brandt said he was going as a private citizen, not a
representative of Bonn.
   Al-Mashat also reiterated claims that Iraqi agents in Kuwait had
seized a secret document showing the CIA and Kuwaiti intelligence
were plotting against Iraq before the invasion.
   Peter Earnest, a spokesman for the U.S. intelligence agency,
said the document is fake.
   In other developments:
   -In Israel, a Defense Ministry official said the army has
distributed 3 million gas masks to protect civilians from a
possible Iraqi chemical attack.
   -Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said his country had asked
Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait, Tehran television reported.
   -The official Iraqi News Agency said Switzerland would ship
about 30 tons of medicine to Iraq.

<HEAD>1,000 March in Duvalierist Demonstration in Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - About 1,000 people marched
Wednesday to support the presidential campaign of the former head
of a paramilitary army that terrorized the nation for nearly 30
years.
   Supporters of candidate Roger Lafontant brandished placards
hostile to foreign intervention and to the council that is
organizing the elections, Radio Metropole reported.
   About 250 Organization of American States and 300 United Nations
observers will monitor elections slated for Dec. 16. The Electoral
Council is still determining whether Lafontant is eligible to be a
candidate.
   A former interior and defense minister under deposed dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier, Lafontant headed the Tonton Macoutes, a
dreaded paramilitary force that kept the Duvalier family in power
for 29 years.
   Human rights organizations have accused Lafontant of many
atrocities.
   In 1987, the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs
linked to the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters at
polling places.
   Lafontant was seated on the roof of a four-wheel drive vehicle
during part of Wednesday's demonstration, which began in a seafront
square at 11 a.m. and dispersed several hours later in the Bel Air
slum, said the radio station.
   Organizers had intended to end the demonstration in front of the
Presidential Palace, where Lafontant was to speak, but access to
the square was blocked by police.
   The demonstration was organized by the Union for National
Reconciliation, a neo-Duvalierist federation which nominated
Lafontant at a meeting Oct. 18.
   Lafontant is charged with plotting against national security,
but the court has never delivered an arrest warrant. Lafontant has
been under army protection since he returned from abroad in July to
run for president.
   ``The army's pampering protection of Lafontant makes us wonder
about the sincerity of its commitment to defend democracy,'' said
presidential candidate Louis Dejoie Jr., a moderate.
   Article 291 of the 1987 Constitution bans criminal supporters of
past dictatorships from running for public office until 1997.
   The Electoral Council has discretionary power to decide on the
eligibility of candidates, and it is to make its decision on
Lafontant's candidacy by Nov. 6.
   In a press release Tuesday, the army high command said it
``would observe the strictest neutrality during the electoral
process.''
   Dejoie said the army had promised to be neutral in 1957, when it
rigged elections in favor of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier. The
army also promised to guarantee security in 1987, Dejoie said.

   A bodyguard for President Patricio Aylwin
was accidentally shot and killed by a colleague Wednesday night in
the underground parking lot of the presidential palace, police
said.
   The accident occurred as the presidential bodyguards were
getting out of their vehicles after bringing Aylwin back to palace
from an official ceremony at a Santiago suburb, officers said.
   ``The firearm of a member of the security detail accidentally
went off, wounding police officer Rosbel Garcia,'' said a brief
communique issued by police.
   Garcia, shot in the back, was rushed to a nearby hospital for
surgery but died a short while later.
   It was not clear whether Aylwin was still in the parking lot
when the accident occurred.
   A local radio station said the officer was the driver of one of
the security vehicles in the presidential motorcade.

   Call it the turkey vote.
   Some voters are pushing ``none of the above'' as a better option
in a year when they think the ballot choices are more suited for
stuffing than for public office.
   The NOTA option has been listed on Nevada ballots since 1976 -
and won six times.
   The idea has attracted attention in Massachusetts, especially
from liberals who are scratching their heads over the choices to
replace Gov. Michael S. Dukakis - Democrat John Silber and
Republican William Weld.
   Silber, a tough-talking university president, alienated some
Democrats with his blunt statements about women and minorities.
Weld, an advocate of conservative stands on fiscal policy and gun
control, offers little comfort to liberals thinking about defecting
from the majority party.
   Both candidates have participated in name-calling and negative
campaigning.
   The Pioneer Valley Pro-Democracy Campaign wants election
officials in six communities to count the NOTA vote this year, says
group spokesman Randy Kehler.
   ``It seems to be striking a very responsive chord,'' he said.
   The group will hand out NOTA stickers to voters on Election Day,
Kehler said, adding that election officials he had spoken to seemed
interested in the group's proposal.
   Margaret Nartowicz of the Amherst town clerk's office said NOTA
votes would be counted in that community.
   Kehler said the NOTA option would be more than a mere expression
of dissatisfaction. If NOTA won more votes than the candidates, he
said, it would force a new election with new candidates.
   ``Voters need this option when the political system is not
giving them candidates to their liking,'' Kehler said.
   In Nevada, the NOTA option has been on the ballot in statewide
races since 1976. But that state doesn't provide for new elections
if NOTA wins. Instead, the candidate with the second-highest vote
count gets the office.
   Don Mello, a former Democratic Nevada state senator, introduced
the NOTA legislation in the mid-1970s after finding widespread
dissatisfaction among voters in the post-Watergate years.
   ``Back in 1975, I would go door-to-door and I found so many
people who said `We would vote for you, but we're not going to
vote,'' Mello said. ``I started thinking `What can I get on the
ballot that will get people to go to the polls?'''
   The NOTA choice gives people a way to register their
dissatisfaction with candidates at the top of the ballot, while
voting for other offices, he said.
   Curtis Gans, who heads the non-partisan, non-profit Committee
for the Study of the American Electorate in Washington, D.C., said
voter participation numbers in Nevada don't necessarily bear out
the theory that NOTA increases voter participation.
   In the 1988 presidential election, Nevada had a 44.8 percent
turnout of eligible voters, below the national turnout of 50.15
percent of eligible voters.
   ``I don't think it will make a lot of difference,'' Gans said of
the NOTA option as a way to bring out the vote.
   Still, he supports the idea.
   ``I'm for it because I'd rather have active protest than passive
protest,'' Gans said.
   Bruce Buchanan, an associate professor of government at the
University of Texas, said he doubts NOTA would introduce real
change into elections.
   ``I think it's a bit of a gimmick in that it's one of those
answers that appeals to people because it seems emotionally
satisfying and would have an immediate impact,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Orders Canadian Companies to Ignore U.S. Ban on Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday ordered Canadian
companies to ignore a U.S. bill that would prohibit them from
trading with Cuba, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said.
   The U.S. proposal has cleared both houses of Congress and needs
only presidential approval to become law. Proposed by Sen. Connie
Mack, D-Fla., and known as the Mack amendment, it would make it
illegal for U.S. subsidiaries abroad to do business with Cuba.
   ``This is an intrusion into Canadian sovereignty,'' Clark said,
adding that diplomatic pressure and protests of the bill have had
no effect.
   The order prevents Canadian subsidiaries from complying with the
Mack bill - if it becomes law - and forces them to notify the
government of any instructions or directives they receive that
relate to the measure.
   ``This action demonstrates our determination to block measures
that infringe on Canadian sovereignty,'' said Justice Minister Kim
Campbell. ``It is the government of Canada which makes the laws and
policies that govern international trade and commerce by
Canada-based companies.''
   The Bush administration has opposed the amendment, but it is
attached as a rider to legislation the president wants, including
measures to implement the trade embargo against Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait.
   The bill has not yet reached the White House and may not for a
few days, a White House official said. Once it is received, the
president has 10 days to sign it or veto it.
   Derek Burney, Canadian ambassador in Washington, said this week
he doesn't know whether Bush will sign the bill.
   ``The complication for them is how they weigh ... their support
for our known view, against the broader interest that this bill is
intended to serve,'' Burney said.
   Canadian subsidiaries that would be affected by the bill did
about $26 million of business with Cuba last year.
   Canada and the United States have been feuding over trade with
Cuba since the early 1960s, when the Americans banned trade with
Havana and first sought to extend the prohibition to subsidiaries
of U.S. firms.
   The Canadian order, announced by Clark and Justice Minister Kim
Campbell, is the first to be issued under 1984 legislation known as
the Foreign Extra-territorial Measures Act.
   The government passed the act after the Bank of Nova Scotia's
Caribbean branches were subpoenaed by a Florida grand jury
investigating drug dealing.

<HEAD>Magellan to Resume Venus Mapping by Nov. 8</HEAD>

   Magellan will resume making pictures of
Venus on Nov. 7 or 8 after engineers fix a computer programming
flaw that is causing a wobble in the spacecraft's twin solar power
panels, NASA said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, a Soviet scientist working on the Magellan project
praised the American mission, but said more spacecraft should be
sent to Venus to better learn how the planet works geologically.
   ``Magellan is a beautiful mission. But this is not the end,''
geologist Alexander Basilevsky said during a weekly briefing on
NASA's closed-circuit television system.
   Basilevsky works for the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences' Vernadsky
Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry in Moscow. He is
one of three Soviet guest investigators on the Magellan project.
   Magellan temporarily suspended its $744 million mapmaking
mission Friday because of the solar panel problem and because its
communications with Earth were being impaired by a lineup of Venus,
the sun and Earth.
   Engineers determined that a flaw in the spacecraft's computer
software was causing the wobble, said Steve Wall, Magellan
experiment representative at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   They problem should be fixed in time to resume mapping Nov. 7 or
8, when the planetary alignment will no longer hinder
communications, Wall said.
   The solar panels are essential for recharging Magellan's
batteries to keep the spacecraft running. But the wobbling hasn't
hurt their ability to gather solar energy.
   The orbiter was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
   At 9 p.m. EST Thursday, the sun will be almost directly between
Earth and Venus. That lineup started hindering Magellan's
communications with Earth more than a week ago.
   Magellan uses radar to penetrate Venus' thick clouds to make
pictures and maps. It will map at least 70 percent to 90 percent of
the planet's surface.
   Since mapping formally started Sept. 15, the orbiter has made
pictures of numerous volcanoes, huge solidified lava flows,
extensive quake faults, Los Angeles-sized meteorite impact craters
and 600-mile-wide, mile-high bulges created as molten rock pushes
upward from inside the planet.

<HEAD>Trade Unions Join Strikers on the Daily News Picket Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500 unionists joined striking Daily
News workers Wednesday at a raucous, old-fashioned labor rally
outside the News building, portraying the newspaper battle as a
fight to save all unions.
   Pickets were buoyed when News columnist Jack Newfield, a
management employee with ties to the city' unions, resigned. He
took a job at the New York Observer.
   ``If this strike succeeds, it's because the whole city is behind
us,'' said News feature writer Nancy Stedman. ``It's now about the
survival of unions.''
   Also on Wednesday, Daily News publisher James Hoge met with
Mayor David Dinkins to discuss Dinkins' suggestions about resolving
the strike.
   Hoge, who earlier this week declined to attend a meeting with
Dinkins and union representatives, said he would not consider any
of the mayor's suggestions until ``terrorism by union members''
against newsstand operators stops.
   The mayor would not reveal to reporters his suggestions to Hoge.
   The strike of eight unions began Oct. 25. The Newspaper Guild,
representing reporters and other editorial employees, joined the
strike the next day, following months of negotiations over
contracts that expired in March.
   The unions charged unfair labor practices following an incident
that prompted some drivers to walk out of the News' Brooklyn
printing plant. The drivers led the strike hours later.
   There have been acts of violence since. Police arrested more
than 20 strikers. Vendors allege they have been threatened if they
sell the News and delivery trucks have been burned.
   One newspaper truck driver claimed he was shot at Wednesday on a
Queens highway, but neither police nor a security car following the
truck could confirm shots were fired.
   In an editorial Wednesday, the News said: ``Every business and
business person stands under this threat: Capitulate to the brutes
or your business will be trashed or burned. You will be beaten - or
worse.''
   The News asked readers to demand that dealers restock their
shelves with the newspaper.
   Columnist Newfield, known as a liberal defender of unions, said
he decided to leave the newspaper after spending ``five sleepless
nights'' since the strike began. He said his $90,000 annual salary
will be halved at the Observer.
   ``It's a matter of conscience and self-respect,'' Newfield said.
``If they break the union here, they'll break them anywhere. This
is a big fight.''
   Newspaper Guild President Barry Lipton said 65 to 70 of his 750
members had crossed the picket line. The News reported Wednesday
that 82 of the 350 Guild members in the editorial department were
back, including 30 photographers.
   Newsroom employees had mixed feelings.
   ``I'm still thinking about going back in,'' said Paul LaRosa, a
News reporter who has covered the labor negotiations. ``I came
(Wednesday) with the intention of going in. ... I'll give it
another day.''
   Charles Seaton, a financial writer with 21 years at the News,
told management Wednesday he would come in, but he changed his
mind.
   ``I came to the door. I saw people I grew up with on the line. I
started crying,'' Seaton said. ``I just couldn't go in. It was one
of the horrible moments of my life.''
   Representatives of the News and the drivers' union made no
apparent progress during negotiations Wednesday.
   The Daily News dropped from second to third largest among the
nation's metropolitan dailies, according to new Audit Bureau of
Circulation statistics. The New York Times is the second largest
and the Los Angeles Times is the largest.
   Two national papers, USA Today and the Wall Street Journal, have
larger circulations, making the News the nation's fifth largest
newspaper.
   The News has continued to publish since the strike.

<DATELINE>DEADWOOD, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The take has surpassed everyone's
expectations in the year since slot machines and card games became
legal in this Black Hills town founded during the gold rush of the
1870s.
   Players wagered more than $253 million, and about 75 gaming
houses were licensed during the first 11 months of limited-stakes
gambling in the town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in an
1876 poker game.
   ``This is the best thing to happen to tourism in South Dakota
since Mount Rushmore,'' Franklin Hotel owner Bill Walsh said.
   Actors dressed as Hickok and Calamity Jane will fire guns on
Main Street at noon Thursday to celebrate the first annversary of
legalized gambling's return.
   People wearing Halloween costumes strolled down Main Street
Wednesday night and a best costume contest was held.
   Walsh told reporters Deadwood was reborn over the last year as
gaming halls spent an estimated $35 million to revamp downtown. He
predicted a large turnout for the Thursday celebration.
   ``Deadwood is fun again,'' Walsh said.
   Mayor Bruce Oberlander said the changes have disrupted
residents' lives, but most are pleased with the results.
   ``I think when you go through 20 or 30 years of development in
six months, that's a lot to swallow at one time,'' Oberlander said.
``A lot of people, I think, are happy with what's happening now.''
   A year ago, state and city officials estimated Deadwood's share
of gambling taxes and license fees could give the city about
$500,000 a year to be used to restore aging buildings. The city has
already received $6.2 million as its cut of the first year's
action.
   Gambling taxes also have contributed nearly $786,000 to the
state and more than $196,000 to Lawrence County.
   A statewide vote in 1988 amended the South Dakota Constitution
to authorize Deadwood gambling. The Legislature limited bets to $5.
   Don Gromer, executive secretary of the state Gaming Commission,
said officials expected up to 20 gaming halls with 300 slot
machines and card games to open in the first year. By September,
the 75 gambling halls had 1,900 slot machines, 91 blackjack games
and 27 poker games, he said.
   The gambling industry has created about 1,400 jobs in Deadwood.
Industry officials estimate casinos already have spent more than
$30 million to renovate historic downtown structures.
   Success came with a price, however.
   State and city officials have scrambled to keep tabs on the
rapid growth, which has caused parking problems and strained water
and sewer systems in the narrow city built in a canyon. Retail
stores have nearly disappeared from Main Street as buildings have
been converted into a long stretch of casinos to handle crowds of
gamblers.
   It also has brought a more hectic lifestyle to what was a quiet,
uncrowded town. Among the changes:
   -An association of gaming halls has helped support a local
program that helps gambling addicts.
   -The co-owner of one casino was shot and killed in September in
what authorities said was an apparent attempted robbery. An Air
Force sergeant was charged with murder.
   Mayor Bruce Oberlander said many people are upset that it's no
longer easy to find motel rooms, parking spots and uncrowded bars
when they visit Deadwood. But they don't realize the businesses
were struggling to survive before gambling drew crowds, he says.
   ``If we hadn't done this to Deadwood, we wouldn't have had a
Deadwood,'' Oberlander said. ``It's a changed Deadwood. ... But I
think we've kept a lot of the mystery or romance of Deadwood.''
   Walsh said people who mourn the loss of the old Deadwood are
holding a wake for the wrong corpse. The city's best period was the
boom times of the frontier or the early years of this century, not
the recent years when businesses made money during the summer
tourism season and then tried to hang on during the colder months,
he said.
   ``The old Deadwood was alive with people having fun,'' Walsh
said. ``It's fun again to come to Deadwood, and it's a healthy
experience to see the restoration projects that are being done.''

<HEAD>Egypt, Syria and Saudis Meet to Discuss Possible Arab Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of Egypt,
Syria and Saudi Arabia met to discuss Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's proposal for an emergency Arab summit on the gulf
crisis.
   The official Saudi Press Agency, which made note of the
impromptu meeting, gave no details of the talks among Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid; Syria's Farouk al-Sharaa and
Saudi Prince Saud al-Faisal.
   Diplomatic sources said the tripartite meeting was called for an
``in-depth study'' of the Soviet proposal, made by Gorbachev after
his envoy Yevgeny Primakov conferred with the Iraqi leadership in
Baghdad.
   Primakov later briefed King Fahd in Jiddah, as well as the
exiled emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who has lived
in the kingdom since the Aug. 2 occupation of his country.
   The leadership of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait both said they
appreciated the Soviet efforts, stressing Moscow's adherence to
resolutions calling for unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait
and the restoration of the al-Sabah monarch in Kuwait.
   In Cairo, however, Gorbachev's suggestion that the Arabs should
lead the way in finding a settlement to the 3-month-old crisis was
dismissed by Egypt's leading government-owned newspaper.
   Al-Ahram said in its lead editorial Wednesday that the proposal
``serves Iraqi President Saddan Hussein's strategy of stalling on
the belief that time is on his side.''
   In Baghdad, Information Minister Latif Jassim Wednesday said
there ``cannot be an Arab solution without the American forces
leaving the gulf.''
   The crisis has split Arab ranks; most of the 21 Arab League
members oppose the invasion, but a few - Jordan, the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Yemen, and Libya, among them - have
expressed some sympathy for Saddam.
   Egypt and Syria have led the Arab countries opposed to Saddam.
   Jordan's King Hussein flew to Oman on Wednesday to meet with
leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
Oman is the current chair of the group.

   The mother of an 8-month-old boy cried,
``Somebody killed my baby!'' after the infant was found dead in a
hospital crib, his breathing tube pulled out and his heart monitor
disconnected.
   ``Somebody did this,'' Theresa Bostic insisted Wednesday through
her tears. ``It didn't just come out, somebody did this, somebody
did this.''
   Homicide detectives are investigating the death of Nigel Bostic,
who was hospitalized in Montefiore Medical Center since Sept. 17
for breathing problems caused by a constricted trachea. He was
found dead Monday afternoon, said hospital administrator Fred
Yaeger.
   The boy was found face down in his hospital crib by a nurse
Monday, said Brian K. Regan, vice president of administration at
Montefiore Hospital.
   The infant's cardiac monitor had been disconnected and a
tracheotomy tube, which helped him breathe, had been removed from
his throat and was found under his body, along with the ribbons
that were supposed to hold it in place, Regan said.
   ``This is clearly a tragic situation ... we are doing our best
to find out what happened, we are conducting a vigorous inquiry,''
Regan told a Wednesday news briefing at the hospital.
   A review of the baby's care by a panel of doctors, nurses and
hospital administrators ``found the quality of the nursing care was
very good,'' Regan said.
   Nigel had recovered and was scheduled to be released from the
hospital on either Tuesday or Wednesday, the administrator added.
   Regan acknowledged that the hospital hadn't called the police
after failing to resuscitate the baby because ``at the time of the
death there was no indication of any problem that would require
notification of the police.''
   Regan said the hospital's responsibility was to call the city
medical examiner to report an ``unexplained death,'' which it did
Monday.
   ``It is reasonable and prudent to expect the hospital to call
the police if they see a criminal event,'' said Ellen Borakove, a
medical examiner's spokeswoman. ``They have the same obligation as
anyone else to call the police.''
   An autopsy was completed late Tuesday, but the cause of death
was still under investigation, said Ms. Borakove.
   An initial police report said George and Theresa Bostic didn't
learn of their son's death until Tuesday, more than 18 hours after
it was discovered.
   However, both the parents and Regan said medical personnel
called the parents around Monday evening, summoning them to the
hospital, where they were informed of their son's death.
   The parents then called police.
   Hospital administrators ``did not welcome us with open arms,''
said Sgt. Roscoe Smalls, a detective squad supervisor.
   Mrs. Bostic said only the parents and hospital staff were
permitted in Nigel's room, which was surrounded by windows.
   ``How could anybody see him suffering and not do anything?'' she
asked. ``Somebody had to see my baby suffering.''
   Mrs. Bostic and her husband, a security guard, have older
children from previous marriages. Nigel was the only child from
their marriage.

<HEAD>White House Changes Tune On `Hail to the Chief'</HEAD>

rejected Monday; that rejection was reversed Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MASHPEE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House played a different tune
Wednesday after telling a middle school band it wasn't polished
enough to play ``Hail to the Chief'' to welcome President Bush to
Cape Cod.
   The advance team for the Thursday visit told the school
principal the band couldn't play the presidential anthem because
only military, high school and college bands are allowed to perform
for the president, school officials said.
   The organizers also said the band couldn't handle the song's
``ruffles and flourishes,'' school officials said.
   The rejection came Monday after two weeks of rehearsing, but
community pressure got the White House to bend, said Charles
Liberty, principal of Mashpee Middle School. The advance team
reversed itself and notified the school Wednesday the band will be
allowed to perform the tune, Liberty said.
   The White House referred questions on the matter Wednesday to
the advance team. A member of the team, who spoke on condition of
anonymity said he had thought there was a policy the bands had to
be high-school age or above, but that the rejection was reversed
because of community reaction.
   ``I thought we did'' have a policy on who gets to play ``Hail to
the Chief,'' the team member said. ``We don't want to upset the
community.''
   Not everyone in this Cape Cod town is willing to forgive.
   ``The advance team is afraid the kids are going to choke or play
the wrong thing,'' said band leader Michael Persico. ``They're
crushed. This is the only gift these kids could offer their
president and they're being told it's not good enough.''
   Bush was scheduled to speak for 25 minutes in support of local
Republican candidates, then meet briefly with supporters.
   ``We're really now incensed that our school is good enough to
visit and our kids are good enough to visit ... and now their best
effort isn't good enough for the president,'' said David Robbins,
whose 12-year-old daughter Deborah plays the clarinet in the band.
   Robbins isn't exactly impartial - he's chairman of the
Democratic Town Committee. Other parents, like Robin Trimble,
mother of 13-year-old saxophone player John Trimble, said politics
are to blame.
   ``It seems like politics are coming into it at this point.
Everyone is saying it's the other person's fault,'' Ms. Trimble
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Dismisses Lockerbie Drugs Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American attorney on Wednesday
dismissed a news report that a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency courier
might unwittingly have carried the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight
103 over Scotland.
   Lew Kreindler, leading counsel for U.S. relatives of the
victims, said the NBC-TV report on Tuesday was an ``old story''
that surfaced a year ago in a British newspaper. He said he had no
doubt that the drug policing agency had checked it out and would
continue to investigate.
   An inquiry is taking place in Dumfries, Scotland, into the
December 1988 bombing that killed 270 people aboard the jetliner
and in the village of Lockerbie.
   ``It appears to me that someone wants to focus attention away
from Pan Am security procedures and toward something which relieves
Pan Am of responsibility. It seems to me an attempt to grab public
attention,'' the attorney said.
   He added without elaboration that the Dumfries inquiry was
providing ``good answers.''
   The U.S. drug policing agency said it was looking into the
possibility of one of its couriers being involved.
   The NBC report claimed that Pan American World Airways flights
from Frankfurt were used in a Cyprus-based operation to fly
informants and suitcases of heroin from the Middle East to Detroit
without security checks and that a courier might have been tricked
into taking aboard the airliner a bomb that had been subsituted for
drugs.
   Michael Jones, Pan Am's security manager at London's Heathrow
airport, the last stop of Flight 103, told the Dumfries inquiry
Wednesday that the airline's security was second only to that of El
Al, the Israeli airline.
   Sixty warnings and threats had been received by Pan Am World
Airways so far this year, said Jones.
   He said Pan Am frequently received warnings, bulletins and even
direct threats in the months leading up to the Lockerbie bombing.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Misdemeanor in Hunting Death</HEAD>

   A hunter was charged Wednesday with
accidentally killing a man he mistook for a turkey.
   Game wardens said the victim, Charles Boyer, was crouching near
some bushes and calling turkeys when he was shot in the forehead.
   Boyer wore clothes with blue-gray parches that resemebled turkey
heads, said Lorraine Yocum, a law enforcement supervisor for the
state Game Commission.
   Troy Alan Moore, hunting with a separate party about 90 yards
away, saw blue-gray spots moving and fired at them, grazing Boyer
above the right eyebrow, Ms. Yocum said.
   Boyer, 43, of New Galilee, lost a lot of blood during the 40
minutes it took paramedics to get to the remote spot on a timber
company's property in Deerfield Township, she said. He died shortly
after they arrived.
   Moore, 24, of Tidioute, was booked on a misdemeanor charge of
killing a human being while hunting with a firearm.
   Arraignment was set for Nov. 16. Moore faces a fine of up to
$5,000 and a 10-year revocation of his hunting license if
convicted.
   Unlike deer hunters, turkey hunters in the state aren't required
to wear bright orange because it alerts the birds, Ms. Yocum said.
   Since Pennsylvania's small-game season opened Saturday, three
people have died in turkey hunting accidents, the Game Commission
said.
   A man who in 1988 shot a woman he mistook for a deer was
acquitted earlier this month by a Superior Court jury in Bangor,
Maine.

<HEAD>Two Surfers Attacked by Sharks</HEAD>

   Two surfers were recovering Wednesday
from separate shark attacks that left one man hospitalized after a
shark took his arm in its jaws and ``shook him like a pit bull,'' a
rescue spokesman said.
   Robert Spratt was paddling into position to catch a wave when he
was attacked Tuesday afternoon, said fellow surfer Mike Quintal.
   ``All of the sudden, he went to take the last paddle and a shark
about six feet long grabbed on to his arm,'' Quintal said. ``It
broke the bones and almost bit his arm in half. It was unreal, like
watching a movie. It just came up and latched on and wouldn't let
go.''
   The shark thrashed its tail while Spratt struggled to get free,
said Quintal.
   ``The shark apparently came up and shook him like a pit bull,''
said Brevard County fire-rescue spokesman Mark Francesconi.
``Apparently he had to punch it two or three times before it
released him.''
   Quintal helped Spratt to shore and used his surfboard tether as
a tourniquet until an off-duty paramedic fishing in the area
arrived and bandaged the wound.
   Spratt, 50, of Melbourne Beach, was in stable condition
Wednesday at Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne after
surgery for severe lacerations to his arm, hospital official said.
   About five miles north, another surfer suffered minor cuts on
his left foot in a separate shark attack earlier Tuesday, a city
spokesman said. Mark Evans, 18, was treated and released.
   `This time of year they come in close following the bluefish
that are migrating,'' said shark expert Woody Woodrum. The former
East Coast Shark Club president tags sharks for the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   ``Most of the shark bites come about this time of year when the
water is murky and they come in close to give birth,'' Woodrum
said.

   Vandals painted swastikas and satanic
symbols on a synagogue on Halloween eve, police said.
   ``This ought to serve as a reminder to all of us that there is
still hatred and prejudice and anti-semitism in our world, and all
decent citizens need to eradicate these evils,'' Rabbi Joshua Plaut
said.
   The vandalism at his synagogue, Kol Havarim, occurred Tuesday
night, the traditional Devil's Night, or the eve of Halloween,
police said.
   Police Chief James Thomas said symbols interpreted as satanic
included five-pointed stars and sixes, as in 666, the Biblical
``mark of the beast.''
   Police had no suspects Wednesday.
   The vandalism caused several thousand dollars worth of damage,
Plaut said.

   John Holtyn moved in with his daughter Wednesday,
a day after his tidy home burned in in a Devil's Night arson fire.
Francine Smith watched her garage burn after saving the family
cars.
   The Holtyns and Ms. Smith believe they were among the victims of
arsonists who celebrated the illegal holiday tradition known as
Devil's Night by setting scattered blazes citywide.
   Firefighters and thousands of block-watchers remained on guard
for the tail end of the fire spree Wednesday night and appeared to
be winning; few fires were spotted by reporters driving around the
fog-shrouded city, or reported by citizen patrol groups.
   Thirty-four youths were arrested for violating a special curfew,
police said.
   Although Devil's Night is Oct. 30, the night before Halloween,
arson fires also are set the night before and the night after.
   ``Tonight's Halloween, and the basic thing we're trying to do is
make sure the kids are safe,'' said volunteer patrol organizer Ray
Wright.
   Fire and police officials on Wednesday refused to discuss the
number of fires set. Mayor Coleman Young said the number would be a
revealed a news conference Thursday or Friday.
   Last year, the mayor's office reported 223 fires between Oct. 29
and Oct. 31, with 115 of those on Oct. 30. Leaders of the
firefighters' union, who backed a Young opponent in last year's
mayoral contest, counted there were 412 fires over the three days.
The union's count included blazes in rubbish and in trash bins; the
city counted only structure fires.
   The worst Devil's Night came in 1984, when 810 fires were set
over three days.
   This year's fires left a haze over some commuter routes and cut
visibility to six miles at the city airport late Tuesday.
   ``On the surface it's very, very clear that we still have a
Devil's Night problem,'' Young said Wednesday. ``But those problems
are much more under control today than they were.''
   The Holtyns moved to their daughter's house on Wednesday. Holtyn
said vandals torched the vacant house next door, and the flames
spread to his home.
   ``We just saw a flame next door - something blew and it just
started burning,'' said John Holtyn, 65.
   Ms. Smith clutched her nightgown as she watched flames she
believed to be intentionally set destroy her garage and spread to
another next door. ``What's wrong with people, anyway?'' she asked
Wednesday.
   Patrol organizer Wright said he saw only one small fire in his
neighborhood, down from six area blazes the same night a year ago.
   ``We're trying to really go for zero tolerance for any kind of
incidents like that. We'll be out again tonight,'' he said
Wednesday.
   Wright said his patrol group seized one youth and took him to
the police station. ``He was pouring gas. He was trying to set a
garage on fire,'' he said.
   Block-watchers in some neighborhoods reported no vandalism. ``In
this area we had none, not one brush fire,'' said patrol captain
Sims Charlemagne, whose group represents 20,000 residents living
near the city's western border.
   In southwest and northwest Detroit, ``we have now buried Devil's
Night,'' said Alberta Blackburn, a mayoral aide who coordinated
citizen patrols.
   Edie Albion, who handles claims on hundreds of Detroit
properties for Arlan's Insurance Center, reported just one fire
claim Wednesday. She speculated that the Devil's Night fires
involved mostly vacant, uninsured properties.
   In nearby Flint, 144 fires were reported Tuesday night, down
from 194 the same night the year before, said Assistant Fire Chief
Ron Downing.

   Nervous lawmakers are urging President Bush to
be patient and let the international trade embargo against Iraq run
its course before using force in the Middle East.
   ``We're saying, play out the sanctions. See how long this
goes,'' Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said after he and other
congressional leaders met with Bush on Tuesday.
   ``The general thrust was, don't do anything unilaterally. If we
are going to proceed to ratchet this up, it should be under the
United Nations umbrella. Caution is the word here,'' said Fascell,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The meeting followed two days of tough talk by the president and
his top officials on the Persian Gulf crisis, which included
warnings that the United States would not hesitate to use force if
provoked.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is
investigating whether one of its undercover couriers may have
unknowingly carried the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland.
   The December 1988 bombing, which killed 270 people aboard the
plane and in the village of Lockerbie, has been attributed by law
enforcement authorities to a pro-Iranian terrorist group.
   Investigators said the terrorist group put plastic explosive in
a tape recorder in baggage that was shipped from Frankfurt,
Germany.
   NBC News, which first reported the new DEA investigation Tuesday
night, said it had learned that Pan Am's flights from Frankfurt had
been used in a Cyprus-based undercover operation to fly informants
and suitcases of heroin from the Middle East to Detroit.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - With voters in an anti-government snit, many
candidates are trying hard to show their warm, fuzzy sides in the
final week of the election season.
   Children, music, personal drama and high-minded sentiments
generally make a comeback at the end of any political campaign. But
strategists say the soft landing is especially important this year.
   ``The level of disgust is much higher,'' said Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake. ``You need to offer an alternative, be seen
as someone who doesn't seem political and will cut through all of
this mess.''
   That's not to say hard-hitting advertising and attacks have
vanished. Many strategists believe long-shot challengers and
candidates in tight races must keep up the barrage if they want to
win.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An American reconnaissance satellite written
off by the Soviets and others as an expensive failure apparently is
alive and spying after all.
   First, three men in Europe separately spotted it orbiting 503
miles high. Then a computer programmer in Canada followed a trail
of mathematical clues to the conclusion that the object is the
satellite launched from the shuttle Atlantis on March 1.
   It apparently has been there all along, said Ted Molczan of
Toronto, who took the observations of three other satellite
observers and tracked its course backward to the hush-hush launch.
   The Atlantis mission was secret and all the Pentagon said about
it was that it achieved its goal. Whether that referred to a safe
shuttle flight or a new operational spy satellite was left to
conjecture.

   CALAIS, France (AP) - Workmen tunneling under the English
Channel have created the first land link between Britain and the
Continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of
engineering and finance.
   TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the
``Chunnel'' said the historic linkup occurred at 8:25 p.m. Tuesday
when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to
their French colleagues.
   Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing
unification of Europe. It also fulfills a dream of Napoleon, who
wanted to send his armies through a tunnel to conquer Britain.
   Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the
world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to
pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993.

   DETROIT (AP) - Firefighters smothered blazes scattered
throughout the city overnight as thousands of volunteers walked the
streets to deter arsonists on Devil's Night, Detroit's annual
Halloween eve fire spree.
   Fire officials refused to say how many blazes they fought, but
some volunteers said they believed there were fewer than last year.
Police said arrests for violating a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew were
down by more than a third.
   One volunteer patrolling the streets, Ray Wright, said he saw
only one small fire in his neighborhood.
   ``It's definitely down from last year,'' he said.

   MOSCOW (AP) - Tamara Skiba was 20 when she was sent to the
Kargopol labor camp in the Soviet north. By the time she got out
nine years and seven months later, she was an old woman.
   ``They broke my spine and took out my female organs. They ruined
one ear and pulled out almost all my teeth,'' she said, pulling
back her withered gums to reveal rows of false teeth.
   Mrs. Skiba, 63, was among an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 Soviets
who marched to the headquarters of the KGB security police on
Tuesday night for the unveiling of a monument to victims of
political repression.
   The daughter of a high-ranking army officer, she was arrested
and charged with spying for the West when her father fell out of
favor with Josef Stalin in 1947. A decade later, after Stalin's
death, she was released and rehabilitated - given a clean political
bill of health - by Premier Nikita Khrushchev.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - For a kid growing up in the post-World War II
suburbs, it was a comforting world of Captain Kangaroo on the tube,
a new washing machine in the basement, a shiny gas guzzler in the
carport and a bomb shelter in the back yard.
   ``This is our childhood,'' said Roger G. Kennedy, director of
the National Museum of American History, where he introduced a new
exhibition that takes a nostalgic look at the lives of children
born during the Cold War years.
   Kennedy meant not only the childhood of the current baby boom
generation of parents but, in a deeper sense, the innocence of a
nation that yearned only for peace and the emblems of middle-class
prosperity.
   The show, titled ``This is Your Childhood Charlie Brown:
Children and American Culture, 1945-1968,'' opens today at the
Smithsonian Institution museum for a six-month engagement.

<HEAD>Higher Oil Prices Still Not Enough For `Clean Energy' Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By S.L. BACHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher oil prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis
are giving alternative energy sources another day in the sun, but
they still are too expensive to generate much enthusiasm.
   Officials and commentators in the United States and Japan, the
countries with the greatest appetites for imported oil, are urging
greater use of alternative energy.
   Price Minister Toshiki Kaifu recently told Parliament the
government was ``making a vigorous effort to ensure stable energy
supplies by securing petroleum sources and promoting the
development and use of ... alternative energy sources.''
   Most alternatives still are too costly or technologically
troublesome for large-scale use, however, despite the increase in
oil prices since Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Nuclear, coal and natural gas are competitive to oil, ``but when
it comes to new energy, it will take a long time because of
technical problems and problems of economy,'' said Toyoaki Ikuta,
president of the Institute of Energy Economics.
   ``The problems of economy might be solved by higher prices, but
the technical problems can't be solved'' as quickly, he said.
   Japan's need for new sources first became clear with the 1973
Arab oil embargo, which quadrupled prices. The government began the
Sunshine Project, a research program on such technologies as solar
energy and coal liquefaction.
   Four years later, the government followed with the Moonlight
Project, for technologies like fuel cells, a process to produce
electricity from a chemical reaction.
   Annual budgets of the projects total about $400 million.
   Some of the biggest names in Japanese industry, including
Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Yamaha and Toshiba, are developing wind
turbines, fuel cells and ``photovoltaic'' solar energy converters,
which use sunlight to convert protons into electrons to produce
electricity.
   Obayashi Corp. is pioneering a ``Super Energy Conservation
Building'' it claims needs only a quarter the energy of ordinary
buildings.
   About 2 million home solar water heaters, countless solar cell
batteries and many other clean-energy products suggest new
technologies deserve some credit for cutting Japan's dependence on
imported oil, which has fallen from about three-fourths of total
energy needs in 1973 to less than 60 percent.
   Analysts say that is not the case.
   Liquid natural gas, nuclear power, coal and conservation by
industry are the main reasons for reduced dependence on oil,
according to a study by Masukawa Shigehiko, a business
administration professor at Bunri College.
   The government estimates new energy sources will provide only 5
percent of total needs by the end of this decade, largely because
of technical problems including the unreliability of energy that
varies with the weather.
   Price is a constant obstacle.
   Wind power is competitive at current oil prices, but solar and
fuel cells are not expected to be competitive until the 21st
century, said Hidetatsu Inaba of the New Energy Foundation, which
is linked to the government.
   Oil prices of $50 to $60 a barrel might begin to make solar
power more attractive, said Yoshizo Yasuda, a senior managing
director at Kyocera Corp., which produces photovoltaic solar cells.
   Despite recent remarks by Kaifu and others about the importance
of alternative energy sources, there has been no new Japanese
government funding or initiatives since the gulf crisis began.
   ``The Iraq-Kuwait situation is still only a short-term problem,
so we aren't thinking of changing the long-term plan,'' an official
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.

   Witch doctors told Story Musara his
stomach, distended to double the size of a football, was bewitched.
   Western-trained doctors said the 36-year-old office clerk had
cirrhosis of the liver and his bloated belly was a symptom.
   Evil spirits casting spells was the more believable diagnosis to
Musara, the product of a culture steeped in superstition, but both
healers prescribed similar treatment: tablets and herbs rich in
vitamin B, and lay off those nine bottles of beer a day.
   ``It doesn't really matter what the diagnosis is, just as long
as the treatment is right,'' said Dr. Chris McCormick, who treated
Musara. ``You should never disbelieve the power of traditional
African medicine.''
   About four-fifths of the 9.5 million people in this southern
African nation prefer the mystical rituals and elixirs to Western
medicine, according to a study by the University of Zimbabwe.
   In the last decade, the witch doctors - called n'angas - have
regained some of the respect they enjoyed in ancient African
culture.
   Zimbabwe is one of the few African countries to give them
official status, through the 24,000-member Zimbabwe National
Traditional Healers Association. The association was formed soon
after independence in 1980.
   During British colonial rule in what was called Rhodesia, white
settlers condemned witch doctors as pagans and devil worshippers.
   Nine decades of laws against witchcraft reduced the number of
people learning traditional medicine, and rapid deforestation after
independence made the 500 varieties of healing plants in Zimbabwe
more difficult to find.
   ``It's unfortunate so much has been lost,'' said Gordon
Chavunduka, head of the healers association and a university
professor of sociology.
   ``There was once a time, when people had a pain they just walked
into the bush and picked the plant. The whole country is our source
for medicine and many of us don't realize that.''
   The rediscovery of herbal medicine stems from the high cost of
modern medical treatment as well as tradition.
   A bottle of 30 vitamin C tablets costs the equivalent of $3.25,
nearly a day's pay for the average worker. Visiting a
Western-trained doctor costs up to $10 just for the consultation.
   Going to a n'anga, on the other hand, costs $2.50 to $5,
depending on the illness and form of treatment.
   Joseph Harrison, a 49-year-old n'anga, says many of his remedies
were passed down through generations of his family and new ones
come from his dreams.
   Two of Harrison's remedies are ``hloni,'' an animal quill that,
when pressed to a patient's forehead, discourages enemies from
seeking revenge, and a yellow powder he describes as ``the best
aphrodisiac in southern Africa.''
   Traditional medicine is practiced in many African countries,
   Witch doctors in central Africa suture wounds with the snapping
jaws of live soldier ants. In Tanzania and Uganda, traditional
healers treat epilepsy and blindness with herbs.
   Zimbabwean n'angas in feather headdresses claim they can heal
ailments ranging from sprains to cancer and mental disorders by
throwing bones, chanting incantations and stirring mixtures of
herbs and animal parts.
   McCormick, the physician who treated Musara, said part of the
witch doctors' success was attributable to the belief of their
patients.
   ``I know of several people who have been cured because of their
blind faith in traditional healing,'' he said.
   Sometimes, that faith can have tragic consequences.
   In the reception room of a township clinic a few miles southwest
of Harare, 6-year-old Regis Nyamba lay on a bench, his head swollen
to four times normal size by encephalitis that had made him
permanently retarded.
   He had been taken to a n'anga.
   ``Regis could be a healthy boy today if he came to my clinic
first,'' said a physician treating hin, who asked not to be
identified. ``Healers will have a bash at something and if it
doesn't work, they send the patient to me. By then it is often too
late.''
   Regular doctors accuse traditional healers of being unhygienic
and using untested medicines.
   A Zimbabwean AIDS victim claimed he contracted the deadly virus
from a n'anga who used a contaminated razor in treating him.
   N'angas accuse Western-trained physicians of arrogant
intellectualism.
   ``Some Western doctors don't understand that part of the success
behind traditional medicine is the interplay of the spiritual and
physical worlds,'' said Chavunduka, head of the healers
association.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They circled through St. Patrick's Cathedral,
Lutheran and Roman Catholic clergy, women in white cassocks, men in
black, along a left aisle, then the center, singing ``Lift High the
Cross.''
   The processional, showing both the new, basic cohesion and
lingering external variations of the two traditions, opened a
special service last Sunday, marking the 25th anniversary of
Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue.
   ``This truly is the day that the Lord has made,'' Cardinal John
O'Connor, Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, told the mixed
throng of about 2,000 worshippers.
   Lutheran Bishop William Lazareth, head of the Metropolitan New
York Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, led the
assembly in a joint confession of faith.
   ``We do,'' the people chorused to each of a series of questions
about beliefs in God, his manifestation in Jesus Christ and work of
forgiving grace for humanity.
   Lazareth said Catholics and Lutherans, whose 16th century
founder Martin Luther led the Protestant break from Rome, have come
``closer together in official doctrine, regardless of various
patterns of ethical discipline.''
   Such diversity was evident in the contrasting makeup of about
200 clergy on hand, the Catholics all men, to which that church
limits ordination, while Lutheran clergy included both women and
men.
   But they all walked together on this occasion, and a woman
Lutheran minister, her cassock tied with a red sash, took the high
pulpit to read the gospel from John 8:31-36, beginning:
   ``Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, `If you
continue in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know
the truth, and the truth will make you free.'''
   The Lutheran-Catholic talks, longest running of several
Protestant-Catholic dialogues, began in 1965 near the close of the
Second Vatican Council and its sweeping Roman Catholic reforms.
   ``It has been a remarkable history of interchurch
relationship,'' says the Rev. H. George Anderson, president of
Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and longtime Lutheran co-chairman
of the dialogue team.
   As the team launched a new round of talks at a recent meeting in
Erlanger, Ky., Anderson was succeeded by Lutheran Bishop Harold
Skillrud of Atlanta. Co-chairman for the Catholics is Archbishop J.
Francis Stafford of Denver.
   ``We are moving organically with our various topics,'' says
Stafford, noting that the team now is taking up ways the two
churches use Scripture and tradition.
   On once sharply dividing issues, including those that caused the
16th century split in Christianity, the talks have found broad
areas of convergence and consensus.
   Excerpts from several of these agreements were read at the St.
Patrick's services, interspersed with prayers, hymns, psalms and an
exchange among worshipers of ``Peace be with you'' and ``Christ be
with you.''
   ``Behold how good it is and how pleasant where brothers and
sisters dwell as one,'' the congregation recited from Psalm 133.
   In the 16th century split, key Protestant demands were summed up
in slogans such as ``Only Christ'' as mediator, not Mary or saints;
``Only Scripture'' as authority, not tradition; and ``Only Faith,''
not works, as justifying salvation.
   Reconciling understandings have been found on all those matters,
despite continuing differences in emphasis.
   One of the first agreements came shortly after the talks began,
on the Nicene Creed, setting forth basic Christian beliefs and
affirmed both by Catholics and Lutherans, as well as most major
Protestant denominations.
   Concurring statements came in 1970 on Holy Communion, or the
eucharist, and on ministry, and in 1978 on church teaching
authority, affirming that ``Christ preserves the church in truth''
and in which Lutherans recognize value in a modified papacy.
   An accord in 1983 on justification by faith affirms that
salvation comes only through faith in Christ's ``free gift.''
Adding that faith results in good works, the statment adds: ``Yet
the justified cannot rely on their own good work ... or merits as
though they were not still in need of mercy.''
   A 1990 report on ``One Mediator, the Saints and Mary,'' still to
be released in full, says both Catholics and Lutherans ``agree on
the unique mediatorship of Christ,'' and see that as guiding views
of the saints and Mary.
   Lazareth noted that Catholics see some church teachings as
``infallible'' while Lutherans prefer to speak of the church's
``indefectability'' in referring to God's preserving it from errors
on essentials.
   Such differences should not ``preclude a closer union than now
exists between these two churches,'' he said.
   O'Connor said past battles sometimes have blinded the churches
to ``the basic condition of our understandings and of our unity -
that unity for which Christ himself prayed at the Last Supper,
pleading with his Father that all may be one.''
   In unison, the two bishops - Catholic and Lutheran - intoned
blessings to the people.

<HEAD>Brazilian Wizard Paulo Coelho Turns Himself Into a Best-Selling

   Most wizards make magic with
wands, crystal balls or an old potion or two.
   Paulo Coelho doesn't buy that hokey stuff. He makes literary
magic with a Toshiba personal computer.
   Coelho, a new-wave sorcerer with a touch for turning yarns of
witchcraft and mysticism into best-selling books, has in one magic
leap become Brazil's No. 1 literary sensation. His three novels,
``Brida,'' ``Diary of a Wizard'' and ``The Alchemist,'' have been
Brazil's top best sellers for more than two months.
   The trio, soon to be translated into four languages, have sold
more than 1.3 million copies and grossed almost $1 million in two
years in a nation where half of the population of 150 million is
illiterate.
   ``This is a divine gift from the spirits beyond,'' crooned
Coelho, sitting barefoot on a black couch with leopard fur pillows
in his beachfront apartment, his legs crossed and arms extended in
the ``Lotus'' position to ``attract positive forces.''
   Maybe so, but Coelho has cleverly tapped into Brazilians'
traditional love of African voodoo-style cults, generally lumped
together under the term Macumba and descended from Yoruba and Bantu
religions practiced by slaves.
   Some 90 million Brazilians of all races and classes for years
have freely mixed elements of the predominant Roman Catholicism
with native Indian faiths, European witchcraft and spiritism to
form the uniquely Brazilian cults.
   Last year, nationwide sales of occult books grew twice as fast
as all others, with Coelho leading the blitz.
   ``Magic is inside all of us,'' the author says. ``We can all use
it to find happiness. I merely bring this idea to the people's
eyes.''
   The message has struck a deep chord in a public mired in
four-digit inflation, deteriorating social services and rising
unemployment.
   Coelho's latest novel, ``Brida,'' a steamy tale of a young Irish
woman named Brida O'Fern who is initiated as a witch in Spain's
Pyrenees Mountains, was panned outright by major magazines as an
``esoteric, poorly written jumble of metaphysical tales, drowned in
diffuse mysticism.''
   But Brazilians love it. The 100,000 first edition copies sold
out in weeks as the book roared to top of best-seller lists. A
second edition is due out to meet soaring demand.
   Even President Fernando Collor de Mello and Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello are avid fans, having read all three books.
They've even called Coelho on several occasions.
   ``The more society becomes materialistic, the more people search
for spiritual fulfillment,'' said Nelson Motta, a Rio cultural
editor. ``Coelho's books are about just that - the search for the
soul.''
   Coelho, born in Rio on Aug. 24, 1947, appears to be a man torn
between modern-day logic and ancient superstition.
   After earning a law degree at Rio's Candido Mendes College, he
became a Buddist, Hare-Krishna, Child of God and Shintoist and
indulged in just about every hallucinogenic drug known.
   Coelho tried to be a playwright, journalist and musician. ``But
nothing clicked,'' he said, until he experimented with black magic,
and demons called on him in his Copacabana apartment one night in
1974.
   ``It was two days of horror,' said Coelho, his eyes brimming
with tears. ``But my destiny was forever marked.''
   In 1981, he said he ``felt a craving for the forces'' sold all
his belongings and toured Western Europe, Morocco and Transylvania,
Romania, by car with $17,000 in cash in his pockets.
   During a visit to the Dachau Nazi concentration camp in Munich,
Germany, Coelho says a spirit appeared before him and persuaded him
to become a full-fledged wizard.
   During the five-year initiation, Coelho roamed the far corners
of the Earth - from the pyramids of Egypt, the Sahara Desert and
the Atacema Desert in Chile, to Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion
in Memphis, Tenn.
   In 1986, he completed his oath, walking six hours a day for 70
days from the Pyrenees Mountains along the ``sacred path'' of
Spain's northern coast to the city of Santiago de Compostela.
Coelho says the Regnum Agnus Mundi order is an honorary, sacred
society of wizards founded in 1492 by a group of magicians in a
tiny village in northern Spain.
   He drew on his travels to write the ``The Alchemist'' and
``Diary of a Wizard,'' both of which are now in their 39th
editions.
   Today, Coelho hardly cuts the image of a wizard. He sports
running shoes, bleached jeans, T-shirt and leather jacket, silver
bracelet and a butterfly tattoo on his left forearm.
   The only drug he takes now is aspirin. His salt-and-pepper hair
and Fu Man Chu beard are kept meticulously trimmed.
   Coelho's home office smacks of corporate taste: architect lamps,
chordless telephone, computer, file cabinets, FAX and answering
machine with a message giving callers a spiritual blessing.
   Only the framed wizard diploma from the Spanish order Regnum
Agnus Mundi, his 18th-century steel sword and wooden serpent
scepter hint the presence of a sorcerer.
   His manner direct and disarming, Coelho has mastered media
promotion. One TV talk show host recently asked what powers he
possessed, and Coelho responded wryly: ``I can control the wind.
Just let me know what direction and I'll pucker up and blow.''
   But Coelho doesn't take the spirits lightly. Three times a day
he locks himself in a room, sitting crosslegged and wearing his
black cape, to meditate.
   Despite the deluge of fan mail and phone calls from bankers,
stock brokers and corporate executives asking for spiritual advice,
Coelho refuses to give private sessions, read cards or palms or
tell fortunes.
   ``If I opened a magic school or started my own religion, I'd be
rich,'' he said. ``But the spirits would strike me down if I did.''

<HEAD>Big Guns Out Stumping for State Seats With Reapportionment in Mind</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every fifth election, high-profile national
politicians rediscover the candidates in the low-profile campaigns
for seats in the state legislatures.
   This is one of those years.
   With congressional redistricting coming up, intense, costly
campaigns shaped and subsidized by the national parties are being
waged for swing seats in targeted legislatures.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats at stake in 46 states on
Tuesday. If fewer than 50 of those seats change parties - in just
the right branches of just the right legislatures - it could have a
marked impact on congressional elections for the next decade.
   That's why Vice President Dan Quayle had lunch one day last week
at an elegant home in suburban Philadelphia, an exclusive,
$2,500-and-up affair that bankrolled a final campaign push by
candidates seeking to hold the narrow Republican edge in the
Pennsylvania state Senate. The Republican National Committee said
the event raised $150,000.
   President Bush, Ronald Reagan, and Cabinet members also have
been active in the Republican drive to elect more legislators,
looking for leverage when political draftsmen sit down next year to
chart new congressional districts.
   ``There's never been a cycle where we've seen the White House so
actively involved,'' said Norman Cummings, political director of
the Republican National Committee.
   Nineteen House seats will be shifted to reflect the 1990 Census,
most of them into southern and Sun Belt states where Republicans
have run strong in national elections. Eight states will be gaining
House seats, 13 will be losing them, and all the political maps
will have to be redrawn for 1992 congressional elections.
   A state redistricting plan must pass each branch of the
legislature, then be signed by the governor. The party that
controls all three steps can draw district lines that favor its
congressional candidates. The party that holds one of the three can
bargain for better terms.
   Both Bush and Quayle have campaigned for GOP candidates for the
Florida Senate, now narrowly Democratic. Democrats are battling to
reverse narrow GOP majorities in the Senates of Michigan, Indiana
and Ohio, and to hold their edge in Illinois.
   In two of the biggest reapportionment gainers, California with
seven new House seats and Texas with three, Democrats have solid
legislative control. Both are electing governors to succeed
retiring Republicans. In Florida, which gains four seats, a GOP
governor is in a close contest for re-election.
   Overall, Democrats dominate the legislatures and they've waged
an intensive campaign to keep it that way. Tim Dickson, executive
director of their redistricting campaign, Project 500, said the
national party has invested well over $1 million in targeted
legislative races this year, with most of the money spent early in
the year on things like polling, opposition research, consultants
and campaign planning.
   With those sophisticated techniques spreading down the ticket,
the cost of legislative campaigning is going up everywhere. There
are television commercials, computerized mass mailings, telephone
banks with automated messages - all the tools and tactics of modern
campaigning.
   Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste said when he first ran for the
legislature 20 years ago, his campaign cost $9,000. ``Now we have
state senate elections where they spend half a million,'' he said.
   Democrats control both legislative branches in 29 states,
Republicans in 8, with 12 legislatures divided between the parties.
Nebraska's one house is non-partisan.
   The Democrats are trying to reverse narrow GOP margins in some
contests crucial to redistricting - among them Pennsylvania's
Senate, where a Democratic gain of three seats would turn it
around.
   Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey is a runaway favorite for
re-election, and that compounds the problem for Republicans. His
ticket strength could help some Democratic legislative candidates.
And because of his lead, state campaign funds that would go into a
closer gubernatorial test have been trickling down into legislative
contests.
   Republican Cummings said much the same thing is happening in New
York, where Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo is headed toward landslide
re-election and the GOP is trying to hold the state Senate.
   New York will draw new lines for 31 congressional districts
after its likely loss of three House seats in reapportionment. The
new congressional map will have to be approved by each branch of
the legislature and signed by the governor. Holding control of the
Senate would give the Republicans a bargaining position in dealing
with a re-elected Cuomo and a Democratic Assembly. They can't draw
the map, but they could veto it.
   Their situation in Pennsylvania is similar.
   ``Pennsylvania, I believe, loses two congressional seats,''
Quayle said at a campaign stop in Media, Pa. ``They should come
from Democratic districts. That's where the population has eroded.
But if in fact there's gerrymandering going on, obviously
Republican congressmen are going to be in serious jeopardy.
   ``That's why this election is so important.''

<HEAD>Getting Through to A Network Head</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Covering the television industry is a lot
like being stuck in a ``Twin Peaks'' episode. Specifically, the one
from last season in which a dancing midget spoke in reverse.
   Not that there is an unusual number of short people in the TV
business. It's just that mostly, they talk in doublespeak.
   Networks trot out stars and shows, sing their praises in press
conferences and then get rid of them the next day.
   Programming executives get kicked upstairs, only to do the same
job they did before, except now they have bigger, more confusing
titles.
   As a reporter, trying to get the head of network programming on
the phone for an interview means entering reporter hell.
   If it's something that behooves CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox
Broadcasting Co., chances are you can get, say Brandon Tartikoff
(with his new title of President, NBC Entertainment Group) on the
blower in a nanosecond.
   Behooves as in, ``I'd like to interview Brandon on how NBC is
the greatest network in the history of the modern world.''
   Ask a probing question, as in what is ABC going to do about
``Cop Rock'' a ratings bomb that costs big bucks to produce, and
network entertainment president Robert Iger says, ``What we've got
working here is a complicated blend of vested interests.''
   In all fairness, the men who control prime-time programming for
television's four broadcast networks have big, powerful,
time-consuming positions. Talking to reporters is not a daily
priority. Keeping your job is.
   You know you're in a shaky business when the most senior network
entertainment head is 39 years old and has been on the job less
than two years (ABC's Iger).
   With the exception of CBS' Jeff Sagansky, who took over as
entertainment president less than a year ago, the network
entertainment programmers will, from time to time, sit down for an
in-depth interview with a reporter.
   When he does, the two are not alone. The head of publicity also
is present, just in case the programming chief misspeaks. Mostly
it's in case the reporter misspeaks in his or her story. Misspeaks
meaning not just a factual error, but telling the unvarnished
truth.
   This is what makes television journalism different - and more
frustrating - than covering the local zoning board, for example.
   Each network has a dizzying array of publicists whose jobs
consist of making sure that reporters don't bother busy network
executives with dumb questions. And that all information supplied
by the networks is cast in the most positive of lights, i.e. avoid
candor at all costs.
   Shows are not canceled, they are placed ``on hiatus.'' Stars do
not quit or get fired, they have ``creative differences'' (with
whom is not always clear). Programs do not have poor ratings, they
have ``breakout potential'' or ``valuable demographics.''
   Television is not alone in its attempt to put spin control on
every utterance. TV did not invent Oliver North's ``plausible
deniabilty'' or write George Bush's infamous ``read my lips, no
higher taxes'' promise.
   Covering politics, too, is fraught with obstacles to the truth.
So is the cop beat. The window dressing in television, however,
boggles the mind. The networks don't try to conceal their courting
of good publicity. They revel in it.
   Each year they get together and sponsor the press tour, in which
TV columnists and writers from across the country gather in Los
Angeles to be wined, dined and spoon-fed celebrity interviews for
three weeks straight.
   Advance tapes of upcoming television programs arrive by the
mailbag. Fox recently sent TV critics a minature high school locker
crammed with gourmet cookies to promote its new, teen fantasy show
``Parker Lewis Can't Loose.''
   The home network of ``The Simpsons'' also dispatched a box full
of Simpsons dolls, Simpson bumperstickers and Simpson masks to
herald the fall premiere of its hugely successful cartoon series.
   Hey, if you've got the money, spend it. Business is business,
after all. If such trinkets can endear a network to the stoney
heart of a TV critic, more power to Fox.
   Except none of this heightens anyone's job performance. It
doesn't result in better programming, or better reporting about the
world of television or easier access to the people who make the
ultimate decisions about what is beamed into your living room.
   It does, however, blur all the lines between reality and
fantasy, leaving the networks with the mistaken impression that if
they put enough gloss on it and dish out enough money, they can
control every aspect of TV. Including what is written about it.
   All of this makes about as much sense as the new season's opener
of ``Twin Peaks,'' in which a giant offered a profound clue to
finding the murderer of Laura Palmer:
   ``The owls are not what they seem,'' said the extremely tall
man.

<HEAD>Games of Chance Spreading in Bible Belt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOYDTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the Ridge Grocery here, Jack Ricketson's
behind-the-counter observations confirm what polls and pundits say:
Southerners want lotteries just like everybody else.
   Ricketson and his wife Doris, whose tiny store sits on a hilltop
five miles from the North Carolina line, sell livestock feed,
groceries and chances in Virginia's state lottery.
   Most players spend a dollar or two on the games. But folks
passing through from other parts of the South typically bet more -
as much as $20.
   ``It's 'cause they don't have it,'' Ricketson says, meaning a
lottery.
   It appears much more of the Bible Belt will have it in the
aftermath of this fall's elections. Georgians will elect a lottery
backer, whichever gubernatorial candidate they pick Tuesday.
Louisianans last month repealed a constitutional ban on lotteries.
   A pro-lottery initiative in Arkansas was favored in opinion
polls but was knocked off Tuesday's ballot by an Oct. 26 state
Supreme Court decision.
   Only three Southern states - Virginia, Florida and Kentucky -
are among the 32 sponsoring lotteries now. But traditional
opposition, even in fundamentalist areas, shows signs of eroding.
   Will every state in Dixie eventually offer the games?
   ``I think so,'' says Duke University economics professor Philip
Cook, an authority on lotteries. ``The polls as a rule show strong
support.''
   Carolyn Shaw hopes such predictions are wrong. She's with the
Georgia Council on Moral and Civic Concerns, which is using
speeches and mass mailings to try to slow the momentum for a
lottery.
   ``It's as bad as having an illegal numbers racket in your
state,'' she says. ``It's wrong to have the state doing that.''
   Besides, she said, lotteries can become addictive, can victimize
the poor, and can discourage the public from supporting needed
taxation for the functions, such as education, that the games often
support.
   The moral stigma attached to gambling can still be felt.
   At Ross' General Store in the Florida Panhandle town of Century,
many of the cars which crowd the parking lot when there's a big
Lotto jackpot bear license plates from neighboring Alabama. Yet
even while laying down a wad of bills for tickets, some customers
swear they're against the game, says Loretta Hawthorne, the store
manager.
   ``They'll come in here late at night and buy 'em and tell you
they're for somebody else,'' she says with a smile.
   Louisiana voters in October overturned a lottery ban prompted by
a notoriously corrpt game a century ago. Opponents decry the new
version as ``a bloodsucker,'' but supporters say it will add tens
of millions of dollars in revenue to the economically depressed
state.
   In Georgia, surveys of voters have found as much as 72 percent
support for a lottery. The candidates in Tuesday's gubernatorial
election, Democrat Zell Miller and Republican Johnny Isakson,
debate how, not whether, Georgia's lottery should operate. Proceeds
will go to education, both say.
   The fight moves next to the legislature. The Atlanta
Constitution has editorialized, ``A lottery is a poor way to raise
public money. ... Clearly, however, Georgia is going to have a
lottery.''
   Arkansas came close to a lottery vote. Opponents challenged its
constitutionality, and the state Supreme Court less than two weeks
ago struck the ballot proposal, ruling its wording was incomplete.
   In Mississippi, Gov. Ray Mabus backs a lottery to help pay for a
$180 million package of school reforms. In the last legislative
session, the state Senate turned down a House-passed bill to let
voters decide on a lottery.
   North Carolina's state Senate passed a lottery measure for the
first time in the last session, but the House never voted on it.
Lottery bills have gotten nowhere in Alabama, Tennessee and South
Carolina.
   Professor Cook says historic opposition to lotteries, in the
South and elsewhere, has been led mainly by governors and
legislative leaders who were ``resisting the will of the majority
in taking that position.'' Cook is co-author, with Charles
Clotfelter, of the book ``Selling Hope: State Lotteries in
America.'' Both teach at Duke in Durham, N.C.
   Recalling the lottery referendum in Florida, Cook says, ``They
do have their fundamentalist region, but every region of the state
voted for it. ...
   ``People see it as innocuous,'' he says.
   ``Mores of society change,'' says Bruce R. Smith, publisher of
Gaming &amp; Wagering Business, a trade publication. ``Sincere people
in their beliefs who were opposed to gaming in any form 30 years
ago are probably still opposed to it today. Whether they have the
same kind of strength ... I really wouldn't know.''
   Support for lotteries is documented in dollars. For the fiscal
year ended in June, state lottery sales totalled $20.2 billion,
according to Smith. About half goes to payouts, and, after
administrative costs, roughly 37 percent on average is state
profit.
   When proceeds go to ``useful purposes'' such as education or
programs for the elderly, that becomes part of lotteries' appeal,
says Saul Leonard of Laventhal and Horwath, a Philadelphia-based
business consulting firm that produces an annual report on the
gambling industry.
   Another selling point is that ``people have been gambling since
time immemorial,'' Leonard says. Indeed, in the South lotteries
were staged 120 years ago to provide for disabled Confederate
veterans.
   But the basic reason lotteries are spreading isn't their
familiarity or noble goals. It's greed, something that no region
lacks.
   As Leonard puts it, ``People do like to hope for that pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow.''

   It was a quiet night at King Tut's Wah-Wah Hut
bar - if quiet is the word for an East Village saloon where
tattooed toughs gather to booze, play pool and listen to heavy
metal.
   Gradually, a very different crowd filtered in. They wore
T-shirts with the legend ``Queer Nation'' emblazoned over a map of
the United States, and settled in under the ultraviolet-lit
painting of a skull on fire.
   A beefy pool player was about to take a shot when he noticed a
pair of the newcomers standing beside him. His jaw dropped.
   The two men were kissing, mouth to mouth.
   ``Oh no! Oh no!'' the man with the cue cried, retreating in
revulsion to the other side of the table. ``Stop that.''
   They ignored him. This was why they had come - to agitate, to
confront people they blame for an increase in attacks on
homosexuals. They are Queer Nation - one of several militant gay
organizations which have discarded polite persuasion in favor of
grab-them-by-the-lapels defiance.
   There are Queer Nation chapters in San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Boston, Detroit, Philadelphia, Providence, Toronto, Boulder, Colo.,
and Ithaca, N.Y. Four-hundred people attend bi-weekly meetings in
New York.
   Where groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis responded to AIDS
by lobbying for help and by providing services to sufferers, the
new generation - ACT-UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power -
takes to the streets.
   ACT-UP has thrown bagels and noodles at a hotel where President
Bush was appearing, blocked Wall Street, disrupted services in St.
Patrick's Cathedral - all protests against what it claims is
political, business and religious indifference to the epidemic.
   It is ``a whole new attitude,'' said Randy Shilts, a national
correspondent for the San Francisco Chronicle and author of the
critically acclaimed account of the AIDS crisis, ``And the Band
Played On.''
   The new militants are ``rebelling against straight society but
also against older gay people,'' said Shilts, 39.
   It is a pattern that repeats itself in many social movements -
radicalization followed by retrenchment and new radicalization,
said Jim Jasper, an assistant professor of sociology at New York
University.
   ``The newcomers become disappointed in how ossified the old
groups are'' and take their own action, Jasper said.

   ``Any faggot gets within a one-foot range, I'm going to knock
him out,'' the pool player declared loudly to anyone who would
listen.
   But more militants crowded into the little room, outnumbering
the regulars. ``We're here and we're queer, we're here and we're
queer,'' they chanted.
   The chanting grew so loud it drowned out the heavy metal music
and the pool player, who was shouting ``Shut up, shut up'' to no
avail.
   Later, outside the bar, the homosexuals singled out a skinhead
who had shouted a slur. They shouted ``Homophobe'' and pointed
their fingers at him.
   They left. ``We'll be back and we'll be stronger,'' they
chanted. And: ``We're here, we're queer, we're fabulous - get used
to it.''

   It is safe to say that the 50 demonstrators who visited King
Tut's Wah-Wah Hut on that summer night - and had staged a
``kiss-in'' at the Alcatraz bar down the block earlier in the
evening - won no converts. They didn't expect to.
   ``We are breaking down the barriers of unspoken segregation,''
said Queer Nation spokesman Jay Blotcher.
   ``It isn't going to happen in a week. This harkens back to the
Woolworth counter in the South and the blacks coming back again and
again and again. Like them, we are a disenfranchised minority
fighting for our rights.''
   Queer Nation's founders were active in ACT-UP, and remain
members. ``We felt that there were other issues, such as the
increase in violence against gays and lesbians, that had to be
addressed,'' said co-founder Alan Klein.
   Two of the four men who helped found Queer Nation had themselves
been victims of gay bashing, and Klein said the group was formed
because the men felt there was no organized response to attacks on
homosexuals.
   The group organized its first demonstration in April, when a
thousand marchers protested a pipe-bombing outside a gay bar that
injured three people.
   Through Sept. 30 of this year, there have been 88 anti-gay
crimes in New York City, said Capt. Charles Senzel of the police
department's bias unit. Police said there were 47 such crimes for
all of 1989 and 43 for 1988.
   But the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, which provides
legal help and counseling for victims of gay bashing, gave much
higher figures. It listed 425 anti-gay crimes in the city through
the end of September, compared to 338 for all of 1989, according to
David Kirschenbaum, a spokesman for the group.
   Police said privately the wide discrepancy may be due to the
fact that police have to prove an attack was based on the victim's
sexual orientation.
   ``Our message is gays and lesbians will no longer be silent
victims,'' Blotcher said. ``We are here and we're a force to be
reckoned with.''
   Another group, the Pink Panthers, patrols streets to protect
gays. The members carry no weapons, but walkie-talkies, cameras and
whistles. The purpose of the cameras are to photograph gay bashers
the patrols apprehend.
   The group claims 200 members - all trained in self-defense,
according to founder Gerri Wells - and is patrolling Greenwich
Village.
   ``We will hold people for the police and we will bash back if
necessary,'' said Ms. Wells, a lesbian. ``We will use equal force
(to hold a gay basher fighting to escape).''
   The Panthers have not detained anyone since the group was formed
in June but patrols have appeared as gays were harassed on four or
five occasions, she said. The culprits ran when the Pink Panthers
arrived, she said.
   ``Everyone has a right to defend themselves,'' said Inspector
Paul Sanderson, head of the police department's bias unit. ``The
local patrols are good as long as they don't get out of hand. If
they grab someone who's been beating up homosexuals and hold him
until officers arrive, that's the kind of citizens' action that's
needed.''
   ``If I walk with my lover down the street, I face physical or
verbal abuse,'' said Klein. ``That's intolerable. I have to make
important choices. I have to confront that bias. We have to fight
for our rights and I think that can't be compromised.''
   The militants are not always so confrontational.
   Queer Nation goes to shopping malls to distribute leaflets which
note that gays have existed for centuries and which list some
famous people who were homosexual. The leaflets are partially aimed
at gay youths who may be despondent or even suicidal about their
homosexuality, Blotcher said.
   ``There's no positive reinforcement from society for them,'' he
said. ``All you're told is you will live a life of alienation and
disappointment. Adolescents crave acceptance, and this puts some of
them over the edge.
   ``There's nothing out there to tell the kids, `Hey, it's OK,'
and that's why we do this.''

<TEXT>
   In these touchy economic times, people with
money to manage are subjecting even supposedly safe investments to
some painstaking scrutiny.
   When they see the labels ``insured'' or ``guaranteed'' on a
piece of financial merchandise, they are increasingly asking ``by
whom?'' and ``against what risks?''
   This pickiness is only prudent, many advisers on money matters
agree, given the troubled state of the nation's bank industry and
of the markets for investments ranging from real estate to stocks.
   ``Credit contraction is happening,'' says Barton Biggs at Wall
Street's Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in a current financial-strategy
report.
   Or as Martin Zweig, a widely known investment adviser, told
subscribers to his market letter: ``The contraction within the
banking system is beginning to starve the economy for liquidity.
Debt is way too high and is unraveling.''
   This doesn't mean that such peers of the forecasting realm are
predicting the end of the world. Indeed, they suggest, as the gloom
on Wall Street deepens the markets may be getting closer and closer
to a turning point.
   At the bottom of the economic cycle, abundant opportunities
traditionally arise to buy good investments cheap.
   But ``I don't think we're there yet,'' Biggs declares. And the
current slump has produced some peculiar phenomena that are causing
reappraisals of what is safe and what is not.
   The savings and loan crisis, for example, has raised major
questions about how far federal deposit insurance can be stretched.
   The depressed share prices of the nation's biggest bank holding
companies - some of which stand at their lowest levels in a
generation - have also challenged long-held assumptions about the
foundations of the financial system.
   In this kind of environment, savers - and government regulators
- are wary of taking promises of safety at face value.
   In the mutual fund business, for example, the Securities and
Exchange Commission has just effectively barred funds investing in
government securities from using the words ``guaranteed'' or
``insured'' in their names.
   The message to the public, the SEC said, must be clear that
government backing covers only the items, such as Treasury bills or
bonds, in the funds' portfolios, and not the funds themselves.
   And the government guarantee extends only to timely payment of
interest and principal on its obligations. It offers no protection
against fluctuations in market value that occur with the ups and
downs of interest rates.
   The SEC action comes at a time when enthusiasm is running
especially high for funds investing in government securities.
   As bad as Uncle Sam's own budget problems may be, advisers say,
investors recognize that his promise to pay off on his debts is
still as trustworthy as just about anybody's anywhere.
   This is not necessarily a testimonial to governmental virtue.
Rather, it involves the recognition that the Treasury commands vast
resources.
   Unlike many other borrowers, furthermore, it has the power to
print new money should its hoard ever threaten to run short.
   Donoghue's Moneyletter, an advisory publication on matters of
personal finance, seemed to capture the mood of the moment with a
recent suggestion:
   ``All of our recommended domestic bond funds are either in U.S.
Treasuries or in high-grade corporate bonds.
   ``Our choice of these types of funds was deliberate. Quality is
king.''

<HEAD>As Cold War Ends, So Does a Battler in It for Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The information came by various routes and
methods, often by telephone or courier, from sources in communist
countries to Western European friends who relayed it to the Rev.
Blahoslav Hruby in New York.
   He had developed contacts across Europe before, during and after
World War II in drama-packed experiences that enabled him to alert
Americans to communist repressions throughout the Cold War.
   After its end, the old ``cold warrior,'' a moniker he gamely
bore, died Oct. 22 of congestive heart failure at the age of 78.
   ``One way or another, the documents get to me,'' he once said in
an interview. ``Sometimes I don't know all the details of how, and
don't want to know because it might jeopardize someone. But we get
them.''
   A native Czech, Presbyterian minister and wartime U.S. Army
intelligence captain in the Office of Strategic Services, Hruby for
his last 28 years edited the monthly journal Religion in Communist
Dominated Areas.
   The interreligious-sponsored journal, a prime source to
churches, embassies, U.S. intelligence offices, universities and
other periodicals, kept a steady, revealing watch on religious
abuses under communism.
   ``The churches must help those who are being harassed because of
their faith, and they must tell the truth to the world,'' he said,
often exhorting church conventions to take stronger stands against
Soviet religious persecution.
   His information on arrests, imprisonments and religious
suppression, gathered in smuggled documents and other roundabout
ways, focused early attention on many eventually freed prisoners.
   Only last July, after communist rule ended in Czechoslovakia,
Hruby visited his homeland and met with many dissidents whose
freedom he had worked for.
   One of them, now the country's president, Vaclav Havel, thanked
him, saying: ``You were among the few who paid attention to the
oppressed at a time when it was not at all lucrative.''
   Hruby, who studied theology and philosophy in Czechoslovakia,
Switzerland, France and Germany, was involved as a Protestant
minister in early struggles against Nazism, broadcasting on French
Radio to Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia.
   He escaped from Paris just before the Nazi takeover and aided
fleeing Jewish refugees in Marseille and later in Portugal,
providing them with false baptismal certificates.
   In the United States, he joined the OSS in 1942, and after
assignments in Washington and London, served in Gen. George
Patton's Third Army and was with it when it entered Czechoslovakia
in May 1945.
   After the war and the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, he
returned there as a naturalized American to establish contacts with
people devoted to democracy. Several close friends later were
executed.
   Back in the United States, he served Radio Free Europe as editor
and adviser on religion behind the Iron Curtain, and later was
European director of the American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees in
Munich, Germany.
   In 1962, he launched Religion in Communist Dominated Areas,
initially under auspices of the National Council of Churches, which
includes most major Protestant and Orthodox denominations.
   The council dropped the project in 1971, but the work was
continued under a separat interreligious organization, the
Research Center for Religion and Human Rights in Closed Societies.
   ``I saw so much under Hitler's dictatorship and what happened
under the communists,'' he once related. ``I watched it with my own
eyes.'' He said people must never ``remain silent'' about such
crushing of human rights.
   He sometimes worried that people seemed ``brainwashed by
rhetoric of detente which approves of all Russia's conquests and
oppression.'' He called such appeasing gestures a ``deceptive
fraud.''
   However, he said there always remained ``a spirit of resistance
in the free world - a resistance to the pressures of the communist
bloc not only on religious freedom but on political and national
freedoms.''
   Hruby was regularly attacked in the communist press prior to the
1989 collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. He had been ailing in
recent months and his wife, Olga, also a Czech native, has served
as the journal's co-editor.
   In a brief telephone conversation after communism fell, he said:
   ``It's like the sun coming out. There still will be plenty of
problems after all the years of oppression. But it's a new chance
now to build free societies. We should all thank God.''

   Members of an ecumenical mission to Eastern
Europe reported a ``tremendous upsurge'' in religious affiliation
in Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania.
   The delegation, sponsored by the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation, said more and more people in those countries are
turning to religion for solace and hope in the face of vast
economic and political changes.
   However, the group also reported a growing chauvinism combined
with strong religious and ethnic rivalries that threaten to
heighten tensions and destablize new governments formed since the
end of communist rule.
   Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the interfaith foundation,
which works to promote religious freedom, said that ``at a time of
economic hardship and social upheaval, many East Europeans are
turning to God,'' but some also ``are turning against their
neighbors of a different ethnic, religious or national origin.''
   ---
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - A Gallup poll found that 88 percent of
families who attend religious services weekly contribute to
charity, but of those who don't worship regularly, only 58 percent
contribute to charity.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sociologist Dean Hoge said at a conference on
the Roman Catholic church's future that the shortage of priests
will last ``as long as any of us in the room are alive.''
   ``For us, it's permanent,'' said Hoge of the Catholic University
of America. ``The problem exists in all modern European nations as
well. This is a widespread phenomenon.''
   He said that for every 100 priests who leave active ministry in
this country, only 59 are being ordained.

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - Thousands of United Methodist clergy

   ST. LOUIS (AP) - A federal appeals court has upheld a lower
court ruling that classes on the Bible provided by the Gravette,
Ark., elementary school are unconstitutional.
   The rural school district, which had offered the voluntary
classes for 51 years, recently moved them off campus. District
officials contended Bible classes are part of a well-rounded
education and were popular in the community.
   George Oleson, a Fayetteville, Ark., lawyer for the plaintiff,
said it was irrelevant that most people favored the classes. ``Even
if there is one dissenter, he is protected under the First
Amendment rights.''
   Oleson also argued that information from the Bible should not be
presented because ``children perceive what they are told by adults
to be facts. They aren't rational thinkers at that age.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Wilford V. Bane Jr., a longtime United

   CHICAGO (AP) - The Conservative Baptist Association of America
and the Salvation Army have been accepted into membership of the
National Association of Evangelicals.
   That brings the association's membership to 48 denominations
with a combined 4.6 million members.
   The Rev. Billy A. Melvin, executive director of the association,
said the joining of ``two distinct but rich heritages and
expressions of the Christian faith ... will contribute signficantly
to the ministry and vision of NAE.''
   The organization represents a conservative, evangelical
counterpart to the National Council of Churches, whose older, more
inclusive and mostly larger denominations have a combined
membership of 42 million.

<HEAD>Homebrew Craze: For Some, the Best Beer is Made in the Kitchen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Outlaws had made a sizeable dent in the
evening's beer supply by the time Charlie Papazian rose to deliver
the invocation. He raised a glass of frothy ale, grinned through
his beard and led the crowd in the familiar chant:
   ``RELAX! DON'T WORRY! HAVE A HOMEBREW!''
   Up went a hundred glasses and down went the beer.
   Down went Sal Pennacchio's BME Porter, a rich, black ale with a
toasty aroma, and down went John Quinn's Spiced Brown Ale, redolent
of chocolate and cinnamon. Down went a nutty German-style ale and a
malty, golden Pilsener, and down went several other brews that will
never be found at your neighborhood tavern.
   The beers were the star attraction at the annual dinner of the
Outlaws of Homebrew, one of a growing number of clubs around the
nation devoted to home beer brewing. The dinner (the food was
bratwurst and sauerkraut) drew more than 100 people to Brooklyn
Brewery's distribution warehouse on a dark industrial block in
Brooklyn.
   It's estimated that somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million
people in the United States brew their own beer. Homebrewing has
been legal since 1978, and by all accounts is in the midst of a
heady spurt of growth.
   ``I think people are paying more attention to what they're
putting down their mouths,'' said Papazian, whose book, ``The
Complete Joy of Homebrewing,'' is the hobby's bible.
   Membership in the American Homebrewers Association, which
Papazian founded in 1978, is up 41 percent in the past year and is
expected to top 10,000 by year's end. There are at least 150
homebrew clubs in the country and 1,200 retail supply shops.
   ``It's growing tremendously,'' said Seth Schneider, the general
manager of Crosby &amp; Baker, a brewing supply manufacturer and
distributor in Westport, Mass. ``We're still on the steep part of a
growth curve.''
   The growth in homebrewing has mirrored the development of
microbreweries - small breweries that typically devote themselves
to full-bodied, high-quality beers. These beers account for a
microscopic .15 percent of the national market, but loom large in
the world of homebrewers.
   There is a strong symbiotic relationship between homebrewers and
microbrewers. Homebrewers are microbrewers' most loyal customers;
microbrewers frequently sponsor the homebrewers' organizations and
events.
   The Outlaws of Homebrew dinner, for instance, was sponsored by
Brooklyn Brewery, which provided the warehouse and two varieties of
its own beer. Company founder Steve Hindy is himself a homebrewer
who likes to tinker with recipes in his kitchen before trying them
out in the brewery.
   ``Actually, right now I'm brewing something I call a chocolate
stout at home,'' he said.
   The attractions of homebrewing are several. Foremost is the
ability to make good beer; quality has improved mightily in the
past decade as homebrew suppliers have become increasingly
sophisticated.
   ``A homebrew rivals the best beer you've ever had,'' said
Schneider. ``It hasn't traveled, it has more body, it hasn't been
filtered ... and you can make it exactly to your taste.''
   Some of those tastes are exotic - some would say bizarre.
Homebrewers have been known to toss all manner of ingredients into
their brew. Spruce beer, cherry beer and ginger beer are among the
more common of the strange brews.
   Sal Pennacchio, treasurer of the Outlaws of Homebrew, recalls
what happened last November when his wife was about to toss out the
Halloween pumpkin. The result was is Pumpkin Ale, which won third
prize in a national homebrew competition; it tasted, he said,
``just like pumpkin pie.''
   ``I think that's the great thing about homebrewing,'' Pennacchio
said. ``With a little experience, you can create anything you
want.''
   Not everyone wants a Pumpkin Ale, of course, but a more
run-of-the-mill brew is a simple thing to make. Beer essentially
consists of malted barley, yeast, hops and water. With those
ingredients and a few rudimentary pieces of equipment - a bucket,
some plastic tubing, a siphon, an air-lock valve, a capping tool
and caps and bottles - anyone can make beer in their kitchen.
   Equipment for a novice costs about $45. Ingredients for two
cases of beer run about $15, or roughly 35 cents a bottle. But that
can vary widely depending on the kind of beer being made.
   A survey a few years ago by the American Homebrewers Association
found that the overwhelming majority of homebrewers were white
males, somewhat to the chagrin of those who champion the hobby.
Brewers also tend to be married, well educated and divided almost
evenly among cities, suburbs and small towns.
   ``The glibbest generalization,'' said Schneider, ``would be
adult males with facial hair.''
   Beyond that, he said, he's noticed that homebrewers are
frequently computer buffs. Indeed, one of the busiest meeting
places for homebrewers is on CompuServe Information Service's beer
``forum'' - a sort of electronic saloon for personal computer
owners.
   The fact is, brewers are a gregarious lot. They are in their
element at an event like the Outlaws dinner, drinking beer and
swapping brewing notes with abandon.
   ``We're out for a good time,'' said Pennacchio, ``and to have
good beer.''

<TEXT>
   In this glamorous tax haven, money's playground by
the sea, the idle rich are making room for the busy, bustling rich.
   Aristocrats still risk fortunes at the Casino's velvet-covered
tables, but the 380-acre principality is catering to a new breed of
wealth and power.
   It seeks the working rich who may spend a week in Monaco, not
six months like the grand dukes of a century ago, to check on an
industrial investment, watch the Grand Prix or attend a business
convention.
   On a stroll through the Casino gardens, you're more likely to
meet carpet salesmen from Toronto than European royalty. Last year,
Monaco welcomed 50,000 convention-goers.
   Tourism now generates only one-fourth of the $5 billion gross
national product. Gambling, once the government's mainstay, brings
in only 4 percent.
   Banking accounts for 35 percent and light industry 27. Monaco
now has 50 banks, and more are coming.
   Prince Rainier, who has ruled since 1949, sought to preserve and
capitalize on Monaco's reputation for glamor when he called for
economic diversification.
   ``The government has put its money behind prestige and luxury,''
said a public relations officer for the principality. ``It used to
bank on the very rich. Today it has sought to develop a clientele
of the slightly less rich.''
   Hotel statistics are revealing. Monaco has 2,400 rooms, 80
percent in the luxury category going for $200 to $450. Fewer than
100 rooms cost less than $50.
   Officials try to keep industry and tourism apart. Hardly any of
the 3 million daytrippers who spilled from trains and buses last
year went near the industrial park on Fontvieille, a peninsula
reclaimed from the sea.
   Many of the Monaco's 700 industrial companies are there. Most
are in such high-tech, non-polluting fields as pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and engineering.
   A value added tax on the new commercial activities is the
largest source of revenue in Monaco's annual budget of $510
million.
   Fontvieille accommodates both factories and company
headquarters, stacked atop each other in skyscrapers. Nearby are a
new sports stadium, three-star hotel, heliport and Monaco's only
low-income housing.
   It was the brainchild of Prince Rainier, who saw the future of
his tiny realm in real estate. A forest of skyscrapers, eyesores to
many visitors, looms against a background of steep mountains,
dwarfing hillside villas built in the 19th century.
   Commercial or residential space in Monaco generally is more
expensive than in Paris and New York. A two-room apartment in
Fontvieille rents for $3,000 a month, and cheaper accommodations
are hard to find.
   Housing has become a major headache. The government gives
priority for state-owned housing and rent subsidies of up to 50
percent to the natives, called Monegasques, but demand exceeds
supply.
   Many apartments are owned by investors who spend little time in
them. At night, dark windows make patches on luxury high-rises.
   Nightlife revolves around a few expensive discotheques and
clubs, and cultural events geared to the wealthy establishment.
   Young residents complain of little to do. Monaco has only one
movie theater, no discount or department stores, no major shopping
center.
   There is virtually no unemployment, yet Monegasques - about
4,500 in a population of 27,000 - worry about the future.
   ``The problem is not finding jobs for young Monegasques, it's
finding jobs suited to their educational degrees and
qualifications,'' said Stephane Valeri, 28.
   He heads the Association of Young Monegasques, founded in 1986
to handle their employment and housing problems and help them start
businesses. Citizens now own less than 3 percent of commerce and
industry in Monaco, but Valeri said new opportunities were opening
in services and the law.
   ``We're very attached to our history, our traditions and to the
royal family,'' he said. ``We're just trying to make Monaco better
for the year 2000.''
   In addition to the myth that all ar rich, which the government
tries to dispel, Monegasques have a reputation as poor workers.
   ``Some Monegasques ... adopt a superior attitude and feel they
can get away with anything because they know they can't be fired,''
a government spokesperson said, on condition of anonymity.
   The 5,000 Italians who cross the border each day to work in
hotels and restaurants envy the privileges of Monegasques,
including comprehensive health insurance, higher wages and the
first crack at vacant jobs.
   Residents of this fiscal paradise, except for French nationals
who have arrived since 1957, pay no taxes on income, capital gains
or on an inheritance if it comes directly from a parent or spouse.
   Security and respectability are basic tenets. The police force
has 400 members, who help tourists, direct traffic and discourage
purse-snatching and other crimes.
   ``Monaco is the type of place where you think twice about
dropping candy wrappers,'' said a retired Greek executive who has
lived here 35 years. ``You feel very safe and life is very calm.''
   A dress code confines bathing suits to the beach and forbids
going barefoot. Shorts are permitted, but men are not allowed to go
bare chested. Expulsion from Monaco is the punishment for
violations.
   Officials know the future depends on physical expansion. Besides
putting the train station underground, architects unveiled plans
last year for three floating islands with their own stores and
homes, connected to the mainland by bridges and ferries.
   ``It sounds like ... Jules Verne, but it's something I'm sure my
successors will have to deal with,'' said Jean-Louis Medecin, the
mayor.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Truth has been critically wounded,
at the very least, by partisan journalism that inflames the bitter
ethnic rivalries of this patchwork nation.
   Yugoslavia's freewheeling press, once the most open of Eastern
Europe, has become increasingly provincial, entangled in local
conflicts.
   The trend is evident in all six Yugoslav republics, but the
state-run press and television of Serbia seem to lead in the way.
   Headlines scream ``Hellish Police Hunt on Serbs'' over accounts
of routine investigations in Croatia. An article on federal reforms
aimed at creating a market economy is introduced with: ``Serbian
Economy Knifed in Back.''
   Accusations flying between Communist-ruled Serbia, the largest
republic, and the freely elected governments of Slovenia and
Croatia have created such animosity that Yugoslavia may not
survive.
   Serbs and Croats, the largest ethnic groups in this nation of 24
million, have been rivals since 1918, when the country was born as
the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was reconstituted as
a communist republic in 1945.
   Political and economic differences accentuate the ethnic
divisions in a power struggle that began with the death in 1980 of
Josip Tito, who founded the postwar nation and held it together.
   Croatia and Slovenia want Yugoslavia to be a loose confederation
of sovereign states. Serbia insists on a ``modern federation'' with
power still centralized in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal
capital.
   Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's populist leader, says he will
enlarge the republic to take in Serbs from other regions if the
federation disintegrates.
   When Croatian police tried to recover hundreds of guns stolen
from government armories by local Serbs, banner headlines in Serbia
said: ``Croatian Police Throw Serbian Infants Around'' and
``Fascist Terrorists Sent to Subjugate Serbs.''
   Stories below the headlines in the dailies Politika and Politika
Ekspres did not support the allegations. They quoted
``well-informed sources,'' unnamed and not described, echoing
Serbian claims that Croatian police recruited ``fascist
terrorists'' to harass the 500,000 Serbs in Croatia.
   ``Poison seeps from the pages of Politika in all directions,''
said Croatian writer Slavko Mihalic. ``Everybody is denounced for
one thing or another, and that includes any Serbs who dare oppose
Milosevic.''
   Media in Slovenia and Croatia have accused Milosevic repeatedly
of fomenting ethnic turmoil.
   In the Croatian parliamewnt, deputy Stjepan Mesic waved a copy
of Politika and declared: ``Milosevic is guilty of stirring up the
trouble in Croatia.''
   Belgrade television reported ``all-out civil war'' between Serbs
and Croats in Croatia, although no one had been killed or seriously
injured.
   To tighten the gripon Serbian media, Milosevic and his
Communist supporters have fired or demoted hundreds of
independent-minded journalists.
   After the latest round of 20 demotions, the daily Vjesnik in
Zagreb, capital of Croatia, accused Serbs of ``pushing their
hard-line concepts to the brink of intercommunal violence to avoid
holding free elections.'' Serbia has scheduled elections for Dec.
9.
   ``Civil war may be the last refuge for hard-line Communists,''
Vjesnik declared.
   Calls for fairness by opposition parties and independent
journalists are ignored by Serbian television and the
once-respected Politika.
   In June, police with clubs broke up a demonstration against
biased coverage, beating several intellectuals and opposition
leaders.
   Television did not show what happened and said protesters
attacked the police. A television newscast in Croatia that included
footage of the violence was not broadcast in Belgrade.
   ``Two-thirds of what the Belgrade media say is lies,'' said Vuk
Draskovic, head of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, which
threatens to boycott the December elections unless unbiased
coverage is guaranteed.
   Serbian television, nicknamed ``Milosevision'' in Belgrade,
agreed to carry brief opposition statements. It insisted all 39
registered groups have equal time, however, even though only three
have significant followings.
   Serbian television, nicknamed ``Milosevision'' by residents of
Belgrade, carries short campaign speeches by opposition leaders
only on its third channel, seen in just one-sixth of the republic.
   Ante Markovic, the federal premier, is popular with Yugoslavs
generally, but not with Milosevic, who objects to his
market-oriented economic reforms and attempts to form a national
political party.
   Markovic has described in the press as an ``enemy of the Serbian
people out to plunder our republic.''
   In an effort to counter such treatment, the premier announced a
weekly federal television program to present fair coverage of
national issues. TV Belgrade refused to cooperate, effectively
keeping the one-hour program off the air in Serbia.
   Serbian media make their most abusive attacks on the ethnic
Albanian majority in the republic's southern province, Kosovo.
   Albanians in Kosovo have demonstrated regularly against
Milosevic's abolition of self-rule in the province, and Serbian
police have killed at least 60 in the past 18 months.
   The Serbian press portrays the demonstrators as ``terrorists''
who attack security forces with ``heavy machine guns and mortars.''
No Serbs have been killed or seriously hurt.
   International human rights groups that condemn the repression
are ``sworn enemies of the Serbs'' and members of the U.S. Congress
who visited Kosovo were ``mercenaries in the pay of the Albanian
lobby,'' the Belgrade papers say.

<TEXT>
   In its 25th year, the brawny Ford Bronco continues to be the
leader in the full-size utility vehicle segment.
   Bronco sales may have fallen 13 percent in the 1990 model year,
but Ford still sold 54,505 of the hardy trucks. Sales for the
category as a whole, meanwhile, dropped 20 percent.
   Introduced in August 1965 as a 1966 model, the Bronco won early
raves for its mix of car and truck attributes and its ability to
offer both utility and personal transportation. Its biggest year
was 1978, when 82,343 Broncos were sold. In the 1980s, Ford began
producing a smaller version, the Bronco II, which Ford replaced
with the 1991 Explorer.
   The test vehicle, a 1991 Silver Anniversary Bronco, carries on
the tradition of the original.
   The lowest part of the door opening was at my knee level. There
was no handle to help me climb up and inside, so I had to grip the
steering wheel and hoist myself in. It wasn't graceful; it was a
challenge.
   The engine was a gas-hogging, 5.8-liter V8 that got about 13
miles per gallon in mixed city-highway driving. Coupled with a
four-speed automatic transmission, it produced 200 horsepower.
   The Bronco operated in both two-wheel and four-wheel drive. I
just pushed a button on the dash to go from one to the other, since
the front wheels had automatic locking hubs. Four-wheel drive
allowed me to climb over everything, though the off-road ride was
quite bouncy as I hit rocks and potholes.
   Two-wheel drive also offered a rather mushy ride, and it took
some planning to make turns without going over curbs and hitting
tree limbs. The Bronco's rear antilock brakes worked wonderfully,
keeping the large rear end from swaying out of control in sudden
stops.
   Inside, there was plenty of room for anyone to stretch out in
the two front bucket seats. A huge, deep storage box - in addition
to a regular glovebox on the dashboard - was located between the
seats and kept front-seat passengers a good distance apart.
   Letters and numbers on dashboard gauges were large and easy to
read. But I did have a problem finding the power window and door
lock buttons at night. The buttons were on the lower half of the
doors but they were not lit.
   The Bronco's front seats leaned forward to allow passengers to
climb up and into the rear seat area. The door openings were wide,
allowing good access, but I had to give the front seatbacks a
really good shove to return them to their locked position.
   The rear bench seat was cushioned and comfortable for two adults
but might be a bit confining for three good-sized adults, since the
seat is squeezed between the vehicle's two wheel wells.
   The rear cargo area behind the seat was spacious and nicely
carpeted, and you could fold up and take out the rear seat for even
more storage area. But watch the tailgate. It's big and heavy and
requires both hands for a smaller person to handle.
   Fit and finish on the test truck was good, save for some grease
that oozed up from where the transmission shifter attached to the
steering column.
   Bronco buyers are predominantly men - 82.2 percent - and married
- 73.4 percent. Ford spokesman Woody Haines said California has the
highest Bronco usage, followed by Illinois, Michigan, Florida, New
Jersey and Texas.
   Most Bronco buyers have annual household income of between
$30,000 and $45,000. Nearly a third have some college education,
and 13.3 percent are in managerial jobs, Haines said.
   He added that the major competitor is the Chevrolet Suburban,
which starts at more than $15,600 for a base model. The test 25th
anniversary Bronco had a base price of $24,866, but the
lowest-priced Bronco starts at $18,195, according to Haines.
   Consumer Reports magazine ranked the 1988 Bronco average in
owner reports of trouble.

   To Cable News Network, Turner Network
Television and Headline News, media mogul Ted Turner has added yet
another building block atop his TV empire.
   You can find in the supermarket checkout line.
   No, it's not TV Guide. But it is near the National Enquirer.
   You know how it is. You're stuck behind someone with an
overburdened cart, waiting patiently to purchase your piddling pile
of groceries. They're writing a check. You've got cash.
   What to do?
   Watch television.
   In 13 stores across the country, the Atlanta-based Turner
Broadcasting System and Connecticut-based ActMedia have just
completed an unprecedented, six-week test in which TV monitors were
installed in every checkout line.
   It provides the latest example of how far Turner will go in
attempting to create his own global village. It also represents a
new marketing tool brilliant in its simplicity:
   What better way to sell something than to flash it before the
eyes of a captive consumer audience?
   ``Some of the networks hemmed and hawed,'' said Wayne LoCurto,
president and chief executive officer of ActMedia. ``Turner went
bonkers.''
   Pushing products on people going nowhere in a hurry is nothing
new. Efforts are underway to pipe television and advertising into
doctors' waiting rooms.
   But Turner and ActMedia are the first to beam live television
into grocery stores.
   The Checkout Channel, as they call it, works like this:
   TV monitors with built-in sound sensors blink on whenever
someone stands in line. On the tube are eight-minute segments
culled from CNN's Headline News. Each segment contains two minutes
of commercials. During the daytime, the spots are tailored to
women. In the evenings, they are geared to working couples and
singles. On the weekend, they are family oriented.
   ``One of Ted's missions is to have CNN available everywhere, all
the time,'' said Scott Weiss, vice president of special products
for TBS. ``We have a division that has licensed CNN for use in
hotels and airlines.''
   Rest easy. To date, there are no plans to pipe the 24-hour news
channel into public restrooms.
   But no place, it seems, is forever safe from the intrusion of
the boob tube and attempts to make bigger advertising bucks.
   ``We are exploring every opportunity where you might find
yourself standing in line with nothing to do,'' Weiss said.
   The concept for the Checkout Channel originated at ActMedia,
LoCurto said, and was offered to the major networks. Only Turner,
however, was ready to put up money immediately.
   At a cost of $75 million, ActMedia, one of the country's largest
in-store advertising firms, installs the hardware. TBS, at a cost
it won't disclose, provides the programming.
   To do so, Turner assembled a new department of about 30 editors,
writers and producers to furnish the 24-hour channel with its
eight-minute (the average wait in the checkout line) segments via
satellite.
   Each installment is updated as news events dictate and the
channel can go live with major breaking stories.
   The test period ended two days before Halloween. For the next
few months, Turner and ActMedia will review the channel's
performance, confer with advertisers and store managers and try to
make sure all are happy.
   If ActMedia's revenue projections prove true, everyone should
be.
   The advertising firm has estimated that the channel will bring
in $100 million annually by 1993.
   ActMedia plans to equip 275 stores a month beginning next
spring, resulting in 5,000 stores with television monitors by 1992.
That means 60 million people each week will be watching.
   ``There is substantial cost to program a network of this
nature,'' Weiss said. ``But this is really the wave of the future.
You're going to see television everywhere you go.''
   According to Weiss and LoCurto, the reception has been
overwhelmingly positive.
   ``The only negative response came from people thinking that this
was going to increase the costs of their groceries,'' LoCurto said.
``Once we explained that we were paying for it, the response was
terrific.''
   Not one of the 13 test markets, which represented more than half
of the nation's top supermarket chains, asked that the monitors be
removed, LoCurto said.
   The financial payoff for the stores comes from a split of the
advertising profits with ActMedia. For Turner, the benefit comes in
getting two free commercial segments in each eight-minute
installment and the opportunity to expose CNN to a greater number
of people than its current 50 million subscribers.
   At the A&amp;P in Atlanta, shoppers loved the Checkout Channel.
   ``We're doing excellent,'' said assistant store manager Mike
Jackson. ``It pacifies people in the lines, especially on our
busiest days.''
   LoCurto insists that the Checkout Channel's advertising is not
intended to encourage impulse buying. Foods such as Campbell's
soups are advertised next to non-edible products such as Ford
Escorts and Florida's Walt Disney World.
   ``We look at it as another (television) network,'' LoCurto said.
``It's another way to expose all kinds of products.''
   But Jackson at the A&amp;P said he saw a lot of shoppers leave the
checkout line to pick up things that caught their eye on the TV.
The flickering monitor also reminded people of things they had
forgotten to put on their grocery lists, Jackson said.
   Weren't some customers annoyed by the new machinery? Weren't the
checkers distracted by the noise?
   ``Naw, the girls up at the registers didn't mind it one bit,''
Jackson said. ``I did have one complaint, though. Some guys wanted
to know why we couldn't keep it tuned to a certain football game so
they could sit there and watch it.''
   Is every potentially boring circumstance now open to television?
Is nothing sacred to television's cable czar?
   Well, Weiss replied laughing, they did think about churches. ``I
don't think they would have let us in,'' he said, ``but I bet
somebody would watch it.''

   Four months ago, The Associated Press first
reported evidence of an ``Unofficial Recession'' in many parts of
the country. While statistics have yet to qualify the downturn as a
full-blown recession, American belts continue to tighten. Below, in
a follow-up to a July series, the AP explores the mounting human
toll.

   When business was booming, carpenter Tony Gonzalez stood atop
his world, Chicago's gleaming new high-rises. Now he's back to
earth, remodeling an occasional kitchen or adding a room.
   Medical-equipment salesman Brian Dillon makes fewer trips
through his Rocky Mountain territory since higher gasoline prices
nearly doubled travel costs. In Florida, new mother Myra DeLessio
put off buying a dining room set, clips discount coupons more often
and watches for sales.
   Growing numbers of middle-class Americans, jolted by job
insecurity and other forces beyond their control, have been
retrenching and rethinking in preparation for what some experts
believe will be a long economic winter.
   Government figures released this past week show the nation is
still enjoying the longest economic expansion in peacetime history,
but many private economists say that information masks the truth.
They point to rising unemployment, falling home sales and the grim
Christmas foreseen by storekeepers.
   On a historical scale, the suffering is relative. Bread lines
aren't forming, but average people are definitely feeling a pinch.
In the fading glow of the high-flying 1980s, cutbacks at home,
office and factory have the look and feel of bad times.
   Matters seem to have worsened just in recent weeks. Part of it
is due to higher energy prices from the Persian Gulf crisis, which
has made many Americans more careful with their money. Others fret
about paying more taxes as a result of the long-delayed federal
budget agreement.
   ``We think we're in a recession and the recession began some
time in the summer,'' said David H. Resler, chief economist for
Nomura Securities Inc. in New York.
   Albert Sindlinger, a veteran forecaster whose Wallingford, Pa.,
firm tracks household-spending trends as a measure of the economy's
health, is even more convinced. He says the recession began in
January.
   Part of the debate about whether the country is in a recession
stems from the enormous size of the U.S. economy, which by some
analyses is a hodgepodge of economies that don't behave the same
way. While factories in Seattle work overtime, Wall Street fades;
while Silicon Valley prospers and Dallas rebounds, Philadelphia and
Detroit struggle.
   ``I'm not sure the word (recession) fits any more. The country
is not one,'' said Jay Goldinger of Capital Insight Inc., a Beverly
Hills, Calif., financial consulting company. ``Consumers and
investors in the West for the most part still have a positive
outlook.''
   But for people like Gonzalez, the Chicago carpenter; Dillon, the
Denver salesman; or Mrs. DeLessio, the new mom from Jacksonville,
Fla., economic semantics aren't important.
   ``People aren't coming in and saying, `I'm in a recession.'
They're saying, `I'm really worried about our finances and feel
we're not doing as well as we ought to be doing,''' said Victoria
Felton-Collins, a financial planner and psychologist with offices
in California. ``The psychology has such a greater effect than the
actual (economic) indicators.''
   Donald L. Badders, president of the National Foundation for
Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, Md., said the number of families
seeking advice from the foundation's 500-office network has risen
noticeably in the past month alone.
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. executives report that in recent months
about 50 percent more companies have asked them to hold financial
planning seminars for employees, current and laid off, partly due
to the tenuous economic picture.
   Badders said his counselors are seeing more people from
layoff-plagued financial services and banking companies in the
Northeast. Elsewhere, others have complained of a drop in income
due to cutbacks in hours or the loss of a spouse's part-time job.
   ``What they need is some general help in figuring out how to get
by on the income they have,'' Badders said.
   Sindlinger's latest ``household liquidity'' survey shows more
families are reporting less cash on hand after bills are paid. As
of late October, more than half those polled in 38 states reported
less liquidity and felt they were in a recession. In July it was 28
states.
   ``For the last three or four months, eight out of 10
(households) are telling us income is down because their fixed
costs are up - insurance, medical cotate taxes,''
Sindlinger said.
   ``And what does the federalsts, local and s government do? It raises
taxes.
We're setting ourselves up for a depression that is parallel to the
1930s. I know; I've lived through it,' said the 83-year-old
forecaster whose business was started with help from President
Herbert Hoover.
   So far, there appear to be few changes in Americans' bill-paying
patterns. Delinquencies of outstanding installment loans, such as
credit cards and auto loans, have held steady over the past few
months at around 2.5 percent, saysov. 4

   Tough times call for tough measures in household financial
planning. Here are some basic suggestions from a few of the
experts:
   -Draw up a budget, listing all monthly income and expenses.
Stick with it.
   -Put aside emergency cash to cover anywhere from three months'
to a year's expenses. The amount will depend partly on factors like
job security. Job counseling centers say it takes an out-of-work
person at least a month to find another job for each $10,000 he or
she might have been been earning.
   -Keep emergencymoney in a safe, easily accessible account like
a money market fund, short-term certificates of deposit or Treasury
bills.
   -Should a layoff occur review all options concerning severance
pay. An average worker receives a week's pay for each year employed
at a company, either in a lump sum or periodic payments.
   Whether you receive it all at once or over time depends on when
a layoff occurs and the company's financial health. If it's just
before year end, it might be better to take the money in separate
payments because severance is taxable in the year it's received.
   If the employer is shaky, it could be best to take the lump sum,
says Steve Weinstein, tax manager for the Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
accounting firm. But he says that option can terminate any
obligation of the employer to continue paying benefits such as
health insurance.
   -Review all borrowing options. Can you get an interest-free loan
from a relative? A home-equity line of credit? You can ``borrow''
from your Individual Retirement Account without penalty provided
you return the money within 60 days, says Weinstein. But it's wise
to avoid credit card cash advances, which usually carry hefty rates
of interest, some near 20 percent.
   -Lower debt. It may be more beneficial to reduce your
outstanding credit card balance than keep money in a 6 percent
savings account.
   -Get help if you can't pay your bills. The nonprofit National
Foundation for Consumer Credit will work out a payback plan with
your creditors for a nominal fee, and in some cases, free of
charge. It has 500 offices throughout the country. Call
1-800-388-CCCS to find one close to you.
   -Be honest with your creditors. In many cases, if you're a month
or two behind in your mortgage payments, the mortgage holder will
try to work out some type of temporary, revised payment plan.
   ``There's no way lenders can help any if you don't communicate
with them,'' said Ronnie J. Wynn, president of the Mortgage Bankers
Association.
   -Review your investment mix and goals. Set some money aside - no
matter how little - for things like your children's college
education, home improvements, or retirement.
   ``You can't do effective asset building as an afterthought,''
says Weinstein.

<HEAD>Slumping Economy is Key Election Issue in Recession-Struck
Northeast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Northeastern voters prepare to go to the polls
on Tuesday, their mood can best be described as anger - at an
enveloping recession, at record taxes and billion-dollar budget
deficits, and at incumbents.
   ``The three biggest issues are the economy, the economy and the
economy,'' said Thomas Ferguson, a political science professor at
the University of Massachusetts at Boston. ``You're looking at
declining real estate values. And you've got a lot of people losing
their jobs.''
   In Massachusetts and in three Maryland counties, residents will
vote on tax-busting referendums. Incumbents in some hard-hit states
are running for their political lives - and some quit rather than
face the voters' wrath.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts rode his state's
prosperity to the Democratic presidential nomination. But when he
lost, and Massachusetts went into a tailspin, he raised taxes and
said he would not run for re-election.
   Democratic Govs. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut and Madeleine
Kunin of Vermont also raised taxes and bowed out of the primaries.
   Still, Republican candidates seized on their unpopularity,
accusing them of budget mismanagement and big spending. Their
Democratic replacements tried to disassociate themselves from the
incumbents they dubbed as political insiders.
   Two incumbent Republican governors, John R. McKernan of Maine
and Edward D. DiPrete of Rhode Island, ran for re-election and
faced tough challenges. The ramaining four incumbent governors who
are up for re-election seem safe.
   Govs. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and Willaim D. Schaefer of
Maryland, both Democrats, held the line on taxes and both states
declared budget surpluses for the fiscal year ended June 30. New
Hampshire has no income or general sales tax and Republican Gov.
Judd Gregg opposed both.
   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York appears assured of
winning a third, four-year term despite a record $1.8 billion tax
increase; a state credit rating that is the third worst in the
nation; and a recent poll that found that 56 percent believed New
York was headed in the wrong direction.
   He faces a weak, campaign-bungling opponent, Pierre Rinfret, an
economist and political novice who was chosen when no more
prominent politician agreed to run. And Cuomo has been able to stay
in front of the issues.
   ``He anticipated the economic downturn and began to address it
last January, talking about how the problems in New York were of a
national scope starting from Washington,'' said Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``He was able to deflect a lot of tension
otherwise laid at his doorstep by talking about national political
leadership.''
   The only question is whether Cuomo can reach or top his record
65 percent of the vote he received in 1986, a boost for a possible
run for the presidency. The tightest races appear to be in
Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island.
   In Massachusetts, Democrat John Silber, on leave as president of
Boston University, and Republican William Weld, a former assistant
U.S. attorney general, both cmpaigned as outsiders who would
return the state's economy to good health. Both defeated their
party's endorsed candidate in the primary.
   Silber opposes ``Question 3,'' a referendum that would roll back
taxes and some fees to their 1988 level. Weld supports it.
   Backers say Massachusetts residents already pay the sixth
highest taxes in the country and that during the last seven years
the Dukakis Administration has increased spending from nearly $7
billion to more than $13 billion.
   If the referendum is approved, opponents say, it would roll back
$1 billion already collected and spent and cost Massachusetts $6
billion over three years, forcing cutbacks in education, programs
for the elderly and other services.
   Referendums in Montgomery, Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties
in Maryland would limit annual increases in property taxes to as
low as 2 percent a year or would peg them to the previous year's
inflation rate. Montgomery County, one of the wealthiest in the
nation, is a suburb of Washington.
   In Maine, U.S. Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, a Democrat, is trying to
unseat the Republican incumbent McKernan. Brennan charged that
McKernan failed to move quickly enough to counter the faltering
economy. Brennan served two four-year terms as governor before
changing offices with McKernan in 1987.
   Rhode Island's DiPrete is in danger of losing the governor's
office to Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun, a millionaire businessman who
is trying to unseat him for the third time. DiPrete reversed
himself on a pledge of no new taxes.
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., former three-term Republican U.S. senator
who is running as an independent for the Connecticut governor's
seat, is favored to break the Democratic Party's two-decade hold on
the office.
   In Vermont, Republican Richard Snelling, Gov. Kunin's
predecessor, is the favorite to succeed her.
   The only major races in New Jersey and Delaware are for the U.S.
Senate. The Democratic incumbents, Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
often mentioned as a presidential candidate, and Joseph R. Biden
Jr. of Delaware, are expected to win re-election by wide margins.

<HEAD>A Decade of Republican Advances Could Turn in the South and
Southwest</HEAD>

   After a decade of gains in the traditionally
Democratic South and Southwest, Republicans are in danger of losing
some of their most prized possessions Tuesday, including four
governorships and conservative flag-carrier Jesse Helms' U.S.
Senate seat.
   Texas and Alabama have had only one Republican governor since
Reconstruction; Florida and Oklahoma only two. Yet the GOP is
embroiled in neck-and-neck, if not cutthroat, races to retain those
offices.
   Add in Helms, who some polls show trailing Harvey Gantt, the
first black North Carolinian to win his party's nomination for the
U.S. Senate, and Tuesday could yield a southern shift back to the
Democrats.
   ``If the Democrats are able to win, then what had been very
steady Republican gains over the last 10 years may be held in
check, and that's a very dramatic thing,'' said Bob Joffee of
Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, a non-partisan polling firm.
   In Florida and Alabama, incumbent Republican governors Bob
Martinez and Guy Hunt are running no better than even in some
polls. Martinez trailed former Sen. Lawton Chiles early on, and
Hunt, the first Republican governor in Alabama since 1874, appears
to have lost an early lead to Democrat Paul Hubbert, who built the
state teachers' union into a powerful political lobby.
   In Texas and Oklahoma, states with retiring Republican
governors, the races have been particularly nasty. Texas Republican
businessman Clayton Williams appears to have lost his lead after
refusing to shake hands with Democrat state Treasurer Ann Richards.
   Oklahoma Democrat David Walters is slugging out a political
brawl with Republican Bill Price. Walters has accused Price of
oil-price gouging. Price denied that allegation and filed a libel
suit against Walters.
   In Georgia, the Democrats appear likely to retain the governor's
mansion, with Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, who beat out Andrew Young in
the primary, favored over state House GOP leader Johnny Isakson.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton is expected to have a easy win over
Republican challenger Sheffield Nelson, a former natural gas
company executive, as is South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, who
faces black state Sen. Theo Mitchell. Mitchell's campaign has been
in disarray and Campbell, who is white, has picked up endorsements
from blacks.
   In Senate races, four Democratic incumbents in the region are
favored for easy re-election victories. Alabama's Howell Heflin
faces Republican state Sen. Bill Cabaniss, Oklahoma's David Boren
has a commanding lead over the GOP's Stephen Jones, Tennessee's Al
Gore meets Republican economist William Hawkins, and West
Virginia's John Rockefeller is heavily favored over Republican
attorney John Yoder.
   Two Republicans in the Senate are also expected to win
re-election easily. Kentucky's Mitch McConnell is being challenged
by Judge Harvey Sloane and Texas' Phil Gramm faces Democratic state
Sen. Hugh Parmer.
   Four senators are running unopposed: Arkansas' David Pryor,
Georgia's Sam Nunn, Mississippi's Thad Cochran, South Carolina's
Strom Thurmond and Virginia's Sen. John Warner. Arkansas' David
Pryor faces only write-in opposition.
   Helms has been low-key through his campaign, keeping public
appearances to a minimum and holding back on the ``attack''
television ads that have been his trademark. The three-term
Republican told reporters at one point he was ``trying to be
restrained.''
   ``I just wonder whether there's something about having Harvey
Gantt running that may be causing them problems,'' said Thad Beyle,
a political science professor at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill.
   Polls show Helms and Gantt virtually deadlocked at about 45
percent of the vote each, with about 10 percent undecided. That's
standard for a Helms race, experts say. Some slippage in a black
candidate's support could be expected when voters actually go to
the polls, they add.
   Ethics has been the issue at which candidates have hammered
away, especially in Texas and Florida.
   Chiles, who retired at the end of his third U.S. Senate term in
January 1989 as one of Florida's most respected politicians, has
waged an attack on big-money politics, and has imposed a $100 limit
on contributions. He has raised $4 million, against Martinez' $10.2
million.
   In Texas, Ms. Richards, best-known nationally for her biting
keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, has
accused Williams of financial misdeeds with his companies. Williams
has raised Ms. Richards past abuse of alcohol, and questioned
whether she used drugs.
   Blacks in the South will add to gains in the region following
Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder's election. Louisiana will elect its
first black congressman since Reconstruction. Two black Democratic
lawyers are campaigning for retiring Louisiana Rep. Lindy Boggs'
seat, the only black majority district now represented by a white.
Marc Morial, son of the late New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial, faces
state Sen. William Jefferson.
   In the nation's capital, residents will elect a new mayor to
succeed Marion Barry who is stepping down after being convicted of
misdemeanor cocaine possession. Democrat Sharon Pratt Dixon is
expected to defeat Republican Maurice Turner, in a city where
Democrats outnumber Republicans 9-1.
   Barry is seeking one of the two at-large City Council positions.
   As the district's efforts to gain statehood continue, Jesse
Jackson is running for one of the two ``shadow'' senator positions.
Those slots were created by the district to lobby Congress.

<HEAD>Taxes Spell Trouble in Key Gubernatorial Races in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxes loom like storm clouds over the prairie in
key elections Tuesday in the Midwest, threatening two governors
scrambling for their jobs and a third candidate bidding for his
first term.
   In a political turnabout, Republican Govs. Kay Orr of Nebraska
and Mike Hayden of Kansas, both first-termers, have been cast by
their Democratic rivals as big spenders, responsible for raising
income or property taxes.
   And in Illinois, Democrat Neil Hartigan has appointed himself
the penny-pinching conservative, while branding GOP opponent Jim
Edgar the tax-promoting liberal.
   ``In this year, the candidate who grabs the tax issue first gets
the benefit out of it,'' said Jim Nowlan, a public policy professor
at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.
   ``People are responding to the anti-tax rhetoric because of this
concern that spending more won't change anything,'' he added.
``There's a very sour mood toward government and politicians on the
part of the public.''
   The impact of such sentiments will be realized Tuesday as nine
Midwest governors - seven incumbents are seeking re-election - are
chosen and eight U.S. senators bid for new terms.
   The Kansas gubernatorial and Illinois Senate challengers hope to
make the record books as the first women in those jobs. Iowa's
Senate race already is historic - the $11-million campaign is the
most expensive ever.
   Though hot-button issues such as abortion have been debated, the
dominance of the anti-tax mood reflects wider economic concerns in
a region still vulnerable, despite its recovery from the '80s farm
crisis and manufacturing decline.
   In September, for example, Michigan and Illinois posted 7.2
percent jobless rates, highest among 11 major states. And rising
oil prices and the Persian Gulf crisis have escalated talk of
recession.
   ``The Midwest is particularly sensitive to dislocation in the
economy,'' said David Axelrod, a Chicago-based political
consultant.
   ``We were the first ones in the recession in the early '80s and
the last ones out. When there's economic turmoil, it tends to favor
challengers,'' he added, citing the GOP in Ohio and Democrats in
Illinois.
   In those states, two governors who've had presidential
hankerings leave office: Illinois' Republican James Thompson
retires after a record 14 years; Ohio's Richard Celeste, a
Democrat, is legally barred from a third consecutive term.
   Nationally, the GOP regards Ohio as one of its best
opportunities to grab a Democratic gubernatorial seat. State
Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr. has emphasized populist
themes; Republican George Voinovich, a former Cleveland mayor,
claims credit for his city's fiscal revival.
   In Illinois, taxes have seized the spotlight. Edgar, secretary
of state, favors making permanent a two-year, 20 percent income tax
increase. Hartigan, state attorney general, opposes it.
   In Kansas, Democratic State Treasurer Joan Finney blames Hayden
for high property taxes resulting from statewide reappraisal and
implementation of a classification system completed in 1989.
   Hayden counters by claiming Mrs. Finney doesn't know anything
about state government.
   The race is a Hobson's choice with both registering ``mammoth
negatives'' in polls, said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas
political science professor.
   ``You've got a governor presiding over a huge property tax
increase, who's not especially popular,'' he said. ``You've got
this woman who's not perceived as especially competent, maybe even
dangerous, in not being up to the job.''
   Abortion also is an issue. Mrs. Finney opposes it, Hayden is
pro-choice.
   In Nebraska, Mrs. Orr, the state's first woman governor, has
been criticized by opponent Democrat Ben Nelson, an attorney, for
her 1987 endorsement of an overhaul of the state's income tax
system.
   She initially denied it caused increases, but now says steps
have been taken to remedy the situation.
   In Minnesota, Gov. Rudy Perpich, once considered vulnerable, has
been on the sidelines watching the tumult in the GOP Party created
by the 11th-hour withdrawal of challenger Jon Grunseth, who was
accused of marital infidelity and swimming nude with teen-age
girls.
   State auditor Arne Carlson, who had launched a 11th-hour
write-in campaign, replaced Grunseth on the ballot.
   Minnesota GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz says the Republican turmoil
has overlapped into his race against college professor Paul
Wellstone, who has surged dramatically in the polls in recent
weeks.
   In Iowa, two Capitol Hill pros are clashing in the Senate race:
Rep. Tom Tauke vs. incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin.
   Tauke calls Harkin a big spender; the senator says his opponent
votes against programs that would help Iowa.
   Tauke opposes abortion, Harkin is pro-choice.
   In Illinois, a Republican House member also hopes to knock off
an incumbent. However, Lynn Martin, initially considered one of the
GOP's brightest prospects, has failed to dent Sen. Paul Simon's
popularity.
   In three gubernatorial contests, state lawmakers are
challengers:
   -Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad faces Democrat Don Avenson, state
House speaker.
   -Michigan Gov. James Blanchard is opposed by GOP state Senate
Majority Leader John Engler.
   -Wisconsin Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson is challenged by
Assembly Speaker Tom Loftus.
   And in the Senate:
   -South Dakota Republican Sen. Larry Pressler faces businessman
Ted Muenster.
   -Indiana's Dan Coats, who inherited Vice President Dan Quayle's
seat, is running against Democratic state Rep. Baron Hill.

<HEAD>Campaign '90: The Issues Changed Faster Than the Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 campaign has been a little like the
capricious New England weather. If you don't like it, just wait a
minute.
   Less than six months ago, politicians were at fever pitch over a
constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning. Reluctant Democrats
feared for their patriotic reputations; crusading Republicans
smelled blood.
   It's hard now to recall the passion and acrimony generated by
that once blazing concern, and harder still to find traces of it on
the campaign trail.
   Ephemeral, fickle, call the season what you will, but issues
came and went almost as quickly as movies of the week - until the
campaign came home to roost in voter pocketbooks.
   ``The only national issue is the economy - taxes, economic
leadership and fairness. It's driving the entire electorate,'' said
analyst Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of The Political Report.
   When candidates first hit the campaign trail months ago,
recession worries were hypothetical and budget negotiations were a
speck on the distant horizon.
   Emotional ``values'' issues were the political currency of the
moment. Some candidates pledged their allegiance to the
flag-burning ban. Others stoked the controversy over federally
funded obscene art.
   Big-state gubernatorial candidates waged a spirited competition
over who would order the most executions, deny the most paroles,
propose the harshest penalties for drug-users.
   Congress was put on the defensive for voting itself a pay raise
and then became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal. The
issues proved potent in a smattering of races, and planted the
first seeds of anti-incumbent, rich-vs.-poor sentiment among
voters.
   Abortion also took a brief turn on center stage. But the waters
got muddied and the issue lost its fire. Both parties ran
candidates with a full range of positions. States, meanwhile,
failed to impose the serious restrictions anticipated in the wake
of a 1989 Supreme Court decision, and abortion moved to the wings
in most races.
   The spotted owl flew by and prompted intense debate in the
Northwest. But the conflict over whether to protect forest habitat
for the tiny owl at the expense of logging jobs never broadened
into a compelling national issue, and environmental concerns
colored only scattered races across the country.
   Communism fell and the peace dividend arose. Early in the
campaign, candidates proposed 50-percent cuts in military spending
and argued over whether to use the money saved from the Cold War
thaw to expand domestic programs or reduce the deficit.
   Then came the late-summer Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia. The peace dividend
vanished like a mirage in the blinding desert sun; the nation
worried about war, incumbents looked like statesmen and other
issues temporarily were swept aside.
   Politicians of both parties rallied behind President Bush's
policies, few of them daring to raise questions or reservations. As
the standoff dragged on without shooting, the gulf crisis waned as
a cutting election issue.
   Finally, in September, an economic decline and explosive federal
budget negotiations combined to produce the potent pocketbook
themes that dominated the campaign's final weeks.
   The battle cry of no new taxes turned into a debate over whose
new taxes and voters witnessed a confusing, chaotic struggle over
their economic futures.
   Democrats railed at ``high-flyers'' and the rich who got richer
in the 1980s at everyone else's expense. ``Let's go and get it from
those who got it,'' Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., declared during
floor debate over whether to raise taxes on the wealthy.
   The ``fairness'' pitch hadn't been particularly successful in
the past and Democratic leaders were not making much headway this
year from the launchpad of the bipartisan S&amp;L scandal.
   The theme was largely ineffective until the Democrats received a
series of assists from Bush - his reversal on the need for new
taxes, his insistence on a capital gains tax cut, his painful
public wavering on whether to raise taxes on the rich, his failure
to adequately explain his positions.
   ``Bush can truly take responsibility for whatever happens on
Tuesday,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato. ``He created the Democrats' best issue, one that they could
never have created for themselves.''
   ``The Republicans gave the Democrats the ammunition,'' agreed
Rothenberg.
   Analysts were not surprised that pocketbook issues ended up
being pivotal.
   Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said the earlier ``boomlets''
were brief because ``it's hard to sustain a political debate when
there is no debate. Everybody's against drugs. Everybody's against
S&amp;L crooks.''
   The budget, by contrast, is ``a real live issue that really does
raise differences,'' Garin said.
   Others suggested that some Republicans drew the wrong
conclusions from Bush's successful use of patriotism and crime
issues two years ago.
   ``Politicians thought they had learned a lesson from 1988 - the
importance of certain symbols, the Republicans pushing
identification with them and the Democrats trying not to look weak
on them,'' said Rothenberg.
   But those were better days.
   ``Symbolic issues only work in times of peace and prosperity,''
said Sabato. ``Whenever the economy weakens, it always takes first
place on the campaign agenda.''

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No longer sheltered from the world
by its checkbook and rigid codes, Saudi Arabia is wielding power in
the region, building its defenses and rethinking its basic tenets.
   Whatever happens with Iraq, knowledgeable Saudis say, there will
be change. In a conservative kingdom without revolutionaries,
however, most predict a supercharged evolution at best.
   ``There is bound to be change - economically, politically,
socially,'' said a prominent Jiddah businessman. ``With outside
pressure, it could take two or three years. Without, maybe five.''
   He said he expected freer expression and more criticism in the
press; there might be pressure groups, such as professional
associations. In the meantime, he added, he did not want to named.
   Barring an uprising, change depends only on King Fahd and accord
among the nearly 5,000 members of the al-Saud family. Saudi Arabia
is a private company with little pressure to go public.
   ``The shock of the crisis will make us think about ourselves,''
said an influential prince who also asked for anonymity. ``I think
we have too much power. We need checks and balances.''
   He said the crisis has opened the society somewhat, as hundreds
of foreign reporters probe matters once kept strictly private.
Substantial change is coming, he added, but at Saudi pace.
   Since the early 1970s, Saudi rulers have kept the outside world
beyond the horizon, avoiding political entanglements and buying
security with generous grants to Arab states and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   They spent heavily on sophisticated weaponry and hired Western
defense technicians.
   Visas were granted sparingly and only with a purpose - for
consultants, salesmen, managers, laborers. Moslem pilgrims were
welcomed to Mecca and Medina, but then sent home again.
   After fundamentalist Saudis seized the Holy Mosque at Mecca in
1979 and were dislodged only after days of bloody fighting, the
kingdom retreated farther into strict Islamic conservatism.
   Secure in a microcosm of its own design, Saudi Arabia lavished
hundreds of billions of dollars on gleaming new cities, storybook
palaces, industrial complexes and luxuries unequaled in the world.
   ``When Saddam Hussein took Kuwait and headed toward us, we
called the army and found no one there,'' said one Saudi official.
``We realized we had better do something fast.''
   Western defense contractors said they epect Saudi Arabia to
triple its armed forces quickly, adding conventional land weapons
to support its high-tech air force.
   Already, Saudi Arabia is using new muscle in the neighborhood.
   When Yemen objected to Western troops in the area, the Saudis
withdrew special status for nearly 2 million Yemenis in the
kingdom. Perhaps as many as 750,000 went home within a month.
   Similarly, Saudi Arabia abruptly halted aid to Jordan and then
cut off its oil supply.
   ``We learned who our real friends were,'' said Prince Abdullah
bin Turki bin Faisal, secretary general of the Royal Commission for
Jubail and Yanbu and a widely respected young Saudi.
   Many Saudis expect the greatest impact to be on the society
itself, caught between a strict reading of the 1,400-year-old Koran
and the latest texts of the Harvard Business School.
   An English-language television network offers American sitcoms,
but ``Roseanne'' has a prayer intermission. Censors blank out words
that might offend, such as underwear, Jews and beer. In one, a
character delivered the old line, ``Hum a few bars of it,'' and the
word ``bars'' came out.
   Liquor is banned and selling it is a felony, but favorite brands
are available on the black market, with an extra zero behind their
normal price.
   Faced with a threat, Saudi Arabia realized how much it depended
on its 4 million Asian, African and Western workers. A third of its
nurses went home within days of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Saudi Arabia will be kinder and gentler toward foreigners,''
said a Filipino business executive. ``But, also, its people will
start to question things, not take them at face value.''
   Saudis echoed this theme.
   ``We must be strong because we are strong, not because we have
the money to be strong,'' said Nihal al-Omari, a Riyadh journalist.
   ``Crisis opened us up to a new reality,'' said Mohammed Ishgi of
the Jiddah Chamber of Commerce. ``We want to be a nation that the
West respects, that can dirty its hands, do the work, and not have
to call a Sri Lankan to fix the plumbing.''
   He added a proviso heard widely among Saudis, foreign diplomats
and Western residents with long experience in the kingdom:
   ``There will be change, but at our pace. The shah modernized
Iran so fast that people got lost. Now they have to go back
again.''
   When the United States dispatched 200,000 troops to the region,
many Saudis expected reverberations from such heresies as
pistol-packing women wearing trousers and driving.
   But most found a greater effect from nearly 200,000 Kuwaitis
seeking refuge from an emirate where men voted and women went
unveiled.
   ``I've never seen an American, but I see Kuwaitis,'' said an
executive of a bank branch reserved for women. ``They tell their
leaders what they think. This is a good idea.''
   She said she was shocked after the invasion of Kuwait when some
members of the Saudi royal family sought shelter at a palace in
Jiddah, protected by a private army. ``It was only for them, not
for us,'' she said. ``After that, things become clear.''
   No serious opposition challenges the al-Saud family, not only
because of strict censorship and rigorous measures against
dissidents, but also because Saudi Arabia offers a comfortable
life.
   ``You don't get many bomb-throwers here,'' a senior Western
diplomat said. ``It's not that kind of place.''
   The last time Saudi Arabia faced a major threat, when Egyptian
leader Gamal Abdel Nasser sent troops to Yemen and moved north in
the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy sent help but also
demanded reforms.
   As a result, Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962 and
introduced education for women.
   This time, U.S. officials said privately, such pressure is not
likely.
   How the kingdom evolves depends largely on events, Saudi and
foreign analysts say. Investment has stalled and billions of
dollars have been transferred elsewhere. At the same time, oil
production rose toward 8 million barrels a day at windfall prices.
   Under most scenarios, the economy is unlikely to change
drastically. More in doubt, the analysts say, is how King Fahd and
his brothers will react to the political and social lessons.
   There already is stiff religious resistance to U.S. troops,
called ``the children of Satan'' by some, guarding holy soil.
   ``A lasting American presence would drastically change the way
of life here,'' said Thierry Mauger, a French author and veteran
Saudi observer.
   The most radical proposals suggest an elected consultative
assembly, such as the one Kuwait had before it was suspended under
emergency conditions in 1986.
   King Fahd has hinted of a consultative body, and chambers were
built in Riyadh for that purpose, but nothing has materialized.
   A leading Jiddah journalist said the royal family will provoke
serious discontent if it does not allow greater press freedom,
lobby groups and other means of airing public opinion.
   ``Major change is inevitable, there is no doubt about that,''
observed an intellectual who also directs a major Saudi company.
``If the rulers are smart, they will stay ahead of it.''

   The U.S. economy grew at a
faster-than-expected 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter, the
government said. But the report failed to dissuade many analysts
who believe the economy is entering a recession.
   The Commerce Department report Tuesday on the gross national
product showed that consumers buying cars and other items had
continued to drive the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S.
history through September. Whether the expansion reaches its eighth
anniversary in November was a matter of debate.
   Also Tuesday, the government said sales of new homes tumbled 6
percent in September to the lowest level in nearly eight years.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Gasoline prices showed no increase Tuesday from
the previous week, the first time since Sept. 18 that they failed
to go up, the American Automobile Association said.
   The nationwide average price for a gallon of self-serve regular
unleaded stood at $1.38 per gallon, the same as the Oct. 23 figure,
AAA said in its weekly survey.
   Also Tuesday, oil prices slid back in very sluggish trading.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A major credit-rating agency downgraded slightly
its opinion of the debt of Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., citing lower ad
revenue at the company's publications, including The Wall Street
Journal, and lower revenue from its electronic information
services.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. Tuesday downgraded about $200
million of Dow Jones' long-term debt from Aa3 to Aa2. The numbers,
from 1 to 3, indicate gradations within the Aa category, which
Moody's uses to indicate high-grade investment bonds.

   NEW YORK (AP) - International Business Machines Corp. unveiled
several new high-end personal computers and workstations that
indicate the computer giant intends to keep its machines in the

   Losses in normally profitable overseas operations contributed
largely to a 78.7 percent drop in Ford Motor Co.'s third-quarter
earnings. The decline at the No. 2 automaker, reported Tuesday, was
much steeper than Wall Street analysts had expected.
   Also Tuesday, General Motors Corp.'s financing, computer
services, and defense and electronics subsidiaries said that their
third-quarter profits rose by a combined 17.3 percent over the same
period last year.
   In other Detroit news, the United Auto Workers and Chrysler
Corp. reached a tentative agreement on a three-year contract,
matching an industry pattern the company repeatedly had said it

   WASHINGTON (AP) - About 330,000 farmers participating in the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program soon will be getting $1.6
billion in rental payments for taking cropland from production,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said.
   The payments, announced Tuesday and to begin immediately, are
for the 1991 fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Yeutter said the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
will notify county offices to begin payments immediately ``without
any further delay.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Michael Milken's lawyers say the government
failed to prove charges aired at a special hearing that the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond financier was a ``master
criminal.''
   In written arguments Tuesday after eight days of testimony, the
defense once again denied charges beyond those Milken admitted in
his April guilty plea to six felony counts. The defense also said a
government witness lied during the hearing, and it attacked
arguments that Milken alone had the power to order corrupt activity
at Drexel.

   CHICAGO (AP) - United Airlines said it will raise fares on most
domestic flights by 5.8 percent on Halloween, joining other major
carriers in a price increase prompted by a jump in fuel prices.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said Tuesday the carrier was
boosting prices to match the fares of other airlines that announced
increases earlier. The industry-wide fare increase on domestic
routes takes effect Wednesday.
   Also Tuesday, America West Airlines said it will freeze hiring
and eliminate some flights after reporting a $22 million loss for
the third quarter of 1990.

   USX Tuesday also reported its third-quarter earnings dropped 6.8
percent from a year earlier, with gains in the energy segment but a
26 percent income drop from the steel division.

   The stock market turned in a mixed performance as some late
buying sent blue chips higher but the broader market was mired in
Wall Street's economic doldrums. The Dow Jones industrial average,
which reversed course several times during the day, Tuesday ended
up 17.82 at 2,448.02.
   Bonds rose, strengthened by news of weaker oil prices and a
better-than-expected auction of new U.S. Treasury debt.
   The dollar finished higher in Europe following a
better-than-expected report on the U.S. economy, but the advance
ran out of steam in domestic dealings. Gold prices were up sharply.

   David Packard, one of the patriarchs of
Silicon Valley, is more visible these days at the computer giant he
helped build as the firm copes with dramatic corporate changes.
   Neither Packard, 78, nor William Hewlett, 77, both
multibillionaires, are returning to day-to-day management of
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   But Packard, still chairman, and Hewlett, retired director and
former president, participated in an analysis of the company's
recent woes that led to a shakeup at the highest levels earlier
this month.
   Chief Executive Officer John A. Young now shares top
decision-making powers with chief operating officer Dean Morton.
Several vice presidents - notably Lewis Platt, Richard Hackborn and
Bill Terry - were given more authority and are considered as
successor to Young in the next few years.
   Packard is careful not to suggest that he's taking over command
again or undermining Young in any way.
   ``He's going to be managing the company and he has Bill's and my
complete support on what he's plans to do,'' said Packard.
   But the fact that Packard is getting more involved is an
indication of the company's concern about its direction.
   ``Packard has been more visible and more involved in consulting
with John on changes in the company's management structure and its
organization,'' said company spokesman Roy Verley. ``What is
significant about this change is we've attempted to set ourselves
up a bit for ultimate succession of management in the next few
years.''
   Analysts say the change in Young's duties obviously made him
weaker and cast some doubt on the company's leadership.
   ``My opinion is Young didn't do that on his own volition. He got
pressure from his board to create that office and bring Morton
in,'' said John B. Jones of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   But Packard looks at it in a more benign way, comparing Young to
a star quarterback and saying ``Bill Hewlett and I are going to be
coaching him from the sidelines. We're not going to be calling the
plays, but we are going to give him whatever help and coaching he
needs.''
   Hewlett-Packard ends its fiscal year today on Halloween, but
unless it comes up with a quick trick it's not likely to be treated
any better on Wall Street.
   The stock price has dropped during the past year, from a high of
50&rsqb; to a close Tuesday of 26|.
   In the first nine months the company posted revenues of $9.6
billion, up from $8.5 billion in 1989, but earnings during the
period fell to $537 million from $583 million.
   Analysts anticipate Hewlett-Packard's year-end numbers, when
released in two weeks, will show similar growth in revenues to
about $13.2 billion, and a further drop in earnings.
   ``Unless they produce some surprises, the investment community
will be very critical of them,'' said Jones.
   Packard said he is more concerned about making sure that his
company's ``corporate values are right and that our business
direction is sound.'' The company is looking to strengthen itself
for the long run, he said, and isn't worried about quarterly
profits or the current stock price.
   ``What Packard is signaling is that they have not made analysts
happy for some time, which is why the stock is sitting at a buck or
two above book value,'' Jones said.
   Historically, Hewlett-Packard is not a company that hacks
expenses to please investors. Rather, the company believes in
building morale and camaraderie for the long-term. Its benevolent
attitude toward employees and customers - dubbed ``the H-P Way'' -
has made it a model for high-tech companies in Silicon Valley for
half a century.
   That attitude, which some disgruntled employees say was
beginning to wither, is evident in the company's effort to pare
down from a peak of 95,000 workers in 1989 after the purchase of
Apollo, a workstation maker. Current employment is 92,000
worldwide, including more than 20,000 in the San Francisco Bay area
and 37,000 overseas.
   ``The cuts are gradual and continuing,'' said Verley. Rather
than firing workers, the company is trimming through attrition,
hiring controls and a workforce rebalancing program that allows
workers to find other jobs in the company.
   Perhaps as significant as the sharing of power between Young and
Morton, is the streamlining of the organization below them.
   The new system is more centralized and allows, for example, all
the computer systems businesses and sales forces to report to one
individual, Platt, who has responsibility for profits and losses.
Hackborn, likewise, is in charge of peripherals, and Terry is in
charge of measurement systems.
   Those three areas comprise the bulk of Hewlett-Packard's
business.
   Platt has the largest revenue sector - nearly 50 percent of the
company's total - with minicomputers, workstations, service and
computer systems software.

<HEAD>USX Makes Steel Division Separate Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp.'s decision to make its steel
operations a separate company came as no surprise to many analysts,
who expect the energy and steel giant to sell its metals business
eventually.
   ``Someday you're going to see this company in two major pieces,
two separate entities,'' said Greg Drahuschak, a steel analyst with
Butcher &amp; Singer in Pittsburgh. ``It's the only way I can ever see
that the shareholder is going to get the benefits of the two
businesses.''
   USX said its board of directors voted Tuesday to transfer the
business carried out by the USS steel division to a wholly owned
subsidiary. USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said the move ``will
provide the flexibility for any steel restructuring undertaken by
the company.''
   USX also reported its third-quarter earnings dropped 6.8 percent
from a year earlier, with gains in the energy segment but a 26
percent income drop from the steel division.
   USX spokesman William L. Keslar said the move to separate the
steel division was not prompted by takeover strategist Carl Icahn's
proposal to spin off at least 80 percent of the steel business in
the form of a dividend to shareholders. The proposal by Icahn,
USX's largest shareholder with a 13.3 percent stake, was rejected
by other shareholders May 7.
   Icahn considers steel a drain on USX's Marathon Oil Co. and
Texas Oil and Gas Corp.
   Keslar said the board's vote ``simply puts USS on the same
footing as Marathon, making it a subsidiary.''
   ``Somewhere down the road if you want to spin it off, it's
certainly easier to do it as a subsidiary than as a part of the
company,'' he said. ``It's simply providing the means to have that
flexibility.''
   Icahn said in a telephone interview from his Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
office that the change is ``a step in the right direction, but they
have to take a lot more steps to separate the two companies.''
   ``So far, it's lip service to what has to be done,'' he said.
``This does not really help to reflect the values of the stock.''
   Charles Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York,
said he expects USX to try to sell a small part of the company,
perhaps 20 percent, in a public offering by the end of the year.
   ``That will establish what the company is worth,'' he said.
``They can sell a small piece now and sell the rest later on.''
   Andrew V. ``Lefty'' Palm, chairman of the United Steelworkers of
America's chief negotiating committee, said the steel division's
new status raises questions that will be addressed in contract
talks.
   ``Essentially, we're not supportive of the idea of splitting up
USX,'' said USW President L. Lynn Williams. ``We think the
long-term best interests of our members are best served by the
steel division remaining a part of USX and being provided the basic
strength of an energy company.''
   The union is negotiating a new contract for 18,000 union members
employed by USX in seven states. The two sides have set a Nov. 10
target date for a new pact.
   Earnings for the 1990 third quarter totaled $163 million, or 63
cents a share, compared with $175 million, or 62 cents a share, in
the same quarter of 1989. Earnings per share increased mainly
because of a significant reduction in preferred stock outstanding,
USX said.
   Quarterly revenues totaled $5.11 billion compared with $4.42
billion, up about 16 percent.
   In the company's energy division, operating income increased 47
percent to $278 million on sales of $3.7 billion, compared with
$189 million on sales of $3 billion in the year-ago period.
   The steel segment reported operating income fell nearly 26
percent to $63 million on sales of $1.3 billion, from $85 million
on sales of $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 1989.
   Corry said the latest results from operations actually outpaced
the previous third quarter, which included $98 million in profits
from asset sales and $179 million in favorable effects of special
items. The 1990 third quarter included $5 million in pretax profits
from asset sales.

   The petroleum industry as a whole did not reap a
third-quarter windfall from the Persian Gulf crisis, a leading
trade group said in a defense of Big Oil against charges of
profiteering.
   ``The third-quarter earnings statements released by several oil
companies show that oil companies have not gouged the public,''
American Petroleum Institute President Charles J. DiBona said at a
press briefing Tuesday.
   DiBona said total operating income was unchanged from the third
quarter of 1989 and below the same period in 1988, based on reports
from 18 top U.S. petroleum companies.
   Industry earnings were actually something of a mix, ranging from
double- and triple-digit increases in profits at some companies to
double-digit decreases at others.
   Amerada Hess Corp., for example, reported a 440.5 percent
increase in earnings, based largely on profits from successful oil
futures trading.
   ``It shows they were able to judge the future better than other
people,'' DiBona said.
   In response to the API report, some industry foes still
contended the companies were taking advantage of the Gulf crisis,
which began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``It's wrong for them to say they're not doing quite well,''
said Edwin S. Rothschild, energy policy director for Citizen
Action, a consumers group in Washington. ``They are making lots of
money while people are hurting.''
   While income from operations was unchanged, total net income for
the 18 companies cited by DiBona showed an increase of 16.5 percent
for the quarter, according to API's figures. Net income includes
special one-time items, such as Amerada Hess's gains in the futures
market.
   As analysts had predicted, the production branches of big oil
companies - the so-called ``upstream'' end of the business - made
plenty of extra money as oil prices shot up during the crisis.
   But the refining and marketing divisions - the ``downstream''
end - generally did not do as well. They had to shell out higher
prices for the crude oil they imported.
   In addition, DiBona said, oil profits have been kept down as the
companies refrained from passing along all of the higher crude
costs in retail prices for gasoline and home heating oil.
   Christopher Dyson of the Ralph Nader consumer group, Buyers Up,
said he believes oil companies were trying to conceal how well
they're doing.
   ``There's a lot of little accounting tricks which oil companies
can do with their profit figures,'' Dyson said. ``That tends to
make them look less dramatic than they are.''
   Dyson declined to offer specifics, but said, for example, that
oil companies can try to hide their profits by putting large sums
into funds that will be used for eventual environmental cleanups at
drilling sites. Industry analysts have said oil companies do this,
but they point out it is an accepted accounting technique that
shows up in public statements from the corporations.
   Dyson also found fault with API's use of industrywide
statistics.
   ``I would argue first of all that there were some companies that
did very well,'' he said. ``It's nice the oil companies broke even,
because a lot of other industries, such as the airline industry,
are losing billions of dollars because of this crisis.''
   Citizen Action acknowledged that oil companies showed restraint
in pricing shortly after the invasion, so it has backed off on its
allegations of price-gouging, at least for now.
   Among the big oil companies that showed higher net income in the
third quarter were Amoco Corp., up 57.7 percent; Atlantic Richfield
Co., up 21.9 percent; Occidental Petroleum Corp., up 0.9 percent;
Phillips Petroleum Co., up 104.6 percent; Texaco Inc., up 24.9
percent; and Unocal Corp., up 53.2 percent.
   Among those showing lower net income were Chevron Corp., down
3.4 percent; Mobil Corp., down 28.8 percent; Shell Oil Co., down
33.2 percent; and Sun Co., down 70.6 percent.
   Exxon Corp. reported quarterly earnings that were unchanged.

<HEAD>Chrysler Falls Into Line; UAW Has Contacts at All of Big Three</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp., which said it needed
the United Auto Workers to give it relief from labor costs, has a
new tentative agreement very similar to contracts at General Motors
and Ford.
   The company and union reached a tentative agreement Tuesday
afternoon after 27 straight hours of bargaining. There was no
strike and the 63,000 UAW members covered by the agreement worked
without a contract for about a half-day.
   UAW President Owen Bieber bragged at a news conference that the
union had reached its goal of bargaining a pattern agreement used
at each of the Big Three.
   ``It's a pattern settlement and a pattern settlement in all
respects,'' Bieber said. ``It's a total pattern settlement.''
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, the company's main
negotiator, agreed the contract was mostly patterned on UAW deals
with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   ``The tentative agreement reached today with the UAW contains
elements of the pattern, but also some provisions which addresses
needs specific to Chrysler,'' he said.
   Bieber and St. John declined to talk about details of the
contract pending a Monday union leaership meeting in Detroit. If
it wins approval by the group of local presidents and bargaining
council chairs, the contract will be sent out for rank-and-file
ratification.
   It appeared that the union and company agreed to push for a new
production schedule at Chrysler's profitable St. Louis II minivan
plant, which has about 3,500 employees.
   Last November, members of UAW Local 110 in St. Louis
overwhelmingly rejected a move endorsed by the company and the
UAW's leadership to change from a normal two-shift production
schedule to one involving three crews, two shifts and a 20-percent
production increase.
   The company said the change would have swollen the plant's
employment by 1,000 to 1,300 workers. But union members turned down
the proposal saying it could cut out overtime.
   St. John said also the company and union agreed to continue the
``30-and-out'' retirement program that allows an employee to get
retirement benefits after 30 years of service, regardless of age.
   The company had pressed for pension payments to be held until
the worker is 60 years old.
   ``There are elements in this agreement that are particularly
helpful to Chrysler's case,'' St. John said.
   Bieber and St. John declined to answer questions about
health-care provisions, which were seen as a major sticking point
in the talks. In the GM-Ford pattern agreement, there is no change
in the method of coverage, but the union and the companies agreed
to look for ways to cut costs.
   Chrysler said it spent $684 million on health-care last year.
Chrysler has nearly one retiree for every active worker - a higher
proportion than GM or Ford. A higher percentage of retirees
increases a company's health-care bill.
   The UAW reached an agreement with GM on Sept. 17. After that
contract was ratified, it took just six days for the union and Ford
to reach a tentative agreement, which was ratified earlier this
month.
   The union canceled an extension of its Chrysler contract at
midnight Monday but told members to report to their jobs as usual
Tuesday while bargaining continued.
   Late Tuesday morning, Bieber and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
held a 1{-hour private meeting, which broke up about four hours
before the tentative agreement was announced.
   The agreement came a day after Chrysler reported a third-quarter
loss of $214 million, mostly from incentive costs and lost
production due to the retooling of its minivan plants in St. Louis
and Windsor, Ontario. Those are among the company's most profitable
factories.
   Analysts said that despite the loss, Chrysler is in decent
financial shape.
   ``They've got $3 billion in cash,'' said David Healy of
investment bankers Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York City.
``They're not in financial trouble at all, far from it. They will
be profitable for the year.''

   Harold Evans, founding editor in chief of Conde
Nast Traveler and a former editor of The Times of London, has been
named president and publisher of Random House Adult Trade Books.
   Random House Inc. said Tuesday that Evans, 61, will be replacing
Joni Evans, 48, as publisher of the Adult Trade Books imprint,
which publishes general fiction and non-fiction.
   Ms. Evans, no relation to Harold Evans, will start her own list
of books for Random House, said Alberto Vitale, chairman of Random
House.
   Evans also has been named executive vice president of Random
House. Ms. Evans also holds that title.
   William T. Loverd, a Random House spokesman, said the change was
a surprise but ``not an upheaval.'' He said 1990 has been one of
the most successful years for the Adult Trade Books imprint.
   Random House publishes more than 100 titles a year including
books by such well-known authors as William Styron, James Michener
and Norman Mailer.
   Ms. Evans joined Random House in 1987 with the intention of
starting her own imprint, Loverd said. Her new imprint, still to be
named, will be housed in a brownstone in midtown Manhattan outside
the Random House headquarters.
   As publisher and president of Random House Adult Trade Books,
Harold Evans will have the overall responsibility for the
publishing and editorial direction of the imprint, in addition to
heading Villard Books and Times Books.
   Evans was editor of the Sunday Times of London for 14 years
starting in 1967 and became editor of The Times of London, the
daily, in February of 1981. He resigned that post in March 1982 in
a dispute with the owner, Rupert Murdoch.
   In 1986, Evans joined Conde Nast Publications as founding
editor-in-chief of Conde Nast Traveler, which has won praise from
media critics for publishing features that were often critical of
potential advertisers.
   Both Random House and Conde Nast are owned by the Newhouse
familiy's Advance Publications Inc.

   First Brands Corp., citing sagging capital
markets and a sluggish economy, has announced it is no longer for
sale.
   The company, which manufacturers Glad bags, Prestone antifreeze
and STP car care products, said Tuesday that its major
shareholders, First Boston Corp. and the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., had discontinued talks with potential buyers.
   First Brands announced that it was up for sale in June, after
investors said they had received several inquiries about the
company.
   Donald DeSantis, vice president and chief financial officer,
said the slow economy, coupled with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a
declining bond market, hurt acquisition possibilities.
   ``The combination of all those things just provided a climate
that wasn't conducive for selling a business,'' he said.
   Alfred E. Dudley, First Brands chairman, president and chief
executive officer, and 28 other managers launched First Brands in
1986 with an $840 million leveraged buyout from Union Carbide.
   In three years, First Brands reduced its work force, sold two
divisions, boosted sales and cut debt. Between 1987 and 1989, the
company went from a $6.98 million loss to a net income of $60.9
million.
   First Brands had sales of more than $1 billion and earnings of
$50 million for the year ended in June. The company employs 3,350
people worldwide.

   Weyerhaeuser Co. laid the groundwork for
the next generation of executive leadership by elevating president
John W. ``Jack'' Creighton Jr. to the newly created office of chief
executive.
   Creighton in turn named five men to his executive team to head
Weyerhaeuser's various operations, and plans to name a sixth next
year.
   Creighton, 58, is expected to succeed George H. Weyerhaeuser,
64, as chief executive when Weyerhaeuser retires in mid-1991.
Weyerhaeuser will stay on as chairman of the board of the timber
company.
   In the meantime, he will share the new office of chief executive
with Creighton.
   The changes, announced Tuesday, will ``bring about an effective
leadership transition at the top of Weyerhaeuser Co.,'' the company
said.
   Weyerhaeuser said the new configuration was also set up in part
to help bolster the company's financial performance.
   Creighton's executive team includes executive vice presidents
Charles W. Bingham, 57, and John H. Waechter, 62; senior vice
president and chief financial officer William C. Stivers, 52; and
senior vice presidents Norman E. Johnson, 57, and Steven R. Hill,
43.
   Two other executives, chief financial officer Robert L.
Schuyler, 54, and Frederick R. Fosmire, 64, senior vice president
for human resources, technology and engineering, are retiring next
year, the company said.
   Creighton and his executive team will oversee a continuing
restructuring in which Weyerhaeuser sells some businesses and
reduces the size of others. Last week the company announced it will
trim its work force at its Longview pulp and paper operations over
the next several years, although it didn't say how many jobs will
be cut.

   The Canadian government has awarded
Control Data Corp. a 10-year, $850 million contract to provide the
Canadian armed forces with a global network communications system.
   Analysts on Tuesday said the contract - the largest in the

undergone a major restructuring after record 1989 losses.
   ``This contract is positive testimony of their capabilities in

delivered for two years. The contract will be a break-even deal for
the company over the next 12 months, she said, after which it
should start generating profits.
   Jadwin said she did not know how much the company expects to
make from the contract.
   Control Data has eliminated several unprofitable businesses and
improved operations in its remaining divisions over the past 15
months.
   Last week the company reported third-quarter earnings of $8.5
million on revenues of $434.1 million. For the nine months, Control
Data earned $26.5 million, or 62 cents a share, on revenues of
$1.26 billion.
   The communications system, called Iris, will replace
1950s-vintage communications equipment still in use by the Canadian
forces.
   Specifics of the development and production contract, which must
be signed by the Treasury Board of Canada, will be negotiated over
the next 60 days.
   As part of the deal, Control Data, acting through Computing
Devices, will build a factory in Calgary, Alberta. Its cost, which
is being negotiated, will be paid by the government as part of the
contract.
   Dick Holm, a spokesman for the government systems division, said
the communications system will ``move us into an application area
that is new to us and has great growth potential.''
   He said Control Data hopes to sell the system to Canadian allies
who will want a compatible communications system.

<HEAD>Citicorp Eliminating 2,000 Jobs In Corporate Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company,
said today that by the end of next year about 2,000 jobs will be
eliminated through an ongoing reorganization of its corporate
business.
   The disclosure provides the first indication of the size of
layoffs since the company's retrenchment in corporate financing
activities began several months ago.
   Bank profits generally have been battered in recent months by
writeoffs related to loans for commercial real estate and by a
decline in lending activity for buyouts.
   Citicorp spokeswoman Anne Luzzatto said the layoffs are mostly
middle management and professionals in lending and deal making. She
said they were expected to be completed by the end of 1991.
   The corporate business division, which covers Japan, Europe and
North America and Australia, had about 17,000 employees and plans
to reduce expenses by more than $250 million annually, she said.
   The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on the actual
number of layoffs today, quoting Michael Callen, the executive in
charge of the division, as saying as many as 700 people in North
America have left so far, with an additional 400 employees to be
notified by year end.
   Luzzatto said about half of the remaining 900 intended cuts are
employees in Asia and Europe.
   The rest of the 450 cuts will come from businesses targeted for
sale by the end of 1991, she said.
   Some of the largest personnel cutbacks have come in the
leveraged loan division, where business is off because of the
decline in leveraged corporate buypouts and equipment finance and
leasing, Luzzatto said.
   Other reorganization moves include the consolidation of
Citicorp's 18 corporate finance offices in the United States into
six primary locations and concentration of commercial real estate
activity into nine offices rather than 21 locations, she said.
   No such personnel reductions are planned for the consumer
banking operation, which employs 77,000 people, according to the
Journal story.
   The Journal report also said Citicorp Chairman John Reed is
considering strategic alliances with other large global banks.
   Reed reportedly told the Harvard Business Review in an interview
that is to be published soon that strategic alliances under which
Citicorp would swap portions of its business with other major banks
could help build a stronger capital base.

   A Connecticut company says it has just
the answer for hospitals looking for a better, cheaper way to
dispose of infectious medical waste: Cook the stuff in a giant
microwave.
   Nothing is emitted into the air and the treated waste, which
takes up just one-eighth of its original space, can be dumped into
an ordinary landfill, says ABB Sanitec Inc.
   ``It's a brand new solution,'' said David C. Knesel, spokesman
for Forsyth Memorial Hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C., which bought
a Sanitec unit for $500,000 in February.
   ABB Sanitec has gained regulatory approval in two states and is
seeking the go-ahead in six others for its system, which grinds up
and decontaminates infectious medical waste.
   One of the main attractions of the system for hospitals is its
relatively low cost, which is saving Forsyth more than $200,000 a
year in waste disposal. So far, Forsyth is the only U.S. hospital
using the system, which is subject to a state-by-state review.
   In addition to North Carolina, the system has been given thumbs
up in California and is under consideration in New Jersey, Ohio,
New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas, according to ABB
Sanitec President John L. Cusack.
   The ABB Sanitec system has been sold to 10 hospitals and waste
disposal companies in France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy since
1986, Cusack said.
   The system is manufactured in West Germany and sells for
$500,000 to $600,000, he said. The company makes the system in two
sizes, and can set the unit on wheels so that two or more small
hospitals could share it, Cusack said.
   ABB Sanitec is a unit of Asea Brown Boveri Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary of ABB Ltd. of Zurich, Switzerland.
   The patented system comes in a self-contained, computerized,
20-by-8-foot metal box that looks like a large trash compactor.
Waste is dumped into the box, sent through a shredder and zapped
for a half-hour with microwaves, leaving nothing but a pile of
small garbage pieces that's less harmful than normal kitchen
garbage.
   ``It looks like potpourri when it dries out,'' Forsyth's Knesel
said. ``It's colorful, actually. It's got all kinds of different
colors and different pieces.''
   Microwaving the waste exposes it to high temperatures that
destroy microorganisms, said V. James McLarney, director of the
division of health facilities management for the American Hospital
Association.
   He said microwaving is an environmentally sound method, but that
it is just one of many technologies being developed to dispose of
medical waste, including treating the waste with chemicals or
radiation and incineration.
   Since there are not yet national regulations regarding the
disposal of medical waste, individual states approve disposal
methods, McLarney said.
   ``To use a new technology requires that the state include that
new technology on the list of accepted treatment alternatives,'' he
said.
   The problem of medical waste disposal made headlines in 1988
when needles, syringes and other products washed up on shores in
the Northeast. Hospitals facing stringent disposal laws pay up to
50 cents a pound to dispose of their medical waste, according to
the AHA.
   The ABB Sanitec system costs between 7 and 10 cents a pound,
Cusack said.
   Knesel said Forsyth had been spending $270,000 a year to have
its infectious medical waste hauled in refrigerated trucks to a
special medical waste incinerator. With ABB Sanitec, the cost has
dropped to $60,000 a year, he said.
   ``We figure this unit will probably pay for itself by 1992,''
Knesel said.
   Some hospitals have considered building their own incinerators
to dispose of their waste, but the high costs of adding
pollution-control systems and strong public sentiment against
incinerators make that option more difficult, he said.
   Knesel said that was exactly the case with Forsyth, a 926-bed
hospital and one of the largest in North Carolina.
   ``We were planning to build our own incinerator ... and really
were disturbed about having to do so,'' he said. ``It's politically
impossible in this state to build a medical incinerator ... there
are protests everywhere, and we really had better things to do than
to deal with an irate public about an incinerator.''
   In California, where one Sanitec unit was bought by a waste
disposal company, the device was easily approved for statewide use,
said Nancy Smith, a health program adviser for the state Department
of Health.
   California officials evaluated the unit for its ability to
disinfect medical waste and for harmful emissions, Smith said.

<TEXT>
   To some Western creditors, Premier
Ante Markovic forged an economic miracle by slashing inflation from
2,500 percent to near zero in six months and saving Yugoslavia from
bankruptcy.
   The 65-year-old pragmatist stopped the runaway price spiral,
boosted hard currency reserves and pushed foreign debt below $16
billion for the first time in more than a decade.
   But the gains have proved temporary. Inflation is creeping
upward again, and unemployment is rising. Many businessmen complain
that Markovic's reforms have gone too far and are disrupting
Yugoslavia's transition to capitalism from communism.
   Markovic's main anti-inflationary tool - the newly convertible
dinar currency pegged at seven to one German mark - spells problems
for many companies, even those considered closest to Western
business practices.
   The exchange rate, introduced Jan. 1, restored confidence in the
Yugoslav currency after it had plunged in value against Western
currencies. But companies now say the exchange rate should be 11 or
12 dinars per mark to make their products more competitive.
   Unemployment, already 17 percent nationwide, could top a quarter
of the work force as the reforms take hold.
   Inflation also has become a problem again. After plummeting from
an annual 2,500 percent in 1989 to zero in the second quarter of
this year, inflation took a 7 percent jump in September. The annual
rate could far surpass the government's 17 percent forecast.
   Tight credit and a wage freeze helped throttle inflation, but
one result is that Yugoslav products have become even more
expensive at home than many imported items.
   ``If I go to the supermarket and cheese from Hungary and
Austrian margarine are cheaper - why should I buy Yugoslav?'' asked
Alenka Ogrin, a tourist guide from Ljubljana.
   Western investors have been scared away from Yugoslavia by
simmering ethnic and political tensions. More than anything,
Markovic now needs social stability to consolidate his reforms.
   Matija Skof, president of Sloveniales, one of Yugoslavia's
largest trading companies, halved profit targets to $10 million
this year after sales prospects dwindled at home and abroad.
   Founded in 1948 to export furniture, Sloveniales deals in
everything from household goods to helicopters.
   But Skof still sees some reasons for optimism.
   ``We're still notching up a real growth rate of 5 percent on
last year's sales of $1.35 billion,'' he said. ``We reorganized as
a private company in July and we're running like one - on the
profit motive.''
   Under Yugoslavia's self-management system, companies are
technically owned by their workers. Markovic's reforms are supposed
to weed out unprofitable companies buoyed for decades by state
subsidies, cheap bank credits and a weak dinar. The debts of many
companies are virtually impossible to calculate.
   Markovic, premier since March 1989, is determined to revitalize
the economy by ending wasteful subsidies, but some critics say his
measures are too harsh.
   Political squabbling among Yugoslavia's six republics
complicates the issue.
   Slovenia and Croatia, where center-right parties ousted
Communist governments in free elections this year, are pushing for
a new loose confederation of sovereign states in a common market.
   The southern, less-developed republics of Serbia,
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia are still in Communist
hands ahead of elections later this year. They tend toward a more
centralized federation.
   Serbian authorities are vetoing reforms they say are against
their interests. They have subsidized wheat prices and refused to
shut giant loss-makers like Smederevo steel works that employs
16,000 workers.
   ``There was a dream that Markovic could save Yugoslavia but it's
now clear that we need political reorganization before we can talk
about economic programs,'' said Danilo Slivnik, domestic editor at
Delo, Slovenia's leading daily newspaper.
   ``Socialism is still entrenched in over half of Yugoslavia - so
how can free-market reforms work?'' he asked.
   Slovenia's Social Planning Institute estimates that 40 mostly
large enterprises in Yugoslavia's richest republic will face
bankruptcy this year, including showcase ski producer Elan.
   With only 8 percent of the country's population, Slovenia
produces more than 25 percent of Yugoslav exports. In
less-developed republics, many more enterprises could go bust.
   ``Markovic was right to stop inflation with harsh measures, but
he should have let up in June and given the economy a breathing
space,'' Skof asserted.
   The federal government says rising exports prove the economy is
rebounding. Other observers disagree.
   ``It's just an illusion,'' asserted one analyst at a bank in
Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. ``Companies are exporting
because they have no home market and it's easier to get paid from
abroad, even if that means selling at a loss and eating into their
capital.''

   The stock market eked out a small gain today as
traders kept a close watch on oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.20 to 2,453.22 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 524 up, 360 down and
518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.09 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery slipped about 50
cents a barrel, to just above $34 a barrel, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said that provided some tentative support for stocks,
which have been bouncing around erratically in recent sessions.
   In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new
factory orders rose 0.1 percent in September. Excluding oil,
however, the total showed a 1.1 percent decline.
   On Tuesday the government reported a stronger-than-expected gain
in the gross national product, at a 1.8 percent annual rate after
adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   But brokers said that failed to convince most market
participants that the business outlook had improved to any

   General Motors Corp. today reported a $2 billion
loss for the third quarter including a one-time charge of $2.1
billion for closing four assembly plants and related expenses.
   The loss amounts to $3.54 per common share. GM had earned $516.9
million, or 72 cents a share, in the July-September quarter a year
earlier.
   Without the charge, GM's earnings for the latest period stood at
$109 million, down 78.9 percent from earnings a year earlier.
   GM's third-quarter revenue rose 6.9 percent to $30.8 billion
from $28.8 billion last year.
   The $2.1 billion charge includes costs associated with the
formal shutting down of four assembly plants the were idled during
the past three years. Those car plants are near Kansas City, Mo.;
Framingham, Mass.; Pontiac, Mich.; and Atlanta.
   The company said the charge also contemplates the closing or
consolidating of other plants and warehouses during the next three
years. The company previously had announced it planned to idle
truck assembly plants in Scarborough, Ontario; Lordstown, Ohio; and
Pontiac.
   ``The restructuring is a major element in GM's long-term
strategic plan to improve the competitiveness and profitability of
its North American operations,'' GM Chairman Robert Stempel said in
a statement today.
   Including the charge, GM said it lost $368.7 million, or $1.20 a
share, in the first nine months of the year compared with a profit
of $3.52 billion, or $5.32 a share, in the first nine months of
1989.
   Revenues for the January-September period were $94.8 billion
this year, down 0.8 percent from $95.6 billion a year ago.
   On Tuesday, GM's major subsidiaries reported their third-quarter
results.
   Among the subsidiaries, General Motors Acceptance Corp. reported
the largest jump, 24.7 percent. Electronic Data Systems Corp. said
its profits rose 17 percent and GM-Hughes Electronics Corp.
reported earnings up 7 percent.
   GMAC said it earned $293 million during the three months ended
Sept. 30, compared with $235 million for the third quarter of 1989.
   EDS said it had net income of $128.4 million, or 54 cents a
share, for the period, up from $110.9 million, or 46 cents a share,
for July-September 1989.
   Revenues for the quarter rose to $1.53 billion from $1.37
billion in the third quarter of 1989, the company said.
   GM Hughes Electronics said it had net income of $158.1 million,
or 40 cents a share, for the quarter, up from $147.8 million, or 37
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenues rose to $2.93 billion for the period from $2.58 billion
in the third quarter of 1989, the company said.

   Eastman Kodak Co., ordered by a court to
pay $909.5 million in damages to Polaroid Corp., said today it
suffered a $206 million loss in the third quarter.
   Kodak said its earnings would have increased 19 percent without
the judgment against it.
   The photographic company said the loss, which translated to 64
cents per share, compared with earnings of $510 million, or 93
cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   The U.S. District Court in Boston earlier this month awarded
$454.2 million in damages and $455.3 million in interest to
Polaroid in a 14-year-old patent infringement suit against Kodak.
   Both Kodak and Polaroid have appealed the decision, but Kodak
decided to take a $909.5 million charge against its third-quarter
earnings to cover the costs of the award.
   ``While no money has yet changed hands, and the litigation has
yet to be finally resolve, this charge to earnings is appropriate
at this time,'' Kodak Chairman Kay R. Whitmore said in a statement.
   Without the charge, earnings would have been $358 million, up 19
percent from $300 million a year earlier, Kodak said.
   Sales increased 5 percent for the quarter to $4.77 billion,
compared to $4.54 billion in the same quarter last year.
   Whitmore said Kodak's strong sales gains in international
markets were partly offset by lagging U.S. shipments that reflected
the weakening economy in this country.
   Earnings for the first three quarters of 1990 totaled $377
million, or $1.16 per share, down 36 percent from $589 million, or
$1.82 per share, in 1989.
   Without the Polaroid charge, earnings would have been up 60
percent to $941 million.
   This third quarter was only the fourth time Kodak has ever taken
a loss. The last time was in the fourth quarter of 1989 when Kodak
took a charge of $273 million to pay for a restructuring program in
which 7,500 jobs were cut and about 20 businesses were sold or
consolidated.
   That restructuring was announced following depressed earnings in
the first three quarters of 1989.

<HEAD>Settlement Reached After 15 Years in Poisoning Case</HEAD>

   A Japanese company has agreed to pay $3.5 million
to 41 victims of arsenic poisoning blamed on mining operations in a
case first taken to court 15 years ago, officials announced
Wednesday.
   Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. and the plaintiffs accepted the
compromise plan recommended by the Supreme Court, according to a
court official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Eighteen of the victims are still alive. The rest were
represented by family members.
   Tatsuro Kamata, a spokesman of Sumitomo Metal Mining, said in a
statement that the company agreed to pay the amount not as
compensation but as a token of sympathy. He said the agreement did
not refer to the question of the company's responsibility for the
poisoning.
   The plaintiffs had demanded a total of $16.6 million in
compensation, Kamata said.
   An official of the Environment Agency, also speaking on
condition of anonmity, said residents near a mine on the
southernmost main island of Kyushu suffered arsenic poisoning from
fumes. He said the mine had been burning ore containing arsenic
since 1920 to manufacture arsenic acid for agricultural use.
   Arsenic poisoning damages the nerves, liver, skin and other
human organs. Kamata said Sumitomo Metal Mining received mining
rights for the Toroku Mine from Nakajima Mining Co. in 1967 as a
payment for Nakajima's debts to Sumitomo. But Sumitomo gave up the
rights in 1973 without ever engaging in mining or any other
operations at the mine, he added.
   In 1975, 23 victims filed suit, demanding $6 million in
compensation from Sumitomo for poisoning.
   A district court ruled in 1984 that as the owner, the company
was responsible for compensation whether it operated the mine or
not. It ordered Sumitomo to pay $4.3 million and a high court
upheld that ruling in 1988.
   Another group of 18 filed suit in 1984 and the previous rulings
were upheld again in March this year. Nine of those 18 have died.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
defying expectations for a lower opening.
   Many analysts had predicted a soybean-led decline based on a
large number of delivery notices posted this morning against the
November soybean contract.
   Today is frst notice day for the November contract, the first
opportunity for players to declare intentions to deliver soybeans.
A large number of delivery notices indicates near-term supplies are
adequate.
   But instead of lower, soybeans opened moderately higher on
speculative buying, which lent support to the corn and wheat
markets.
   Corn futures also were underpinned by persistent rumors of
Soviet buying interest.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to 1 cent

   Bendix Field Engineering Corp. said
Wednesday that it was laying off 300 workers because most of the
equipment the company maintains locally for the U.S. Marines has
been shipped to the Middle East.
   The company said the workers would be recalled as soon as the
equipment is returned or replaced.
   Bendix maintains 13 combat-loaded ships and their cargo at its
Blount Island operation. Nine were deployed to the Middle East as
part of Operation Desert Shield and four others are not due for
maintenance until November 1991.
   The ships and their cargo of tanks, trucks and other equipment
are kept ready for emergency deployment.

   The dollar finished lower against most currencies
in European trading today but gained against the yen.
   Gold was higher.
   Though the dollar largely lost ground in Europe it remained
relatively steady against the British pound, which was under
pressure from talk of an imminent cut in a key British interest
rate. Dealers said worries about Persian Gulf developments
supported the dollar against the yen.
   Late this afternoon in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.5150
German marks, down from 1.5190 marks late Tuesday. In midday New
York trading the dollar fetched 1.5161 marks.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.35 yen, up 0.35 yen from
Tuesday's finish. Later in London, it was quoted at 129.90 yen. At
midday in New York, the dollar bought 129.675 yen.
   Other European dollar rates compared with late Tuesday: 1.2850

<HEAD>Say Gulf War Could Triple Oil Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of oil could easily ``explode'' to
$100 per barrel if war broke out in the Persian Gulf, a panel of
experts told a Senate committee Wednesday.
   ``There's no limit,'' said John Lichtblau of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation. ``It depends on how much panic there
is.''
   With the Bush administration rattling sabres in Iraq's
direction, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., presiding over a hearing
of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, echoed growing
concern in Congress about what will happen at the pump if war
breaks out.
   ``The day the war starts prices will explode,'' said Lichtblau,
one of several experts on the oil industry to appear before the
panel.
   Oil prices hovering in the $33 per barrel range could easily
triple, said Professor Fariborz Ghadar of George Washington
University's business school. ``I would not be surprised if oil
prices reached $100 per barrel,'' Ghadar said.
   Translating a crude oil price increase into a higher price at
the pump is an inexact science. But some industry experts use a
ratio of 12 cents more per gallon for every $5 increase in the
price of a barrel of crude.
   At $100 per barrel, under that formula, gasoline could rise to
nearly $3 per gallon.
   The witnesses told Lieberman that with oil production already at
or near capacity, oil consuming states could do little beyond
releasing oil reserves onto the market.
   Tapping oil reserves would have to go beyond the use of the U.S.
government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said Professor M.A.
Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It would have
to occur globally.
   In addition to the strategic reserves there are the oil reserves
held by private companies as well as substantial reserves held by
Japan and western European nations, witnesses said.
   The reasons for the sharp price rise, the experts said, would be
fear that war would disrupt supply lines combined with the
likelihood that a Gulf war would curtail Saudi Arabia's
oil-producing capabilities.
   Conversely, if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein suddenly ends the
crisis by withdrawing forces from Kuwait, the price of oil could
drop just as suddenly to levels below those that preceded the Aug.
2 invasion Iraqi, witnesses said.
   ``That range is likely to be reached approximately 48 hours
after the crisis is over,'' Lichtblau said.
   If the stalemate continues it is likely that oil prices will
remain about where they are. But they could jump quickly with any
disruption of a supply system already straining to meet demand.
   ``This is a very tight market,'' Ghadar said. ``A pipe blowing
up in Nigeria, a fire in Venezuela, some other disruption,'' could
be enough to spread panic and push prices higher.
   In the second of three hearings on the oil industry, Lieberman
continued to pursue the question of whether oil companies and oil
producing nations are unfairly gouging consumers.
   ``In the past few months there has been an enormous transfer of
wealth from the many oil consuming nations, including the United
States, to the few oil producing nations,'' Lieberman said. Saudi
Arabia alone would reap a $50 billion windfall if oil averaged $30
per barrel over the course of a year.
   The answers Lieberman received were not encouraging to
consumers. The witnesses said there was little the United States
could do to break up the OPEC cartel. In the meantime, the simple
laws of supply and demand would govern the price of oil.
   Witnesses rejected as unworkable, for example, Lieberman's
suggestion that Saudi Arabia unilaterally lower the price of its
crude in exchange for U.S. military support. The market would
quickly absorb the cheap Saudi oil and no other countries would be
compelled to lower their prices, Lichtblau said.

   In addition, mortgage applications nationwide have fallen about
20 percent from the peak summer months. Although part of that is
seasonal, Wynn blames sluggish economic conditions or prolonged
worries about a recession.
   ``People who may have had an interest in buying a house are just
walking away,'' he said.
   Many are opting to renovate the homes they already have. That
has helped builders and carpenters like 50-year-old Gonzalez keep
busy as the rate of new commercial and residential building
declines.
   Still, Gonzalez has tightened his belt. ``I don't go out that
much. I can't afford it. I can't buy the running shoes I want. I go
to Kmart ... seven dollars,'' Gonzalez said.
   The Northeast is among the hardest hit. Big layoffs on Wall
Street and in New England's high-tech corridor have contributed to
a plunge in real estate values and sales. That translates into less
demand for appliances, furniture and other home incidentals.
   Even in the Pacific Northwest, one of the economically strongest
regions, the rate of home sales and home appreciation has slowed.
Wes Lynch, spokesman for the Washington State Association of
Realtors, said Seattle area homes that once sold within weeks now
languish on the market for up to half a year.
   ``I suspect a lot of Washingtonians are waiting for the other
shoe to drop,'' said Lynch, referring to uncertainties posed by the
Persian Gulf ordeal and the new federal budget.
   Both those situations have helped drive up interest rates,
although the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, has
signaled its intention to ease credit.
   Higher rates curtail consumer spending because they make
borrowing more expensive. Rates on 30-year conventional mortgages
have risen to an average 10.12 percent in October from 9.81 percent
four months ago.
   Some economists argue that part of the sluggishness around the
country can be traced to the changing nature of the population.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said this change is particularly acute among members of the
free-spending postwar generation now getting into a more
financially conservative middle age.
   ``Most baby boomers have almost every material good known to
mankind. (But) people in their late 30s and early 40s are no longer
speculating in real estate and buying expensive foreign cars,'' he
said. ``I think they're more selective in their purchases.''
   That's true for Mrs. DeLessio, a 29-year-old insurance claims
representative on maternity leave.
   ``We started cutting coupons, watching sales. We wanted to get a
new dining room set but we've postponed it until after Christmas.
We've been making an effort to save more,'' said Mrs. DeLessio,
with annual family income of around $60,000.
   Ironically, if more consumers behaved like Mrs. Delessio, her
husband, Philip, could be out work. He's a 33-year-old sales
representative for a leather goods wholesaler who's largely
dependent on the health of the nation's retailers.
   ``When the economy is bad they may not want to buy his
products,'' Mrs. DeLessio said.
   Dillon, who sells medical equipment and earns $175,000 a year
before taxes, has swum against the economic tide before. The Rocky
Mountain region in which he does business never prospered like the
Northeast or West Coast during the '80s. Although conditions have
stabilized, he faces new challenges, like filling his car with
gasoline without losing money.
   ``My travel costs have damn near doubled but my commissions
haven't,'' the 49-year-old Dillon said, adding that he's doing more
business by phone and has dropped marginally profitable clients.
   At the same time, Dillon said, he's tried to invest more in his
company by upgrading the phone and computer systems. ``You've got
to stand out among the crowd, especially in times of economic
trouble.''
   California financial planner and psychologist Felton-Collins
agreed: ``This is an ideal time to look at where you stand
financially, what your goals are and what steps you can take to
improve yourself.''
   There are other opportunities as well.
   ``If you're in a steady profession ... and you don't anticipate
this type of a situation would hurt you, now might be the best time
in the world to buy some of the things you've been thinking of
buying,'' Badders of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit
said. ``There are some good buys in homes, probably autos.''
   Others see possibilities in the stock market, which also has
taken a beating this year. Some of the stocks favored by investment
counselors include drug companies and the ``blue chips,'' or
big-name issues with the greatest long-term returns.
   ``Stocks will continue to grow. In the next five to 10 years the
Dow (Jones industrial average) will probably hit 5,000,'' said Lenn
Width, a retired lumberyard owner from Lynwood, Wash., who belongs
to an investment club that has played the stock market for years.
   Even though Width estimates losing about a quarter of his
$500,000 stock portfolio over the past several months, he
maintains, ``There are thousands of bargains. If you got any money
this is the time to be investing.''

<HEAD>Toys R Us Reports Sluggish Sales After Iraqi Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toys R Us Inc. reported sluggish third-quarter
sales Wednesday, an indication that toy stores suffered the same
drop-off in business as other retailers because of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Toys R Us said sales from stores open at least a year rose 1.6
percent in the quarter ended Oct. 28, while overall sales were up
14.8 percent. Retail industry analysts believe sales from stores
open a year or more give a more accurate picture of a retailer's
performance.
   The company said its results, which it attributed to the
difficult retail environment, were down from the first half of the
year.
   Retail sales - which were already shaky because of a weakening
economy - slowed markedly after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Many economists say the Middle East crisis has undermined
consumers' sense of security, and it has also left them with less
money to spend on extras like toys because of rising energy prices.
   Retailers are expected to have a difficult Christmas season
because consumers are certain to spend more cautiously this year
than in previous holiday seasons.
   Toy retailers are likely to fare somewhat better than apparel or
general retailers as parents may forgo gifts for adults in favor of
spending more on children. However, the Toys R Us sales figures
indicate that toy retailers may not be immune from the
uncertainties expected to plague the overall industry this year.
   The Christmas season is crucial to all retailers, because they
generally make half their annual sales and earnings at that time.
Many retailers are keeping their inventories low and slashing their
expenses in hopes of holding on to their profits.

   The International Energy Agency reported Wednesday
that threats of oil shortages due to the Persian Gulf crisis are
easing as OPEC countries boost output and industrial nations cut
demand.
   In a report made public as delegates from the organization met
privately, the IEA predicted the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will produce 22.6 million barrels of oil per
day in the last quarter of 1990.
   This would be a slight increase over 21.9 million barrels in the
third quarter.
   IEA Chairman Ulrich Engelmann told reporters after the meeting
that the situation is ``somewhat easier than anticipated.''
   Nonetheless, he said, ``if something happens, there isn't any
flexibility in the supply situation.''
   Engelmann described the meeting as routine and said the
delegates devoted most of their time to planning next year's
budget.
   The report said total fourth-quarter world oil supplies among
nations outside the former communist bloc should total 53.4 million
barrels per day, up 400,000 barrels from the third quarter.
   Consumption in the 21 industrial countries making up the IEA,
founded in 1973to plan strategy for energy crises, should fall by
800,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, it said.
   The latest estimates suggest a better balance in oil supply and
demand than the IEA thought at its last meeting in September,
according to the report.
   The reasons are falling demand, a moderate third-quarter buildup
of OPEC stocks, and increased output by OPEC members to make up for
the 4.5 million barrels per day lost to world markets by the U.N.
embargo of Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``There isn't any shortage of supply in oil product markets,''
said IEA Executive Director Helga Steeg.
   Industrial countries will need to draw on a bit less than 1
million barrels of oil a day from commercial reserves after New
Year's to keep the figures in balance, the report said.
   ``Short of any demand restraint and draw of government
controlled stocks, the draw of commercial stocks is practically the
only possible response left to cope with unforeseen demand surges
or supply disruptions,'' it said.
   The IEA urged members to keep their strategic petroleum reserves
as high as possible and warned that the oil market remains
vulnerable to disruption.
   Saudi Arabia, the main staging point for the U.S.-led
multinational forces arrayed against Iraq in the Gulf, has boosted
production to 8 million barrels per day to help make up the
shortfall caused by the embargo.
   The IEA said Saudi Arabia could keep output at that level but
probably not increase it much. A spell of cold weather in northern
countries this winter could drive up prices.

   The small business community's economic mood
this year took the steepest drop since the recession year 1982, Dun
&amp; Bradstreet Corp. said in an annual survey released Wednesday.
   The survey of 5,000 small businesses found that 23 percent are
pessimistic about their economic prospects over the next 12 to 18
months, rising sharply from 13 percent reporting pessimism in 1989.
   The survey's finding is significant because the mood index has
closely matched shifts in economic growth these past 10 years,
marching ``together in virtual lockstep,'' said Patricia W.
Hamilton, editor of D&amp;B Reports, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's magazine for
small business which conducted the survey.
   Roughly 68 percent of respondents said inflation would rise in
the coming year, while only 3 percent thought it would decline and
17 percent said it would remain about the same.
   Survey respondents also expressed anxiety over interest rates,
with 47 percent predicting that rates would rise in the coming
year, and only 9 percent saying they would fall.
   Chief worries among small businesses were, in order of
importance: cash-flow squeeze, controlling costs, finding skilled
employees, cost of liability insurance and the prospect of
recesssion.
   The survey showed recession was at the top of the list for
small-company owners in troubled New England and worker-hiring
problems were the foremost concern for the relatively strong West
Coast economy.
   Despite worries, small business owners and presidents generally
continue to be a relatively optimistic group compared with other
key economic groups, with 59 percent of respondents calling
themselves optimists about the economy, the survey found. That
figure, however, was down from 67 percent a year ago.
   For the second year in a row, health-care costs continued to
chill businesses, with four out of five respondents telling the
magazine that their costs had increased more than 10 percent in the
past year - with some reporting increases of more than 50 percent.
   The D&amp;B Reports survey, completed Oct. 15, was mailed to
presidents and owners of 5,000 randomly selected small businesses
with sales under $12 million.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet, based in New York, is a leading world marketer
of business information and services.

channel and the construction risk is perceived as hugely reduced,''
Alastair Morton, deputy chairman of the Anglo-French consortium
Eurotunnel PLC, said by telephone.
   ``Everything is in place now for completion of the project'' in
1993, he said.
   Diggers working from the English side in one of the three
tunnels punched a 2-inch hole through to the French side Tuesday
night, three years after work began on the world's largest current
civil engineering project.
   The breakthrough came on the service tunnel, the smallest of
three bores, and it will be two months before that tunnel reaches
its full 15.7-foot diameter. The first of the two 31-mile rail
tunnels between Folkestone and the French port of Calais is
expected to be linked up next year.
   Eurotunnel timed a new share offering, intended to raise $1.03
billion to coincide with the breakthrough, Morton said.
   The success of the share sale is a condition for the release of
an additional $3.9 billion in loans from banks, which already have
put up $9.8 billion.
   Investors already have bought $1.94 billion of Eurotunnel stock.
   The tunnel now is estimated to cost $14.9 billion, up 57 percent
from the initial estimate of $9.4 billion in 1986.
   Eurotunnel is expected to open in June 1993 and carry
passengers, cars and freight between London and Paris in three
hours. It expects to carry 28 million passengers in the first year.
   Morton said he was confident the share sale would succeed even
though it was taking place just before the government plans to sell
$7.8 billion worth of stock in Britain's electricity industry.
   The giant stock sales are being launched in a stock market that
has been jittery because of the slowing British economy and the
Middle East crisis. Many investors have been sitting on the
sidelines and trading volume has been low.
   Morton noted the Eurotunnel sale already has been underwritten
by investment firms, and expressed confidence that investors have
plenty of cash on hand.
   The project has no government support, and Eurotunnel has said
it doesn't expect to pay dividends for years. However, the stock
offering includes inducements such as travel discounts.
   Confidence in Eurotunnel has been shaken in the past by
overruns, cost disputes with contractors and management shakeups.
   Eurotunnel shares were offered at $6.79 in 1987, and rose as
high as $14.22 this year. They fell 6 cents to close at $9.51 on
London's Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

   Soybean futures prices closed slightly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after bouncing off
three-month lows in trading dominated by grain dealers. Corn and
wheat futures retreated.
   The soybean market opened stronger, then fell as commercial
players sold heavily following an unusually large number of
delivery notices posted against the November contract.
   Wednesday was first notice day for the November soybean
contract, the first day for traders to indicate their intentions to
deliver soybeans to those holding obligations to take delivery.
   Analysts said speculators absorbed most of the commercial
selling, then gladly sold many of those contracts back to the
commercial players toward the end of the session to avoid getting
stuck with physical deliveries.
   The commercial buying interest surfaced when the November
contract dropped below $5.90 to $5.89 a bushel, its lowest price
since Aug. 3.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 2{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.61} a bushel; corn was
1} cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.29{ a bushel;
oats were \ cent to 1 cent higher with December at $1.21\ a bushel;

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing today
as traders kept a close watch on oil prices.
   Analysts said stocks drew some tentative support from a drop in
oil prices as the session began. By midafternoon, however, oil had
recovered its early losses.
   In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new
factory orders rose 0.1 percent in September. Excluding oil,
however, the total showed a 1.1 percent decline.
   On Tuesday the government reported a stronger-than-expected gain
in the gross national product, at a 1.8 percent annual rate after
adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   But brokers said that failed to convince most market
participants that the business outlook had improved to any
significant extent.

   Congress and the White House have once again
postponed the date by which the federal deficit must be eliminated.
   But in their latest change in the budget law, they have included
something new that is drawing raves from some fiscal experts: tight
spending controls.
   ``We never before have had effective expenditure controls,''
Carol Cox, president of the watchdog Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget, said Wednesday. ``That is incredible progress.''
   Under the original 1985 version of the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law, the federal shortfall was supposed to be
eliminated this year. When the law was changed in 1987, the target
date was pushed back to fiscal 1993.
   Neither goal is attainable. The deficit for the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 was $220.4 billion, the second highest total ever.
This year's gap is projected to exceed $250 billion - a record -
even with the giant deficit-reduction bill Congress passed last
Saturday.
   But that same measure contained extensive changes in the budget
process that de-emphasizes the law's focus on reaching specified
deficit targets.
   Instead, it groups many kinds of federal spending into three
separate categories - domestic, defense, and foreign affairs - and
puts a spending cap on each of them.
   If the cap is exceeded, most programs in that category would be
slashed by an amount equal to the excess spending - a powerful
incentive to not go beyond the limit.
   The creation of the three separate categories is important for
another reason: it prevents lawmakers from increasing domestic
spending by cutting military programs. This satisfies the Bush
administration, which has been eager to prevent the
Democratic-controlled Congress from slashing the Pentagon's budget
so it could beef up social programs.
   ``They know ... we're not going to cut money in one area and
switch it to another,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
   The three categories will be combined into one in 1994.
   Other controls have been put on the fastest-growing category of
spending, benefit programs such as Medicare and Social Security.
These programs will be allowed to grow with inflation and as the
population increases, but any expansion in benefits would have to
be balanced by an equal cut somewhere else.
   Some critics of the new law have argued that it shifts
congressional budget power to the White House. That is because the
executive branch will have the power to decide which programs are
assigned to each spending category, and how deep required spending
cuts will have to be.
   But others argue tat under the old law, the administration
already had the final word on how deep spending slashes would have
to be if deficits exceeded the ceilings the law set for them.
   Other changes in the budget law include:
   - Deficit targets in the old law were fixed. Under the new law,
the targets will be adjusted to reflect changes in the economy.
Since economic fluctuations have dramatic effects on government tax
collections and spending, this makes the target much more
attainable.
   - Some spending, such as Operation Desert Shield and the bailout
of the savings and loan industry, will not be counted against the
deficit target. Those items were included under the old law. For
the first time, emergencies - such as funds to clean up after
hurricanes - will also not be counted.

   The final issue of Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Runways
magazine will be published Monday, ending an eight-month experiment
due to a soft advertising market, the publisher said.
   The magazine was envisioned as a weekly aimed at businesses and
workers around major airports. Runways Southern California, the
original product, focused on airports from San Diego to Santa
Barbara.
   With circulation of more than 33,000, the magazine drew readers
but failed to attract advertising from the aerospace industry,
which was cutting back due to military spending cuts.
   ``We just weren't making it,'' said publisher Larry Birger, a
former Miami Herald business section editor.
   Runways converted to a twice-monthly publication and laid off
five employees in July. It expanded its focus to the West Coast in
September, forcing it to compete more directly with
well-established trade publications.
   With the magazine's shutdown, 17 staff members will be laid off
with eight weeks' severance pay.

   The Treasury plans to borrow a quarterly
record $34.25 billion from the public next week in a series of debt
auctions to replenish the government's coffers, officials said
Wednesday.
   ``We are offering $34.25 billion of notes and bonds to refund
$23.5 billion of privately held notes maturing on Nov. 15 and to
raise approximately $10.73 billion of cash,'' Assistant Secretary
Jay Powell told a news conference.
   The borrowing would surpass the previous record of $32.25
billion in notes and bonds sold last August.
   Powell said the auctions next week would include:
   - $12.5 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be sold on Tuesday.
   - $11.0 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday.
   - $10.75 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be offered on Thursday.
   In addition, the Treasury will auction on Thursday $12 billion
in 161-day cash management bills in minimum denominations of
$10,000.

   Oil prices rallied late Wednesday to move above
$35 per barrel in a third straight erratic trading session that
largely ignored news on the Persian Gulf standoff.
   Light sweet crude oil had been down about $1 per barrel in early
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but a surge in the
afternoon pushed it up by about $2 from the morning lows. Crude
settled at $35.23 per barrel, up 69 cents for the day, on contracts
for delivery in December.
   All later contract months closed higher in a market that stayed
about as sluggish as the two previous lackluster sessions.
   ``Compared to normal changes, it's a wimp today,'' said Philip
L. Dodge, an oil analyst with Nomura Securities International Inc.
``There hasn't been anything to signal that we're closer to war or
peace. It just gets caught in the middle.''
   There was no dominant news moving the market, although some of
the move down was attributed to conciliatory remarks from Iraq and
some of the move up was attributed to war rhetoric from the United
States and Britain.
   Energy analyst Thomas Blakeslee of Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc., in Hoboken, N.J., said the late rally came as floor traders
who had agreed to sell oil early in the day found they had bet the
wrong way as oil refused to drop. They then bought crude-oil
contracts to avoid losing more money and the price went up.
   ``On the close, the market took off,'' Blakeslee said. ``You
found locals caught on the wrong side. As it turned positive,
locals realized this market had no oomph to the down side.''
   Future contracts for refined petroleum products also seemed to
fluctuate with little sense of direction.
   Home heating oil closed 1.63 cents lower at 89.54 cents a gallon
on November contracts. January and December contracts fell, but
more distant months moved higher for the day.
   Unleaded gasoline contracts were all higher at the close, with
November delivery up 2.71 cents to 96.44 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas prices were also mixed. December delivery contracts
fell 4.8 cents to $2.36 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEAD>Machinists Hold Rare Vote; Recommend Rejecting Boeing Drug Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union machinists at The Boeing Co. will cast an
unusual mid-contract vote in November on whether to accept the
company's new program for dealing with drug and alcohol abuse.
   Leaders of the Machinists union here recommend their 40,000
members at Boeing vote the proposal down, saying it fosters ``a
police-state mentality.''
   Machinists' leaders say the plan punishes people seeking
treatment for substance abuse. Boeing officials say the union wants
too much of a hand in what should be a company-run program.
   The Machinists struck Boeing last year for 48 days before a new
three-year contract was approved Nov. 20. Union officials say there
won't be a strike if the plan is rejected, but legal action is
possible if Boeing tries to impose it unilaterally.
   Bob De Lappe, corporate director of personnel, said the vote was
the first to be held by Machinists in mid-contract in the 38 years
he has been with Boeing.
   Jack Daniels, spokesman for District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said
members of the four Seattle-area locals at Boeing would vote at
meetings on Thursday and Nov. 7, 8 and 14. Results won't be
released until the 15th, he said.
   Boeing machinists elsewhere, including large contingents in
Wichita, Kan., and Portland, Ore., also will vote on the proposal,
Daniels said, at meetings scheduled by local lodges.
   De Lappe said the new policy, which would cover all of Boeing's
approximately 150,000 U.S. employees, is ``a total shift from
punitive action to rehabilitative action.''
   In the past, he said, employees caught with or using drugs on
company property were fired. The new plan would offer them a second
chance if they agree to undergo treatment.
   Boeing negotiated with Machinists over the new drug policy in
late August, September and early October, Daniels said.
   It continues to negotiate with the United Auto Workers, which
represents production workers at the Boeing Helicopter plant in
Philadelphia. The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, which represents Boeing engineers and technicians, has
approved the plan.
   Boeing's new policy comes as the U.S. Department of
Transportation is requiring stiffer substance abuse policies,
including random drug testing, for some aircraft workers.
   About 3,100 Boeing workers, including drivers, flight crews,
ground-school instructors and employees working on certain aircraft
will be subject to the random tests under the federal rules.
   Boeing also plans testing when there is reasonable suspicion of
alcohol or drug possession or use, and after serious accidents or
safety violations. Individuals who go through a treatment program
also would be subject to tests.
   Workers who come to Boeing's Employee Assistance Program for
help with a drinking or drug problem will be referred to an outside
rehabilitation program, De Lappe said. If the testing finds they've
been backsliding, they will be given one more chance.
   People found possessing or under the influence of drugs or
alcohol can go through rehabilitation, but won't be given a second
chance if they again test positive, De Lappe said.
   As in the past, anyone caught selling drugs on company property
will be fired.
   Boeing has launched an extensive in-house education campaign
about the new policy. It also is training supervisors how to
recognize drug and alcohol problems.
   ``Socially, we think it's the right thing to do,'' De Lappe
said. ``We have a major drug problem in the community and we think
this may be one way to address it in a positive manner.''
   The policy makes financial sense because ``it's cheaper to
rehabilitate people than to hire new ones,'' he said.
   But in a letter to union members, District Lodge 751 President
Tom Baker said there aren't enough safeguards in Boeing's plan
against arbitrary decisions or harassment.
   ``The Boeing-proposed program is a company program - by, for,
and to the benefit of the company,'' he says. ``It uses a
police-state mentality and threats of termination - even against
those who voluntarily seek help.''

<HEAD>Polaroid Fine Gives Kodak Third Quarter Loss</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $909.5 million patent infringement
judgment against Eastman Kodak Co. resulted in a $206 million third
quarter loss for the photographic company.
   Kodak said Wednesday its earnings would have increased 19
percent for the quarter without the judgment.
   The loss, which translated to 64 cents per share, compared with
earnings of $300 million, or 93 cents per share, in the third
quarter of 1989. Without the charge, earnings for the third quarter
of 1990 would have been $358 million, or $1.10 per share.
   Kodak was ordered by a U.S. District Court judge in Boston
earlier this month to pay Polaroid $909.5 million in a 14-year-old
patent infringement suit over Kodak's sales of instant cameras and
film.
   ``While no money has yet changed hands, and the litigation has
yet to be finally resolved, this charge to earnings is appropriate
at this time,'' Kodak Chairman Kay Whitmore said in a statement.
   Sales increased 5 percent for the quarter to $4.77 billion, vs.
$4.54 billion in the same quarter last year.
   ``The results were pretty much in line with expectations,'' said
Peter Enderlin, an industry analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co. in New York. ``Sales were a little disappointing but the
margins were excellent.''
   Kodak benefited from a favorable foreign exchange rate and
improvements in productivity gains, Enderlin said.
   The company posted gains in its imaging, chemicals and health
segments. The only disappointment was the information segment,
which includes Kodak's copier and business operations, where sales
dropped 2.9 percent for the quarter.
   ``I think top management is beginning to lose patience,''
Enderlin said. ``There may be some fairly drastic steps taken with
some pieces of that segment if they don't show tangible gains by
the middle of next year.''
   Earnings for the first three quarters of 1990 were $377 million,
or $1.16 per share, down 36 percent from $589 million, or $1.82 per
share, in 1989. Without the Polaroid charge, earnings would have
been up 60 percent to $941 million.
   Kodak last showed a loss in the fourth quarter of 1989, when the
company took a charge of $273 million to pay for a restructuring
program in which 7,500 jobs were cut and about 20 businesses were
sold or consolidated. That restructuring was announced following
depressed earnings in the first three quarters of 1989.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises in NY After Falling Overseas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced against most major foreign
currencies in domestic trading Wednesday after generally finishing
lower abroad.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Analysts said there was no one force driving the foreign
exchange market, but a variety of factors affected the dollar's
performance against specific currencies.
   Mike Faust, a currency analyst with Money Market Services in
Chicago, said the dollar gained ground against the German mark on
speculation that the Bundesbank, the German central bank, might
lower interest rates.
   Lower interest rates reduce a currency's attractiveness because
investments denominated in that currency earn less.
   The dollar rose to 1.5185 marks in New York from late Tuesday's
1.51485. In earlier European trading, the dollar was quoted at
1.5150 marks, down from 1.5190 late Tuesday.
   The British pound was also shaken by talk of interest rate cuts.
Sterling fell to $1.9430 in New York from late Tuesday's $1.9565.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9440, compared with
$1.9485 late Tuesday.
   Faust said the market expected the British government to lower
rates by as much as half a percentage point.
   The dollar had its best showing against the Japanese yen, which
was hurt by pessimism over the Persian Gulf crisis. The Japanese
economy is seen as particularly vulnerable should there be a
disruption of energy supplies from the Middle East, as the country
imports 99 percent of its crude oil.
   In New York, the dollar rose to 130.105 yen from 128.725 yen
late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 129.35 yen,
up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's finish, and in London, it was quoted at
129.90 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.2865 Swiss francs, up from 1.2825;
5.0855 French francs, up from 5.0695; 1,138.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,134.25; and 1.16675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16775.
   Other European dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.2850 Swiss francs, down from 1.2890; 5.0725
French francs, down from 5.0845; 1.7070 Dutch guilders, down from
1.7120; 1,135.50 Italian lire, down from 1,137.75; and 1.1669
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1668
   Gold fell 30 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $379.40 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York
later quoted a bid of $379.30 a troy ounce, up 80 cents from
Tuesday.
   Gold traded in London at $379.75 bid per troy ounce, up from
$375.50 Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $379.25, up from
$373.40 late Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $4.96 an ounce to close at $379.61.
   Silver fell in New York, dropping 6.4 cents to close at $4.153
on the Commodity Exchange. Earlier, silver traded in London at a
bid price of $4.22 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $4.16.

<HEAD>Houses Become More Affordable In September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising incomes and declining home prices
boosted the typical American family's ability to buy an existing
house in September to its highest level in nearly two years, a real
estate trade group said Wednesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its housing
affordability index rose to 110.9 in September from 107.5 in
August. That meant a family with a median income of $35,239 had
110.9 percent of the income needed to qualify for conventional
financing to buy a median-priced home costing $94,300.
   The median income was $35,125 in August, while the median price
of a home was $97,100, the Realtors said.
   The index was at its highest level since a 111.2 reading in
December 1988.
   The median means half of the families earn more and half less,
or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less.
   ``A decline in the median home price in September had the
biggest positive impact on the index reading last month,'' Realtors
President Norman D. Flynn said. ``However, the decline failed to
bring more buyers into the market, as evidenced by an 8 percent
drop in existing-home sales last month.''
   The interest rate used to compute the affordability index is a
composite of closing rates for both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate
mortgages on existing homes as reported by the Federal Housing
Finance Board. It rose from 9.98 percent in August to 10.00 percent
in September.
   Changes in the median home price, median family income and
average mortgage rate resulted in a $19 decrease in the monthly
mortgage payment to $662 in September.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Bounce Off 3-Month Lows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rebounded from three-month lows Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in what amounted to a market maneuver
by grain dealers to transfer some of their storage costs to
speculators.
   On other commodity markets, corn and soybean futures retreated;
oil futures were mixed; precious metals were mixed; and livestock
and meat futures rose.
   Soybean futures settled { cent lower to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in November at $5.92 a bushel.
   The November contract fell as low as $5.89 a bushel, its lowest
level since Aug. 3, before bouncing back late in the session.
   Analysts said commercial players profited from the day's action,
which began with an unusually large number of delivery notices
posted against the November contract.
   Wednesday was first notice day, or the first day for players
holding ``short'' positions in the November contract to indicate to
the exchange their intention to settle those sale agreements
through physical delivery of soybeans rather than by taking
offsetting market positions.
   On the Board of Trade, traders post delivery notices by handing
over to the exchange clearinghouse their receipts for soybeans
stored in exchange-approved warehouses.
   As the receipts come in, the clearinghouse matches them with
traders holding obligations to buy soybeans, beginning with the
oldest ``long'' position.
   The holder of a receipt is considered the owner of the soybeans
and is obliged to pay the storage costs.
   Analysts said virtually all of Wednesday's delivery notices were
posted by commercial grain dealers and most of the receipts were
transferred to speculators, most of whom have no interest in owning
soybeans.
   The speculators overwhelmingly refused delivery by selling
November futures contracts to offset their market positions. The
buyers of those contracts, late in the session, were mainly the
commercial players who posted the delivery notices, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, the warehouse receipts bounced from speculator to
speculator and will eventually find their way back to the
commercial participants.
   Thus, many commercials were able to temporarily avoid storage
costs for soybeans. The most successful commercials also managed to
effectively sell soybeans, then buy them back at a lower price.
   ``It was just like a gravy train,'' said William Biedermann,
research director with the commodities brokerage Allendale Inc.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.62 a bushel; corn was 1}
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.29\ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1 cent higher with December at $1.21\ a bushel.
   Crude oil prices rallied above $35 a barrel late in the session
on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a third straight day of
erratic trading that largely ignored news on the Persian Gulf
standoff.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 64 cents to 69 cents higher with
December at $35.23 a barrel; heating oil was 1.63 cents lower to
.03 cent higher with November at 89.54 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.2 cents to 2.71 cents higher with November at 96.44
cents a gallon.
   The gold and silver markets ignored the oil rally and closed
lower on New York's Commodity Exchange. Platinum futures rose
slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange, extending Tuesday's
powerful gains.
   Gold finished 40 cents lower across the board with December at
$381.30 a troy ounce; silver was 6.3 cents to 6.5 cents lower with
November at $4.153 a troy ounce; platinum settled $1.40 higher
across the board with January at $438.40 a troy ounce.
   Higher cash cattle prices boosted cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Pork prices firmed amid expectations that cash
markets will strengthen soon.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .45 cent higher with December at
77.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .68 cent higher
with November at 87.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with December at 51.77 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .70 cent to .95 cent higher with February at
61.25 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Wendy's Profits Up 45 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendy's International Inc. profits increased
by 45 percent for the third quarter, partly because of improved
company operations, menu additions and advertising featuring
founder David Thomas, the fast-food company said Wednesday.
   Earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 totaled $12.7 million,
or 13 cents per share, vs. $8.7 million, or 9 cents a share, for
the same period last year.
   Revenues for the quarter totaled $257.5 million, compared with
$269.2 million a year ago. The company said Wendy's had 74 fewer
company-operated restaurants than last year. Most were sold to
franchise owners.
   James W. Near, chief executive officer, president and chief
operating officer, said the improved performance was partly the
result of ``healthy new choices'' on the menu, such as a grilled
chicken sandwich. He also noted that the restaurants converted to
french fries cooked in all-vegetable oil instead of animal oil.
   He said nationwide television advertising featuring Thomas
lifted awareness of Wendy's to the highest level in four years.
   There were 3,726 Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants
worldwide at the end of the quarter, including 1,069 operated by
the company.
   For the nine months, Wendy's earned $31.52 million or 33 cents a
share, vs. $24.67 million or 26 cents a share a year earlier.
Revenues totaled $761.35 million vs. $808.59 million.

<HEAD>Government Claims Milken Guilty of Additional Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK (AP)- In a final bid to persuade a judge to give
Michael Milken a long prison term, prosecutors claimed Thursday the
junk-bond financier committed ``serious'' crimes beyond those he
has admitted.
   The government said in a closing statement that it
``conclusively'' proved at a special hearing that Milken broke the
law during three transactions, despite scant hard evidence
presented in testimony.
   On Wednesday, the defense said the government had failed to
prove its case and that Milken should be sentenced only on the six
felony counts to which he pleaded guilty in April.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood has not yet set a sentencing
date, but it is expected to take place next week. Milken faces a
maximum 28 years in prison. He already has agreed to pay $600
million in penalties.
   In its 40-page memorandum, prosecutors maintained that evidence
presented at the eight-day hearing ``establishes that Michael
Milken committed serious crimes in addition to his admitted
crimes.''
   It said the evidence also ``strongly refutes Milken's claims
that his crimes were isolated, largely motiveless and committed
reluctantly and at the behest of others.''
   As in earlier court papers, the government claimed Milken
directed a crime spree to consolidate his market power and for his
personal gain.
   The judge will weigh the closing arguments along with the
testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, which she called
to gain insight into Milken's professional character.
   Despite the government's strong language, testimony appeared to
fall short of clearly linking Milken to allegations of stock
manipulation in Wickes Cos., bribery and misappropriation of Storer
Communications Inc. securities and insider trading in Caesars World
Inc.
   It did offer suggestions that Milken's criminal behavior may
have extended beyond the narrow charges to which he pleaded guilty.
Testimony also presented vivid descriptions of shady behavior by
underlings at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., high-yield bond
department.
   Milken had been the main target of the government's Wall Street
probe from 1986, when he was named by inside trader Ivan Boesky.
   On Wickes, the government said ``the record is crystal clear''
that Milken ordered the company's stock manipulated upward in
concert with Boesky. A former Milken subordinate testified that
Milken shouted out a closing stock price, which he said amounted to
a call to manipulate the shares.
   No witness, though, said Milken directly ordered the
manipulation and the defense claimed the main witness lied.
   The government based its argument partly on an assertion that
Milken alone had the authority to use the Boesky organization for
illegal purposes. Several of the charges in Milken's guilty plea
involved lawbreaking with Boesky.
   The government also said Milken illegally offered gratuities to
favored clients and hoarded lucrative securities in a 1985 takeover
of Storer. It also said Milken deceived a major client and violated
Drexel policy in the deal.
   On insider trading, prosecutors said Milken knew Drexel's plans
to advise Caesars about a debt restructuring when he ordered
traders to buy the casino company's bonds in 1983. Testimony was
contradictory and did not establish a firm Milken tie.
   The government said Milken personally made $553,000 from the
insider trading, and that Drexel and a major client made additional
illegal profits.
   Finally, the government memo said that suggestive testimony
about possible obstruction of justice by Milken should be
considered as evidence of ``the pervasiveness of Milken's criminal
conduct.''
   At the hearing, witnesses described secret bathroom meetings and
hints to destroy evidence. The defense said Milken did not directly
order any Drexel employee to destroy papers, give false testimony
or obstruct investigators.

<HEAD>Trump Organization Says It Doesn't Know If It Will Make Interest
Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump raised new doubts about
his financial stability Wednesday by telling the American Stock
Exchange it was unclear whether he would make a big interest
payment on Taj Mahal casino bonds next month.
   Bob Shabazian, an exchange spokesman, said the Trump
Organization made the statement in response to a question from the
exchange, where the bonds are traded. Shabazian said Trump didn't
say whether the payment would be made or not.
   The spokesman said the exchange routinely asks companies before
their interest payments are due if they will meet their
obligations.
   The Trump Organization is supposed to pay $47 million in
interest on $675 million in Taj bonds Nov. 15.
   Stephen Bollenbach, the Trump Organization's chief financial
officer, was not in his office when a reporter called for comment
late Wednesday.
   The American Stock Exchange halted trading in the bonds
Wednesday while it made the request of Trump. Shabazian said
activity in the securities would resume Thursday, but he said they
would be trading on a flat basis, meaning they would no longer
accrue interest.
   The development signaled new investor skepticism about Trump,
who has been juggling his massive debt problems for months and has
been intensely negotiating with bondholders on a restructuring of
debts on the Taj Mahal, the glitziest of his three Atlantic City
casinos.
   Earlier this month, Trump unveiled a restructuring proposal, and
warned bondholders that the Taj Mahal might be forced into
bankruptcy court if the plan is turned down.
   The restructuring would give bondholders a nearly 20 percent
equity stake in the billion-dollar Taj Mahal in return for changes
in the terms of the junk bonds.
   The plan called for the interest rate on the bonds to be lowered
to 9 percent from their current 14 percent. It also calls for the
Nov. 15 payment to be met by issuing additional bonds.
   Some future interest payments would also be made with new bonds,
and the maturities of some issues would be extended under the plan.
   Wilbur Ross, a bondholder representative, rejected the plan,
saying the 19.9 equity stake was too low. Ross represents 10
institutions that hold about one-third of the Taj Mahal bonds.
   The Taj Mahal opened earlier this year but like other Atlantic
City casinos has been struggling in an uncertain economy. Trump has
been forced to negotiate with bondholders because his three casinos
- which also include Trump Castle and Trump Plaza - have been
unable to generate enough cash to pay all their bills.
   Earlier this year, the developer negotiated a $65 million bank
bailout that was supposed to give him breathing room to repay his
loans, which together are believed to total more than $3 billion.

<HEAD>Largest-Ever Cotton Sale Already Affecting Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cotton sale billed as the largest ever
comes at a time when cotton supplies worldwide already are tight,
industry observers said Wednesday.
   The sale of 500,000 bales to China was announced Tuesday by
Dunavant Enterprises Inc. of Memphis.
   The U.S. cotton industry expects total sales of 15 million bales
between Aug. 1, 1990, and July 1991. Of that total, sales abroad
are projected at 6.8 million bales.
   The Dunavant sale is the largest single cotton deal on record,
topping a 1984 sale when China bought 484,000 bales from Cargill
Inc., according to the National Cotton Council.
   The Dunavant sale, expected to be worth $200 million, was
negotiated over the past several weeks by representatives of
Dunavant Enterprises and Chinatex Cotton Import &amp; Export Corp. of
Beijing.
   Even before the sale was finished, the U.S. cotton market was
reacting to speculation of a major deal in the works, said Dean
Ethridge, a vice president of Sparks Commodities Inc. of Memphis.
   ``This has been talked about for weeks. I think to the extent
that anyone is surprised, it is to the size of the sale,'' he said.
   Cotton prices on spot and futures markets hovered around 75
cents a pound in the days just prior to the sale. Prices were under
72 a pound on Oct. 1.
   The Dunavant deal will add to market pressures expected to keep
cotton prices strong for the next nine months, Ethridge said.

<HEAD>On Eve of Senate Hearing, Price Goes Up For Oil Speculators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange announced steps
Wednesday that likely will drive out some oil speculators, on the
eve of a Senate inquiry into what critics have called reckless
gambling on oil in the futures market.
   Thehange, one of the world's key markets for petroleum, said
it would raise the amount of cash that must be put up by people who
buy and sell contracts for future delivery of crude oil, heating
oil and unleaded gasoline.
   Players in the market will have to put up two to three times as
much money as they did before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oil
prices skyrocketing.
   ``Basically, what that does is it takes a certain percentage of
speculators out of the market,'' said Thomas Blakeslee, an energy
analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. ``The
higher the margin, the more costly it is for a speculator to be
involved.''
   The move came just before a Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee hearing Thursday that will explore oil trading on the
Mercantile Exchange. The hearing was organized by Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn., who has called oil traders ``speculator
sharks'' and urged that they be required to put up more money.
   Mercantile Exchange President R. Patrick Thompson said Wednesday
evening that the exchange's move has nothing to do with Lieberman's
inquiry and is not intended to drive away speculators. Thompson
said there is little speculation taking place on the futures
market, with minimal effect on oil prices.
   He cited an exchange study, also released Wednesday, that
indicates more than 90 percent of trading on the exchange is done
by participants in the oil industry, who conceivably have oil
production or oil purchases that can be ``hedged'' against price
fluctuations by futures trading.
   Thompson said the exchange was raising its margins in order to
ensure participants will be able to pay cash to meet their
obligations, and that the higher margins were needed because of
increased volatility in recent days.
   ``In order to protect the financial integrity of the contracts,
it's appropriate to raise margins,'' Thompson said in a telephone
interview.
   Lieberman did not accept everything the exchange had to say.
   ``The timing is too coincidental for me not to feel some
satisfaction that we've influenced them,'' the senator said from
Washington. ``It does confirm the fears that I've expressed over
the last month or more that there was an irresistible temptation to
participate in a market which was rising as fast as the oil futures
market has been, when you could become a player with so little
money on the table.''
   The exchange's higher margins will take place in two steps after
the trading sessions on Friday and Tuesday. After the end of the
trading day Tuesday, customers who buy a contract for 1,000 barrels
of crude oil for next month delivery will have to put up $12,000,
or $14,000 during the last six days in which that contract is
traded.
   At current oil prices, that means a player would have to put up
a little less than a third of the contact's value.
   ``It remains to be seen whether that's adequate,'' Lieberman
said.
   The senator also questioned the Mercantile Exchange's method of
determining how much oil speculation is taking place.
   The exchange's numbers consider a market participant to be a
non-speculator if he or she is connected with the oil industry. The
only oil deals that are taken into account are those that are left
``open'' overnight, which would exclude any trades made by people
who get in and out of the market in the same day.
   ``A lot of those that I would consider speculators are closing
their interest by the end of the day and are therefore not being
counted,'' Lieberman said. ``My concern is that the numbers as
they've given them to me underestimate the amount of speculation.''
   Thompson was to appear at Lieberman's hearing to present the
Mercantile Exchange's side. Another of Lieberman's witnesses, a
former stockbroker who now works as a financial consultant, planned
to paint a darker view of the oil trading industry.
   Oil futures prices can be manipulated by traders spreading
rumors, and the eventual effects can be devastating to the economy,
the witness, Rande Leonard of Phoenix, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   ``The implications are too great to have some jokers messing
around, just jacking up this commodity,'' he said. ``If they want
to do this to something, let them do it in pork bellies, orange
juice, cocoa.''

   NYCOR Inc., a Basking Ridge, N.J. company
disclosed on Wednesday it has acquired an 8.2 percent stake in the

   NYCOR, which used to manufacture rotary compressors and

April and now is ``principally engaged in a search for businesses

businesses, according to the filing.
   NYCOR said it will review its investment in Zenith and might
consider direct capital investment, seeking representation on the
board or even acquiring control. NYCOR said it also might sell off
all or some of its holding in the Glenview, Ill.-based manufacturer
of televisions, video cassette recorders and other electronic

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Panama opened
negotiations Wednesday on a banking disclosure proposal that
businessmen say would destroy the country's bank secrecy and hurt
its overseas banking business.
   The proposed legal assistance agreement covers investigation,
prosecution and prevention of crimes in general but its main target
is the laundering of drug money in Panama's international banking
center.
   Panama allows banks to disclose information on accounts only
when a crime that is covered by Panamanian law is being prosecuted
in this country.
   The United States is proposing disclosure of all information
about transactions worth more than $10,000 when there is an
investigation into a ``crime or violation of laws of the side
requiring the information,'' according to a draft of the proposal
obtained by The Associated Press.
   Private banking and business organizations immediately stated
their opposition.
   The Banking Association, a private organization of nearly 100
banks, warned in that any such agreement must ``not place the
country or the International Banking Center of Panama in a
disadvantageous situation against countries with service economies
and similar banking centers.''
   The association said an agreement should be applied only when
laws of both countries are violated and not apply to violations of
tax or foreign exchange laws.
   Signing the agreement, ``far from solving our problems, worsens
them,'' the Association of Panamanian Business Executives said.
   ``By pretending to give the Justice Department of the United
States indiscriminate access to any bank account, without regard
for the honorability of the account holder, would destroy the
confidentiality and the possible exodus of a large amount of
depositors would begin,'' the businessmen said.
   ``This would endanger many jobs. This cost would not be offset
by the economic assistance that the United States has conditioned
to the signing of this agreement.''
   Part of the $420 million in U.S. aid approved for Panama after
the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that overthrew dictator Manuel Antonio
Noriega was conditioned on the signing of a legal assistance
agreement.
   Noriega is jailed in Florida, awaiting trial on drug trafficking
charges.

   The meeting of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions will

   Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s profits dropped 78 percent in the third
quarter and National Stee Corp. saw a 9.5 percent dip, the
companies reported Wednesday.
   Bethlehem cited lower prices, fewer shipments and higher
operating costs. National, based in Pittsburgh, said its drop was
partly due to reduced demand for its more profitable products.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Bethlehem Steel</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For the quarter, Bethlehem Steel reported net income of $10.1
million, or 5 cents a share, on sales of $1.21 billion. In the same
period last year, the company had profit of $46.9 million, or 54
cents a share, on sales of $1.27 billion.
   The Bethlehem, Pa.-based company said orders have slowed, but
that the amount of orders in the third quarter was relatively
strong.
   The company said shipments should increase slightly in the
fourth quarter and said price increases take effect in the first
quarter of 1991.
   Bethlehem Steel's net income for the first nine months of 1990
was $53 million, or 46 cents per share, on sales of $3.7 billion.
In the same period last year earnings were $196 million, or $2.35
cents per share, on sales of $4.1 billion.

   For the three months ended Sept. 30, profits totaled $11.4
million, compared with $12.6 million in the corresponding period of
1989.
   Sales increased 4 percent to $633.8 million from $609.1 million.
   Kokichi Hagiwara, National Steel's chairman and chief executive,
said unscheduled equipment outages and sales of a greater
percentage of less profitable products were factors in his
company's ``somewhat disappointing'' third-quarter performance.
   For the first nine months of the year, net income fell 62.9
percent to $20.3 million from $54.8 million in the same period last
year. Sales were about even at $1.9 billion.
   Earnings in the nine-month period included credits of $2.7
million, compared with $15 million in the same period of 1989.
   NKK Corp., the Tokyo-based iron and steel giant, owns 70 percent
of National, which is not traded publicly. National Intergroup owns

<HEAD>Travelers Reports $499 Loss in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. Wednesday reported a
third-quarter net loss of $499 million, citing its move earlier
this month to add $650 million to reserves to cover expected real
estate losses.
   The loss, which amounts to $4.93 a share, came on premiums of
$1.808 billion. That compares with net income of $94 million, or 89
cents a share, on premiums of $1.866 billion for the third quarter
of 1989.
   Travelers forecast a $500 million third-quarter loss on Oct. 5,
when it announced it would add to its reserves for expected losses
in mortgage loans and real estate investments.
   The company said that excluding the impact of the reserve
addition, third quarter net income was up 47 percent from a year
earlier.
   Edward H. Budd, chairman and chief executive, said the sharp
decline in the commercial real estate market prompted the company's
decision to add to reserves.
   Budd said despite the third-quarter loss, Travelers is
performing well in its core businesses, including managed care,
employee benefits and property-casualty.
   Budd said since the beginning of the year, Travelers' managed
care and employee benefits operations have posted a record $1.3
billion in new business.
   For the first nine months of 1990, the company reported a net
loss of $306 million, or $3.08 a share, on premiums of $5.808
billion. In the first nine months of 1989, the company reoprted a
net income of $306.1 million, $2.95 per share, on premiums of
$5.898 billion.

Co. of Riverside, which bought The Herald-News in June 1989.
   The newspaper, published Monday through Friday, has a paid
circulation of about 2,100. It served the central San Bernardino
Valley since 1923.
   ``When we bought it, it was a paper in distress, and we thought
we could resurrect it,'' Hays said. ``The downturn in the economy
has made us decide we have tried enough. We're not willing to
sustain the losses any longer.''
   Hays said the newspaper lost a ``considerable amount of money,''
but declined to provide exact figures. He said some of the
newspaper's 24 employees would be hired by The Press-Enterprise,
but most would be laid off.

   William J. Rush, publisher and
editor-in-chief of The Morning Journal in Lorain, Ohio, was named
chief executive of the New Haven Register Wednesday, the papers'
parent company announced.
   Rush, 53, led The Morning Journal's move from an afternoon to a
morning publication and coordinated a $6.5 million building
expansion and press installation.
   The Morning Journal and the New Haven Register are both owned by
Princeton, N.J.-based Journal Register Co., which is a holding
company of the New York investment firm E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co.
The investment firm acquired publisher Ralph Ingersoll II's
American newspapers in July.
   Rush replaces Thomas P. Geyer, who was dismissed Oct. 15 in a
disagreement with the Register's new owners over the need for more
layoffs.
   The Register laid off 19 employees at the beginning of this
month and 30 more a day after Geyer's departure. Twenty of the
positions were in the news department.
   Rush, who was introduced Wednesday to Register employees, said
his first priority will be to ``make sure the paper fulfills its
commitment to the community while being financially responsible.''
   Rush spent 11 years in editorial and advertising management
positions in New England and Ohio before joining Horvitz Newspapers
in 1969 as assistant to Harry R. Horvitz, the chief executive
officer.
   He subsequently served as chief executive at The News-Herald in
Lake County, Ohio, the News Journal in Mansfield, Ohio, The Record
in Troy, N.Y., and The Tribune Chronicle in Warren, Ohio.
   A native of Alliance, Ohio, Rush is a 1958 graduate of Ohio
State University's School of Journalism.
