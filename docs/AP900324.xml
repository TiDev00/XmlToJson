   An arrow was shot at a Greyhound bus Friday as
it was leaving a Cleveland terminal en route to Pittsburgh, police
said.
   There were no injuries and no arrests, said police Lt. Martin
Flask.
   Flask said the bus carrying 59 passengers was leaving the
terminal at about 2:40 a.m. when the arrow embedded in a window on
the passenger side, four rows from the door. He didn't know whether
it shattered the window.
   The driver didn't report the incident until he had the bus on
the interstate, when he radioed his dispatcher, Flask said.
   About 6,300 drivers and 3,000 other workers at the Dallas-based
company went on strike March 2.
   Greyhound does not plan to resume talks until attacks against
buses driven by replacement workers stops and the union softens its
wage demands, said company spokesman George Gravley.
   He said there have been 20 shootings since the strike started,
with no serious injuries reported.

<HEAD>Buckey Retrial Delayed Due to Defense Lawyer's Back Trouble</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The retrial of Raymond Buckey on eight counts
of child molestation in the McMartin Pre-School case was postponed
Friday because his defense lawyer has back trouble.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg said examination by an
independent physician revealed that medication would alleviate pain
from a herniated disk suffered by attorney Danny Davis and he moved
the trial to April 9.
   The trial was originally scheduled to begin next week.
   ``I have a herniated disk and it is from sitting on this case
for six years,'' Davis said outside the court.
   Asked if he agreed to the delay, Buckey said, ``Yes, your
honor.''
   Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez said, ``The witnesses are
very unhappy about this. They consider this another ploy by Danny
Davis.''
   The prosecutor estimates it will take six months to try Buckey
on the eight counts. ``I just want to go to trial. I want to have
this case over,'' Martinez said.
   Ray Buckey, 31, was acquitted in January of 40 of 53 molestation
counts in the first McMartin trial. His mother and a co-defendant,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted of all counts against her. The
trial lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than $10
million.
   The jury deadlocked on the other 13 counts against Ray Buckey
and the trial judge declared a mistrial on those charges.
Prosecutors refiled the 13 counts, but dropped five to strengthen
their case.
   If convicted on all eight counts, Buckey could be sentenced to
15 years in prison, although time he served while awaiting trial
and good behavior could reduce that to about 7{ years.

<TEXT>
   A column of about 100 military vehicles
rolled through the Lithuanian capital before dawn Saturday in what
apparently was another bid by the Kremlin to unnerve leaders of the
breakaway republic.
   Lithuanian leaders condemned the maneuver and accused the Soviet
Union of waging psychological warfare against the small Baltic
republic, which declared independence on March 11.
   Nervous Lithuanian legislators passed a resolution transferring
power to the senior diplomat of independent Lithuania in Washington
in case of emergency, and several of them walked about 100 yards
from legislative chambers to a highway overpass to watch the column
rumble through the city at 4 a.m.
   ``This is absurd, armored vehicles don't usually drive through
the middle of town in the middle of the night,'' Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimeira Prunskeine told reporters at the legislature.
   ``We're not afraid, but we don't know what they want, and we
don't know what they will do in the next few hours,'' she said.
   The convoy moved along the main highway through the heart of
Vilnius in the early morning darkness without stopping.
   A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament said he had seen the
convoy pull into a military base at Siaures Miestelis on the north
side of the capital.
   Audris Butkavicius, a Lithuanian deputy who said he talked to
some of the soldiers, said they told him there were about 1,000
paratroopers in the column.
   There were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers and
dozens of green military trucks. The parliament's information
deparment quoting witnesses said there were 59 tanks and 50 other
vehicles.
   Deputies, who were still meeting in the Supreme Council
legislature to finish forming their independent government, said
they had not been notified in advance of the convoy's movement.
After deputies checked out the column's movement, they broke up and
began to go home.
   Gorbachev and his advisers have pledged not to use force to halt
Lithuania's formation of an independent government. But Lithuanians
are concerned the Soviet military will forcibly try to detain
soldiers who deserted and returned to their native land after the
declaration of independence. Saturday was the deadline for them to
return to their units.
   A top military adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, indicated Friday the military would
try to round up the deserters, ``even if some people don't like
it.''
   Gorbachev also told the republic's president, Vytautus
Landsbergis on Thursday that Lithuania should stop signing up
volunteer forces, and sought a response from the Lithuanian leader
within two days.
   Landsbergis, in an early morning telegram to Moscow, said the
volunteers would not replace Soviet KGB border guards and uniformed
police, as Gorbachev suggested the Lithuanians would.
   Speaking about Saturday's maneuvers, Landsbergis said: ``Tension
is rising with this demonstration of military force, with this
frightening of people with Soviet soldiers.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday afternoon, ``The situation appears to progressively get
worse.''
   The republic is working to restore the independence lost to
Stalin's army in 1940.
   U.S. officials said the Soviet Union had ordered two American
consular officers out of Lithuania, giving them 12 hours to leave.
U.S. officials said other foreign diplomats and some journalists
also had been told to leave the Lithuanian capital.
   The diplomats, Leningrad-based consuls Douglas Wake and Jon
Purnell, said Friday night in Vilnius that they had heard nothing
about the order for them to leave.
   While Fitzwater said the diplomats ``will comply,'' he said the
United States was ``not given a reason'' by Moscow for the
expulsion. He said the Soviet chief of protocol relayed the
expulsion notice to officials at the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   He said the two officials were in Vilnius ``on routine reporting
and analysis as they do for the embassy.''
   ``They are staff people in our consulate in Leningrad,'' he
said. ``They're not spies.''
   Wake, the U.S. diplomat, said U.S. officials regularly traveled
to Lithuania in the course of their consular work, but declined to
comment further on his mission there.
   Later Friday, Fitzwater said it was ``unclear what specific
actions have been taken against journalists. But we are opposed to
any infringements on freedom of the press.''
   Soviet officials on Friday continued to increase their pressure
on Lithuania to renounce its declaration of independence from the
Soviet Union:
   _The Soviet Union informed Poland it was suspending visa-free
travel for Poles and Lithuanians across the border, the official
Tass news agency said.
   _A military helicopter with a Soviet red star emblazoned on its
side dumped leaflets on downtown Vilnius containing a copy of
Gorbachev's directive that the republic of 3.8 million respect
Soviet law.
   _Foreign Ministry officials said Soviet embassies would review
foreigners' visa applications to travel to Lithuania, to keep out
people ``inclined to engage in illegal activities,'' Tass said. It
did not elaborate.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
a half-century ago as part of an agreement between Josef Stalin and
Adolf Hitler.
   President Bush said Friday that any attempt by the Soviets to
intimidate Lithuania or to use force ``is bound to backfire. That
is inevitable.''
   Lithuania issued an appeal to the world for support late
Thursday.

   A car Reggie Lane repossessed had an
unexpected accessory _ a 19-month-old baby comfortably asleep in
the back seat.
   ``I thought I was going to be charged with kidnapping,'' Lane
said.
   Police received two calls within minutes of each other Thursday,
one from the mother and another from Lane, the surprised and
nervous owner of an auto recovery business.
   The 22-year-old woman reported her car had been stolen and her
baby kidnapped. The woman said she stopped at her aunt's house to
make a telephone call and locked the car doors with the baby
sleeping in the back seat.
   Lane and his partner, who would identify himself only as Steve,
said they broke into the car and drove away. Lane later pulled into
a service station, and when his partner pulled in behind him, he
got out and noticed the baby.
   ``I said: `Oh, God! There's a baby in back,''' Steve said.
``We've found guns and drugs in some of the cars we've picked up,
but never a baby.''

   A federal agency overseeing part of the
savings and loan bailout last year awarded a $49,000 no-bid
contract to an attorney who had pressed regulators not to seize the
California thrift that later suffered a $2 billion failure.
   Margery Waxman was awarded the five-month contract by Mary K.
Bush, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Board, one
of several agencies established under the S&amp;L bailout plan to
regulate the nation's 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks.
   The finance board replaced the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In
1988, Waxman represented the Lincoln Savings and Loan when the bank
board's San Francisco office was urging its Washington headquarters
to seize the thrift.
   In a May 1988 letter to Lincoln's owner, Charles Keating, Waxman
said she had lobbied board officials and told Keating, ``You have
the board right where you want them.''
   Waxman worked with Ms. Bush in the early 1980s at the Treasury
Department. The Waxman contract was one of three Ms. Bush awarded
last year, without competition, to longtime friends.
   The housing board is overseen by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and its chairman is HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. HUD
officials said Friday that Kemp met with Ms. Bush this week and
told her he was cutting her powers and assuming final authority for
all agency contract awards.
   A $37,000 no-bid consulting contracts went to Wendell W. Gunn,
who was Kemp's chief of staff for several months last year. The
third was a $100,000 contract with an Atlanta management consulting
firm whose partners include Kevin Coyne, also a former colleague of
Ms. Bush's at the Treasury Department. Work on all three has been
completed.
   A spokesman for Ms. Bush said she awarded the contracts because
she knew the recipients had the expertise to help the agency. The
contracts were not put out for bid because the housing finance
board receives no tax dollars and so is not subject to competitive
procurement guidelines.
   Kemp's top deputy, HUD Undersecretary Alfred DelliBovi, said
Friday that Kemp was not aware of the contracts until this week.
DelliBovi said Kemp knew Gunn was advising Ms. Bush but did not
know he was being paid and would not have approved of such an
arrangement because of Gunn's past work at HUD.
   DelliBovi said Kemp continues to support Ms. Bush, whose
expected appointment as chairwoman has not been announced by the
White House some seven months after the agency was created.
   The name of Waxman, of the Washington office of the law firm
Sidley &amp; Austin, surfaced in connection with the Lincoln case last
week when House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas,
released her letter to Keating and said it suggested ``a fix was
in'' at the bank board.
   In the letter, Waxman told Keating she successfully lobbied M.
Danny Wall, then the director of the now-defunct board.
   ``As you know, I have put pressure on Wall to work toward
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff,'' Waxman
wrote.
   Ten days later, despite recommendations from its San Francisco
office, the Bank Board declined to take action against the thrift
and took the unusual step of shifting oversight responsibilities
from San Francisco to Washington.
   Wall last week denied being pressured by Waxman and her law firm
denied any impropriety.
   Keating has gained notoriety because of his large contributions
to five senators who intervened with regulators on his behalf.

<HEAD>U.S. Hopes Supercomputer Pact Leads to Japanese Trade Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has its first payoff
after 10 months of pressuring the Japanese to buy more American
products, but members of Congress are warning much more needs to be
done.
   The administration announced Friday an agreement designed to
boost sales of U.S.-manufactured supercomputers in Japan by
removing some restrictions imposed by the Japanese government.
   The agreement, which is expected to be formally signed in April,
should open a $130 million-market for supercomputers purchased by
Japanese universities and other government agencies.
   The breakthrough came late Thursday night following two days of
intensive negotiations. U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
the new pact ``should give us full and effective access'' to the
Japanese government market.
   It marked the first success for the administration since it put
Japan on a ``hit list'' last April of countries accused of erecting
unfair barriers to sales of American goods.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in Los Angeles for talks
Friday with Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said that
with the agreement, ``We're showing that we can make some
progress.''
   Supercomputers were among three product areas singled out for
negotiations. Little progress has been reported so far in talks on
American-made satellites and wood products.
   ``Are (supercomputer concessions) all we want?'' Brady said.
``No. Are we going to get more? Yes. When, I can't say. I hope
soon.''
   The Japanese are facing a June 19 deadline to show a willingness
to open their markets or face possible U.S. retaliation in
increased tariffs on Japanese products sold in America.
   Members of Congress have been pushing the administration to take
a tougher line in the trade negotiations with Tokyo, pointing to
the $49 billion deficit the United States is running with Japan.
That is close to half the total U.S. trade deficit last year.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said the supercomputer agreement was
encouraging but would have to be followed by increased sales.
   ``Japan must recognize that promises without performance are
simply unacceptable,'' Danforth said.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., noted a 1987 agreement by the Japanese
to buy more American supercomputers had not produced results. He
said U.S. negotiators shouldn't declare victory too soon.
   ``Nonetheless, progress is always encouraging. I hope this is a
sign that the United States and Japan can jointly work out their
trade frictions,'' said Baucus, who is chairman of the Senate
Finance trade subcommittee.
   In addition to the product talks, the administration is
conducting separate discussions on broader structural impediments
to trade such as exclusionary Japanese business practices.
   Brady met with Hashimoto as a follow-up to trade discussions
held by President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   A U.S. trade official, briefing reporters in Washington on
Friday, said the Japanese showed new urgency in the latest round of
computer talks, apparently reflecting the impact of the Bush-Kaifu
meeting.
   ``Their negotiators came with instructions to make a deal,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We hope
the Japanese will perceive the same kind of guidance in the other
issues.''
   Negotiators handling the structural impediments talks met at a
remote hideaway in the Virginia countryside earlier this week in
advance of more formal discussions in Washington April 2-3.
However, U.S. officials said the discussions near Warrenton, Va.,
failed to make any progress.
   There have been reports from Tokyo that Kaifu is preparing trade
concessions in these areas in hopes of dampening growing
protectionist sentiment in Congress.
   Under the computer agreement announced Friday, the Japanese
promised to open the procurement process for supercomputers to
foreign firms and to base government purchase decisions on quality
as well as price.

   Commandant Paul Yost defended the Coast
Guard's method of tracking vessels through Prince William Sound,
instead blaming human error for the Exxon Valdez oil spill a year
ago today.
   Nevertheless, the Coast Guard will install a new radar system
better able to track tankers, especially in bad weather, Yost said
Friday.
   ``The system was never designed to track tankers outside the
(Valdez) Arm,'' Yost said. Bligh Reef, where the Exxon Valdez
grounded, is near the end of the arm.
   The new radar system probably will cover Bligh Reef, although
the area never has been considered difficult to navigate, Yost said.
   Yost's comments came the day Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood was sentenced to spend 1,000 hours helping clean beaches
fouled by the spill March 24, 1989, and to pay $50,000 restitution.
   The Coast Guard plans hearings to determine if Hazelwood's
maritime master's license should be revoked, Yost told a news
conference.
   Exxon fired the captain shortly after the accident. His future
also is clouded by more than 100 lawsuits filed by assorted victims
of the spill, the nation's worst.
   The spill poured nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude into
the pristine sound, killing countless birds, fish and other animals.
   Hazelwood was convicted of the misdemeanor charge of negligent
discharge of oil. He was acquitted of two other misdemeanors,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and reckless endangerment, and
a felony, criminal mischief.
   Yost appeared to partially absolve Hazelwood of responsibility,
noting he wasn't on the bridge at the time of the accident.
   ``A fully qualified third mate ran the vessel aground,'' he said.
   It was clear from the trial and from other evidence that human
error caused the grounding, Yost said. No matter what technological
changes are introduced or what laws are enacted, the Coast Guard
cannot guarantee against similar groundings, he said.
   ``We've got to be very careful we don't have a spasm response''
to the spill, he said.

   Former billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, once
considered the world's richest man, says he's worth only about $54
million.
   But the Saudi financier continues to live in a lavish Fifth
Avenue duplex created out of 16 apartments and valued at $26
million.
   Khashoggi _ the middleman in the ill-fated Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostage deal _ showed the place off to Barbara Walters in
an interview on ABC's ``20-20'' that aired Friday.
   The apartment offers fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline,
has a dining room table made of lapis lazuli and a swimming pool
next to a bedroom that has a 10-foot-long bed covered with a sable
bedspread.
   Khashoggi told Walters that he was never worth the billions
people said he had. He said it was more like $1 billion, but a
series of financial setbacks reduced that to $54 million.
   He is about to go on trial in federal court in New York with
Imelda Marcos, widow of deposed Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos.
Khashoggi is accused of helping her the Marcoses conceal a series
of New York real estate deals.

   Julio Martinez, ousted in December as Gov.
Mario Cuomo's commissioner for drug treatment, says he'll be
outside the governor's office Monday _ selling hot dogs.
   He got a city permit Tuesday to become a street vendor outside
the state Capitol and has invested about $10,000, including $3,000
for a cart, in the business.
   ``I've got balloons that say, `He's back _ Knishener Martinez,''
Martinez said. ``It won't be high profile. That's my past. My
future is selling hot dogs, knishes and sodas.'' Knishes, regular
fixtures at New York City hot dog wagons, are pieces of dough
folded over a filling, usually potato or meat.
   Martinez was forced out of his $87,300-a-year job as director of
the Division of Substance Abuse Services after investigative
reports alleged he had directed lucrative state contracts to
friends that produced little or no drug treatment.
   Martinez denied any wrongdoing and there have been no
allegations that he personally profited from the contracts.
   Martinez, 46, a former heroin addict who co-founded the Phoenix
House drug-treatment agency, said his new venture wasn't intended
as a slap at Cuomo.
   ``The governor was good to me. He's one of my heroes,'' Martinez
said. ``I took it on the chin, but life goes on ... I'm doing this
because Julio Martinez has bills to pay.''

   Marla Maples has an offer to appear on
``Hee Haw'' _ if she brings along Donald Trump.
   Ms. Maples, who has been linked with the billionaire by the
tabloids, has been sending out a resume that lists a stint as
``Missy'' on the country music variety show, the Nashville Banner
reported, quoting an unnamed source.
   But the show's producer rebutted the claim.
   ``I don't know where this came from, and to my knowledge she has
never been a guest on the show,'' Sam Lovullo told the Banner on
Thursday.
   Lovullo, however, said he'd be glad to book the actress onto the
show, but only ``if she'd bring Trump along for the cornfield.''
   In New York, Ms. Maples' spokesman, Chuck Jones, said: ``It's
not relevant whether she has or has not been on the show ... If
it's on the resume, it's on the resume, and I just don't have any
comment.''
   Trump's separation from his wife, Ivana, became public last

   Ralph David Abernathy has been hospitalized for a
sodium imbalance that caused him to be lethargic, but the
civil-rights leader was ``not in great danger,'' his physician said.
   Abernathy, 63, was in fair condition Friday at Crawford Long
Hospital of Emory University, said Dr. Robert Kaufmann. Abernathy
was taken there Thursday night.
   Abernathy could be hospitalized a week or so, depending on how
he responds to treatment, Kaufmann said. He was ``somewhat
lethargic, and not as alert as he usually is,'' the doctor said.
   Abernathy was diagnosed with hyponatremia _ an electrolytic
imbalance, or low sodium count _ in his bloodstream. The sodium
deficiency was probably triggered by nausea Abernathy suffered two
days earlier, coupled with diuretics he takes for high blood
pressure, Kaufmann said.
   A sodium imbalance can be life-threatening, but Abernathy is
responding to treatment, Kaufmann said.

   White, 18, a hemophiliac who lives in Cicero, Ind., contracted
aquired immune deficiency syndrome six years ago from a tainted
blood transfusion. He is one of the longest-living AIDS survivors.
   ``I supposedly work with extremely tough people _ mentally and

   In a quiet corner of Chicago's Southwest Side,
world politics have taken center stage.
   Tens of thousands of Lithuanian-Americans live here, and on
Friday many made phone calls, wrote letters and sent telegrams
urging the Bush administration to take a stronger stand in support
of Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union.
   Lithuanian-Americans in other cities also were collecting
donations to send to their relatives and friends and prepared for a
Lithuanian independence rally today near the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington.
   At Nida's Delicatessan and Restaurant in Chicago, the Bush
administration's stand was virtually the only topic of conversation.
   ``Everybody's talking about it,'' said owner Liutas Mockunas.
``Everybody is listening to the news ... People are disappointed by
President Bush's policy, they're really upset.''
   ``Are we going to have to see massacres like (China's) Tiananmen
Square to get the Bush administration to wake up?'' asked Daiva
Meile, spokeswoman for the Lithuanian American Council in Chicago.
``Everyone is extremely upset that Bush has not come out forcefully
for Lithuanian independence.''
   Early today, the Soviet Union apparently stepped up pressure
against the breakaway republic as an armored column of almost 100
military vehicles rolled through the center of Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital. On Friday, the Kremlin ordered foreign
diplomats and some journalists to leave Lithuania as tensions
mounted in the Baltic republic, officials of the Bush
administration said.
   In one of his strongest statements on the issue to date, Bush on
Friday warned the Soviets against military intervention, saying the
United States backs the Lithuanian peoples' ``right to
self-determination.''
   But Lithuanian-Americans said the administration has fallen
short in supporting Lithuania since it declared its independence
from the Soviet Union on March 11.
   ``We are concerned about President Bush's lackadaisical
attitude,'' said Fran Salutas, co-host of Lithuanian-American
Radio, a show broadcast from Chicago each Saturday and monitored
closely by the city's large and tight-knit Lithuanian community.
   ``We need moral and political support from the United States.''
   Chicago Lithuanians worked Friday to fill buses that would drive
overnight to get to the Washington rally, while Lithuanians from
the Boston area who could not make it to Washington planned a
simultaneous demonstration near Bush's summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``We are frustrated,'' said Gintaras Cepas, chairman of the
Boston branch of the Lithuanian American Council. ``All we're
really asking for is moral support _ vocal moral support for what
was a democratic decision by the people of Lithuania.''
   Lithuanians, who flocked to the Boston area in the 19th century
to work in the burgeoning textile mills of Lawrence and Lowell,
have maintained close ties to their heritage, Cepas said.
   ``We don't see a silver lining right now ... and that's kind of
scary,'' he said.
   In Los Angeles, the Lithuanian community mounted a telephone and
letter-writing campaign to fuel U.S. support for the independence
movement.
   Activist Antanas Mazeika said many of California's more than
50,000 Lithuanian-Americans were calling the White House opinion
line and sending letters and telegrams to the president and other
politicians.
   ``We are trying to push (Bush) to be more responsive,'' Mazeika
said. ``We feel at this time it is very urgent for Lithuanians. It
is a dangerous time.''

<HEAD>Census Changed With Nation Through History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first time this nation took its own
measure there were fewer than 4 million Americans, most living on
farms or in small towns.
   It's a far different mix of a quarter-billion people, scattered
from Maine to Hawaii, that are being counted in the upcoming 21st
census.
   Americans began getting their census forms on Friday, the Census
Bureau said, as the first of an estimated 95 million forms began
arriving in mailboxes across the nation. The Postal Service says
all the forms should be delivered by next Tuesday.
   The changes in family and lifestyle, population size, location
and employment have been charted every decade by the census.
Indeed, the U.S. national head count is one of the longest regular
series of such efforts in any country.
   Yet the concept of taking a census is ancient, dating back at
least to biblical times when the Roman census brought Joseph and
Mary to Bethlehem.
   Unlike Mary and Joseph, Americans don't have to go to the
census. It will come to them, mostly through the mail.
   Census takers will travel only to those places where address
lists couldn't be obtained, or where people don't mail back their
forms.
   Delivering the forms and bringing them back will cost the Census
Bureau nearly $44 million in postage, the Postal Service reports.
   President George Washington was in his first term when federal
marshals went out in the summer of 1790 to take the first national
head count. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was in charge.
   Completed in 1792, that census reported there were 3,929,214
Americans.
   This year's census is scheduled for April 1 with a report due to
the president on Dec. 31. Analysis of all the 1990 data will go on
for years.
   Census takers traveled by foot, boat, stagecoach and horseback
in 1790. Those were about the only choices.
   Horses are still used to reach some Indian reservations.
   Census takers in 1790 asked only a few questions and then posted
lists of their findings in public places. People who had been
missed were expected to add themselves to those lists.
   There are long and short forms today which ask dozens of
questions _ too many some contend, though government officials say
they need the data to set policy and operate social programs.
   Information provided is kept confidential now and census takers
can go to jail if they reveal information about any individual.
   That first census found 4.5 persons per square mile and Rhode
Island was the most crowded state at 63.4 per square mile.
   The whole nation in 1987 had 68.8 per square mile and New Jersey
was the most crowded that year with 1,027.3 people per square mile.
   There were five big cities in 1790. Five, that is, that had at
least 8,000 people _ New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Charleston, S.C.
   The population was 80.3 percent white and 19.7 percent black in
1790. By 1988 it was 84.3 percent white, 12.3 percent black and 3.3
percent other races.
   Americans will also have more ways to find out about the results
of the census. There were 103 newspapers and periodicals in the
country in 1790. As of 1987, the nation included 1,645 daily papers
and 11,566 magazines.

   U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra
rebels agree to begin immediate disbanding of their forces in
Honduras, breaking a deadlock in the way of the peaceful transition
of power in their homeland.
   The agreement, reached Friday after talks by the Contras,
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and representatives of
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was praised by
President Daniel Ortega, whose Sandinistas have fought the rebels
for nine years.
   ``This is an accord that recognizes a national consensus and
this national consensus that will put an end to the war and bring
peace to Nicaragua,'' Ortega said in Managua, the Nicaraguan
capital.
   The Contras agreed Friday to begin demobilizing the 12,000
troops in Honduran base camps immediately and said they should all
be back in Nicaragua by April 20, five days before Mrs. Chamorro's
pro-U.S. government is inaugurated. The Contras said another 4,000
fighters in Nicaragua would move into ``security zones.''
   The accord was announced in Tegucigalpa by Obando y Bravo, the
Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua.
   A communique issued at the end of the seven-hour talks said the
U.S.-backed Contras were ready to disband because the Feb. 25
general elections had ``established a process of democratization''
in Nicaragua.
   Ortega, Mrs. Chamorro and President Bush, who has asked Congress
for a $300 million aid package that includes $45 million for
demobilization, have all called upon the rebels to disband.
   The agreement to dismantle the Contras appears to remove the
biggest stumbling block to the transfer of power.
   The outgoing Sandinista government had said they could not
relinquish control of the armed forces as long as the Contras
refused to demobilize. The senior Contra military commander, Israel
Galeano, had said the rebels wouldn't put down their guns as long
as the Sandinistas kept theirs.
   Ortega was at the airport to greet the cardinal and Mrs.
Chamorro's negotiators when they returned to Managua Friday night
from the Honduran capital.
   ``I am going to give instructions immediately to the Foreign
Ministry and the Defense Ministry to take steps to apply the letter
of this accord,'' he told a news conference. ``It is possible that
there won't be a single armed Contra in Nicaragua on April 25th.''
   But Ortega also said he was concerned that Galeano had not
signed the accord.
   ``We hope that this accord will be accepted and respected by all
members of the Contra who are in Nicaraguan territory and that we
can save the Nicaraguan people from a bloodbath,'' he said.
   Antonio Lacayo, one of Mrs. Chamorro's negotiators, said it is
up to the Contras to make sure Galeano respects the accord.
   Ortega said there were between 4,000 and 6,000 Contra rebels
inside Nicaragua preparing for a major military offensive for the
days prior to the inauguration. The demobilization accord should
put an end to any plans for an offensive, he said.
   The head of the Contra negotiating team said 12,000 rebels
living in base camps in Yamales, Honduras, along with 42,000
relatives would be home by April 20.
   ``The Nicaraguan Resistance begins its return to Nicaragua
today,'' rebel negotiator Oscar Sovalbarro, said. ``The process
will culminate on April 20 with the goal of reincorporating its
members into the civilian society.''
   Another 4,000 Contras in Nicaragua would move into security
zones supervised by Obando y Bravo and the United Nations, which
has observer and demobilization missions in the region, he said.
   The agreement calls for an immediate cease-fire to be monitored
by the United Nations and Obando y Bravo, who said the Sandinistas
should ``cease attacks on the rebels'' as a gesture of good faith
toward the pact.
   ``We trust in Obando y Bravo's moral force,'' Sovalbarro said.
   Mrs. Chamorro's team promised pensions for Contra widows and
orphans and to wounded rebel veterans in ``recognition of their
patriotic labors.''
   The Chamorro delegation also agreed to set up a commission
including representatives of the new government and of the Contras
to monitor demobilization.
   The commission and humanitarian aid for the rebels and their
families were conditions the Contras set for demobilization at the
outset of Friday's talks.
   The rebels went into the talks with a long list of demands,
including several _ such as the demobilization of the Sandinista
army _ that would have required the agreement of the Sandinistas.
The Sandinistas were not represented at the talks.
   Ortega agreed to the Feb. 25 elections, which were monitored by
several thousand international observers, as part of a Central
America accord on demobilizing the Contras.
   Within hours of her upset victory, Mrs. Chamorro had called upon
the rebels to disband, saying, the democracy they had been fighting
for had arrived in Nicaragua and there was no longer any reason to
fight.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's savings and loan bailout has
a reprieve from legal disarray, at least until a federal appeals
court can review a lower court ruling that thrift regulators were
appointed unconstitutionally.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth on Wednesday barred the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision from seizing
Olympic Savings and Loan Association of Berwyn, Ill.
   But on Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit lifted the order. It said regulators could take
control of the S&amp;L, but forbade them from liquidating the thrift
and selling its $1.1 billion in assets.
   Lamberth had ruled that acting thrift office Director Salvatore
R. Martoche and his predecessor, M. Danny Wall, had no authority to
order the takeover because they were not nominated by the president
and confirmed by the Senate.
   The appeals court made no decision on the merits of Lamberth's
reading of the Constitution, but it said barring a takeover of
Olympic could hurt the public.
   ``While (Olympic) may have a strong likelihood of success on the
merits (of its case), the harm to the public outweighs the harm to
(Olympic) in this instance,'' the appeals court wrote.
   Government attorneys had argued Lamberth's injunction could cost
taxpayers millions of dollars by encouraging a flood of similar
suits from other weak thrifts.
   In a reply, attorneys for Olympic said allowing regulators to
seize the thrift would make its suit pointless.
   ``Olympic will clearly suffer irreparable injury,'' they wrote.
   The appellate court gave the two sides deadlines for filing
written arguments and scheduled a hearing before a three-judge
panel on April 11.
   Meanwhile, Bush is moving on another front to blunt the effect
of the suit by nominating a former top Labor Department attorney,
T. Timothy Ryan Jr., to a five-year term as director of the thrift
office. The Senate Banking Committee could hold a confirmation
hearing on Ryan as soon as next week.

<HEAD>Bush Offended by Some Art, But Opposes Censorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he opposes government
censorship even though he is offended by ``some of the
sacrilegious, blasphemous depictions that are portrayed by some to
be art.''
   ``I am deeply offended by some of the filth that I see and to
which federal money has gone,'' Bush told a luncheon of regional
news editors at the White House on Friday.
   He made the comment in response to a question about his
administration's opposition to restricting National Endowment for
the Arts funds for controversial art.
   Congressional conservatives have criticized that position, which
was outlined by NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer this week at a
congressional hearing. The critics, contending his administration
is flouting a congressional ban against funding obscene art for
this fiscal year, have proposed tighter constraints on art funding.
   However, Frohnmayer said the White House opposes extending the
restrictions to the next fiscal year. Bush said Friday he wants the
matter handled administratively by Frohnmayer rather than by new
legislative standards.
   ``I am against censorship, but I will try to convince those who
feel differently in terms of legislation that we will do everything
in our power to stop pure blasphemy,'' Bush said.
   Still, he contended he did not want to ``risk censorship or
getting the federal government into telling every artist what he or
she can paint.''
   Bush said he was thinking of two examples of ``blasphemous
material that has no business getting one cent of the taxpayers'
money.'' He said he did not want to say what they were.
   At the question-and-answer session, Bush also:
   _Indicated he would back moving the shipping lanes away from
California shores to help guard against oil tankers fouling
beaches, but said he wouldn't support banning the tankers from the
coast.
   _Renewed his plea to Congress for passage of his embattled $800
million aid package for Panama and Nicaragua.
   _Said it's not ``time to change policy on sanctions'' against
South Africa. ``I want to see more progress'' from South African
President F.W. de Klerk, he said, adding however that he also does
not believe the economic sanctions against Pretoria should be
increased.
   _Said his administration ``would rejoice in being able to help a
democratically elected government in Cuba'' but there is none on
the horizon. President Fidel Castro, he said, ``is swimming against
the tide'' of democracy in the world.
   _Spoke against making the District of Columbia a state. ``This
is a federal city and my view is it should remain that,'' he said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Gangsters and soldiers fatally shot
14 members of civilian defense groups and angry mobs captured and
killed three thugs in a wave of attacks that has followed Haiti's
return to civilian rule.
   The state hospital said it treated at least 20 people for
gunshot and machete wounds, and sporadic gunfire was heard Friday
in most parts of the capital.
   At least 40 people have been killed since Sunday in nightly
shootings widely blamed on gangsters and those still loyal to
ousted leaders Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril and Jean-Claude Duvalier,
according to radio reports Friday.
   Avril resigned March 10 following a week of nationwide
demonstrations against his military government. Three days later a
provisional government led by Ertha Pascal-Trouillot took office
and the army pledged to support her. Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a
Supreme Court justice, is to pave the way for elections in three to
six months.
   The Unity Assembly, a coalition of civic and political leaders
that helped negotiate Avril's departure, attributed the violence to
rightist thugs angered by the shift in power from the military to
civilians.
   ``After this night of intimidation, the army high command owes
the people an explanation,'' said center-leftist politician Dejean
Belizaire, a member of the coalition.
   The coalition urged residents to form the civilian defense
groups, known as ``vigilance brigades'' to compensate for a dearth
of police protection.
   The army had tolerated the civilian patrols. But on Thursday, a
communique read by radio stations said because of the ``widespread
violence'' the high command was urging civilians to disband the
neighborhood groups, to ``not interfere with'' the work of soldiers.
   ``The army alone has the responsibility of maintaining order,''
the communique said.
   Before dawn, soldiers attacked a neighborhood self-defense group
in the St. Joseph slum, killing three members. Shortly after
midnight, soldiers killed two others in separate incidents,
according to Radio Metropole and Radio Haiti Inter.
   Gunmen killed two other civilian defense group members, Radio
Metropole said.
   A wounded youth speaking on the Roman Catholic Church's Radio
Soleil said a truckload of soldiers opened fire on neighborhood
self-defense youths in the La Saline slum, killing seven. He said
soldiers removed the bodies and warned him and several others
wounded in the shooting to keep quiet.
   Radio reports said angry residents killed three thugs,
apparently former members of the Tonton Macoutes, the feared secret
police who served under the brutal, 29-year Duvalier family
dictatorship.
   Most of the Macoutes sought obscurity after Duvalier fled to
exile in France in 1986. But hundreds linked up with the army and
police and are believed responsible for much of the violence
plaguing Haiti, a Caribbean nation of 5.1 million people and the
poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
   The involvement of soldiers in attacks this week appears to
indicate some soldiers remain loyal to Avril, despite their pledge
to the new civilian administration.
   Belizaire said, however, that paramilitary gunmen may be
disguising themselves as soldiers, and said some self-defense
groups ``have been infiltrated by thugs.''
   Many members of the 1,100-man Presidential Guard, supposedly
confined to quarters since Avril was ousted, are believed to remain
hostile to the shift in power to Avril's former enemies. Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot governs with a 19-member State Council, composed
of prominent civilians, some of them persecuted by Avril during his
18-month tenure.
   Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile following a popular uprising
in February 1986. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who was
ousted by Avril in 1988.

   The United States is protesting the ouster of
U.S. diplomats from Lithuania and President Bush is cautioning the
Soviets that force against the secessionists would be ``bound to
backfire.''
   The protests were delivered Friday in Washington and in Moscow
after two American consular officials were given 12 hours to leave
Vilnius, the capital of the breakaway Baltic republic.
   The Soviet foreign ministry gave no explanation in telephoning
the order to the U.S. embassy in Moscow, U.S. officials said.
   The two Americans, Douglas Wake and Jon Purnell, had gone to
Vilnius from Leningrad to assess the standoff between local
authorities demanding national recognition and Soviets determined
to hold the USSR together.
   Other foreign diplomats were ordered to leave, along with a
number of journalists, according to the officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The actions could reduce the information reaching the outside
world about the independence movement in Lithuania and the Soviet
effort to maintain authority there.
   There was no immediate word of U.S. retaliation. And even with
the protests, the administration again sought to minimize tensions.
   ``It's not being treated in a crisis-like way from our
standpoint,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He again
appealed for a peaceful settlement, said U.S. options were limited
and that the administration wanted to ``keep the rhetoric down.''
   Bush declared on Friday that the United States stands with ``the
brave men and women of Lithuania'' in their struggle for
independence.
   And, he said, ``Any attempt to coerce or intimidate or forcibly
intervene against the Lithuanian people is bound to backfire. That
is inevitable.''
   The president did not threaten any U.S. response, however.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, said ``the situation appears to
progressively get worse.''
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, said the situation in Vilnius was
approaching ``anarchy in all its manifestations.''
   Meanwhile, Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin said after a
meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger that he
had no information from Moscow about the expulsions.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said they had
discussed Lithuania and Soviet emigration.
   Earlier, Bush said at a luncheon meeting with visiting media
representatives, ``We know that the Soviet Union has a longstanding
interest in Lithuania, but those interests can only be addressed
through dialogue and negotiation.''
   ``We want to see the people of Lithuania make their independent
determination on what their future is going to be, and not the
Soviet Union,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said from Scottsdale,
Ariz.
   ``Let is hope and let us pray that it is resolved without
violence and that the people of Lithuania can go free,'' he said.

   Astronaut William Fisher says he is confident
NASA will find ways to cut down on the number and length of space
walks the proposed space station will need to keep it running.
   ``This is an engineering problem,'' said Fisher. ``Engineering
is what NASA does better than anything in the world.''
   Fisher and NASA engineer Charles R. Price head a space agency
committee that recently said the station will need impossibly large
amounts of maintenance. They stuck to their estimate after meeting
with NASA executives Friday, but said it's only ``our preliminary,
first cut at this data.''
   Fisher, a physician, and Price said in their study that the
station _ as now conceived _ would require 2,284 hours of
maintenance each year by astronauts working in the harsh
environment of open space.
   After The New York Times published those findings on Monday,
congressional space committees expressed their concerns and three
of them will hold hearings next week.
   ``No, I haven't changed my mind; no, I haven't been pressured,''
Fisher told reporters after Friday's review. But, he said, the
numbers were obtained by asking all NASA space station contractors
to total the amount of time they think it will take astronauts to
fix what breaks.
   ``The number we have come up with in our preliminary first cut
at this data is 2,284 hours in EVA time,'' Fisher said. EVA, for
extra-vehicular activity, is NASA's term for space walks. Fisher
said that's 32 percent higher than estimated in a similar study
last October.
   He said that would require an average of 3.7 space walks a week.
William B. Lenoir, NASA's space flight boss, who conducted Friday's
review told reporters he would prefer no more than one space walk a
month.
   ``I do think there's room for it to go down,'' Fisher said.
``It's our hope we can drive it down significantly. The function of
the next four months is to take piece-by-piece the components of
this number and see how much of its real and to see how much we can
cut down on it.''
   The space station, expected to cost more than $30 billion by the
time it's completed and manned in 1999, is undergoing final design
reviews now with the first construction trips into orbit scheduled
for 1995. Fisher and Price said their study, initiated by NASA, is
part of those reviews.

<HEAD>Duchess' Second Baby Girl 6th In Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarian section and the child, the second
for Sarah Ferguson and her husband Prince Andrew, is sixth in the
line of succession.
   Well-wishers cheered and popped champagne corks outside London's
Portland Hospital following the birth Friday evening. Both the
30-year-old mother and her child were well, the hospital said.
   No name has yet been announced for the baby, but she will be
known as Her Royal Highness, Princess (baby's name) of York.
   The Duchess of York's father, ex-army major Ronald Ferguson,
said at his home at the village of Dummer 50 miles southwest of
London, he had no idea what names the parents would choose.
   The baby is the second girl for the royal couple and is the
sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in
line to the British throne after her sister, Princess Beatrice of
York, who was born Aug. 8, 1988.
   Andrew was present at the delivery, a hospital statement said.
   The Caesarian section was carried out because the baby was in a
breech position, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess had spent the last week at the palace in London
instead of at her country home.
   She arrived at the hospital Friday in a chauffeur-driven car,
which drove her to a side entrance to avoid crowds of press
photographers who staked out the area for the past several days.
   Andrew joined her two hours later after driving the 150 miles
from Devonport naval dockyard where he is a flight commander on the
Royal Navy frigate Campbeltown.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
Buckingham Palace giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York was safely
delivered of a daughter at 7:58 p.m. today. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by Charles' sons, Prince William and Prince
Harry. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and 10th.

<HEAD>Democratic Study Faults Administration's Defense Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic study says Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's proposal to close military bases as a cost-saving measure
is an attempt to divert attention from an inflated defense budget.
   The report released Friday criticized the Bush administration
for its $307 billion fiscal 1991 defense budget that increases
spending over last year, including money for strategic weapons such
as the B-2 stealth bomber.
   ``In the face of dramatic changes in the external threat faced
by the United States, the president has proposed nominal growth in
defense spending for not only the coming year but for the
foreseeable future,'' the Democratic Study Group said in its report.
   The Pentagon has argued that the budget fails to keep pace with
the 2.1 percent increase in inflation.
   The study faults Cheney for requesting new legislation to close
military facilities, thus ending the congressional oversight of
Pentagon decisions on the bases and bypassing the recent process in
which an independent commission recommended which bases to close.
   Complicating matters was Cheney's January announcement of the
candidates for closure or realignment before the department had
completed its review, the study said.
   ``The administration's alternative process involves listing
bases being `considered' for closing long before final decisions
are made _ thereby creating maximum opportunity for full-blown
lobbying campaigns against possible cutbacks,'' the study said.
   Cheney's recommendations called for closing or scaling back more
than 72 domestic facilities and 14 overseas installations. Members
of Congress, including Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, have criticized Cheney's list as
partisan.
   The defense secretary has declined to give exact figures on the
savings from the base closings.
   The study, ``The Great Base Closing Ploy: Creating A Political
Tempest to Shield A Bloated Defense Budget,'' said that 19 of 21
proposed base closings are in Democratic districts.
   ``Of the 41,638 civilian jobs affected by the closings, 41,139
or 99 percent were in Democratic districts,'' the report said.
   The Pentagon, in response to the partisan charge, noted that
Democrats are the majority party in the House.

   Legislators passed a resolution in memory of a
former colleague, only to learn that former House member William
Longworth was still alive.
   At the request of state Rep. Larry Giordano, the House adjourned
Thursday with a resolution honoring Longworth, a legislator from
1949 to 1968.
   Rep. Joseph N. Hermann, who presided over the session, said he
was surprised to hear his friend was dead, since he'd spoken to
Longworth about a week ago.
   When he got home Thursday night, Hermann called Longworth's home
to offer his condolences to Mrs. Longworth.
   ``Would you like to talk to Billy?,'' Mrs. Longworth asked.
``Here he is.''
   Hermann said he told Longworth: ``You're supposed to be dead.''
   Longworth, 75, joked Friday that he had been reincarnated.
   ``I got a kick out of it,'' he said.
   Giordano said he filed the resolution after read an obituary of
a relative of Longworth and thinking it was the former lawmaker.
   ``Larry's intent was tremendous,'' Hermann said. ``Larry's a
big-hearted man. He thought he was doing the right thing.''

<HEAD>Senators Urge Alcohol Testing of Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senators are urging Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner to move quickly to require random alcohol
testing of airline pilots and other transportation workers.
   ``There is no excuse for pilots drinking and flying,'' Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and John Danforth, R-Mo., said in a letter
to Skinner on Friday, citing the March 8 arrest of a Northwest
Airlines cockpit crew.
   Legislation sponsored by the pair that would require random
alcohol tests has been passed by the Senate but remains bottled up
in the House Public Works Committee.
   ``We urge you to exercise the full extent of your authority to
ensure that an incident such as that which occurred March 8th on
Northwest Airlines never happens again,'' the senators wrote.
   The Transportation Department is reviewing comments it solicited
from November through March 9 on alcohol testing before proposing a
specific program, said Hal Paris, a department spokesman.
   DOT issued rules last November for testing transportation
workers for drugs.
   The three-man Northwest crew flew a Boeing 727 with 91
passengers from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis on March 8 while
legally intoxicated, investigators say. All three were all fired by
the airline and charged by federal and state officials with
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.

<HEAD>HHS Proposes New Regulations on Mentally Ill and Retarded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New regulations proposed by the Department of
Health and Human Services would put the burden on states to ensure
that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get appropriate care in
nursing homes.
   The proposal Friday would put into effect a law passed by
Congress in 1987 requiring states to set up programs to screen
nursing home applicants and find more appropriate placements for
mentally ill and mentally retarded applicants who do not need
nursing facility care.
   Another proposed regulation would require nursing homes to meet
new training and competency standards for nurse aides.
   The screening requirement took effect Jan. 1, 1989, although no
regulations were in place. The Health Care Financing Administration
notified state Medicaid directors at the time that compliance was
required, and provided preliminary guidance to the states.
   Failure of a nursing home to meet the terms of the screening
requirement could result in its termination from the Medicaid
program.
   The proposed rule outlines the specific details of the
preadmission screening programs and requires an annual review of
current nursing home residents with mental illness and retardation.

   A federal program to provide community mental
health services to the poor and uninsured has failed because up to
$100 million was squandered building for-profit hospitals with
swimming pools and tennis courts, a consumer group charges.
   Half of 575 community mental health centers funded under the
program are violating federal regulations that require them to be
non-profit, to provide certain essential services and to make some
services available to the poor, Public Citizen Health Research
Group said Friday.
   ``One of the most visible consequences of the failed program has
been a significant increase in the number of seriously mentally ill
homeless and an increase in the number of mentally ill persons in
jails and prisons,'' the group's report said. ``The Community
Mental Health Centers program has been an abysmal failure.''
   A report by the House Government Operations subcommittee on
human resources and intergovernmental relations chaired by Rep. Ted
Weiss, D-N.Y., said its investigation has revealed the same kinds
of violations.
   Weiss called for a General Accounting Office investigation to
determine the extent of the problem.
   And the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human
Services is beginning an investigation in response to a request by
HHS Undersecretary Constance Horner, a spokeswoman for the
inspector general said.
   Alan Leshner, deputy director of the National Institute of
Mental Health, said officials are aware of problems with the
program and 10 months ago began to take steps to correct them.

   Joseph Hazelwood's attorney accused the
judge of ``Hazelwood bashing'' in ordering the Exxon Valdez's
ex-skipper to pay $50,000 and help clean beaches fouled when his
tanker hit a reef a year ago today.
   Hazelwood's lawyers said the 1,000 hours of community service
ordered Friday by Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone are excessive
and the amount in restitution is illegal and arbitrary punishment
for a single misdemeanor conviction for negligence.
   Defense attorney Thomas Russo accused Johnstone of playing to
the media and trying to override the jury's verdict Thursday that
absolved Hazelwood of more serious intoxication and recklessness
charges.
   During sentencing, the judge denounced Hazelwood for drinking
before his ship sailed and for being off the bridge when it went
aground and caused the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``This is another instance of Hazelwood bashing,'' Russo said,
``and in light of the jury verdict this type of demagoguery should
stop.''
   He said 90 percent of Johnstone's comments were directed at
issues that the jury had already decided. He said if blame is to be
leveled, people should begin looking at the Coast Guard, oil
companies and the state itself.
   ``The judge's speech, which in my mind was designed for the
media, was out of step with reality,'' he said. ``To continue this
notion that Captain Hazelwood bears all the responsibility for what
happened in Prince William Sound is ridiculous. It's got to end.''
   As he imposed the sentence, Johnstone said: ``This isn't a
run-of-the-mill misdemeanor.''
   The judge said he wanted to quell public outrage, something
Hazelwood attorney Michael Chalos said he had seen little of.
   ``Whatever outrage I've seen was directed at larger entities,''
Chalos said.
   The judge's sentence also met with the disapproval of the jury
forewoman, Lori Wing, who was in the courtroom with four other
jurors.
   ``I had high hopes he would walk out of here a free man and get
on with his life,'' she said.
   Johnstone, sounding angry, said he had hoped the 43-year-old
skipper would make a public apology. But lawyers said they advised
Hazelwood of Huntington, N.Y., to stay silent because of more than
100 civil lawsuits still facing him.
   Johnstone also imposed the maximum 90 days in jail and $1,000
fine but suspended that sentence. He suggested that imprisoning
Hazelwood would not restore the environment, but having him clean
beaches might help.
   ``I think Captain Hazelwood has been deterred,''' he said in
shunning jail time. ``It's very unlikely he would be given the
opportunity to operate another tanker. He has suffered shame.
   ``But there is community outrage and something has to be done to
provide condemnation and reaffirmation. I'm sure deep down he is
very shameful.''
   Hazelwood's attorneys said they thought the sentence would be
overturned on appeal, in part because the order to pay restitution
to the state was illegal.
   Dick Madson, another lawyer for Hazelwood, said that in almost
any crime a judge can assess an amount that goes to the victim but
it partially must be based on the defendant's financial status.
Defense attorneys said Johnstone chose an arbitrary figure without
measuring Hazelwood's ability to pay.
   A 12-member jury found Hazelwood guilty Thursday of a
misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil. But he was
acquitted of three more serious charges, including a felony, that
he was reckless and drunk during the disaster that blackened the
rocky shoreline of Prince William Sound.
   Hazelwood faced a maximum 7\ years and $61,000 fine on all four
charges.
   The judge acknowledged that pending litigation might delay
Hazelwood's arrival at Prince William Sound. But he said if the
cleanup there is finished by the time appeals are resolved, then
Hazelwood could do other environmental work.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, ran aground on March 24,
1989, and gushed nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine
sound. It killed countless birds, fish and wildlife in the scenic
area.

<HEAD>Study Says Hydrogen Could Explode In Nuke Waste Tanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some nuclear waste storage tanks at the
Hanford nuclear reservation could explode and spew radiation into
the air because of hydrogen gas building up inside them, a new
federal study says.
   Experts don't fully understand the danger, but don't believe an
explosion is imminent, a Department of Energy official said in
announcing the study results Friday.
   Gas buildup in the tanks, which hold waste from the processing
of plutonium for nuclear weapons, was first noticed in 1977.
   ``The worst case is any explosion that could cause the dome to
collapse and send the contents up to the air,'' Hanford manager
Mike Lawrence said. ``I can't sit here and say it's not going to
happen.''
   Department officials think the danger of explosion is low, and
the potential for release of radioactive material even lower,
Lawrence said. That's because the tanks are made of 1{-foot-thick
steel-reinforced concrete and are buried as much as 8 feet deep.
   Hydrogen is accumulating in 20 of Hanford's 169 storage tanks,
Lawrence said.
   The gas is formed by the breakdown of organic material added to
the tanks in the 1970sin an effort to recover radioactive
strontium, Lawrence said.
   ``We've taken every precaution we can think of, but I can't give
you an absolute guarantee,'' Lawrence said. ``This is something
where we don't fully understand what is going on.''
   No storage tank at Hanford has ever exploded, but a blast that
spread radioactivity over a wide area in the Soviet Union in 1957
is believed to have been in a waste storage tank.
   A 1989 report by the Soviet news agency Tass said 10,000 people
were evacuated after a 1957 explosion. The CIA has said deaths were
in the hundreds, and analysts note that 30 central Soviet villages
disappeared from maps after the disaster.
   The 560-acre Hanford reservation in southeast Washington dates
back to the Manhattan Project of the 1940s that produced the first
atomic bomb. While plutonium processing continues there, much of
the work involves cleaning up waste produced over the last five
decades.
   The danger came to light in a study by Westinghouse Hanford Co.,
the main Energy Department contractor at Hanford. The study was
prompted by concerns raised in Congress late last year about the
possibility of ferrocyanide exploding in the tanks.
   Although the ferrocyanide threat was ultimately found to be low,
scientists discovered the hydrogen was a greater danger than had
been previously thought, Lawrence said.
   Scientists hope to produce a plan for dealing with the problem
by June.
   Meanwhile, precautions are being taken with the one tank in
which the problem is worst: All transfers of waste in or out of the
tank have been stopped, and care is taken to avoid generating heat
or sparks nearby.
   That tank is one of Hanford's 20 newer double-walled storage
tanks, and holds 1 million gallons of radioactive waste. The waste
level has risen and fallen by as much as 33 inches because of
hydrogen gas buildup, Lawrence said.
   Hydrogen concentration in the tank has been measured at up to 5
percent at an exhaust vent, and may have been higher down near the
source. A 5 percent hydrogen buildup is considered potentially
flammable, and an 18 percent buildup is considered potentially
explosive, Lawrence said.
   The waste rise was first noticed in 1977, and scientists since
1984 have tried various methods to reduce the gas, including
injecting water into the waste slurry and lancing the surface crust
with pipes to relieve pressure. Those measures failed, Lawrence
said.
   Lesser hydrogen buildup also has been spotted in four other
double-shell tanks, and in 15 of the reservation's 149 older
single-walled storage tanks, Lawrence said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three political parties sought to delay
May's presidential election following the assassination of a
leftist candidate. Soldiers patrolled the capital following rioting
sparked by the killing.
   In a statement sent to local media, the godfather of Colombia's
drug traffickers, Pablo Escobar, denied government accusations he
ordered Thursday's slaying of Bernmardo Jaramillo of the Patriotic
Union Party.
   The government dismissed the denial.
   Shortly after Jaramillo's slaying, Colombians took to the
streets of Bogota, shattering windows and burning buses to protest
what they said was government involvement.
   Jaramillo was the 1,044th Patriotic Union member to be killed in
the past six years and many slayings have been atttributed to
right-wing death squads. The Patriotic Union has claimed Colombia's
army and police are involved in the death squads to quell a leftist
insurgency.
   Jaramillo was the second presidential candidate slain in recent
months.
   The capital was quiet Friday but armored cars with 20mm cannons
and jeeps mounted with machine guns cruised the city of 6 million
people. The government banned alcohol sales and closed all private
schools in Bogota.
   The president of the Patriotic Union, Diego Montana, said in a
televised interview Friday his party was withdrawing from the
presidential elections.
   The Patriotic Union, Conservative and Communist parties all
asked the governing Liberal Party of President Virgilio Barco to
postpone the May 27 elections, saying they feared for the safety of
their candidates.
   Shortly after Jaramillo's slaying, a telephone caller who
claimed the assassination for the Medellin cocaine cartel said drug
traffickers were renewing their war with the government. The caller
also said Cesar Gaviria, the Liberal Party candidate, would be the
next victim.
   On Jan. 18, traffickers declared a unilateral cease-fire in a
5-month-old war with the government. They appealed for the
government to stop extraditing suspects to the United States.
   The government war began following the assassination of Sen.
Luis Carlos Galan on Aug. 18. Hours after Galan's death, Barco
began efforts to extradite drug barons to the United States. In
Colombia, traffickers often intimidate or bribe judges to ensure
light or no sentences.
   The protests in Bogota began when Jaramillo was slain at
Bogota's international airport Thursday. A 16-year-old youth, who
reportedly received $750 for the killing, was wounded and captured,
but three other attackers apparently escaped.
   Unrest continued into the pre-dawn hours Friday in poorer
neighborhoods of the capital. Bursts of submachine gun fire from
snipers in one neighborhood killed a soldier, the army said. Four
policemen and a civilian were wounded.
   Later Friday, police cleared streets of roadblocks made from the
burned vehicles and burning tires.
   In central Barrancabermeja, the site of Colombia's main oil
refinery, workers of the state oil company Ecopetrol reacted to the
assassination by staging a 48-hour walkout. Another 48-hour strike
was declared in the northwestern region of Uraba, where Jaramillo
began his political career.
   On Friday, Escobar sent a letter to Colombian news media denying
his complicity. He suggested other drug traffickers were to blame,
according to the Colombian radio networks RCN and Caracol.
   But on Friday, the National Security Council reiterated that
Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, ordered Jaramillo's
assassination. A communique from the council said security forces
monitored a telephone call in which Escobar ordered the
assassination.
   The unidentified youth captured after Jaramillo's slaying said
he was hired in Medellin to kill the candidate, but investigators
said he would not say who hired him.

<HEAD>Maryland Voters Won't Get Abortion Law; Guam Measure Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A complicated legislative compromise to put abortion before
Maryland voters apparently has been derailed, and a federal judge
on Guam temporarily blocked the U.S. island territory's new
abortion law, the nation's strictest.
   Either the Guam law or a less stringent measure awaiting the
governor's signature in Idaho could be the vehicle to challenge the
U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized abortion.
   The Maryland measure, which emerged from the state Senate after
an eight-day filibuster by anti-abortion forces, was rejected
Friday by a House of Delegates committee.
   The unusual arrangement would have required the legislature to
pass two measures: one permitting unrestricted access to abortions
during the early stages of pregnancy, the other restricting
abortion to cases of rape, incest or dire threat to the mother. In
essence, the voters, through referendum, would have decided between
the two measures.
   Legislators who advocate abortion rights generally opposed the
compromise, while anti-abortion lawmakers favored putting the issue
before the electorate.
   ``We think the process would be far too confusing for voters,''
said Delegate Patricia R. Sher, a Democrat who supports a woman's
right to choose abortion. Abortion-rights forces, she added, feared
the amount ``of money that the churches would bring in here would
be awesome.''
   Democratic Sen. Francis X. Kelly, a leading abortion foe and one
of 16 senators who mounted the filibuster, noted that the group's
original goal _ to block the abortion-rights bill _ was met.
   ``I can't say I'm unhappy,'' Kelly said, ``But from the
experience, I believe the voters should decide. It's a shame the
voters won't be able to.''
   The House Environmental Matters Committee voted 13-12 against
the package Friday night.
   The measure could be revived on the House floor, but that was
considered unlikely because of House Democratic leadership
opposition.
   In Agana, Guam, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson issued a
temporary restraining order Friday blocking enforcement of the
territory's new law, a few hours after residents and medical groups
filed a class-action lawsuit. He scheduled a hearing for Monday on
whether to extend his order.
   Guam's law, which Gov. Joseph Ada signed this week, prohibits
abortions except when a pregnancy endangers the life of the mother.
It makes it a felony to perform abortion or aid in the procedure,
and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or have an abortion, or
for a person to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   It provides for a referendum Nov. 6 for voters to decide whether
to retain the law.
   The lawsuit alleges the measure violates constitutional
guarantees of privacy, due process, free speech, equal protection
and religious freedom.
   Also Friday, Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus was the target of a brief
sit-in by high-school students demanding he veto an abortion bill
approved by the legislature Thursday.
   The measure, the strictest yet approved by a state legislature,
would ban abortion except in cases of non-statutory rape reported
within seven days, incest if the victim is younger than 18, severe
fetal deformity or threat to the mother's life or health.
   Andrus, an opponent of abortion, hasn't said if he intends to
sign the bill.
   Abortion-rights groups in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Rhode
Island and North Carolina have threatened to boycott Idaho potatoes
if Andrus fails to veto the bill.

<TEXT>
   Li Zhen, a Long March veteran and Communist
China's first woman general, has died, an official newspaper said
today. She was 83.
   The China Daily said Li died March 11 but gave no cause of
death. President Yang Shangkun and ranking military officers paid
last respects to her at a ceremony Thursday, the newspaper said.
   Li was promoted to major general in 1955 and until 1988 was the
only woman general in the People's Liberation Army, the China Daily
said. The 3.5 million- member army is now believed to have four
women generals.
   Official biographies say she was born in Liuyang, Hunan province
and given away by her parents at age 6.
   In 1926, she fled from her husband and joined the Communist
Party, and the next year participated in the Autumn Uprising in
Hunan, Mao Tse-tung's first attempt to lead peasants in a rebellion
against local authorities.
   She took part in the 1934-35 Long March, the Red Army's epic
escape from the ruling Nationalists to northern China, and held
various political positions in the army. The Communists defeated
the Nationalists and took power in China in 1949.
   She served as director of the Political Department of the
Chinese military force in Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War.

   Cleanup crews are gearing up for a
second season of trying to erase the signs of the nation's worst
oil spill, but there's little agreement on just what needs to be
done.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, who toured Prince William Sound, spoke
Friday of deformed herring eggs and streams bereft of young salmon.
   But Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost, in his own news
conference Friday, disputed the governor's gloomy assessment of the
damage wrought by spill from the grounded Exxon Valdez a year ago
today.
   Yost said he learned from his own visit to four heavily oiled
shores this week that cleanup still is needed. But he said Exxon's
1989 efforts and the effects of winter storms and waves made a
``major, major difference.''
   ``There is a tremendous improvement in the situation,'' Yost
said.
   For its part, Exxon Corp. is proposing a cleanup _ smaller than
last year's $2 billion effort _ that the state considers inadequate.
   Cowper told reporters: ``There is a lot of cleanup work left to
do this summer.''
   ``The indications are that there is biological damage. We hope
it isn't long-term,'' said Cowper, who on Thursday visited shores
blackened when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude.
   Cowper released preliminary data from the state Department of
Environmental Conservation that suggests damage to salmon and
herring fisheries in some streams that enter the sound.
   At one heavily polluted site, a normally rich salmon stream on
Latouche Island, ``not a single small salmon exists this spring,''
Cowper said. Though results of the state data are not definitive,
he said, ``it indicates that the oil in the substrata killed
whatever was there.''
   The governor also said 90 percent of the herring roe at another
site have shown aberrations.
   Dramatic measures may be required in this summer's cleanup
program to save the fisheries and other resources, Cowper said.
   Yost said he doubts the existence of state biological data
mentioned by Cowper. If the state is holding ``secret'' data it
should be released immediately, he said.
   Cleanup is scheduled to begin May 1, after the Coast Guard
determines on a ``mile-by-mile basis'' what kind of treatment will
be required this year, Yost said. The Coast Guard has final say on
details of cleaning an estimated 120 miles of shore affected by the
spill.
   Exxon contends it should use less intrusive measures than it did
in last year's effort, which depended on such drastic techniques as
blasting oil-fouled rocks with hot water or steam. Oil-eating
bacteria are a possible weapon, company officials have said.
   Cowper said he would urge more intrusive techniques _ including
such unproven tactics as bulldozing shorelines _ if they get rid of
the oil and allow micro-organisms and other life to re-colonize the
fouled areas.

<HEAD>Brazil's President Softens Harsh Economic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello
softened harsh anti-inflation measures that have almost paralyzed
the economy, lifting restrictions on bank withdrawals for some
poorer Brazilians and charities.
   Collor announced the adjustments just one day after saying his
measures, which threatened to plunge the nation of 150 million into
recession, were ``not negotiable.''
   In his announcement Friday, he maintained the basic structure of
the 8-day-old plan, which includes an 18-month freeze on savings
account withdrawals of more than $1,200 and a limit on money market
withdrawals to $600. The emergency measures froze $115 billion in
savings.
   The president appealed to Brazilians to save and warned spending
could lead to higher annual inflation, now at 2,700 percent.
   ``We have begun slowly to open the tap and irrigate the
economy,'' Collor said in a nationally televised meeting with
congressmen and Cabinet ministers.
   The adjustments announced Friday allow special bank withdrawals
in certain cases, such as for retired people, recently laid-off
workers, truckers, charities, union funds and farmers with
employees to pay. It was not immediately clear whether any amount
for additional withdrawals was specified.
   The freeze, which was maintained for the rest of the country,
has caused a brutal shortage of cruzeiros, the local currency.
Sales at stores and restaurants have plummeted, and businesses have
begun laying off employees.
   Collor urged Brazilians to ``just buy what is strictly
necessary'' and avoid a spending boom, which would cause prices to
rise.
   ``Prices are falling because there aren't enough cruzeiros in
the marketplace,'' he said. ``Don't spend money on superfluous
items _ bargain, bargain, bargain, and make your money go farther.''
   The Mar. 16 plan froze prices for a month and guaranteed a wage
increase in March of 73 percent, equal to February inflation. The
cost of living in March is expected to reach 85 percent.
   The president also appealed to businessmen not to fire workers
and implied banks could face retaliation if they don't cooperate
more ``vigorously'' with the plan.
   Collor predicted that ``in 30 or 45 days inflation will be
totally under control.''
   According to some union estimates, more than 30,000 workers were
fired in the past week. Hardest hit were construction workers,
including some 19,000 let go in the southern state of Parana alone.
   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city and financial center,
federal police arrested four executives of the Eldorado supermarket
for raising prices despite the freeze.
   A poll conducted in Brazil's 10 largest cities published Friday
in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper showed 81 percent of the
population supported the measures. Only 5 percent opposed them.
   The 26 economic reform measures became law immediately but can
be repealed by Congress within 30 days. The reforms also included
drastic spending cuts to eliminate a budget deficit, higher taxes
for the rich and a new currency.
   Collor said he would limit payments on the $115 billion foreign
debt this year to just $5 billion, about half last year's total.

<HEAD>Residents Battle Police in Protest of Gas Leak, 42 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500 protesters battled police,
demanding the closure of a wastewater treatment plant that leaked
chlorine gas, police and witnesses said today. Forty-two people
were reported injured.
   A gas leak from the plant in southern Taiwan Thursday sent 540
area residents to the hospital. Chlorine can be lethal in high
concentrations but otherwise causes burning eyes and sore throats.
   Before the clash, irate protesters punched the plant manager and
forced him to inhale from the leaky gas tank, the mass-circulation
China Times reported. He required medical treatment, the report
said.
   During a 30-minute battle Friday night, protesters hurled rocks
and bricks at police, who fought back with clubs, witnesses said on
condition of anonymity. Angry protesters also smashed a police van,
they said.
   In all, 42 people were injured in the clash, police said.
   Witnesses said the clash was touched off when 800 policemen in
full riot gear tried to prevent the protesters from entering the
Kaohsiung wastewater treatment plant, 215 miles south of Taipei.
   After the battle, several protesters sneaked into the plant and
turned off equipment, triggering another clash with police who
tried to stop them, witnesses said.
   The residents' demand to shut down the plant was rejected by
Kaohsiung Mayor Su Nan-cheng, who said without it the city's
industrial wastewater would have to be discharged into rivers.
   Protest leader Chen Han-sheng and a policeman were hospitalized
in serious condition with head injuries. Twenty policemen were
among those treated for minor injuries and released from hospitals,
police said.
   The mayor told 300 residents gathered outside the plant today
that authorities had taken measures to stop the gas leak. The crowd
dispersed after he agreed to discuss other demands, including calls
for lower taxes, and health insurance and other compensation.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Much of $150 Million Xerox Lawsuit Against Apple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge rejected most of a Xerox Corp.
lawsuit contending that Apple Computer Inc. pirated the screen
display responsible for much of the popularity of its revolutionary
Macintosh personal computer.
   Xerox said it would appeal Friday's ruling by U.S. District
Judge Vaughn Walker.
   The $150 million lawsuit, filed in December, alleged that Apple
derived the software for its Lisa and Macintosh computers from
Xerox computer programs.
   The lawsuit alleged that Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple, had
seen a demonstration of a Xerox program called Smalltalk at Xerox's
Palo Alto Research Center in 1979, and that he and other Apple
employees copied the concept. Jobs left Apple in 1985.
   Smalltalk was the first computer language to use a mouse, a
small, hand-held device used to manipulate information on a
computer screen.
   Since then, most personal computer makers have adopted the mouse
and so-called windows programs that let the average person operate
a personal computer without learning complicated, typed-in
commands. Instead, they use the mouse to move a pointer around the
screen and execute commands.
   Vaugh dismissed five of six counts in the Xerox lawsuit. The
dismissed counts involved allegations of unfair competition and
attempts to have Apple copyrights invalidated.
   The only remaining count sought a declaratory judgment stating
that Xerox owns the copyright to its Star program, one of those it
accuses Apple of pirating.
   In a news release from its Stamford, Conn., headquarters, Xerox
said: ``This ruling does not mean Apple has not taken substantial
portions of Star and claimed them as their own. The court merely
held, we believe erroneously, that Xerox did not have standing to
present facts in support of that contention. ... We intend to
appeal.''
   From Apple's Cupertino headquarters, spokeswoman Carleen
LeVasseur responded: ``We welcome the ruling in every way. I'm
confident that the sole remaining issue will be dismissed in the
near future.''
   Referring to the remaining accusation, LeVasseur said, ``Apple
has never disputed the validity of Xerox's registration.''
   Apple responded at the time of the lawsuit that Xerox's concepts
weren't protected by copyright any more than birds or trees were
protected by the copyright on a painting.
   The lawsuit said Xerox had never licensed Apple to use the Star
computer program or its graphics. It also accused Apple of gaining
unauthorized access by hiring several Xerox employees in the late
1970s and early 1980s, including Star software developers.
   The lawsuit claimed Apple employees saw the Star program at the
trade show in Houston in June 1981 and copied substantial portions
into its Lisa and Macintosh Finder.

   A car packed with explosives blew up as it
passed the Economy Ministry, killing the driver and wounding six
passers-by, including a policeman, a mother and her 6-month-old
baby, police said.
   Police said no group took responsibility for the bombing Friday,
but the leftist Shining Path rebels have stepped up attacks in
recent days. Police blame them for the assassinations of four
congressional candidates in five days, including one in Lima on
Friday.
   The violence is aimed at undermining the government by
sabotaging elections April 8.
   The unidentified motorist was driving along a busy avenue in
downtown Lima late Friday and apparently intended to park the car
before the ministry. But before he could stop, the vehicle exploded
and struck another car.
   Six people nearby were wounded, including the driver of the
second car, a policeman guarding the entrance to the ministry, and
a woman and her 6-month-old baby.
   The political assassinations have prompted the government to
declare a state of emergency in Lima and place national police on
alert as additional security for the election. The government also
announced Friday it was reimposing a state of emergency in nearby
Callao.
   The Maoist Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected
governments since 1980. It launched its armed insurgency in the
southern highlands, and now operates throughout the Andean region
and in the jungles of the northeast.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
violence.

   Estonia's divided Communist Party is meeting with
independence for their republic topping the agenda, but party
leader Vaino Vyalyas is making it clear he intends a more cautious
approach than Lithuania.
   In a report Friday to the party congress, he emphasized the need
for party reform and support for Estonian independence according to
his secretary, Nina Slavina, and Radio Moscow, but Vyalyas talked
of negotiations with Moscow.
   Another major topic at the congress is a possibile party split
with Moscow.
   The party heard a draft program which declared that the party
supports ``the independence of the Estonian state on the basis of
the free expression of the people's will, with due account for
processes taking place in the Soviet Union and Europe,'' the Soviet
news agency Tass reported.
   However, the program described the path to independence as ``an
arduous and controversial process that requires ... legal
foundation and the establishment of a solid economic and social
basis.''
   It said Estonian independence should ``proceed through
negotiations between Estonia and the Soviet Union,'' Tass reported.
   Vyalyas chided the neighboring Baltic republic of Lithuania for
its March 11 declaration of independence from Moscow.
   He said, in remarks monitored in London, that the Estonian
Communist Party ``does not approve of all the political steps taken
by the new Lithuanian parliament.''
   Baltic states Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were forcibly
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 following the signing of
a pact between dictators Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Josef
Stalin of the Soviet Union in 1939.
   Moscow has not recognized Lithuania's independence declaration.
   Final results of Estonia's election on Sunday, made public
Friday, indicated that the independence-minded People's Front won
46 of 105 seats in new legislature, Tass said. The front also
enjoys support by some small parties.
   About 55 lawmakers also are members of the Communist Party,
which embraces 106,000 of Estonia's 1.6 million people.
   The Communists are split, however, among People's Front
supporters, backers of the Free Estonia movement, and followers of
Russian-speaking groups.
   Tass said election results would make it hard for Estonians who
want independence to get the two-thirds majority needed to push
through a parliament decision on independence.
   Russian-speaking members strongly oppose such a move and can
join with Free Estonia to block it, the agency said.
   Estonian activists, however, say they expect Free Estonia to
support the independence drive with some reservations.
   Before the party congress, the Communist Party was split between
those who wanted to cut off from Moscow, as Lithuania's Communists
did in December, and those supporting the Moscow party platform.
   Ms. Slavina said a compromise proposal was submitted to the
Congress.
   Tass said the draft program should unite all ``honest
Communists'' wanting to contribute to the development of democratic
Socialism in Estonia. It also said Estonia's Communist Party
``abandons the practice of administrative socialism and utopian
models of the future.''
   No details of the compromise proposal were immediately available.
   Radio Moscow said the congress was also to consider a draft
resolution on the party's history, attributing its faults to its
never having been independent.
   The resolution condemns ``the false policy and activity of the
party'' that have had serious consequences for the Estonian people
and the Estonian independence, and says the party, together with
Moscow and party authorities there, ``bears responsibility for acts
of force against the Estonian people.''

   A grand jury declined to indict a man who
fatally injured a homeless man in a subway platform brawl two
months ago.
   ``I never meant to hurt that unfortunate man who attacked me,''
Rodney Sumter, 39, said at a news conference Friday after the grand
jury's decision was released. ``I pray to God that he rests in
peace.''
   Sumter had said he was acting in self-defense to protect his
3-year-old son when the incident occurred Jan. 21.
   Witnesses said the homeless man verbally abused, spat on and
punched Sumter.
   ``He has been vindicated,'' said Mel Sachs, Sumter's attorney.
   Sumter and his son Ptah, now 4, had been awaiting the train home
after seeing a movie. Sumter initially was charged with
first-degree manslaughter in the death despite a public outcry that
the killing was justified.
   ``It is our policy to submit every homicide case to the grand
jury for investigation,'' said Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau. ``This case underscores the vital function the grand
jury plays in the criminal justice system.''
   The homeless man, a regular denizen of the subway station, was
never identified. He was buried Feb. 14 in an unmarked grave in
Queens.
   The grand jury's decision was not condemned by advocates of the
homeless.
   ``We're delighted that the grand jury has absolved Mr. Sumter,
who is as much a victim as the homeless man who died,'' said Keith
Summa of the Coalition for the Homeless.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Complete Withdrawal From Sri Lanka</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRINCOMALEE, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last Indian peacekeeping
soldiers withdrew from Sri Lanka today after 30 months of a
stalemated jungle war against Tamil guerrillas.
   A Sri Lankan naval band played ``Auld Lang Syne,'' and Sri
Lankan soldiers unsheathed swords in a guard of honor for the
departing Indians, who came to enforce an agreement supposed to end
the guerrilla war.
   About 2,000 soldiers _ the last to be withdrawn from a force
that once numbered 125,000 _ sailed from from the eastern city of
Trincomalee for Madras, in southern India.
   ``You have made a great sacrifice, there is no doubt about
that,'' Sri Lanka's defense minister, Ranjan Wijeratne, told the
camouflage-uniformed troops.
   At least 1,155 soldiers died fighting guerrillas of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest militant group
demanding an independent Tamil nation.
   The Indian troops arrived in northern and eastern Sri Lanka in
July 1987 under an India-Sri Lanka accord to disarm the Tamil
Tigers and several other Tamil separatist militant groups.
   While most groups surrendered their arms, the Tamil Tigers
reneged on the accord in October 1987 and turned their guns on the
Indian soldiers who had once trained them. The Tigers claimed the
provisions of the accord, which promised limited autonomy, did not
meet their aspirations.
   As the jungle war continued, India sent more reinforcements. At
one point about 125,000 soldiers patrolled the northeast.
   Last summer the new government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa
reached an agreement with the Tigers and asked India to pull out
its troops by July 29, 1989, the second anniversary of the peace
accord.
   At that time, Indian forces controlled most of the larger towns
in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, but the Tamil Tigers ran an
effective underground movement from the dense jungles and swamps.
   New Delhi stalled on the withdrawal request for about six
months, leading to diplomatic standoff between officials of the two
countries.
   In January, after the new Indian government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh took office, India and Sri Lanka agreed on a March 31
deadline.
   The long stay brought severe criticism in both Sri Lanka and
India. Many Indian newspapers said the troops were needlessly
fighting ``somebody else's dirty war.''
   ``We've been ordered to leave and that's what we are doing,''
said a commando at the Trincomalee dock, pushing back his red beret
to wipe sweat from his forehead. ``We don't think we have lost a
war. We're just obeying orders.''
   Across the bay from where Magar sailed, Tamil Tigers patrolled
Trincomalee's streets accompanied by Sri Lankan soldiers and
police, the forces which desperately tried to put down the Tamil
rebellion between 1983 until the Indians' arrival in 1987.
   In recent months, the Tamil Tigers have joined other groups in
negotiations with the Sri Lankan government.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
wanted to set up a separate homeland in the northern and eastern
districts where most of the country's Tamils live. The Tamils
claimed they were discriminated in jobs, education and the use of
Sinhala language by the majroity Sinhalese.
   The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military. Tamils are
mostly Hindus.
   Besides the Indian troop casualties, 10,000 Sri Lankans have
died in the Tamil insurgency. In addition, the 1987 peace accord
and the presence of Indian soldiers, sparked a backlash by
chauvinist Sinhalese guerrillas that cost 6,000 lives since 1987.

   Human rights groups and lawyers called on the
government today not to extradite a Chinese hijacking suspect to
what they say could be his death in China.
   Zhang Zhenhai, who is being held for the Dec. 16 hijack of a
Chinese airliner with 233 people aboard to Japan, is facing
extradition despite his claim that he was fleeing persecution
because of his political activism.
   The Air China Boeing 747, on a flight from Beijing to New York,
flew to Fukuoka in western Japan after it was commandeered and was
refused landing permission by South Korea.
   ``We will do everything we can in order to keep Mr. Zhang from
being sent back to China,'' said Shoichi Kawaguchi, a member of the
Foundation for Asian Human Rights.
   He said lawyers, university professors and groups supporting
Asian workers and students are seeking ways to stop the government
from repatriating Zhang.
   Zhang's trial on charges of air piracy opened Friday at the
Tokyo High Court.
   The court must decide by April 22 whether to agree to a Chinese
request that the 35-year-old man be sent back to China. Japanese
authorities handed over Zhang's wife and young son to China within
hours after the Chinese jetliner landed at Fukuoka, prompting
public criticism that officials had not done enough to investigate
whether they were leaving China for political reasons.
   In Friday's court session Zhang repeated statements he has made
to investigators that he fled China to seek political asylum after
he taking part in the pro-democracy movement in Beijing last spring.
   However, prosecutors told the court Zhang hijacked the aircraft
to escape criminal charges in China and find work in Japan, the
reports said.
   Court and Justice Ministry officials were not available for
comment today because of the weekend holiday.
   The prosecutors said testimony from Zhang's wife and
acquaintances provided by China said the defendant had never
participated in anti-government activities.
   A coalition of groups including the National Christian Council
of Japan and the Catholic Council for Justice and Peace have
demanded the Justice Ministry and Tokyo High Court not repatriate
Zhang and called for him to be tried in Japan.
   ``We are not saying the hijacker should be forgiven,'' the
groups said in a statement. ``But Japan seems to be trying to
repatriate Zhang without a full investigation into the case. Such
an attitude raises questions from the standpoint of the
constitution, international law and humanitarianism.''
   Kazuyo Iwaki, one of three lawyers defending Zhang, has said
Japanese officials should not assume that he will not be executed
if he is extradited.
   The Chinese government has told Japan it will not execute Zhang.

   Leaflets calling for an end to Chinese rule have
appeared in China's westernmost region, raising concern of ethnic
violence, an official from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region said
today.
   The sparsely populated desert region in China's northwest is
home to 25 different minority groups _ including several large
Moslem groups _ who account for 62 percent of Xinjiang's population.
   Amudun Niyazi, chairman of the Xinjiang People's Congress
standing committee, told The Associated Press that there has been
no violence in the region so far.
   But he said authorities recently have discovered handbills,
leaflets and other materials ``instigating separatist activities''
circulating through the region, one of China's largest ethnic
minority areas.
   Niyazi said most of the material has come from former Xinjiang
residents now living overseas, but declined to provide other
details.
   In the past few months, news reports from Xinjiang have hinted
of ethnic trouble. Editorials and commentaries stressing the need
for unity and stability and denouncing ``separatist'' activities
have increased markedly.
   China violently imposed its rule on the region in the 1950s,
slaughtering those who took part in anti-Chinese revolts.
   Since then, the ethnic groups have largely accepted Beijing's
domination, although tensions remain and ethnic trouble has
surfaced from time to time.
   The largest ethnic groups include the Moslem Uygur and Kazakh
minorities, central Asian groups with close ties to people living
across the border in the Soviet Union.
   In January, the region's armed police were ordered to intensify
riot training and intelligence work as a prevention against unrest.
   Xinjiang's delegates to the National People's Congress, holding
its annual session in Beijing this week, were earlier quoted by the
Xinjiang Daily as saying, ``Currently, Xinjiang still has a small
number of separatists, who present the greatest threat to
Xinjiang's stability. ... We must be on the alert.''
   The delegates called them ``the scum of the Chinese people'' and
said they were carrying out their activities under the guise of
advocating religious freedom and democracy.
   Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Song Hanliang, who toured
southern Xinjiang in February, told party members, ``Every place
and (work) unit now has some `hot spot' problems,'' and urged them
to ``handle the problem while it is still in the embryonic stage.''
   In the early 1980s, there were sketchy reports of a series of
anti-Chinese rebellions.
   In May, Moslems protesting a Chinese book that they said
desecrated their religion stormed party headquarters in Urumqi.
Official reports said 43 trucks were overturned and smashed and 150
policemen injured. One person was sentenced to life imprisonment
for ``pillage'' and at least nine others received jail terms.

<HEAD>CDC Pulls Registration Of 3 Monkey Importers Over Virus Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control halted
imports by three of the nation's largest monkey dealers effective
today amid concerns over the spread of deadly Ebola virus in
monkeys in at least two research centers. CDC Director William L.
Roper said CDC inspectors had found ``inadequate'' isolation and
quarantine conditions at the three suppliers this week.
   The concerns arose after Ebola virus _ known in pre-AIDS days as
the deadliest virus in the world _ was spotted in the United States
in November in three monkeys at the Hazleton supplier in Virginia.
In January, an Ebola-related virus turned up in a monkey in a
Pennsylvania laboratory.
   ``Humans can be infected but it's not very common,'' said Dr.
Susan Fisher-Hoch of the CDC.
   Medical researchers and drug manufacturers on Friday urged Roper
not to ban imported lab monkeys, saying that could set back efforts
to find cures for AIDS and other serious diseases.
   Roper said in notices Thursday to Worldwide Primates of Miami,
Charles River Primates Corp. of Port Washington, N.Y., and Hazleton
Research Products Inc. of Reston, Va., that effective today, ``your
registration to import non-human primates into the United States
will be revoked.''
   The three are among four importers who handle 90 percent of U.S.
monkey imports, CDC officials said. The fourth supplier was
inspected and found to be in compliance with CDC guidelines, and no
action has been taken there.
   Dr. W.E. Tucker Jr. of the pharmaceutical giant Burroughs
Wellcome Co. argued against a ban during a special CDC meeting.
   ``If a ban is put into effect it will seriously affect our
efforts to develop agents to treat very serious diseases,'' he said.
   Monkeys often are used for AIDS research, and banning them could
cut AIDS research by 50 percent, said Dr. Frederick King, director
of the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta.
   ``I'm for not throwing out the baby with the bath,'' King said.
   ``We must take all precautions ... but we must not needlessly
sacrifice the research which depends on these primates,'' said Dr.
Vance Gordon of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.

<HEAD>Three Killed In Christian Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled with
howitzers and mortars north of Beirut early today, stirring fears
of a new round of all-out fighting in the Christian enclave.
   Police said three people were killed and seven wounded in the
fighting in Kesrouan province between Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and
the Lebanese Forces militia led by Samir Geagea.
   The latest fighting raised the casualty toll since Aoun moved
against Geagea Jan. 30 to at least 765 killed and 2,123 wounded,
most of them civilians.
   Both sides accused each other of provoking the latest clashes,
the most serious violation of a March 3 cease-fire in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   The two armies had fought each other to a standstill before the
cease-fire arranged by a three-man committee of neutral Christian
mediators.
   Fears that a new flare-up was looming have been raised by the
mediators' failure to work out a political settlement to end
struggle for domination of the estimated 1 million Christians in
the enclave.
   Tens of thousands have fled in recent weeks because of the
fighting _ the bloodiest confrontation between Christian forces
since the Christian-Moslem civil war erupted in April 1975.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said a large-scale battle ``appears to be in the
offing, especially if the mediation committee is unable to work out
a settlement.''
   That would mark another serious setback for an Arab
League-brokered peace accord aimed at ending the nearly 15-year-old
civil war.
   Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi, elected Nov. 24 to
implement the peace plan, has not been able to extend his authority
in the Christian enclave because Aoun refuses to recognize him and
rejects the accord.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily quoted unidentified
government sources as saying the United States has informed
``officials that Aoun must step down in favor of the legitimate
authority'' of Hrawi.
   The report did not elaborate. But the United States, like all
countries with which Lebanon maintains diplomatic relations,
recognizes Hrawi as head of state.
   Aoun, 54, considers himself the sole legitimate authority in
Lebanon.
   In September 1988, Aoun, the army commander, was named head of a
caretaker military government by outgoing President Amin Gemayel
before his six-year term expired with Parliament unable to elect a
new head of state.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun and Geagea, sacked Aoun as
army chief and interim prime minister in November. But Aoun has
refused to quit either post.
   He considers Hrawi's election unconstitutional on the grounds
that Parliament, elected in 1972 before the civil war began, is no
longer representative of the nation.
   Aoun rejects the peace accord endorsed by Parliament in the
Saudi Arabian resort of Taif in October because it does not
guarantee the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The Syrians entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Geagea recognizes the presidency and has made cautious signals
welcoming the Taif accord.

<HEAD>Report: Bias Throughout State Justice System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bias against women in the California
justice system is often blatant, sometimes subtle, and apparent in
the sharp contrast between the opinions of female and male judges,
a state report found.
   The report released Friday said gender bias in the state would
decline if the proportion of women judges increased above the
current 13 percent _ a figure already nearly twice the national
average.
   ``The gender bias that we have found in the judicial system
reflects the society,'' said Los Angeles County Superior Court
Judge David Rothman, co-chair of a state Judicial Council committee
that produced the study.
   ``As judges we have an obligation to do something about it,'' he
said.
   A theme common to many of the findings was ``the lack of
credibility with which women are regarded in the courts,'' said Los
Angeles County Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin, vice-chair of
the study.
   She said bias shows up in many ways: judges who call a male
expert witness ``doctor'' but ask a woman with the same credentials
whether she prefers ``Miss'' or ``Ms.'' Another tendency by many
male judges is to doubt women's stories that their husbands beat
them or molested their children.
   The report offered 65 recommendations, including simplifying and
speeding up procedures for restraining orders against domestic
violence, improving health care for female prisoners, and putting
anti-bias provisions into the judges' code of conduct, the law
school curriculum and the bar exam.
   The study was begun in 1986 by Chief Justice Rose Bird and
continued by successor Malcolm Lucas after Bird's defeat in the
1986 election.
   The study cited a survey last year of 473 California judges that
showed some sharp differences in attitudes between men and women on
the bench.
   Forty percent of the male judges, but only 22 percent of the
women, thought domestic violence cases should be dealt with by
counseling instead of prosecution; 47 percent men but 75 percent
women disagreed with a statement that domestic violence allegations
were often exaggerated; 7 percent men but 45 percent women said
they had heard other judges make remarks demeaning to women.
   Many of those comments were chronicled, most of them
anonymously: a male judge who told a female lawyer not to try ``any
of your feminine tricks ... any of your emotionalism,'' another who
asked two women lawyers if they'd had a ``cat fight,'' others who
invariably asked the woman in a group of lawyers if she could type
up a settlement agreement.
   The study said demeaning comments were more likely to come from
lawyers than judges. Committee members, speaking to reporters, also
said individual remarks by judges, however shocking, were not as
pervasive a problem as others covered by the report, such as the
difficulties encountered by women in divorce courts, domestic
violence cases and prisons.
   ``Most of the gender bias is institutionalized,'' Watson said.
   For example, she said, members visiting the main women's jail in
Los Angeles County found pregnant women who had not seen a doctor
for four months. They also said mothers awaiting trial for a year
were not told where their children had been placed and were given
only one change of underwear a week.
   Chirlin said another important finding was the low status, and
relatively meager budgets, of family law courts.
   ``Any issues relating to families and kids are, quote, women's
issues, and are seen as less important,'' she said. The report
urges an increase in family court judges and a study of the
adequacy of child support levels.

<HEAD>27 Injured in Emergency Escape From Airplane Leaking Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-seven people were injured today during the
emergency evacuation of a Cathay Pacific Airways jet that began
leaking fuel after landing at Tokyo's Narita airport, officials
said.
   During the evacuation, the strong winds rocked the inflatable
escape chutes, knocking the passengers to the ground, officials
said. Of the 27 injured, three suffered broken leg or pelvic bones.
   All but one were released later today after treatment in a
hospital, hospital officials said.
   Passengers said they heard a loud noise and felt a shock when
Flight 508 from Hong Kong, with 300 people aboard, touched down in
strong winds.
   The TriStar jet, made by Lockheed Corp., began leaking large
amounts of fuel. It was halted as it taxied toward the gate and the
decision was made to evacuate the passengers, police said.
   Airport officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
plane's left wing was damaged. The cause of the accident was being
investigated, the officials said.
   Due to the strong winds, seven flights to Narita were diverted
to Haneda, Tokyo's domestic airport, the officials said.

<TEXT>
   A storm that moved across the Midwest today dumped more snow in
Kansas and Missouri and threatened a winter redux in the Northeast.
   Snowfall accumulation early today had reached as much as 8
inches in northern Missouri and 7 inches in parts of central Kansas.
   Light snow also fell today south of Indianapolis, in
southwestern Pennsyvania and in Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky.
   The storm front threatening southern Ohio was expected to bring
up to 5 inches of snow overnight to West Virginia and between 2 and
4 inches to Philadelphia.
   Snow also was expected today in New York, New England and
portions of South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa.
   Elsewhere, unseasonably warm temperatures were expected to
extend across the Southwest, and thunderstorms were to scatter over
the southern Plains.
   Forecasters predicted highs today in the 80s and 90s in the
Southwest and Florida, and in the 40s and 50s across much of the
nation's midsection.
   Thunderstorms produced inch-thick hail near the Oklahoma towns
of Mountain Park and Meers on Friday.
   In the Florida Panhandle, some of an estimated 2,500 evacuees
began moving back to their flood-damaged homes on Friday as swollen
rivers began receding. The flooding stemmed from torrential rains
in Alabama and Georgia a week ago. The nation's high Friday was 97
degrees at Borrego Springs, Calif.

   A CIA employee says there was no attempt to
cover up a missile shipment to Iran, only ``a great deal of
confusion'' over the 1985 delivery of Hawk missiles central to the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Norman Gardner testified on Friday that John Poindexter and
William Casey, the late CIA director, did not orchestrate a false
cover story about the U.S. government's role in the November 1985
shipment of 18 Hawk missiles.
   Poindexter, who was President Reagan's national security adviser
at the time, is accused of conspiracy, obstructing Congress and
making false statements by saying he didn't find out until January
1986 that Hawks had been delivered to Iran.
   Casey told Congress on Nov. 21, 1986, the same day as
Poindexter's alleged lies, that the CIA had been asked by Israel to
arrange to fly ``bulky cargo'' to Iran. The plane's crew, said
Casey, was told it was oil drilling equipment.
   Casey and Poindexter had attended a meeting the previous day to
go over Casey's upcoming congressional testimony.
   Gardner later reported to the White House on how Casey's
appearance went on Capitol Hill.
   ``Did you tell Admiral Poindexter that the cover story wasn't
holding up very well?'' Iran-Contra prosecutor Christian Mixter
asked Gardner.
   ``No, I didn't,'' said Gardner, denying there was a false cover
story.
   Gardner said that after much review in November 1986, it was
determined that the CIA found out Hawk missiles were aboard the
plane when the flight to Iran already was under way.
   ``The CIA shipped'' the missiles yet ``didn't know'' they were
missiles? U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene asked.
   The missiles were being shipped from Israel, explained Gardner.
   ``But this was the CIA's airline,'' said Greene.
   ``That's right,'' replied Gardner.
   Hours after Poindexter briefed congressmen and Casey testified
on Nov. 21, 1986, the national security adviser tore up a
presidential document ratifying the Hawks delivery.
   The politically embarrassing document, called a finding,
depicted the shipment as part of an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Neither Poindexter nor Casey had told Congress of the finding's
existence. The CIA director sent it directly to Poindexter in
November 1985 with instructions to keep it secret from anyone
``below our level,'' although by November 1986 Gardner knew of its
existence, too.
   According to Gardner's notes of the meeting, Poindexter told
House Intelligence Committee members that Reagan did not approve
the shipment.
   Why didn't Gardner speak up and disclose the finding? asked
Mixter.
   Because ``it was not done before the shipment,'' responded the
CIA employee, explaining that it had been drafted a day or two
after the missiles were delivered.
   Gardner, at the time special assistant to the agency's
then-deputy director of operations, Clair George, is now the CIA's
deputy director in the office of congressional affairs.

   Greyhound says it won't move to reopen talks
with picketing drivers until the union tries to end strike-related
violence.
   The union says the comments by Anthony P. Lannie, Greyhound vice
president and the company's chief negotiator, are ``nothing more
than a subterfuge to avoid going to the bargaining table.''
   Lannie met for two hours Friday with Bernard E. DeLury, the
director of National Mediation and Conciliation Service, but no new
talks with the union were scheduled.
   ``We will not bargain with a gun pointed at us,'' Lannie said
after the meeting.
   The mediation service said both sides were ``maintaining an
ongoing dialogue'' with the agency and that there was a ``prospect
of resuming negotiations in the near future.''
   The company broke off talks last Sunday, accusing union leaders
of failing to negotiate and of stepping up violence.
   ``We do not condone violence _ our position on that is clear,''
said Nick Nichols, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions.
   Lannie said wages, job security and grievance procedures _ key
issues in the strike _ did not come up in Friday's meeting as
company officials and federal mediators focused on ways to end
strike violence.
   Since the strike began March 2, 21 buses driven by replacement
workers have been shot at and several more have been pelted with
bricks and rocks, the company said. There were no serious injuries.
   The latest incident occurred Friday night in Tucson, Ariz., when
a bus en route to El Paso was struck by one bullet as it crossed
the picket line, said Greyhound spokeswoman Melanie Scofield. The
bullet struck the windshield, she said. None of the 21 people
aboard were injured. Scofield said the driver decided to maintain
his schedule and did not report the shooting until he arrived in El
Paso.
   Earlier Friday, a bus carrying 59 passengers was the target of a
bow and arrow attack in Cleveland. No one was hurt.
   Also Friday, a striking driver was hit by a bus in Atlanta and
was taken to a hospital for observation, Nichols said. More than 60
pickets have been struck by buses, hit by security guards or
injured in other incidents over the three weeks, Nichols said.
   On the second day of thestrike, a veteran Greyhound driver was
crushed to death on the picket line by a bus driven by a
replacement in Redding, Calif. No charges were filed.
   Lannie said the union could join the company in offering rewards
for information leading to the arrest of people responsible for the
violence and urge union members to turn in anyone who commits an
illegal act.
   ``The union has not cooperated with the authorities. They've not
taken any affirmative action to bring this violence to a halt. To
take a hands-off, we-don't-know-anything approach is absurd,''
Lannie said.
   Nichols said the union has told members it would support
prosecution for those responsible for violence or property damage.
   ``As to putting bounties on people's heads, we believe that
local law enforcement agencies are best trained and best equipped
to investigate these matters,'' Nichols said.
   Nichols said negotiators representing the 6,300 drivers and an
estimated 3,000 other Greyhound workers had hoped federal mediators
could prod the company to resume talks.
   ``We can be there on an hour's notice,'' Nichols said.
   Both sides accused the other of skewing the figures on proposed
wage increases.
   Greyhound said it's offering $63 million over three years, while
the union wants $180 million. The union says it's asking for $40
million and charges that the company's proposal is not ``hard
money'' because it is contingent on profit increases.
   Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service.
The strike has affected many smaller communities for which buses
are the only public transportation.

   The co-leader of a team that crossed
Antartica by ski and dogsled told several hundred cheering fans
welcoming him home that he was thrilled to return to ``your warm
hearts.''
   Co-leader Will Steger and the other five members of the
International Trans-Antarctica Expedition arrived Friday night at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   The expedition had left the airport for Antarctica on July 26.
It completed its 3,741-mile trek at Mirnyy on the Indian Ocean on
March 3.
   The team also included co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France,
Geoff Somers of Great Britain, Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Union,
Keizo Funatsu of Japan and Qin Dahe of China.
   On Friday night, a group of girls sang for the team and people
in the crowd carried posters with ``Congratulations'' and ``Welcome
Back'' written in French, English, Japanese, Russian and Chinese.
   Steger, of Ely, Minn., hugged his parents and then greeted 35 to
40 relatives before clasping hands with well-wishers.
   ``I can't tell you how thrilled we are to come back to Minnesota
and your warm hearts,'' Steger said.
   ``The only thing that really kept us going was the love and
prayers of the people back home. We are so thankful just to be
alive.''
   Steger said that he didn't learn about such events as the fall
of the Berlin Wall for several weeks or, in most cases, until he
arrived in Australia this month and read a magazine reviewing 1989.
   The team traveled to the Australian cities of Sidney and Perth,
then to Paris and London before flying to Minneapolis. After
festivities today on the lawn of the state Capitol, the team is
scheduled to leave Sunday for Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>An Wang, Founder Of Major Computer Firm, Dies After Long Cancer
Battle.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Wang, the slight, Chinese-born engineer whose
development of a major computer firm was a classic American success
story, died today at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long
fight against cancer at age 70.
   Hospital spokesman Martin Bander said Wang died at 5:31 a.m.
   ``He was operated on originally on July 14 of last year for
esophageal cancer, a very difficult form of cancer,'' Bander said.
``He was admitted to the Mass General cancer center on March 6
after suffering some setback.''
   He began Wang Laboratories in 1951 above an electrical fixtures
store in Boston with a work force of one: himself.
   Wang went on to develop the magnetic core, a small
doughnut-shaped ring of iron that was the basic element of computer
memory until the microchip was introduced in the late 1960s.
   A native of Shanghai, Wang was a schoolteacher's son who had
come to the United States in 1945 and went to Harvard as a graduate
student.
   When his firm began to grow quickly, Wang moved it northwest of
Boston to Lowell. The growth of Wang Laboratories took off in 1964
after he introduced a desktop calculator and began development of
office computers.
   Once rated the fifth-richest man in America, Wang spread jobs to
other areas and the company now has about 23,000 employees
worldwide.
   His wife, Lorraine; sons, Fred and Courtney; and daughter,
Juliette, had been at his hospital bedside regularly during his
hospitalization, according to company spokesman Paul Guzzi.
   Wang turned the company's presidency over to his son, Fred, at a
time when the computer industry was entering a time of difficulty.
Fred Wang later stepped down but An Wang continued as chief
executive officer.
   The company last year reported bank debt totaling $575 million,
according to Guzzi, but a retrenchment and sale of assets cut that
to less than $100 million.
   Wang's success gave him a chance for philanthropy and support
for education and the arts, including development of the new Wang
Center for the Performing Arts in Boston.

<HEAD>Talk Show Host Calls Chung Controversial Name</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio talk show host in a small station
outside the nation's capital has twice referred to CBS television
anchor Connie Chung as ``Connie Chink,'' says a published report.
   ``I referred to her as Connie Chink because I thought she was
making fun of President Reagan,'' Cliff Kincaid, who had been
criticizing media coverage of John Poindexter's trial, told The
Washington Post on Friday.
   ``I was making fun of her liberalism and I joked about her name.
I'm sorry if people were offended about it. But my point was to
draw attention to the offensive way she had referred to President
Reagan's videotaped testimony in the Poindexter trial,'' Kincaid
said.
   ``It's a play on words on her last name. It's a slang term. It's
not a vulgar term.''
   Kincaid said his comment contained ``perfectly acceptable
language'' and that he did not consider the word ``chink'' racist
because it ``is like the term honky.''
   Kincaid's on-air remarks came while discussing Chung's
appearance Thursday on the ``CBS Evening News.''
   He said: ``The Dan Rather bias wasn't there, no, I guess he was
on vacation. Connie Chink, uh ... Chung, uh, Chung was sitting in
for him. I'm sick of people in the media like Connie Chink getting
on his back!''
   Kincaid made the comments during his conservative talk show on
the low-powered radio station in Silver Spring, Md., just outside
the nation's capital.
   The station is owned by former presidential hopeful and
televangelist Pat Robertson and his Broadcast Equities, Inc., which
two weeks ago started simulcasting its continuous conservative
programming to Robertson's stations in Charlotte, N.C., and
Oklahoma City.
   Melinda Yee, executive director of the Organization of Chinese
Americans, said, ``We will call for a public apology to the
Chinese-American community.''
   Program director Michael Del Giorno said Kincaid would not be
fired.
   ``It was a slang, not a vulgarity,'' Del Giorno said.

<HEAD>Guatemala Criticized Over Human Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's human rights ombudsman says
the government has been ineffective in breaking up death squads
killing people at the rate of about one a day this year and
abducting dozens of others.
   ``In Guatemala the agents of human rights violations persist.
Government- level efforts to preserve (human rights) are useless,''
Ramiro de Leon Carpio said Friday in a report to the Guatemalan
Congress.
   ``There are extremist sectors involved in the violation of these
rights, which have caused the disappearance of many people and the
murder of others,'' de Leon Carpio said.
   ``Clandestine jails have not ceased to operate,'' he added.
``Demands are presented daily for their disappearance, but no
positive results are being obtained,'' he said.
   He said at least 20 people have been assassinated in the last 15
days in the San Marcos area on Mexico's southern border. At least
54 were killed in January and February throughout Guatemala, he
said. In the first two months of 1990 at least 52 people
disappeared and 23 threats were reported, he said.
   The president of the Congressional Human Rights Commission,
Oliverio Garcia, chastized the administration of President Vinicio
Cerezo ``for its negligence in the investigation of these events
and the capture of the responsible parties.''
   Earlier this month, the United States recalled its ambassador
from Guatemala for a week to protest the government's failure to
stop politically motivated killings.
   ``Guatemala's democracy continues to be challenged by acts of
terrorism and human rights abuses perpetrated by extremists who
seek to undermine the democratically elected civilian government,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said at the time.
   Guatemala returned to civilian government in 1986 after three
decades of military rule in which an estimated 100,000 people died
and 40,000 disappeared. Cerezo blames the violence on a rightist
campaign to destabilize his government. Last year he faced two coup
attempts by army officers.
   The United States provides Guatemala with about $90 million in
annual aid.

<HEAD>Report on Soviet Internment Camp Where Thousands of Germans Died</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have discovered mass graves
containing thousands of victims of a former Soviet internment camp
from the Stalin era, an East German newspaper reported today.
   Among those killed at the camp were Nazi prisoners of war such
as SS members, police officers, Nazi party officials and former
soldiers in Adolf Hitler's army, the Berliner Zeitung said.
   But the newspaper said victims also included ``many innocent
people'' and teen-agers. The youngest victim was 12 years old, it
quoted a surviving inmate as saying. The report did not say how
many thousands of bodies were found.
   The camp was run by the Soviet Union's dreaded NKVD state
security force, a forerunner of the KGB, according to the report. A
local historian discovered the remains earlier this month at
Fuenfeichen near Neubrandenburg, 80 miles north of Berlin, the East
Berlin newspaper said.
   Berliner Zeitung quoted West German estimates that 65,000 men,
women and children died in Red Army imprisonment at the end of
World War II. It likened the ``Stalinist terror'' to Nazi death
camps.
   The report, accompanied by a graphic photograph of an uncovered
skeleton, would have been impossible before the peaceful revolt
that toppled hard-line East German Communist leader Erich Honecker
in October and set the country on course for democracy.
   East Germany, formed out of Soviet-occupied Germany after the
fall of Hitler's Third Reich, was a particularly staunch Soviet
ally for decades but now is dealing publicly with its past.
   This includes reports on brutality in the postwar period when
the Soviet bloc was in the iron grip of Kremlin chief Josef Stalin.
   Berliner Zeitung noted that many German Communists and
socialists were also killed in Soviet camps.
   Forest wardens and farmers knew about Fuenfeichen but kept
silent until now, the newspaper said.
   The camp operated from April 1945 until October 1948. Many
inmates were taken to the Soviet Union when the Red Army closed it
and were never heard from again, the report said.
   It said one prisoner who died there had just been released from
a Nazi camp and was arrested by the Soviets because he resisted the
expropriation of his home.

<HEAD>Syrian, Egyptian Leaders Meet For First Time Since 12-Year Rift
Ended</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Mubarak-Assad meeting</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Hafez Assad of
Syria today met for the first time since ending a 12-year rift
between their countries, joining other Arab leaders in Libya, a
news report said.
   The leaders were attending ceremonies marking the 20th
anniversary of the expulsion of British forces from Libya, the
Libyan news agency JANA said in a report monitored in Rome.
   The news agency said Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi welcomed
Assad, Mubarak and Sudanese leader Omar Hassan el-Bashir, who were
among the leaders at the ceremony in Tobruk on the Mediterranean
coast in eastern Libya.
   Assad's foreign visits are rarely announced in advance, and his
trip to Tobruk surprised officials in his own government.
   JANA said Mubarak and Assad met at the Libyan air base where the
ceremony was being held. It was their first meeting since the two
countries resumed diplomatic ties in December after mediation by
Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
   The report did not say what they discussed.
   Assad broke ties after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made a
dramatic visit to Jerusalem in 1977, the opening move in two years
of negotiations that resulted in the Egypt-Israel peace accord
signed by Sadat. Most other Arab countries broke ties with Egypt
when it signed the treaty with Israel in 1979, and the feud had
been a major obstacle to Arab cooperation.
   But links have been restored since a 1987 Arab summit decided to
allow Egypt back into the Arab fold. Libya, long allied with Syria
in a radical front, has also been patching up its differences with
Egypt.
   In Cairo, Egyptian officials said today that Mubarak planned
talks with Gadhafi on international and Arab issues and recently
improved relations between the two countries.
   The 1970 British pullout from Tobruk's el-Adem air base took
place the year after Gadhafi overthrew the monarchy in a military
coup and established a republic. U.S. forces withdrew from Libya in
June 1970.
   Libya was under British and French administration from 1942,
when the Germans and Italians were driven out in World War II,
until independence in 1951. But the British retained the air base
until the year after Gadhafi toppled the Libyan monarchy in 1969.
   Gadhafi renamed the base after Egypt's late president, Gamal
Abdel Nasser.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge: Vietnamese Launching Counteroffensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NATE THAYER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAKRI, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Khmer Rouge commanders claim that elite
Vietnamese troops have been secretly sent back into Cambodia to
block a guerrilla advance on the country's second largest city.
   The guerrilla officers, interviewed Friday in a jungle base,
said Vietnamese troops disguised in Cambodian uniforms have mounted
a series of counterattacks in a wide area of territory seized
earlier by the Khmer Rouge.
   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese maintained about 100,000 troops in
Cambodia for several years until Hanoi claimed it withdrew its
forces in September 1989.
   Cambodia has denied repeated claims that Vietnamese forces have
returned, and the Vietnamese army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said
Friday that the allegations were ``groundless reports cooked up by
the Khmer Rouge and spread by foreign mass media.''
   The Communist Khmer Rouge, one of three guerrilla groups
fighting the government in Cambodia, has seized hundreds of square
miles of territory in the northwestern province of Battambang and
threatened the capital, Phnom Penh.
   ``The Vietnamese reinforcements are a major obstacle to us
capturing Battambang,'' the Khmer Rouge division commander, Gen.
Yat Thim, said. ``In February the Vietnamese sent many
reinforcements to Battambang, and have mounted operations against
us on many occasions this month.''
   The rare interview with a Khmer Rouge commander took place at a
jungle base near the Thai frontier recently captured from
government forces. The explosions of mines being cleared and
detonated by the guerrillas could be heard at short intervals.
   Western analysts at the Thai-Cambodian border confirmed that
Vietnamese troops were fighting in northwestern Cambodia, but the
reports did not specify the number of troops involved.
   ``There is no doubt the Vietnamese are back,'' said one Western
analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They are now
attacking the Khmer Rouge in several areas of Battambang.''
   The Khmer Rouge's military objectives are unclear, but Yat Thim
confirmed the guerrillas intend to seize Battambang, Cambodia's
second largest city and center of the country's most fertile
rice-growing region.
   The Khmer Rouge produced three captured Vietnamese soldiers on
Friday who they said were seized in the recent fighting. The three
were clearly Vietnamese, but their accounts could not be
independently verified.
   ``We were sent back to Cambodia because the government couldn't
beat the resistance alone,'' said a manacled lieutenant, Ly Guan
Thien, through an interpreter. ``We were told to put on Cambodian
uniforms so we wouldn't be recognized.''
   He said he was captured early this month when his unit of 150
Vietnamese was attacked by the Khmer Rouge in Battambang province.
   Pvt. Long Ngoc Tho said he arrived in Cambodia in early February
with 500 other Vietnamese troops and was captured 12 days later in
fighting around the gem-mining town of Pailin.
   ``There are now many of us in Cambodia,'' he said. ``We were
told that we needed to help Cambodia fight the enemy.''
   The Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist groups fighting the
government made major gains after the Vietnamese pullout. But since
last month, a counteroffensive has forced the guerrillas to give up
some ground.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ending a nearly
4-year-long Khmer Rouge reign of terror. During their rule,
hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people were executed
or died from famine and civil unrest.

<HEAD>Rioters Loot Stores, Burn Cars Amid Wave of Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of unemployed people broke shop
windows, looted stores and set cars aflame in Port Gentil in the
latest protest of austerity measures in this West African nation, a
newspaper said today.
   Many people were wounded and many shops and schools shut down
before the unrest in Port Gentil ended Friday afternoon, several
hours after it began, the Union reported, without supplying
specific figures.
   Security forces were dispatched from Libreville, to reinforce
those in Port Gentil, 100 miles south of the capital, daily said.
   The rioting came two days after workers at the government's
Gabon Refining Company and U.S.-based Mobil Oil Corp. in Port
Gentil joined the wave of strikes that has gripped Libreville for
three months.
   The Union reported that employees at the government refinery
also damaged company cars Friday, but it did not say how.
   Workers are demanding higher salaries and more fringe benefits
as Gabon enters the third year of an austerity program imposed as a
condition of further credit from Western nations and institutions.
   Many workers have been laid off in that time, but it is not
known how many of Gabon's 1 million people are out of work.
   The unrest also comes as the country holds a national conference
to draft constitutional changes to broaden democracy. Civilian
President Omar Bongo has ruled this oil-producing nation as a
one-party state since 1968.

<TEXT>
   About 100 Soviet military vehicles
rumbled past Lithuania's Parliament building early today, and
nervous lawmakers voted to transfer power out of their Baltic
republic if they are assaulted or arrested.
   After the convoy roared through, the Lithuanian capital was
quiet, and polls opened for elections to local governing councils.
   A deadline for Lithuanian deserters to return to their Soviet
military units passed with no immediate reports of action being
taken to round them up.
   In Moscow, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said two U.S. diplomats
ordered out of Lithuania by the Soviet government on Friday would
comply with the order. But he could not confirm the officials
actually had found transportation out of the Baltic republic and
left.
   In referring to today's maneuver, Lithuanian President Vytautus
Landsbergis told the Supreme Council legislature: ``We felt we were
really in an occupied country. An alien power sent forces and we
don't know why.
   ``Tension is rising with this demonstration of military force,
with this frightening of people with Soviet soldiers.''
   The legislators, who were in session about 300 feet from the
path of the convoy when it rumbled through Vilnius about 4 a.m.,
passed a resolution transferring power to the senior diplomat of
independent Lithuania in Washington in case of a Soviet assault or
their arrests.
   Since Lithuania declared independence from Moscow on March 11,
Soviet leaders have repeatedly warned the Baltic republic to return
to the Soviet Union. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called the
move illegal but said he would not use force against the republic
of 3.8 million people.
   Lithuania, a formerly independent republic, was crushed by
Stalin's army in 1940 and annexed by the Soviet Union.
   Moving the column into Vilnius increased the military pressure
on the Lithuanian government by making it simpler for Moscow to
send the troops quickly into action. But it appeared calculated to
enter the city when it was deserted, seemingly to avoid
confrontations.
   ``This is absurd, armored vehicles don't usually drive through
the middle of town in the middle of the night,'' Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimeira Prunskeine told reporters at the legislature.
   ``We're not afraid, but we don't know what they want, and we
don't know what they will do in the next few hours,'' she said.
   Official Lithuanian sources said vehicles containing at least
1,000 paratroopers armed with automatic weapons rumbled along the
main highway through the heart of Vilnius without stopping.
   There were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers and
dozens of green military trucks. The parliament's information
department quoted witnesses as saying there were 59 tanks and 50
other vehicles. No incidents were reported.
   A spokesman for the Lithuanian Parliament said he saw the column
enter a military base at Siaures Miestelis on the north side of the
capital, where it stayed.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev told Landsbergis that Lithuania should
stop signing up volunteer forces, and sought a response from the
Lithuanian leader by today. He also has demanded Lithuanians
surrender their firearms.
   A senior military adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, indicated Friday the
military would try to round up the deserters, ``even if some people
don't like it.''
   Landsbergis, in a telegram to Moscow early today, said the
volunteers would not replace Soviet KGB border guards and uniformed
police, as Gorbachev suggested the Lithuanians would.
   Romas Gudaitis, a Lithuanian representative to the national
parliament in Moscow, said he handed a letter Friday to Gorbachev's
second-in-command, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, asking national legislators
for negotiations.
   He said Lukyanov, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet,
categorically rejected the request.
   On Friday, Foreign Ministry officials said Soviet embassies
would review foreigners' visa applications to travel to Lithuania,
to keep out people ``inclined to engage in illegal activities,''
the official Soviet news agency Tass said. It did not elaborate.
   The Soviet Union also told Poland it was suspending visa-free
travel for Poles and Lithuanians across the border, the official
Soviet news agency said.
   In Tokyo, the head of Tass said today he believes that a state
of emergency might be declared in Lithuania, although it was
unclear what that would mean.
   ``Just because they have formed a (independent) legislature,
they are mistaken to think that they can secede,'' Tass President
Leonid Kravchenko told the Japanese NTV television network.

<TEXT>
   Local Roman Catholic leaders
say they hope Monsignor Oscar Romero, murdered in church 10 years
ago today, will be declared a saint by the Vatican.
   ``Monsignor Romero is already a saint for the people of Latin
America. What the Vatican does would be a recognition of his
popular canonization,'' said Father Rogelio Pedraz, a close friend
and colleague of Romero.
   Local and foreign religious dignitaries attended ceremonies
Thursday, Friday and today for Romero, who was slain by a single
bullet through the heart as he said Mass at a hospital chapel March
24, 1980. The killing was blamed on right-wing death squads, but no
suspects were ever arrested.
   In Rome today, Pope John Paul II sent a message to Romero's
successor, Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas, expressing the hope that
the slaying will serve as a call to ``reconciliation and pardon.''
The message did not mention efforts to make Romero a saint.
   In announcing plans to propose Romero for beatification, the
first step toward sainthood, the church has instructed its
officials to ensure observation of the ``non cultu'' edict. That is
a reference to a decree Pope Urban VIII issued in the 17th century
that public ceremonial tribute to a candidate for sainthood would
diminish the nominee's chances.
   Only one archbishop delared a saint was assassinated in church _
Thomas Becket, killed 820 years ago by four local knights who
supported Henry II's feud with the cleric.
   Pedraz, director of the publishing house of the Jesuit-run
Central American University, says canonization could take up to 30
years.
   ``What Monsignor Romero finally leaves us as a lesson is that it
is not possible to kill him,'' said Juan Jose Garcia, director of
the university's human rights institute.
   ``The figure of Monsignor Romero does not end when he dies.
There begins the process of his resurrection, a resurrection that
means his return to life in today's circumstances.''
   To the despair of 5 million Salvadorans, today's circumstances
do not differ greatly from those of 1980, when the country was
descending into fratricidal war.
   ``It is a great sadness that, 10 years after the murder of one
who spoke with such passion of the need for peace, El Salvador is
still locked firmly in the embrace of mutual enmity and fierce
civil war,'' said the New York-based rights organization Americas
Watch. The group commented in a report titled ``A Year of
Reckoning: El Salvador a Decade after the Assassination of
Archbishop Romero.''
   Cruel irony attends the 10th anniversary.
   The nation is governed by the rightist Arena party founded by
cashiered army major Roberto D'Aubuisson. Former President Jose
Napoleon Duarte accused him of being mastermind of the conspiracy
to kill Romero.
   D'Aubuisson denies involvement in the murder.
   Despite evidence incriminating several alleged members in a
far-rightist plot, no one has been arrested or tried for the
slaying. Some officials have called the case closed.
   The anniversary comes just four months after another heinous
crime against men of the cloth.
   Before dawn on Nov. 16, army troops broke into the residence of
six Jesuit professor-priests at Central American University, roused
them from their beds, forced them to lie face down on the lawn and
shot them in the head. Then they killed the priests' housekeeper
and her daughter.
   ``These two events _ the murder of Archbishop Romero in 1980 and
the slaying of the Jesuits in 1989 _ stand as bookends to the
decade offering harsh testimony about who really rules El Salvador
and how little they have changed,'' Americas Watch said. ``Ten
years later, priest-killing is still a preferred option for those
who simply will not hear the cries for change and justice in a
society that has had too little of either.''
   Romero and the Jesuits exercised what in modern theology has
come to be called ``the preferential option for the poor.'' They
lived humbly and described and condemned exploitation, inequality,
oppression and repression. For their outspokenness, they were
labeled subversives by the radical right.
   Romero ``was a pastor, a prophet, a friend, a brother and a
father to the entire Salvadoran people, especially the poorest, the
weakest and most downtrodden,'' the local church said in a
publication dedicated to his memory. ``He was the voice of those
without voice.''
   The day before he was killed, in his final homily, Romero issued
an impassioned appeal to soldiers to disobey orders to torture and
murder.
   ``In the name of God, in the name of this suffering people whose
cries rise to heaven more loudly each day, I implore you, I beg
you, I order you in the name of God: Stop the repression,'' he said.
   The government and rebels in recent weeks have talked separately
with a representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar about resuming peace talks broken off last November.
   ``We hope that in the year of this 10th anniversary the war
ends,'' said Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of
San Salvador. ``Because it is possible to end the war this very
year, the year of the beginning of his canonization. He told us how
we could have avoided all this suffering, but his voice was not
heeded. We hope that now, with more serenity, his voice will be
heeded and that finally the violence will end and peace will
arrive.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
failed to make much progress toward producing a new cease-fire in
the 15-year-old Angolan civil war, a senior U.S. official said
today.
   But Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the
United States and Soviet Union had agreed to ``exert all our
efforts'' to encourage peace in southern Africa.
   Baker, on the last leg of his six-day trip through Africa that
included stops in South Africa and newly independent Namibia, met
with Angolan rebel and government leaders to seek a solution to
their long conflict.
   ``The Angolans are still proposing what they call a Biafran
solution,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The official was referring to Nigeria's policy toward defeated
rebels who had sought independence for the country's eastern region
in the 1960s. Nigeria brought many former rebels into the federal
government, giving them a voice in national affairs.
   ``But the Angolan rebels haven't been defeated,'' the U.S.
official said. Guerrilla forces loyal to Jonas Savimbi control
about one-third of the mineral-rich country in southwestern Africa.
   Baker held brief talks with Savimbi on Friday night. Savimbi,
who has been supported by the United States, repeated a pledge to
honor a cease-fire if the Angolan government would begin
negotiations to end the war.
   Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko received Baker today on his
riverboat, the Kamanyola, on the Congo River. Mobutu has sought to
mediate the Angolan conflict, but a cease-fire he brokered in June
quickly broke down.
   Baker refused to comment on the talks except to say: ``We had
almost three hours that were constructive and helpful.''
   In Harare, Zimbabwe, Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union was
optimistic about the prospects of peace in Angola and Mozambique,
where guerrillas are fighting the Soviet-backed governments.
   ``There is a certain degree of readiness by both the leaders of
these countries and their opponents to engage in dialogue,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Meanwhile, two attorneys of the U.S. Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights accused Zairean security forces of attacking them and
stealing their briefcases on March 15.
   The New York-based committee said in a letter to Baker that five
men beat Americans Peter Rosenblum and Kenyan Makau Mutua outside
their hotel in downtown Kinshasa.
   Bystanders chased the attackers but abandoned their pursuit when
one shouted that he belonged to the security forces, the letter
said. Zaire's intelligence service denied it was involved in the
attack.
   The letter asked Baker to raise the incident in today's talks
with Mobutu. Baker did not say whether he had, but the talks were
to have included bilateral relations.
   Zaire is a top beneficiary of aid from the United States.
   Amnesty International, the human rights organization, has for
years accused Mobutu's administration of arbitrarily detaining and
torturing opponents.

   The opening of the Berlin Wall in November
helped make 1989 a record year for tourism in West Berlin,
according to a report published Saturday.
   The West Berlin Statistics Office said 2.4 million visitors came
to West Berlin in 1989, a 12 percent increase over 1988.
   The figures do not include visitors from East Germany or
tourists who did not stay in hotels, the report said.
   The Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9 at the height of the
pro-democracy revolution.
   The number of tourists skyrocketed in December, when 183,000
registered visitors came to West Berlin. It was an increase of 48
percent over December 1988.
   Americans led the number of foreign visitors, with 8,200,
followed by 6,000 Dutch, 5,700 British and 4,700 French tourists.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Screen, stage and television actress Alice Sapritch
died Saturday of a heart attack, police said. She was 73.
   The black-haired Armenian actress, born in Istanbul in 1916, cut
a familiar figure on the Left Bank for decades, with a turban atop
her head and cigarette held firmly between her fingers.
   Ms. Sapritch arrived in France in the early 1930s to study drama
at the prestigious National Conservatory. By 1939, her imposing
presence landed her the role of Hamlet's mother.
   She worked on stage through the 1940s, appearing in ``The
Dialogue of the Carmelites'' and ``L'Aiglon.'' Her stage work
continued into the 1970s, but her real success came in movies and
television.
   Her work on the screen included ``Who is Polly Magoo?'' in 1966,
``The Folly of the Great'' in 1971, ``The Concierge'' in 1973,
``The Brontes'' in 1979, and ``Adam and Eve'' in 1984.''
   Sapritch married the journalist and dramatist Guillaume Hanoteau
in 1950. They divorced 22 years later. The couple had no children.

<HEAD>Christian Clashes Raise Fears of All-Out War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled with
artillery and machine guns through the night and again Saturday,
raising fears of a new round of all-out war for control of
Christian territory.
   Three people were reported killed and eight wounded in the
battles, which took place in east Beirut and in the Kesrouan
province north of the city. Most of the victims have been civilians.
   The clashes were the most serious since a cease-fire was
declared March 3 between the troops of Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces Militia. The truce has been violated
repeatedly.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, predicted all-out warfare would break out again if a
mediation committee is unable to work out a political settlement
between the rival Christian groups.
   A Christian source close to the mediators said: ``The gap
separating Geagea and Aoun remains very wide. The mediators haven't
been able to bring them closer.''
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
committee was ``convinced that its efforts have reached a dead end,
but doesn't want to announce failure, hoping that a miracle of some
sort might emerge.''
   Meanwhile, Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily quoted unnamed
government sources as saying the United States has informed
``officials that Aoun must step down in favor of the legitimate
authority'' of President Elias Hrawi. It did not elaborate.
   The United States, like all nations with which Lebanon has
diplomatic relations, recognizes Hrawi as head of state.
   Aoun refuses to accept his authority because he was elected as
part of a peace accord the Christian general opposed. Aoun rejected
the accord because it did not include a timetable for the
withdrawal from Lebanon of Syrian troops.
   Aoun considers the Syrians, who entered Lebanon in 1976 under an
Arab League peacekeeping mandate, to be an army of occupation.
   Geagea recognizes the presidency and has made cautious signals
welcoming the peace accord.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio quoted unnamed government
sources as saying the government was considering ``ways of
intervening to stop the intra-Christian fighting amid increasing
signs that a fierce confrontation might break out.'' It did not say
whether this might involve military action against Aoun.

<HEAD>Alec McCowen Recites `St. Mark's Gospel'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The respected British actor Alec McCowen is
back, again reciting ``St. Mark's Gospel,'' and it is mesmerizing.
   The solo performance opened Wednesday night, to play through
April 15, at the off-Broadway Lamb's Theater.
   McCowen learned the second and shortest of the four Gospels in
the New Testament of the Bible during 16 months in 1976 and 1977.
He has been occasionally speaking it in theaters ever since,
including previous engagements here.
   He is ``acting'' more now. Previously, he delivered the story
primarily by voice. And there are more props. Instead of one chair,
there are now three which he moves around.
   When Jesus is on a ship, the actor turns a chair and sits on it
backwards. When a madman speaks, his hand goes in front of his
face, palm out. When a blind man speaks, a hand covers his eyes.
Temple officials speak with plummy, self-satisfied voice and
expression.
   This makes surprisingly little difference. ``St. Mark's Gospel''
fascinates however McCowen delivers it, to a audience familiar with
its story or not, believers or not, first-time hearers or those
who've heard it before.
   This Gospel concentrates on Jesus' ministry. He is baptized by
John the Baptist, chooses his disciples, goes to many villages to
cast demons out of people, cures illnesses and handicaps and
teaches by telling parables. In this Gospel, the common people
figure out the parables better than the disciples.
   This Gospel doesn't have many women in it. Jesus' mother isn't
mentioned. The stories of Mary Magdalene, Mary and Martha and the
woman at the well aren't told. The writing style is never flowery.
   McCowen's hair now is gray; his closely trimmed beard is white.
He doesn't wear a suit, as when he first did ``St. Mark's Gospel''
here. Now he wears a dark red sweater over a shirt and gray slacks.
   In an introduction he explains that he uses the 1611 King James
version of the Bible. He says that Peter is believed to have told
this story to Mark.
   One thing that McCowen's acting has done is to give ``St. Mark's
Gospel'' more amusing moments than before. Before James and John
ask Jesus if they can sit beside him in heaven, he looks all around
to see if anybody is eavesdropping.
   Arthur Cantor produced. Lloyd Sobel did the subtle lighting.

<TEXT>
   When the principal at J.C. Nalle Elementary
School recently asked for community volunteers to sub for her
teachers at lunch time, more than two-dozen parents jumped right in.
   For the teachers, it was a welcome opportunity to grab a
90-minute break from the rigors of an innner-city school day. For
parents, it was a gratifying means of getting involved in the
education of their children.
   ``The parents came in overwhelmingly,'' school principal Shirley
Williams said of the lunch program, which was designed to honor
teachers during American Education Week. ``And the teachers were
pleased.''
   Stronger parental involvement in schools is a key aim of the
national education strategy developed by the Bush administration
and the nation's governors. The policy stresses that ``parents
should play an active role in their children's early learning.''
   But instituting such a policy in the drug-infested neighborhoods
surrounding Nalle is no mean feat.
   Nearby Drake Place was described by Time magazine as one of the
nation's meanest streets.
   ``Many children at Nalle at one time or another have been a
witness to a crime or have been affected by a crime,'' said Ms.
Williams, noting the drug epidemic has torn down traditional family
structures.
   Yet, said the Rev. Nathaniel Thomas, president of the school's
Parent Teacher Association, ``In spite of the drug abuse or other
conditions, parents still want the very best for their children.
But the challenge is how to help them and how to get us the
necessary support.''
   Most of the parents are in their early to mid-20s _ ``so very
young themselves that they are seeking guidance as well,'' he said.
   Thomas, who has a daughter at Nalle, said he became active at
the school about the time Ms. Williams became principal because ``I
attended the school as a child and my parents still live in this
community.''
   ``I refuse to run away from my roots,'' he said. ``This is where
the seed was planted, right here. In spite of all the problems that
exist now we can change that by way of a cooperative network among
the teachers, principal and parents.''
   President Bush recently criticized parents for ``thinking of
education as a service we can hand over to the school boards, much
the same way we expect our cities to provide electricity or water.''
   Bush's criticisms came as the national PTA released a survey of
parents that found less than half had visited their children's
schools to participate in a back-to-school night or to attend
parent-organization meetings last fall.
   Many of the parents cited lack of time or work commitments as a
deterrent to participation.
   Parents of the 413 black students attending J.C. Nalle have
additional problems. The school is located in a neighborhood where,
during the 1988-89 school year, ``there was a crime committed there
almost every night,'' Ms. Williams said. Some parents struggle
themselves with drug and alcohol problems.
   To ensure parental awareness of a student's progress, Ms.
Williams requires parents must pick up their children's report
card. Only a few refuse to do so.
   ``Just today one little boy was just beaming because his mother
was here to pick up his report card,'' said Ms. Williams. ``It
didn't matter that she was more than a month late.''
   Ms. Willians, who has been principal at Nalle for the past 18
months, said the ``key is getting them (parents) to trust you and
letting them know that they are welcome in the schools, that you
have the same concern for their children and that the staff is
flexible, willing to listen and help their children be successful.''
   The first challenge for Ms. Williams and Thomas has been to
establish an active PTA. But few parents can afford to supplement
many of the extracurricular activities school officials insist are
essential, so Ms. Williams and other school officials are searching
for corporate sponsors too.
   Thomas has persuaded Howard University's School of Education to
establish a partnership with Nalle to provide educational
counseling, staff development and cultural enrichment opportunities
for faculty, students and parents.
   Nalle currently has five ``parent partners'' assisting teachers
in the school. The parents usually start out as volunteers and
later are paid small stipends to work about four hours twice a week.
   Helen Williams, a parent who has volunteered, worked as a parent
partner and now is an aide. She has a fifth grader at Nalle, and
her oldest son attended.
   ``I know a lot of parents who don't work and could come up and
help the teachers,'' said Mrs. Williams, who is not related to the
principal. ``But a lot of them didn't finish school and figure they
can't teach the children because they don't know a lot of things
themselves.''
   Ms. Williams, the principal, said some of the parents have
values different from those taught in the school.
   ``Children go by peer pressure and the code of the street. You
don't talk about things that go on,'' she said. ``But those things
cannot exist here at a public school. You come in and if there's a
problem we will talk about it. We're going to listen and we're
going to try to guide the kid to understand. We don't want to put
the home down, but as I say to parents, `We have a standard and we
must measure up to the standard.'''

   Scores of unemployed people went on a
rampage in Gabon's economic capital of Port Gentil, breaking shop
windows, looting stores and setting cars aflame, the state-run
Union newspaper reported Saturday.
   The daily newspaper said numerous people were wounded and many
shops and schools shut down before the unrest ended Friday
afternoon, several hours after it began.
   Security forces were dispatched from the capital, Libreville, to
reinforce those in Port Gentil, it said.
   This oil-producing country is in the third year of an austerity
program imposed as a condition of receiving further credit from
Western nations and institutions. Workers are demanding higher
salaries and more fringe benefits.
   Many workers have been laid off in recent months, but it is not
known how many of Gabon's 1 million people are unemployed.

   The White House will review all the
government's overseas broadcasts to determine what changes should
be made in response to political upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   The review, to be headed by the National Security Council, will
examine the radio programs of the Voice of America and of Radio
Free Europe and Radio Liberty, according to a letter from President
Bush's National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``The President strongly shares your view that the dramatic
opening of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union requires us to look
afresh at all our broadcasting activities,'' Scowcroft wrote Rep.
Dante Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Among its other tasks, the review panel will consider a
suggestion by Fascell that a presidential commission be appointed
to offer recommendations about the long-term future of the radio
stations, Scowcroft said.
   Since World War II, the administration has used its radio
stations as instruments of foreign policy to influence events
around the world, especially in Communist countries. An alternative
to the strict state-controlled media in those countries, the
American stations drew a clandestine following of millions of
listeners. The U.S. programs were often jammed.
   VOA broadcasts in 43 languages around the world. Radio Free
Europe-Radio Liberty, based in Munich, targets only Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union. Their combined budgets are about $400 million.
   The stations have already begun changing programming to reflect
the changes in the Communist world. Growing emphasis has been
placed on ``how-to'' programs that instruct listeners in one-time
Communist countries about life in the Western world.
   Special emphasis is placed on programs about starting up
businesses and call-in shows with experts on such subjects as
writing constitutions and laws.
   Members of Congress have proposed a bill that would re-examine
the direction of the government's broadcasting, which has been hit
by increasing budget problems in recent years.
   Testifying at a House hearing on the subject last week, Rep.
James Scheuer, D-N.Y., urged that the mission of the radio stations
be changed.
   ``It simply doesn't make sense to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars to increase our ability to penetrate Eastern Europe ...
when they probably will be showing the CBS Evening News or CNN _
and probably even The Cosby Show'' on their networks within a few
years, Scheuer said.

<TEXT>
   Australians voted in parliamentary
elections today, and preliminary returns showed a tie between Prime
Minister Bob Hawke's governing Labor Party and Andrew Peacock's
conservative opposition.
   Hawke said he will remain as a caretaker prime minister until
official election results are released. The voting was so close,
the election may not be decided until Thursday when postal ballots
are counted.
   Computer projections gave Hawke's ruling party 73 seats _ two
short of the majority it needs to form a government in the 148-seat
House of Representatives. Peacock's coalition was also expected to
capture 73 seats, with independents taking parliament's other two
seats.
   A preliminary count of 82 percent of the ballots also showed the
Liberal and Labor parties running neck-and-neck, television
stations said.
   Labor had 85 seats entering the election; Peacock's Liberal
Party, 45; and its coalition partner, the National Party, 18 seats.
   Speaking to reporters after the ballots closed Hawke sounded
confident that his party would win an unprecedented fourth
consecutive term.
   ``When the counting is finalized, I will, on behalf of the
Australian Labor Party, be in a position to form a government,'' he
said.
   But Peacock also said that he was optimistic that his party
would capture the vote. ``I still think we are in with a very
decent chance,'' said Peacock, who is making his second bid for
prime minister.
   ``We are quite optimistic and believe we will shortly be in a
position to form a government,'' he said.
   Television commentators said the election could be decided by
2,500 voters stranded by a hurricane in Kennedy, a small town in
the northern state of Queensland. They will cast their votes on
Sunday when floodwaters clear.
   Forty of the 70 Senate seats were also contested today,but the
results will probably not be known for two weeks because of the
complicated voting system.
   Australia has 10.6 million eligible voters among its 16.5
million people, and voting is compulsory.
   The election concentrated on Australia's economic policies, and
an opposition victory would not dramatically affect foreign policy.
   Australia is a close U.S. ally, and President Bush said he hoped
to visit the country before the year's end.
   Hawke said a victory for his 7-year-old administration would
allow it to complete its economic reforms.
   Australia's sagging economy has been the focus of a largely
uneventful five-week campaign during which Peacock claimed Hawke's
policies weren't working and that the country faced a recession.
   Hawke, the nation's most enduring and popular Labor Party
leader, campaigned on his record of economic reform, even though
the foreign debt has grown to $100 billion.
   Peacock has criticized the government because of the country's
high home mortgage interest rates, now at a record 18 percent.
   Hawke came to power in 1983, was re-elected the following year
and again in 1987. He has said that, if re-elected in this race, he
will seek a fifth term before retiring.

<TEXT>
   When Swedes voted in a referendum 10
years ago to phase out nuclear energy, they thought they put the
question to rest.
   They were wrong.
   Many in this country, which depends on nuclear power for half
its electricity, are having second thoughts about the decision to
stop building new reactors and to close the 12 existing atomic
power stations by the year 2010.
   A recent poll said 54 percent of 2,500 Swedes queried wanted to
keep nuclear power after 2010, compared with 30 percent four years
ago.
   Friday was the 10th anniversary of the passage of the
referendum. It brought new calls to rethink the idea of closing the
first reactor in 1995 and a second in 1996.
   In a possible sign they want to back out of the timetable,
Environment Minister Birgitta Dahl and Industry Minister Rune Molin
wrote in a joint article that their No. 1 priority was to protect
full employment.
   ``The day the dismantling leads to loss of jobs, factories
closing and rationing electricity, the nuclear power lobby will win
its strongest arguments,'' they wrote in Friday's Dagens Nyheter
daily.
   The two, who have been at loggerheads in the past over energy
policy, promised to come up with a long-term strategy later this
year.
   Advocates of nuclear power cite tightened safety regulations.
``The safety and security have been extraordinarily good,'' said Bo
Wergens, a leader in Sweden's profitable pulp and paper industry.
It relies heavily on nuclear power, which is relatively cheap.
   Critics note that in Sweden's frigid climate, most homes are
overheated and homeowners barely notice the bill. By some
estimates, closing the stations would double the consumer cost of
electricity.
   The debate on nuclear energy dominated politics here for nearly
a decade. It was partly responsible for the ouster of the Social
Democrats in 1976 after 44 unbroken years in power.
   The issue is still so contentious that the three non-socialist
opposition parties failed to unite in a coalition last month to
replace the Social Democrats, who quit over economic policy. The
Social Democrats returned to office by default.
   The 1980 referendum was called a few months after the nuclear
accident at Three Mile Island in the United States. Reinforcement
came in 1986, when the explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the
Soviet Union sent a cloud of contamination over central Sweden.
   But despite lessened fears today, the anti-nuclear lobby is
still strong. Dozens of black-clad women gathered outside Prime
Minister Ingvar Carlsson's office Friday, carrying pictures of
children over the slogan: ``Innocents in a radioactive world.''
   ``We think nuclear power is dangerous, that Sweden and all other
countries should abstain from it as soon as possible,'' said
Christer Skaneberg, a legislator for the Environment Party.
   ``The right signal would be for the government to close one
reactor this year,'' said Lennart Daleus, arguing that Sweden has a
surplus of energy. Daleus led the anti-nuclear campaign in the
referendum.
   The government has been debating how to replace nuclear power.
   The other half of Sweden's power is hydroelectric, but the
environmentally conscious Swedes also passed legislation forbidding
the exploitation of the remaining pristine rivers of northern
Sweden.
   Concerns of global warming, which scientists believe is caused
by high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, prompted other
regulations to reduce emissions. Oil-fueled stations, which in the
1970s supplied 40 percent of the electricity, today are used as
peak-hour supplements.

<HEAD>Thatcher Revolution Hits Its Roughest Patch</HEAD>

   In the streets, tax protesters burn Margaret
Thatcher's effigy, and in the inner sanctums of her nervous
Conservative Party there is talk of trying to dump her this autumn.
   In the latest blow, the Conservatives have suffered their most
spectacular by-election defeat in 50 years, losing the
traditionally staunch Tory district of Mid-Staffordshire to the
opposition Labor Party by a landslide.
   Even after Friday's humiliation, Mrs. Thatcher's closest
supporters are convinced she will ultimately triumph. But the
Thatcherite free-market revolution has hit its roughest patch since
she swept to power in 1979.
   Mrs. Thatcher has weathered tough spells before. But this time,
things look dangerously different for the prime minister who has
dominated Britain through the 1980s and challenged every
institution, from the welfare state, through lawyers' monopolies to
the labor unions.
   What began as a blip in inflation in the spring of 1988 has
burgeoned into a crisis undermining the core of her political
success: the sense she gave millions of Britons _ even those who
did not like her _ that they were better off with her.
   Thatcher aides argue that the by-election defeat was largely a
traditional mid-term protest. But it is an ominous protest in which
a Tory majority of 14,654 became a Labor majority of 9,449 _ a
swing of 21.4 percent.
   ``There was never a widespread acceptance of her enterprise
culture,'' Robert Skidelsky, professor of international studies at
Warwick University, said in an interview.
   ``But she was accepted as a very strong leader, someone who had
got the economy under control and brought a tremendous increase in
living standards in real terms. ... Suddenly all that has started
to come unstuck and her strongest claim to rule is undermined.''
   In the past 20 months, a doubling of interest rates in an
attempt to curb inflation has sent the cost of home loans and other
credit soaring.
   Hardest-hit are millions of new homeowners, small businesses and
skilled blue-collar workers _ people who symbolize Thatcherism
itself.
   Meanwhile inflation, just 3.3 percent two years ago, remains
above 7 percent.
   ``In the beginning I thought her ideas were brilliant,'' said
Sheila Jackson, who lives with her husband, a $230-a-week
plasterer, and two children on a public housing estate in Weymouth,
southern England.
   ``We were going to buy our house this year. Now that's on hold
because of the interest payments ... you feel you're getting
nowhere with her. I'm ashamed to say I voted for her.''
   This sudden loss of spending power is worsened by a property tax
reform that was supposed to be Thatcherism's master stroke, but is
looking like a serious political miscalculation.
   By changing the system from graded levies on property to a
straight head tax on every adult, Mrs. Thatcher thought she could
show voters that Tories run local government more cheaply than the
Labor socialists.
   Instead, the so-called poll tax is costing the average household
about one-third more _ $1,107 _ from April 1.
   Demonstrators have fought running battles with police and
invaded town halls all over England. The Conservatives have sunk to
their lowest ratings for nearly two decades, 21 points behind Labor.
   The 64-year-old prime minister faces a fundamental quandary. She
has built her prestige on a refusal to shirk unpopular measures for
the sake of popularity. To back down is simply not in her nature.
   But unless she relents on the tax, she will alienate voters as
well as members of her own party, who fear for their seats in the
next election.
   Many Britons have long regarded Europe's first woman prime
minister as dogmatic, bossy and extreme. Surveys marking her 10th
anniversary in power last May showed majorities still oppose some
key tenets of her mission to demolish socialism, such as selling
off state-owned industries and reforming the national health,
education and legal systems.
   But until now, the grocer's daughter from Grantham, central
England, could demonstrate that whatever the intelligentsia
thought, she was in touch with ordinary people: tough on crime,
patriotic enough to wage war for an obscure colony like the
Falkland Islands, strong enough to face down powerful trade unions.
   The new tax has made even her staunchest supporters wonder.
   ``It was a blunder, putting at risk for the first time Mrs.
Thatcher's claim to be the authentic voice of middle England,''
Peregrine Worsthorne commented in London's right-wing Sunday
Telegraph.
   No one is writing off Mrs. Thatcher's chances of leading the
Conservatives to an unprecedented fourth successive victory at the
next election, which must be held by mid-1992.
   ``I am very happy in the business I do, very happy indeed,'' she
said recently.
   Last November, however, she faced a challenger for the first
time at the annual election of party leader. Although she won
handsomely, there is now at least a possibility her critics will
try again this year. If she loses, she automatically ceases to be
prime minister.
   ``The idea that Mrs. Margaret Thatcher may no longer be prime
minister by the autumn must now be taken seriously,'' said the
respected weekly, The Economist.
   The favorite as successor is Michael Heseltine, 57, a
charismatic former defense secretary who projects himself as the
Tory who will usher in a kinder, gentler post-Thatcherite age.
   Thatcher aides argue that inflation and interest rates will
inevitably fall by year's end, if only because the government must
create a pre-election recovery. But even then, Mrs. Thatcher seems
in for a much tougher ride.
   She is in some ways a victim of her own successes.
   Many Britons have forgotten or never knew life without her, when
Britain was plagued by strikes, inflation touched 26 percent and
the top income tax rate was 83 percent.
   Now, more than two-thirds of Britons own their homes, compared
with 50 percent in 1979. Stock holders have trebled to 9 million,
largely through sales of state-owned enterprises, including British
Airways, the national phone company, and British Gas.
   The average Briton's earnings, now $388 a week, have risen by 26
percent in real terms since 1979, according to official figures.

<HEAD>Report On Soviet Internment Camp Where Thousands Died</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East German newspaper on Saturday reported
the discovery of mass graves of thousands of people who died at a
former Soviet prison camp set up after World War II. It said many
were innocent civilians.
   The dead included Nazi war prisoners, such as members of the
paramilitary SS, Nazi party officials and soldiers in Hitler's
army, Berliner Zeitung reported.
   But among the victims were ``many innocent people'' and
children, it reported. The youngest victim was 12 years old, it
quoted a surviving inmate as saying. There was no word on how the
victims died.
   A local historian discovered the remains this month at the camp,
which was in Fuenfeichen, 80 miles north of East Berlin. It was run
by the dreaded NKVD state security force, a forerunner of the
Soviet KGB, according to the report.
   Berliner Zeitung quoted West German estimates that 65,000 men,
women and children died in Red Army imprisonment at the end of
World War II. It likened the ``Stalinist terror'' to Nazi death
camps.
   The report, accompanied by a graphic photograph of a skeleton,
would have been impossible until the peaceful revolt that toppled
East Germany's hard-line Communist regime in October and set the
country on course for democracy.
   East Germany, formed out of Soviet-occupied Germany after the
fall of Hitler's Third Reich, was a particularly staunch Soviet
ally for decades but now is dealing publicly with its past. This
includes reports on brutality in the postwar period, when the
Soviet bloc was in the iron grip of Kremlin chief Josef Stalin.
   Berliner Zeitung noted that many German Communists and
socialists were also killed in Soviet camps.
   Nearby residents and farmers knew about Fuenfeichen but kept
silent until now, the paper said.
   The camp was in operation from April 1945 until October 1948.
Many inmates were taken to the Soviet Union when the Red Army
closed the camp and were never heard from again, the report said.
   It said one prisoner who died had just been released from a Nazi
camp and was arrested by the Soviets because he resisted the
expropriation of his home.

<HEAD>Rural Kentucky Students Chat With Kids Across Globe Via Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WHEELWRIGHT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheelwright High School may be tucked in
a remote corner of rural eastern Kentucky, but these days its
students are trading information and greetings with counterparts
everywhere from Homer, Alaska, to Bogota and London.
   But these modern-day pen-pals are communicating by computer, not
paper and pen.
   Kisha Cotton, 17, wrote about growing up in a rural Appalachian
hollow and her first encounter with racism at a beauty pagent. The
essay was posted on a computer bulletin board and read by students
across the world. Miss Cotton, who is black, was astonished at some
of the responses.
   ``Some of the kids said they never met a black person or got a
letter from one,'' said Miss Cotton. ``Some of the kids didn't know
black kids went to school with white kids.''
   The experience will help her handle racism when she leaves home
for college next fall, she said.
   The computer conferences _ some carefully structured around a
single subject, others more loosely organized to allow students to
communicate on various topics _ are organized by the BreadNet
computer network, based at Middlebury College in Vermont. Schools
use their own computers to link up with the central computer at
Middlebury.
   A core group of about 60 schools is taking part in the general
program, while other schools are taking part in single-topic
conferences, said Hugh Coyle, administrative director of
Middlebury's Bread Loaf School of English.
   Students at Wheelwright High are amoung about 70 groups around
the world currently involved in a conference on environmental
issues, called ``World Class,'' said William W. Wright Jr.,
BreadNet director.
   ``It does bring some of the kids alive. It engages them and
sparks active learning,'' said Wright. ``Using technology this way
has engaged students in a way that ... video does not.''
   The participants here shared some of the messages received from
other countries. Some students in Toronto, Canada, facetiously
noted that ``it's hard to imagine that inside our freezing igloos
we find space for a computer.'' They added that they were taking
part in the environmental exchange ``to make the world a better and
cleaner place.''
   While the Canadians cited concerns about acid rain, a group of
geography students from the United Arab Emirates sent in
information about the land and history of the Middle East and the
environmental problems raised by rapid population growth and
pollution generated by the oil industry.
   Conferences run several weeks and follow a structured format.
Students read magazine articles and work in groups to pose
questions for experts or answer queries from other students. The
teams also use the network to research a specific topic, such as
depletion of the Earth's ozone layer.
   ``They send facts we don't know about and we send facts they
don't know about,'' said Haley Caudill, 18. ``Gathered with what we
have, it really helps with a better understanding.''
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., will be an ``on-line guest'' Monday
and Tuesday to respond to students' questions on the environment,
said Wright.
   BreadNet was created in 1984 as part of a summer graduate
program for rural high school teachers at Middlebury. Besides
letting students interact by computer, the network enables rural
teachers to stay abreast of changes in the their profession and
serves as a support group after they return home, said Wright.
   Wheelwright teacher Carol Stumbo, whose journalism class is
working on BreadNet, described the students' enthusiasm as
contagious.
   ``They have managed to get the entire school involved to some
degree,'' she said.
   ``Having them hooked up is very important because you can do two
things,'' Ms. Stumbo said. ``You can give them a sense of where
they're from and you can broaden them.''
   Principal Lonnie Slone called the computer conferences ``one of
the greatest things to happen at the school.''
   ``When you live in Floyd County at the head of Left Beaver, you
might feel a bit isolated,'' Sloan said. ``But with this system,
you're in a community.'' Inspired by environmental issues discussed
on BreadNet, Wheelwright students organized an essay contest and a
cleanup project on Beaver Creek, which runs in front of the school.
They persuaded the city council in this town of 850 people to
proclaim April 22 as Earth Day.
   Early next month, BreadNet will launch a writing conference
addressing racial stereotypes, called ``Across Ethnic Lines.''
Students in about 30 classrooms from Moscow, Idaho, to Lima, Peru,
will take part.
   Wheelwright High School students, still busy on their
environmental project, won't be participating in the ethnic
project. But just by participating in BreadNet, they have helped
weaken their own stereotype of eastern Kentucky as a region of
illiterate hillbillies, said Slone.
   ``They realize they're just like all other students all over the
world,'' said Slone.

   The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson today told moderate
and conservative Democrats hoping to guide their party back to the
White House that they must unite around the ``mainstream values''
of working Americans.
   ``The Democrats must find common ground as the party of those
who live on their paychecks,'' said Jackson who has twice sought
the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Jackson told the annual convention of the Democratic Leadership
Council that all factions of the party must come together. He said
that was possible because Democrats are increasingly united on such
issues as choice in abortion, fighting crime and drugs and
government aid to those in need.
   ``We're talking about mainstream values and that's a wider
stream than many thought,'' Jackson said. ``If it's morally right,
it can't be politically wrong for long.'' He also told the group,
however, that civil rights do not represent a privilege.
   Jackson said that in the past Democrats have questioned whether
they could win as ``the party of inclusion.'' He said some
progressives wanted to start a third party following Ronald
Reagan's victory and the Republican capture of the Senate a decade
ago.
   Meanwhile, Democrats ``argued that the party would benefit by
excluding or attacking so-called special interest.''
   ``We contended that we had to stay and build a rainbow
coalition,'' Jackson said. ``Make our party bigger and stronger.''
He said registration drives brought in a bumper crop of new voters
who helped the party regain control of the Senate in 1986.
   ``The mainstream is becoming a mighty river, uniting many
streams,'' Jackson said.
   Earlier, Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder told the group that all
Democrats must strongly support the party's presidential nominee in
1992.
   The meeting of the leadership council, formed by conservative
and moderate Democrats to counter the party's purported leftward
drift, occurs as the party's governing Democratic National
Committee continues its spring meeting in Indianapolis.
   Wilder, the nation's first black elected governor, told the
council, ``Those who lose our primaries must reject the temptation
to cling to a sense of personal injury and defeat. They must unite
behind the party's candidate.''
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a potential candidate in 1992, was
warmly received by the 900 people at the DLC conference Friday as
he led attacks on the Republican administration.
   Speakers accused President Bush of timidity in foreign policy
and hypocrisy on taxes. Bentsen said the president's proposed
budget contains $20 million in ``crypto-taxes'' disguised as user
fees, surcharges and other levies. He called Bush's repeated
no-new-taxes stance as ``pure bushlips.''
   Asked about 1992, he said he is not planning a run for the
presidency. The 69-year-old senator was the Democratic nominee for
vice president in 1988.
   Democratic Chairman Ron Brown divided his time Friday between
New Orleans and Indianapolis and denied the scheduling conflict
between the DLC and the DNC was a sign of party division.
   He also denied his disagreement with Bentsen over Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's proposed cut in Social Security payroll taxes
showed a lack of party unity.
   Brown called Friday for the party to endorse the Moynihan plan.
Bentsen said a rollback of last year's Social Security tax increase
might be in order, but that Moynihan's cut, at $50 billion, would
be too costly.
   ``Just because we don't have every `i' dotted and every `t'
crossed doesn't mean we are not unified,'' Brown said. ``We're
having an open and honest discussion about very complicated
Matters.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri chided Bush
for failing to react strongly to changes in Central America,
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``Our president refuses to risk not even one percentage point of
his 82 percent popularity polls to ask us to do what needs to be
done,'' Gephardt told the council.

<TEXT>
   The hatchings of two healthy California
condors late last week and the possibility of eight to 10 chicks in
all this breeding season could accelerate the program to return the
endangered species to the wild, a zoo official said.
   A 5.8-ounce bird named Kareya, from the Karok Indian word
meaning ``creator of all things,'' emerged at 4:30 a.m. Friday, the
first of the vulturelike chicks to hatch at the Los Angeles Zoo,
said spokeswoman Cindy Richardson. Its gender won't be known for
about three months.
   Kareya's hatching came only a little more than 24 hours after
the second chick of the 1990 breeding season, Honsi, was hatched
early Thursday at the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   It was less than two years ago that the first California condor
chick was hatched after being bred in captivity. A chick named
Molloko was hatched at San Diego on April 29, 1988, amid national
fanfare.
   The latest hatchings nudged the total population of the species
to 35, all in the two zoos. There were only 27 known California
condors when all were taken into captivity for breeding in 1987.
   Scientists are trying to breed enough of the birds, which can
have a wingspan of nearly 10 feet, to begin returning some to their
natural habitat.
   Wildlife officials had planned on releasing the first of the
condors sometime between 1993 and 1995. But Michael Wallace,
curator for birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, said the captive breeding
program has achieved such success that the first birds could be
released in the Los Padres National Forest next year.
   Officials hope to establish a wild flock there while they keep a
healthy captive flock, he said. Other release areas could include
the Grand Canyon or Northern California.
   Two eggs are under incubation in Los Angeles, and four in San
Diego, making for a possible record breeding season, Wallace said.
The incubation period for condor eggs is about two months.
   Under the captive breeding program, four chicks were hatched
last year, in addition to the one hatched in 1988. The condor's
breeding season runs from January through April. In 1984, eight
eggs were taken from the wild and hatched.
   ``We're hoping for between eight to 10 youngsters this year,''
Wallace said.
   Kareya, like Honsi, appeared healthy and hungry, zoo officials
said.
   ``It's had its first feeding of minced mice,'' Wallace said.

   The government deployed soldiers
across the troubled province of Kosovo to restore order Saturday
following renewed unrest sparked by a mysterious illness affecting
hundreds of ethnic Albanians.
   At the same time, the Serbian republic announced it was assuming
direct control of Kosovo's police, a move that could increase
tensions.
   The police force is dominated by ethnic Albanians, who form 90
percent of Kosovo's population. The minority Serbs and Montenegrins
have accused them of failing to provide adequate protection to
minority groups in Kosovo, a province within Serbia.
   More than 60 people have died in ethnic violence in the province
in the past year.
   The latest unrest was triggered by a mysterious illness that
hospitalized about 1,000 people, most of them ethnic Albanian
children and teen-agers, last week. The victims suffered lung and
skin irritation, and there were allegations by ethnic Albanians
they had been poisoned.
   Most of the patients had been released by Saturday, but hospital
sources said a few were still arriving for treatment.
   The cause of the illness had not been determined.
   A dozen military tanks were on the outskirts of Podujevo on
Saturday, 20 miles north of the provincial capital of Pristina.
Troop movements were also reported at Pec, Vucitrn, Titova
Mitrovica, Djakovica and Prizren, Radio Belgrade said.
   With an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population, Podujevo is
considered a hotbed of the group's struggle for the autonomy Kosovo
lost when Serbia assumed direct control of its judiciary and
education a year ago.
   A Western journalist who demanded anonymity said he saw police
headquarters in Podujevo surrounded Saturday by at least 40
policemen in battle gear. He said police carrying submachine guns
were all over the city.
   Jim Fish, a British reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp.,
told The Associated Press he was detained by police for two hours
and questioned when he returned to Podujevo following a visit to a
nearby village.
   He said he passed a column of tanks outside Podujevo.
   A French medical team was reported en route to Kosovo to try to
determine the cause of the mysterious illness.
   Serbian authorities have said there is no medical evidence to
back claims of poisoning, but ethnic Albanian activists on Friday
sought a second opinion. The Croatian daily newspaper Vjesnik
reported that at least one Serb policeman and one Serb schoolgirl
also sought treatment in Titova Mitrovica, north of Pristina, for
the illness.

   Fireworks stored in a shed caught fire
Saturday and erupted in a massive blast that killed at least 25
people and injured more than 70 at a festival in southern India,
news agencies reported.
   The fireworks were in a shed next to a Hundu temple and were to
be used in a fireworks competition marking the end of the 10-day
festival in Malanada, 1,380 miles south of New Delhi, United News
of India reported.
   Press Trust of Indian put the death toll at 25, but United News
said it was 26.
   The festival had been scheduled to end Friday night with a
shower of light in a competitive display by two major fireworks
manufacturers, United News said. But a heavy downpour delayed the
event.
   About 2:30 a.m. Saturday, fire broke out in the shed where one
company had stored its fireworks, the news agency reported. It said
many of the victims were employees of the fireworks company.
   Temple officials thought the fire might have been caused by a
short circuit in the shed, which had been provided with a temporary
electrical connection, United News said. But it said other sources
thought it was sparked by a cigarette discarded by someone seeking
shelter from the rain.

   A U.S. F-14 fighter plane suffered
minor damage Saturday when its front wheel gave out on landing and
it came to rest on its nose, a civil aviation official said.
   The official, who would only identify himself as Moreira, said
neither the pilot nor co-pilot was injured.
   Moreira said the F-14 was based on an aircraft carrier from
Recife, 1,500 miles northeast of Rio. The pilot landed at the

Moreira said.
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest commercial network, showed film of

   Paul Newman took the day off from his
salad dressing trial here to search for a site to locate a second
camp for children who are seriously ill.
   Newman has already established the Hole In The Wall Gang Camp in
Ashford. It entertains boys and girls ages 7 to 17 with cancer or
other life-threatening illnesses.
   Newman's lawyer, Leo Nevas, said Newman went to Florida on
Friday to scout locations for the second camp, which will also aid
children with serious diseases.
   ``All the seed money will come from him,'' Nevas said, while
others will provide donations to keep the camp going.
   Nevas said plans are also under way to site a third camp in
England, which would be supported with donations made overseas.
   Newman founded the Ashford camp in June 1988 on 300 acres around
a lake. His gourmet food company, Newman's Own Inc., donated $7
million in startup costs, while other funds were raised for
construction and an endowment.
   The camp offers horseback riding, boating, baseball, tennis and
other summer activities for youngsters, who are supervised by
medical professionals from Yale-New Haven Hospital.
   The camp was named after a gang of outlaws in the movie, ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' which starred Newman and Robert
Redford.
   Nevas was unsure when the second or third camps would be built.
   Newman and Newman's Own are being sued in Bridgeport Superior
Court by a Connecticut delicatessen owner who claims he was
promised stock for helping to launch the company. Newman denies any
deal.
   The Academy Award-winning actor took Friday off, but has been in
court since the trial began Tuesday. He's expected to testify this
week.

   ``The Marriage of Figaro'' set in the Trump Tower?
``Don Giovanni'' in Spanish Harlem? Avant garde director-playwright
Peter Sellars says ``Bravo!''
   Sellars, conductor Craig Smith and administrator Robert Canon
announced Friday the creation of a new company to stage the
productions at the Colonial Theater in January 1991.
   The group will stage five performances of Sellars' updated ``The
Marriage of Figaro,'' set in the Trump Tower and conducted by
Smith. The first full season will be in 1991 to 1992, according to
a news release.
   It will also include Sellars' ``Don Giovanni,'' set in Spanish
Harlem, and ``Cosi fan tutte,'' set in a diner on Cape Cod.
   Plans for Boston Opera Theater were released after months of
speculation that the trio would form a company after Canon resigned
as general manager of Sarah Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston in
April 1989.
   Canon said the company would feature modern productions of
standard repertory and development of new works by living American
composers.
   Sellars, the former director of the Boston Shakespeare Company,
is known for his unusual and often controversial stagings of plays
and operas.

   Master chef Julia Child thinks she knows how
to make broccoli pleasing to the presidential palate.
   Mrs. Child's ``Broccoli a la Bush'' involves blanching cut
broccoli, then sauteing it in olive oil and garlic. The garlic,
while not completely overpowering the vegetable, creates an
altogether different taste, she said.
   Mrs. Child whipped up a quick recipe using the vegetable banned
from the chief executive's plate on a WWDB-FM radio show on Friday
morning.
   ``President Bush would love to eat broccoli if it was prepared
in this way,'' Mrs. Child said.
   She called ``Broccoli a la Bush'' the first recipe created as a
solution to 10 tons of the vegetable the White House has received
from growers objecting to the president's decision to ban broccoli
from his plane, Air Force One.
   Mrs. Child, author of seven cookbooks, is on a 12-city tour for
the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food, discussing her philosophy on
cooking.
   Bush told reporters he hasn't liked broccoli ``since I was a
little kid and my mother made me eat it, and I'm president of the
United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli!''

receive his Nobel Peace Prize.
   Walesa arrives April 25, at the start of a Scandinavian trip

   Blues musicians such as Koko Taylor and the
Kinsey Report with Big Daddy Kinsey are planning to say so long to
one of their own this weekend.
   The musicians will gather Sunday at B.L.U.E.S. Etcetra for a
fund-raiser to help cover the medical and funeral costs for Larry
``Big Twist'' Nolan, who died March 14. He was 53.
   ``His songs also made me miss him,'' wife, Yvonne Nolan. ``Some
of his songs gave me the blues.''
   Ken Morton of Alligator Records, which recorded the album ``Big
Twist and the Mellow Fellows'' in Chicago, said the show would both
celebrate Nolan's memory and help raise money for his family.
   ``There undoubtedly will be a big turnout of musicians,'' he
said. ``There will be some kind of jam session at the end.''
   Sunday's lineup includes the Mellow Fellows, as well as Taylor,
Lonnie Brooks and the Kinsey group.
   Nolan, who once tipped the scales at 385 pounds, spent the
latter part of his life in excruciating pain, said guitarist and
bandleader Pete Special. For the past two years, he underwent
dialysis treatment, and more recently he underwent back surgery.

   Doctors took Richard Pryor out of
intensive care Saturday, four days after the actor-comedian
suffered a mild heart attack, hospital officials said.
   Pryor's agent said Pryor may resume his fishing vacation after
he is released from the hospital.
   Pryor, 49, was admitted to Wesley Hospital after suffering a
heart attack Tuesday. He was listed in stable condition Saturday.
The hospital administrator, Douglas Killer, said Pryor probably
would be discharged by Tuesday.
   ``He's fine and progressing well,'' the hospital official said.
``We're very pleased with him. It's given him quite a fright but
he's in good spirits.''
   Killer said the comedian was watching video cassettes in his
room.
   Pryor, star of ``Harlem Nights,'' ``Stir Crazy,'' and many other
films, collapsed while vacationing on the Gold Coast strip in
northeastern Australia. He was admitted to hospital with chest
pain, later diagnosed as a minor heart attack.
   His agent, Guy McElwaine, said Pryor was in Australia to fish on
the Great Barrier Reef for marlin ``and then planned to go to New
Zealand to fish for trout. He may still do that, depending on how
he's feeling.''
   The comedian was burned severely and nearly killed in 1980 while
freebasing cocaine, which involves heating the drug over an open
flame.
   He recounted that experience and other hardships in his life in
the films ``Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' and ``Jo Jo
Dancer, Your Life is Calling.''
   Other film credits include ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,''
``Brewster's Millions,'' ``Critical Condition,'' ``Richard Pryor
Here and Now,'' ``Richard Pryor Live in Concert'' and ``Richard
Pryor Is Back Live in Concert.''
   Pryor is due to start filming ``My Silent Partner'' with Gene
Wilder in May.

   As word of lawsuits against Nutri-System Inc.
spreads, the telephones at a law firm here handling the case are
getting a workout.
   Hundreds of calls have been logged from dieters complaining of
gallbladder problems or seeking information after shedding pounds
under the Nutri-System regime of specialty pre-packaged foods.
   ``This phone stays on my ear constantly,'' said attorney Robert
Fiore, who is representing some of the 19 women who filed separate
suits last week. ``We've received calls from all over the United
States and Canada. We're just trying to deal with the influx now.''
   The company defends its program as safe and says the gallbladder
problems are coincidental.
   Although Fiore said he was unprepared for the response, some
experts in diet and nutrition say they've spent years studying the
perils of obesity and rapid weight loss, both of which can affect
the gallbladder and blood pressure.
   But they say the popular Nutri-System program should not singled
out. It can provide several hundred more calories a day above some
liquid diets, the focus of several studies on gallbladder problems.
   ``As a nation we are grossly overweight and that is a problem in
itself,'' said Miami dietitian Joyce Julien. ``But often these
extremely low-calorie diets can lead to an increase in gallstones
and hypertension. I think these suits are just the tip of the
iceberg.''
   Presently, there are no direct federal regulations on the $5
billion a year commercial diet industry. On Monday, however, a
congressional committee will hold the first of a series of hearings
on those promising a quick path to slim bodies.
   Among those scheduled to testify before the Committee on Small
Business are Federal Trade Commission Chairman Janet Steiger,
several physicians and former followers of extremely low-calorie
diets _ some under 1,000 calories a day.
   ``It's a wide-open field right now,'' said D. Ann Murphy, a
staff member of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Regulation, Business
Opportunities and Energy. ``The public is so interested in quick
loss that there's tremendous opportunity for abuse.''
   Nutri-System has nearly 1,600 weight-loss centers in all 50
states, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. It offers a
1,000- to 1,500-calorie-a-day meal program and can cost several
hundred dollars to enroll, depending on weight-loss goals and
special promotions offered.
   The Dade Circuit Court suits against Nutri-System claim the
company's weight-loss program caused gallstones and led to surgical
removal of the organ, which produces and stores bile used in
digestion.
   The company, one of the nation's most heavily marketed diet
programs, said the suits are without merit. It claimed the risk of
gallbladder disease among the obese can be reduced by prudent
dieting.
   ``There's been many studies to show that overweight people have
a higher incidence of gallbladder problems,'' said Nutri-System
spokesman James Kemper Millard at the company's Willow Grove, Pa.,
headquarters. ``We just want the facts out. We don't want this to
be another `Martians have landed' story.''
   The company is privately held and does not release financial
reports.
   Millard said Nutri-Systems encourages about a two-pound-a-week
weight loss.
   The American Medical Association does not set a standard or
limit for weight reduction. The 60,000-member American Dietetic
Association recommends rapid weight-loss programs only for those
more than 30 percent overweight.
   ``The consensus is that there appears to be a link between rapid
weight loss and gallbladder problems, but it dosen't necessarily
have to be a diet by a company. It could be something the person
goes on themselves,'' said Dr. Georgia Andrianopoulos, an assistant
professor at the University of Illinois' Obesity Treatment Center.
   Nancy Wellman, president of the American Dietetic Association,
said some of the reported gallbladder problems could be from people
who cut back on established diets, such as Nutri-System.
   ``We are a country where most problems can be solved in a
half-hour TV show,'' said Wellman. ``Too many people opt for the
quick solution to lose weight without worrying about the
consequences.''

   The Deep South is wringing itself out
after a week of flooding turned entire towns into muddy lakes where
buildings poked up like knotty tree stumps, but the toll of
shattered lives is mounting.
   About 6,000 people lost their homes or had property damage in
Alabama, federal officials estimated Saturday. Hundreds more had to
seek shelter in Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, where swirling
floodwaters kept emergency crews on alert through the weekend.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez toured the flood-ravaged farming town
of Caryville on Saturday. He promised house-to-house damage
assessments, portable toilets, drinking water and food.
   Emergency management officials said flooding did more than $100
million in damage in Alabama, and high water there and in Georgia
was blamed for 15 deaths _ mostly people whose cars sank on
submerged roads.
   Searchers in south Alabama continued to look Saturday for Army
Spec. Mary Helen Garrison, 21, missing since March 18. Her car was
found submerged in a ditch Tuesday.
   The southeastern Alabama town of Elba, which lies along the
banks of the Pea River, was hit hardest by the flooding. The town
was submerged under about 12 feet of brown, trash-filled water when
its earthen levee collapsed early March 17 after 16 inches of rain
fell in two days.
   Nearly half of Elba's 4,400 residents had to be evacuated, and
most could not begin returning to homes and businesses for three
days. Legal records turned into soggy mush as water reached the
second floor of the Coffee County Courthouse.
   ``A lifetime of hard work for some disappeared into the raging
floodwaters,'' Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt said Saturday in his weekly
radio address. ``A lot of our people have never witnessed such
devastation from flood before.''
   Raging floodwaters also washed out dozens of roads and bridges
in southern Alabama.
   Volunteers in Geneva, located downstream from Elba, saved that
city's levee only by working feverishly in a human chain pitching
sandbags for two days.
   The flooding reached into western Alabama, where waters rose to
the ceiling inside Brewton City Hall. And in the central part of
the state, coffins bobbed to the surface from shallow graves when a
cemetery flooded in Selma, and about 160 animals had to be taken to
higher ground when the Montgomery Humane Society flooded.
   President Bush declared Elba and the rest of Coffee County a
disaster area Wednesday, making residents eligible for low-interest
loans and grants to cover uninsured losses. On Friday, 25 Alabama
counties were added to the declaration.
   ``You're talking about damage that would take years and years
and years to repair,'' said Robert Crowder, commission chairman in
Houston County.
   Country singer Hank Williams Jr. pledged receipts from an April
1 concert in Birmingham to the relief effort. Hunt said officials
in Charleston, S.C., which is still recovering six months after a
battering from Hurricane Hugo, also offered aid.
   While most of the water receded from Elba, Florida Panhandle
residents to the south were fording flood-covered streets, hoping
to find their homes intact.
   ``It just kind of stuns you a little bit,'' said Lamar Fortune
of Caryville, Fla. The lumber worker had to wade through 2 feet of
brown water late in the week to get home after the Choctawhatchee
River expanded out of its banks.
   In Georgia, where four died in flood-related traffic accidents,
Macon residents were urged to boil drinking water after the
Ocmulgee River surged into a sewage treatment plant. Raw sewage
poured directly into the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta and
Columbus because of flooded treatment facilities.
   But the flooding seemed especially cruel in Alabama, where
unending waves of severe weather have killed 35 people since
mid-November, including at least 11 in the past week. Twenty people
died when a tornado rampaged through Huntsville in north Alabama in
November, and five died in a Christmas cold snap that included
wind-chill factors of 40 degrees below zero.
   Violent weather is nothing new to the South, which has regular
brushes with tornadoes, hurricanes, crop-killing freezes and
flooding. But to have such a cluster of wicked weather is unusual,
said Paul Pettit, a National Weather Service meterologist in
Montgomery.
   ``And we're really not out of the flood season. March, April and
May are the prime time for severe weather'' in Alabama, said Pettit.

   Here is a look at Sunday's Hungarian election:
   AT STAKE:
   _ There are 386 seats in the parliament, or National Assembly,
elected for a four-year term. An additional eight seats will be
allotted to the eight main national minorities.
   ELIGIBLE VOTERS AND RULES:
   _ There are more than 7.8 million eligible voters, choosing from
among 29 parties. Only 12 parties are running nationally, and the
17 others are contesting only a few races. Twenty-one parties
fielded no candidates. A second round of voting is mandatory if no
party wins an absolute majority. Runoff elections are also possible
in individual races where there is no clear majority.
   _ All Hungarian citizens who have reached 18 years of age by
March 25 or are considered adults because they are married are
eligible to vote.
   ELECTION SUPERVISION:
   _ The Vienna-based International Helsinki Human Rights
Association has a delegation in Hungary monitoring the election
campaign and the election itself.
   _ The Council of Europe, based in Strassbourg, planned to send a
delegation to monitor the election.
   _ Former Vice President Walter Mondale led a 50-member
international delegation acting as observers for the election.
   MAIN PARTIES RUNNING:
   _ Twelve parties fielded candidates on a national scale. The six
frontrunners, acccording to a March 12 Gallup poll were: the
Hungarian Democratic Forum; the League of Free Democrats; the
Independent Smallholders' Party; the Hungarian Socialist Party; the
Social Democratic Party of Hungary, and the League of Young
Democrats.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum is a centrist party with 21,000
members, fielding 174 candidates. Chairman: Jozsef Antall, 58.
   The League of Free Democrats is a liberal party with 20,000
members, fielding 169 candidates. Chairman: Janos Kis, 46.
   The Independent Smallholders' Party is a rural party with 60,000
members, running 165 candidates. Chairman: Vince Voeroes, 79.
   The governing Hungarian Socialist Party is a West European-type
socialist party, established by reformists in the Communist Party.
It has 62,000 members and has 170 candidates. Chairman: Rezsoe
Nyers, 67.
   The Social Democratic Party of Hungary is a member of the
Socialist International, has 12,000 members and is fielding 74
candidates. Chairwoman: Anna Petrasovits, 36.
   The League of Young Democrats is a liberal youth party that sets
an age limit of 35 years for its more than 5,000 members. It is
fielding 80 candidates and is led by a steering committee.
   ISSUES:
   _ The primary issue is the economy, with a $20 billion foreign
debt, much of it accrued to finance the domestic debt. The
electorate and the parties are equally aware that any new
government has very little room to maneuver. With growing
unemployment, job security is an issue, but cutting state subsidies
and privatization can only mean a growing jobless rate.
   _ Other issues include the lot of the Hungarian national
minorities in neighboring countries and that of domestic minorities
_ Gypsies, for instance. Also, some complain that a full-scale
Soviet troop withdrawal is proceeding too slowly.

   Moslem militants killed five people who
opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India
and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday.
   At least 195 people, mostly Moslem demonstrators, have been
killed in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir since Jan. 20 when
the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
   State officials said four of the five people killed Friday and
Saturday were Moslems. They were identified as a deputy police
superintendent; the 73-year-old local leader of the Communist Party
of India; the grandson of another prominent Communist leader; and a
man accused of being a police informer.
   The fifth victim was a civilian, the sources added, speaking on
condition of anonymity. It was unclear if he was Hindu or Moslem.
   The former state legislator, Mir Mustafa, was pulled out of his
car at gunpoint Saturday near his home in Badgam, 12 miles west of
Srinagar, officials said.
   Srinagar has been a focal point of the fighting between
government troops and separatists.
   Family members and highly placed sources in the government of
Jammu-Kashmir said no group has claimed responsibility for the
abduction and no demands were issued.
   Mustafa was an independent member of the state legislature. The
governing body was dissolved in January when the federal crackdown
was ordered.
   In December, Mustafa helped negotiate a prisoner exchange in
which the kidnapped daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeed
was swapped for five prominent members of the radical Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front.
   The front is one of several Moslem militant groups waging a
campaign of bombings and assassinations to press demands for the
independence of Kashmir, a part of Jammu-Kashmir state.
Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-majority state in India.
   The secession movement has been simmering since 1947, when the
state of Kashmir was divided between India and Moslem Pakistan.
   The eastern part of the state is governed by India. The western
slice of Kashmir is under Pakistan's control.
   The two countries went to war twice over Kashmir, and their
armies still face each other along the disputed frontier.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo expanded New York's
``shield law'' on Saturday to protect the news media from having to
surrender to the courts most information collected by reporters and
television crews.
   ``Enactment of the bill is particularly appropriate this year as
we celebrate the bicentennial of the First Amendment,'' Cuomo said
in signing the legislation. ``Since 1735, when Peter Zenger was
acquitted of libel charges, New York has led the way in the
protection of freedom of the press.''
   Cuomo, a Democrat who is expected to seek election this year to
a third term, announced his action just before speaking at a
meeting of the New York State Society of Newspaper Editors.
   While New York's shield law, adopted in 1970, had protected
information gathered on a confidential basis from sources, recent
state court rulings had said there was no such protection for
information gathered without a promise of confidentiality.
   Under the expanded law, unpublished information or that supplied
without a pledge of confidentiality doesn't have to be given up by
news organizations in most circumstances. A court could still order
the information divulged if it determined the material was critical
to a case and not obtainable from any alternative source.
   ``The bill strikes an appropriate balance between the principle
of a free press embodied in the First Amendment and a defendant's
right to a fair trial,'' said Cuomo.
   The legislation was passed, 47-5, on Wednesday by the
Republican-controlled state Senate. In January, the
Democrat-controlled Assembly had approved it 119-11.
   The legislation gives New York one of the strictest protections
for journalists of any state in the nation, according to lawyers
for several news organizations.
   A similar bill failed to pass the state Senate by two votes in
the waning hours of the legislative session last year.
   As was the case in 1989, the opposition to the legislation this
year was led by state Sen. Emanuel Gold.
   ``I don't think there's a newspaper in the world that doesn't
preach in favor of good citizenship,'' said Gold, a New York City
Democrat. ``It seems in some situations, the newspapers can't be
bothered by the requirements of good citizenship.''
   Cuomo noted that approval of the legislation was pushed by the
New York Publishers Association, the New York State Broadcasters
Association, Capital Cities-ABC, CBS, NBC, The Associated Press and
the Gannett Co.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House panel studying the
health of the nation's $1.7 trillion pension system praised a Labor
Department proposal designed to crack down on fraud and abuse in
the system.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who is chairman of the House
Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee, called
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's plan ``prompt and inclusive.''
   In the past, members of Congress have criticized the way the
Labor Department policed the nation's pension system and suggested
that fraud and abuse could rival the savings and loan crisis.
   The Labor Department's proposal, outlined last week in a letter
to Lantos' panel, increases fines for fraudulent transactions and
makes it easier for employees to bring lawsuits against pension
fund trustees who mismanage assets. It also provides rewards for
people who inform the government of fund violations.
   Some of the changes stemmed from recommendations from acting
Labor Department Inspector General Raymond Maria, who has been
feuding with the agency over the way it investigates pension fraud.
   ``They went twice as far as we thought they would,'' Lisa
Phillips, an aide to Lantos' subcommittee, said Friday.
   Phillips predicted some lawmakers would try to go farther by
adding provisions to provide greater protection of pension payments
when companies terminate plans to capture their surplus assets.
   Labor Department spokeswoman Johanna Schneider said the agency
would have to review further changes before taking a position.
   Under the department's plan, employees who win suits against
trustees who mismanaged pension plans would have their legal fees
paid by the trustees personally rather than through pension assets.
   In addition, the plan lets Mrs. Dole pay a ``bounty'' to
informers of as much as 10 percent of any fines collected by the
government for pension violations. Penalties for illegal
transactions would increase to 10 percent of the amount of the
transaction. Fines are now 5 percent of the transaction.
   The agency's plan also implements new audit procedures that
require accountants to do a full audit of pension plans on their
own rather than relying on the statements of state examiners.
   Mrs. Dole already has asked Congress to add 100 enforcement
officers to the department's Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration.
   The Labor proposal does not include Maria's recommendation that
the inspector general's office be allowed to pursue criminal
investigations of pension and welfare fund violations. Maria wanted
Congress to in effect overturn a Justice Department ruling that
prohibited inspectors general from conducting criminal
investigations.
   Phillips said the House subcommittee was not likely to go
against the Labor Department on the issue because lawmakers
considered it a ``turf war'' between the Justice Department and
inspectors general.
   Maria had known he was not going to be named to the post
permanently; President Bush last week nominated Julian De La Rosa,
executive secretary of the St. Louis police board, as his
replacement.

   Serenaded by ``Auld Lang Syne,''
the last Indian soldiers withdrew from this northeastern port city
Saturday after a deadlocked 2{-year-old jungle war against Tamil
guerrillas.
   Sri Lanka's navy band played and its honor guard unsheathed
swords as the 2,000 Indian soldiers _ the last of an estimated
125,000 _ marched aboard the troop carrier Magar, which left for
Madras in southern India.
   The departure was a week ahead of the pullout deadline.
   ``You have made a great sacrifice, there is no doubt about
that,'' Sri Lankan Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told the
troops.
   At least 1,115 Indian troops died fighting the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil militant group fighting Sri
Lanka's Sinhalese-dominated government for an independent homeland.
   About 10,000 Sri Lankans have died in the insurgency, which
started in 1983.
   As the troop carrier chugged out into the bay, Tamil Tigers
patrolled Trincomalee's streets, along with Sri Lankan soldiers and
police.
   India, which also has a large Tamil minority, sent soldiers into
Sri Lanka in July 1987 to help enforce a treaty that granted the
Tamil minority limited autonomy in the northeast if they put down
their weapons.
   The Tigers refused to do so, and began battling the Indian
soldiers.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka reached an agreement
with the Tamil Tigers last summer and asked India to withdraw its
troops by July 27, 1989, the second anniversary of the peace accord.
   India stalled on the request, saying a rapid withdrawal could
lead to a bloodbath. But in his election campaign last fall,
India's new prime minister, V.P. Singh, promised to withdraw the
troops. A deadline of March 31 was set.
   The Sun, a leading Sri Lankan newspaper, said the withdrawal
signals the end of a ``chapter that is historic as much as
traumatic to this nation and its people. For most people in this
country, the ultimate withdrawal of the Indian troops is a joyous
scent.''
   Many Indian newspapers criticized the military operation,
accusing their government of fighting ``somebody else's dirty
war.'' Others called it a military disaster because India did not
succeed in disarming the Tamil separatists.
   The Tigers now control the area Indian soldiers once occupied. A
senior leader of the guerrilla organization, contacted by
telephone, said the Tigers had no immediate comment on the pullout.
The leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was reached in the
Tiger-held town of Jaffna.
   ``The soldiers' morale is high. We don't think we have lost a
war. We're just obeying orders,'' said an Indian commando on the
Trincomalee dock, pushing back his red beret to wipe sweat from his
forehead.
   In addition to the Indian-Tamil violence, the July 1987 accord
also sparked a backlash by ultranationalist Sinhalese, who felt the
Tamils had been given too many concessions. They began a violent
campaign that has left at least 6,000 people dead since 1987.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75
percent of the population. Tamils claim they suffer discrimination.
   India became involved in the conflict because of the sympathies
of its own politically powerful Tamil population. Most Indian
Tamils live in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, which is separated
from Sri Lanka by a stretch of sea 20 miles wide.

   Campaign rivalries were played out in
``poster wars'' before Sunday's parliamentary election. Some
observations on the last few days of the campaign and related
events:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Party militants vented their emotions in the ``poster war.''
Rivals competed in papering over each other's ads, and some wags
livened up placards they found too staid.
   One wit looking ahead to the day after the elections couldn't
resist a poster by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, a centrist party
with a strong following. To the placard boasting, ``Today, the MDF
Is Tomorrow,'' he added: ``But The Day After, You're Yesterday.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   One of the few controversies of the campaign centered around
another Forum poster that critics said awakened thoughts of
violence. The poster showed the back of the head of a bull-necked
Soviet officer with the Russian phrase, ``Comrades, It's All Over.''
   With a full-scale pullout of Red Army troops in progress and a
general diminishing of Soviet influence in Hungary's internal
affairs, Democratic Forum officials said the message was meant to
signal the end of an era. But numerous Hungarians _ including
Socialist Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers, a reformed Communist _ said
the phrase and imagery bring forth associations of lining an enemy
up against the wall and shooting him in the back of the head.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Most Communist images _ red stars, Lenin statues and hammers and
sickles _ have been removed from view across Hungary over the past
few months. But a plea to save at least some of the Communist
legacy came from an unexpected quarter.
   The League of Young Democrats, the first opposition party to
openly challenge Communist rule, wants a park created for all the
displaced Lenin statues. Given that the founder of Bolshevism is
almost always shown pointing ahead into the communist future, the
park would have scores of Lenin statutes, their fingers pointing
accusingly at each other.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For at least one public figure, Sunday's elections are even more
historic than is generally thought. Interim President Matyas
Szueroes considered them the first truly democratic vote in 1,100
years.
   ``In Hungary's 1,100-year history in Central Europe, these
elections will be unique in a sense,'' Szueroes said Saturday in
his election message. ``This will be our first true opportunity to
decide, vote and choose freely.''
   Szueroes apparently was alluding to contraints on voters even
during the period of parliamentary democracy that began in 1848 and
ended during World War II.

   Vice President Guillermo Ford of Panama said
Saturday his new government is moving quickly to stifle the
laundering of drug profits through Panama's banks.
   At a joint news conference with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Ford declared ``We're partners in a joint venture. We
are committed to this battle.''
   Ford, who last week lobbied Congress for a $500 million aid
package, declared that ``The United States is not imposing anything
on us. We are cooperating'' on the bank issue.
   Already, he noted, the new government has enacted a law which
imposes stiffer fines for failure to report major cash transactions
than those faced by U.S. banks. The penalties range from $100,000
to $1 million.
   Ford and Thornburgh met for about 30 minutes in the attorney
general's office. ``Good friends can discuss everything in 30
minutes,'' Ford said.
   Thornburgh said ``The most important thing we did was exchange
phone numbers. We're going to be working together on drug
trafficking and money laundering. And we pledged to make available
a number of key people to one another.''
   Ford said ``We're not telling the world that we are no longer
going to be a financial center. But we are going to be a decent,
honest financial center.''
   On Thursday, the House Banking Committee, moving with unusual
speed, approved 48-0 a bill that would authorize the Treasury
Department to revoke the charters of U.S. banks caught laundering
drug money. Bank officers could be banned from the profession for
life.
   The bill also reaches out to savings and loans, credit unions
and even state-chartered banks, whose federal insurance could be
revoked.
   The measure reflected congressional disappointment in the
Justice Department's recent settlement of a money laundering case
in Tampa, Fla., earlier this year.
   In that instance, two units of the Bank of Commerce and Credit
International pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy
involving, among others, Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega, now awaiting
trial in Miami on drug charges.
   BCCI agreed to forfeit $14 million in deposits and $1 million in
interest. While federal prosecutors hailed it as the largest
criminal penalty ever imposed against a bank, congressional critics
said it wasn't enough when measured against BCCI's assets of more
than $20 billion.
   The institution is based in Luxembourg and has offices in 73
countries.

<HEAD>Beaten Teen Tells Police Group Had Death Penalty For Dating
Outsiders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A band of Satanism-influenced
youths called the Legion of Doom mandated the death penalty for
members who dated outside the group and tried to carry out the
sentence on an 18-year-old member, police charged.
   Members of the legion skipped school, played at Satanism and
lived together as a family by their own rules, investigators said.
They established death as the penalty for violating the dating
rule, and the warrant was a piece of paper with a black dot on it.
   Troy Collins, 18, was handed his dotted paper in the woods west
of Palm Beach on March 16, just before he was beaten with tire
irons, chains and baseball bats, said Palm Beach County sheriff's
detectives.
   Collins was listed in stable condition Saturday at Wellington
Regional Hospital.
   In all, three juveniles and four adults were charged with
attempted first-degree murder and with criminal mischief, sheriff's
officials said. Another juvenile was charged as an accessory after
the fact, and another with carrying a concealed firearm.
   More arrests are likely, sheriff's Detective Paul Friedman said
Saturday.
   John Mears, 19, and Misty Perkins, 18, were released after
posting bail, booking clerks said. Francis Essley and David Turner,
both 21, remained in the county jail Saturday.
   After Collins regained consciousness Tuesday, he told deputies
about the group and how members baited him into the woods under the
guise of fighting a rival gang.
   Once there, he found he was to be punished for dating a
non-member, he said. Collins told detectives he heard one member
yell ``Kill him! Kill him!'' as he was being kicked and beaten.
   Collins said he escaped by losing his attackers in the woods.
   One of the juveniles confessed to participating in the attack,
but the others gave conflicting stories and reasons for the attack,
detectives said.
   There were ``15 to 20, if not more,'' legion members ranging in
age from 14 to 21, Friedman said.
   Detectives are investigating the role of one boy's father, who
allowed the group to stay with him and his son in a shabby concrete
house west of the city.
   ``He knew what was going on,'' Friedman said, without
elaborating.
   ``None of them lived at home. Most of them resided at the
house,'' he said. ``It's a very loosely formed group of kids. It's
got satanic overtones, but I would not say they're satanic
ritualists.''
   In searching the house Wednesday, deputies said, they found a
bloody chain, baseball bat with hair on it and blood-soaked clothes
and shoes. Satanic inscriptions and the words ``Legion of Doom''
were painted on walls inside the house.

<HEAD>Israel Fears End to Soviet Immigration as Exit Route Closes</HEAD>

   Officials said Saturday they feared thousands
of Jews could be left stranded in the Soviet Union after the
national Soviet airline decided to stop selling tickets to emigres
moving to Israel via Budapest.
   The decision by Aeroflot, the Soviet carrier, followed a move by
Hungary's Malev airline to suspend flights of Soviet Jews to Israel
due to threats of attacks by Arab radicals.
   ``We refuse to believe that the Soviet Union ... is subject to
giving in to any type of terrorism,'' said Gad Ben Ari, spokesman
for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency. The Agency is partially
responsible for the immigration and absorption of Jewish immigrants.
   ``We really can't understand the decision and are checking to
find out the meaning of it,'' he said. ``If true, then it is
definitely going to significantly damage the process of immigration
to Israel.''
   The majority of the thousands of Soviet Jews expected to
immigrate to Israel this month were scheduled to travel via
Budapest.
   Other smaller transit points are still open, but ``practically
speaking, the Jews are stuck,'' said Ben Ari.
   Israeli officials said charter flights could be found to replace
the Malev flights from Budapest to Israel, but this will not help
if the emigres are unable to reach Budapest to begin with.
   Hungarian officials said they cut the Malev flights after
threats from Arab extremists earlier this month. The pro-Iranian
Lebanese group, Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
threatened to attack any airline involved in the transport of
Soviet Jews to Israel.
   Soviet television said Friday that Aeroflot would not sell
tickets to emigrants traveling to Budapest from Moscow, Leningrad
or Kiev. The television said Aeroflot would still transport
businessmen and tourists.
   An Arabic newspaper reported Friday that Soviet and Israeli
officials have been visiting Cyprus and Greece to discuss setting
up a maritime line to bring Soviet Jews to Israel.
   The London-based Al Hayat newspaper quoted unnamed Greek and
Arab sources as saying the ships could sail between the Black Sea
port of Odessa and the Israeli port of Haifa.
   Officials in Cyprus and Greece could not be reached for comment
and under new censorship regulations, Israeli officials are barred
from commenting on routes taken by new immigrants.
   The Soviet Union has been under strong pressure from Arab states
to limit the number of Jews immigrating to Israel.
   Arab states fear that Soviet immigrants will be sent to live in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, strengthening Israel's hold
on the disputed territories. Israel says it has no policy of
directing Soviet Jews to the occupied lands, home to almost 1.7
million Palestinians.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat repeated his call to end Soviet
Jewish immigration to Israel in a statement Friday.
   ``For what reason do they come to my country instead of choosing
Canada, a country still underpopulated, or Australia, or Latin
America, or the Scandinavian countries, or the United States?''
Arafat said on Moroccan television.
   Israeli government statistics show that 16,700 Soviet Jews
immigrated to Israel from Jan. 1, 1989, to Feb. 1, 1990. Of those,
about 200 moved into the occupied territories. About 750,000 Soviet
Jewish immigrants are expected in Israel this decade, due to eased
exit policies in the Soviet Union and tighter U.S. entrance
requirements.

   A 5-year-old boy mauled by a pit bull
was recovering Saturday after surgery to repair painful bite
wounds, hospital officials said.
   Garry Chisholm's condition was upgraded from serious to fair
following the Friday night surgery, said Mark Morelli of Children's
Hospital of San Diego.
   ``This morning, the youngster is awake and well-oriented, but in
considerable discomfort,'' Morelli said Saturday. He said Garry
would remain hospitalized for several days.
   Authorities said the boy was mauled Friday after he jumped a
fence into a neighbor's back yard where the dog was kept. He was
bitten on the back and side of the head and suffered multiple
scrapes on his arms, back, chest and face.
   The pit bull's owner, Gabino De La Torre, found the shaken,
bleeding youth when he and a friend returned home from the beach.
   The dog was placed in quarantine by the San Diego County
Department of Animal Control. Agency officials said they will
decide by Tuesday whether it will be destroyed and are also
considering what legal action, if any, would be taken.

   Angry citizens surrounded Erich Honecker's
house and forced the disgraced Communist leader and his wife to
move out Saturday, a day after they had moved in, a government
spokesman said.
   The ailing 77-year-old Honecker and his wife, Margot, moved
Friday from their two-room apartment in a parish home outside East
Berlin to a better-equipped government residence about 50 miles
away.
   They returned to the church refuge after just one night, because
protesters gathered outside the new residence and created a
``dangerous situation,'' government spokesman Andreas Bauer said.
   West German television showed scores of irate residents
surrounding the official motorcade as it carried the couple away.
Some thumped on the roof of the Honeckers' car and made obscene
gestures.
   The Lutheran church has been sheltering the ousted leader since
Jan. 30.
   Nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations led to Honecker's
downfall Oct. 18 after 18 years of hard-line rule. He faces trial
on charges of high treason but is not jailed because he suffers
kidney cancer.
   A pastor's couple, Sigrid and Thomas Holmer, gave the Honeckers
shelter in their parish home after no one else wanted to take them.
Mrs. Holmer said the couple had received bomb threats since then.
   The army refused to let the Honeckers live at a military base,
saying it could not guarantee their safety.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art lovers saw empty spaces on the walls Saturday
as the Gardner Museum reopened two rooms hardest hit by last week's
multimillion-dollar art theft that has left curators worried about
protecting works to valuable even to be insured.
   The FBI has circulated composite sketches of the two thieves,
two international auction houses have posted a $1 million reward
for information leading to the return of the works, and the museum
has received tips on their whereabouts.
   The FBI has asked museum officials not to comment on the
investigation for fear of slowing it, a museum spokesman said. But
curators elsewhere are not optimistic. Sometimes, they say, art not
recovered soon after being stolen doesn't resurface for years.
   ``Police tell us the word is out on the street that you can get
money for art and antiquities,'' said Constance Lowenthal,
executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research
in New York. ``Museum trustees are thinking, `What if this happened
to us?'''
   Wearing police uniforms, two men talked their way into the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum early on March 18 and made off with
11 paintings and prints by such artists as Rembrandt, Degas and
Vermeer. They also swiped an ancient Chinese vase and a gilded
eagle from a flagpole.
   The locations where the stolen paintings were mounted will not
be filled because of restrictions in Mrs. Gardner's will about
changing artwork, said museum spokesman Barry Wanger. He said the
rooms have such a profusion of artwork, however, that the empty
spaces are not startling.
   ``People visiting the museum for the first time probably won't
notice so much,'' he said.
   Considered too well-known to be sold on to a legitimate
collector, the haul from Mrs. Gardner's collection has been
estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Investigators offer several theories on why the treasures were
stolen.
   A private collector with a penchant for the priceless might have
commissioned the theft, a sort of ``Dr. No'' scenario that curators
say is mostly the stuff of spy novels. The lesser-known works might
be sold on the black market and resurface in respectable galleries
in a few years.
   Or, most likely, the thieves might ransom the treasures either
for the reward or for insurance money, though Gardner officials
revealed this week that the works were not insured for theft.
   What is worrisome is that jumbo art heists seem to be increasing
in both scale and frequency as art prices soar on the legal market.
The loss in just a few recent thefts is staggering:
   _ Oct. 27, 1985: Five armed men steal nine impressionist
paintings by painters such as Monet, Renoir and Berthe Morisot from
the Marmottan Museum in Paris. One of the paintings, ``Impression:
Sunrise,'' is the work that gave impressionism its name. The take:
$12.5 million at 1985 prices.
   _ May 21, 1986: Thieves steal 18 paintings including Vermeer's
``Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid'' from Russborough House in
Blessington, Ireland. The take: $40 million.
   _ Feb. 8, 1988: Burglars break through a skylight into the
Colnaghi Art Gallery in New York City and steal 27 Old Master
paintings and drawings. The take: $6 million.
   Security consultants say museums are lagging in efforts to
prevent art theft. Guards hired to protect multimillion-dollar
paintings often are paid little more than minimum wage and given
scant training.
   In addition, only a handful of police or federal agents across
the country are trained to investigate art heists, and
international laws make it easy to transport works across national
borders.
   ``There's no duty on art,'' Lowenthal said. ``You couldn't just
bring $20 million in cash into the country, but you could bring in
a painting worth that much.''
   The biggest problem in the long run, Lowenthal said, is that as
more priceless works are stolen and art prices grow ever higher,
museums won't be able to replace the art they lose.
   ``Museums just can't afford to replace expensive works,''
Lowenthal said. ``You can always get another Warhol print. You
can't replace a Vermeer.''

Feared</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Advisers to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are
working on a package of drastic reforms to convert the stagnant
centrally controlled Soviet economy into a market system, an
informed source said Saturday.
   But they are concerned the measures could cause widespread
unemployment and force the government to institute a sweeping
welfare program in a country where until recently, unemployment did
not officially exist.
   ``The main problem is how to guarantee employment and take care
of the needy,'' said the source, who is part of the team developing
the new proposals. ``It all has to be worked out very carefully.''
   Despite the note of caution, the source gave no indication
Gorbachev has backed off his determination to press for radical
measures to wrest the already sick economy from its downward slide.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
transition to a market economy might lead to a sharp increase in
unemployment, which last year reached 27 percent in some areas of
the country. He indicated the reform could make it necessary to
initiate a widespread welfare system.
   The source provided the first independent confirmation of a
published report that a drastic, 17-point economic reform program
is being forged following Gorbachev's ascension to a new, stronger
presidency. The report was circulated last week by the Soviet
Interfax news agency, an affiliate of Radio Moscow.
   The package, designed by a team of economists, includes a reform
of prices now set by state planners without regard to costs. Among
other things, this has led to some farmers feeding their animals
bread, which is cheaper than grain. Any lifting of price controls
is expected to bring quick, dramatic inflation.
   The source said economists working on the plan were encouraged
by the example of Poland, which decided to adopt a market system as
quickly as possible to shorten the inevitably painful transition
period. Soviet leaders have preferred to be slower and more
cautious.
   Poland's Solidarity-led government last year lifted price
controls over a six-month period, which led to enormous price
increases. But there are signs the initial chaotic reaction is
abating.
   Inflation in Poland dropped from a monthly rate of 60 percent to
70 percent in January to a projected 6 percent in March. Once-empty
stores have been stocked, and the Polish zloty has been made
convertible thanks to a Western aid program.
   ``Look, in Poland it worked,'' the source said. ``There are
dangers, of course, and we have to be careful. But we don't have
any other choice.''
   One such danger is unemployment. In Poland, the number of
workers out of jobs jumped to 150,000 and might reach 400,000 as
inefficient enterprises are closed, Polish experts say.
   In the Soviet Union, efforts to streamline bloated factory
payrolls are leaving millions of people unemployed. Last October,
the Communist Party daily Pravda said joblessness, which officially
didn't exist during the doctrinaire Communist period, reached 27.6
percent in Azerbaijan. It was 20 percent or higher in the Central
Asian republics of Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan, Pravda said.
   According to Interfax, the package of proposed bills and
executive orders includes selling many government-owned factories
through stock sales to individuals and foreigners, and making the
ruble convertible on world currency exchanges.
   Immediately after his inauguration this month, Gorbachev pledged
drastic economic reform. Western diplomats speculated he needed the
security and powers of the five-year term as president to risk the
upheaval that might accompany the measures.
   Interfax quoted experts as saying the public is unprepared for
the changes contemplated.
   ``There can be no doubt that transition to a market economy is
our top priority,'' said V. Belkin, an Academy of Sciences
economist. ``What worries me ... is that it provides for an
overnight introduction of the market the way they did in Poland.
The model of that country may not work here, because public opinion
is not prepared to accept it.''
   Belkin warned that ``serious social problems'' could result.
   V. Mayevski of the academy's Institute of Economics also warned
of the social ramifications of the planned economic steps.
   ``A sharp increase in prices cannot be ruled out, as happened in
Poland, and there may be rampant unemployment, because the
structure of production in this country is inadequate,'' he said.
``In the long run, that scenario will lead to economic progress.
But before that considerable sacrifice will have to be made.''

   A farm tractor and wagon hauling 44
people to a funeral collided with a truck in western India on
Saturday, killing 23 people and injuring 26 others, Press Trust of
India said.
   The collision occurred near the village of Motipura, about 425
miles southwest of New Delhi in Gujarat state, the news agency said.
   The tractor and wagon were carrying 44 people to a relative's
funeral in another village, Press Trust said. It did not say how
many people were in the truck.
   Tractor-pulled wagons are often used to carry large groups of

<HEAD>Believers Say Virgin Mary Apparitions Foretold Fall of Communism</HEAD>

   An apparition of the Virgin Mary in Yugoslavia
that has drawn millions of believers foretold the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe, say participants at conference on
visions of the mother of Jesus.
   ``It just seems too coincidental to have her appear and then all
of a sudden the communist regime starts falling apart,'' said
Robert Lacher, 54, of Wexford.
   The two-day eastern regional conference on visions of the Virgin
Mary started Saturday at Duquesne University. The conference is
focusing on the increased number of reported messages and what
believers see as their tie to communism's collapse, sponsors said.
   The recent spate of visions of Mary and apparitions, defined as
the apparent touching and talking with the Virgin, started in 1981
in the Yugoslavian city of Medjugorje when a group of six
youngsters heard her message, said John O'Keefe of the Our Lady of
Peace Ministries in Pittsburgh.
   Since then, more than 16 million people have traveled to the
city, said the Rev. Kenneth J. Roberts of Florissant, Mo.
   Another apparition reported was by a 12-year-old girl and her
mother in Hrushiw, Ukraine, on April 26, 1987, one year to the hour
after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Ukraine, a Soviet
republic. Another reported message was to a housewife in Na Ju,
South Korea, sponsors said.
   The Roman Catholic Church is investigating all three
apparitions. The church has officially recognized previously
reported messages from the Virgin Mary, but they approved them only
after the visions had stopped, Roberts said.
   In fact, Catholic priets and nuns are the most skeptical of
these current apparitions, he said.
   Roberts claims he had a vision during March 1988 on one of his
many visits to Medjugorje. He first saw the pulsating sun, then a
``mighty wind'' blew him over from a kneeling position while he was
inside the church.
   ``I was changed from a doubter to a believer,'' Roberts said.
   Lacher said such visions may indeed take place, but the fact
that the Catholic Church hasn't yet recognized most of them keeps
him from being a true believer. He said he attended Saturday's
conference to learn more and perhaps erase some of his doubt.
   ``I think something is happening,'' Lacher added. ``What is
happening is good. It's bringing a lot of people to prayer.''
   The convention center in downtown Pittsburgh was filled with
those who journeyed from across the country and Canada. The center
was decorated with statues of the Virgin Mary, and soft, soothing
music was piped in over the speaker system before Mass and the
program.
   The more than 5,500 attending the conference had to stand in a
line stretching about a quarter of a mile in freezing temperatures.

<HEAD>Syrian, Egyptian Presidents Hold First Meeting, Call For Arab
Unity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In their first encounter since ending a 12-year rift
in December, the presidents of Egypt and Syria met in Libya on
Saturday and called for Arab unity, the Libyan news agency JANA
reported.
   The leaders joined Sudan's president and Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi in marking the 20th anniversary of the expulsion of
British forces from Libya, JANA reported.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad told reporters that without unity,
``I believe there will be no happy life'' for Arabs, said the news
agency report monitored in Rome.
   It quoted Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak as saying Arabs need
unity to withstand the challenges of the U.S. and European economic
blocs.
   The report did not say what the two discussed during their
meeting.
   Assad broke ties with Egypt in January 1977 after the Egyptian
president at the time, Anwar Sadat, made a dramatic visit to
Jerusalem. The visit was the opening move in two years of
negotiations that led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement. Most
other Arab countries cut ties with Egypt when it signed the treaty
with Israel in 1979, and the feud had been a major obstacle to Arab
cooperation.
   But links have been restored since a 1987 Arab summit decided to
let Egypt back into the Arab fold. Libya, long allied with Syria in
a hard-line radical front, has also been patching up its
differences with Egypt.
   JANA said Gadhafi welcomed Assad, Mubarak and Sudanese leader
Omar Hassan el-Bashir at the ceremony in Tobruk, on the
Mediterranean coast in eastern Libya. Gadhafi expressed a ``feeling
of happiness, delight and pride in our brothers,'' the report said.
   Gadhafi said Arab countries had to overcome differences of the
past and unite in the face of dangers threatening the Arab world.
   ``What I have been saying for 20 years is now a fact,'' he said.
``All Arabs now feel that unity has become a necessity. ... If we
quarreled yesterday, we make it up today. All differences are blown
away on the wind.''
   The 1970 British pullout from Tobruk's el-Adem air base took
place the year after Gadhafi overthrew the monarchy in a military
coup and established a republic.
   Gadhafi renamed the base after Egypt's late president, Gamal
Abdel Nasser.
   U.S. forces withdrew from Libya in June 1970.

   Former Vice President Walter Mondale
said Saturday he expects no cheating in Hungary's national
elections and had heard of no irregularities beyond what could be
expected in a U.S. campaign.
   ``I got up this morning and somebody said, `They've been tearing
down campaign signs,' '' said the Minnesota Democrat. ``I said,
`What are you talking about? That could be Minneapolis.'''
   Mondale was vice president under Jimmy Carter from 1980 to 1984
and the unsuccessful Democratic candidate in the 1984 presidential
election.
   He and Jan Carnogursky, the deputy premier of Czechoslovakia,
are among the 65-member international delegation in Hungary to
observe voting Sunday in Hungary's first free national election in
43 years.
   Carnogursky said his country, which in June holds its first free
election in more than four decades, could learn from the Hungarian
process.
   ``We expect nothing unusual to disturb the democratic process
Sunday,'' Carnogursky said.
   Mondale said a ``dark streak'' in pre-Communist Hungarian
politics _ anti-Semitism and ethnic intolerance _ showed up in some
campaigning.
   ``There has been some language used by some politicans that some
consider signals'' of religious and racial intolerance, Mondale
said.
   He refused to go into details, saying only that politicians of
leading parties ``admit it's around, but they do not think it's
going to be a basic determinant.''
   ``All the party leaders we talked to are clearly trying to avoid
that historic mistake that cursed not only Hungarian politics but
Eastern European politics for so long,'' said Mondale.
   Sponsors of the delegation's visit are the National Democratic
Institute and the National Republican Institute, organizations of
the U.S. political parties.
   Delegation members plan to tour polling stations and talk to
voters on Sunday as part of the monitoring process. The two
institutes have sponsored similar delegations to observe elections
in Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama, the Philippines and elsewhere, and
plan to send missions to other Soviet bloc countries planning
elections.
   Both U.S. parties sent delegations to Hungary during the
campaign to instruct the country's fledgling political parties in
the art of electioneering, unknown in Hungary since 1947.
   While the monthlong official campaign featured TV advertising,
debates, and posters plastered across towns and villages, it lacked
mailing lists and other super-sophisticated techniques of U.S.
presidential or congressional contests.

   President Bush's national security adviser,
Brent Scowcroft, on Saturday warned that any Soviet use of force or
intimidation in Lithuania ``would be counterproductive'' to
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Scowcroft said the Bush administration would take appropriate
measures in response to what it considered excessive Soviet
pressure or an increase in tensions in the Baltic republic.
   He did not elaborate but said military action was not a likely
option.
   ``We would not ignore it,'' however, he warned. ``They're under
no doubt about how we feel.''
   Bush, spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., was receiving periodic telephone reports from White
House aides as Soviet military vehicles rolled through the streets
of Vilnius a day after expelling two U.S. diplomats.
   ``We're watching it carefully,'' White House spokesman Bill
Harlow said.
   Scowcroft made his comments in a telephone interview when asked
to explain Bush's remark Friday that any Soviet ``attempt to coerce
or intimidate or forcibly intervene against the Lithuanian people
is bound to backfire. That is inevitable.''
   Scowcroft said such actions ``would be counterproductive for the
Soviets ... because it could affect the relationship _ our
relationship.''
   Scowcroft said Bush's comment could be read as ``a slight
escalation of the rhetoric as the Soviets have escalated their
action.''
   While the Soviets have indicated they ``consider it their
internal matter, none of our business,'' Scowcroft said, ``it has
to be our business because it could affect the relationship.''
between Washington and Moscow.
   In an interview Saturday on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday''
Lithuanian Consul General Ancietas Simutis said Lithuanians were
seeking moral support from the United States.
   ``We don't expect that the United States will go to war on
behalf of Lithuania,'' Simutis said. ``And we are against any
violence in or by Lithuanians or Russians or anybody. We believe in
democratic procedures.''
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the United States must make
clear to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev the consequences of its
actions in Lithuania.
   ``What the Bush administration owes Gorbachev and the American
people is candor,'' Lantos said on the CNN program. ``We must lay
out for Gorbachev now what the consequences would be of military
action. ... We have to tell Mr. Gorbachev that kicking out American
diplomats, kicking out the press of the Western world is not the
way to move towards peaceful negotiations. I very much hope that
Mr. Gorbachev's intelligence and statesmanship will prevail, and he
will turn back from this military intimidation that we have seen
during the last 24 hours.''
   One U.S. official said that while the administration was
concerned about developments, it appeared that it was ``not at all
a crisis situation'' on Saturday.
   Another official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it appeared the Soviets might not take any sudden action, but if
they did increase the pressure on secessionist Lithuania, they
would do so gradually.
   The official said it did not appear there would be ``some
cataclysmic thing like martial law.''
   Bush did not have any national security advisers with him for
the weekend, but top National Security Council officials were at
work at the White House.
   Harlow said he knew of no phone calls by Bush to Soviet or other
foreign leaders regarding the Lithuanian situation.
   The State Department on Friday protested the expulsion of two
U.S. diplomats, Douglas Wake and Jon Purnell, from Lithuania.
   The Lithuania matter was raised in a meeting between Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Soviet Ambassador Yuri
Dubinin in Washington on Friday, officials said.
   In addition, officials from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow were
``talking to their foreign ministry all the time,'' to underscore
U.S. concerns, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said
Saturday.
   ``We're still monitoring the situation. We're still concerned,''
she said.
   She said she could release no additional update on the status of
the two diplomats expelled from the Baltic Republican on Friday.
   But a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Moscow said Saturday they would
comply with the order to leave although he could not say whether
they had done so yet.
   Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the head of the official Soviet news
agency, Tass, said today he believes a state of emergency might be
declared in Lithuania, although it was unclear what that would mean.
   Tass has reported that Soviet embassies would review foreigners'
visa applications to travel to Lithuania, to keep out people
``inclined to engage in illegal activities.''
   In Washington, members of the Lithuanian-American community
pressed ahead, despite snowy weather, for an evening vigil to show
solidarity with the Lithuanians.
   They called on Bush to recognize Lithuania's independence, which
the president has declined to do even though the United States
never officially recognized the Soviet Union's forced annexation of
Lithuania in 1940.
   ``His statements on Friday were a little bit better,'' said
Jonas Alsenas of the Lithuanian-American group.
   Alsenas applauded Bush's statement that the United States
supports Lithuania's right to self-determination, but criticized
the U.S. stance on the new Lithuanian government.
   ``Even though they don't recognize the forcible incorporation of
Lithuania, they still won't recognize this democratically elected
government,'' Alsenas said.
   The weather hampered plans for the hastily called Saturday vigil
at the Lincoln Memorial, but organizers still looked for a few
hundred Lithuanian residents of the United States, saying some had
come from around the country.

   An American follower of the Hindu ``Path
of Bliss'' cult who was attacked by anti-cult villagers and then
held in solitary confinement nearly two months left for home
Saturday.
   Patricia Munday suffered a deep gash on her forehead Jan. 26
when she was attacked near the headquarters of the secretive Ananda
Marg sect in Purulia, a village in West Bengal.
   The local communist government of West Bengal has long accused
the Hindu cult of using black magic.
   The followers of Ananda Marg, which means ``path of bliss,''
deny they practice black magic but acknowledge using human skulls
in their meditation and ritual dances. The secretive group claims
4,500 followers around the world.
   ``In ordinary circumstances, I would have certainly stayed and
fought my case, but after seven weeks of virtual incarceration,
constant harassment and humiliation, I cannot bear these mental
tortures any longer,'' Ms. Munday was quoted as saying in a
statement issued by Ananda Marg.
   The statement said Ms. Munday continued to suffer from
headaches, insomnia, occasional amnesia and numbness in her arms
and legs after her detention by state police.
   Ms. Munday, who comes from Waitsfield, Vt., left New Delhi on
Saturday, said Ananda Marg member Susan Andrews. It was not known
when she would arrive back in Vermont.
   Ms. Munday, 39, was allowed to leave India after the country's
supreme court ruled that West Bengal police could no longer detain
her.
   The police had confined Ms. Munday to one room in a nursing home
and barred all visitors after she tried to lodge a complaint
against her attackers.
   Membership in the group is not a crime, and Ms. Munday was never
charged.
   Ms. Munday was a member of a United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees team that won the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize for helping
refugees in Somalia. She originally planned to stay in India and
challenge the West Bengal government's authority to detain her, her
lawyers and Ms. Andrews said.
   ``But it was just dragging on for six, seven weeks,'' said Ms.
Andrews, of Toronto. ``She was just going stir crazy. She just
said, `I can't hang out any longer.'''
   U.S. Embassy consular officers had been in contact with Ms.
Munday but did not accompany her to the airport, an embassy
spokesman said. Ms. Munday made her own travel plans.
   Ananda Marg has long aroused the suspicions of West Bengal
officials and rural villagers. It was founded in the early 1950s by
Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, an accountant who worked for the government
railroad system in Bihar, a state adjoining West Bengal.
   In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned and charged with aiding and
abetting the murders of six ex-followers of Ananda Marg. He was
convicted and spent seven years in prison before his conviction was
overturned.
   ``Ananda Marg is very much misunderstood,'' Ms. Andrews said.
``Some people are even saying that they kill people and use their
skulls.''
   She acknowledged, as witnesses have reported, that cult members
use human skulls in their meditation but said this was intended as
a way of showing that ``all of the attractions of the flesh are
pared down. We have to fix our minds on an internal truth.''
   Little information is available on the group's activities
because members are bound by an oath of secrecy. The group has said
it strives to create a social, economic and spiritual order that
will replace both capitalism and communism and rid society of
sectarianism and parochialism.

   A 6-year-old Palestinian was shot in the head
Saturday and critically wounded as his family was tilling land near
a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, an army spokesman
said.
   Tarek Mustapha el-Halabi was rushed to Mokassed hospital in Arab
east Jerusalem. He underwent surgery to remove a bullet that
entered his skull above the left eye, hospital officials said.
   El-Halabi's parents told Arab reporters and army investigators
they were working their land near the village of Rujeib, a mile
south of the West Bank city of Nablus, when two settlers shot their
son.
   The town is near the settlement of Itamar.
   The army could not confirm the report. A military spokesman said
no troops were in the area and that police were investigating the
incident.
   Arab reports said the settlers opened fire after Palestinian
youths stoned their car.
   Also Saturday, troops backed by helicopters raided the West Bank
village of Anabta and detained dozens of Palestinian activists, the
army said.

   The Cincinnati Zoo has introduced its twin
babies, the first successful polar bear births at the zoo in 40
years.
   The bears were born Dec. 13, but photographers were not allowed
to focus on the cubs until Friday.
   The cubs _ sex still undetermined _ weighed in this week at 18
and 15 pounds and their health appears excellent, zoo keepers said.
   The mother, Amy, and the father, Icee, were corporate-sponsored
gifts to the Cincinnati Zoo, where they arrived in 1984. The cubs
are the first that Amy and Icee have produced.
   Polar bear births in captivity are rare, Cincinnati Zoo
officials said.
   Icee will be transferred soon to the Columbus Zoo in a temporary
breeding loan.
   Polar bears are native to the Arctic. International conservation
programs protect the bears' migration and den areas and restrict
hunting of the animals.

<HEAD>Democrats Embrace Moynihan Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party on Saturday endorsed a
proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan to cut Social Security
payroll taxes as party leaders grope for ways to steal popularity
from President Bush.
   In a session marred by a controversy over supposedly racist and
anti-Semitic campaign tactics by Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., Democrats
also agreed on rules and schedules for the 1992 presidential
campaign season.
   A resolution at the spring meeting of the Democratic National
Committee urged Congress to support the proposal forwarded several
weeks ago by Moynihan, D-N.Y. The resolution is non-binding, and
Democratic leaders in Congress have opposed such a cut as
irresponsible when Congress is trying to cut the deficit.
   Adopting a more aggressive pose toward the Republican
administration, Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown dubbed
the GOP the party of ``debt and taxes.'' For years, the Democrats
have labored uncomfortably under Republican attacks calling them
the ``tax and spend'' party.
   Brown expressed relief over ``getting the rules process behind
us'' with what he called ``the most peaceful accord'' in the past
20 years.
   But the chairman's pleasure at getting the rules debate out of
the way and getting the party on record in support of the Moynihan
proposal, was tempered by the controversy involving Savage. Savage
was accused of verbally attacking whites and Jews during his recent
primary campaign.
   ``We abhor and oppose racism and anti-Semitism in any form,''
Brown told a news conference.
   ``I don't care to get into attacking Gus Savage as an individual
although he's chosen to attack me on a couple of occasions,'' said
Brown. Savage recently referred to the party chairman, who also is
black, as ``Ron Beige.''
   Brown later issued a new, stronger statement saying that
``racism and anti-Semitism is disgusting in any context. ... I
intend to contact Congressman Savage and let him know in no
uncertain terms that the chairman of the party and the party itself
abhors and condemns his remarks.''
   While the party officials were meeting in Indianapolis,
Democratic elected officials were getting together in New Orleans
for a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council.
   At the party meeting in New Orleans, a succession of speakers
mncluding Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., and Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Gov. L.
Douglas Wilder of Virginia and House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt outlined their view of the party's agenda for the decade.
   Jesse L. Jackson gave a speech at the gathering in which he
adhered to the new mainstream tone of the party.
   ``The Democrats must find common ground as the party of those
who live on their paychecks,'' said Jackson, who has twice sought
the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Jackson said Democrats are increasingly united on such issues as
choice in abortion, fighting crime and drugs and government aid to
those in need.
   ``We're talking about mainstream values and that's a wider
stream than many thought,'' Jackson said.
   In additional to the payroll tax cut, which the Democrats were
portraying as a boon to the middle class, the party was also
pushing education and the environment as issues that can be used
against Bush.
   The new party rules adopted in Indianapolis had few major
changes from those that governed the campaign for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination.
   Most significant were provisions requiring states to use
proportional representation to allocate delegates chosen in
caucuses or primaries. The party also could strip of a state of up
to 25 percent of its delegation for failure to comply with rules.
   The proportional representation rule bars states from holding
primaries in which national convention delegates are elected
directly rather than allocated among the presidential candidates on
the basis of the percentage of the vote their receive in individual
congressional districts.
   The new rules also allow states to hold primaries or caucuses
starting the first Tuesday in March. In 1988, the starting date was
the second Tuesday in March.
   The traditional exemptions were preserved for Iowa, New
Hampshire, and Maine.
   The party also solidified the rule requiring that a candidate
receive at least 15 percent of the popular vote in order to qualify
for delegates. States were barred from raising that percentage.

<HEAD>Jet Crew Saw Small Plane 3 Seconds Before Runway Crash, Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crew of an Eastern Airlines 727 that
struck a twin-engine plane on an Atlanta runway in January saw the
other craft just three seconds before the collision, federal
documents show.
   The jetliner's pilots also said the smaller aircraft had no
lights on at the time of accident, which occurred at about 7 p.m.
   The pilot of the Beechcraft BE-A100 was killed and the co-pilot
injured on Jan. 18 when the plane was struck by the jetliner's
right wing on a runway at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport.
No one aboard the 727 was injured.
   The Federal Aviation Administration decertified but has since
recertified the controller in the tower who lost track of the
Beechcraft after it landed.
   The safety board this week released the transcript of a cockpit
voice recording in which the tower spoke with pilots of the
Beechcraft, the Eastern plane and a Continental flight that landed
just ahead of the small plane.
   In the transcript, the first sign of trouble appears to be
registered by the first officer of the Eastern flight, who says
``Oh,'' followed by an ``expletive'' and then ``Oooooh.''
   Three seconds later the recording registers the ``sound of
impact.''
   ``God bless,'' the first officer says.
   Two minutes further into the transcript the pilot is quoted as
saying the smaller plane ``had no lights.''
   ``He had no lights,'' said the first officer.
   ``I didn't see him till he was right there,'' said the pilot.
   ``He was, yeah ... there were no lights,'' said the first
officer.
   Eastern Flight 111 was arriving in Atlanta from Montreal with an
intermediate stop in New York. The EPPS Air Service Beechcraft was
on a short flight from nearby Peachtree Airport.
   FAA spokesman Roger Meyers, reached in Atlanta, noted that the
agency had said in January that the runway should have been clear
before the Eastern plane was given permission to land.
   A report from the safety board said radar showed the distance
between the Eastern jetliner and the Beechcraft was 1.2 miles at
the time that the smaller plane crossed the threshhold of the
runway. FAA regulations call for a distance of 2.5 miles until the
tower begins to guide the planes visually.
   At that point, separation is up to the air controller's
judgment, he said. He said the agency is satisfied that regulations
concerning the separation of the planes were followed.

   An intercollegiate talent competition
sponsored by a University of Southern Mississippi fraternity and
sorority erupted into fights, sending four people to a hospital and
one to jail, school officials said.
   At least four fights were reported on campus following the
``Step'' competition at Bennett Auditorium.
   Omega Psi Phi fraternity and Delta Sigma Theta sorority, both
black organizations, sponsored the annual talent competition Friday
night that drew a crowd of 700 to 800 people.
   ``It got out of hand,'' said USM public relations director Bud
Kirkpatrick. ``The incident that precipitated everything inside the
Step program was that a person stood up and proceeded to hit a
judge.''
   The fighting also apparently involved a rivalry between two
organizations from another college, Kirkpatrick said. He said he
did not know the names of the groups or which colleges they
represent.
   ``There were five or six other schools competing with our
students,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``It was between two groups from the
same institution. Apparently there is an intense rivalry between
the two groups. One had just finished performing when the other
made some remarks.''
   A dance scheduled for the Sports Arena after the talent show was
canceled shortly before a scuffle erupted there, said Deputy Billy
Magee. Fights also were reported at residence halls.
   Three men were taken to Forrest General Hospital for treatment
of lacerations and other minor injuries, and a fourth was admitted
for treatment of cuts, a possible ruptured eardrum and possible
concussion.
   ``As best as we can determine they are not USM students,'' USM
President Aubrey K. Lucas said. ``We do not know if they are
students elsewhere.''
   Authorities said one person was arrested after he was found with
a car tire tool in his pants. He was charged with a misdemeanor
count of carrying a concealed weapon.

incinerator.
   James Burnett and a friend had been smoking marijuana and
sipping cough syrup in their truck parked near the landfill
Thursday afternoon when Burnett walked over to the incinerator and
climbed in, witnesses said.
   ``It wasn't a matter of tripping,'' said Manatee County

   Sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow said Burnett, 30, a gardener
who often hauled trees and brush to the incinerator, ``made remarks

   Burnett's friend Greg Mayers told investigators Burnett was

<HEAD>Communist Party Expells Two Former Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party expelled two
former Cabinet ministers Saturday as part of a major restructuring
under way since the revolution that ended the Communists' monopoly
on power.
   State television announced that the once all-powerful Central
Committee decided to expell former Foreign Minister Bohuslav
Chnoupek and former Interior Minister Vratislav Vajnar.
   Several other Communists who once led the country have also been
ousted from the party, including former President Gustav Husak and
former general secretary Milos Jakes.
   Husak, Jakes and their associates were responsible for 21-years
of hard-line policies following the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion
that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968.
   They lost power in a peaceful revolution late last year that
propelled a coalition government dominated by non-Communists to
power and installed former dissident Vaclav Havel as president.
   Communists, including current premier Marian Calfa, have been
deserting the former ruling party en masse ever since. The
television report said the party, estimated to have some 1.7
million members before the revolution, currently has 1 million
members.
   In Prague, some 70 percent of one-time Communists have turned in
their party cards, the television said.
   The report also said the Communists agreed to give up their huge
Central Committee headquarters in Prague, and other buildings in
the capital, including the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, a large
Communist party hotel and a historic center for the Social
Democrats.

<TEXT>
   Former secret police agents have denounced
the leader of East Germany's Social Democratic Party, but he denied
their charges that he was a regular police collaborator, a West
Germany news magazine said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said a united
Germany should put the past behind and live in peace with Poland,
its eastern neighbor.
   The allegations about Social Democratic chairman Ibrahim Boehme
mirrored similar allegations against Lothar de Maiziere, leader of
East Germany's Christian Democratic Union, Der Spiegel reported.
   De Maiziere, who is slated to become East Germany's first
non-Communist premier, also has denied the allegations. Der Spiegel
said it had no proof of secret police links of either politician,
only claims by former agents.
   Two former agents alleged that Boehme used three code names
while acting as an informer for the Stasi, the once-feared East
German secret police that ruthlessly suppressed any dissent, the
magazine said.
   Boehme's Social Democrats finished second to the CDU in the
March 18 elections, the first free balloting in East German history.
   East Germans have been obsessed with the Stasi since their
popular revolution overthrew hard-line Communist leaders. They
stormed its East Berlin headquarters in January and forced the
government to dismantle the agency.
   East Germany's week-old democracy has been hounded by reports
that many members of the new 400-seat parliament might have had
links with the secret police. The leader of one party, Democratic
Awakening, resigned just three days before this month's elections
after admitting he had collaborated with the Stasi.
   In Mainz, West Germany, on Saturday, Kohl addressed the Polish
boundary issue by saying that ``the idea now is to draw the line''
on the past and provide ``clear assurances on the borders'' of
postwar Europe.
   ``I want Germany to live in peace and, if possible, in
friendship with its Polish neighbors,'' the West German chancellor
told a meeting of his Christian Democratic Union party.
   Poland worries that a united Germany could try to reclaim areas
awarded to Poland after the collapse of Nazi Germany. The territory
comprises one-third of present-day Poland, which has sought a peace
treaty with both German states before unification.
   Millions of Germans were expelled from Poland after World War
II, and they form a conservative force in West German politics.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she believes Kohl
personally remains opposed to signing a formal treaty guaranteeing
Poland's western border, Der Spiegel reported.
   ``I have heard Helmut say: `No, I won't guarantee anything, I
don't recognize the current borders,''' Der Spiegel quoted Mrs.
Thatcher as saying in its latest issue.
   At the same time, she said she accepts that a united Germany
will become the most powerful country in Europe.
   ``We just have to get used to the idea that there will be a
country in Europe in the future that will be more powerful than all
the others,'' she said in the interview, which Der Spiegel provided
in advance to other news media before publication Monday.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been wary of hasty moves toward unification by
West Germany, already the strongest member of the European Economic
Community.

   A storm blew snow over the mid Atlantic states Saturday after
dumping up to 9 inches of snow on parts of Missouri, and a cold
front returned temperatures to winter levels across much of the
nation.
   Seven traffic deaths were blamed on icy, snow-covered roads in
the south-central part of the country.
   A week and a half ago the middle Atlantic Coast states had
record high temperatures in the 80s which brought cherry blossoms
and other flowers out early. On Saturday, a light coat of snow
covered some of those blossoms and buds.
   Winter storm warnings were posted Saturday for parts of
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, where 4 to 8 inches of snow
was possible.
   Atlantic City, N.J., had 1.5 inches of snow by early afternoon.
About 2 inches fell during the morning in southwestern Pennsylvania.
   In the south-central states, light snow, sleet and freezing
drizzle continued Saturday in the wake of the storm.
   Missouri got up to 9 inches of snow Friday, the biggest March
snowfall at Kansas City in 12 years. Three traffic deaths were
blamed on the weather.
   ``Weather in Missouri always presents a challenge,'' said Vince
Acquaviva of the National Weather Service in St. Louis. ``I would
say March in Missouri is impossible. March can be a cocktail, with
a little bit of everything _ snowstorms, thunderstorms, tornadoes.''
   On March 24, 1912, residents of Kansas City began to dig out
from 25 inches of snow that fell in 24 hours, nearly twice that of
any other storm on record there. Olathe, Kan., got 37 inches of
snow, a single storm record for Kansas.
   Parts of Kansas got 7 inches of snow and reported three
weather-related traffic deaths.
   ``Most roads are packed and very hazardous throughout the
state,'' said a spokesman for the Kansas Highway Patrol.
   Oklahoma got a mixture of snow and sleet Friday, with thunder
and lightning, and had one traffic death.
   The storm later produced heavy snow in the Ohio Valley, with 8
inches at Linton in southern Indiana and 5 inches in southern Ohio
at Cincinnati and Hillsboro by sunrise Saturday.
   Elsewhere Saturday, light snow lingered over parts of eastern
Colorado, western Nebraska and western Kansas.
   Temperatures were generally only in the 20s Saturday afternoon
from the western Plains to the upper Great Lakes, and in the
Northeast, with readings in the teens in Wyoming and Montana.
   The cold front produced a sharp temperature contrast across
Texas. Temperatures at midday ranged from 23 at Amarillo to 81 at
McAllen. Waco was at 42 while College Station, just 75 miles to the
southeast of Waco, had a reading of 72.
   Morning lows were below the freezing mark from the Rockies to
New England, and in the teens and single digits and lower from
Montana and Wyoming to Michigan.
   Billings, Mont., had a record low of 5 above zero.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 15 below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

<TEXT>
   The poor, the humble and the
devout flocked by the thousands Saturday to honor the memory of
Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar A. Romero on the 10th anniversary
of his assassination.
   More than 1,000 people jammed the unfinished downtown cathedral
in San Salvador, and several thousand more listened to the Mass
piped through loudspeakers to the plaza and streets outside.
   A 20-block march commemorating Romero preceded the religious
service. It was led by 16 bishops, including Roger Mahoney of Los
Angeles; Leo Mattieson, of Amarillo, Texas; and Nicolas D'Antonio
of New Orleans, La.
   Romero was slain March 24, 1980, as he said Mass at a hospital
chapel. Although the Christian Democratic government of 1984-89
compiled evidence implicating extreme rightists, no one has been
arrested or charged in the murder.
   No high-ranking official from President Alfredo Cristiani's
conservative administration or his Republican Nationalist Alliance
were present. The late former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a
Christian Democrat, accused Arena founder Roberto d'Aubuisson of
having ordered Romero's assassination.
   Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of state, sent
a message that said Pope John Paul II ``joins the service in spirit
and raises a prayer that the sacrifice of that pastor become a new
call to reconciliation and forgiveness.'' The message was read at
the Mass.
   El Salvador's decade-old civil war, which began engulfing this
nation about the time Romero was killed, continues unabated. The
death toll surpassed 72,000 late last year when leftist rebels
launched a monthlong offensive.
   The Metropolitan Cathedral, which has been under construction
for 30 years and has been closed for worship since October, was
reopened for the commemoration.
   The facade was festooned with huge banners quoting scripture.
One, citing John 10.15, read: ``I give my life for my flock.''
   The service is to be the last public religious homage to Romero
in decades, because he will be formally proposed for beatification,
the first step toward sainthood, in coming weeks. Church doctrine
prohibits public homage to candidates for sainthood.
   Local church officials and many in the Vatican say prospects are
good for Romero's eventual sainthood, but they say the process will
take up to 30 years. Archbishop Thomas Becket of Canterbury was
murdered at the altar in 1170 and later canonized.
   On Saturday, marchers carrying white flags, palm fronds studded
with paper flowers and portraits of Romero chanted: ``Saint, pastor
and prophet; Monsignor Romero lives in the hearts of the people.''
   Most marchers were peasants in sandals with worn or mended
clothing, but many city dwellers also joined the procession and
attended the Mass.
   Some marchers carried portraits of six Jesuit priests allegedly
murdered by army troops on Nov. 16.
   Romero and the slain Jesuits exercised what in modern theology
has come to be called ``the preferential option for the poor.''
They lived humbly and condemned exploitation, inequality and
oppression.
   Many rightists called them subversives.
   Catalina Rivera, a 62-year-old peasant woman who had traveled
four hours by bus from La Libertad province to listen to the Mass,
said: ``Monsignor Romero helped us all by announcing the truth.
That is why they killed him. Because the truth hurts those who
don't want to hear it.''
   El Salvador suffered from a terrible wave of repression in 1980
and later years, when rightist death squads and government troops
kidnapped, tortured and executed hundreds of suspected leftists
every month.
   In his last homily the day before he was killed, Romero issued
an impassioned appeal to soldiers to disobey orders to torture and
murder.
   ``In the name of God, in the name of this suffering people whose
cries rise to heaven more loudly each day, I implore you, I beg
you, I order you in the name of God: Stop the repression,'' he said.
   ``For being the voice of those without voice, he was violently
silenced,'' said San Salvador Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas,
Romero's successor, in Saturday's homily.

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has upgraded
its investigation into a power outage that shut down one reactor
last week at Georgia Power Co.'s nuclear Plant Vogtle.
   NRC spokesman Ken Clark said the decision to upgrade the
investigation from an ``augmented inspection'' to an ``incident
investigation,'' made Friday night in Washington, was made because
of safety and regulatory concerns.
   A site emergency was declared at the Waynesboro plant Tuesday
when a truck backed into a utility pole, knocking out electricity.
Only one of the plant's two nuclear reactors, Unit 2, was in
operation and automatically shut down.
   No one was evacuated and no radioactive materials escaped, but
the reactor has yet to be restarted.
   ``This came up because the NRC management believes it is
necessary because of the safety significance and potential
regulatory questions raised'' by the emergency, Clark said of the
decision.
   Among other things, the investigation is to determine why it
took utility officials an hour to notify emergency authorities of
the problem. The plant is supposed to notify the surrounding
counties and state officials of any incidents within 15 minutes.
   But Burke County was not notified for 45 minutes and the state
for an hour, said Georgia Emergency Management Agency spokesman
Harry Heath.
   Georgia Power spokesman John Thrasher said ``we plan to
cooperate fully,'' but refused further comment.
   The company agreed not to restart Unit 1 until the investigation
is complete.
   The plant's other reactor, Unit 2, was shut down for refueling
at the time of the outage. Its cooling system was without power for
36 minutes because a back-up diesel generator didn't start
immediately. The generator was started manually.

   The splintered rebel movement in Afghanistan
has produced its share of factions in Congress over how to allocate
U.S. dollars for groups fighting the Soviet-backed government.
   As Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, jokingly put it, the only way
to get everyone back under the same tent is to ``bring the Red Army
back.''
   At issue is not only how the CIA spends $600 million a year in
taxpayer money on covert operations against the government headed
by Najibullah, but also whether to continue that level of aid.
   The United States began supplying weapons to Afghan rebels after
the Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in late 1979.
Although Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan last year,
Najibullah remains in power.
   The dispute has focused in particular on the amount of aid being
received by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the leader of one of seven rebel
factions. In addition to complaints that the aid is being
distributed unfairly is one that Hekmatyar is a Soviet agent.
   The question of where Hekmatyar's allegiances lie was raised by
reports written by a group of staffers working out of the office of
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
   Evidence suggests Hekmatyar ``and his key commanders work for
the USSR to a certain degree,'' according to a report prepared by
the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare.
   Hekmatyar ``is definitely devoted to fighting the U.S.'' and has
cooperated with Iran and other radical Muslims to that end,'' the
paper said. The task force is part of the House Republican Research
Committee, of which McCollum is a member.
   The report said Hekmatyar was a member of the communist party in
his youth and has maintained close contacts with the Soviets.
   Hekmatyar recently joined with Afghan Defense Minister Shahnawaz
Tanai who waged an unsuccessful coup attempt March 6 against
Najibullah, whose regime receives an estimated $300 million in
weapons a month from the Soviet Union.
   Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., also says there is a ``growing
discontent in Congress'' with the CIA's reliance on Pakistan's
Inter-Services Intelligence to deliver aid. Ritter complained that
the Pakistanis have unfairly favored Hekmatyar's over the other
rebel groups.
   Wilson, a staunch supporter of the rebels, said he is unprepared
to defend Hekmatyar but considers it ``absolutely false'' to
suggest he is a KGB plant.
   ``I'm absolutely 100 percent satisfied with the job the CIA is
doing,'' said Wilson, a member of the House Intelligence Committee.
   Robert Peck, the State Department's former top analyst on
Afghanistan, said Hekmatyar may be a problem but there was no
evidence of his being a Soviet agent.
   Donald J. Morrissey, the Republican task force's legislative
director, said the papers did not necessarily represent the views
of the task force members, but were intended to encourage debate.
   Indeed, they have in a period when U.S. policy is in flux.
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., a task force member with expertise in
the intelligence field, said he viewed the report as a
``speculative document'' that ``wasn't quite as persuasive'' as the
authors probably intended.
   But Goss said the paper underscored the feeling on Capitol Hill
that lawmakers ``are trying to come to grips'' with what to do
about Afghanistan.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of a House subcommittee on
Asia, has suggested conducting the debate in public rather than in
private. Ritter may call for a cutoff in aid until he is assured
Pakistan is giving money to the right people.
   Wilson, who has visited Afghanistan and is considered one of the
most knowledgeable lawmakers on the issue, advocated ``keep doing
what we are doing.''
   ``There is a lot of impatience in Congress,'' he said, adding it
is ``going to be difficult'' to keep aid levels at their current
amount.
   But ultimately, Wilson said the U.S.-backed rebels should
prevail and gain control of their country, he said.

   Lee Atwater planned to spend a second night in

Saturday, one of the five he must take weekly to shrink the
non-malignant tumor on the right side of his brain.
   The tumor was discovered earlier this month. Atwater, 39, was
rushed to the same hospital March 5 after collapsing during a
speech.
   Atwater was hospitalized for several days but returned to work a
week after the seizure.
   Atwater was named to head the RNC after managing George Bush's
successful presidential campaign. He managed South Carolina Sen.

<HEAD>Head of Lithuanian Legaton in Washington Designated Chief Diplomat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stasys Lozoraitis Jr. is fluent in half a
dozen languages. Russian is not one of them, though he confesses a
desperate need to know it. Still, ``it is a question of
principle,'' he says.
   Lozoraitis is the man in charge of the musty, 40-room mansion on
16th Street, a mile from the Soviet embassy, which serves as the
legation of free Lithuania, as it has for nearly 70 years. But for
the last 50 of those years, Lithuania was not free.
   Two Sundays ago, the building was filled as the Lithuanian
legislature pondered a declaration of independence from the Soviet
Union, whose troops overran the nation in 1940. ``I think all the
500 Washington Lithuanians came,'' said Lozoraitis. ``Little
children holding balloons, men and women bringing whiskey bottles,
cookies, or just smiles. Poles _ though not yet those from their
embassy down the block _ Estonians, Latvians, Armenians,
Americans.''
   And then the news arrived _ sent via a fax machine that
Lithuania's new president, Vytautus Landsbergis, had smuggled home
after visiting Lozoraitis, a old school chum, in Washington last
summer.
   ``The vote was for freedom!'' cried Lozoraitis. With that, the
celebration began.
   Another message arrived Saturday. The legislature had formally
declared that its power would fall, symbolically, to the Washington
legation and Lozoraitis if the Soviets crush the new government.
   A similar role was occupied for 45 years by Lozoraitis' father,
until his death, at age 88, five years ago. Just days before the
Soviet troops arrived in 1940, free Lithuania's last foreign
minister had sent this message to his embassies: ``If catastrophe
strikes, please consider Stasys Lozoraitis chief of our nation's
diplomatic corps.''
   The elder Lozaraitis, using gold reserves transferred from
Lithuania to Sweden as the Soviets moved in, ran not only the
Washington legation and four U.S. consulates, but diplomatic
outposts-in-exile in the Vatican, Great Britain, Canada and
Venezuela. According to his son, it has been the only diplomatic
service in history to hold to its mission for more than a half
century after its country was conquered.
   ``For 50 years,'' said Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., ``we have carried
on, Working, living, dying. It is such a pity my father isn't here
to see all our efforts come to such a conclusion.''
   Throughout the legation are symbols of hope. Above the fireplace
in the great hall hangs a painting of a white knight, the national
symbol. A mural of the 600-year-old nations 1918 Declaration of
Independence adorns the front hall. On a white-skirted table in the
grand salon, an old photograph depicts Lozoraits's bearded
grandfather _ a politician and philosopher _ with the grandfather
of Landsbergis.
   Lozoraitis, who declines to give his age, had just entered his
teens when his father, a former foreign minister, was sent off to
Italy ahead of the invading Soviet tanks.
   In Italy, the son helped his father with diplomatic reports _ he
says he was 15 when he decoded his first cipher _ but resisted
diplomacy as a career. He wanted to fight. And he did, as a member
of an underground group which rescued Jews and American prisoners
of war.
   ``As far as my family was concerned, I was absolutely
irresponsible,'' he recently told The Washington Post. ``We would
put these people in cars and drive them to Catholic monasteries or
convents or the Vatican. I was arrested once by the Germans, but
through friends my father saved me.''
   His exploits during the war also took him back into the Baltic
states, and he acknowledges that he has since visited Lithuania
more than once _ though not officially. ``I would not go to the
Soviet Embassy to ask for a visa to my own country,'' he said.
   Before taking over for his father in Washington, the son was a
journalist for Vision, an international economics magazine, and
learned several languages along the way. But not Russian. ``It is a
question of principle. And I am sorry, because I need it very
much,'' he said.
   In a recent interview with the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour,
Lozoraitis expressed the belief that Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev will hold true to his pledge not to use force against the
new Lithuanian government.
   ``We are not threatening the political position of Gorbachev,''
he said. ``If he lets us go, his stature as a political figure will
only increase, and he will remain in history.''
   But Saturday, the Soviet Foreign Ministry ordered foreign
diplomats out of Lithuania, and a military convoy rumbled through
the Vilnius, the capital. And Lozoraitis was left to pray that he
will not have to take the symbolic torch of power a nervous
legislature was prepared to bestow upon him.
   The State Department, for years, has tiptoed around the
legation's status. The United States has never recognized the
forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the
Soviet Union, and throughout the Cold War has called upon Moscow to
release its ``captive nations.'' On the other hand, it has not
accredited the diplomatic corps-in-exile headed by Lozoriatis, nor
has it recognized the new government.

Merit Award</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher Saturday signed an agreement that abolishes
the visa requirement between his country and Hungary.
   He also presented a merit award to Foreign Minister Gyula Horn,
apparently for Hungary's decision to open its borders last year to
East Germans seeking a better life in the West. The exodus of East
Germans sparked the peaceful revolution that led to East Germany's
first free elections last weekend.
   Hungarians were to go to the polls Sunday for their first free,
multiparty elections in 43 years of Communist rule.
   Visa-free travel between West Germany, a member of NATO, and
Hungary, a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, goes into effect
May 1.
   Genscher and Horn also signed three other bilateral agreements
on education and management training for Hungarians.
   ``It remains unforgotten that Hungary was the first to cut the
Iron Curtain,'' Genscher told Horn after the signing ceremony.
   Hungary began dismantling the barbed wire barriers along its
western border with Austria in May. The open border was used by
thousands of East Germans, fed up with 40 years of hard-line
Communist rule, to flee to West Germany via Austria.
   ``As Hungary stood valiantly by our side in a difficult hour of
our history, we will not leave Hungary in the lurch on her way'' to
democracy and a market economy, Genscher said.
   Addressing a concern that has dominated the Hungarian election
campaign the past few days, Genscher also said he hoped the rights
of minorities, including those of the ethnic Hungarians in Romania,
would be respected.
   Hungarians feel a sense of kinship for the estimated 1.7 million
ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania, an area that belonged to Hungary
for centuries before being ceded to Romania after World War I.

<HEAD>Doubts Raised On Contra Disbandment Accord</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement to disband the Contra
rebels was in doubt Saturday because the outgoing Sandinista
government had not signed the pact and because of renewed fighting.
   The accord, signed Friday in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, by
representatives of the U.S.-backed rebels and the new government,
calls for a truce and immediate disbanding of the Contras. The
process would be completed before President-elect Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro takes office April 25 for a six-year term.
   However, no delegates from the Sandinista government took part
in talks that led to the pact or signed the accord.
   Also, there has been renewed fighting in the past week between
Sandinista and Contra forces, and one rebel commander said his
fighters will not lay down their arms until the Sandinista Army
does.
   The latest clash occurred Friday, when about 100 rebels ambushed
two army vehicles in the area around Jinotega, a town about 100
miles northeast of Managua. The Defense Ministry said 12 soldiers
died and eight were wounded. Four Contras were killed, the ministry
said.
   Medical sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in a
telephone interview that the attack occurred about the time the
accord was being announced in Tegucigalpa.
   President Daniel Ortega has repeatedly said the Contras must
disband before Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration if there is to be a
peaceful transfer of power.
   After learning of the accord, Ortega told a rally of youth
supporters in Managua late Friday that ``the weapons are now in the
hands of the people.''
   Ortega, quoted Saturday by the Sandinista newspaper Barricada,
did not elaborate. But his remark seemed to be a reference to
recent reports that the Sandinista army had distributed hundreds of
weapons among supporters in the provinces. There have also been
reports that the Sandinista army will not yield control to the new
government.
   The party newspaper voiced concern in an editorial, saying:
``There is still worry over the plans that the Contras have been
preparing to launch a great offensive.'' It said ``infiltrations
from Honduras continue, and that weapons are being hidden.''
   The editorial also pointed out that Contra military chief Israel
Galeano Cornejo, known as Commander Franklyn, had not signed the
pact for disbanding the rebels.
   He took part in the seven hours of talks, but his deputy, Oscar
Sovalbarro, signed the accord. Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's
representative, signed for the incoming leadership of the United
National Opposition. The document was witnessed by Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Managua.
   Sovalbarro later told reporters about 12,000 rebel fighters and
their families living in Honduran jungle camps planned to start
demobilizing over the weekend.
   The accord also calls for observers from the United Nations and
the Organization of American States to supervise the disbanding and
resettlement of the rebels and their families.
   Mrs. Chamorro's landslide victory in elections Feb. 25 ended a
decade of leftist Sandinista rule that was marked by close military
cooperation with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
   Shortly before the accord was reached, rebel commander Osvaldo
Galeano Cornejo accused the Sandinista army of ``repressing the
peasants'' in his area in southern Nicaragua. He said his forces
will not demobilize until the Sandinista army does the same.
   ``If we demobilize now, we would be leaving all these peasants
without protection,'' Galeano Cornejo, 22, the brother of Israel
Galeano Cornejo, told The Associated Press in an interview early
Friday.
   About 4,000 Contras are believed to be stationed in Nicaragua in
a north-south corridor from the Honduran border to Costa Rica.
Under the accord, they will move into security zones supervised by
Obando y Bravo and the United Nations.

<TEXT>
   An Amtrak train arriving from New Orleans hit a
bumper at the end of a track at Union Station on Saturday,
derailing cars and injuring at least 30 people, authorities said.
   ``The `City of New Orleans' train No. 53 struck the bumping
block at the end of the track, apparently throwing quite a few
people who were standing waiting to get off,'' said Amtrak
spokesman John Jacobsen.
   Trains normally would stop short of the bumper.
   Eight of the 10 cars derailed, Jacobsen said in a telephone
interview from Washington, D.C.
   He said the train was supposed to be traveling at about 3 mph in
the station, but police Patrolman John LeCompte said there were
reports that the train came in too fast.
   Jacobsen said the railroad was still investigating and hadn't
determined whether the accident was caused by human error or
mechanical failure.
   He said no damage to the train or the station was immediately
visible.
   ``It wasn't a serious accident from a railroad point of view,''
Jacobsen said. ``But when you are standing up it's just like
standing on an escalator _ if it stops fast, you fall down. People
get thrown, somebody else's suitcase hits them in the head ....''
   The train was carrying 254 passengers when it pulled into the
station just before noon, Jacobsen said.
   At least 30 people were taken to at least six hospitals, most
complaining of muscle, back or neck pains, hospital spokesmen said.
Late in the afternoon, many were still being evaluated in emergency
rooms, but it appeared most would be treated and released, the
spokesmen said.

<HEAD>Second Baltic Republic May Make Move Toward Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Latvian People's Front
said Saturday the first act of the republic's new parliament will
be a vote on independence.
   Dainis Ivans, President of the Latvian People's Front, said the
vote could come within six weeks, provided the pro-independence
group has enough support in parliament.
   The Front and other independence supporters won more than a 50
percent majority in the first round of elections for Latvia's new
parliament earlier this month. Ivans said they need to win only six
more of the 35 remaining races to have the two-thirds majority
needed for an independence vote.
   Ivans was in Vilnius to meet with leaders of the popular fronts
of Lithuania and Estonia to coordinate the Baltic republics'
campaigns for independence.
   Independence supporters took control of Lithuania's parliament
in recent elections, and the republic declared itself independent
on March 11 after five decades of Kremlin rule.
   Lithuania is in a confrontation with the Kremlin over its
declaration of indpendence and demands for talks on the issue.
Soviet tanks rolled through Vilnius Saturday in a show of force.
   However, Ivans said at a news conference late Saturday night
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised the Latvians
last week that he will begin negotiations with them on independence.
   Ivans said the Kremlin and Latvia have agreed to set up
committees to deal with the details of separation, including
politcal, economic and ecological issues.
   Ivans said the new Latvian parliament will hold its first
session by early May, and among its first acts will be to recognize
Lithuanian independence.
   He said increasing Kremlin pressure on Lithuania could prompt
Latvian and Estonian independence activists to speed their moves
toward independence as a way to support Lithuania.

<TEXT>
   An environmental group is asking voters to
ban the sale of canned tuna caught with huge drift nets that also
trap dolphins and other marine life.
   The United Community Action Network in Portland filed an
initiative petition with the Multnomah County Elections Division on
Friday seeking to declare the county the world's first ``tuna free
zone.''
   Initiative backers must collect 14,148 valid signatures over six
months to put the measure on the November general election or a
special election ballot.
   ``When we talk to people at the door, they have a lot of
sympathy for this issue,'' said Tom O'Keefe, director of the
7-month-old conservation group. ``Oregon has always been on the
cutting edge of environmental issues, and this gives them the
opportunity to speak loud again.''
   The measure would exempt the sale of canned tuna caught without
the use of drift nets, or purse seines, which contribute to the
death of an estimated 120,000 dolphins every year.
   The National Marine Fishery Service estimates that 6 million
dolphins have been killed since worldwide fleets started using the
nets in the 1950s. The United States, the only nation that
regulates the use of the huge nets, still allows a quota of 20,500
dolphin deaths a year.

<HEAD>School Worker Arrested in Death of 8-Year-Old Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fired elementary school employee
was arrested Saturday for investigation of killing an 8-year-old
student whose gagged and charred body was found in a roadside brush
fire, authorities said.
   Greg S. Smith, 21, was booked for investigation of murdering
Paul Bailly, a student at the Los Angeles school where Smith was a
playground supervisor, said Lt. Joe Harwell of the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department.
   An autopsy was performed but the county coroner was waiting for
the results of tests before declaring the cause of death.
   There were no obvious injuries to the boy other than the burning
and it was a possible he burned to death, Harwell said.
   The crime appalled people who work nearby or live in the
chapparal-covered hills west of Los Angeles' burgeoning San
Fernando Valley suburbs.
   ``It's the kind of thing that makes you wonder what kind of
animal does this kind of thing,'' said county Supervisor Madge
Schaefer.
   The body was found Friday by firefighters responding to a brush
fire in semirural Susana Knolls. A pair of handcuffs was found at
the scene. Harwell said detectives assume they were used on the boy.
   Smith, a resident of the Canoga Park section of Los Angeles who
has no criminal record, was fired from Darby Elementary School in
the San Fernando Valley suburb of Northridge two or three weeks ago.
   ``All we know at this time is he was terminated for cause,
evidently some problems there at the school,'' Harwell said.
   Vince France, detective commander of the sheriff's major crimes
division, said the firing involved ``inappropriate behavior.'' He
refused to elaborate.
   The boy was in a ``latchkey'' program of supervision for
students before and after school and Smith had been a supervisor,
Harwell said.
   The boy was last seen by his parents when he was dropped off at
the gate of the school at 7 a.m. Friday. Records show he never
arrived at school, and he was reported missing when he failed to
come back to his Canoga Park home.
   The body was found about 11:50 a.m. Friday.
   Witnesses had reported seeing a charcoal gray Honda or Toyota
sedan in the vicinity of the fire and detectives were watching
Smith's home and Honda sedan when he drove off at 5:30 a.m.
Saturday.
   Harwell alleged that Smith spotted the surveillance and tried to
evade the detectives.
   He was initially arrested for investigation of reckless driving
and evading arrest, and booked later in the murder case.
   Bailly's body, clad in a T-shirt, shorts, socks and sneakers,
was found less than 100 feet from Black Canyon Road. A flammable
liquid had been used to set the blaze.
   ``It's a particularly brutal crime, senseless,'' France said.

   Legislators who favor abortion rights
decided Saturday not to press a threat to force a House of
Delegates vote on abortion measures killed in committee the night
before.
   Also Saturday, 98 people were arrested in nearby Pasadena for
massing their bodies before the doors of a suburban abortion clinic
to block women from entering, Anne Arundel County police said.
   Abortion-rights forces decided against trying to force their
bill to the House floor because of opposition from the Democratic
leadership, said Delegate Samuel Rosenberg, a Baltimore Democrat
and abortion-rights leader
   Forcing the bill out of committee would have been ``an
extraordinary procedure, and it would set a precedent that many
people don't want to set,'' Rosenberg said. He insisted, however,
that the bill had the votes to pass in the House.
   The decision was the final chapter in a 10-day abortion debate
in the Maryland General Assembly that produced a lot of drama but
no legislation.
   While the abortion clinic demonstration by Project Rescue
coincided with the close of debate by lawmakers in Annapolis, group
spokeswoman Dee Silverman said the demonstration had been planned
several months ago.
   The demonstrators were arrested under a new law, signed into
effect in July and aimed at just such demonstrations, which
prohibits interference with entrance or departure from a medical
facility.
   The failed Maryland compromise was approved by the state Senate
to end an eight-day filibuster on abortion.
   The unusual arrangement would have required the legislature to
pass two measures: one permitting unrestricted access to abortions
during the early stages of pregnancy, the other restricting
abortion to cases of rape, incest or dire threat to the mother.
Complicated referendum procedures would have dumped the matter in
the laps of the voters in November.
   Anti-abortion forces are looking to legislation in Idaho and the
U.S. territory of Guam for a vehicle to challenge the U.S. Supreme
Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   Guam enacted the nation's strictest abortion law, but a federal
judge temporarily blocked it after a class-action lawsuit Friday.
   In Idaho, where the most restrictive abortion measure passed by
any state legislature was approved Thursday, the focus of the
debate shifted to the economic ramifications.
   Abortion-rights interests in California, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Rhode Island and North Carolina have threatened to boycott Idaho
potatoes unless Gov. Cecil Andrus vetoes the bill. Andrus opposes
abortion but has not said what he will do.
   The Idaho Legislature voted to ban abortion except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or threat to the
mother's life or health.
   Some Idaho legislators were surprised by the threatened potato
boycott.
   ``Oh, my Lord,'' said state Rep. Steve Antone, one of nine
potato growers in the Legislature who all voted for abortion
restrictions. ``It would be a tremendous blow to the state.'' He
added that the possibility of a boycott ``didn't occur to us at the
time.''
   But state Sen. Mark Ricks, who co-chaired the abortion hearings,
said a potato boycott would not have much effect this year, because
potatoes are in short supply and prices at all-time highs.
   Barbara Labadie, Republican co-chair of the Michigan Women's
Political Caucus, said she usually serves her family potatoes three
or four times a week. But now, she said, ``We'll just switch to
rice and noodles.''

   Scores of canoes carrying anti-nuclear
demonstrators entered a restricted area at the Kings Bay Naval
Submarine Base on Saturday to protest deployment of the first
submarine to carry Trident II missiles.
   The protesters agreed to leave the area peacefully and police
and Coast Guard officials reported no arrests.
   The demonstration was organized by the Greenpeace environmental
group and two other organizations. A Greenpeace ship, the 60-foot
ketch Mondcivitano, took part.
   About 75 people gathered for the protest in anticipation of the
upcoming departure of the USS Tennessee, which will carry 24
Trident II missiles, said Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan.
Each Trident II missile carries eight warheads.
   Lt. Cmdr. Patricia McMillan, public affairs officer for Kings
Bay, said the protest had ``no effect on the operations'' of the
base.
   ``The Navy is committed to protecting the rights of groups to
conduct peaceful non-intrusive protests,'' she said, reading from a
statement. ``However, freedom of speech and freedom of navigation
do not equate to freedom to obstruct or endanger the legitimate
activities of the U.S. government through dangerous actions by
protesters.''
   Ms. Fagan said there was concern that the submarine had already
gone to sea because neither the boats that entered the security
zone nor Greenpeace officials flying over the base could spot the
sub in the bay.

<HEAD>Mandela Calls for End to Exploitation of Black Farm Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said Saturday
the country's black farm laborers are being exploited and called on
rural towns to end segregated public facilities.
   ``No white farmer has yet gone to prison for the murder of one
of their workers, nor will that happen for as long as farmers
continue to enjoy the protection of local police and magistrates,''
the anti-apartheid leader said at an African National Congress
rally in Nelspruit.
   He cited the case of a white farmer who was recently fined only
$34 after his black worker died as a result of a beating.
   Mandela said the white towns in eastern Transvaal province,
where he spoke, were deeply racist and should immediately end
segregation of recreational areas and other public facilities.
   The government announced Friday it intends to allow state-funded
schools to become multi-racial by January if 90 percent of the
parents at a particular school favor the move.
   President F.W. de Klerk has been pushing a series of racial
reforms. He has called for ending the apartheid system of racial
segregation and for holding talks on allowing the black majority an
equal political role with whites.
   De Klerk has also said the law allowing municipalities to
segregate public facilities would be repealed this year.
   In February, the president released Mandela, who had been in
prison since 1962 on a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the white government.
   Mandela, vice president of the ANC, has been campaigning
virtually non-stop since then for an end to apartheid.
   At Saturday's rally, he called for an end to the land tenancy
system that allows farmers to require the entire families of black
laborers to work. He condemned the lack of legal protection for
farm workers and said they should be allowed full trade union
rights.
   Mandela also demanded an inquiry into reports that Mozambican
guerrillas have bases inside South Africa.
   President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique has said he accepts de
Klerk's assurances that the South African government no longer
supports the Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas.
   But Mozambican government officials believe the guerrillas still
receive support from across the border, and South African newspaper
reports have recently cited new evidence of such backing.
   Mandela called on de Klerk to appoint a commission to
investigate.
   In Soweto, the largest black township outside Johannesburg,
police fired tear gas Saturday to disperse thousands of protestors
marching toward municipal offices to demand better services. They
also demanded that the town council resign.
   Journalists said some protesters pelted riot police with stones
during a 10-minute battle, but no one was reported injured.

<TEXT>
   For nearly four hours in the predawn
dark, Lithuanian legislators joked nervously and prepared for the
worst as Soviet tanks headed toward the capitol, then rolled on by
without firing a shot.
   While the city slept early Saturday, 98 members of Parliament
watched and traded macabre jokes as paratroopers armed with
automatic weapons, 59 armored vehicles and 50 trucks clanked toward
the building.
   From midnight until nearly 4:00 a.m., they did not know if
Lithuania's attempt to declare its independence from the Soviet
Union would end in blood 13 days after it began.
   Despite Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise he would
not use force, the psychological warfare escalated during the week
with ultimatums, demands that Lithuanians disarm and shows of
military force.
   ``We were almost sure they would not'' use force, said
legislator Audres Butkavicius.
   But as the hours wore on Saturday morning, after Lithuanian
police alerted the Parliament to the column of armor 45 miles from
Vilnius, the jokes tended toward lines such as, ``Remember
Allende,'' and ``Remember Czechoslovakia,'' said legislator Valdas
Katkus.
   The references were to the Marxist president of Chile who died
in a 1973 coup and the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that ended
Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring reforms.
   ``We decided we were equal forces,'' since the first report put
the number of vehicles in the column at 98 _ the same number of
deputies still in the parliament chamber after midnight, said
legislator Juozas Karvelis.
   ``Some people were nervous, especially when they noticed that
the Communist Party leaders were not among us,'' Karvelis said.
``We decided they knew something and we didn't.''
   Karvelis' was joking, but his quip displayed an element of doubt
about the status of Lithuanian Communist leaders. Most of those
elected in the republic's recent parliamentary elections broke with
Moscow to support Lithuanian independence.
   The Comminist Party leader, Algirdas Brazauskas, said he left
the session Friday evening and slept right through the excitement.
   As the lawmakers who remained smiled and joked, they prepared
for the worst.
   Their concern was heightened because two Soviet ultimatums
expired on Saturday: one threatening forcible capture of Lithuanian
deserters from the Soviet army and the other ordering a halt to the
organization of a Lithuanian border guard.
   At 2:25 a.m., the parliament's press office sent an urgent
message to international news media saying the tanks were just 18
kilometers away.
   ``Please help spread the news,'' it pleaded.
   By that time, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis had
suggested adoption of a resolution stating that in the event of
Soviet aggression, government power would be delegated to the man
who has served as Lithuania's diplomatic representative in
Washington for years, Stasys Lozoraitis.
   Deputies rangled over the wording, finally prompting an
exasperated Landsbergis to warn that the Soviet troops could arrive
before they acted.
   At 2:43 a.m. the legislators adopted the resolution. Less than
an hour later, about 30 deputies raced from the building building
to lean over a railing 100 yards away and watch the armor rumble
past, a seemingly endless row of headlights in the dark.
   At that point they still did not know if the force would veer
off the highway to take over the city.
   Butkavicius said he found a soldier from the neighboring
sympathetic republic of Latvia who told him the unit was heading
for the Siaures Miestelis army base in north Vilnius.
   Karvelis said there was still enough concern that 10 lawmakers
spent what remained of the night in the parliament building with
Landsbergis in case the army came to arrest him.
   ``We are not afraid,'' Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said
at 4:00 a.m. ``But we don't know what they want, and we don't know
what will happen next.''
   It was not just Lithuania's fate that seemed uncertain Saturday
morning, said legislator Volodya Yarmolenko.
   ``If the situation is destabilized here, it will be destabilized
throughout the Soviet Union,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll: Majority of Japanese Think Japan Trade Policies Are Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Japanese say their country's trade
policies with the United States are unfair, and they also say
they're losing respect for this country, a poll has found.
   The poll, reported in the April 2 issue of Newsweek magazine,
found that 48 percent of Japanese surveyed think Tokyo should make
it easier for Americans to sell their products in Japan.
   The poll found 52 percent of Japanese feel Japan's trade policy
is unfair. Another Newsweek poll published Oct. 9, 1989, found the
same percentage of Americans believed the same thing.
   Seventy-seven percent of Japanese polled said the main reason
for the trade gap is that Japanese products offer more value and
quality than American goods. Forty-two percent of Americans said
the same thing in the October survey.
   The new poll also found the Japanese are losing respect for the
United States, that relations between the two nations are
worsening, and that 82 percent believe abuse of illegal drugs and
alcohol hurt the U.S. economy.
   The Gallup Organization's Japanese affiliate, Nippon Research
Center, conducted the new poll and the Gallup Organization
conducted the October poll.
   The Nippon Research Center interviewed 785 Japanese adults
between Jan. 19 and Jan. 24. For the Oct. 9 poll, 600 adults were
interviewed Sept. 28 and 29. The margin of error for both polls is
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Among the findings of the Japanese poll:
   _That 33 percent of Japanese have less respect for the United
States than they did five years ago. Only 13 percent said they have
a lot of respect for the United States.
   _That 31 percent believe relations between the two nations are
getting worse, with 54 percent saying it is at least somewhat
likely that Japan will become an enemy of the United States.
   In the October U.S. survey, 52 percent of Americans said Japan's
economic power was a greater threat to the United States than the
Soviet Union's military power.
   The poll did find some positive views of the United States among
Japanese. A large majority, 73 percent, saw the United States as a
superpower with few problems, while only 16 percent saw this
country in an irreversible decline.

   A high school band played and children
sang and read poems Saturday as 7,000 people welcomed members of
the International Trans-Antarctica Expedition and their dogs back
to Minnesota.
   ``This is the greatest moment in my life right here,''
expedition co-leader Will Steger told the crowd in front of the
State Capitol. ``We certainly felt your prayers. It got us through
some almost seemingly impossible situations.''
   Steger, of Ely, and his five fellow adventurers, each
representing different nations, made the longest unmechanized
passage across the frozen continent. Their 3,100-mile, 219-day ski
and dog sled journey ended March 3.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich said the expedition symbolized the potential
for international cooperation, and proclaimed Saturday
International Trans-Antarctica Day.
   ``Our journey into the future, like the journey across the
Antarctic, cannot be made solely by one country or by one people,''
Perpich said. ``It must be made by all of us as partners.''
   Some of the dogs that pulled the sleds across the continent were
introduced to the crowd.
   ``I also want to recognize the true heroes and the real
ambassadors of the expedition, the dogs,'' Steger said. ``It was
their strength and their power that pulled the burden on this
trip.''
   A chilly wind blew across the ceremony.
   ``I had a feeling that Minnesota was colder that Antarctica,''
said Soviet researcher and team member Victor Boyarsky. ``But after
this warm welcome, we are very, very hot.''
   Tim Setterdahl, a sixth-grade student from Rio, Ill., read part
of a winning essay he wrote calling for an international treaty to
preserve Antarctica. ``Antarctica is supposed to be a peaceful
place and it should stay the way it is now, peaceful,'' the
11-year-old read. ``If a war ever happened, it would never be the
same again.''
   Steger and expedition co-leader Jean-Louise Etienne of France
have expressed concern that Antarctica's pristine environment could
be destroyed by nations competing to exploit its potential mineral
wealth.
   The other team members were Geoff Somers of Great Britain, Keizo
Funatsu of Japan and Qin Dahe of China.
   The six men were scheduled to be in Washington, D.C., on Monday
for appearances at the National Press Club. A Senate reception was
set for Monday night and, on Tuesday, they are to appear at a White
House ceremony.

<HEAD>International Rafting Competition In Smoky Mountains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 250 people from 14 nations
have been competing and getting to know each other for the past
week along fast-flowing rivers in the Great Smoky Mountains.
   ``Rapid Diplomacy'' and ``Paddling for Peace'' say signs around
the Nantahala Outdoor Center, a rafting complex on the Nantahala
River near Bryson City where most events are being held in the
Nantahala '90. It's the first international white water rafting
rally held in the United States.
   ``I think it is a great, great opportunity to bring people
together and let everyone share their feelings,'' said Costa Rican
rafter Gilda Montenegro. The contest ends Sunday.
   The event originated with the Soviets. For years, they held a
competition in Siberia for themselves. Last year, they invited
Americans and others.
   At the end of the Siberian event, Payson Kennedy, chairman and
founder of the Nantahala Outdoors Center, invited competitors to
hold the 1990 event there. Whitewater rafting has become a big
money-maker in western North Carolina and adjacent Georgia and
South Carolina.
   The Soviet Union sent 11 teams with more than 75 people to
compete in Nantahala '90, which ends Sunday. One Soviet rafter,
Gene Bokov, is a newspaper editor who has just been elected a
senator in the country's first free elections in 70 years.
   Nationalities have been left behind. The Americans and Soviets
have a joint team. The Nepalese team borrowed some Americans. A
United Germany team already includes an East German.
   Eugene Dodolev, a Soviet reporter-TV producer, took leave of the
competition Thursday and went hitchhiking to explore the nearby
town of Andrews.
   ``America is exactly like I expected,'' he said in excellent
English learned from listening to Beatles records. ``Big cars. Big
skyscrapers in New York. Big houses. Big Macs. Big plates with lots
of food. Big country.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Names Key Aides to New Government Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday named
his key Communist Party aides to a new presidential advisory
council in a move to transfer political power from the party to the
government.
   The top advisers _ Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
Alexander N. Yakovlev, as well as the chiefs of the military and
secret police _ are among five members of the party's ruling
Politburo selected for the Presidential Council.
   The official Tass news agency said Gorbachev also picked two
well-known writers, an economist, and two parliamentarians to serve
on the council.
   Although Gorbachev assumed the position of president more than a
year ago, real power remained with the party.
   The party has been controlled by its Central Committee of a few
hundred of the party elite, the top leaders in the Moscow-based
Politburo and Gorbachev himself as general secretary.
   However, the party has been under attack from many quarters for
its handling of the economy and other matters. Earlier this year,
it renounced its 70-year monopoly on power.
   By presidential decree, the new council will be housed in the
Kremlin, where Gorbachev also will have his presidential office.
   New constitutional amendments establishing a strong presidency
provide for the president's appointment of a Presidential Council
to be ``responsible for implementing the major lines of domestic
and foreign policy and ensuring the security of the country.''
   The prime minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, is the only ex-officio
member of the council. There is no fixed number of appointees, nor
any requirement that council members meet as a group.
   But the council offers Gorbachev a mechanism for bringing his
chosen aides and advisers into the government, instead of relying
on their positions in the party leadership to give them regular
access to him.
   In addition to Ryzhkov, Shevardnadze and Yakovlev, the panel
will be composed of Yuri D. Maslyukov, head of the State Planning
Committee, which controls the centrally planned economy; Vladimir
A. Kryuchkov, chairman of the KGB; Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, the
minister of defense; Albert Kauls and Venyamin Yarin of the
Congress of People's Deputies; writers Valentin Rasputin and
Chingiz Aitmatov of Kirghizia; and economist Stanislav S. Shatalin.
   Kauls runs the Adazhi agricultural production firm in Riga,
Latvia, that has been cited as a model for moving from a centrally
planned to a market economy. Yarin is a worker at a steelmaking
complex in Nizhni Tagil in the Ural Mountains.

   The Soviet Union is entitled to pursue
deserters from its army but should not act against the independence
movement in Luthuania, Vice President Dan Quayle said Saturday.
   ``What is happening is a very subtle display of force that, in
fact, is trying to intimidate the people of Lithuania not to go
ahead with their independence,'' Quayle told reporters in Arizona,
en route to a vacation in Hawaii.
   The United States is ``squarely on the side of Lithuania'' and
has never recognized the ``agreement between two evil men, Hitler
and Stalin,'' that made Lithuania part of the Soviet Union, Quayle
said.
   Since Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union
on March 11, Soviet leaders have warned Lithuania to return and
Friday a military adviser to Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev
said they would try to round up deserters in Lithuania after a
deadline passed for them to return.
   While the Soviet Union should not threaten Lithuania, ``if the
Soviet Union is applying disciplinary measures to people in their
own military, that's a different situation,'' Quayle said.
   ``I do not know what kinds of contractual agreement a member of
the Soviet army has when he or she signs up,'' Quayle said, but
there is a ``certain element of discipline that is absolutely
imperative in any armed force.''
   Quayle also drew a distinction between turmoil in the Caucasus
region, where Quayle said Soviet military intervention was
justified to prevent ethnic violence, and the situation in
Lithuania, which he described as an independence movement.
   The Caucasus battle ``was a civil disorder'' where the Soviet
Union ``had the responsibility to keep law and order,'' the vice
president said.
   ``Lithuania is an entirely different situation, this is not one
group fighting against another group on an ethnic basis,'' Quayle
added.
   He declined to say what counter measures the United States might
take, but felt sympathy for Gorbachev in the situation.
   ``This will be a test to see if new thinking is going to
continue in the Soviet Union or whether there will be a relapse to
the old way of thinking,'' he said.

<HEAD>Industry Minister Wants End to Daylight-Savings Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital's half-dozen timekeepers worked
furiously Saturday to set 2,500 public clocks an hour ahead, but
the industry minister thinks it's time Europe did away with the
daylight-savings ritual.
   France and the 11 other nations of the European Community added
one hour to their clocks at 2 a.m. Sunday to take advantage of an
extra hour of evening sunlight through the summer.
   Industry Minister Roger Faroux, however, wants to end the
practice, citing a recent ministry report showing the benefits are
nil and that nearly half the population dislikes the change.
   ``The French like less and less being told what hour to get up
and what hour to sleep,'' Faroux was quoted as saying in Saturday's
editions of the newspaper Le Parisien. ``It's rude to impose
changes on citizens in their private lives.''
   France went to daylight-savings time in 1976 along with Belgium,
the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain as an energy-savings measure
to deal with the oil crisis.
   The European Community has coordinated the practice among
members so that their clocks get turned forward the last Sunday of
March. The agreement expires next year, however, and Faroux wants
France to lobby the EC to keep clocks on one 24-hour cycle all year
long.
   Faroux says the amount of energy saved by daylight-savings time
is negligible now that France is powered mostly by nuclear energy.
   Last October, he asked the National Assembly to open an
investigation into the benefits of the extra hour.
   A survey conducted during the investigation showed 44 percent of
French citizens oppose daylight-savings time and 57 percent feel it
has not improved their quality of life.
   An end to the twice-annual change could find favor with Paris'
six official clock-keepers. They make a two-day, 435-mile circuit
twice a year to reset hands and bells and keep the capital's 2,500
clocks on the hour.
   ``The Parisians are really picky about time,'' said chief
clock-keeper Marc Bintz. ``One pendulum badly set can set off a
miniscandal in a neighborhood.''

<TEXT>
   A group of 23 Western nations said
Saturday it will open its arms wider to membership by Eastern
Europe's fledgling democracies.
   However, some officials reminded would-be members of the group's
stringent standards for protecting human rights.
   Delegates at the two-day meeting of the Council of Europe
reached broad agreement that the Soviet Union and its former East
European satellites are genuinely interested in building
democracies, despite shaky foundations.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Kashlev described the
meeting as ``very satisfying.''
   ``The message was that the Council of Europe opens its doors to
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   The meeting was billed as the widest all-European forum since
World War II. Most of the 23 members of the council, which is based
in Strasbourg, France, were represented by foreign ministers.
   Founded in 1949, the group is the oldest postwar organization
striving for European unity. It has been overshadowed, however, by
the better known European Community.
   The Kremlin once ridiculed the council as a propaganda tool for
the capitalist West and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
even though the United States is not a council member.
   But now Moscow sees the group as a possible cornerstone for
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's vision of a common European
home that might eventually replace NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact.
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerard Collins, chairman of the European
Community Ministers' Council, welcomed closer cooperation with the
East. He said such collaboration would not slow the process of
creating a single EC market after 1992.
   ``It's indubitable that the Community will continue to be the
motor behind economic cooperation and development,'' he said.
   Earlier, Catherine Lalumiere, the Council of Europe's
secretary-general, told a news conference: ``All countries of
Central and Eastern Europe affirmed they have pluralistic
democracies and respect for human rights as principle goals.''
   ``We want to give them assistance to realize those objectives,''
she said.
   But several Western delegates _ including William Waldegrave,
East European expert for Britain's Foreign Ministry and Spanish
Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez _ said the council
should strictly maintain its defense of human rights when
considering new members.
   After four decades of totalitarian rule, some Eastern European
nations are seeking help in creating new penal codes and
overhauling once token parliaments.
   Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union already hold
what officials call ``special guest status'' in the Council of
Europe. Bulgaria, East Germany and Czecholovakia have applied for
similar status.
   Yugoslavia, Poland and Hungary have requested full membership.
Council officials said Friday that Hungary could join before the
end of 1990.

   An Wang, a shy inventor whose one-man shop set
above a hardware store grew under his leadership into a
billion-dollar competitor in the world computer market, died
Saturday of cancer. He was 70.
   Wang died at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was
admitted March 6 after a setback in a long fight against cancer of
the esophagus, said hospital spokesman Martin Bander. He was first
operated on July 14 for the cancer, which recurred this month,
Bander said.
   He held more than 40 patents and was inducted into the National
Inventors Hall of Fame in March 1988. He received the Medal of
Liberty from President Reagan.
   Wang, a slight, Chinese-born engineer, began Wang Laboratories
Inc. in 1951 above an electrical fixtures store in Boston. The
company grew to become a leader in office word-processing equipment
in the 1970s.
   He developed the magnetic core, a product central to the
fledgling computer industry. The small ring of iron was the basic
element of computer memory until the microchip was introduced in
the late 1960s.
   ``An Wang was the personification of the American dream. His
genius and his generosity made it possible for others to reach
their dreams,'' Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said in a statement
Saturday.
   ``Dr. Wang's genius helped spark the high-tech revolution, and
his vision helped guide it,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said in a
statement. ``In addition, his commitment to social justice made him
a pioneer in employee relations as well.''
   He was ``quiet, humble, brilliant, decisive, caring, a great
man, a one-of-a-kind person,'' said Paul Guzzi, a Wang spokesman
sometimes called his right-hand man. ``I think all of us who have
been associated with him know he was a great man.''
   Wang felt strongly enough about his company to fire his own
eldest son, Frederick, as chief operating officer and president
after huge losses were posted in the late 1980s.
   The growth of Wang Laboratories accelerated in 1964 after Wang
introduced a desktop calculator. He steered his company around the
plunge of the calculator market by focusing on the development of
office computers.
   ``Looking at the results of the company over a long period of
time, clearly, you have a visionary there,'' said Tobey Choate,
vice president of information technology consulting at Arthur D.
Little Inc.
   Because of the company's growth, Wang moved it northwest of
Boston to Lowell in 1976. The move helped revitalize the declining
manufacturing city.
   A leader in word processing equipment in the 1970s, Wang
Laboratories stumbled in the 1980s. Analysts criticized the company
for sticking with its proprietary systems instead of moving quickly
into IBM-compatible machines. In recent years, its sales of
minicomputers have been hurt by competition from powerful personal
computers and workstations.
   Harsh retrenching and the sale of non-strategic assets has cut
the company's bank debt from $575 million last summer to under $100
million, with more cuts to come, Guzzi said.
   The cutbacks have trimmed the company's worldwide work force
from 28,000 to about 22,500, said Ed Pignone, another Wang
spokesman.
   Frederick Wang, who became company president in 1986 at age 36,
stepped down in August after a weekend of discussions with his
father, who had remained chief executive officer.
   In December, the company announced it would offer new products
compatible with industrywide standards.
   Guzzi said Richard W. Miller, a former General Electric
executive who succeeded Frederick Wang, is in charge of the company
and will continue with the planned strategies. The board of
directors plans to meet Wednesday to review candidates for chief
executive officer, Guzzi said.
   Choate, the technology consultant, said the loss of the
company's founder could hurt morale at a crucial time.
   ``Clearly, he was the spiritual leader at the company,'' Choate
said. ``Take away people's spiritual leader and you take the wind
out of their sails.''
   Wang's success enabled him to be a philanthropist. He supported
education and the arts, including development of the Wang Center
for the Performing Arts in Boston.
   ``I think it's a terrible loss. He was an exceptional man and
someone I looked up to personally,'' said Josiah Spaulding, who
heads the center.
   Wang's gift of $3.5 million to the center in 1983 propelled the
theater from a terrible financial position and deteriorating image
to a success, Spaulding said.
   A native of Shanghai, Wang was a schoolteacher's son who came to
the United States in 1945. He received a doctorate in physics from
Harvard University in 1948.
   A small man who favored bow ties, Wang shied from publicity,
declining interviews and keeping public appearances to a minimum.
   ``He was very private, and in many ways led a very private
life,'' Guzzi said.
   Wang is survived by his wife, Lorraine; two sons, Frederick, who
remained with the company working on special projects, and
Courtney, a Wang vice president; and a daughter, Juliette, a
student.
   Funeral arrangements are pending.

   Thousands of people lined the streets
Saturday to mourn a presidential candidate allegedly slain by drug
traffickers. Opposition parties suspended their campaigns and
demanded postponement of the May election.
   Bernardo Jaramillo was shot point-blank Thursday at Bogota's
airport. Police blamed drug traffickers.
   Drug traffickers killed the governing party's presidential
hopeful, Luis Carlos Galan, in August, sparking a bloody war
between the government and drug lords.
   ``The right to life has disappeared completely,'' the
Conservative Party candidate, Rodrigo Lloreda, told reporters late
Friday at a news conference. ``The government is not even providing
that minimum guarantee.''
   The Conservative Party, the country's main opposition, joined
Jaramillo's Patriotic Union and other leftist parties late Friday
in suspending their campaigns.
   They demanded that President Virgilio Barco postpone the May 27
presidential election and provide additional security for
candidates. The communique from the opposition parties did not
suggest a new date for elections.
   Barco, of the governing Liberal Party, did not respond to the
demands. The party's leader in the House of Representatives,
Norberto Morales, said the election should take place on the date
prescribed by law.
   Jaramillo's body was carried from the Capitol building to
Bogota's main cemetery Saturday in a symbolic funeral. He will be
buried Sunday in his hometown of Manizales, 120 miles northwest of
Bogota.
   Radio reports said some 20,000 people, many of them crying and
waving white handkerchiefs, lined the streets.
   Several small explosions intended to cause panic occurred during
the ceremony, but authorities controlled the situation using riot
police and armored cars, said police spokesman Luis Enrique Avila.
No injuries were reported.
   The Liberal Party put off its Saturday convention until after
Jaramillo's burial.
   The governing party is expected to ratify as its candidate Cesar
Gaviria, who won a March 11 primary. By law, Barco cannot run for
re-election.
   Colombia's intellegence police said their investigations had
shown that the leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo
Escobar, ordered Jaramillo killed. Escobar denied the charge in a
letter Friday to the Patriotic Union.
   Diego Montana, president of the Patriotic Union, repeated his
suggestion that the government was indirectly responsible for
Jaramillo's death.
   ``I don't know how a government that permits the elimination of
the opposition can call itself Liberal,'' he said during a joint
news conference with Lloreda.
   Disturbances broke out Thursday almost immediately after
Jaramillo's death. One soldier was killed by a sniper and six
police officers were wounded before the street fighting was
controlled early Friday, Avila said.
   The government has repeatedly denied the Patriotic Union's
accusations that military forces have carried out an extermination
campaign against the party. Assassins have killed 1,044 of its
members in the last four years.
   Police investigations have held that most of the assassinations
were perpetrated by hitmen working for drug traffickers.
   The communique from the opposition parties said foreign
observors should oversee the electoral process in Colombia. The
document was also signed by the Communist Party, the Socialist
Workers' Party and the April 19 Movement, a former guerrilla group
that laid down its arms earlier this month.

   In the worst of times, when Joseph
Hazelwood's name was splashed in headlines and the lawsuits rolled
in like the tide, the Exxon Valdez skipper remembers identifying
with the persecuted hero of a classic novel.
   ``The book was `Les Miserables,''' he said, ``and it seemed like
I was Jean Valjean with a hundred inspectors chasing me around in
the sewers of Paris.''
   Later, in an Anchorage courtroom, he remembered a line he had
read about the justice system being ``a meat grinder, a sausage
grinder _ you go into it in one form and you come out something
else.''
   ``I went in there reasonably starry-eyed that justice would be
done ...,'' he said. ``If anything, I'm more cynical now.''
   Hazelwood, who had just been acquitted of three major charges
and convicted of a low-level misdemeanor in the nation's worst oil
spill, reflected Friday on the year that changed his life in his
first interview since his trial began two months ago.
   Later in the day, he was sentenced to pay $50,000 restitution
and spend 1,000 hours helping clean up the oiled beaches of Prince
William Sound.
   He was asked in the interview how he felt about all the wildlife
killed as the result of his oil spill.
   ``It was a terrible tragedy,'' he said. ``There's no getting
around it. ``It will affect me as it will affect everybody for a
long time.''
   The 43-year-old skipper talked of his past and future after
being acquitted of criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and
operating a vessel while intoxicated. He was convicted of negligent
discharge of oil.
   His lawyers stood by as he spoke, blocking detailed comments
about the events of March 24, 1989, when his ship went aground in
Prince William Sound spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
Civil suits remain to be faced.
   Hazelwood remembered his feelings when the tanker hit a charted
reef.
   ``It was just like a big punch in the gut, like the wind's
knocked out of you but there's no recovering,'' he said.
   Soon, there were headlines alleging he was drunk while in
command _ an issue that stings Hazelwood even though jurors
rejected it, noting that blood-alcohol tests on the captain weren't
done until more than 10 hours after the grounding.
   ``I resented it, yeah,'' he said. ``The dragging in of my
private life into a public arena. ... Alcohol didn't have anything
to do with this. It's the biggest red herring. ... It made for nice
splashy headlines. If I was an ax murderer ashore, would that have
made this a splashier grounding?''
   The tall, balding Hazelwood, clad in a red and white rugby shirt
and tan corduroy slacks in the hotel room interview, described
himself as ``a reasonably normal, anonymous person'' before the
grounding.
   ``I'm Joe Schmo, a boat driver basically, and you get thrust
into this limelight, catapulted into this starring role. I wasn't
equipped for it.''
   Maybe, he said, Zsa Zsa Gabor could handle it, or Oliver North.
But not Joe Hazelwood.
   Who was Joe Hazelwood? He was born in Hawkinsville, Ga. His
father was a Marine Corps aviator and commercial 747 pilot. An
older sister and one brother became lawyers. Another brother
conducts the Battle Creek, Mich., symphony.
   The family moved to Long Island when Hazelwood was a teen-ager,
and he still lives there, in Huntington, N.Y. His wife, Suzanne, is
a former nurse and they have a 14-year-old daughter, Alison.
   The call of the sea came early.
   ``There was a romance to the sea when I started out,'' he said,
recalling how he signed up at 14 to sail on fishing boats.
   ``I wanted to see what was over the horizon, and I found out,''
he said.
   Now, in the world of high tech, computerized tankers, ``It's
developed into a pretty sterile atmosphere.''
   ``It's not the captain lashed to the wheel or Errol Flynn flying
through the rigging,'' he said. ``It's pretty low key. That was the
biggest problem with the trial other than pretrial publicity,
educating the jury on how ships operate.''
   To accomplish that, Hazelwood turned to an old school chum,
Michael Chalos, who was his classmate at the New York University
Maritime Academy at Fort Schuyler, N.Y.
   Chalos, a jovial, outgoing lawyer, put together the defense
team, and Hazelwood, quiet and reflective, grew as close as
brothers. Asked what sustained him during the trial, Hazelwood
said, ``Mostly it was Michael and his effervescent personality.''
   Hazelwood said he will be paying court costs for a long time.
His retirement savings and contributions from friends went into the
defense. He said Exxon offered no financial help.
   For weeks at the trial, he sat and watched his former shipmates
testify against him. How did that feel?
   ``They're shipmates and friends. They were just telling the
truth,'' he said. ``I'm sure they didn't want to submarine me, do
me any harm.''
   He credited them with showing jurors what a topnotch crew had
manned the Exxon Valdez, saying, ``They showed themselves to be
professionals.''
   Hazelwood even declines to fault the captains who took the stand
for the prosecution and called him reckless. ``That was their
opinion,'' he said.
   But he insisted that the procedure of a captain leaving the
ship's bridge in the hands of other officers is not unusual _
``It's standard operating procedure.''
   Once, about 17 years ago, he sailed as a junior officer on a
freighter from New York to South Africa.
   ``The captain said to me: `Can you find South Africa?' I said,
`Yes, sir.' He said, `Call me when we get there,''' Hazelwood
recalled.
   Does he think he was a scapegoat?
   ``I always thought scapegoat was kind of a strong word,'' he
said. ``I was a convenient lightning rod for a lot of agendas.
Using me served their purposes well to deflect the limelight. ... A
year ago, many people were outraged and you had corporations,
entities, these nameless, faceless organizations.
   ``Everyone wanted this person to relate to, another human being,
not an office building. They wanted a person to vent their
frustrations on and, unfortunately, it was me.''
   Now, with the trial behind him, Hazelwood dreams again of the
sea.
   ``I'd like to sail as the master of something again,'' he said,
but is unsure whether he wants to fight for his old job with Exxon.
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I'm ambivalent about them.''
   Asked to talk about his immediate future, Hazelwood seemed
perplexed. He hasn't had times to make plans.
   Where would he like to be a year from now?
   ``At sea,'' he said. ``Going somewhere and coming from
somewhere.''

<HEAD>Texas Gubernatorial Candidate Compares Bad Weather to Rape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALPINE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton
Williams, preparing for a cattle round-up at his West Texas ranch
Saturday, compared the rainy, cold weather spoiling the event to a
rape.
   ``If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it,'' Williams said
to ranchhands and reporters invited to the event.
   After the day's ranching activities, Williams apologized.
   ``This is a cow camp ... barnyard language and you came to the
barn,'' Williams said. ``That's just a joke.''
   Asked if some people be offended by his using the old joke,
Williams said: ``I'm not going to give you a serious answer. It
wasn't a serious deal. It wasn't a serious statement.''
   William's wife, Modesta, defended him.
   ``If the word rape was in a joke, if sex was in a joke, it was
just a joke,'' she said. ``He's as much a gentleman and as caring
as there is.''
   Asked if she thought the reporters' questions were unfair, Mrs.
Williams said: ``I sure do ... Sitting out here around a campfire,
and somebody says a joke, I just don't think that's right
behavior.''
   Williams said the episode may change the way he deals with
reporters.
   ``You're out here to see what kind of person I am. If you try to
take something like that and make it into a big deal, it's
ridiculous,'' said Williams, who is making his first run for public
office.
   ``I've been a cowboy most of my life. I didn't change myself.
That's who I am, for better or for worse,'' Williams said.
   Williams won the March 13 primary over three major challengers,
spending more than $6 million of his oil, ranching and business
fortune on the campaign. He has said he owns no shoes, only cowboy
boots, and his campaign TV commercials often featured him wearing a
cowboy hat.
   Williams will face either state Treasurer Ann Richards or
Attorney General Jim Mattox in the November general election. Ms.
Richards and Mattox are in the April 10 run-off for the Democratic
nomination.

   Lithuania's president likened his
Baltic republic to an occupied land on Saturday and said a convoy
of Soviet tanks that rumbled through the capital had heightened
fears of a clash with Moscow.
   Nervous Lithuanian lawmakers voted to transfer their power to
foreign soil if they were assaulted or arrested, and polls opened
for multiparty elections to local governing councils.
   Young Lithuanians who deserted the Soviet army when their
republic declared independence took refuge at a hospital Saturday
night, hoping a pair of policemen and a few Red Cross signs would
protect them from arrest by Soviet authorities. Lithuanian
officials recommended they seek refuge in churches.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry ordered foreign
diplomats, including two Americans, out of Lithuania and said
foreign journalists would be barred from traveling to the republic.
There was no mention of foreign journalists already in Lithuania,
meaning no news blackout was imposed.
   In Washington, President Bush's national security adviser, Brent
Scowcroft, warned that any Soviet use of force or intimidation in
Lithuania ``would be counterproductive'' to U.S.-Soviet relations.
   About 100 Soviet military vehicles containing at least 1,000
paratroopers armed with automatic weapons rumbled along the main
highway through the heart of Vilnius without stopping early
Saturday, official Lithuanian sources said.
   There were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers and
dozens of green military trucks. The parliament's information
department quoted witnesses as saying there were 59 tanks and 50
other vehicles. No incidents were reported.
   The convoy passed within about 100 yards of Lithuania's
parliament building. Lawmakers called the maneuvers another Soviet
attempt to rattle their nerves in the so-far peaceful campaign for
independence.
   Since Lithuania declared independence from Moscow on March 11,
Soviet leaders have repeatedly warned the republic to return to the
Soviet Union. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called the move
illegal but said he would not use force against the republic of 3.8
million people.
   In referring to Saturday's maneuver, Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis told the Supreme Council legislature: ``We
felt we were really in an occupied country. An alien power sent
forces and we don't know why.
   ``Tension is rising with this demonstration of military force,
with this frightening of people with Soviet soldiers.''
   At a Saturday night news conference, deputy Prime Minister
Kazimieras Motieka warned that political officers in the Soviet
military were telling soldiers they may have to act to prevent a
coup d'etat. He charged they were trying to prepare troops for
attacking the democratically elected government of Lithuania.
   In Tokyo, Leonid Kravchenko, head of the official Soviet news
agency Tass, said a state of emergency may be declared. He did not
elaborate, but such a declaration by Gorbachev would give the newly
strengthened president greater authority to reassert Soviet power
in Lithuania.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers passed a resolution that would transfer
power to the senior diplomat of independent Lithuania in Washington
in case the Soviets prevent them from freely conducting government
business.
   Lithuania, along with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia,
enjoyed independence between the two world wars but was forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as part of a secret Nazi-Soviet
pact.
   Vilnius was quiet Saturday after the military column rumbled
through at 4 a.m., a time apparently calculated to avoid
confrontations. A parliament spokesman said he saw the column enter
a military base at Siaures Miestelis on the north side of the
capital, where it stayed.
   ``We're not afraid, but we don't know what they want, and we
don't know what they will do in the next few hours,'' Lithuanian
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene told reporters at the
legislature.
   Many Lithuanians shrugged off the latest show of Soviet force.
``We were prepared, and the marching of tanks is nothing for us,''
said Arune Taunyte, a graphics designer.
   ``We were afraid for 50 years _ but not now,'' said Rimas
Cequolis, a 56-year-old violinist.
   There were no reports of Soviet authorities moving in Saturday
to arrest the estimated 900 deserters from the Soviet military,
Gorbachev's deadline for their voluntary return to their posts.
   ``We cannot physically protect each young man where he is
hiding,'' Landsbergis told the parliament. He suggested the young
men avoid the homes of acquaintances and instead seek sanctuary in
churches, a traditional shelter for fugitives.
   At least 28 deserters took refuge in a shelter organized by the
Lithuanian government at the New Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital
dormitory.
   ``We expect that nobody would dare to attack the Red Cross,''
said one of deserter there, 20-year-old Darius Baceulis.
   If troops do come after them, 19-year-old Arunas Vazinskas said,
life would still ``be better in prison than in the army.''
   Many deserters have complained they were beaten or harassed by
comrades angry about their republic's drive for independence.
   Gorbachev has also demanded that Lithuania stop signing up
volunteer forces and had sought a response from Landsbergis by
Saturday.
   Landsbergis, in a telegram to Moscow on Saturday, said the
volunteers would not replace Soviet KGB border guards and uniformed
police, as Gorbachev had suggested.
   ``Vremya,'' a Soviet news program, said Saturday night that
Interior Ministry authorities have seized 5,500 weapons in
Lithuania. Gorbachev had demanded Lithuanians turn in their
firearms.
   The seized weapons included 873 guns that military auxiliary
units in Kaunus refused to surrender voluntarily, the Soviet
program said. ``Only the intervention of military units'' enabled
authorities to confiscate the weapons and 516,000 rounds of
ammunition, it said. There was no indication of violence in the
arms seizure.
   Romas Gudaitis, a Lithuanian representative to the national
parliament in Moscow, said Soviet authorities had rejected a
Lithuanian request for negotiations.

   Romania appealed to Hungary on
Saturday to avoid exacerbating ethnic tension in Transylvania,
where clashes between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians have killed
at least seven people.
   Premier Petre Roman of Romania made the plea during a 90-minute
meeting with Hungary's ambassador, Pal Szuts.
   ``We hope the Hungarian government will help us and not make the
situation there more difficult by pronouncements which give the
Romanians in Transylvania the feeling they are in danger,'' a
government statement obtained by The Associated Press quoted Roman
as saying.
   The Hungarian envoy had asked for the meeting because of
mounting tension between the two Warsaw Pact allies over the rights
of the 2 million-strong minority of ethnic Hungarians in
Transylvania. In addition to the seven deaths, about 300 people
have been wounded in the clashes over the past week in the town of
Tirgu Mures.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu of Romania also appealed for calm.
He rejected complaints that his government had not acted firmly
enough to prevent violence. He said democratic methods are needed
to solve ethnic conflicts.
   Romanians in Transylvania fear that a campaign by ethnic
Hungarians for education in their own language is a veiled push for
autonomy or even union with Hungary. Hungarians deny those
assertions.
   Hungary ruled Transylvania for hundreds of years before 1920,
when the victorious allied powers of World War I transferred it to
Romania in return for help during the war.
   Romania and Hungary traded recriminations this week after the
clashes in Tirgu Mures.
   The picturesque town about 160 miles north of Bucharest was
reported calm Saturday. The daily Adevarul said members of both
ethnic groups planned to demonstrate together Sunday to show they
could cooperate.
   About 400 people gathered around the city hall building, where
officials of Romania's post-revolutionary government met with
representatives of the two communities to defuse the crisis.
   A cordon of tanks and troops kept the crowd clear of the
building, as the demonstrators chanted, ``Down with Iliescu!'' They
blame Iliescu, who took over leadership in December after the
ouster of Communist dicatator Nicolae Ceausescu, for not doing
enough to prevent ethnic strife.
   Late Thursday, the two sides approved a new county and municipal
leadership composed of 13 Romanians and eight ethnic Hungarians.
   In a related development, press reports said Saturday that the
Russian minority in the eastern province of Dobrogea was demanding
that instruction in regional schools be in Russian.
   Ethnic Russians, who number about 100,000 and refer to
themselves as ``Lipoveni,'' also want a seminary for Russian
Orthodox priests and free travel to the Soviet Union, the Libera
daily said.

<TEXT>
   Police anti-terrorist units patrolled Lima's
streets Saturday after a wave of pre-election violence by leftist
guerrillas prompted the government to declare a state of emergency
in the capital.
   Also Saturday, Shining Path rebels briefly took over a Lima
radio station and broadcast a recorded message urging people to
boycott the elections and announcing plans for an ``armed strike''
on Wednesday. The term refers to a general strike and implies
violence against people who don't participate.
   Political leaders condemned the recent assassinations of
congressional candidates, and a governing party senator called on
candidates to arm themselves because the government can't protect
them.
   The increase in rebel violence comes two weeks before elections
April 8 to pick a new president, senate and congress and elect
members of new regional assemblies.
   A candidate for the governing, center-left Aprista party was
shot to death at his home Thursday in Huancayo, 120 miles east of
Lima in the Andes Mountains.
   In Lima Friday, Shining Path guerrillas gunned down a candidate
for congress for the center-right Fredemo coalition led by writer
and presidential front-runner Mario Vargas Llosa.
   A car bomb blew up in front of the economy ministry on a crowded
downtown Lima street Friday night, killing a man and an 8-year-old
boy, and wounding 12 people. Police blamed the Shining Path.
   On Saturday morning two dynamite bombs were thrown at the Lima
home of Demetri Cisneros, candidate for Senate for a small, leftist
party, according to police, who blamed the guerrillas. Cisneros was
not injured but the bombs destroyed his car and damaged part of his
house.
   Sen. Andres Quintana, a member of President Alan Garcia's
populist Aprista party, said candidates should arm themselves
against terrorist attacks because the government does not have
enough police to provide security for all 5,000 people running for
office.
   Quoted Saturday in the Lima newspaper Pagina Libre, Quintana
said: ``I'm terribly disturbed by the (assassinations), but
security is everybody's job, not just the police.''
   The 30-day state of emergency was declared Friday in Lima and
the nearby port of Callao. It revives a similar decree that expired
Jan. 5.
   About a third of the country is under emergency status, mostly
in the central Andean highlands and the northeastern jungle where
the guerrillas are most active.
   The government has used state of emergency decrees to combat
terrorism since 1982. Among restrictions implied in the decree are
suspension of the right to free movement and assembly and
guarantees against search and seizure.
   Lima police Chief Gen. Oswaldo Diaz said Saturday the suspension
of rights to free assembly would not affect campaign rallies
scheduled for the last two weeks of the campaign.
   The Shining Path began fighting Peru's elected governments 10
years ago, launching its first attack in the mountains near
Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima.
   The group now operates throughout the Andean highlands and in
the northeastern jungles, where authorities say it earns money from
the illegal drug trade.
   A radical, dogmatic group, the Shining Path seeks to replace
Peru's government with a worker-peasant state styled on the ideas
of Mao Tse-tung.
   The rebels waged a bloody campaign of terror prior to November's
nationwide municipal elections, killing more than 150 local
government officials and candidates.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
decade of political violence, including police, soldiers, rebels,
government officials and civilians.

   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki hailed
the beginning of a new era in U.S.-Polish relations Saturday during
a visit to drum up support in the city with the largest Polish
community outside Warsaw.
   Mazowiecki told a crowd of about 800 at the State of Illinois
Building that Polish-Americans have a great role to play in
building ``understanding and cooperation'' between the United
States and Poland.
   ``We have come to America to open up a new chapter in the
relationship between the United States and Poland,'' Mazowiecki
said, speaking through an interpreter.
   Mazowiecki, making a three-day visit to Chicago, was greeted
with traditional Polish dances and songs. Many in the crowd waved
U.S. and Polish flags.
   ``Lots of people like us, people who emigrated to this country,
are trying to help the country any way we can,'' said Harriet
Nowacki, a member of the Polish-American chorus that sang several
songs for Mazowiecki. ``We try to show that we are also Polish and
we share our feelings with them and we are patriots of the country,
even though we live in a foreign land.''
   Earlier, Mazowiecki said at a news conference that Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa's November visit to the United States, including
a stop in Chicago, was ``important and triumphant.''
   Mazowiecki, a former adviser to Walesa who heads a
Solidarity-led government, said he was here to follow up on
promises of economic aid from the U.S. government and investment by
U.S. businesses offered during Walesa's visit.
   ``I have not come to the United States to ask for more help,''
Mazowiecki said, speaking through an interpreter. ``I have come

   Mazowiecki's visit to Chicago, with its estimated 800,000 to 1
million Polish-Americans, was seen as a key stop on his six-day
trip to the United States. He arrived from Washington on Friday and
was scheduled to leave for New York on Sunday.
   The prime minister's visit included meetings with business and
civic leaders aimed at encouraging U.S. investment in Poland's
struggling economy.
   Mazowiecki made a plea for investment Friday at a private dinner
in the downtown Mid America Club.
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, U.S. Sen. Paul Simon, Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin and executives from Amoco Oil Co., Motorola Inc. and
other corporations were among those who attended.
   Mazowiecki, 62, a former Solidarity editor and political
prisoner who in August became the leader of the first non-Communist
government in Eastern Europe in more than 40 years, was honored
Saturday morning during a convocation at DePaul University.

   Indian tribes from the United States and
Canada gathered Saturday to sign a first-ever intertribal treaty
rallying them to protect tribal rights and preserve their treaties
with the government.
   The document was drafted in response to fears that federal,
state and local governments intend to disregard their rights as
sovereign nations and undermine treaties which grant the tribes
land, hunting rights and sovereign jurisdiction.
   Representatives of 20 Indian nations or tribes, many wearing
traditional tribal headdresses, signed the Indigenous Nations
Treaty during a two-hour outdoor ceremony. Each briefly grasped a
prayer staff before putting pen to paper.
   Afterwards, a ceremonial peace pipe brought by the Sioux Nation
was passed to the beat of tom-toms and prayer songs.
   The document promises tribes will set aside differences and come
to the defense of more than 400 treaties signed between the U.S.
government and Indian tribes or nations over the past 200 years.
   Luke Duncan, chairman of Utah's Ute Tribe, said the peace pipe
ceremony makes the document sacred.
   ``This is an important day,'' said Wendel Chino, chairman of the
Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico, who said past treaties
deserve the same consideration as the U.S. Constitution or the Bill
of Rights.
   ``We alone know what it means when the drums beat,'' he said.
``That is why we must rally around our treaties ... Let us say no
to the subtle attempts to modify them.''
   The ceremony took place the same day the Puyallup Tribe in
Tacoma, Wash., signed away its claim to a valuable chunk of
industrial land in a settlement that will give the tribe $162
million in cash, education and job assistance and improvements to
the land the tribe retains.
   At the Utah gathering, tribal leaders said they hope their
alliance will lead to a summit with President Bush where concerns
over federal encroachment into tribal sovereignty could be
discussed.
   ``Today we remember the deaths of our chiefs, our warriors, our
women and children,'' said Glen Miller, vice-chairman of the
Menominee tribe of Wisconsin. He was one of several speakers in a
morning session held following a flag ceremony and prayer songs.
   ``Today we remember the price they paid for our reservations,''
he said. ``Our chiefs negotiated for peace and they were killed.
Our women ran with their children and were killed.
   ``We must soothe their bones, revive their spirits and save
their nation.''
   It was the second gathering in a month as tribal officials
attempt to focus attention on the issue.
   Indian leaders met in South Dakota last month to discuss
strategy after a controversial gathering in Salt Lake City last
January by local government officials _ meeting as part of the
National Coalition on Federal Indian Policy _ worried about tribal
influences.
   That meeting was sponsored by the Wisconsin Association of
Counties.
   The Menominee tribe of Wisconsin is battling the county
association over timber and fishing rights.
   ``There are things happening that make my heart feel heavy,''
said Paul Iron Cloud, former president of the Oglala Sioux from the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
   ``I feel that for the survival of our people we are going to
have to come together,'' Iron Cloud said. ``It is a very historical
event.''
   Duncan was critical of a Utah legislative task force set up to
look into allegations that non-Indians living on the Ute-Ouray
Reservation in Uintah and Duchesne counties are the victims of
civil rights violations. Non-Indians also complain about a sliding
10 percent tribal severance tax on oil and gas taken from Indian
lands.
   ``Non-Indians who live on our lands need to recognize our laws,
just like we recognize theirs when we leave the reservation,'' he
said. ``We are fighting for a way of life. All we're asking is to
leave our treaties alone.''
   ``The sovereignty of tribal nations has been under attack since
1492,'' said Roger A. Jourdain, chairman of the Red Lake, Minn.,
Chippewa Tribe.

   The Puyallup Tribe signed away its claim to
much of its traditional land Saturday in exchange for cash,
promises of jobs and education and a chunk of Tacoma's industrial
waterfront.
   ``This is one of the most important events in our tribe's
history,'' said tribe Chairman Henry John at a packed downtown
ceremony.
   John said he did not expect the $162 million land claims
settlement to solve all problems that have divided the Indian and
white communities over the past century. But he said it gives a
framework for resolving future disagreements.
   Under the agreement, the second-largest native land settlement
in U.S. history, the Puyallups are abandoning their claim to 20,000
acres at the mouth of the Puyallup River. The land now forms the
Port of Tacoma and most of the city's industrial land.
   It once was part of the tribe's reservation, but most was lost
to white settlers in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
   In return, the tribe will receive a package that includes 900
acres, up to $20,000 cash for each of the tribe's 1,500 members,
and trusts that promise a future of jobs, education and security.
The only bigger native land settlement in the United States was the
Alaska Native Claims Act.
   The signing ceremony, which included speeches by dignitaries and
colorfully costumed dancers performing to tribal drums, took place
after the tribe's attorneys appeared in U.S. District Court an hour
earlier to ask for dismissal of a land-claims lawsuit filed in the
early 1980s.
   John Bell, attorney for the tribe, told U.S. Judge John
Coughenour that of all the features in the agreement approved by
tribe members in 1988, the most important was the tribe's
recognition by the larger community.
   ``The tribe and its rights have gained a measure of respect,''
he said.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, said that while many of the injustices
against Indians will never be undone, the Puyallup agreement is a
model for settling similar disputes.
   ``People in Tacoma have demonstrated there is an alternative''
to endless court battles over tribal claims, he said.
   Inouye, who made a dozen visits to Tacoma to help in
negotiations, said he was approached by Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.,
in 1987 to help resolve the dispute, after a 1986 tribal vote
rejected a proposed settlement. He said he found bitterness on both
sides, but felt it was an opportunity to show negotiation could
work.
   ``Both sides would have to put their necks on the line,'' he
said.
   While some tribal members will undoubtedly squander their share
of the payoff, the majority will act responsibly ``because they
know their brothers and sisters in Indian country will be
watching,'' Inouye said.
   Dicks said the cooperation built into the agreement benefits not
only the tribe but also landholders in Tacoma bypassed by
development because Indian claims clouded land titles.
   ``The terms of this settlement will make the Puyallup tribe a
major economic force in our community,'' he said.
   Eight to ten Indian protesters appeared outside the courthouse
and the downtown hotel where the signing ceremony took place, with
signs that read, ``Poor, Still Poor,'' ``Puyallup Tribe Never Gave
Us Nothing,'' and ``No Delays, Pay Today.''
   The protesters said they feared they would not get their
individual payments. The tribe has said it will probably be at
least 60 days before the payments are made.
   Of the $162 million, $51 million goes for dredging Blair
Waterway on the industrial waterfront and improving roads in the
area, including some that lead to 240 waterfront acres deeded to
the tribe.
   Other major elements of the settlement include:
   _$24 million to provide the one-time payments to tribe members.
   _$22 million in a permanent trust fund for social, health and
welfare needs of the tribe.
   _$37 million as total value of the 900 acres the tribe will
receive.
   _$3.5 million for job training for 265 Puyallups and jobs
promised for 115 tribe members in Pierce County private-sector
businesses.
   _$11.5 million for economic development.
   _$10 million for fisheries enhancement.
   Contributors to the settlement include the federal government,
Washington state, private businesses and nearby municipalities.

   Coast Guard investigators on Saturday
interviewed some of the 22 survivors of a fishing boat that sank in
good weather in the icy Bering Sea. Nine of the crew are missing
and presumed lost.
   The survivors remained in the Aleutian Island port of Dutch
Harbor on Saturday because of poor flying weather.
   The 162-foot, 195-ton Aleutian Enterprise sank Thursday near the
Pribilof Islands, about 250 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor.
   The survivors were exhausted and terribly shaken, said one Dutch
Harbor resident who saw them Saturday.
   `They've been through hell. They're doing O.K. They are trying
to maintain,'' said Marie, an employee of the Unisea Inn where some
of the crewmen spent the night Friday. She refused to give her last
name.
   Survivors arrived in Dutch Harbor, 800 miles south of Anchorage,
on Friday aboard the Bering Enterprise, a sister ship of the one
that went down, said Coast Guard spokesman Greg Robinson.
   A Coast Guard investigator from Anchorage began interviewing
some of the crewmen as soon as they arrived in Dutch Harbor, he
said.
   Informal interviews with the crew will continue through the
weekend, said Robinson, and Marine Board of Investigation Chairman
Rene Roussel, a Coast Guard captain from Seattle, will determine
where and when a formal hearing is held to determine the cause of
the sinking.
   The cod fishing and processing factory trawler was owned by
Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corp. of Seattle. The company operates 21
fishing vessels in the North Pacific ranging in length from 115
feet to 335 feet.

   Police stopped a rental truck Saturday and
learned it was carrying 38 illegal aliens who had left Mexico three
days earlier.
   The men were all sent back to Mexico by airplane.
   An investigation was under way to determine why the Mexicans
were in northeast Ohio, said Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service
official Robert Brown.
   ``We are going to pursue some of the leads we have and
ultimately we will catch the people who brought them here,'' Brown
said.
   Chardon police reported Saturday that a resident complained
early in the morning about a rental truck seen in the village and
men acting suspiciously.
   When police located the truck and interviewed the driver, they
learned it was carrying 38 males, all illegal aliens from Mexico.
The INS was contacted and took the Mexicans to INS officies in
Cleveland.
   According to the INS, the Mexicans began their journey Wednesday
from the vicinity of Tijuana, and they carried counterfeit Social
Security and green cards, issued by the INS as documentation of an
alien's permanent and legal U.S. residency.
   The INS said the cost of sending them back was about $11,000.

   A tour bus returning to Massachusetts after
a trip to a musical show in New York City overturned Saturday on
Interstate 684, killing two people and injuring 32, officials said.
   The bus, chartered by the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Cambridge, Mass., was involved in an accident with two
cars, said state police Trooper Alen Fox.
   It was not immediately clear if the two who were killed had been
on the bus or in the cars, Fox said.
   Several injured passengers told Nancy Kaufmann, an administrator
at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, that the bus
overturned when it swerved to avoid a car that had jumped the
median, Ms. Kaufmann said.
   The passengers told her they had been to see ``Mama, I Want To
Sing,'' at the Heckshear Theater in Harlem.
   Fifty people were on the annual excursion, said the Rev. Richard
Richardson of the St. Paul A.M.E. Church.

   An Asian-American group demanded

mayor.
   ``Please avoid any further embarrassment by throwing in the

Florida said in a letter to Cox on Friday. ``Your racist, bigoted
remarks show how deep-rooted your discrimination is.''
   After making the remark to a fourth-grade class at Edgewood
Elementary School in February, Cox amended it by saying that being
white is no longer required. The comment was publicized last week.
   ``I apologized for it a second after I said it,'' Cox said
Friday. ``I said it's not like that any more, and it's a good

   Roosevelt Walters, president of the National Association for the

   They feathered an oil-man effigy
Saturday in Alaska's largest city and listened to ecology folk
music in the fishing town of Homer.
   In Cordova, fishermen whose livelihood was threatened by the
nation's worst oil spill put the first anniversary of the Exxon
Valdez disaster behind them with a community breakfast of sourdough
waffles.
   Women in Kodiak chose March 24 as a time to move on, to turn
their oil spill support group into a political pressure group
targeting federal and state spill bills.
   A small flotilla of boats motored back and forth near the Exxon
Valdez during a demonstration in San Diego Bay, where the
now-unnamed tanker is undergoing repairs. Protest banners were
unfurled from the masts of sailboats in, and even a kayak was
mounted with the sign: ``No drilling No spilling''
   And in Valdez, symbolic ground zero, officials braced for the
return of anti-oil activists.
   As Saturday afternoon wore on, the expected protest regatta of
fishing vessels failed to materialize at the Port of Valdez, where
the giant Exxon tanker took on a load of Alaska crude that later
poured into Prince William Sound.
   Mayor Lynn Chrystal said his town was quiet.
   ``Most of us are trying to put it behind us,'' Chrystal said.
``We don't want to forget the spill, but we do want to learn from
it and move on.''
   The observances came a day after Joseph Hazelwood, the ship's
captain, was sentenced to 1,000 hours of helping clean up some of
the 11,000 gallons of oil that gushed out when the tanker grounded
on Bligh Reef. The fired skipper _ convicted of the misdemeanor of
negligent discharge of oil but acquitted of a felony and other
misdemeanors _ also was ordered to pay $50,000 restitution.
   In Cordova, a fishing town whose residents were hurt
economically by the spill, anger has faded somewhat.
   ``We wanted to do something healing,'' said Michelle O'Leary of
Cordova District Fishermen United. ``With all the stress of the
one-year anniversary, between all the media and then trying to get
ready for the fishing season, we decided to have this sourdough
breakfast, to do something just for us.''
   In Homer, another fishing town, a pot-luck gathering was
serenaded by folk singers who take ecological themes. A Kodiak
group called the Crude Women met to plan strategy for legislative
lobbying.
   In Anchorage, demonstrators chalked images of sea creatures on
the median in front of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the company
that operates the oil pipeline that fed the Exxon Valdez. They
waved a huge Alaska state flag, reviled the oil-man mannequin and
set out a bucket of congealed goo beneath a sign that said:
``Genuine Prince William Sound crude oil. Help yourself if it's for
a good cause.''

   Thousands marched in front of the White House
on Saturday to protest U.S. policies in Central America and mark
the tenth anniversary of the assassination of a noted Salvadoran
priest.
   Park Police estimated 10,000 people joined the demonstation.
Police spokesman Sgt. J.P. Farrell said 83 protesters were arrested
and charged with demonstrating without a permit.
   The group marched peacefully, waved banners and called for a
halt to U.S. military aid to El Salvador as a light, steady snow
fell.
   The march commemorated the assasination 10 years ago of
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero who was gunned down in the pulpit
of the Salvadoran church where he frequently criticized right-wing
death squads linked with the country's military.
   The marchers carried a huge bust of Romero and quoted from his
speeches over a loudspeaker across the street from the White House.
   Meanwhile, in San Francisco, an estimated 5,000 people marched
in a chilly fog from Jefferson Square Park to the plaza in front of
City Hall.
   Protesters there carried signs remembering Romero, but many
others advocated a nuclear freeze, saving the environment or ending
the death penalty.
   Scott Harding, a member of the San Francisco Committee in
Solidarity With the People of El Salvador, said the many causes
expressed were appropriate on the anniversary of Romero's death.
   ``He was a very outspoken proponent of the need for peace. And
he addressed the same causes of the war in El Salvador _ poverty
and oppression,'' Harding said.
   Though evidence implicating extreme rightists' involvement in
the assassination was compiled by the 1984-89 Christian Democratic
government, no one was charged in the murder.
   ``Stop the bombing, stop the war. U.S. out of El Salvador,'' the
protesters in Washington chanted as some of their number blocked
the White House gates and were arrested.
   Some lay on the icy ground as riot-equipped police calmly picked
them up and deposited them in paddy wagons.
   ``Arrest George Bush. Arrest Dan Quayle,'' the protesters
chanted. Bush, who was spending the weekend at the presidential
retreat in Camp David, Md., was not in the White House.
   Vice President Dan Quayle was traveling on a vacation with his
family in Hawaii.
   ``Tacos not Tanks,'' read one giant banner carried by the
demonstrators.
   Another read, ``Mao more than ever.''
   Among the participants were actor Ed Asner, long active in
Central America demonstrations, and Jennifer Casolo, the American
churchwoman was arrested last year by the Salvadoran government.
   Casolo was accused of aiding left-wing guerrillas and arrested
after a cache of weapons was found buried in her backyard. She
denied knowing anythng about the arms but was expelled to the
United States.
   Police barred traffic from passage in front of the White House
and lined Pennsylvania Avenue as they stood quietly watching the
demonstrators.

   Schwammberger has lived under his own name in Argentina since
1949. He obtained citizenship in 1965 and has been jailed since his

<TEXT>
   The administration's 1990 farm bill proposal
for food aid to needy countries has been sent to Congress,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Friday.
   ``The United States has a long history of generous food aid and
we intend to have that tradition continue,'' Yeutter said.
   Three food aid programs are most likely to be considered during
the farm bill debate, he said. Those include the Food for Peace, or
P.L. 480, program, which provides up to 8 million metric tons of
commodities to developing countries each year.
   Others are the Food for Progress program, which authorizes both
credit sales and donations to help developing countries establish
private-sector economies, and ``Section 416(b)'' which authorizes
additional donations of surplus commodities owned by the
Agriculture Department.
   Yeutter said the proposals include a change in Food for Peace
Title I operations to allow direct grants at the discretion of the
president for countries that meet the poverty criteria established
by the World Bank for Civil Works Preference, currently those with
per capita incomes of $545 a year or less.
   This would permit greater participation in food-aid grant
programs by the poor countries, particularly by the impoverished
sub-Saharan African nations, he said.
   As it is now, Title I of Food for Peace authorizes long-term
credit sales but includes no grant authority.
   Also, Yeutter said multiyear agreements with Food for Peace
countries should be standardized. Currently, various sections of
the program have ``inconsistent authorities'' for multiyear
agreements.

   Two F-16A jet fighters crashed while on a
night training mission, in the third incident involving Hill Air
Force Base jet fighters in one week.
   Both Air Force Reserve pilots ejected safely after the accident
Thursday 30 miles southeast of Wendover in northwest Utah, said
spokeswoman Barbara Ann Vessels.
   Major Tom Ward, 37, of Layton and Capt. Ron Zimmerman, 36, of
Bountiful were taken by helicopter to the Hill Air Force Base
hospital and were in good condition Friday with no serious
injuries, she said.
   The single-seat planes from the 419th Tactical Fighter Wing, a
Reserve unit at Hill, were on a night refueling and air-intercept
training mission when the crash occurred on the military's Wendover
Range, she said.
   Vessels could not say whether the planes crashed because of a
collision. Col. Glen Jepsen on Friday would neither confirm nor
deny that the planes collided.
   The Tooele County Sheriff's Office said the site was remote and
no officers were sent.
   An F-16A crashed four miles northeast of Wendover March 16. The
pilot ejected after the plane's engine failed, the Federal Aviation
Administration said. The Air Force said the plane had undergone
maintenance at Hill and was on a test flight. It would not comment
on the cause of the crash.
   About 10 minutes after the F-16A crash, a newer model F-16C made
an emergency landing at Wendover, near the Nevada border, after
catching fire. Col. Charles R. Heflebower, commander of Hill's
388th Tactical Fighter Wing, said this week that mechanics would
try to fix the plane at Wendover.
   The 388th is about two-thirds complete in converting its 74
planes from the older A and B models to the newer C and D models.

President Mikhail Gorbachev, his office said Friday.
   Kennedy also hopes to make an address on Soviet television as
well as see members of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament.
He will be in Moscow from March 25-March 28.
   ``This is obviously a time of great change and great challenge
for the Soviet Union and for U.S.-Soviet relations,'' Kennedy said.
``I look forward to these meetings and to the opportunity in the
coming weeks to work closely with Congress and the administration
in formulating policies.''
   The visit will be Kennedy's fourth to the Soviet Union. His most
recent visit occurred in 1986 when he also met with Gorbachev.

   A multimillion-dollar gift from the
Eastman School of Music's first graduate has pushed the school to
the halfway mark in its fund-raising efforts, University of
Rochester officials said.
   Eastman School Director Robert Freeman said the gift from Roslyn
Weisberg Cominsky is ``by far the largest gift'' in the school's
$15 million fund-raising campaign. He would not say how much
Cominsky gave the school.
   Cominsky, who lives in New York, was the only member of the
class of 1922, the music school's first graduating class.
   A Syracuse native, Cominsky came to the Eastman School in 1921
as a senior majoring in piano and graduated the following year.
   During her career as a pianist she performed with the Cincinnati
Symphony, the Rochester Philharmonic and the Milwaukee Symphony.
She was a three-time winner of a Juilliard Fellowship from the
prestigious New York school.
   She was a member of the Metropolitan Opera National Council and
the Women's Auxiliary board of the New York Philharmonic.
   The money will help fund the construction of a new dormitory,
part of which will be named after Cominsky, and the purchase of
Eastman Place, which houses the Sibley Music Library.
   Cominsky's late husband, Jacob Robert Cominsky, was publisher of
the Saturday Review from 1942 until his retirement in 1968.

   Chile and Mexico renewed diplomatic
relations Friday, more than 15 years after they were broken in
protest over the violent military coup that ousted elected
President Salvador Allende.
   A ceremony marking the restoration of diplomatic ties was
attended by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his
Chilean counterpart Patricio Aylwin.
   Mexico severed relations with Chile in November 1974 in protest
over the coup the previous year led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The
right-wing army commander gave up power 12 days ago and was
suceeded by Aylwin, an elected civilian politician.
   Gortari is scheduled to leave Saturday for Ecuador.
   In a brief speech, Aylwin thanked ``the Mexican government and
people for its solidarity with thousands of Chilean exiles'' who
lived in Mexico during Pinochet's rule.

<HEAD>INS Considering Concrete Posts on Border To Deter Illegal
Immigration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering installation of
concrete posts along heavily traveled sections of the U.S.-Mexico
border to deter illegal crossings and drug trafficking, officials
said Friday.
   Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said Commissioner Gene McNary was considering the concrete
barriers in areas where there is heavy drive-through traffic, such
as around ports of entry.
   ``We have no final details,'' Jervis said. ``It's just something
we're considering at this point.''
   Jervis said it was not known how many miles of the
2,000-mile-long border would be affected or how much the plan would
cost. He described the posts as similar to those in front of the
White House.
   McNary, who took over as INS commissioner late last year, helped
shelve a controversial proposal by his predecessor, Alan Nelson, to
dig a 4-mile drainage ditch in Southern California to discourage
illegal border crossings from Mexico.
   McNary said then that he wanted to secure the border ``in a
humane way'' and that repairing fences might be an alternative.
   He disclosed the idea for the concrete posts at a hearing of the
House Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce, State, Justice and
the judiciary on Wednesday. He said the barriers could be used to
deter drug trafficking and to mark sections of the border.
   The drainage ditch proposal was opposed by hispanic
organizations and the Mexican government. Opponents on both sides
of the border likened it to the Berlin Wall, and several Mexican
congressmen called it an unfriendly gesture.
   The Border Patrol had contended that the ditch, 8 feet deep and
14 feet wide, would make it harder for drivers to smuggle drugs and
for illegal aliens to cross the desert near San Diego.
   McNary's comments on securing the border with concrete posts
come as illegal immigration along the southwestern border has begun
to climb again after a three-year decline.
   According to INS figures, apprehensions of illegal aliens _
considered the best indicator of illegal immigration _ were up in
each of the past 10 months, compared with the same months a year
ago.
   Jervis said the surge in arrests began in May 1989 and has
continued through at least February. During the 10-month period,
apprehensions totaled 801,937. That represented a 29.9 percent
increase from 617,317 apprehensions during the same period a year
ago.
   Apprehensions of illegal aliens began falling off in fiscal
1987, the first year after Congress passed the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986, which made employers subject to criminal
and civil sanctions for knowingly hiring undocumented workers.

   The Department of Health and Human Services on
Friday proposed new regulations putting the burden on the states to
ensure that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get appropriate
care in nursing homes.
   The proposal would implement a law passed by Congress in 1987
requiring states to set up programs to screen nursing home
applicants and find more appropriate placements for mentally ill
and mentally retarded applicants who do not need nursing facility
care.
   Another proposed regulation would require nursing homes to meet
new training and competency standards for nurse aides.
   The screening requirement took effect Jan. 1, 1989, although no
regulations were in place. The Health Care Financing Administration
notified state Medicaid directors at the time that compliance was
required, and provided preliminary guidance to the states.
   Failure of a nursing home to meet the terms of the screening
requirement could result in its termination from the Medicaid
program.
   The proposed rule outlines the specific details of the
preadmission screening programs and requires an annual review of
current nursing home residents with mental illness and retardation.
   In the annual reviews, nursing homes are to identify mentally
ill and retarded patients who need active treatment for those
conditions.
   If a patient requires active treatment and has been in a nursing
home less than 30 months and doesn't need nursing facility care,
the state must arrange for active treatment of the patient in a
setting that more appropriately meets his needs.
   Nursing home residents who have been in a home for more than 30
months but do not need nursing care may opt to stay there, and the
state must provide or arrange for active treatment, under the rule.
   Nursing homes have been concerned about the screening
requirement, and many said last year that mentally ill and retarded
patients would be turned out of nursing homes into the streets.
   Linda Keegan, a spokeswoman for the American Health Care
Association, said that ``we didn't see a lot of problems with the
preadmission screening, but we don't know to what extent that was
because of the flexibility states have had'' because detailed
regulations aren't yet in place.
   Under the proposal concerning training of nurse aides, states
must establish registries of nurse aides who meet training and
competency requirements, including any findings that a nurse aide
has abused or neglected patients or stolen property.
   Both sets of rules were published in the Federal Register and
each will have a 60-day comment period before final rules are
issued.

   The Energy Department plans to restart a
Savannah River nuclear weapons reactor this year without bringing
it into compliance with the nation's main water pollution law, two
environmental groups said Friday.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy Research
Foundation, which contend the reactor is not needed, made the
allegation in a letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
   The groups notified the department that they would sue if
Watkins carried out his plan to restart the ``K'' reactor at
Savannah River before completing work on a cooling tower. The
tower, scheduled for completion in 1992, would bring the facility
into compliance with the federal Water Pollution Control Act of
1972.
   Catherine Kaliniak, a department spokeswoman, said DOE was in
compliance with the Clean Water Act under a consent order issued by
South Carolina.
   ``During the construction of the cooling tower, `K' reactor can
be restarted and operated under the consent order issued by the
state,'' she said.
   The Savannah River production site near Aiken, S.C., along the
banks of the Savannah River, is the nation's only source of
tritium, a gas needed in nuclear warheads. All three reactors there
have been closed for nearly two years for safety reasons.
   Watkins recently said he expected the ``K'' reactor to be back
in production by the end of this year, although he cautioned that
the timing is not firm. The two other reactors, to be restarted in
1991, circulate their heated water through man-made lakes before it
reaches the river system.
   The environmental groups contend that untreated water from the
``K'' reactor, at temperatures of up to 180 degrees, interferes
with fish migration and causes other environmental damage. The
reactor began operating in 1954.
   ``Without the cooling tower, this reactor will dump scalding
water directly into natural streams and damage valuable wetlands,''
said Frances Hart, chairwoman of the Energy Research Foundation, a
public interest group in Columbia, S.C.
   In their letter to Watkins, the environmental groups said the
Water Pollution Control Act provides an alternative to building the
cooling tower. It says the president may exempt any federal
facility from the law if he believes it is necessary to protect
paramount national interests.
   President Bush has made no such determination.
   Dan Reicher, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said such an exemption would be inappropriate because two
other reactors at Savannah River could be restarted to meet the
tritium requirements without violating the water pollution law.

   President Bush said Friday that the Star Wars
program ``makes much more sense than ever before.''
   Bush, marking the seventh anniversary of the start of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, said SDI offers an opportunity to
shift to ``a safer and more stable basis through greater reliance
on strategic defenses.''
   ``Morever, in a new international environment, as
ballistic-missile capabilities proliferate, defense against
third-country threats also becomes an increasingly important
benefit,'' the president said in a statement.
   The program, he said, also could protect U.S. security against
possible violations of agreements to reduce strategic arms.
   ``In the 1990s, strategic defenses make much more sense than
ever before,'' Bush said.

   A Hollywood studio representative and NBC-TV
exchanged verbal brickbats Friday over a network program dealing
with a ``new'' Hollywood where small producers are likely to get
sqashed by large _ sometimes foreign _ conglomerates.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he was outraged over NBC's ``The New Hollywood,''
broadcast Wednesday night.
   Valenti said NBC criticized the Hollywood trend toward
conglomerates pushing out the little guys, and international
ownership and investment, but failed to disclose NBC's efforts in
Washington to wrest back control of its programs from Hollywood
producers.
   Tom Brokaw, who anchored the program, called Valenti's attack an
insult to his journalistic integrity.
   Valenti, in a letter to NBC President Robert Wright, demanded a
opportunity, in television prime time, to ``present a rebuttal to
NBC's lack of disclosure.''
   NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge said Valenti's demand was ``idiotic.
That means no.''
   Hollywood producers, including the major studios that make up
the MPAA, have been involved in often-acrimonious negotiations for
seven years over 1970 federal rules that prevent ABC, NBC and CBS
from having a financial interest in the programs they broadcast or
from selling those programs in the lucrative U.S. rerun market.
   The television industry is being pressured by Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission to resolve their differences.
   Valenti, speaking at a news conference here, said NBC should
have placed a disclaimer on the Brokaw program noting NBC's
interest in the so-called financial interest and syndication talks.
   The program, he said, ``was the clearest and most visible
example of how a network abuses its vast power.''
   The FCC last week began a study of the financial interest and
syndication rules, but said it would hold up the process for 90
days to give the studios and networks a final opportunity to work
out their differences without government intervention.
   ``If enough bias can be created in Washington ... I think that
might have an influence'' on the way the FCC or Congress decides
the issue, Valenti said.
   ``Nowhere did the show, in its criticism of `conglomerates,'
reveal that NBC itself is owned by a huge conglomerate, General
Electric,'' he wrote in the letter to the network.
   Valenti emphasized that he was not questioning Brokaw's
integrity.
   ``I don't think Tom Brokaw had a bias. ... I trust Tom Brokaw,''
Valenti told reporters.
   He said his quarrel with NBC was its failure to disclose that it
was in a ``political struggle and a regulatory struggle'' with the
studios it was criticizing.
   ``Any suggestion that `The New Hollywood' was an instrument of
GE or NBC corporate policy is wrong, outrageous and personally
insulting,'' Brokaw said in a statement. ``The documentary was
conceived, produced an edited solely by NBC News.''
   Wright, in a written response to Valenti, echoed Brokaw's words.
   ``Your assertion that I would direct NBC News to compromise its
journalistic integrity to further NBC's or GE's business interests
is appalling and an insult to Tom Brokaw and his colleagues,'' he
wrote.
   ``There are enough real issues to debate without making up
scurrilous accusations,'' Wright said. ``We are serious about
achieving a reasonable solution to the financial interest and
syndication rules. Let's get on with it.''
   Rutledge said the program ``acknowleded that vertical
integration is taking place and that foreign media conglomerates
are buying up Hollywood at a rapid pace.''
   ``Mr. Valenti is a lobbyist for those foreign companies,''
Rutledge said. ``He would no doubt prefer that the activities of
his foreign clients were less visibly reported on.''

   The lower reaches of two Florida Panhandle rivers kept rising
Friday, a week after heavy rain inland over Alabama and Georgia,
and most of the 2,500 people evacuated in the region remained
homeless.
   Evacuees have started returning to sodden homes in Alabama,
where up to 16 inches of rain fell.
   Eleven deaths in Alabama were blamed on the rain and flooding,
and searchers took to the air in helicopters Friday looking for a
possible 12th victim, a postal clerk whose car was found in a
flooded ditch.
   In Georgia, less damage than expected was reported, as high
water from flooding in the north flowed downstream to the sea.
Minor flooding was reported in the Albany area Friday along the
swollen Flint River.
   In Florida, the last of the evacuees were three families who
left their homes Friday along the lower Apalachicola River in the
Bloody Bluff area of Franklin County, said sheriff's Maj. Jimmy
Williams.
   ``While no water had entered their homes they decided to leave
while they could,'' Williams said. ``It's still coming this way
about an inch every hour.''
   Scores of people fled their homes farther up the Apalachicola
near Wewahitchka in Gulf County where the river crested Friday.
   The Choctawhatchee River kept rising in southern Walton and
Washington counties and a small portion of Bay County. It was
receding only very slowly farther north at hard-hit Caryville,
where about 600 people fled their homes.
   The National Weather Service reported the Choctawhatchee at
Caryville was still at 17.6 feet, or 5.6 feet above flood stage,
Friday after dropping 2 feet in 24 hours.
   Water remained in most Caryville homes but should recede
Saturday when the river is expected to drop below 16 feet.
   Across Alabama, many flood victims have begun lining up in front
of American Red Cross disaster centers.
   A scuffle erupted at a Red Cross relief center in Selma, where
people had waited for hours to sign up for food, clothes and
blankets.
   Howard Tinsley, who directs the Red Cross office in Selma, told
the crowd to leave a makeshift shelter at a school gymnasium and go
to another center. ``All I can do is apologize to them for the long
wait, but we needed to move them away from the shelter to another
location,'' Tinsley said after the altercation.

<HEAD>Skinner Urged To Require Mandatory Alcohol Testing</HEAD>

   Two senators urged Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner on Friday to move quickly to require random alcohol
testing of airline pilots and other transportation workers.
   ``There is no excuse for pilots drinking and flying,'' Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and John Danforth, R-Mo., said in a letter
to Skinner, citing the March 8 arrest of a Northwest Airlines
cockpit crew.
   The senators sponsored legislation passed by the Senate that
would require random alcohol tests, but the bill has been bottled
up in the House Public Works Committee.
   ``We urge you to exercise the full extent of your authority to
ensure that an incident such as that which occurred March 8th on
Northwest Airlines never happens again,'' the senators wrote.
   The Transportation Department is reviewing comments it solicited
from November through March 9 on alcohol testing before proposing a
specific program, said Hal Paris, a Transportation Department
spokesman.
   The department issued rules last November for testing
transportation workers for drugs.
   Skinner said last year that ``a lot more thought needs to go
into the idea of extending random drug testing to alcohol.''
   Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., who chairs the House Public Works
subcommittee on aviation, says random alcohol testing is unfair to
workers because of the mistakes that can occur.
   The three-man Northwest crew flew a Boeing 727 with 91
passengers from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis on March 8 while
legally intoxicated, investigators say.
   Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; First Officer Robert
Kirchner, 35, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and Second Officer Joseph
Balzer, 34, of Antioch, Tenn. were fired by the airline and charged
by federal and state officials with operating an aircraft while
under the influence of alcohol.
   Tests taken after the arrests showed they had blood-alcohol
levels ranging from 0.06 percent to 0.12 percent, investigators
say. Federal regulations prohibit pilots from flying if they have
alcohol levels higher than 0.04 percent. The legal limit for
driving a vehicle is 0.10 in most states.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Friday that recent reforms in South Africa failed
to make substantial changes.
   His comments differed from observations made Thursday by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other U.S. officials
following meetings in Cape Town with President F.W. de Klerk and
black nationalists.
   Shevardnadze met with de Klerk in Namibia this week during
ceremonies marking the nation's independence from 75 years of South
African rule.
   He flew to Harare late Thursday on the fourth stop of a
six-nation African tour. It is the first trip to the area by a
Soviet foreign minister.
   The Soviets long supplied weapons to black nationalist
guerrillas fighting the South African government. Moscow has no
formal diplomatic relations with South Africa, having severed
contact 34 years ago because of South Africa's apartheid policies
of racial separation and white dominance.
   Shevardnadze told diplomats and government officials Friday in
Harare that de Klerk reforms _ including release of African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and legalizing the ANC and
other anti-apartheid groups _ are not irreversible steps toward
ending apartheid.
   ``No one should have either the reason for euphoria or hope that
the situation inside South Africa has changed substantially,''
Shevardnadze said.
   He said Moscow supported peaceful solutions to South Africa's
racial conflict and that there was ``a clear indication toward
dialogue.''
   ``But, in the meantime, the changes that have taken place so far
have not yet become irreversible.''
   He earlier told reporters de Klerk's reforms opened a new era
for peace in southern Africa.
   Baker, after meeting with de Klerk on Thursday in Cape Town,
said the president told him the reform process was ``irreversible.''
   A U.S. official accompanying Baker said the secretary had
doubted the government's commitment, but Thursday's meeting changed
his mind.
   On the first visit there by an U.S. secretary of state in 12
years, Baker also met with Foreign Minister Pik Botha and a
delegation of officials from the ANC and other anti-apartheid
groups.
   The ANC is to hold preliminary talks with de Klerk on April 11
as a possible step toward formal negotiations on rewriting the
constitution to give the black majority national voting rights.
   Shevardnadze met for nearly an hour Friday with President Robert
Mugabe at the provincial town of Kadoma, 87 miles southwest of
Harare, a Soviet Embassy spokesman said.
   The talks touched on conflicts in Angola and neighboring
Mozambique, he reported.
   Shevardnadze is to leave Zimbabwe for Tanzania on Saturday. He
will end his African tour in Nigeria.

<TEXT>
   Under U.S. pressure, Cuba announced Friday it has
withdrawn its bid to play host to a major U.N. development
conference.
   A Cuban official told the governing body of the U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development that the event would take place in another
Latin American country, according to the text of the speech.
   Eduardo Delgado criticized the ``stubborn and unjust position''
of the United States, which has now blocked three attempts to hold
the conference in Cuba. U.S. officials have refused to attend the
event if it is held there.
   The 168-nation conference is the main forum for dialogue between
Third World countries and industrial nations on issues such as
commodity prices, debt and economic cooperation. It takes place
every four years, and its host site is supposed to rotate among
developing countries.
   Raul Espana-Smith of Bolivia, leader of the conference's Latin
American group, declared that all members of the U.N. forum had
supported Cuba's bid to play host ``with the exception of one
state,'' a reference to the United States.
   This state had ``exercised pressure and flaunted the U.N.'s
fundamental principles, namely respect for the equality and
sovereignty of each member state,'' he said.
   U.S. delegate Kyle Scott earlier told the meeting that
Washington feared Cuba would use its ``role and influence as host
country to politicize this conference and this organization.''
   The last conference in 1987 was held in Geneva as a compromise
site after the United States refused to go to Havana. The 1983
conference took place in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, for the same reason.

   The Red Cross says $33.8 million
donated for relief after the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake will
be distributed in Northern California, not used for disasters
elsewhere.
   The $33.8 million, which will go to private and public programs
in seven counties, is what remains of the $55.3 million donated to
the Red Cross specifically as relief for the temblor, which killed
67 people and caused $7 billion in damage.
   The nonprofit international relief organization planned to use
much of the remaining money for disasters elsewhere. But the Red
Cross changed its mind after criticism from San Francisco Mayor Art
Agnos and others, who said the money contributed for earthquake
relief should be spent in Northern California.
   The city and county of San Francisco will receive the largest
single allocation, $5.4 million, to help finance two centers for
homeless people displaced when the earthquake ruined 700
inexpensive hotel rooms, the Red Cross announced Thursday.
   So far, the Red Cross has spent over $13 million on direct
relief and expects to spend an additional $9.4 million for
outstanding bills and continuing aid to earthquake victims.
   Agnos, who had sought up to $7.9 million to help the city's
homeless, praised the Red Cross.
   ``As a mayor, I know the feeling of being on the receiving end
of a barrage of criticism,'' Agnos said. ``I am grateful they
listened to our ideas on how to help those affected by the
earthquake.''
   A 10-member Red Cross committee, which reviewed 80 requests from
public and private organizations seeking a total of $78 million,
granted 37 of the requests and will consider an additional 20, said
Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman.

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says World's Poorest Countries Getting Poorer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new U.N. report painted a bleak picture Friday
of the world's 42 poorest countries becoming poorer, with economic
growth rates lagging behind the population explosion.
   It blamed domestic policy failures and lack of international
help, and urged ``enormous endeavors'' to reverse the decline.
   The secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, which released the report, called for a relief program
that would double development assistance and eliminate bilateral
debt.
   Average annual growth of the countries' gross domestic product
was 2.3 percent during 1980-88, compared to a 7.2 percent target
set by a special U.N. conference in 1981, according to the 250-page
report.
   Agricultural production, affected in some countries by drought
or floods, grew by 2 percent annually, half the targeted growth. At
the same time, the population increased by 2.4 percent every year
to a present estimated total of 440 million.
   This would reach 882 million by the year 2015 if present
demographic trends continue. For the Third World as a whole, the
population increase is expected to total 65 percent the next 25
years to about 4.8 billion, the report said.
   The 42 countries surveyed were Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Benin,
Bhutan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central
African Republic, Chad, Comoros, North Yemen, South Yemen,
Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Malawi, Maldives,
Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Burma, Nepal, Niger, Ruanda, Samoa,
Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Tuvalu,
Uganda, Tanzania and Vanuatu.
   Their share of world exports declined to 0.3 percent in 1988,
down from 1.4 percent in 1960. Total outstanding debt doubled from
1982 to 1988 to $69 billion.
   A prime factor was the declining trend in world prices for
primary commodities that still make up about two-thirds of their
total exports, the report noted.
   But it also said domestic policies had been an ``important
factor in restricting export development.''
   The report said rising demand for food, water, land, firewood,
and other natural resources had further aggravated an already
precarious ecological balance in many of the countries.
   It said a new class of displaced persons have emerged in these
countries in the 1980's _ ``environmental refugees.''
   ``Growing human pressure on the natural environment has either
rendered ecosystems more vulnerable or triggered off a
self-reinforcing process of natural degradation, or both. As a
result, more people are affected by natural catastrophes, such as
landslides, cyclones, earthquakes and flood than before.''
   Domestic economic adjustment programs failed to get enough
outside financial support and achieved, ``at most, limited
success,'' the report said. Lack of financial resources also forced
cutbacks on spending for social services.
   It said ``the causes of the generally dismal performance are to
a very large extent related to domestic policy shortcomings coupled
with insufficient and inadequate international support.''
   A special U.N. conference is to deal with the situation in the
Least Developed Countries in Paris next September and consider
possible action.

<HEAD>Appellate Court Denies List's Bid for Change of Venue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Judge's name in 4th graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court Friday rebuffed
attempts by John E. List, accused of killing his family 18 years
ago, to move his trial and sequester the jury because of the
notoriety his case has drawn.
   The three-judge panel of the Appellate Division also denied
List's attorney's request for more peremptory challenges in
choosing a jury. Lawyers use the challenges to dismiss potential
jurors during selection.
   The lawyer, Elijah L. Miller Jr., repeatedly has asked the trial
judge for a change of venue from nearby Elizabeth and a sequestered
jury.
   Superior Judge William L'E. Wertheimer refused the requests in
January and again this week when the jury of 12 and four alternates
was chosen.
   Miller and Union County prosecutors made further arguments on
the issues in the chambers here of appellate Judge William A.
Dreier. Judges Nicholas Scalera and William D'Annunzio participated
by conference call.
   Wertheimer ended jury selection on the second day Wednesday
after Miller used up all 20 challenges allowed under state rules.
The judge declined to allow him any more, despite having the
discretion to do so.
   Since the beginning, Miller strenuously has argued that
extensive publicity given the case guarantees that List won't
receive a fair trial.
   During jury selection, a number of prospective panelists said
they had read or seen news accounts of the case when the bodies of
List's family were discovered in December 1971 and since List's
arrest in June. The arrest followed a tip to a nationally
television anti-crime show that featured his case.
   Some prospective jurors even said they remembered seeing that
broadcast.
   Many of those who acknowledged being exposed to the news
accounts were dismissed. Others were let on the panel after they
assured the judge and attorneys that they could remain impartial.
   Opening statements are scheduled for Friday after Wertheimer
decides whether to admit certain evidence to the trial.
   List says he is innocent because of his mental condition at the
time of the murders of his wife, mother and three children. Police
who entered their 18-room Westfield home found the bullet-ridden
bodies.
   List, a mild-mannered accountant, devout churchgoer and Sunday
school teacher, vanished into a new life as Robert Clark in Denver
and most recently Midlothian, Va., a suburb of Richmond, where he
was living with his wife of six years.

<HEAD>Pilot-Alcohol Case Produces Jokes for Some, Pain for Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of three Northwest Airlines pilots
accused of flying a passenger jet while intoxicated has been the
source of jokes by some television comedians and airline passengers.
   For Northwest pilots, it's a bad joke.
   What pilots aren't laughing at are remarks such as one by
television talk show host Pat Sajak: ``We had sleet and hail in Los
Angeles last night. Either that or a Northwest Airlines cockpit
crew was having frozen Margaritas.''
   Pilots tell of embarking passengers poking their heads into the
cockpit recently and jokingly asking, ``Do you mind if I smell your
breath?''
   ``You hear an awful lot of comments'' in the cockpit before a
flight, said one Northwest pilot who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``You are supposed to have the door open and greet the people,''
he said. ``There are days now when you want to close the door and
not deal with them.''
   Rich Saikel of the Air Line Pilots Association said the union
has been flooded with calls from upset pilots besieged by passenger
comments. The union believes that some of the remarks border on
accusations, which they say could ruin careers.
   ``In my opinion, if it is a clear-cut accusation, I would ask a
law enforcement agency to detain the passenger to ascertain the
basis for their comment and the crew member needs to be tested to
prove their innocence,'' Saikel said.
   The jokes have been building since March 9, the day after the
cockpit crew of a Northwest flight carrying 91 passengers from
Fargo, N.D., to the Twin Cities was placed under citizen's arrest
on suspicion of flying while intoxicated.
   The three allegedly had been drinking heavily in a bar in
Moorhead the night before. Blood-alcohol tests after they landed in
the Twin Cities showed that all three exceeded the legal limit of
.04 percent, officials have said.
   The three, who were fired by Northwest and had their pilot
licenses revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration, were
charged Thursday by federal and state officials with operating an
aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.
   The charges were filed by the U.S. attorney's office in
Minneapolis and by North Dakota officials against Capt. Norman
Prouse of Conyers, Ga.; First Officer Robert Kirchner of Highland
Ranch, Colo., and Second Officer Joseph Balzer of Antioch, Tenn.
   Saikel said the incident has ``hurt innocent people. I have been
flying commercial airlines around this world for 13 years, but
there has not been a widespread problem. But the question has been
raised in the public's mind of the integrity of the flight crews.''
   In the meantime, the one-liners continue in the air and on the
airwaves. On ``The Tonight Show,'' guest host Jay Leno made this
observation about the Northwest crew: ``They wouldn't have got
caught, but a group of passengers saw them riding around and around
on the baggage carousel.''

   Former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood will face hearings to determine if he should continue
holding his maritime master's license, Coast Guard Commandant Paul
Yost said Friday.
   ``I think there will be a procedure against the license of that
master,'' Yost said at a news conference at which he also evaluated
environmental damage to Prince William Sound, site of the nation's
worst oil spill a year ago.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, ripped its hull open on a
reef on March 24, 1989. Hazelwood was charged last year with a
felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors, but was
convicted Thursday on only one count _ negligent discharge of oil.
   Yost said Hazelwood faces suspension, revocation or renewal of
his license. Exxon fired him shortly after the disaster.
   Although Yost blamed human error for the spill, he appeared to
partially absolve Hazelwood of responsibility.
   ``A fully qualified third mate ran the vessel aground,'' he said.
   It was clear from the trial and from other evidence that human
error caused the grounding, Yost said. No matter what technological
changes are introduced or what new laws are enacted, the Coast
Guard cannot guarantee that similar groundings will not happen
again, he said.
   ``We've got to be very careful we don't have a spasm response''
to the spill, he said.
   Yost denied claims that the Coast Guard's system of tracking
vessels had failed before the spill.
   ``The system was never designed to track tankers outside the
(Valdez) Arm,'' he said. Bligh Reef, which the tanker struck, is
near the end of the arm but outside the normal shipping channels.
The Exxon Valdez was outside the outbound channel to avoid floating
ice.
   However, Yost said the Coast Guard would install a new radar
system that will be better able to track tankers, especially in bad
weather.
   The new radar probably will reach to Bligh Reef, although the
area never has been considered difficult to navigate, he said.
   Congress is considering legislation that would allow the Coast
Guard to conduct more detailed background investigations of
prospective ship captains and mates, Yost said.
   Federal privacy statutes had kept the Coast Guard from delving
sufficiently into the histories of merchant marine officers in the
past, he said.
   Drug and alcohol abuse by applicants would be a major factor
considered in the licensing process, he said.
   One of the accusations against Hazelwood was that he was
intoxicated while in command of the vessel. Jurors did not buy that
argument, however, because blood alcohol tests were not conducted
until 10{ hours after the accident.

<HEAD>Judge Says Thornburgh Won't Have to Come to Wichita</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawsuit over a drug-laden plane leased to
federal agents and linked to the Contras was settled out of court
Friday, sparing U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh a trip to
Wichita to testify.
   ``I approved the settlement this afternoon and the case is
over,'' U.S. District Judge Patrick Kelly said, a week after
ordering Thornburgh to appear in court April 2 to explain why the
government abandoned an earlier settlement.
   Kelly said Friday that his approval of the settlement between
government attorneys and the plaintiffs makes moot the issue of
Thornburgh's appearance.
   A spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington, Michael
Robinson, confirmed the settlement but had no other comment.
   The case involved a twin-engine Beech King Air ditched in the
Caribbean Sea on Jan. 3, 1983. The pilot, convicted smuggler
Michael Toliver, later testified that he flew arms to Nicaragua's
Contra rebels and illegal drugs back to the United States several
times under the supervision of federal agents.
   The judge canceled a civil trial over the plane's loss, set for
January, after being told in November that the case had been
settled through mediation. Then last week, Richard Montague, an
assistant U.S. attorney general from Washington, told Kelly that
Justice Department officials had never approved that settlement.
Montague said the case should go to trial.
   Kelly then ordered Thornburgh to appear and straighten out the
lawsuit's status.
   The judge said at the time that he also was frustrated with the
government's response to Toliver's disclosures and that he thought
the case involved criminal conduct by the United States.
   Montague objected, saying Toliver was the only witness making
such statements and that his credibility was questionable.
   He also said the insurance case had nothing to do with those
statements and that the question of whether a criminal
investigation was warranted was up to the attorney general, not the
judge.
   Toliver, serving a marijuana smuggling sentence in North
Carolina, was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony.
   He testified in Kelly's court in 1987 that he made two trips to
Honduras and Colombia the previous year with arms for the Contras
and returned to the United States with loads of cocaine and
marijuana. He said he landed at Homestead Air Force Base, Fla.,
with one drug load and that he worked as an informant and contract
employee under federal supervision.
   Toliver testified that he wasn't working for the government when
he crashed the plane. He said he had disconnected a U.S. Customs
Service homing device aboard the plane and took off in another
direction with a load of marijuana. He ditched the craft off Grand
Cayman Island when he ran out of fuel trying to avoid storms.
   The lawsuit was filed by Midland National Bank of Newton, Kan.,
which said it had a $198,000 lien on the plane.
   The defendants included the plane's owner, Walter Conlogue, who
said his company, American Aircraft Co. of Newton, leased the
aircraft to U.S. Customs agents to help in an undercover
investigation.
   Puritan Insurance Co. of Stamford, Conn., refused to pay a claim
on the plane's $225,000 insurance policy, saying Conlogue lied
about the plane's use. Conlogue said he was warned that if he did
not do so, ``innocent people would suffer and be killed.''
   The insurance company was both a plaintiff and a defendant in
the lawsuit. The government was also a defendant.
   The judge was so alarmed by Toliver's statements in 1987 that he
ordered transcripts sent to the FBI, CIA and to then-President
Reagan.

<HEAD>Australian Prime Minister Tries for Record Fourth Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10 million Australians went
to the polls Saturday in an election to decide Labor Party Prime
Minister Bob Hawke's quest for an unprecedented fourth term.
   Polling organizations predicted a close race between Labor and
Andrew Peacock's conservative coalition unifying the Liberal and
National parties.
   Peacock, 51, on Saturday predicted at least a 12-seat victory in
the House of Representatives.
   If Hawke prevails, he will become the first Labor leader to win
a fourth term of office. Hawke, 60, has been in office seven years.
   The election is for 148 seats in the House of Representatives
seats and 40 in the Senate. Labor had 85 seats in the outgoing
house, the Liberal Party 45 and its coalition partner the National
Party, 18.
   A pre-election Morgan Gallup poll had the opposition leading the
government by 42 percent to 39.5 percent of the popular vote.
Australia has 10.6 million eligible voters, and voting is
compulsory.
   Polling booths close at 6 p.m. in the eastern states. The state
of Western Australia is two hours behind. Saturday's weather was
sunny over most of Australia, which is about the size of the United
States.
   The economy was the main issue of the five-week campaign.
   Labor ran on its record of economic management, despite a
foreign debt of $100 billion and record 18 percent interest rates
that hurt home buyers and small businesses.
   Peacock asked Australians to dump Labor for a government that
will help the ``battlers,'' as Australians call poorer working
people. He warns the country faces a recession.
   Australia's metropolitan daily newspapers were divided Saturday
over which side is best equipped to govern for the next three years.
   Rupert Murdoch's flagship, The Australian, said: ``The future
may be uncertain and unsettling, but we know what life would be
like under Labor: the future would resemble the past. And that past
_ the painful, grinding, wasted years of its third term _ has been
unacceptable.''
   The Sydney Morning Herald said: ``It is a time for tough
leadership. Labor under Mr. Hawke and (Federal Treasurer) Paul
Keating seems more likely than the coalition under Mr. Peacock to
provide.''

   Joseph Hazelwood faltered in the difficult
task of skippering the Exxon Valdez, but the greatest blame for the
nation's worst oil spill rests elsewhere, two professional mariners
said Friday.
   And as long as ships laden with oil continue to ply coastal
shipping lanes for a fuel-hungry public, accidents are possible,
they said.
   An Alaska jury acquitted Hazelwood on Thursday of charges of
being drunk, recklessness and criminal mischief in connection with
the nearly 11 million gallon spill in Prince William Sound one year
ago Saturday. He was convicted of negligently discharging oil, a
misdemeanor.
   ``I'm glad that Hazelwood got released from that burden,'' said
Olaf Meyer, 82, of San Pedro, whose 54-year maritime career
included shepherding tankers in Alaska for Standard Oil and working
as a Los Angeles Port pilot.
   Meyer said that although Hazelwood erred in leaving the bridge
while the ship was out of its normal shipping channel to avoid
floating ice, he did not deserve conviction on criminal charges.
   Meyer said Exxon shouldn't necessarily reverse its decision to
fire Hazelwood. His decision to leave the bridge, and questions
about his sobriety, are justification for keeping him from a
captain's post, Meyer said.
   Prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to prove that Hazelwood was
drunk at the time of the accident. He underwent an
alcohol-rehabilitation program in 1985 after two drunken-driving
convictions.
   ``Exxon already gave him a lot of latitude,'' Meyer said.
   Carl McCormick, 38, a Los Angeles Harbor pilot and vice
president of the Los Angeles Port Pilots Local 68, was stronger in
his defense of Hazelwood and critical of the oil industry's role in
such accidents.
   ``Hazelwood was being judged before the facts came out,''
McCormick said. ``He made a poor judgment decision by leaving the
bridge when he did. But you have to look beyond why someone who
makes thousands of sound decisions makes one bad one.
   ``We think that is due to (crew cutbacks) and the extreme number
of hours and extreme pressure put on people forced to work beyond
safe limits.''
   McCormick, who said Hazelwood was unfairly fired and deserves
his job back, called Exxon ``the guilty party'' in the spill. The
company has called the spill an accident and denied any culpability.
   The public is unaware of the stress faced by those responsible
for guiding vessels that can be as long as three football fields,
said McCormick, who has worked for several oil companies.
Sixteen-hour days, increasingly heavy paperwork and burdensome
technology take a heavy toll, he said.
   ``You look at Hazelwood and think, `There but for the grace of
God goes me or any other tanker captain.' It's not a situation
nobody else has been in; he happened to be the unlucky one.''

<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese fish broker who admitted arranging to
smuggle 500 tons of illegally caught salmon into this country was
sentenced Friday to nearly six years in prison.
   Patrick Lee, 42, whose arrest July 18 was part of a dual action
on the high seas and outside a major Seattle bank, also was ordered
by U.S. District Judge Carolyn R. Dimmick to pay $66,000 in
restitution. But the judge said that amount might be reduced by the
amounts five others are ordered to pay when they are sentenced.
   ``No further fine will be imposed because he is unable to pay
it,'' the judge said.
   Lee apologized ``for the mistake I have committed'' and promised
to work for greater wildlife protection measures by the Taiwanese
government. He could have faced as much as 30 years in prison and
$1 million in fines.
   U.S. fishermen have complained that Taiwanese and others are
``overfishing'' salmon by catching them in driftnets supposedly set
for other species, such as squid.
   The case was based on the Lacey Act, which bars the importing of
illegally caught fish or wildlife. The judge ruled that a Taiwanese
administrative ban on salmon fishing by Taiwanese vessels
constituted a foreign law, making the fish contraband under U.S.
law.
   Defense attorney Mark Mestel said he would appeal that ruling,
which resulted in Lee pleading guilty to conspiracy, smuggling and
money-laundering.
   ``Mr. Lee could not have been prosecuted in Taiwan'' because the
regulation applied only to the vessel operator and skipper, he told
Dimmick. ``The fish broker could not be punished.''
   However, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Chadwell said Lee knew
he was violating U.S. law during the six-month ``sting'' that led
to his arrest.
   The sting, which involved agents from the National Marine
Fisheries Service, Coast Guard and Customs Service, began in March
1989 after Lee offered to sell a U.S. seafood processor large
quantities of salmon caught in driftnets used by Taiwanese vessels
to catch squid.
   Lee, who had been in business about two years, subsequently
agreed to sell an undercover agent 500 metric tons of salmon for
$1.3 million.
   The trap was sprung July 18 as two Taiwanese squid fishing boats
delivered salmon to a refrigerator ship chartered by two undercover
agents in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Three of Lee's
associates were arrested on the U.S. vessel, and Lee and two others
were arrested after examining $1.3 million in a bank safe deposit
box in Seattle and leaving with $330,000.
   The $66,000 Lee was ordered to repay represented money one of
his associates had accepted as an advance payment.
   Lee was sentenced to 70 months for money laundering and 60
months each for conspiracy and smuggling, all three to be served
concurrently. Counting time served and good time in prison, he
could be released in less than 4{ years, said Mestel.

<TEXT>
   A retired Dominican Republic general has jumped
bond and returned to his homeland rather than face trial here for
his role in an alleged bribery scheme to free seized drug planes,
federal officials said Friday.
   Joaquin Pou, 55, was indicted and arrested in November along
with the former chairman of Florida's Democratic Party, Alfredo
Duran, and Pou's aide Jose Guasch.
   Pou and the others were charged with violating the federal
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Freed on $50,000 bond, Pou failed to
report as required on Feb. 21, and was declared a fugitive,
according to court documents released Friday.
   Pou's attorney, Jeffrey Swartz, told The Associated Press he had
flown to Santo Domingo to persuade his client to return.
   ``I told him that while I could make no guarantees, I felt
certain that he would be acquitted and that he should certainly
return to Miami,'' Swartz said, saying he felt hopeful Pou would
return.
   He also noted that even if convicted, his client would only
serve 2{ to three years in prison.
   Pou reportedly went on television on his homeland to explain why
he refused to submit to a U.S. trial.
   When Pou was first arraigned, he had to surrender all travel
documents and sign a waiver agreeing not to fight extradition back
to the United States.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
she could not comment on Pou's case, but said it was the
department's policy to pursue all extradition cases.
   Also on Friday, Robert Gurin, a Miami airplane recovery
specialist named in the original federal complaint but never
indicted, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the same act.
Sentencing was set for May 23.
   Gurin has cooperated with federal investigators, according to
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to affidavits filed in the case, the government
investigated Gurin because of allegations he had bribed
high-ranking military officials in the Dominican Republic and other
Caribbean countries to recover drug planes.
   The government used an informant to pose as an agent for the
owner of a plane seized by the Dominican military. Gurin allegedly
told the informant that Duran would channel the money to Dominican
generals through his escrow account, the affidavit said.
   Between February and October, the informant met with Gurin, Pou,
Guasch and Duran to iron out details of the bribery scheme, the
affidavit said. Most of the meetings were tape-recorded or
videotaped by FBI and Customs officials.
   Duran, who headed the state Democratic Party from 1976 to 1980,
has denied the allegations, and has accused U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen, a former Republican state senator, of political
motivations in the case.
   Lehtinen's office has denied that charge, saying the case was
presented to and approved by a federal grand jury.

   A Cuban domestic aircraft caught fire when it
tried to take off Friday from the interior city of Santiago and 20
people were injured, Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina said.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, said at least three of
the injured were in serious condition.
   Prensa Latina said most of the 41 people on the Havana-bound
flight, including 18 of the injured, were Mexican tourists.
   It said the AN-26 aircraft was unable to lift off and fell into
a depression on the right side of the runway at the airport in
Santiago, about 500 miles southeast of Havana.

<HEAD>Canadian Cookies Recalled After Razor Blade Found in Box</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PETERBOROUGH, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dare Foods Ltd. said Friday it has
recalled a U.S.-packaged brand of animal crackers, sold only in
Canada, because an 11-year-old girl found part of a metal blade in
a box of the cookies.
   Dare School Bus Animal Cookies were being removed from store
shelves across Canada, said Gary MacLeod, vice president of sales
for Dare, of Kitchener, Ontario.
   ``We've contacted our warehouses and asked them to isolate
shipments and have asked our sales representatives to pull the
product from the stores,'' MacLeod said. Customers can return the
cookies to stores for refunds, he added. The girl was not injured
and no other problems have been reported, he said. MacLeod said
Dare receives the cookies fully packaged from Dairy State Foods
Inc. of Milwaukee and distributes them to stores in every Canadian
province. The cookies are made exclusively for Dare and sold only
in Canada.
   He said he could not estimate how many boxes of crackers were in
distribution but expected it would take about 10 days to clear the
product from the market.
   Federal Health and Welfare spokesman Doreen Moore said officials
suspect the piece of blade could have accidently gotten into the
box during packaging before the crackers were shipped to Canada.
   ``It might have been (from the blade of a utility knife) used to
open a box,'' MacLeod said.
   The box did not appear to have been tampered with, but Ms. Moore
said officials have not ruled out sabotage.
   Denise Shaughnessy said her 11-year-old daughter, Crystal-Ann,
discovered the metal piece in the box of cookies while walking home
from school.
   ``She just took it out and put it into her pocket _ not
realizing how dangerous it could have been _ and kept eating,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   The first week of jury selection in the fraud
trial of Imelda Marcos and Adnan Khashoggi ended Friday with the
judge having chosen 45 potential jurors.
   The prospective jurors, selected from a pool of 150, will be
considered for the final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates to
be chosen Tuesday when the trial resumes in federal court.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged in the alleged illegal transfer of
more than $160 million from the Manila government and defrauding
banking institutions of $165 million more.
   Her husband, former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, was
named in the original October 1988 indictment but died in Hawaii on
Sept. 28.
   Khashoggi, a Saudi financier once described as the world's
richest man, is accused of helping the Marcoses conceal a series of
New York real estate deals allegedly financed in part with money
stolen from the Philippines' treasury.
   In an interview with Khashoggi broadcast Friday on ABC's
``20-20,'' Barbara Walters said he told her that he never dealt
directly with the Marcoses, but rather with an aide to Mrs. Marcos.
   Walters said Khashoggi told her the real estate deal was a
straight business swap _ ownership of New York City buildings for
shares of an oil mining project in the Sudan.
   He said the deal made sense because it would have provided the
Philippines with a source of oil it needs to import.
   Judge John F. Keenan told defense lawyers Friday to follow court
rules that allow them to discuss only what has been revealed in
court. Prosecutors had complained Thursday that Mrs. Marcos'
lawyer, Gerald Spence, was talking too much to the press.
   ``Lawyers are supposed to conduct themselves under the rules. If
they don't, sanctions will be imposed,'' Keenan said. ``I've never
been one to back off from a fight.''

<HEAD>Council of Europe Discusses Help to Fledgling Eastern Democracies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 23-nation Council of Europe met in
special session Friday and discussed ways to help Eastern Europe's
fledgling democracies.
   Diplomats from seven East European countries also are attending
the meeting, billed the biggest all-European forum since World War
II. But the two-day session will be fully open to them only on
Saturday.
   On Friday, the officials also discussed ways of raising the
institution's profile and the possibility of forging closer links
with the United States and Canada.
   A working paper presented on Friday suggested the council could
in time become a trans-Atlantic watchdog for human rights set out
by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in the 1977
Helsinki accords.
   The idea to meet East bloc perestroika with a new look for the
Council of Europe, the oldest postwar organization working for
European unity, was advanced by Secretary-General Catherine
Lalumiere and the chairman, Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de
Deus Pinheiro.
   The council, founded in 1949, has been largely overshadowed by
the more influential European Community, a separate 12-nation
organization which began as the European Common Market, but
expanded from its trading bloc status.
   With the rush toward democracy in Eastern Europe and toward
German unification, Ms. Lalumiere says the council has gained
stature as the only European organization flexible enough to adapt
quickly.
   ``Most delegates said it was ridiculous to create a new code and
control mechanism, because one already exists,'' she told a news
conference after the first day of meetings.
   The council's 1950 Human Rights Convention already protects
individual Europeans with a sophisticated commission and court
mechanism and its proponents argue it could be easily extended to
cover Eastern Europe and North America.
   Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union have already
acquired what council officials call ``special guest status,'' and
Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechoslovakia have applied. Hungary,
Poland and Yugoslavia also requested full membership.
   Romania has made no applications and will not attend the Lisbon
meeting. ``For (East European countries), the Council of Europe
constitutes the symbol of democratic values from which they have
been cut off for 40 years,'' Deus Pinheiro told delegates Friday.
   ``They need vital support to help build their democracies.''
   The working paper Friday also proposed possible association
status to the council for the United States and Canada.
   U.S. and Canadian officials have participated to some extent in
the council's work but have focussed more on the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe. That organization includes
North America and all European countries except Albania as the
major East-West forum.
   In East Europe, the council has already sent experts to help
Hungary organize local elections and could help Eastern Europe
revamp oppressive penal codes and overhaul previously rubber-stamp
parliaments.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told the
meeting official contacts should begin to forge closer links with
North America.
   ``We need the United States and Canada in the CSCE (Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe) and we want them in the
Council of Europe,'' said Genscher.
   He said more North American involvement would be welcomed also
by Moscow, which once regarded the Strasbourg-based council as a
mouthpiece for the capitalist West and its North Atlantic Treaty
Organization military alliance.
   The Soviet Union sees the council as a possible foundation for
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's vision of a common European home
that could eventually replace the NATO and the Warsaw Pact with
trans-Atlantic security forum.

   Connecticut has become the first state in
the nation to gain federal approval for a plan to protect
underground drinking water, state and federal environmental
officials said Friday.
   Under the program, known as the Wellhead Protection Plan, the
state will more accurately map out its underground water supplies
and will implement regulations aimed at preventing pollution near
underground water supplies.
   ``During the 1990s, under the program, we anticipate a
partnership with our communities to develop land use controls to
more adequately protect ground water resources,'' said state
Environmental Protection Commissioner Leslie Carothers.
   Carothers was joined at a news conference by Julie Belaga,
regional administrator for the federal Environmental Protection
Agency.
   ``The federal government and the EPA are very proud of
Connecticut,'' Belaga said. ``The program we are honoring today is
really a national model.''

   The United States is protesting the ouster of
U.S. diplomats from Lithuania and President Bush is cautioning the
Soviets that force against the secessionists would be ``bound to
backfire.''
   The protests were delivered Friday in Washington and in Moscow
after two American consular officials were given 12 hours to leave
Vilnius, the capital of the breakaway Baltic republic.
   The Soviet foreign ministry gave no explanation in telephoning
the order to the U.S. embassy in Moscow, U.S. officials said.
   The two Americans, Douglas Wake and Jon Purnell, had gone to
Vilnius from Leningrad to assess the standoff between local
authorities demanding national recognition and Soviets determined

   U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra
rebels agree to begin immediate disbanding of their forces in
Honduras, breaking a deadlock in the way of the peaceful transition
of power in their homeland.
   The agreement, reached Friday after talks by the Contras,
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and representatives of
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was praised by
President Daniel Ortega, whose Sandinistas have fought the rebels
for nine years.
   ``This is an accord that recognizes a national consensus and
this national consensus that will put an end to the war and bring
peace to Nicaragua,'' Ortega said in Managua, the Nicaraguan
capital.
   The Contras agreed Friday to begin demobilizing the 12,000
troops in Honduran base camps immediately and said they should all
be back in Nicaragua by April 20, five days before Mrs. Chamorro's
pro-U.S. government is inaugurated. The Contras said another 4,000
fighters in Nicaragua would move into ``security zones.''

   Joseph Hazelwood's attorney accused the
judge of ``Hazelwood bashing'' in ordering the Exxon Valdez's
ex-skipper to pay $50,000 and help clean beaches fouled when his
tanker hit a reef a year ago today.
   Hazelwood's lawyers said the 1,000 hours of community service
ordered Friday by Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone are excessive
and the amount in restitution is illegal and arbitrary punishment
for a single misdemeanor conviction for negligence.
   Defense attorney Thomas Russo accused Johnstone of playing to
the media and trying to override the jury's verdict Thursday that
absolved Hazelwood of more serious intoxication and recklessness
charges.
   During sentencing, the judge denounced Hazelwood for drinking
before his ship sailed and for being off the bridge when it went
aground and caused the nation's worst oil spill.

   Conservative and moderate Democrats hoping to
guide their party back to the White House are hearing from the
party's liberal wing today as Jesse Jackson addresses the annual
convention of the Democratic Leadership Council.
   Jackson's scheduled speech followed an admonition by Virginia
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder that all Democrats must strongly support the
party's presidential nominee in 1992.
   The meeting of the leadership council, formed by conservative
and moderate Democrats to counter the party's purported leftward
drift, occurs as the party's governing Democratic National
Committee continues its spring meeting in Indianapolis.
   Wilder, the nation's first black elected governor, told the
council, ``Those who lose our primaries must reject the temptation
to cling to a sense of personal injury and defeat. They must unite

   The Bush administration has its first payoff
after 10 months of pressuring the Japanese to buy more American
products, but members of Congress are warning much more needs to be
done.
   The administration announced Friday an agreement designed to
boost sales of U.S.-manufactured supercomputers in Japan by
removing some restrictions imposed by the Japanese government.
   The agreement, which is expected to be formally signed in April,
should open a $130 million-market for supercomputers purchased by
Japanese universities and other government agencies.
   The breakthrough came late Thursday night following two days of
intensive negotiations. U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
the new pact ``should give us full and effective access'' to the
Japanese government market.

<HEAD>Where's The Big Recession?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trained to believe that general recessions are
inevitable, many economists have searched diligently over the past
two years for supporting evidence.
   Occasionally they think they find that evidence and they make a
quick grab for it. But then, just as a youngster opens his squeezed
fist and finds he didn't catch the grasshopper, they discover they
have nothing.
   Month by month, bit by bit, the evidence seems to be presented:
lagging car sales, lower stock prices, weak retail sales, lowered
investor confidence, home starts off. Then the opposite occurs; the
numbers reverse themselves. No trend there.
   It's been that way for two years now, but rather than being
discouraged, some searchers are more convinced than ever that the
beast is out there, ready to pounce. ``It's been seven long
years,'' they say. ``It has to come.''
   In fact, some of them are convinced it must come. Recessions are
not all bad, these theorists say. Recessions might even be
necessary to kill off excesses of demand or expectations or
borrowing. They are corrective.
   The theorists are correct about the seven years. Measured
nationally, no recession has occurred in that time. National
figures, they say, are the only evidence. That's the way they were
trained; that's the way they believe.
   National statistics don't lie, they say, and you tend to agree.
In spite of lapses, corrections, revisions and adjustments, United
States economic figures are usually conceded to be the world's most
accurate.
   No, they may not lie, but some critics contend the economic
numbers hide the facts, at least from those who read them in a
certain way _ from those who by habit look for certain evidence and
ignore other evidence.
   The habitual way of proving recession is to examine the national
readings for gross national product, which is the total output of
goods and services. If the GNP shrinks for two successive quarters
you have a recession.
   By that definition there has been no recession since the fall of
1982.
   But what about regional recessions, or economic shrinkages that
affected some of the country but not all of it? Or industrywide
recessions that didn't spread to the general economy? By that
measure there have been lots of them.
   In that time period farm states have had a recession.
Simultaneously, mining and manufacturing states were down too.
Several states had deep recessions due to oil pricing. Real estate
has been off in several areas.
   At one point, Sindlinger &amp; Co., an economics researcher, told
clients that more than 30 states could be considered in recession.
But this important recession never showed up in the national
numbers. Coastal booms offset it.
   Those who work in specific industries can relate their recession
woes. Among these industries: farming, mining, homebuilding,
defense, automobiles. Remember the oil patch problems and the rust
belt?
   Right now, there is a recession in the securities industry; more
than half the brokerage houses on the New York Stock Exchange lost
money in the fourth quarter of 1989. Savings and loans are in bad
shape. New England banks, too.
   To say there has been no recession in seven years is to ignore
the evidence of regional and industry recessions. This is the
contention of those who support the rolling readjustment or
traveling recession theory.
   They say that for reasons not fully understood _ perhaps it has
something to do with a better understanding of economics at the
Federal Reserve _ the nation has had its recession here and there a
bit at a time, piecemeal.
   The beast, they say, might have changed its habits. Rather than
crashing out of the jungle with a leap and a roar, it stalks the
edges of the economy, nibbling here and there, getting its way that
way, and covering its tracks.

   It's official: Peanut butter now has been
sticking to the roofs of our mouths for a century.
   Chunky or creamy, eaten plain or with jelly, bananas, mayonnaise
or marshmallows, peanut butter has stood the test of time _ and
that doesn't just mean a long day in a hot school lunch box.
   This month, peanut butter enthusiasts are celebrating the 100th
anniversary of the creation of the ideal family food _ cheap,
filling and nutritious, despite the high fat content _ that
celebrities also love.
   For starters, there's Elvis Presley. His favorite sandwich was
peanut butter and bananas, grilled in butter. According to
biographer Albert Goldman, Presley and his cronies once flew to
Colorado just to pick up a batch of gourmet peanut butter
sandwiches.
   Tennis player Chris Evert was said to eat peanut butter on
whole-grain bread as a last-minute snack before matches.
Conservative columnist George Will says he eats a peanut
butter-and-sweet-pickle sandwich, a family tradition, twice a week.
   Former President Ford is among the 50,000 members of the Adult
Peanut Butter Lovers Fan Club, and retired Sen. Barry Goldwater
once used peanut butter for shaving cream while on a camping trip.
   Peanut butter, in short, is an American classic _ and a $1
billion industry.
   Still, its origins remain something of a mystery.
   The Atlanta-based Peanut Advisory Board knows that a St. Louis
doctor is responsible for peanut butter's debut in March 1890 and
that patents for peanut grinding machines were issued several years
later. But it doesn't have a name for the man who first ground
peanuts into paste and spread them on a slice of bread.
   ``Nobody thought it was a big deal back then,'' said Suzanne
Corbett, a culinary historian in St. Louis who says she's close to
solving the case. ``They decided it was great-tasting and cheap,
but the emphasis was on commercialism, not invention.''
   According to the Peanut Advisory Board, the St. Louis doctor
created peanut butter as a nutritious protein substitute for his
elderly patients whose teeth were so poor they could not eat meat.
   The doctor, who made his peanut butter with a kitchen
hand-grinder, then went for mass marketing. George A. Bayle Jr.,
owner of a food products company, packaged and sold the spread, for
6 cents a pound.
   Bayle peanut butter cans from the 1910s bear the inscription:
``A sandwich a day keeps your children at play.''
   Since December, Corbett has been poring over the Bayle company
files, which are scattered over the St. Louis area, and has been in
contact with a woman in her 70s who worked for the Bayle company.
   She's narrowed the possibilities down to four men and is working
on the supposition that the inventor of peanut butter worked for a
sanitarium near Bayle's factory.
   ``It's sort of like peeling wallpaper off an old room,'' Corbett
said. ``You keep going down and down and down. I feel like I'm
right there.''
   Corbett is certain the credit should not go to Dr. John Harvey
Kellogg of Battle Creek, Mich., a surgeon who patented the first
peanut butter grinder. Kellogg made peanut butter around the same
time in his search for a vegetarian food for patients at his
sanitarium.
   According to Kellogg Co. archives, Kellogg and his brother, W.K.
Kellogg _ famous for his cereal company _ bought 10 pounds of
peanuts, roasted them in the oven, put the nuts in a pillow case to
remove the hulls, weeded out the husks and then put the remaining
material through grain rollers to make peanut butter.
   W.K. Kellogg, the business manager of the sanitarium, opened
Sanitas Nut Co. and supplied foods like peanut butter to the
sanitarium and local grocery stores. But after a while, John
Kellogg changed the formula and decided to steam the peanuts
instead.
   ``It tasted terrible,'' Corbett said. ``So they said, `To heck
with that, let's concentrate on cereal.'''
   Peanut butter was a big seller at the 1904 World's Fair in St.
Louis, but didn't really take off until much later. In the 1920s,
the process of stabilization was discovered, allowing it to be
stored without refrigeration.
   The biggest boost may have come during World War II. The
government fed peanut butter to GIs, who then came home, started
the baby boom and fed the stuff to their kids.
   Peanut butter was a regionalized industry until 1955, when
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. bought Big Top peanut butter and reintroduced
it as Jif, the No. 1 seller, and Best Foods bought Skippy.
   More peanut fun facts:
   _Peanuts, primarily grown in eight southern states, are the
nation's 12th largest cash crop. They're a $500 million-a-year crop
in Georgia, which produces nearly half the nation's supply.
   _It takes 548 peanuts to make a 12-ounce jar and an acre of
peanuts will yield 30,000 peanut butter sandwiches.
   _About half the 4 billion-pound annual crop is devoted to the
production of peanut butter and the other half is almost equally
split between salted nuts, candy and peanut oil.
   _Ninety percent of a jar of peanut butter must be peanuts, but
it also may contain salt, sweeteners and hydrogenated vegetable oil
as a stabilizer.
   _George Washington Carver discovered the peanut plant also could
be used in shaving cream, ink, paint, explosives, shampoo, pet
litter, fire logs, lipstick and soap.
   _Americans are expected to eat 800 million pounds of peanut
butter this year, more than double the 350 million pounds consumed
in 1960, according to the peanut board. That's an average of 3.3
pounds per person.
   _Although it's portrayed as a kid's food, adults actually
consume 55 percent.
   Not everyone loves peanut butter, of course. In fact, there's
even a word for the phobia of getting peanut butter stuck to the
roof of the mouth: arachibrityraphobia.
   The search for peanut butter's inventor continues. Coming up
with a name may not mean much for sales, but Corbett is convinced
it is important research.
   ``Food history is something we can all relate to,'' Corbett
said. ``Food transports one back in time. Combine the smells and
the taste, and it's an instant flashback.''

<HEAD>U.S., Japanese Stock Markets Going Separate Ways _ For Now</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Wall Street has shown it is capable of defying
the gravitational pull of the sliding Tokyo stock market,
challenging notions of global interdependence.
   But many securities strategists say it is foolish to conclude
the two largest stock markets are going separate ways.
   The securities boom of the 1980s gave rise to the view that the
world has become one big 24-hour trading floor, with buying and
selling moving seamlessly each day from the Far East to Western
Europe to the United States. Insomniac traders are linked around
the globe by telephone and computer.
   The most powerful and scary example of this globalization
occurred in the October 1987 market collapse, as panic selling
reverberated from continent to continent.
   But in the past month or so, tidal waves sweeping the Tokyo
market have turned into ripples _ or less _ by the time they
reached New York. Naysayers of globalization said the so-called
inextricable links were unraveling.
   Some strategists even argued that Tokyo's malaise is New York's
health tonic. They argue that Japanese investors, panicky about
further weakening of stocks in their own country, have been selling
them and buying U.S. shares instead.
   Some of the trading sessions last week seemed to reflect this
theory. On Monday, for example, Wall Street dropped initially but
shrugged off the third-biggest daily drop in Tokyo's key Nikkei
stock average. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the
day higher.
   On Tuesday, after another steep dive in Tokyo, the New York
market finished only mildly lower.
   On Thursday, when the Tokyo market sank to the lowest close
since Christmas eve of 1988, Wall Street sold off as well, but the
drop was by no means catastrophic. Some strategists said it was a
technical correction.
   ``I think we've delinked ourselves from Tokyo,'' said Larry
Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``They're
two different markets now.''
   Nonetheless, Wachtel and others believe, that could change if
Japanese investors were forced to sell their U.S. stocks to raise
cash for obligations at home.
   ``If the declines in (the Japanese) markets become too severe .
.. that's when all of the markets around the world will be
negatively impacted,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of
First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``At some point, they're going
to look like they've recoupled.''
   The tight connections between the Japanese and U.S. economies
mean their markets won't go separate ways indefinitely, some
observers believe.
   The resilience Wall Street has been showing in the face of
Tokyo's travails springs largely from foreign institutional
investors _ mainly Japanese and European _ who have moved chunks of
capital out of the Tokyo market and into New York.
   A major reason for the decline in Japan has been the weakening
yen, which makes stocks there worth less and increases inflation.
The Bank of Japan raised its key discount rate by one percentage
point Tuesday to 5.25 percent _ the fourth in a series of increases
intended mainly to fight inflation, but it didn't do much to help
the faltering Japanese currency.
   Against that background, foreign investors have been ``seeking
comfort in our financial markets,'' Johnson said.
   That's why even negative economic news in the United States,
like government reports last week on rising inflation and an
intractable trade deficit, haven't perturbed Wall Street too much.
   The dollar is relatively strong at the moment and the economic
grass, for now, seems to be greener on the American side.

<HEAD>Classes Liven Up with Events in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   American teachers are scrambling for effective
ways to interpret the democratic reforms in Eastern Europe for
students who think of the red scare as a bad skin rash.
   ``That is like a whole different world to them,'' said Linda
Hillestad, a geography teacher at Brookings Middle School in South
Dakota. ``Some are impressed and excited. `It's really neat,' they
say. But I don't know if they see that it's going to have any
effect on their future.''
   Ms. Hillestad said a weekly filmstrip called ``News Currents''
keeps students up to date with events in Eastern Europe, Africa and
other parts of the world.
   Judy Butler, social studies and international education
specialist for the Arkansas Department of Education in Little Rock,
said students appear too nonchalant about the move toward democracy
in the Soviet bloc. She points to her own 15-year-old son as an
example.
   ``For him, it's just the nightly news,'' said Ms. Butler. ``He's
probably more aware of current events than most people because of
his mother. It's like `Oh, that's interesting,' but he doesn't race
to the television like we do. I don't see that voraciousness.
   ``I still don't think they have a full grasp of what it means.
For people my age that grew up with the red scare ... It's things
we've talked about for years but it's like hard to face.''
   Ms. Butler said Arkansas had two Japanese internment camps
during World War II, yet ``the kids don't understand why there is
fear with reunification of Germany.''
   Part of the reason for American students' indifference is their
lack of knowledge about geography and social studies. A recent
study by the congressionally mandated National Assessment of
Educational Progress said that while 85 percent of high school
seniors recognized the Soviet Union on a world map, only 37 percent
could find Southeast Asia. The best score on the entire test was 59
percent.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, bemoaned the indifference and ignorance of American
students ``whose future is now freer of the constant menace of war
between two superpowers.''
   In a newspaper column, Shanker wrote about an honors history
class that was discussing the plight of satellite countries
struggling to free themselves from Soviet domination. One student
asked if ``this talk of satellites'' had anything to do with
``satellite dishes,'' Shanker said.
   Leslie Jean Roche of Wheaton High School in a Maryland suburb
searches for creative ways to teach.
   For example, last Halloween, before the Berlin Wall fell, Ms.
Roche dressed as an ``Eastern Bloc Buster,'' complete with a green
dollar sign painted on one cheek and a symbol representing a ballot
box on the other cheek.
   ``This provoked discussion,'' she said. ``I asked the students
to interpret me based on what was going on. I asked them if the
issues motivating the changes that were just beginning to occur
were economic or political.
   ``They were quite capable of understanding what was going on. It
interested them more than the Jacksonian Democracy that we were
studying.''
   Ms. Roche said she cried about the Berlin Wall because ``it's
such a vivid part of my memory. I remember the bomb drills. I got
the students to hide under their desks and asked them what they
were worried about, to describe their emotions.''
   ``Not only the students but the teachers are in the proces of
learning,'' she said.
   Ms. Hillestad acknowledged that ``I'm not focusing on this as I
should'' because ``I need to feel like I know a little about it. So
I need to do a lot more reading. I would think that a lot of
teachers would be uncomfortable with it. Other than world history,
I don't have a real strong background in that part of the world.''
   Nancy Nemchik, librarian at the Kenmore Middle School in
Landover, Md., said many of the teachers ``had to go back and do
some work to determine where those countries were located'' in
Eastern Europe because ``it wasn't part of the curriculum.''
   A number of states are beefing up their studies in history,
geography and social studies. Ms. Butler said Arkansas elementary
schools focus mainly on general skills that include location of
places in the world, the role of leaders, necessary laws and
responsibilities that go with the law. Middle school children learn
more about current events.
   Global studies are required in high school and teachers are
encouraged to focus on themes like values, culture, conflicts,
world hunger and population problems.
   ``For us to be a basically agricultural state, global studies
has really caught on real well,'' said Ms. Butler.
   Other teachers point to the heavy curricular requirements either
on the state or local level as roadblocks to teachers who want to
deviate some to teach about the current events. Any delays could
put teachers behind schedule.
   Keith Crawley, social studies specialist with the Arizona
Department of Education, said the state began about two years ago
what is called ``essential skills'' for all students. But he
admitted ``most teachers are struggling'' with the concept to
select turning points in history to study in depth.
   ``It's difficult because people in history are used to a
chronological sequence. The teachers have to come to grips with the
idea that events don't come about unless other things come to bear.
But we're excited in Arizona becasue of the new framework,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Eight Try To Trade Congress for Top Title in Statehouse</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight members of Congress are trying to prove
this year that you can go home again _ as governor.
   Potomac fever rarely goes into remission, but among those
politicians who have had enough of Capitol Hill, an increasingly
popular career path leads to places like Little Rock, Tallahassee,
Hartford and Montgomery.
   Seven members of Congress won governorships from 1982 to 1989,
about a third of those who tried. Those odds are hardly comparable
to the 98 percent return rate for members of Congress who seek
re-election, but the higher risk hasn't discouraged a crop of eight
new gubernatorial aspirants this year.
   ``You can do more in an afternoon as governor than you can in a
career in Congress,'' said one gubernatorial hopeful, Republican
Rep. John Rowland of Connecticut, attributing the quip to former
Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.
   It is theme sounded often among those hoping to return home.
   Many say they want to take on greater challenges, test their
executive skills, set their own agendas and leave their marks on
education, drug abuse, budgets, the business climate and the
environment.
   ``I've spent the last seven years pushing and pulling, trying to
get the federal government to deal with its deficit. It's a very
difficult process,'' said Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison, another
Connecticut gubernatorial hopeful. ``The federal government has
lost its capacity to really be the source of solutions to many
problems.''
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who
wrote a book about the American governorship, calls Congress ``an
increasingly depressing place to work.''
   ``The budget deficit is a permanent excuse for inaction.
Democrats and many Republicans are frustrated. The money isn't
there to do what they want to do, and the will to raise taxes isn't
there,'' Sabato said.
   In contrast, he said, ``the states have both the resources and
the will to innovate. Being in a state capitol is much more
invigorating than it was 25 years ago.''
   The desire to head home to the statehouse may run even deeper in
Congress than what is apparent on the surface.
   ``For everyone that runs for governor out of Congress, there is
generally a substantial number greater than that who are thinking
about it, particularly in the off-years,'' said Rep. Joseph
Brennan, a Maine Democrat who is trying to reclaim his old job as
governor. ``Many people here, if they had a choice, would prefer to
be the chief executive of a state.''
   Members of Congress cite career advancement and personal
fulfullment as primary reasons to return to the statehouse. But
they also see the move as a chance to escape the pressures they
face in Congress from constant travel, continuous fund-raising and
little time for family.
   ``The pace and the back and forth and the commitments are a
hardship on any family, but it's even worse on a young family,''
said Rowland, who has children aged 5, 3 and 1 who live in
Connecticut.
   Roots are another element of the pull towards home. Rowland, for
instance, said his family has lived in Connecticut for 150 years.
   Democratic Rep. Ronnie Flippo, hoping to become governor of
Alabama, tells home state audiences he can't get used to ``a place
that serves their tea hot and their green beans cold.''
   Other members of Congress running for governor this year are
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of California and Reps. Bill Nelson,
D-Fla.; Tommy Robinson, R-Ark.; and Wes Watkins, D-Okla.
   At least two more members are eyeing other state jobs as
potential stepping stones.
   Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire is retiring
from the Senate and considering a run for a $100-a-year job in the
part-time state Senate while he awaits a shot at the governorship.
That won't be until his friend, Republican Gov. Judd Gregg, decides
to retire, which might not be until 1996.
   Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, considered a gubernatorial bid this
year and opted to try for lieutenant governor on a ticket with
former Cleveland mayor George Voinovich.
   DeWine, whose family moved back to Ohio last year, would take a
pay cut from $96,600 to $51,000 if the GOP ticket wins. The
tradeoff, he said, is ``a greater opportunity to get things done.''
He'll also have a statewide organization to activate when it's his
turn to run for governor or senator.

<HEAD>Medley of Circumstances Contribute to U.S. Bond Market's Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International investors have many motivations
for backing U.S. government bonds. Sometimes single factors, such
as the sheer size of the huge American market, are enough to steer
money into the United States.
   Yield, or the return on a bond, is among the first
considerations for globally minded investors in deciding where to
put their funds. Inflation rates rank high because no one wants to
watch the worth of a fixed-income investment eroded by rising
prices. Currency values also are crucial.
   ``It's more of a stew of events rather than one main course that
we can sink our teeth into,'' said Robert Brusca, an economist at
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   The relative importance of the reasons to favor one country's
bonds over another's are constantly adjusted depending on world
economic and political events.
   When the U.S. bond market benefited this past week from a modest
``flight to quality,'' investors were focusing on the dollar's
recent strenth and the outlook for further appreciation, especially
against the Japanese yen.
   A profound slump on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has chipped away
value of the once rock-hard yen. The failure of the yen to regain
any ground against the dollar despite a one percentage point
interest rate increase by the Bank of Japan last Tuesday reinforced
the pessimistic attitude toward the yen.
   ``People are adverse to buying yen-denominated bonds because the
currency is dropping,'' said economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. ``The interest rates might
appear attractive but receiving returns in depreciated yen is not.''
   Brusca said Japan's stock market dwarfs its bond market, the
opposite of the U.S. situation. The vast sums pulled out of stocks
cannot be absorbed fully by the Japanese bond market.
   ``When the stock market goes bad that's a real problem,'' he
said. ``Money seems to be migrating out of Tokyo.''
   Platt said Japanese are buying bonds denominated in dollars or
West German marks.
   West German bonds are in favor because unification with East
Germany is expected to bolster the mark. It is anticipated that
ultimately German unity will contributed to faster economic
activity there, leading to higher interest rates. The risk that
rapid growth will spur inflation has curbed some of the enthusiasm
for mark-based investments.
   The U.S. bond market, by far the world's biggest, historically
has been a haven for investors looking for stability and lower
risk. Its size creates the ability to absorb funds without a hiccup
that could unsettle prices.
   Investors wanting to play their investment decisions close to
their chests often prefer the anonymity that a large market
affords. There's less chance of noticing a large influx of cash
into the United States than into Italy, for example.
   The U.S. bond market is estimated to be twice the size of the
next biggest market. According to the report ``How Big is the World
Bond Market'' by Salomon Brothers Inc., the top five bond markets
in terms of 1988 capitalization were: the United States, $4.5
trillion; Japan, $2.2 trillion; West Germany, $753.5 billion;
Italy, $53 billion; and Britain, $34 billion.
   William Brachfeld, an executive vice president at aiwa
Securities Inc., said a country like Japan with a giant trade
surplus has more capital that the country itself can handle. The
capital represents the money flowing into Japan to pay for the
country's exports of merchandise and services.
   ``All those funds are not needed in Japan _ they have to be
invested abroad,'' Brachfeld said. ``A considerable portion of
funds come here because they almost have to come here, there's
almost no place else to put them.''

<HEAD>Hectic Week Teaches Tokyo Traders That Every Bubble Must Burst</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a hectic week of pessimism and repeated plunges
shaved more than 6.9 percent off the main index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the message to traders was clear: Every bubble must burst.
   ``Over the past few years the stock market in this country has
been a repetition of share prices going up because of buying, and
buying because of share prices going up,'' said an editorial in the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an influential economic journal.
   ``As excessive price-earnings ratios indicate, share prices have
been detached from actual industrial conditions, and the bubble has
grown larger and larger. But every bubble must burst,'' the
editorial said Friday. ``That time has come.''
   The Nikkei Stock Average closed the week Friday at 30,372.16
points, down a combined 2,773.1 points during the three previous
trading days.
   After closing for a national holiday Wednesday, the market on
Thursday fell below the psychological 30,000-point barrier. The
225-issue Nikkei index closed Thursday at 29,843.34, its lowest
finish since 29,741.28 on Dec. 24, 1988.
   That put the Nikkei, which rose 8,756.87 points in 1989, down
9,072.93 points, or 23 percent, for the year.
   But by week's end there were buyers in the market. On Thursday,
the Nikkei had been down by nearly 1,900 points at one time but
rebounded to finish only 963 points below the previous close. On
Friday, the market rose 528.82 points, or 1.77 percent.
   ``The bottom is almost here,'' said Kenji Maeshiro, a stock
analyst with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   The week's plunges prompted Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
to lament that his ministry was monitoring the markets ``with
anguish.'' Both he and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno agreed
that the stock and currency markets were driving each other down.
   Seeking to avert inflation and stabilize the financial markets,
Mieno on Tuesday announced a long-awaited hike in Japan's discount
rate, boosting it by 1 percentage point to 5.25 percent.
   Mieno said results from the increase should not be expected to
appear immediately. The increase failed to stop the rise of the
dollar, which gained 2.87 yen over the last six trading days.
   Although Friday's rebound in the Nikkei hinted at confidence
returning to the market, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry began action to assess the effects of the losses so far.
   MITI decided to launch a nationwide survey to gauge the impact
on companies' investment in equipment and facilities, profits, and
prices of imported raw materials, said a ministry official.
   The ministry action came as Mazda, a leading automaker,
reportedly decided to scale back sales targets for a new luxury car
because of fears the bearish market and weak yen might spill over
and dampen consumer extravagance in general.
   ``As far as I know, this is the first such survey by MITI,''
said the official, requesting anonymity. ``But this does not mean
we think the situation very serious. We worry, rather, that our
moves might accelerate the public anxiety and worsen their economic
prospects for the future, so we are trying not to make a fuss about
it.''
   After Friday's rally, some traders also expressed confidence in
a recovery, pointing out that investors may seek the buy
opportunites created by major falls.
   ``The market is slowly but gradually recovering, helped by
relative stability in the currency and bond markets,'' said Akira
Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   He said the market would be helped by the Finance Ministry's
approval Thursday of a measure that allows Japan's four major
brokerage houses to handle more than 30 percent of the purchase
orders of any particular stock in a month.
   Japan's four major securities firms _ Nomura Securitiies, Daiwa
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities _ had asked
the Finance Ministry to ease the restriction, a rule intended to
curb insider trading.
   The four securities firms account for about half of the market's
total trading volume, a market analyst said.
   Securities companies, meanwhile, have decided not to underwrite
new stock, bond and warrant issues so that available funds instead
would go toward bolstering prices of existing stocks.
   At least nine companies recently canceled plans to issue new
stock shares because of concern over the fluctuations in stock
prices and the Nikkei's sharp declines.
   Nevertheless, concern remained that money that had been flowing
into stocks could still be diverted elsewhere because of the
market's perceived instability.

   Fiat SpA has agreed to expand its joint auto
venture with the Soviet Union to include the manufacture of engines
and transmissions for the entire projected annual production of
cars at the Yelabuga plant outside Moscow, a Fiat spokesman said
Friday.
   As a result, Fiat will roughly triple the amount of engines and
parts to be manufactured at the joint-venture plant, the spokesman
said.
   Under terms of the initial agreement, Fiat agreed to provide
machinery and parts for the annual production of 300,000 A-93
mid-size cars starting in late 1993 or 1994. The Soviets were to
furnish the engines and transmissions for the remaining two-thirds
of total annual production.
   The joint-venture agreement was signed last fall during Soviet
President Mikail Gorbachev's visit to Italy.
   This week, a visiting delegation of Soviet officials asked Fiat
also to provide machinery for an additional 600,000 cars a year at
the plant, the Fiat spokesman said. These will be sub-compacts and
upscale models.
   The Soviet delegation visited Fiat plants and viewed a model of
the A-93 to be produced at Yelabuga.
   The A-93 is a small sedan based on Fiat's popular Panda model.

   The 25th floor of the south tower of the
luxurious World Financial Center is empty save for a few boxes. So
are the 26th, 27th and 28th floors.
   In the booming mid-1980s, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. expected to fill
the space easily. The nation's largest securities firm booked two
full towers in the ultra-modern complex in lower Manhattan that
opened in 1986, using conservative estimates of employment growth.
   Then Merrill scaled back to one tower plus about half the
second. After the 1987 stock market crash even that was too much,
and now the firm plans to sublet nine floors, including the four
undeveloped ones.
   On Wall Street _ and Broad Street and Greenwich Street and
Battery Place _ a securities industry recession has created an
office-space glut in the world's premier financial district.
   Vacancy rates are soaring in the maze of silver office towers
and aging stone monoliths where stock trading began almost 200
years ago under a buttonwood tree. Property brokers compare the
slump to the mid-1970s, when New York teetered on bankruptcy.
   ``We're still headed south,'' said Robert F.R. Ballard, an
executive vice president with the real estate firm Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, who has worked in the Wall Street building market since
1959. ``We haven't bottomed out yet.''
   Manhattan real estate brokers say the vacancy rate in the
downtown financial district is approaching 20 percent, vs. 8
percent to 12 percent in 1985 during the securities industry boom.
   Put another way, the 14 million square feet of available office
space downtown equals three empty buildings, each as big as a
110-story World Trade Center tower.
   The glut is expected to worsen because hundreds of thousands of
square feet to be abandoned by firms such as Merrill, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., Salomon Inc. and collapsed Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. haven't been tallied yet.
   Unprecedented growth in stock trading and investment banking
gave rise to hand-over-fist hiring and expansion by Wall Street
firms in the 1980s.
   Average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange shot
up from 32.2 million shares in 1979 to 189 million shares in 1987,
while employment in in New York's securities and commodities
industries grew from 74,000 to 163,000.
   During that period, Wall Street firms set ambitious expansion
plans, tied to the seemingly limitless possibilities of another
boom. Building ``world headquarters'' seemed logical to accomodate
technological advances that required more space for more computers
for more trading into the 21st century.
   ``Many of the financial firms don't indulge in what we call
intelligent strategic planning regarding their space needs,'' said
Joel Wechsler, a managing director of the real estate firm Edward
S. Gordon &amp; Co. ``They're getting a little more sophisticated in
that area now.''
   Stock market volume, securities underwriting, mergers and
takeovers and other financial businesses are down sharply. Since
the crash, the securities industry has lost more than 40,000 jobs.
   ``The vacancy rates are directly related to the shrinkage in the
financial services industry,'' said Anthony M. Saytanides, Edward
S. Gordon's chief operating officer.
   Ballard put it less gently: ``The developers built too much
space. The tenants rented too much space. The market took a
nosedive.''
   During the decline, several projects were abandoned and other
overly ambitious ones have cost firms hundreds of millions of
dollars. Salomon took a $150 million accounting charge against
earnings after dropping out of a major project. Two firms that
named buildings for themselves _ E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. and Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. _ are history.
   Shearson, the No. 2 brokerage behind Merrill, spent $450 million
to build a 39-story office tower known as Shearson Lehman Hutton
Plaza. The firm plans to fill the building, which opened late last
year, but also is firing up to 5,000 workers this year, which could
lead to more unused space.
   Workers in reduced Shearson departments say they can roam floors
almost undisturbed. The firm's new tower is adorned with a
Parthenon-like frieze, and some wags say it too could wind up a
monument to a golden age.
   ``There may be some discussion in hindsight whether it was the
most effective use of the firm's money at the time,'' a Shearson
official privately conceded, adding that it is evaluating space
needs as part of an overhaul.
   Merrill decided to move in the early '80s, when its headcount
was growing by 13 percent annually. It booked the World Financial
Center space anticipating only half that growth. But since the
crash, Merrill has slashed its work force back to a 1980 level.
More cuts are planned.
   The firm took a $470 million charge against earnings last
quarter for its restructuring _ $220 million to cover real estate
commitments, nearly all of that in New York.
   ``The growth has certainly gone in the other direction,''
Merrill spokesman Fred Yager said. ``Our fixed costs have been
reduced considerably and one of our biggest fixed costs is real
estate.''
   For the real estate market, the glut's the thing. While modern
office spaces such as the World Financial Center and World Trade
Center complexes are almost fully occupied, older buildings are
bearing the brunt as firms move out.
   The average asking rent downtown is falling, but not in
proportion to available space. Brokers say top-line offices still
command around $35 per square foot, among the highest in the
country. Some prices for older buildings, though, have fallen into
the single digits, just like in the 1970s.
   Brokers estimate the downtown vacancy rate will climb well above
20 percent once a rash of moves _ some across New York waterways to
cheaper Brooklyn or New Jersey _ are completed. In the mid-'70s,
the rate was about 25 percent, brokers said.
   Among the untallied moves: the Securities Industry Automation
Corp.'s move to new quarters, abandoning 200,000 square feet;
Salomon's shift to 7 World Trade Center, leaving 500,000 square
feet behind; the consolidation by Merrill and Shearson; and about
1.5 million square feet by Drexel.
   During its junk-bond driven heyday, Drexel planned to build new
headquarters downtown. The firm wisely scrapped the project after
settling securities fraud charges with the government last April
and trimming 4,000 employees by selling its retail brokerage
operations.
   Unwisely, in retrospect, Drexel last fall extended the lease on
its main Broad Street offices until 2004. Six weeks ago, Drexel's
parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, listing more than $470
million in domestic lease commitments outstanding.
   Some brokers say the market has even further to fall because at
least one sure sign of desperation has yet to take hold.
   ``During the '70s a lot of the older buildings were turned into
apartments,'' Ballard said. ``That hasn't happened yet, and if that
hasn't happened we haven't hit bottom.''

<HEAD>Some Say Hazelwood Verdict Could Hurt Exxon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Hazelwood's future seemed less murky
after a jury acquitted the skipper of serious charges stemming from
the Alaska oil spill, but lawyers say the verdict may dump more
trouble onto his ex-boss Exxon Corp.
   ``I guess the jurors thought it was Exxon's fault and decided
not make the captain the goat,'' said Melvin Belli, a celebrity
attorney famous for winning multimillion-dollar judgments, who
represents 500 clients suing Exxon.
   ``It won't hurt my case at all,'' he said in a telephone
interview after the Hazelwood verdict was announced this past week.
``It might help my case. They let the captain off. Now let's get
the people who are really responsible.''
   The captain of the Exxon Valdez tanker that hit a reef a year
ago and spewed oil into Prince William Sound was convicted of only
a simple misdemeanor count of negligence for his role in the
nation's worst oil spill. He was sentenced to help clean up the
mess and pay $50,000 in restitution.
   Jurors at a trial in Anchorage, Alaska, said there wasn't enough
evidence to convict him on the more substantial counts of criminal
mischief, reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while drunk.
   The verdict stunned much of the nation, including attorneys who
said the lynch-mob atmosphere created by the oil spill had made
convictions seem a foregone conclusion.
   Exxon, which fired Hazelwood after the disaster, said it was
pleased his ordeal was over and that the verdict suggested the
grounding was an accident. Hazelwood even said he would try to
renegotiate his old job back.
   But specialists in corporate liability law said Hazelwood's
conviction on the negligence charge might be bad news for Exxon,
because it could be used by the hundreds of plaintiffs suing the
company for civil damages as solid evidence that the company,
through one of its employees, was to blame.
   Some also suggested that the jury's failure to convict on the
more serious charges didn't mean they wouldn't be raised again in
civil litigation, in which the rules of evidence are much less
stringent than in criminal proceedings.
   ``Exxon gets very little benefit out of this,'' said David
Leebron, a professor of corporate liability law at Columbia
University Law School.
   ``Exxon would be responsible for the negligence of its
employees,'' he said. ``They might have been hoping that the
employee did something so unpredictable it would get them out of
liability. So in this case, the jury finding of negligence hurts
them.''
   Belli, whose clients range from Alaskan boatbuilders to Japanese
canneries hurt by a post-spill fishing ban around the Alaskan
coast, said the verdict only strengthened his legal arsenal. He
predicted Exxon would attempt to settle most of the lawsuits.
   ``The damages aren't measured in millions,'' he said. ``They're
in billions.''
   Daniel D. Polsby, a professor of law at Northwestern University
in Chicago, speculated that the Hazelwood verdict would shift the
focus of litigation away from who was responsible. Now, he said,
``the question is going to be who has got a right to complain.''
   That could mean many years of tangled lawsuits and questions
over who was hurt financially by the spill and what will be
required to clean it up. Exxon already has spent about $2 billion
in a cleanup, but its future liability is undetermined.
   Some lawyers suggested Exxon also faces the tricky problem of
whether to rehire Hazelwood. He was dismissed for violating company
policy after post-spill tests revealed he had been legally drunk.
But the jury said the evidence wasn't there to back that up.
   Andrew Kramer, chairman of the labor section at the law firm
Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, said if Exxon rehired Hazelwood, it
might undermine the company's contention that the skipper acted
irresponsibly.
   On the other hand, Kramer said, Exxon executives might reason
that ``if we don't rehire him, he is a potential witness against
us.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience store
operator, agreed to sell control to a Japanese company because of
crushing debt burdens stemming from a junk-bond-financed buyout.
The deal announced by the founder of the 7-Eleven chain was one of
the most dramatic examples of credit crises faced by U.S. companies
that have relied heavily on junk financing.
   _President Bush's savings &amp; loan bailout plan hit a potentially
crippling snag when a judge prevented a government takeover of an
ailing Chicago thrift on grounds that federal regulators in charge
of the bailout were appointed unconstitutionally. An appeals court
temporarily blocked the order and Bush moved to blunt it as well by
nominating a new thrift-office director to be confirmed by the
Senate.
   _Japan's mighty financial markets plunged, bolstering the view
that what goes up must come down. But the decline had a limited
impact on U.S. stock prices, reviving the question of whether the
globalization of securities trading is as important as earlier
believed.

<HEAD>Bull Market Could Be Driven Out as Quarter Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like Arturo Di Modica's renegade bull statue,
Wall Street's latest bull market may soon be driven away, at least
for a while.
   After a vigorous runup recently, the market rally stalled this
past Tuesday as traders fretted about corporate earnings at home
and interest rates in Japan. Stocks recovered on Friday, boosted by
strong bond prices and a mild rebound on the troubled Tokyo stock
market.
   Strategists expect the first-quarter earnings of many U.S.
companies, due early next month, to show worse-than-expected
results that would depress the value of American stocks.
   The earnings reports ``will look pretty horrendous,'' said Larry
Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   In addition, as the first quarter approaches its end this coming
week, many institutional investors could sell to take profits to
put on their books.
   Rumblings from the Far East could heighten the market's
skittishness.
   For the past month or so, steep declines in the Tokyo stock
market have failed to shake up Wall Street _ at least not too much.
The familiar domino effect from one market to the other seems to
have been put on hold.
   But the effect could come roaring back, some experts believe, if
the Tokyo market falls so severely that Japanese investors are
forced to sell their U.S. stocks to raise cash for obligations at
home.
   ``We may run into some rough sledding,'' said Bill Raftery, an
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``That's where the
selling pressure could come in.''
   Much will depend on the dollar. Its strength has helped fuel the
market's recent rally.
   The dollar's gains are seen as a testimony to the stability and
favorable long-term prospects of the U.S. economy, at a time when
the world political and economic landscape is changing fast.
   But a downturn in the currency could prompt Wall Street to throw
out the bull even more vehemently.
   The bull statue, by the way, was hauled away from the front of
the New York Stock Exchange in mid-December after standing there
less than a day. Di Modica, its sculptor, said he was donating
``The Charging Bull'' to the city as a Christmas present, but the
exchange couldn't bear having it there.
   The irrepressible bronze bull later resurfaced at Bowling Green,
not far from Wall Street, in view of the federal bankruptcy court.
The city told Di Modica he could sell the three-ton statue to a
company, which could then donate it to New York.
   The bull market also is expected to come back, after a period of
what strategists call ``consolidation''.
   ``This economy is showing surprising pockets of strength,'' said
Frank Cappiello, a principal of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello
Inc. in Baltimore. ``People see this as a market of preference.''
   Di Modica agrees.
   ``The economy is strong and will get stronger. I would never be
negative about that,'' he said from his studio in lower Manhattan.
   For the week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 36.94
points to 2,704.28.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 2.47 to
185.45; the NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter trading lost
4.91 to 437.25, and the American Stock Exchange's market value
index dropped 2.57 to 361.61.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 151.72 million shares a day,
compared with 159.84 million the week before.

<HEAD>Spanish-Language Magazine Launched in Conjunction with TV Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ambitious multimedia effort aimed at
Hispanics gets underway Monday, enabling advertisers to reach the
nation's fast-growing Spanish-speaking market by magazine,
television and telephone.
   Creators of the service say 90 percent of the $10 million in
annual ad time and space has been sold. Media analysts and
competitors said the service could draw renewed attention to the
Spanish-language market.
   Some media and advertising executives have argued that U.S.
advertisers are missing a profitable opportunity by failing to
spend more on reaching the 20 million-plus Hispanics in the United
States in their native language.
   ``We frankly welcome this competition because we want to make
Spanish print media better known and accepted,'' said Alberto Abdo,
a marketing executive with Miami-based America Publishing Group, a
leading Spanish-language publisher with 16 magazines sold in the
United States.
   The new multimedia service will reach an estimated 500,000
Hispanic magazine readers and nearly 90 percent of Hispanic homes
with television, says its developer, Whittle Communications of
Knoxville, Tenn.
   Starting later this spring, advertisers will also be mentioned
when operators answer calls to a toll-free telephone service for
Hispanics seeking information on topics ranging from recipes to
immigration. The operator will answer calls by saying the hotline
service is ``brought to you by ...''
   Among the sponsors who are paying $500,000 a year under two-year
contracts for a basic package that includes television and
telephone time and space in the magazine are American Airlines,
Procter &amp; Gamble, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Kinney Shoes.
   The conerstone of the service is the magazine La Familia de Hoy,
published every other month. It is distributed free to 10,500
medical waiting rooms and beauty parlors in Hispanic neigborhoods
in 45 markets.
   Whittle executives said the magazine will offer information that
can help Hispanics live better in the United States.
   That is a big break from other Spanish-language magazines
circulated here that often rely mainly on ``gossip, entertainment
and fashion,'' said editor Patricia Duarte.
   The March-April issue has stories on recognizing when your
children may be abusing drugs and what to do about it, handling
finances, cooking tips, relating to your spouse and staying
healthy. It also has a profile of President Bush's daughter-in-law,
Colomba Bush, who is from Mexico.
   Whittle is also producing two-minute informational programs that
will run 31 times a week on the Spanish-language television network
Univision, which reaches 6.4 million Spanish-speaking households in
the United States.
   Each program will identify the sponsor at the start and finish
and include a commercial of 30 to 45 seconds. Many of the programs
will be drawn from subjects covered in the magazine.
   A typical program starts with an introduction by former
Univision Network News anchor Teresa Rodriguez. After the
commercial, an expert may discuss a topic, often leaving a number
or address for more information.
   In one program, a physician offers health tips for pregnant
women; in another, Ms. Rodriguez toured a museum designed for
children.
   F. Ashley Shomaker, who is overseesing the project for Whittle,
said advertisers are also being mentioned at other times of the day
on the Univision network to draw attention to upcoming shows.
Advertisers will also be rotated regularly on the telephone
announcement.
   Richard Hamilton, an advertising executive with D'Arcy Masius,
Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, said marketers are starting to pay
more attention to the Hispanic market because it is growing rapidly
in size, per capita income and willingness to buy recognized brands.
   He said they are turning to Spanish-language media because
research indicates ``many Hispanics prefer communications in
Spanish'' to English.
   But America Publishing's Abdo said that while Hispanics make up
nearly 10 percent of the U.S. population, advertisers spend less
than 1 percent of their ad budgets in Spanish-language media.
   ``They spend mostly on TV. The amounts dedicated to print are
very low,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he said ad pages at his company's magazines are up
36 percent this year from a year ago. He credited more aggressive
marketing and greater awareness among advertisers of the market's
potential.

<HEAD>Winnebago Industries Reports Widening Loss, Discloses Credit
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnebago Industries Inc. reported
Friday that its losses more than doubled in the second quarter of
its fiscal year and disclosed problems arranging credit with banks
and financial institutions.
   The $5.3 million loss in the quarter ended Feb. 24 reflected a
weak market for motor homes, losses from a new division that makes
trucks for delivery businesses and continued losses from its
Cycle-Sat subsidiary that delivers commercials to television
stations by satellite.
   Frank Rolfes, who follows Winnebago for the Minneapolis
securities firm of Dain Bosworth, said the results were in line
with his projections, ``which are very negative.''
   ``They're not doing very well down there,'' he said. ``It
doesn't appear to be getting better.''
   On Wall Street, the report appeared to be shrugged off as the
New York Stock Exchange-listed Winnebago ended the day unchanged at
$5.25 a share.
   John K. Hanson, the founder and chairman of the Forest City
manufacturer, said recent negotiations with the company's banks and
financial institutions failed to achieve ``acceptable'' credit
terms.
   ``As a result, Winnebago has reduced its outstanding short-term
borrowing through the liquidation of the company's marketable
securities portfolio and sale of Winnebago Acceptance Corporation's
dealer receivables,'' Hanson said.
   Winnebago Acceptance Corp. provides financing to buyers of its
motor homes and recreational vehicles. Its receivables are the loan
agreements it holds.
   Spokeswoman Sheila Davis said the company had sold its entire
securities portfolio.
   The company did not release its securities losses or put a value
on the securities sold. But Ms. Davis said that at the end of its
first fiscal quarter Winnebago had $30.6 million in cash and
securities.
   Rolfes said he did not believe the company was in danger of
collapse because it has little long-term debt, but added, ``they've
got to do something to turn things around.''
   In its annual report, the company listed total short-term debt
of about $5.7 million and long-term debt of $6.4 million as of Aug.
26, 1989.
   Rolfes said Winnebago had been losing money on its securities
portfolio for years and may have decided it was putting that
investment to better use by buying down its short-term debt to
reduce interest expenses.
   The $5.3 million loss in the second quarter of the fiscal year
came to 21 cents a share and compared with a loss of almost $2.6
million, or 10 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Revenue for the period fell almost 25 percent to $80.6 million from
$107.1 million.
   ``The results for the quarter were caused by losses in RV
operations due to lower motor home sales volume, substantial
inventive and promotion costs, a shift in product mix to lower
priced motor homes, and continuing losses by Winnebago subsidiary,
Cycle-Sat, start-up costs for the commercial vehicle division and
losses in financial investments,'' Hanson said.
   For the first half of the fiscal year, Winnebago reported a loss
of nearly $10 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with a profit
of $6.3 million, or 25 cents a share, in the same period a year
earlier. Revenue fell by 32 percent to $159.6 million from $235.1
million.

<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. said Friday it has
received $125 million from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and
its former regional operating companies as part of a settlement of
an 8-year-old antitrust lawsuit.
   Chris Schildz, a spokesman for the St. Louis-based defense
contractor, said it was not clear exactly what effect the
settlement will have on earnings, but that it is likely the
after-tax benefit would be less than $2 a share.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Chicago in 1982, claimed
that AT&amp;T acted to prevent competitors from making and selling
phone equipment from 1972 to 1980 by using ``illegal'' and
anticompetitive'' activities.
   At the time, General Dynamics owned General Dynamics Telephone
Systems Center, formerly Stromberg-Carlson Corp., and General
Dynamics Communications Co. The company sold its telecommunications
business in 1982.
   The settlement acknowledges that AT&amp;T and its subsidiaries did
not act in collusion to prevent competition, Schildz said.

   Two Michigan businessmen and three
companies they control pleaded innocent Friday to charges they
bilked a Scott Paper Co. mill out of up to $1 million by bribing an
engineer and putting his wife on their payroll.
   Federal prosecutors say Gerald M. Chernow, 49, and William M.
Engelman, 52, cheated the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook by
persuading maintenance engineer David Hilt to buy unneeded
maintenance and roofing equipment that was marked up by up to 20
times its cost.
   Initially, Hilt was given merchandise, gift certificates and
money orders, and later, his wife, Ellen, was put on the payroll of
one of the Michigan companies, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack
Gleason said.
   Chernow and Engelman, both of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., entered
innocent pleas before U.S. Magistrate David Cohen.
   Chernow and Engelman were freed on their own recognizance, but
they must hand over their passports and will be required to pay
$50,000 bond if they fail to show up to any court proceedings,
Gleason said. The two businessmen had appeared in court without
being arrested.
   The two are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and the use of
interstate facilities in furtherance of private bribery.
   Both businessmen declined to comment on the case, as did defense
attorney Julian Sweet of Lewiston.
   Also named as defendants in the 21-count indictment are Modern
Research Corp. and Lincoln Technical Services Inc., both of Troy,
Mich., and ABC Chemical Co. of Detroit.
   If Chernow and Engelman are convicted on all counts, they face
up to 105 years in prison and fines totaling $5.25 million each,
the prosecutor said. Modern Research and Lincoln Technical Service
each face up to $10.5 million in fines, while ABC Chemical could
face $6.5 million in fines.
   Philadelphia-based Scott Paper lost between $750,000 and $1
million in the scheme, the government says.

<HEAD>Reformulated Gasoline Goes on Sale in Southeastern Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marathon Petroleum Co. will make southeastern
Michigan a test market for a gasoline intended to help meet demands
for reduced air pollution from autos, the company said Friday.
   Marathon will start selling its ``Amaraclean'' gasolines Monday
in three unleaded grades at 161 stations in eight southeastern
Michigan counties.
   If the gasolines sell in the Detroit area, Marathon will start
marketing them sometime next year in other cities such as
Cleveland, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Akron, Ohio, the company said.
   The introduction of cleaner gasolines has followed a proposal by
President Bush last June 5 that would have required selling
millions of cars that run on fuels other than gasoline, such as
natural gas or methanol.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
confirmed last month the Bush administration was telling Senate
leaders that reformulated gasolines might be an acceptable
alternative.
   The compromise clean-air bill being debated in the Senate this
week would require reformulated, cleaner-burning gasolines in the
country's smoggiest cities by 1995, said Charles Gray, head of the
EPA's Ann Arbor testing laboratory.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. already is selling reformulated gasoline
in California. In Denver, Conoco and Shamrock sell gasoline blended
to reduce carbon monoxide emissions.
   Amoco isn't marketing a reformulated gasoline yet but that ``is
a major consideration among the alternate fuels that are being
looked at,'' said spokesman Neil Geary in Chicago.
   Geary said oil companies are experimenting with various fuels.
He said Amoco expects within a month to begin test marketing
compressed natural gas at four Denver locations.
   White said motorists probably won't notice any difference in
price or performance with the Amaraclean gasolines.
   But the gasoline will evaporate less easily in hot weather,
cutting down on a major cause of smog.
   The fuels are a step toward reduced volatility levels the EPA
proposes to require for all gasolines by 1992, Gray said.
   The fuel is also formulated to burn more completely, and
cancer-causing chemicals normally used to boost octane have been
eliminated. Marathon said the blends cut hydrocarbon emissions
about 20 percent and carbon monoxide 14 percent.
