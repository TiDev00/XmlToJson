   A huge fire broke out at Universal
Studios movie lot Tuesday night, burning an unknown number of
buildings, a fire official said.
   It was not known if the fire, reported at 7:18 p.m., threatened
any lives, said a Los Angeles County fire spokesman Pat Marek.
   The fire broke out in a sound stage area at the rear of the
studio lot, Marek said. At least 18 engines were sent to the blaze.

   Lalo, a bomb maker with one
arm, pressed a whittled, foil-sheathed plug through a tube wired to
a flashlight battery and tiny bulb. The bulb went on.
   ``Boom,'' Lalo said softly. ``There goes your foot.''
   The switch is designed to be buried and activated by a soldier's
footstep. It is one of dozens of devices leftist rebels have
improvised to make up for a shortage of commercial weaponry.
   Lalo, whose left arm was blown off by a mine, makes explosives
from various mixtures of nitrogen-rich fertilizer, ground charcoal
from the guarumo tree, powdered aluminum, ammonia, sulfur and
sawdust. For shrapnel, Lalo uses nails, glass, even stones.
   He and his assistant, Jorge, fashion their mines and mortar
shells on this extinct volcano 15 miles north of San Salvador with
the rudimentary tools of a traveling tinker.
   ``Everything we make is a copy of industrially manufactured
weapons,'' Lalo said.
   Five years ago, he lost his arm to the explosion of a homemade
mine he was digging up for relocation.
   ``Every amorer makes two mistakes,'' he told an interviewer,
stripping wire with his teeth: ``The first, when he gets into this
line of work; the second, when he gets creamed.''
   Details of government casualties are classified, but foreign
military attaches say homemade mines wounded more soldiers than
rifle fire in the 1980s.
   The most common guerrilla mine is the ``quita-pie,'' literally
``foot-taker.'' It is designed to maim rather than kill, and its
components cost about $2.
   Congress voted in October to halve U.S. military aid to El
Salvador, originally set at $85 million for the year.
   While Defense Minister Rene Emilo Ponce lamented the effect on
logistics and operations, Lalo and his colleagues were making bombs
of what seemed little more than chewing gum, baling wire, sticks
and spit.
   More than $1 billion in U.S. military aid in the 1980s swelled
the armed forces from 12,000 to 56,000 men and gave them
sophisticated weapons, including jet fighter-bombers, helicopters
and artillery.
   Rebel ranks are believed to have about 7,000 full-time
combatants and roughly the same number of militia fighters.
   They have received some arms, mainly assault rifles and
ammunition, from Cuba and Nicaragua since the civil war began in
late 1979, but generally rely on the black market and their own
ingenuity.
   Included in the arsenal are 35-pound bombs made from refillable
tanks of the propane gas Salvadoran workers use as cooking fuel. A
dozen such bombs, launched like mortar rounds from barrel-sized
pipes, were among projectiles that rained on the main air force
base in an attack Oct. 17.
   Guerrilla arms makers are scavengers who utilize what the enemy
throws away or inadvertently bestows.
   Bomb casings are made from ration cans discarded by army
patrols. Lalo has extracted as much as 200 pounds of Tritonal high
explosive from U.S.-supplied 500 lb. bombs that did not explode
when dropped on the slopes of Guazapa.
   Like Lalo and his arms makers, guerrilla doctors also
demonstrate great ingenuity.
   In 1982-83, the rebels on Guazapa were decimated by a malaria
epidemic. Pharmaceutcal quinine was almost impossible to obtain
because of government offensives.
   The doctors extracted the alkaloid from the bark of the cinchona
tree, mixed it with cornmeal and sugar and pressed it into pills.
By early 1984, the disease was under control.
   Agusto, one of the doctors, recalled operating with a razor
blade and tweezers for lack of surgical implements. He learned to
modify a disposable syringe for tracheotomies and used the severed
fingers of rubber gloves to drain wounds of pus and blood.
   ``I've done several amputations with the saw blade of a Swiss
army knife,'' he said.
   Folk medicine based on herbs, sap, roots and bark is a mainstay.
   During the early 1980s, when their positions on and around
Guazapa were less stable and lines of supply more tenuous, rebels
recruited the local bootlegger to distill cane liquor into
hospital-grade alcohol.

<DATELINE>DHEISHE CAMP, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electrician Sami
Kanouneh is one of thousands of Palestinians who have become
economic casualties of rising Arab-Israeli violence.
   The Jewish contractor who had employed Kanouneh for the past 12
years fired him on Oct. 29.
   ``He was fed up with strikes, curfews and the army closing the
roads,'' Kanouneh said in an interview in this refugee camp south
of Jerusalem. ``And, I think, he was afraid.''
   A wave of stabbing attacks by Palestinians and Israelis since
mid-October was the last straw in labor tensions built up during
the 34-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Arab stabbings of Israelis and counterattacks by Jews
followed the Oct. 8 slayings of 20 Palestinians by police on
Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Five people have died and more than a
dozen have been wounded in revenge attacks.
   No official figures exist on how many Palestinians have been
laid off since the latest Arab-Jewish violence began.
   But Israeli newspapers have carried almost daily reports of
Palestinian firings. They include the cleaning crew at a big Tel
Aviv shopping mall, construction workers at a nearby bus terminal,
textile mill employees in southern Dimona and restaurant workers in
Jerusalem.
   Shaher Saed, secretary-general of the West Bank trade union
federation, estimates that 9,000 of the 110,000 Palestinians
employed in Israel have lost their jobs since the Temple Mount
riot.
   Israel's Employment Service reported 10,000 requests for workers
during a five-day army closure of the occupied territories to
prevent Arab attacks. That is seven times more than normal, said
Benny Schwartz of the service.
   The layoffs couldn't come at a worse time for the 1.7 million
Palestinians living in lands seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   They already faced new competition for jobs from the thousands
of Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel. The 120-store Co-op Blue
Square supermarket chain has replaced its Arab cleaning crews with
Soviets, company officials said.
   And Palestinians can't turn to the occupied lands for work.
   Israeli restrictions on industry and a lack of investment in the
territories have left the Arabs with few factories - neither basic
industries such as steel and cement, nor high-tech ones such as
electronics.
   The West Bank Data Project, an Israeli think tank headed by
former Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Meron Benvenisti, accuses Israel of
systematically blocking development in the territories.
   The goal has been to keep Palestinians as a cheap and captive
labor force and the territories as a ready market for Israeli-made
goods, it concludes.
   Palestinian businessman Charles Shamas says Israel has denied
construction permits, limited imports of raw material, refused
marketing permits and even taxed loans and grants for Palestinian
development.
   ``In general, they will not permit any industry that could
compete with theirs, especially in the export market,'' Shamas
said.
   For Arab workers such as Kanouneh, 28, this means there are few
jobs to replace those lost in Israel.
   ``I've been looking everywhere, but there is no work,'' he said.
A father of six, he has food to buy, utility bills to pay and no
savings to fall back on.
   Many Israeli employers are keeping Arab workers out of loyalty
or to keep paying cheap wages, but the realization that thousands
more might be fired has prompted another look at government
policies on Palestinian labor.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens told a Parliament committee this
week that Israel risks social upheaval if there is a wholesale
firing of Arabs.
   ``What Arens is saying is that the policy of the government
since 1967 was to create job opportunities for Arabs from the
territories in Israel,'' said Arens aide Dan Neveh. ``Now is the
time to start changing this so Israelis will get the opportunities
in Israel and Arabs will find jobs in the territories.''
   Some Palestinians were skeptical that Israel would do anything
to make up for the lost jobs, saying Israelis feared economic
independence would only encourage calls for a Palestinian state.
   Economist Adel Samara from the West Bank town of Ramallah said
the new layoffs could quickly damage the territories' $1.5 billion
economy.
   ``Most workers have no savings,'' he said. ``Their financial
difficulties will be immediate and their lower consumption will
result in further economic stagnation in the territories.''
   And Saed, the trade unionist, said the dismissals of Arabs could
be costly to Israeli businesses.
   ``The average Palestinian construction worker earns 1,200
shekels ($600) a month,'' Saed said. ``An Israeli would demand
double, and he also would get benefits like unemployment insurance
and pension.''
   ``It will be hard to find unemployed Israelis willing to clean
streets, work in bakeries and do other menial jobs that
Palestinians have filled,'' he said.

<HEAD>Leon Fleisher: Virtuoso of Life Written for Left Hand</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pianist Leon Fleisher's tragedy was losing his
right hand to a crippling muscle disorder. His triumph was showing
the world that it hardly mattered.
   After building a new life for himself in the past
quarter-century as a conductor and teacher, Fleisher, 62, returned
to the concert stage last weekend for a bravura piano recital
featuring solo works for the left hand only.
   His homecoming performance in the Kennedy Center's crowded
Terrace Theater was praised by music critics with the same
enthusiasm that greeted his Carnegie Hall debut with the New York
Philharmonic in 1944, when he was a gangly 16-year-old from San
Francisco.
   Several works on Saturday night's program were written for other
great pianists who, like Fleisher, were unable to use their right
hands. They included Russian composer Alexander Scriabin, who
suffered the same ailment as Fleisher, and Viennese pianist Paul
Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in World War I.
   It was Fleisher's first solo recital in a major concert hall
since he was stricken more than 25 years ago.
   When Fleisher withdrew from the concert stage in April 1965, on
the eve of a European tour with the Cleveland Orchestra, his
right-hand fingers had become weak, numb and beyond control.
   Once hailed by The New York Times as ``the finest American
pianist of his (and probably any) time,'' Fleisher was devastated.
   ``I had the sense that my whole world had dropped out from under
me,'' he said. ``My whole life's direction pointed toward the
abyss. For two years, I struggled with, `Why did this happen to
me?' I was wallowing in self-pity.''
   He was rescued by Dina Koston, a former student at the Peabody
Institute in Baltimore, who persuaded him to become co-director and
conductor of the Kennedy Center's resident chamber music ensemble,
the Theater Chamber Players, in 1968.
   ``She came up with a suggestion that took me out of that abyss
and showed me I could still function as a musician,'' Fleisher
said.
   Thus began his resurrection as guest conductor of many of the
world's major symphony orchestras, an opera conductor, associate
conductor of the Baltimore Symphony and artistic director of the
Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, Mass.
   Meanwhile, Fleisher completed 30 years of teaching at Peabody
last spring, and is busy recording the known repertoire of
left-hand piano concertos with the Boston Symphony. He plans to
write his memoirs under the title, ``Eighty-Eight Keys And No
Lock.''
   Doctors have never diagnosed his affliction, which he dismisses
as ``writer's cramp.'' A subsequent bout of carpal tunnel syndrome,
a painful nerve disorder of the wrist and hand which Scriabin and
Robert Schumann also suffered, was cured surgically.
   These ailments are common to professional pianists, typists and
others whose work requires sustained, repetitive wrist motions.
``Man was not created for the computer keyboard or the piano,''
Fleisher said.
   Fleisher said he practiced ``incorrectly, even stupidly,'' for
six to eight hours a day for 20 years until the muscles of his
right hand ``just curled up and said, don't beat on me anymore.''
The damage was irreversible.
   No matter. Fleisher is too busy savoring his rich new life to
waste time fretting over the past.
   ``I've learned a lot,'' he said. ``What you think are the most
important things in the world are not the most important. What's
important are relations with people, nature, the world around us.
That's where it's at.''
   Fleisher said his handicap has ``somehow opened my ears,''
making him a good listener for the first time in his life. He
believes it also has improved his teaching by forcing him to
verbalize his musical concepts, instead of demonstrating them on
the keyboard.
   The ecstasy of conducting has been a revelation, he said.
   He recalled conducting the Boston Symphony in a performance of
Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. ``It took my breath away,'' he said.
``It was like riding the crest of a tidal wave. It was
incredible.''
   He also enjoyed ``some extraordinary moments'' conducting a
community orchestra in Annapolis, Md., whose amateur musicians
``got so caught up that they rose to levels they never knew they
were capable of.''
   Just as he has finally learned to play the piano properly, using
forearms and shoulders rather than hammering away with curled
fingers, Fleisher has become aware of the hazards of such ordinary
objects as doorknobs.
   ``It's a totally unhealthy design,'' he said, curving his
fingers around an imaginary doorknob and twisting his wrist. ``Door
handles are much better.''

   Iraq's elaborate fortifications in Kuwait,
including trenches filled with flammable oil products, are
complicating American military planning, a senior Marine Corps
officer says.
   Gen. John R. Dailey, the deputy commandant of the Marines, said
Monday that U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region are capable of
overcoming any Iraqi defense, although he stressed that President
Bush has given no order to conduct an offensive against Iraq.
   Dailey also said in an interview that the Marines have not been
told to expand the size of their 45,000-troop force in the gulf
area. He said adding troops remained a possibility, and that about
55,000 Marines in the United States have been readied for possible
deployment.
   The general said the prospect of Iraq raising an oil-fed wall of
fire around its defensive positions on Kuwait's southern border
with Saudi Arabia and along its eastern gulf shoreline added a new
twist to U.S. contingency plannin.
   ``With the dust and smoke mixed it's going to be hard to see
targets ahead, and that will impact on the tactical air (support)
and the artillery and the naval gunfire,'' he said. ``So all the
supporting arms are degraded to some extent.''
   Even so, Dailey said, the Marines are trained to handle unusual
obstacles.
   ``One of the ways we would get through these tank traps is to
fill them in ... with bulldozers that would come in and push sand
down the side, which would tend to put the fires out,'' he said.
   ``For all the things he's doing we have techniques to breach,''
Dailey said. ``A firewall we could drive through in any of the
equipment we have, unless it was so wide that it would burn all of
the oxygen and the engines wouldn't run.''
   The general said fires, even if they included oil-fed blazes
offshore from Kuwait City, would not stop a successful amphibious
landing. He said troops could be taken ashore in their amphibious
assault vehicles, which are routinely tested against fire damage.
Heavy equipment such as tanks would hit the beaches aboard landing
craft that move across water and ground on an air cushion.
   Helicopters could simply fly beyond the fire obstacles, and
airplanes such as the Marines' AV-8B Harrier jump jets could help
clear the way for ground forces, Dailey said.
   An amphibious assault force of about 11,000 Marines has been
afloat in the gulf since early in the crisis. It is practicing
amphibious landings in the northern Arabian Sea.
   The general said that while an amphibious assault on Kuwait's
coastline might not be the main thrust of a possible U.S. attack,
it could at least divert the Iraqi army's attention away from a
larger-scale offensive elsewhere.
   ``The thing he wouldn't know is where we'd come from if we
decided to move against him,'' he said.
   The Pentagon estimates that 430,000 Iraqi troops are in and
around Kuwait. The U.S. force in the area is nearly 240,000, and
more than 100,000 other foreign forces are there, too.

<HEAD>Mandatory Life for Drug Offenses Argued Before High Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fate of Ronald Harmelin, and possibly the
use of mandatory life prison terms in the war on drugs, hinges on a
Supreme Court ruling over what is cruel and unusual punishment.
   The justices heard arguments Monday in a case from Michigan over
the constitutionality of life behind bars without parole for
cocaine possession - and over the deterrent effect of such stiff
sentences.
   ``What are you going to do next, cut their arms off?'' said
Carla Johnson, an attorney for Harmelin, sentenced to a mandatory
life term in Michigan for possessing about 1{ pounds of cocaine.
   Ms. Johnson said the state law, the toughest of its kind in the
nation, has failed to deter drug dealing and most often snares the
low-level courier and not the narcotics kingpin.
   ``In this war on drugs, we have to fight it with constitutional
weapons,'' she said.
   Some justices sounded skeptical, repeatedly asking Ms. Johnson
to propose a broad principle defining what punishment is
permissible. The court is expected to announce its decision by
July.
   In other action Monday, the court:
   -Carved out a one-man exception to the military's ban on
homosexuals, letting stand a ruling the Army must re-enlist gay
soldier Perry Watkins of Tacoma, Wash. An appeals court did not
address the validity of the military's ban on homosexuals but
instead noted the Army repeatedly had re-enlisted Watkins while
knowing he is gay.
   -Refused to let some Puerto Rico cable TV systems be prosecuted
for carrying The Playboy Channel, rebuffing arguments that states'
anti-obscenity efforts may be hampered unduly.
   -Ruled unanimously in a Mississippi case that someone suing more
than one defendant generally does not have to include all of them
in the same lawsuit.
   In the arguments over the Harmelin case, Michigan prosecutor
Richard Thompson said the law is helping stem the drug flow because
``mules,'' narcotics distributors, are turning in their crime
bosses to avoid a life behind bars.
   Previously, Thompson said, short prison terms ``used to be
merely a cost of doing business. The focus is on the distribution
system.''
   Harmelin, now 45, was stopped by police for going through a red
light on May 12, 1986. There were 672 grams of pure cocaine in his
car's trunk. Police also found other items they said are tools of
the drug dealer's trade, including a pistol strapped to Harmelin's
ankle.
   A 1978 Michigan law imposes life in prison without parole for
anyone possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine, nearly 1{ pounds.
   Alabama is believed to be the only other state with mandatory
life for drug possession, but in that state the minimum amount of
drugs is about 15 times the Michigan amount.
   If the high court upholds the Michigan law, it could be a green
light for other states to adopt similar measures.
   Thompson urged the justices ``to send a clear signal'' that
tough penalties for drug dealers pass constitutional muster.
   The Supreme Court in 1983 overturned, by a 5-4 vote, a life
sentence without parole for a six-time repeat offender convicted of
bouncing a $100 check. The court said punishment must be
proportionate to the offense, the sentence imposed for other crimes
in the state and the practice of other states.
   Since then, two justices in the majority - Lewis F. Powell and
William J. Brennan - have retired and have been replaced by
Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.

   Do I have to give back the engagement ring now
that he's called off the wedding?
   Can I really eat all I want at a restaurant's ``All You Can
Eat'' night?
   A pizzeria advertises ``The Best Pizza in New Yok,'' but I
disagree. Can I get a refund?
   Maybe, maybe not, and no, according to a new legal guide by the
state Bar Association that explains New York law to non-lawyers
with nary a reference to res ipsa loquitur or collateral estoppel.
   ``Understanding the Law'' is the first book in a
question-and-answer format to focus on the law of a specific state,
according to Brad Carr, spokesman for the bar association.
   The $9.95 guide's questions are drawn from queries received by
the bar's telephone referral service. About a third of the callers
``don't really need legal assistance,'' Carr said. ``Why call a
lawyer if you don't have to?''
   Despite its promise of direct, simple answers, the guide leans
hard on qualifiers. Isn't an ``all you can eat'' restaurant's
refusal to serve more than two helpings of roast beef false
advertising? ``Probably not,'' the guide mumbles. ``The refusal ...
is probably reasonable under the circumstances. However, a
complaint to management would probably be in order.''
   But the guide does offer some solid advice - such as never share
the same divorce lawyer - and sets out the law in something like
black and white.
   You cannot work outside the home before the age of 14 unless you
are a model, performer or newspaper carrier. You cannot marry
before 18 without parental consent, or before 14 even with it. And
after getting a license you must wait 24 hours to tie the knot -
unless ``a party is in danger of imminent death or another
emergency of public interest exists.''
   A pregnant woman can't force the father to marry her. Blood
tests can be used only to rule out paternity, not to prove it.
Neither spouse is responsible for debts incurred by the other
before marriage. There is no right to sex in marriage, but denial
of it may be grounds for divorce.
   The so-called ``heart balm'' law that barred former fiances from
suing to recover engagement rings was repealed years ago. Now, a
judge can order you to hand back a ring if you got it ``solely on
the condition of marriage.''
   What if a contract contains ``fancy language that I can't
understand?'' Absent fraud or deception, you're bound by it if you
sign it. If you are sold tough meat at a premium price you may
demand your money back, but not if you ate it.
   If you default on your home improvement loan you can't stop your
car from being repossessed as collateral, even though it's the only
way you can get to work to make the money to pay off the loan. On
the bright side, you can't be jailed for defaulting on a loan.
   The guide does its best to dissuade the litigation-happy,
including the man who wants to know if he can sue a restaurant that
turned him away because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.
   The law will not grant a refund to the leisure traveler who
books a cruise and spends much of it bent over the rail, nor will
it protect the business traveler unable to work because the toddler
in the next seat wails from Boston to Los Angeles.
   You can sue your hairdresser for dying your hair even though
you'd asked for a highlight, but you can't sue your neighbor
because the lawn mower you bought at his garage sale needs major
repairs.
   The seller has no obligation to refund the purchase price of a
mail-order magician's kit just because an 11-year-old deemed it not
as ``neat'' as he expected.
   Finally, you can write your will by hand but you can't videotape
it, and the fee for a cemetery plot must be kept on deposit until
you use it.
   Much of the guide's legal wisdom is common sense. For instance,
one caller noticed ``a hair in my vegetable'' in an expensive
restaurant and wondered if she should have returned it.
   The guide says yes and adds, gratuiously, that ``a restaurant
impliedly warrants that the food it serves contains no foreign or
deleterious substance (and) is fit for human consumption.'' Even if
it's not the best pizza in New York.

<HEAD>Majority Support Attack if Iraq Mistreats Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost seven in 10 Americans responding to a
survey expect the United States to become involved in a war with
Iraq, and most respondents say America should attack if Iraq
mistreats U.S. hostages.
   The poll, conducted by ABC News and released Monday, also said
65 percent of those surveyed approve of President Bush's handling
of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. That figure is about the same as
a poll last month.
   Bush's approval rate overall was 59 percent, up from 51 percent
last week when the president's ratings dropped apparently because
of criticism of his approach to budget negotiations with Congress.
   About 61 percent disapproved of Bush's handling of the nation's
economy, the same number that disapproved of the way the Democrats
are dealing with economic matters. About 69 percent did not favor
the approach of Republicans in Congress to the issue.
   On the economy, 77 percent of Americans said the nation's
economy is getting worse, which represents no change from a month
earlier.
   But Bush's approval rating for a president heading into midterm
elections was second only to John F. Kennedy's 61 percent in
October 1962.
   The telephone poll was conducted Nov. 2-4 among a random
sampling of 1,093 voters. It has a error rate of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
   The survey suggested that Americans are hardening their views on
Iraq. For instance:
   -56 percent said the United States should attack Iraq if it
mistreats American hostages, and 41 percent favored such an attack
even if it costs hostages' lives.
   -51 percent favor an attack if the international economic
embargo does not succeed in driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   -Nearly seven in 10 expect the United States will become
involved in a war with Iraq.
   -Two-thirds approve of the United States stationing troops in
Saudi Arabia, while 31 percent believe American forces should have
stayed out of the gulf.
   -A majority - seven in 10 - want Bush to gain permission from
Congress before going to war with Iraq.
   The poll also indicated that the anti-incumbent fever may be
moderating among voters.
   Some 50 percent said they are inclined to look around for
someone other than the incumbent, but that number is down from 57
percent last month.
   And while 54 percent said they still disapprove of Congress,
about 72 percent said they approve of their own representative.

<HEAD>UPI Says It Faces Liquidation Unless Employees Take Big Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International says it will be
forced into liquidation in less than two weeks unless union
employees of the news service accept a 90-day pay cut of 35
percent.
   A spokesman for the Wire Service Guild, which represents the
employees, said Monday the union is recommending rejection of the
proposal.
   Pieter Vanbennekom, UPI executive vice president, told
employees, ``A `no' vote to the company's request will simply mean
that after Nov. 16 ... we cannot ensure that we will have enough
cash on hand to meet the payroll and other life-or-death
obligations for the next two weeks.
   ``Therefore, we will have to take the once unthinkable step of
putting UPI into liquidation,'' Vanbennekom said.
   ``At this point we see no real alternative if the vote is
against the proposal,'' UPI vice president and spokesman Milt Capps
said. He declined to say how the liquidation would be carried out.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the guild, said from the
union's headquarters in New York, ``There is little doubt in our
minds that the company needs a lot of money and it needs a lot of
money fast. We are simply saying that they are coming to the wrong
people to get that kind of money.
   ``These employees can't afford a 35 percent wage cut,'' Dahl
said. He said UPI has ``come to us for concessions probably seven
times in the last decade and there is no more left to give.''
   Still, he said the proposal would be submitted to the members
because ``this is a very, very serious situation that every member
should have the opportunity to have their own say on.''
   Capps declined to say how many employees are involved, saying it
is against company policy. An industry source, speaking on the
condition he not be identified, estimated there are 500 to 600
employees covered by the Guild contract, of whom about 300 belong
to the union.
   UPI announced Friday that it had cut management salaries by 35
percent for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from
employees represented by the guild in an effort to improve the
company's financial condition as it seeks a buyer.
   UPI has changed ownership three times in the past eight years.
The news service announced in September that it would close bureaus
in five states and said Oct. 12 it was dismissing an unspecified
number of employees.
   Vanbennekom, in a message to employees transmitted over the
company's wires, said, ``UPI in its last few decades never had a
real chance at taking its rightful place among the successful
giants of the growing information industry. It is up to us now to
make sure we get a real chance.''
   He cautioned, however, that approval of the pay cut would not
``guarantee UPI will be successfully sold.''
   ``The only thing it guarantees is that we will be able to take
the process to its conclusion, giving us vital breathing room to
find the best possible home for UPI,'' he said.
   Vanbennekom said last Friday that at least six possible buyers
had expressed interest in the 83-year-old news service, which is
owned by Infotechnology Inc.
   He told employees that if the proposal is rejected ``it is
virtually certain that there will be no assets left to satisfy
obligations such as severance pay.''

   Democrats hold out hope that today's election
will boost their Senate majority to the largest margin since the
final years of the Carter administration.
   The outcome of a tossup contest in North Carolina and close
races in Oregon and Minnesota will determine whether those hopes
are realized or remain stars in Democratic eyes.
   Political historian Allan Lichtman of American University
believes the latter is likely.
   ``Forget all the nonsense about turn the rascals out. Ninety
percent of the incumbents are holding firm,'' Lichtman said Monday,
forecasting little change in the 55-45 Democratic advantage in the
Senate.
   It may be the only change will come in Hawaii, where Republican
Rep. Pat Saiki has a strong shot at unseating recently appointed
Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka. And that could narrow the Democrats'
margin.
   Nevertheless, Democrats are counting on a few surprises in
several states.
   Their prime target in 1990 has been North Carolina's Republican
Sen. Jesse Helms, who faces a strong test from challenger Harvey
Gantt.
   Polls differed on who was the leader going into today's
election.
   On the final day of campaigning Monday, Helms charged that
Gantt, who is black, supports racial quotas in job hiring. But
Helms denied he had made race an issue in the volatile contest.
   Gantt said he would accept Helms' liberal label if the
definition of the word is a person who cares.
   Also on the eve of the election, the Justice Department
announced it was sending a team of lawyers to North Carolina to try
to ensure that minority voters aren't disqualified from voting
based on information gathered by the state Republican Party.
   Democrats have accused the state GOP of sending out postcards to
intimidate black voters who otherwise might vote for Gantt and of
gathering information with which to challenge the eligibility of
minority voters.
   Elsewhere, Republican Sens. Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Rudy
Boschwitz of Minnesota received political scares last month as
polls showed their opponents within striking distance.
   Both incumbents appear to have stemmed the tide of voter
disenchantment, although polls have businessman-scientist Harry
Lonsdale not far behind Hatfield. And college professor Paul
Wellstone was close on the heels of Boschwitz.
   In the latest political volley, the Boschwitz camp sent a letter
to the Minnesota Jewish community noting that while both candidates
are Jewish, Wellstone married a non-Jew and his children are not
being raised in the religion.
   Wellstone called the letter ``unforgivable ... the most personal
attack of all.''
   Not since the last years of the Carter administration - 1979-80
- have the Democrats enjoyed such a lopsided majority in the
Senate. Then, the Democrats held a 59-41 margin.
   They lost control of the Senate in the 1980 Reagan landslide and
didn't reclaim it until 1986.
   A victory for Gantt could change the tenor of the Senate, where
lawmakers have fought long and hard with Helms, the
arch-conservative who has sought to end federal assistance for arts
deemed pornographic and to reduce spending to combat AIDS.
   Helms, dubbed ``Senator No,'' battled both the Democrats and the
GOP administration over the 1988 U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe. Helms was one of
five votes against the pact.
   The Senate is likely to take up the expected U.S.-Soviet
agreement to limit conventional forces in Europe when it returns
next year. Helms is certain to lead the fight against that pact if
he's still in the Senate.
   If elected, Gantt would be only the fourth black to serve in the
Senate and the first since Republican Edward W. Brooke represented
Massachusetts from 1967 to 1979.
   The other two blacks were Mississippi Republicans Hiram R.
Revels, 1870-1871, and Blanche K. Bruce, 1875-1881.
   If Saiki wins, it would be the first time three women have
served in the Senate since 1954, when Republican Margaret Chase
Smith represented Maine and Nebraska Republicans Hazel H. Abel and
Eva K. Bowring were appointed.
   It also would mark the first time the Senate included three
elected female members. The others are Sens. Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.

   Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan says his Nation
of Islam will take a more active role in politics.
   For the first time in the religious group's history, the Nation
of Islam has three political candidates running for office. But
Farrakhan said it would not be the last time.
   The three include George X. Cure, 34, running for the District
of Columbia's non-voting seat in Congress and Shawn X. Brackeen,
33, running for a seat on the city's school board.
   ``For 60 years, the Honorable Elijah Muhammed has been preparing
the Nation of Islam to serve black people and the larger
community,'' Farrakhan said. ``We believe now is the time that we
should offer what we have learned ... to the community, government
and the nation.''
   Farrakhan said he has no political aspirations for himself,
adding that religious leaders would better serve the community by
acting as watchdog.

<HEAD>Justice Department Files Suit Over Facsimile Absentee Ballots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department filed suit to force
Tennessee to accept absentee ballot applications sent by facsimile
transmission from three servicemen stationed in the Middle East.
   The lawsuit charged that Tennessee, the only state the Justice
Department said was not allowing U.S. soldiers in the Middle East
to vote by fax, was violating the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
Absentee Voting Act.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Nashville, stated
that Shelby County Election Commission on the advice of the state,
refused to accept absentee ballot applications from three GIs.
   The refusal was based on a state legal opinion that the absentee
applications were not ``mail'' as defined by the Tennessee election
statute. But the complaint contends that the election law allows
applications by mail to be ``in any form.''
   Assistant Attorney General John R. Dunne said in a statement
that Tennessee ``is the only state to refuse applications for
absentee ballots actually sent by fax from military personnel.''
   The complaint seeks a court order directing the state to accept
the three applications, send the GIs absentee ballots as quickly as
possible and count the ballots if they are cast in accordance with
the law.

   When it comes to selling a brothel, the
Internal Revenue Service has a few hang-ups.
   Condoms and paintings of bare-breasted women are OK at next
week's tax sale of the Mustang Ranch. Dirty movies are out.
   Among the gaudier items to be sold when the auction of the
100-room bordello and its contents begins Nov. 13 are teddy bears,
pajamas, sequined and feathered gowns and pocket-sized ceramic
liquor bottles decorated with naked women.
   What's not for sale at America's best known legal brothel is a
small collection of porno flicks that were found in the purple,
mirror-walled Orgy Room when the IRS seized the property Sept. 21
for $13 million in back taxes owed by Joe and Sally Conforte.
   ``The IRS can't sell anything illegal,'' said Richard Flakus,
IRS chief collection agent in Nevada.
   The defunct house of ill repute has sparked interest for use as
a nursing home, a halfway house and a girls' reform school, said
Dierdre Pagni, an IRS manager.
   ``A religious group expressed an interest as well,'' she said,
declining to give details.
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee had hoped to operate the
bordello and pay off its debts but came up against licensing and
cash flow problems, and the IRS padlocked the place before it could
reopen. It had operated at a legal bawdy house since 1971. Last
month, county commissioners revoked its permit.
   The 50 or so ladies of the night who worked there since the IRS
moved in have gone on to other ventures.
   The IRS hopes to earn at least $1.8 million when the property
falls under the auctioneer's gavel.
   ``We highly encourage the neighborhood yard sale enthusiast to
come out and make a bid on anything they may want,'' Ms. Pagni
said, as she led reporters on a tour Monday.
   The tour did not include a glimpse of Conforte's Rolodex, which
Ms. Pagni quickly snatched from a reporter's glance. The modern
version of the former owner's little black book is not for sale.
   The beds won't be sold individually. They are attached to the
floor and linked to other parts of the place via buzzers.
   But for those who want a little of Mustang's colorful history,
there are signs posting service charges, Mustang Ranch matchbooks
and complimentary coupons.
   There are practical items. Like 22 fire extinguishers and nine
bottles of emergency oxygen that were kept on the premises.
   Also in the catalog is a music box from the suite used by the
bordello manager. It plays ``Somewhere My Love.'' The jukebox in
the lobby will be sold as is, with tunes such as ``Make You Sweat''
and ``Whip Appeal.''
   Copies of personalized license plates on sale would make
Conforte cringe. The plates read ``Pimp,'' a word Conforte
despises. Nevada is the only state with legalized prostitution, and
that makes Conforte a legitimate businessman.
   Whoever purchases the building may want to redecorate. The
hodgepodge decor emphasizes black, purple, pink, red and orange.

<DATELINE>RUWEISHID, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A constant stream of oil tanker trucks
flows in both directions over the Jordanian-Iraqi borders, but
police turn away Jordanian trucks stacked with food supplies for
Iraq.
   The Jordan-bound tankers, full of crude petroleum, rumbled in at
a rate of two a minute during an overnight observation Sunday night
and Monday morning.
   But that was the only activity in Ruweishid, a bleak desert
outpost 210 miles northeast of Amman.
   Camps that housed tens of thousands of Arab and Asian refugees
fleeing Iraq and Kuwait are now empty, except for the Jordanian
army and desert police who patrol the frontier.
   Some refugees from Kuwait have said they saw Jordanian trucks
loaded with vegetables in the captive emirate. But any lapse in
enforcing sanctions on the only highway linking Iraq and Jordan
appears to have been a thing of the past.
   ``Open the trunk!'' an army officer bellowed at a driver at a
border checkpoint. He confiscated a bag of cookies.
   ``You are not allowed to take this or any food to the Iraqi
borders!'' he shouted - unaware he was talking to a reporter.
   The border has increased in importance as a key link in the
U.N.-mandated embargo on trade with Baghdad that seeks to force
Saddam Hussein to relinquish Kuwait.
   Iraq's economy is particularly vulnerable because it depends on
exporting oil and importing food. Iraq had imported at least 70
percent of its food, much of it from the United States, Canada and
Australia, and was anticipating oil revenue of $14 billion to $15
billion this year.
   Jordan dragged its feet in implementing the sanctions. Amman
depends heavily on trade with Iraq, and Saddam Hussein enjoys
popular support in Jordan.
   King Hussein found it hard to comply immediately.
   But with the incentive of economic aid from the Persian Gulf oil
states to help an economy reeling from refugees and trade losses,
Jordan sealed the border shut for food and other supplies.
   Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine said in an interview
thagt Jordan does not stop the oil tankers because ``we do not have
any other oil resource at this moment.
   ``We have informed the U.N. Sanctions Committee that we did not
stop importing Iraqi oil because we need Iraq's oil now that Saudi
Arabia cut off its oil supplies to Jordan,'' he said.
   The Saudi-owned Tapline Corp. stopped supplying oil to Jordan in
September, claiming Jordan had an outstanding debt of $46 million.
Many observers interpreted the move as punishment for supporting
Iraq.
   Finance Minister Basil Jerdaneh denies Jordan is failing to
honor the embargo: ``We will not allow any violations of the
mandatory sanctions or tolerate anything like that.''
   He says Jordan has issued strict orders to police to stop all
relief convoys from crossing into Iraq, adding that the army ``has
so far succeeded in stopping all convoys, including supplies on
humanitarian grounds.''
   Truck convoys set up by Jordanian charity groups carried food
and medicine to Iraq in September.
   ``I have instructions to allow only oil tankers across after I
check their cargo,'' a young Jordanian soldier told a reporter who
cruised miles of back roads during the night.
   Dozens of Jordanian army patrols were seen in Ruweishid and
nearby desert towns along the border. All vehicles were forced to
stop at nine separate police checkpoints.
   At about dawn Monday, a line of 14 trucks was parked at the
entrance to Ruweishid . Police threatened to arrest truck drivers
if they did not turn back to Amman.
   ``We are carrying food supplies for the Iraqi people,'' said one
driver, who identified himself as Mohammad Taji. ``I know we are
not allowed to do so, but we do not want to see a neighbor
starving.''
   Oil coming into Jordan is a different matter.
   Before the crisis that began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, Jordan relied on Iraq and Kuwait for about 90 percent of
its annual imports of approximately 22 million barrels of oil and
oil derivatives.
   It bought the rest from Saudi Arabia.
   The oil-rich kingdom offered in mid-August to provide Jordan
with 35,000 barrels of oil daily, to help wean it from depending on
Iraqi oil.
   ``We are importing oil from Iraq under a special arrangement
under which Iraq is repaying a $310 million debt'' to Jordan
incurred during the Iran-Iraq war, said Izzeddine.
   Jerdaneh has said that under the agreement, the price of oil
will not exceed $16.40 a barrel, well below current world market
rates.

<TEXT>
   A technical error in bill-drafting is
accomplishing what pitched battles on the floor of Congress
sometimes fail to produce: a cut in U.S. foreign affairs spending,
to the tune of $395 million.
   Lawmakers plan to restore the lost money when the 102nd Congress
convenes in January. In the meantime, the cut is small enough - 1.9
percent of a $20 billion foreign operations budget - that
bureaucrats will be able to minimize the effects by juggling other
funds, officials said.
   But the slip-up is an embarrassing one, coming on the heels of a
year-long budget war between President Bush and congressional
Democrats that polls say added to the public's lack of faith in
government officials.
   Administration and congressional aides, who discussed the
blunder on condition of anonymity, agreed that the mistake was made
late last month during Congress' dash to finish its business and
adjourn for the year.
   ``It's too bad we couldn't change it,'' said one congressional
official. ``But everyone was gone by the time we figured it out.''
   But once committed, the error forces across-the-board cuts under
new budget procedures Congress also enacted in the hours before its
departure.
   All foreign operations spending will be reduced by 1.9 percent
until the money is restored - including foreign aid, operations of
the State Department and its embassies, and U.S. contributions to
the United Nations and other international organizations.
   ``At this point, the State Department and other international
agencies and OMB are working to see there is as minimal an impact
resulting from this as possible,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Nancy Beck.
   OMB is the Office of Management and Budget, the White House
agency that oversees federal spending.
   An administration official said the slashes probably would be
triggered on Friday.
   One of the last measures lawmakers approved on Oct. 27 - hours
before adjournment - was the annual foreign aid bill.
   The measure provided $15.5 billion for the budget year that
began Oct. 1. Separate legislation provided another $4.6 billion
for the operations of the State Department and its embassies and
for U.S. contributions to international organizations, bringing
total foreign affairs spending to $20.1 billion.
   Included in the $15.5 billion foreign aid legislation was $4.6
billion for military assistance. The bill also granted $403 million
in military loans.
   But instead of including the $403 million within the $4.6
billion in total military assistance - which should have occurred -
the bill was written to make the $403 million additional spending.
   The error - referred to by one aide as ``our little glitch'' -
caused a problem with the new budget procedures.
   Under those rules, spending on international programs may not
exceed $20.1 billion this year. If it does, all foreign affairs
spending is cut across-the-board by enough to compensate for the
over spending.
   Because of the drafting error, that $20.1 billion cap was
exceeded by $395 million. That will result in a 1.9 percent cut in
all foreign affairs programs until Congress restores the money.
   The new budget law states that the across-the-board cuts must
take effect within 15 days after Congress adjourns.
   ``The laws are very strict,'' the official said.
   The new Congress will be sworn in on January 3. It then plans to
recess and return for legislative business on about Jan. 21.

<HEAD>New Spaceship Would Cut Cost of Space Travel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study says a spacecraft that can
climb into orbit by firing a single group of reusable rockets could
cut the cost of flying in space dramatically.
   The study advocates an ``aircraft-type operation'' capable of
putting a ship into orbit every two days.
   The Pentagon's Star Wars organization has four aerospace firms
under contract to design a single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft,
choosing from among ships that take off and land vertically, those
that take off and land like a conventional airplane, and those that
are launched vertically and land on a runway like the space
shuttle.
   The organization High Frontier studied a concept in which a
cone-shaped vehicle, named SSX for Spaceship Experimental, would
launch and land vertically using eight thrusters.
   Operating a fleet of four such vehicles, the study says, would
bring down the cost of putting a satellite into low Earth orbit
from $10,803 a pound to $440. The study estimated that building a
prototype of the SSX would be $1.6 billion.
   At present the United States is concentrating on developing new
space technologies for the National Aero-Space plane - the
so-called Orient Express envisioned by former President Reagan -
and has budgeted $258 million for the project this year.
   Daniel O. Graham, a retired lieutenant general who heads High
Frontier, said the SSX would draw on the lightweight materials and
other advanced technologies developed for the plane. High Frontier
is an organization made up of retired military officers, scientists
and engineers that strongly backs the Strategic Defense Initiative,
popularly called Star Wars.
   Graham said it takes 12,447 people for space shuttle operations
- a major part of the expense - but that the SSX would reduce that
number by 96 percent.

   Rabbi Meir Kahane, who campaigned to drive Arabs
from Israel and urged American Jews to arm themselves against
anti-Semitism, was shot to death Monday night after a speech at a
Manhattan hotel.
   Police identified the assailant as El Sayyid A. Nosair, 35,
whose nationality was unknown. He was wounded by a postal police
officer as they exchanged gunfire outside the Halloran House, said
Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli.
   The postal officer and a bystander in the hotel were also
wounded, police said.
   Kahane, 58, a Brooklyn-born Israeli extremist who once served in
the Israeli parliament, was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital,
said hospital spokesman Peter Schectman.
   Mayor David Dinkins said the shooting was ``an international
tragedy that shocks all of us.''
   Kahane was head of the anti-Arab Kach party in Israel. The party
advocates the ouster of all Arabs from Israeli-held territory and a
ban on Jewish-Arab marriages. The movement's symbol is a clenched
fist inside a Star of David.
   Kahane founded the militant Jewish Defense League in the United
States in 1968 to mount armed responses to anti-Semitic acts. The
group organized classes in karate and weapons training and held
patrols in high-crime neighborhoods.
   Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American-Jewish Organizations, called Kahane ``a highly
controversial figure who had strong supporters and opponents.''
   ``Whatever one thought about his political program, his shocking
assassination will be deplored by friends and foes alike,'' he
said.
   Witnesses said Kahane had given a speech to about 60 people at a
meeting of the Zionist Emergency Evacuation Rescue Organization.
Shortly after 9 p.m., as Kahane answered questions from the podium,
a gunman who sat through the speech stood up and fired twice at him
from a distance of about 4 feet, Borrelli said. Kahane was hit once
in the neck.
   The assailant ran from the room, bumping into a 73-year-old man,
whom he shot in the leg, Borrelli said.
   The gunman fled outside and tried to hijack a taxi, he said. An
on-duty postal officer outside a nearby post office intervened.
They exchanged gunshots and both were wounded.
   The officer was shot in the arm and the gunman was hit in the
chin.
   All were taken to Bellevue where the gunman was taken to
surgery, said hospital spokeswoman Karen Crowe. He was expected to
survive. The officer's wound was superficial, she said. All were
listed in stable condition.
   The gunman's nationality was unknown, and he apparently lived in
New Jersey, Borrelli said.
   The hotel on Lexington Avenue is also called the New York
Marriott East Side.
   Kahane served as a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament,
for four years but was barred from running for re-election in 1988
after legislators passed a law banning parties that have a racist
platform.
   In September, Kahane went on trial in Jerusalem on charges of
disturbing public order for leading an anti-Arab rally after the
stabbing deaths of two Israelis last year. Kahane was also charged
with sedition for calling Arabs ``cancer spreading in our midsts''
during a separate incident. Another hearing in the trial was
scheduled for December.
   The sedition charge stems from a Kahane rally in Jerusalem on
July 7, 1989, a day after a Palestinian from the occupied Gaza
Strip grabbed the wheel of an Israeli bus, plunging it into a steep
ravine on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Sixteen people were
killed in the attack.
   ``Kill those who come to kill you,'' Kahane told the crowd. His
supporters chanted ``Death to the Arabs!'' and waved signs
demanding that all Arabs be expelled from Israel and the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Kahane moved to Israel in 1971 and became a citizen a year
later. He renounced his American citizenship to run for Israel's
parliament.
   Kahane conceded in a 1971 interview that the Jewish Defense
League's tactics were inspired by black militant groups.
   ``Our point of view is that no anti-Semitism was ever created by
a Jew who fought back,'' Kahane said.
   He was born Martin David Kahane on Aug. 1, 1932, in the New York
City borough of Brooklyn. He began using the name Meir after his
ordination as a rabbi in 1957.
   Martin Cohen, an attorney and follower of Kahane who was at
Monday's meeting, called Kahane a martyr.
   ``He stood for every Jew who no longer wants to be kicked
around, for every Jew who remembers the Holocaust,'' Cohen said.
``Many people believed he was an extremist, but he was a kind,
gentle man who died for what he believed.''
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, said he disagreed strongly with Kahane's
political philosophy.
   ``I nevertheless deeply regret his violent end,'' Schindler
said. ``He did not deserve to die by an assassin's bullet.''

<HEAD>Doctors Urged To Work To Promote Health, Disease Prevention In
Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life may or may not begin at 40, but a new
federal study says getting on in years does not mean a person has
to get old in the sense of getting sick and frail.
   A committee of the Institute of Medicine said in a report
released Monday the fact is that research, health promotion and
education can head off much of the illness and disability
associated with aging.
   ``Our misplaced pessimism gives rise to the particularly
troubling consequence that many more individuals who could
experience a fulfilling maturity are denied the chance by these
stereotypes,'' the committee report said.
   ``We should not let pessimism become an obstacle to the
introduction of new research on interventions to restore and
maintain function among physically or mentally impaired older
people.''
   Since American society is gradually aging, the report said, the
medical community should promote healthy lifestyles not only for
the young, but for all ages.
   The committee made recommendations in 13 areas:
   -High Blood Pressure: Since high blood pressure often precedes
stroke and heart attack, the committee said there should be
programs of education, detection and treatment among those over age
50. It said Medicare and private insurance should reimburse the
expense of doctor visits to evaluate blood pressure, and that more
research is needed on treating hypertension in the elderly.
   -Medications: Age should be taken into account in testing drugs.
Health care workers and elderly patients should be more aware of
the combined effects possible from combinations of medications.
   -Infectious Diseases: All people over 50 should be immunized
against pneumonia and influenza. Better infection controls should
be used in hospitals and nursing homes.
   -Osteoporosis: Older people should be instructed about measures
to prevent thinning of the bones, such as adequate calcium and
vitamin D intake, and the need to maintain physical activity. More
research is needed about how to best treat fractures caused by
osteoporosis.
   -Sensory Loss: Better services should be provided to those
losing sight and hearing, and public and private insurers should
cover more of these costs.
   -Oral Health: More research is needed to achieve and maintain
dental health among the elderly. Dental loss now is largely
preventable in the elderly.
   -Cancer Screening: More aggressive cancer checkups should be
instituted among the elderly.
   -Nutrition: Further research is needed on the minimum nutrition
requirements of the elderly.
   -Smoking: Even the elderly should be encouraged to stop.
Advertising of tobacco products should be banned.
   -Depression: Doctors should be trained to recognize and treat
depression among the elderly, and some limitations on Medicare and
insurance reimbursements for psychiatric care should be removed.
   -Physical Inactivity: Sedentary lifestyles can damage health.
Health care workers should promote programs to encourage elderly to
get regular exercise.
   -Social Isolation: Isolated individuals should be identified and
means found to give them more social contact. Loneliness, the
report said, can play an important role in development of disease
and disability.
   -Falls: ``Falls among the elderly are a major cause of
mortality, morbidity and disability,'' the report said. It
recommends more research on methods of preventing falls, and
studies on how best to treat injuries that result from falls.
   The Institute of Medicine is associated with the National
Academy of Sciences, which is a private organization chartered by
Congress to be an advisor to the federal government.

<HEAD>Kahane Aroused Passions with Anti-Arab Rhetoric</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rabbi Meir Kahane was hated by the Israeli
establishment but could gather thousands of fanatical young Jews to
march through the streets of Jerusalem shouting ``Death to the
Arabs.''
   Kahane, who was shot to death in his native New York on Monday
night, founded the militant Jewish Defense League in the United
States.
   In Israel, he created the Kach movement, which demanded the
ouster of all Arabs from Israeli-held territory.
   The 58-year-old rabbi, with a salt-and-pepper beard and piercing
eyes, could give coldly logical explanations for his views at news
conferences and speeches arousing hatred on the streets.
   ``Revenge is a very Jewish concept,'' he used to say when asked
about his call to expel the 1.7 million Palestinians from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as the 800,000 Arab
citizens from Israel.
   When he was elected to the Israeli Parliament in 1984, Kahane
promised a bill that would bring about such an ouster.
   ``There will be a detailed bill calling for the transfer of the
Arabs from the land of Israel,'' he said in an interview.
   ``We expect a majority of them to leave on their own since the
promise is that those who are ready to leave quietly will receive
compensation, and those who won't, we'll throw out,'' he explained.
   Kahane, however, was blocked from enforcing his ideas by both
the Israeli left and right. His term in the Knesset, or parliament,
was fiery but without results.
   At his death, he faced charges of sedition in Israel for saying
at a rally that Arabs were ``a cancer spreading in our midst.'' He
had been barred in 1988 from running again for the Knesset under a
court ruling that deemed his faction racist.
   Kahane, however, maintained that he was only blocked from
running because the popularity of his movement was growing amid the
violence of the Palestinian revolt against Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza.
   He maintained that Kach would get six or seven seats in the
120-member Parliament, taking away votes from the right-wing Likud
bloc that heads the Israeli government.
   ``I have touched a simple and honest nerve on the part of the
people,'' he said in a newspaper interview. ``Everything in Israel
has a time, and this is an idea whose time has come.''
   Kahane, born in Brooklyn, first attracted notoriety in the
tensions that arose as traditional New York Jewish neighborhoods
began to give way to blacks in the 1960s.
   He founded the Jewish Defense League in 1968, calling on young
Jews to arm themselves against anti-Semitism.
   It began as a patrol group to protect elderly Jews from muggers
in New York neighborhoods, but was eventually described as a Jewish
terrorist organization blamed for fatal bombings and other attacks
on Arabs and Soviets.
   In 1971, Kahane moved to Israel and urged other American Jews to
follow as a way to build the country into a purely Jewish state.
   He founded Kach - Hebrew for ``thus''' - and began preaching his
philosophy of casting the Arabs out by walking through the steets
waving a Bible and shouting through a megaphone.
   He was mocked by most Israelis and ignored by the news media. He
ran unsuccessfully for the Knesset three times.
   But the turn to the right that Israeli politics took in the late
1970s was to Kahane's advantage. After his election in 1984,
Israelis were talking about the new phenomenon of ``Kahanism,'' an
extremist philosophy based on the rabbi's frequent characterization
of Arabs as ``disgusting dogs.''
   Ora Namir, a member of the center-left Labor Party, said in
1985: ``Kahane is articulating what other right-wingers so far dare
not say out loud. The difference is a matter of style, not
content.''
   Gabi Sheffer, a Hebrew University political scientist, said the
Kach movement preyed on Israelis' fear and uncertainty over what to
do about the Arabs in their midst.
   ``Even if Kahane himself can be regarded as a temporary
aberration, the development of Kahanism will continue to haunt
Israel,'' he wrote in The Jerusalem Post.
   Israel's right-wing leaders vociferously denied they shared
Kahane's ideas. ``My friends and I have nothing in common with the
man,'' said former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, whose Likud bloc
ended 29 years of Labor Party rule in 1977.
   After a law was passed to bar political parties that were racist
- and Kach was barred under the law - Kahane remained a force on
the streets.
   When attacks were made on Jews, Kahane and his supporters would
appear moments later to chant ``Death to the Arabs.''
   The marchers would wear yellow T-shirts to recall the yellow arm
bands Jews were forced to wear by the Nazis. But the shirts had on
them the Kach symbol - a Jewish star with a clenched fist.
   ``I want the Arabs out, I want them all out. I wish them well. I
wish they can live happily with their brothers in Beirut,'' Kahane
said after he was blocked by police from leading a march into
Jerusalem's Old City in July 1989.
   The march came after an Arab grabbed the steering wheel of a bus
on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway, plunging it into a ravine and
killing 16 Jewish passengers.
   His words at the rally brought the charge of sedition, still
unsettled in court at his death.

   The dollar slid against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
on Tuesday, and share prices also were lower.
   The dollar closed at 127.20 yen, down 0.15 yen from Monday's
close of 127.35 yen. It opened at 126.40 yen and ranged between
126.35 yen and 127.30 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average for 225 selected issues shed 419.58
points, or 1.72 percent, to 23,965.75. The benchmark index gained
190.34 points Monday.
   The price of the No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds was
quoted at 84.79 points, down from late Monday's 85.05. Their yield
was 7.750 percent, up from 7.690.
   The dollar, after opening lower in response to its decline on
overseas markets, inched up on buy orders from investors trying to
cover short positions, dealers said.
   Also lending the dollar support in Tokyo was a British newspaper
report that the United States and Britain had decided to attack
Iraq by this weekend, said Koichiro Amaya, a dealer with Chemical
Bank.
   Amaya said the Daily Star's report, quoted by Japan's Jiji Press
earlier Tuesday, prompted some investors to buy the dollar. ``But
the investors were only half-serious about the report. ... It was
just convenient for them to use it as a reason to adjust their
short dollar positions,'' he added.
   Because of general pessimism about the U.S. economy, traders are
expected to shun the dollar for the time being unless there are new
developments to support the U.S. unit, Amaya said.
   On the stock market, traders said the Nikkei index gained some
250 points at the opening but slid for the rest of the session.
   They said corporate investors were selling futures following
Monday's advance.

   Luther Campbell of the rap group 2 Live Crew
says people should spend more time worrying about homelessness and
hunger and less time trying to prove the lyrics to his songs are
obscene.
   ``We have an outrageous amount of people sleeping in the streets
and without anything to eat, but we find rappers more important,''
Campbell wrote in a essay in Monday's Los Angeles Times.
   Campbell and fellow 2 Live Crew members Mark ``Brother Marquis''
Ross and Chris ``Fresh Kid Ice'' Wongwon were acquitted in Florida
last month of obscenity for performing songs from their ``As Nasty
as They Wanna Be'' album.
   They could have been jailed for up to a year.
   ``Our environment is slowly being pulled apart, and we put
people in jail for a bunch of words,'' Campbell wrote. ``Sometimes
I wonder what starving people in Ethiopia would think about the
money we've wasted on taking this to court.''
   Campbell also said the lyrics from ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be''
reflect his black culture and are ``nothing but a group of fellas
bragging.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Tina Turner has decided she isn't ready for
the rock 'n' rollers' retirement home yet.
   Miss Turner, who once spoke of quitting the concert circuit
after her just-completed ``Foreign Affair'' tour, now says she'll
be back after a year's vacation. She turns 52 on Nov. 26.
   ``I'm the first woman to fill all these stadiums and the feeling
from all those fans night after night was fantastic. I don't want
to close that door completely,'' Miss Turner said through a
publicist after concluding her tour Sunday in the Netherlands.
   Miss Turner became famous in the mid-1960s in a duo with her
then-husband, Ike Turner. Her hits, with or without Turner, include
``Proud Mary'' and ``What's Love Got to Do With It?''

   CHICAGO (AP) - Oprah Winfrey has put back on quite a few of the
67 pounds she shed during a crash diet two years ago, but she has
no plans to starve herself thin again.
   ``I'll never diet again,'' the talk show host told her audience
Monday. ``I certainly will never fast again.''
   Ms. Winfrey announced in 1989 that she had regained 17 of the 67
pounds she had lost the year before on a diet that consisted of
weeks of drinking a high-protein powder mixed with water.
   She didn't disclose her weight Monday.

   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Art has imitated life for Emmy-winning
actress Marg Helgenberger, whose ``China Beach'' character K.C.
once worked in a meatpacking plant just like Miss Helgenberger did.
   Miss Helgenberger said the TV show's writers made K.C., who is a
prostitute, a former meatpacker after the actress mentioned in
passing that she worked for two years at a Nebraska packing plant
while trying to break into theater.
   In one episode, K.C. explained how she learned to numb herself
to the harshness of life after watching the slaughtering of a cow.
   ``It's hard work. It really is hard work,'' said Miss
Helgenberger, 31, who was in Omaha recently to visit her mother.
``Any of those assembly line jobs are tough, you know, and you have
to respect people for doing it.''

   A Hubble Space Telescope instrument has
focused on a quasar billions of light years away in the first
spectral observations of a faint object by the $1.5 billion
orbiting telescope, says NASA.
   The instrument, a faint object spectrograph, targeted the quasar
known as UM675 in a study of the chemical composition of the early
universe.
   A NASA announcement said Monday that the quasar appears to be
receding from the Earth at a speed of about 80 percent of the speed
of light.
   To make the readings, the space telescope focused on UM675 for
33 minutes in each of three different orbits. A computer at the
Goddard Spce Center then combined the data to create a single data
set.
   Hubble has a focusing problem that seriously affects
instruments, such as cameras, that work only in the visible portion
of the spectrum. The focusing flaw, however, has less effect in the
invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

   More than three in four Americans believe the
nation's economy is worsening and most are unhappy about President
Bush and Congress are dealing with it, according to an ABC News
poll.
   By a margin of 61 percent to 36 percent, respondents said in the
poll released Monday said they disapproved of Bush's handling of
the economy.
   An almost identical 61 percent to 33 percent disapproved of
congressional Democrats' handling of the economy.
   The disapproval rate was somewhat higher for congressional
Republicans - 69 percent to 26 percent.
   Seventy-seven percent of those questioned said the economy was
getting worse, while only 4 percent said it was improving.
   The figures came from a survey of 1,015 people questioned
between Oct. 23 and 25. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
   The survey found Bush's approval rating has rebounded from its
low of 51 percent a week ago to 59 percent.
   Public opinion of Congress continues to drop, but those
questioned still generally like their own representatives.

<HEAD>Proposal Would Require Drug Makers To Report Effects On Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers would have to tell physicians
how prescription drugs affect elderly patients under a new
government proposal.
   The information, some of which is already provided voluntarily
by many companies already, would have to be included in drug
labeling sent to physicians and pharmacists, said the Food and Drug
Administration. This labeling, required by the FDA, is usually
available to patients upon request.
   ``As our knowledge has grown of how drugs work within the body,
we've recognized the special concerns associated with drug use in
the elderly,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
said Monday in a statement.
   ``Physicians need to be provided with any patient information
that's available about the drugs they prescribe for senior
patients,'' he said.
   One of the differences between an old patient and a young one is
the ability of their kidneys - people lose a third or more of their
kidney function between the ages of 30 and 90, Sullivan said.
   With less kidney function, drugs do not clear the body as fast.
This might mean that a muscle relaxant that works fine for a young
person might relax older people too much, causing them to fall and
break a hip, he said.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said the proposal is
important because those over 65 account for more than 30 percent of
people taking prescription drugs while comprising 12 percent of the
population.
   ``One of the factors in drug misuse (by the elderly) is the
amount of elderly-specific information that comes from clinical
trials and then goes to physicians to guide their prescribing
practices,'' said Susan Raetzman, an AARP research analyst.
   The proposal would require manufacturers to include in physician
labeling all available information on the effects of the drug on
the elderly. This information could come from the clinical trials
in which the drug was tested before it was approved for commercial
sale, or from medical literature.

   Game 11 of the world chess championship ended in

   The draw was agreed to Monday night after only 24 moves.

<HEAD>Imperial Family-Related Shrine in Southern Japan Catches Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shinto shrine in southern Japan built to honor a
legendary emperor caught fire early today, and police said they
suspected arson by radicals opposed to next week's coronation of
Emperor Akihito.
   The roof of a wooden gate leading to the Kibaru Hachiman-sa
shrine on the southern island of Kyushu and a nearby barn were
damaged in the fire, police said. The blaze, which broke out
shortly after midnight, was quickly extinguished and there were no
injuries.
   Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is closely associated with
the monarchy and radical groups that link the monarch to Japan's
militarist past have vowed to ``destroy'' Monday's coronation.
   Authorities believe radicals were also behind a fire at a Shinto
shrine on Okinawa Island on Monday and a bombing attack on a police
dormitory in Tokyo that killed one policeman and injured six people
on Thursday.
   Kibaru Hachiman-sha is believed to have been built in the late
fourth century to honor the 12th Emperor, Keiko.
   Meanwhile, police said that they toda6y raided 20 sites in
northern Tokyo used by the left-wing radical group Kakurokyo, or
Revolutionary Workers Association.
   Police said they seized 29 items, including documents and
wireless transmitters, from the group's office in Utsunomiya
University and from leaders' homes.
   Some news reports said police believe a faction within the
Kakurokyo, which has about 800 members, was responsible for
Thursday's dormitory attack. Members of the radical group have
denied involvement.
   The attacks have heightened fears that police efforts to guard
the coronation may not prevent trouble.
   Police are mounting their largest security operation ever, with
26,000 officers - more than half the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department - already deployed on coronation-related assignments.

   ``Ghost'' materialized as Hollywood's biggest
moneymaker of the year, while the hallucinatory thriller ``Jacob's
Ladder'' climbed to the top of the box office over the weekend
despite deadly reviews.
   Paramount Pictures said ``Ghost'' is now the 12th
highest-grossing North American release ever, behind ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   ``Ghost'' passed ``Pretty Woman'' for 1990's top spot on Friday
and has made $180.6 million after 17 weeks in release. The sleeper
hit was written by Bruce Joel Rubin, who also wrote ``Jacob's
Ladder,'' and directed by Jerry Zucker.
   ``It's a movie that makes people laugh, cry, think and scares
them a little bit,'' Zucker said in explaining the appeal of
``Ghost,'' which stars Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. ``There's
romance in it, too. Audiences respond with a gut reaction.''
   ``Reviewers go to movies with their minds,'' he said.
``Audiences go to movies with their hearts.''
   ``Jacob's Ladder,'' the strange and poorly reviewed account of a
soldier's dream, collected $7.5 million in its premiere weekend.
The movie stars Tim Robbins.
   In second was the Kirstie Alley farce ``Sibling Rivalry.'' It
made $3.25 million.
   ``Ghost'' was third for the weekend with $3.22 million.
   Fourth was the May-December,
love-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks romance ``White Palace,''
with ticket sales of $3 million. It was followed by the
martial-arts thriller ``Marked for Death'' on a gate of $2.58
million.
   ``Stephen King's Graveyard Shift'' plummeted from first place
during the weekend before Halloween to sixth, with $2.55 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, tota  gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Jacob's Ladder,'' Tri-Star, $7.5 million, 1,052 screens,
$7,130 per screen, $7.5 million, one week.
   2. ``Sibling Rivalry,'' Columbia, $3.25 million, 1,603 screens,
$2,248 per screen, $8.4 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $3.22 million, 1,713 screens, $1,879
per screen, $180.6 million, 17 weeks.
   4. ``White Palace,'' Universal, $3 million, 892 screens, $3,370
per screen, $9.1 million, four weeks.
   5. ``Marked for Death,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.58 million, 1,553
screens, $1,664 per screen, $37.5 million, five weeks.
   6. ``Stephen King's Graveyard Shift,'' Paramount, $2.55 million,
1,603 screens, $1,593 per screen, $9 million, two weeks.
   7. ``Memphis Belle,'' Warner Bros., $2.48 million, 1,300
screens, $1,909 per screen, $19 million, four weeks.
   8. ``Graffiti Bridge,'' Warner Bros., $2.45 million, 688
screens, $3,557 per screen, $2.45 million, one week.

   The dollar inched down further against the Japanese
yen today, and share prices fell too amid pessimism over the U.S.
economy and the Persian Gulf situation.
   The dollar closed at 127.20 yen, down 0.15 yen from Monday's
close of 127.35 yen, but up 0.80 yen from its opening rate of
126.40 yen and New York's 126.55 yen late Monday. The dollar ranged
between 126.35 yen and 127.30 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 3.50 yen in the last three trading
days.
   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell
419.58 points, or 1.72 percent, to 23,965.75 in thin trading. The
index gained 190.34 points Monday.
   The price of the No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds was
quoted at 84.77 points, down from late Monday's 85.05. Their yield
was 7.755 percent, up from 7.690.
   Dubai oil for December delivery was valued at $27.45 to $27.55 a
barrel, or or about 10 to 20 cents above levels late Monday in New
York.
   The dollar, after opening lower in response to its decline on
overseas markets, inched up on buy orders from institutional
investors trying to cover short positions, dealers said.
   Also lending support was a British newspaper report that the
United States and Britain had decided to launch an attack on Iraq
by this weekend, said Koichiro Amaya, a dealer with Chemical Bank.
   Amaya said the Daily Star's report prompted some investors to
buy the dollar.
   However, Amaya said that because of general pessimism about the
U.S. economy, traders were expected to shun the dollar for the time
being unless there were new developments.
   Spot transactions totaled $11.251 billion, down from Monday's
$13.563 billion.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index gained some 250 points in
early trading, then turned down.
   ``The underlying worries about the Middle East situation,
together with concerns about the congressional elections and a
quarterly bond auction in the United States later this week,
provided excuses to investors not to buy,'' said Toshiyuki
Nishiguchi, an analyst with Daiwa Securities.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 280 million shares,
up from Monday's 214 million shares, but down from 313.3 million
shares Friday.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers 755 to 187, while 151
others remained unchanged.

<HEAD>Voters Decide on Tax, Environment, Abortion Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENT KILPATRICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The environment, taxes and whether politicians should be turned
out of office before they get too comfortable in the job confronted
voters today as they tackled 236 ballot questions in 43 states and
the District of Columbia.
   Alaskans could make the private use of marijuana a crime,
Arizona voters could declare Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a
state holiday, and Oregon residents could give parents a $2,500 tax
credit for sending a child to the public, parochial or private
school of their choice.
   In California, Washington and Missouri, environmentalists looked
to the voters to adopt measures protecting forests, coasts and
other sensitive lands.
   The tax revolt faced an important Election Day as well. Citizen
initiatives that would cut or limit taxes or hold down government
spending were on the ballot in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oregon and
other states.
   Many of the anti-tax and environmental proposals appeared to be
in trouble or in close races, according to recent polls.
   Politicians were at issue in proposals in California and
Colorado to limit how long they may hold office. The measures were
expected to win passage.
   ``The mood is real simple: Folks are really ticked or fed up
with how legislative bodies are conducting themselves,'' said Los
Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum.
   Jim Monaghan, a Denver political consultant, said, ``One of the
most disturbing things in politics is that it is one of a few
professions where people aren't expected to tell the truth and get
away with it.''
   Voters in Oregon decided on two proposals to limit abortions,
while the Nevada ballot had a measure to make it harder to change
that state's liberal abortion law.
   The issue of what is a family was the focus in two local
elections. The Seattle ballot contained an initiative to repeal
health insurance and other benefits for unmarried partners of
municipal employees. San Francisco voters decided whether to allow
unmarried couples to register as formal partnerships, although no
benefits would be required.
   Massachusetts voters were deciding the most drastic tax measure
- the repeal of two income tax increases and a rollback in state
fees to 1988 levels. Opponents estimated it would cut the state
budget by $2.6 billion, or about 15 percent, and force widespread
cuts in services.
   A proposal in Nebraska - dubbed the ``2 Percent Solution'' -
would cap increases in state and local government spending at 2
percent a year. An initiative in Oregon would limit property tax
increases to 1.5 percent a year by 1996, and a Utah measure would
repeal the state sales tax on most food.
   Tax or spending measures also were on the ballots in California,
Colorado, Florida and Montana.
   Much of the attention of environmentalists was focused on
California's ``Big Green'' initiative that would phase out many
pesticides, ban oil development in state waters, ban chemicals that
harm the ozone and require a dramatic reduction in emissions of
gases that contribute to global warming.
   The proposal was one of four on the California ballot related to
the environment, including one to regulate the use of forests. The
other two were less stringent proposals backed by business groups
as alternatives to ``Big Green'' and the forestry measure.
   Washington voters decided whether to require the state to limit
development in sensitive areas and to set up boards for mandatory
land use planning at the local level.
   Missourians considered sweeping protections for mountain streams
in the scenic Ozarks. Oregon voters could impose strict recycling
requirements and force the shutdown of the state's only nuclear
plant.
   South Dakotans could limit Black Hills mining and restrict
dumping, and voters in Arizona and Minnesota could dedicate
portions of lottery proceeds to preserving the environment.
   In other ballot questions:
   -Floridians considered making their state the first with a
constitutional waiting period for buying handguns.
   -Montana residents voted on making their cigarette tax the
highest in the nation to curb smoking.
   -Maine voters considered abolishing the state's tough blue laws,
which force most big retailers to close on Sundays.
   -District of Columbia voters decided on restoring the right of
the homeless to overnight shelter.
   Voters in the Staten Island borough of New York City and in
predominantly black neighborhoods of Boston decided whether to
begin studies on seceding from their cities.
   In Gwinnett County, Ga., voters considered a 1 percent sales tax
to pay for expanding Atlanta's rapid transit system into the
suburban area.
   Across the continent, in California, voters in Santa Clara
County considered a utility tax to finance a new stadium to lure
the San Francisco Giants, and residents of Sacramento voted on a
city-county merger that would make it the nation's seventh-largest
city.

<TEXT>
   In the United States' first reported
contact with the PLO since it broke off a dialogue in May, U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering has met with a PLO envoy to discuss the
plight of Palestinians.
   Pickering was acting as Security Council president at the
meeting Monday night, which was called to discuss the PLO's call
for U.N. observers to protect Palestinians in Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Washington severed its dialogue with he Palestine Liberation
Organization in May after an attack by a radical PLO faction on an
Israeli beach.
   Both sides said Monday's meeting was businesslike, related only
to Security Council business on the occupied territories. They said
there was no hint of resuming the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   Pickering said nonaligned nations had formally requested an
urgent meeting of the 15-member Security Council to discuss the
latest violence in the Gaza Strip. No meeting was set. The PLO said
it hoped for a meeting today or Wednesday at the latest.
   Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Jordan, met
the PLO's acting permanent observer, M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, for a half
hour.
   U.S. diplomats emphasized that Pickering met Kidwa strictly in
his role as president of the Security Council for November. The
presidency rotates monthly among the 15 members.
   Pickering said only that the PLO discussed its position with him
concerning a council meeting and its call for U.N. observers. He
declined to elaborate.
   Earlier Monday, the PLO proposed a resolution asking the
Security Council to send unarmed U.N. observers to protect
Palestinians in the territories captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
   It also called for the parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva
Convention - on protection of civilians in time of war - to hold an
unprecedented meeting to protect Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   The proposed PLO resolution says the council ``decides to
establish immediately under its authority a U.N. Observer Force,
and to dispatch it to the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel
since 1967, including Jerusalem.''
   Israel rejects the presence of observers as a violation of its
sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured
in 1967 from Jordan and Egypt.

   For decades, neutral Sweden and Finland
never considered entering the Common Market.
   Now, the end of East-West rivalries and the prospect of economic
difficulties ahead may combine to bring the countries on Europe's
northern tier in from the cold.
   Last week, the image of Nordic self-sufficiency and
disengagement suddenly came apart. Sweden announced its intention
to join the European Community and angered Finland by calling for a
joint Nordic application.
   In Norway, where voters said ``no'' to membership in a
referendum 18 years ago, the governing coalition collapsed when its
smallest partner opposed trade negotiations with the community. The
new Laborite government favors the talks.
   Of the other two Nordic nations, Denmark already is a member,
while Iceland is opposed to joining.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson says the end of the Cold War and
the prospects for a new all-European security system clear the way
for neutral countries like Sweden to join the European Community.
   Observers have called Sweden's intention to join the community
the biggest turnaround in Swedish foreign policy since shortly
after World War II.
   Wilhelm Agrell, a leading security policy expert, called it
``the most important political crossroads since 1948-49,'' when
Sweden tried to organize a Scandinavian defense association.
   The government's change of position was announced in an
emergency economic package presented last week, and observers
agreed it was forced by economic concerns. The package itself made
major changes in domestic policy, deeply cutting the welfare system
the Social Democratic Party built.
   Economic observers said the ``declaration of intention'' to join
the Common Market was an attempt to calm Swedish industry, which
has made massive investments in community countries.
   The Swedish concerns do not want to be closed out of their main
export market in 1993, when community nations are to unite in
economic union.
   The investments had caused a large outflow of Swedish currency,
intensifying a drop in the krona's strength and an increase in
devaluation speculation before the package was announced.
   The Swedish announcement caused consternation at the European
Community's Brussels headquarters and among fellow European Free
Trade Association countries, which are currently negotiating an
agreement that would link the two trade associations.
   Critics say the Swedish initiative renders the negotiations -
which also involve Norway, Finland, Iceland, Austria and
Switzerland - pointless.
   Finland, an avowedly neutral country with traditionally strong
ties to the Soviet Union, has recently begun discussing future
European Community membership.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a year ago that
Moscow would not object to Finland joining the community.
   But when Andersson was quoted as saying Nordic countries could
start discussing a joint European Community application next year,
Finland's President Mauno Koivisto said the statement was
premature.
   Risto Penttila, a researcher at the Finnish Foreign Policy
Institute, said that Finland could be in a problematic position in
the future if there is friction between the Soviet Union and the
European Community.
   Finland shares a long common border with the Soviet Union.
   For their part, Norwegians appear to be warming to the idea of
European Community membership.
   A poll of 607 people conducted by the MMI survey institute in
late October showed 38 percent favored membership, 33 percent
opposed it and 29 percent were undecided. No margin for error was
given.

<HEAD>Volvo Agrees to Pull `Monster Truck' Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TV commercial in which a Volvo withstands
attempts by a ``monster truck'' to crush it has been dropped by the
automaker under pressure after it turned out the car had been
reinforced with steel or wood.
   ``Volvo was touted as a car that you can believe in.
Unfortunately, these ads, you could not believe in them,'' said
Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, who had challenged the
commercial. The ad was broadcast nationally.
   William Hoover, senior vice president of Volvo Cars of North
America, emphasized on Monday that independent studies have found
that Volvos are ``among the safest, if not the absolute safest,
cars on the road today.''
   But he said, ``We agree that the consumers in the state of
Texas, as well as consumers throughout the country, deserve better
advertising.''
   Volvo agreed to make no unproven claims, run corrective
newspaper ads and pay the state $316,250 in investigative costs.
   The automaker admitted no wrongdoing.
   In the ad, filmed in Austin in June, a Volvo appears to be the
only car left standing after being run over by a large-tire pickup.
The ad is a dramatization of a 1988 Vermont event, according to the
company.
   However, the ad is not billed as a dramatization. And Mattox
said the other cars in the ad were weakened structurally, while the
Volvo was reinforced.
   The modifications were made to ensure the crew's safety and
allow the Volvo to withstand the number of runs required by the
truck in filming, the company said.
   Some of the shots of the truck running over the Volvo also may
have been fabricated, Mattox said.

low temperatures.
   The tail of the storm produced flurries in the Detroit area and
rain elsewhere in Michigan.
   More snow - up to five inches - was forecast today across the
Midwest into Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.
   The Northeast looked for early rain, followed by mostly, sunny
windy weather. Mostly sunny skies were forecast for the far West,
Southwest, Texas and Southeast.
   Winds of 60 mph and stronger were forecast through tonight in
California's Sierra Nevada.
   Stormy weather is forecast through Wednesday in the northwest

<HEAD>Navajos Say Weathering Corruption Scandal Will Make Tribe Stronger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The corruption scandal that drove
Navajo chairman Peter MacDonald from office and shook the tribe's
political institutions will eventually result in a stronger, more
honest government, some officials say.
   The scandal broke wide open two years ago when the Navajo
council suspended MacDonald, its four-term chairman, amid
allegations he took money and gifts in exchange for favors to those
doing business with the biggest U.S. Indian tribe.
   MacDonald, convicted Sept. 17 of bribery, theft, extortion and
conspiracy, was sentenced to six years in prison and disqualified
from holding tribal office. His son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr.,
36, was sentenced to 1{ years.
   ``The days of an imperial chairmanship are over,'' said Al
Bennett, who provided security for several tribal council members
during the corruption case's most bitter moments. Two men were shot
to death during a clash between MacDonald supporters and Navajo
police in 1989.
   ``The favoritism (of) the old days is slowly being phased out,''
Bennett added. ``What the turmoil has done has strengthened the
court system of the Navajo Nation and strengthened the council's
power. It has brought the executive branch in line with the
distribution of power.''
   The scandal gave birth to a three-branch form of government for
the 180,000 Navajos living on the 21,000-square-mile reservation in
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
   The new government, established in April, has already curbed
abuses of power by splitting authority between the tribal chairman,
the leader of the tribal council and the tribal courts, said Navajo
Councilman Daniel Tso.
   He said the judicial branch in particular demonstrated its
independence during MacDonald's trial.
   ``(Its judges) didn't yield to MacDonald or to the violence that
occurred,'' he said.
   At the time of his conviction, MacDonald was seeking election to
the new position of tribal president. His name was struck from the
ballot, and the election was postponed from today to Dec. 18.
   Interim President Leonard Haskie will take MacDonald's place on
the ballot against former Tribal Chairman Peterson Zah.
   Navajo legal advocate Carol Retasket, who defended MacDonald,
complained that his punishment was too severe, but she agreed that
the scandal should strengthen Navajo political institutions in the
long run.
   Before MacDonald, she said, Navajos viewed theft by political
leaders not as a crime but as a quirk to be punished by ridicule.
   Duane Beyal, spokesman for the tribe's legislative branch,
likened the Navajos' problems to the growing pains of a new
government. ``The U.S. government went through the same thing,'' he
said. ``Like any adolescent, you're clumsy and awkward.''

<HEAD>Hungary Joins Council of Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary joined the Council of Europe today, becoming
the first former East bloc country to enter the oldest postwar body
promoting European cooperation.
   ``When the time came, Hungary was bold enough to open a hole in
the Iron Curtain,'' said Catherine Lalumiere, secretary-general of
the council.
   ``The leaders and indeed the people have contributed so much to
bringing the division of Europe to an end.''
   She and Foreign Minister Geza Jeszensky of Hungary sat at a
table in a gilt-trimmed room of the 17th-century Barberini Palace
to sign documents admitting Hungary as the 24th member of the
council.
   ``I feel deeply moved standing in front of you,'' Jeszensky told
the audience of European ministers. ``This is a momentous day in
history, both for Hungary, and, I believe, the Council of Europe.''
   Czechoslovakia and Poland, who like Hungary have made a
dramatic, peaceful switch from Communist dictatorship to democracy,
are expected to also join the council in the coming months.
   The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have observer status
and Romania and Albania may become observers soon.
   The Council of Europe, which includes nearly all Western
European countries, has produced 130 international treaties. It is
best known for the European Human Rights Convention and European
Court of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding on council
members.
   Jeszensky signed the human rights treaty at today's ceremony. A
country must sign the accord and have a parliamentary democracy to
join the 41-year-old council.
   After the signing, Hungary's flag was raised along those of the
other 23 nations at the Council of Europe offices in Strasbourg,
France, as the national anthem was played.
   ``Hungary's admission is the first step in the restoration of
the unity of our continent,'' Jeszensky said.
   He added that joining the council was ``one of the most
important foreign policy successes of the Hungarian government.''
   Hungary applied for membership in the council a year ago, when
reform Communists were still in power. A government dominated by
the center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum was formed last summer
after the country's first free multiparty elections in four
decades.
   Today's ceremony opened a daylong meeting of the foreign
ministers of Council nations.
   The Council is trying to decide what role it will have in the
post-Cold War order. It is seeking to increase its influence in
human rights issues and possibly develop a parliament bringing
together the United States, Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The Council's other members are: Austria, Belgium, Britain,
Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
Turkey.

<HEAD>Four Blacks Die In Renewed Clashes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today that four
blacks were killed, including one shot by the army, in a township
near Johannesburg where more than 20 people have died in several
days of black factional fighting.
   The killings occurred in Bekkersdal, where black students
demanding a boycott of final exams to protest school conditions
have clashed with pupils who want to take the tests.
   Police said they found the bodies of three people who were
killed Monday by a crowd. The police statement did not indicate
anything about the affiliation of the attackers or their victims.
   A man also died when he was shot by soldiers after he resisted
arrest and attacked the troops with a knife, police said.
   At least 23 people have died in the township 40 miles west of
Johannesburg since Thursday, according to police, who believe most
of the killings are linked to the student violence.
   Schools have been empty this week, many workers have stayed
home, businesses have been closed and some families have fled in
search of safety.
   Police said several people were hurt, seven were arrested, and
houses were set on fire in clashes on Monday. Authorities said they
confiscated two AK-47 assault rifles from the house of a man who
belongs to the Pan Africanist Congress, a militant black opposition
group.
   Militant students are opposed to the year-end exams, which
determine whether students advance to the next grade or gain
admission to universities. They say they have not been able to
prepare properly because of poor conditions at the schools.
   Last year, 42 percent of black high school seniors nationwide
passed the final exam, compared to a pass rate of more than 95
percent for white students.
   The white-led government spends about five times as much to
educate a white pupil as a black pupil, and anti-apartheid
activists have complained for years about problems in the black
schools.
   More than 800 blacks have died since August in factional
fighting in the black townships around Johannesburg. Most of the
battles have been between supporters of the African National
Congress and the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party, the two
largest black opposition groups.

<TEXT>
   A stockbroker pleaded guilty to trading
stocks on the basis of tips from a printing plant employee about
which companies were going to be mentioned in upcoming issues of
Business Week magazine.
   John Petit, 34, faces up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines at sentencing March 25. He pleaded guilty Monday to
securities fraud.
   Petit, now of Boca Raton, Fla., earned more than $66,000 from
1986 to 1988 by buying stocks he knew would be mentioned in
Business Week's ``Inside Wall Street'' column before readers could
bid up the price, prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors said Petit was tipped off by Shayne Walters, a
worker at the plant where the magazine was printed.
   At the time, Petit worked in a Newport Beach office of Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Walters pleaded guilty earlier in federal court in New York to
conspiracy to commit fraud and perjury, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Alice Hill.
   In August, as part of an SEC civil action, stockbroker Brian J.
Callahan and print shop worker William N. Jackson were ordered to
pay a total of more than $66,000 in ill-gotten profits and fines
involving similar advance access to the Business Week column.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's special envoy to the Middle
East has told Western diplomats that his country is not ruling out
the use of force against Iraq, the British Broadcasting Corp. has
reported.
   The BBC reported Monday that Yevgeny Primakov told ambassadors
in Moscow that a translator in Paris had erred last week in
interpreting Gorbachev as saying a military option was
``unacceptable.''
   Primakov has traveled twice to Baghdad for meetings with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in an effort to find a peaceful solution
to the crisis precipitated by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The BBC said Primakov told the ambassadors that the Soviet Union
continues to insist on full implementation of the U.N. resolutions
ordering an embargo on trade with Iraq and demanding an immediate
and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Primakov also said there was no sign of the Soviet Union
breaking with the international consensus, the BBC reported.
   The Soviet envoy was evasive on what the Soviet Union would do
in the event of war in the Persian Gulf, it said.
   Soviet participation in military action would have to be
approved by the country's Parliament, the BBC quoted Primakov as
saying.
   Primakov said he found no evidence of popular dissatisfaction
when he visited Iraq, and advised the ambassadors that domestic
difficulties would not undermine Saddam's position, the BBC said.
   The BBC reported that Primakov told the briefing that the
embargo appeared to be working, but only very slowly.
   Saddam is doubly determined not to be forced out of Kuwait
empty-handed after his experience with the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war, the BBC quoted Primakov as telling the ambassadors.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Southern Baptists nationwide
are considering state budgets that could deepen the decade-old
split between conservatives and moderates in the nation's largest
Protestant denomination.
   Moderates in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina are
pushing for spending plans that would withhold contributions from
some of the church's national programs in which the conservatives,
or fundamentalists, hold way.
   Such contributions support missionary, educational and
benevolent work.
   If the spending plans are approved, they could wreck the
national budget adopted in June for the 14.9 million Southern
Baptists.
   ``We are going to have churches torn apart, families torn apart,
ministers torn apart,'' said Neil Jones, a moderate pastor of
Columbia Baptist Church in Falls Church. ``Some of my good friends
are preachers on the other side.''
   ``The most damaging thing it will result in is a weakening of
missions and fewer souls being saved, and more souls going to hell
for eternity,'' said T.C. Pinckney, a conservative member of
Alexandria Good News Baptist Church.
   Conservatives believe in the literal truth of the Bible.
Moderates say the Bible is open to individual interpretation.
   The conservatives dominate the Southern Baptists. In the past 12
years they have gained control over many seminaries and national
boards and forced out leaders who disagree with them.
   Representatives from churches in 21 states will hold separate
meetings Nov. 12-14 to approve their spending plans. The
denomination is based in Nashville, Tenn.
   The moderates' plans would restrict or cut off money for such
programs as the church's executive committee, the Southeastern
Baptist Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., and the Christian Life
Commission. The commission determines the Southern Baptists'
position on social and ethical issues.
   Less money also would be sent to the Southern Baptist
Convention's Cooperative Program, the denomination's major funding
program.
   In Virginia, where moderates continue to wield influence, their
plan urges more money for the new Associated Baptist Press. The
group was chartered after editors of the Baptist Press were fired
by conservatives.
   Pinckney said the spending dispute, while keeping the
denomination together, ``diverts our attention and resources away
from winning souls.''
   ``If that's the alternative to a split,'' he said, ``then it's
probably better in the long run for everybody on both sides that a
split occur.''

   Mimi, the 17{-pound lobster described as the
Elizabeth Taylor of crustaceans, died of natural causes days after
being shipped to her new home - at a restaurant. She was 20 to 100
years old, officials said.
   Mimi, captured last week off the Maine coast and flown to
Detroit, died Sunday in the tank at Carl's Chop House, which paid
$320 for the huge lobster.
   ``She had quit moving. I picked her up. She still didn't move,''
said Barry Hornecker, executive chef at Carl's.
   So he chilled and poached Mimi and began making plans for a
feast.
   ``Mimi was like Elizabeth Taylor. ... She was always
beautiful,'' said Jim Richards, owner of the Long Wharf Lobster
Co., which flew the lobster to Detroit.
   Although Mimi was a lot bigger than the 1{-pound average
lobster, she wasn't the biggest. Earlier this year, Florida's Sea
World adopted a 19-pound lobster, whose age was estimated at 100
years, from a grocery store in Oklahoma.
   The largest known lobster lives in a museum in Maine. It weighs
58 pounds and is estimated to be 300 years old.

<HEAD>European Leaders Urge Worldwide Action to Fight Global Warming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said
today there is a ``clear case'' for immediate worldwide action
against global warming and said foot-dragging could spell disaster.
   More research is needed on a potential climate upheaval next
century, but that ``should not be an excuse'' for delay, Mrs.
Thatcher said in a keynote speech to ministers meeting on the
issue.
   ``We will not succeed if we are too inflexible,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said. ``And succeed we must for the sake of this and future
generations.''
   French Prime Minister Michel Rocard told the officials from
about 120 countries they face a ``race against time ... to save our
planet.''
   In an appeal believed aimed largely at the United States and the
Soviet Union, Mrs. Thatcher demanded all countries begin work on
binding commitments to limit emissions of so-called greenhouse
gases.
   The commitments would be part of a global treaty on climate
change, to be completed in 1992.
   Washington and Moscow are resisting the setting of targets now.
They argue more study is needed to justify huge expenditures on
emission controls.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are the biggest sources
of man-made carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, much of which
comes from burning fossil fuels.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Rocard spoke as top officials were wrapping up
a U.N. conference on climate change. The gathering was aimed at
giving momentum to negotiations on global warming, due to start in
February.
   Scientists from 100 countries who met last week issued a united
appeal for immediate steps to counter pollution from gases trapping
heat in the atmosphere.
   Officials drafting a political declaration to cap the meeting
Wednesday are facing a clash between European Community efforts to
urge quick action and the less enthusiastic U.S. stand.
   Mrs. Thatcher conceded ``much more research is needed.''
   But she added: ``There is already a clear case for precautionary
action.''
   Many steps would be ``sensible in any event'' - improving energy
efficiency, developing alternative sources of supply,
reforestation, rethinking industrial processes and tackling the
waste problem, she said.
   Less air pollution, reduced acid rain and lower energy costs are
desirable in any case, she said.
   Both Mrs. Thatcher and Rocard offered their government's support
to help developing countries cope with the research and vast
technical resources required to help in the fight against warming.
   ``The cost of inaction would be much too great to risk,'' said
Rocard.
   He said Wednesday's ministerial declaration should have ``real
content,'' setting objectives and deadlines.
   He cited as a model an EC agreement last week to stabilize
carbon dioxide emissions at current levels by the start of next
century. Six other countries, grouped in the European Free Trade
Association, joined that effort Monday.
   However, a draft of the concluding ministerial declaration sets
no targets, reflecting the U.S. approach.
   The United States, which has sent a lower-level delegation, did
not immediately take the floor at the U.N.-sponsored gathering.
   Among the feared results of global warming are higher sea levels
that would displace coastal dwellers, a disruption of agriculture,
and vast changes affecting wildlife.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister today warned
Iraq the United Nations has not restricted the use of military
force to liberate Kuwait.
   Prince Saud's assertion at a news conference in Jiddah, Saudia
Arabia, as he saw Secretary of State James A. Baker III off to
Egypt marked a hardening of the anti-Iraq coalition.
   ``We would like a peaceful settlement, but that option is in the
hands of the Iraqis,'' the foreign minister said.
   He confirmed, meanwhile, that King Fahd and Baker had devised a
joint command in the event of war.
   U.S. troops defending Saudi Arabia would be under the joint
command, but if the Americans go into combat elsewhere in the
Persian Gulf they would take orders only from U.S. commanders.
   Saud said Baker had not discussed military options with the
Saudis during his talks Monday in Jiddah.
   However, Saud said the U.N. resolutions demanding that Iraq give
up Kuwait do not foreclose force.
   ``The United Nations has not put any restrictions on what
actions the United Nations would take to implement this,'' Saud
said.
   In Cairo, Baker was seeking reaffirmation of Egypt's role in the
U.S.-led coalition against Iraq.
   He met with President Hosni Mubarak, who has sent about 14,000
troops to defend Saudi Arabia and may double that number.
   There was no immediate appraisal of the meeting with Mubarak.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
Mubarak canceled his appearance at a planned joint news conference,
saying he had another appointment. Baker decided not to appear
without the president, Tutwiler said.
   Baker later met at Cairo International Airport with China's
foreign minister, Qian Qichen. As they posed for pictures, the
Chinese official dodged a question about whether his government
would support military action against Iraq.
   ``All the armed forces have two roles to play,'' he said. ``One
is to fight a war, and the other is to seek peace.''
   Asked if by authorizing the use of force the United Nations
would increase pressure on Iraq to release its hold on Kuwait, the
foreign minister again avoided a direct reply.
   ``We'll still have to wait and see,'' he said. The 10
resolutions approved by the U.N. Security Council, Qian said, ``are
intended to increase the pressure on Iraq to reach a peaceful
settlement.''
   The Bush administration needs the support of China, a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council, for further economic and
political moves against Iraq - or military action, if that is taken
- to reverse the ocupation of Kuwait.
   Baker reached agreement Monday with King Fahd that U.S. troops
will be under American command if they are sent into combat.
   The decision on command and control was announced after Baker
held a two-hour meeting with the king.
   A U.S. official, who insisted on anonymity, said the Saudis
would play a decisive role in two ways - they would share command
of American troops used to defend Saudi Arabia and would have to
give a green light before the 100,000-plus U.S. troops in the
oil-rich kingdom were sent into action.
   Once the Americans go into battle outside Saudi Arabia, American
commanders will direct them, the official said.
   Baker and the king resolved the issue as tensions appeared to
heighten over Iraq's annexation of Kuwait three months ago.
   A senior Saudi official said ``we are satisfied'' and from the
kingdom's standpoint there had never been a problem.
   The Saudi official, who talked to reporters under condition of
anonymity, said ``we are still genuinely hoping to see a peaceful
outcome.''
   Baker, leaving the Saudi mountain resort of Taif earlier Monday
after talks with the exiled emir of Kuwait, said the situation was
changing.
   ``This crisis is entering a new phase,'' he said, ``and while we
are still seeking a peaceful political and diplomatic solution, we
have to put ourselves in a position where we would be able to
exercise any options that might be available.''
   Baker did not elaborate, but the U.S. official said he meant the
United States and its allies were bringing ``increasing pressure''
to bear on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The secretary implied a heightening of tensions in the region
and a redoubled U.S. resolve to evict Iraq from Kuwait. ``I don't
think that we can or should we rule out resort to force if that
should be necessary,'' he said.
   Baker is on a seven-country trip designed to test support among
Arabs, Europeans and the Soviets for military action against
Saddam.
   Of critical importance are the opinions Baker hears from leaders
of Saudi Arabia, the linchpin in the Arab alliance, and from Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on Thursday.

   President Saddam Hussein today ordered
106 more foreigners freed, including some detained at strategic
sites as part of his ``human shield'' against attack.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said those being allowed to leave
are 77 Japanese, 20 Italians, five Swedes, two Germans and two
Portuguese.
   The announcement indicated Saddam is continuing his practice of
selectively freeing foreigners held since his troops seized Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   The Iraqi president has used the hostages - including hundreds
of Americans - to try to splinter the alliance against him.
   The dispatch said some of the foreigners to be freed are
``guests,'' the term the Iraqi media use for those held as part of
Saddam's ``human shield'' against attacks by the U.S.-led forces
assembled in the Persian Gulf.
   An estimated 600 foreigners are held at strategic sites, mainly
Americans, Britons, Germans and Japanese.
   INA said Saddam's order was in response to appeals made by
various delegations that visited Iraq in recent days. It mentioned
specifically former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, a
delegation of Swedish Moslems and a parliamentary delegation from
Italy.
   It said those to be allowed to leave include 15 construction
workers - 10 Italians, two Germans, two Portuguese and a Swede.
   They are being freed, INA said in the dispatch monitored in
Nicosia, in response to appeals by the Arab Union of Laborers. The
agency did not provide the names of those to be freed, nor say when
they could leave.

   An American has been missing since
last month in northern Luzon and may have been kidnapped by
Communist rebels, U.S. and Philippine officials said today.
   A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Harvey Drown, believed to be from California or Washington,
was reportedly taken at gunpoint from a vehicle Oct. 24 in Cagayan
province 270 miles north of Manila.
   Police Col. Miguel Fontanilla said in a report that the American
was on board a jeep near the town of Aparri when it was stopped by
a rebel checkpoint.
   Fontanilla's report identified the American as a Protestant
missionary but gave no details about his denomination nor how long
he had lived in the country.
   U.S. officials said Drown had not registered with the embassy in
Manila and they were unaware of him until receiving fragmentary
reports of his possible abduction.
   American and Philippine authorities said no demands had been
made by the American's kidnappers. U.S. officials said they doubted
the incident was linked to this week's scheduled resumption of
talks on the future of U.S. military bases, whose lease expires
next year.
   Communist rebels oppose the bases.
   In May, Communist guerrillas in the central Philippine province
of Negros Occidental kidnapped U.S. Peace Corps volunteer Timothy
Swanson. He was released on August 2.
   U.S. authorities suspended Peace Corps operations in the
Philippines and ordered all volunteers home before Swanson's
release.

<TEXT>
   Jurors who convicted four men of crimes in
the death of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena said they discussed
media coverage of the trial and facts not admitted as evidence
during their deliberations.
   The jury convicted Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, Ruben Zuno Arce
and Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez of conspiracy, kidnapping and violent
crime in aid of racketeering in Camarena's slaying.
   Javier Vasquez Velasco was convicted of violent crimes in aid of
racketeering for the deaths of two Americans mistaken for U.S. drug
agents in Guadalajara, Mexico.
   Eight jurors testified in a hearing Monday before U.S. District
Judge Edward Rafeedie on defense claims that the jurors were
unfairly influenced by media reports about the case and their
clients should get a new trial.
   The 12-member jury discussed press accounts of the trial on July
28, the day after they convicted defendant Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros, the jurors said.
   ``We went back over the verdict,'' juror Linda Overholt said.
``We reconsidered everything because of what we heard. We wanted to
make sure of our feelings.''
   Other jurors testified that they reviewed their verdict only
briefly before moving on to the other defendants.
   Juror William R. Parris said the panel talked about a previous
drug conviction of Matta that was not introduced as evidence at the
Camarena trial.
   But other jurors said they didn't remember discussing the prior
conviction.
   Rafeedie gave defense lawyers 10 days to submit written
arguments supporting their claims.
   Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, was
abducted, tortured and killed in Guadalajara in 1985. Prosecutors
said members of a cocaine cartel ordered the killing because
Camarena's work had led to seizures of cocaine and marijuana.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Productivity Up 1.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers rose at
the fastest rate in two years in the July-September quarter,
climbing at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, the government said
today.
   However, the rebound is still well below the level needed to
significantly boost Americans' living standard, according to most
economists.
   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more
during each hour of work, is vital to increasing the nation's
standard of living without inflation.
   The 1.6 percent third quarter gain in non-farm productivity
reported by the Labor Department was a marked improvement over the
0.3 percent advance in the second quarter, revised from an earlier
estimate, which showed a 1.5 percent gain.
   It was also the biggest advance since productivity shot up at a
2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 1988.
   However, because productivity plunged at a 1.3 percent rate in
the first quarter, it is averaging only a scant 0.2 percent advance
for the first nine months of 1990.
   Still, that is better than the 0.7 percent decline for all of
1989. Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged around 1.4
percent a year - better than the 1.2 percent average in the 1970s,
but far worse than the 3.3 percent annual gain posted in the two
decades following World War II.
   During the July-September period, the number of hours worked
edged down 0.1 percent, the first decline in more than four years.
Economists say this is a sign that employers are preparing for a
recession by not hiring new workers or allowing existing employees
to work more hours.
   Hourly labor costs, a major indication of inflation for
businesses, shot up 4.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with
a 5 percent rise in the second quarter. Hourly labor costs advanced
at a 4.5 percent average for the year so far, compared with 3.2
percent for all of 1989.
   Meanwhile, unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price
inflation, rose 2.8 percent in the third quarter compared with 4.7
percent in the second quarter. For the year so far, unit labor
costs averaged a 4.3 percent gain compared with 3.9 percent in the
1989.
   Total business productivity, including farming, rose 1.9 percent
in the third quarter, bringing the average for the year so far to
up 0.5 percent compared with a decline of 0.5 percent in all of
1989.
   Manufacturing productivity climbed at a 5.6 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, bringing the average for the year so far to
4.5 percent, compared with 2.6 percent last year.

   SAINT-LAURENT-LES-BAINS, France (AP) - Heavily armed bandits
seeking cash at a wealthy, isolated monastery wounded a monk in a
gun battle with brothers who had taken up arms after a wave of
robberies.
   The Rev. Pierre-Marie, abbot of the 19th-century Trappist
monastery Notre-Dame des Neiges, said that a burglar alarm sounded
at the monastery about 3 a.m. Monday, an hour before morning
prayers.
   The bell signaled to the 36 monks, who produce 4 million bottles
of wine a year on their immense estate in the Languedoc region of
southern France, that they were being robbed for the third time
this year.
   The monks have been organizing themselves as a self-defense
force the past few weeks. In previous robberies, ``the telephone
lines were cut and we couldn't call for help,'' the abbot said
today.
   Arming themselves with shotguns, the brothers raced outside to a
nearby administrative building where the alarm had sounded.
   ``The alarm stopped after three rings, so the thieves were able
to believe they hadn't been discovered,'' the abbot said.
   But one brother blasted a round into the air, flushing two
masked men. They fled down the winding road to the monastery, the
abbot said.
   The bandits found their way barricaded by a parked car and
shotgun-toting Brother Zepherin, organizer of the monastery's
hunting expeditions, who demanded they stop.
   The robbers pulled out a sawed-off shotgun and a semiautomatic
pistol and opened fire on Brother Zepherin and other monks
approaching in cars.
   The monks returned fire.
   Brother Zepherin fell with 200 pellets in his leg.
   The robbers got into a waiting car with one or two accomplices
inside and sped off empty handed, the abbot said.
   They were still at large today.

<HEAD>Bush Votes After Signing Tax-Raising Budget Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Recasts lead and SUBS 7th graf, The president... to make clear
that $492 billion package signed by Bush includes both tax
increases and budget reductions</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush cast his vote in his home state
today after signing a tax hike as part of a $492 billion deficit
reduction plan that was a campaign albatross for many fellow
Republicans.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, waited in line behind other voters
for about 10 minutes this morning at a polling place in a nursing
home near the hotel they use as a legal residence.
   He waved aside reporters' questions, saying only ``good to be
home'' as he left the polling place to return to Washington, where
he will spend the evening in the White House.
   The president signed the budget package Monday night at his
Houston home. The late hour guaranteed that the news would not make
prime-time news broadcasts and also would miss the deadlines for
many newspapers that voters would be reading on Election Day today.
   In a statement, Bush called the hard-fought budget compromise
``the centerpiece of the largest deficit reduction package in
history and an important measure for ensuring America's long-term
economic growth.''
   He said that in the agreement, ``No one got everything he or she
wanted, but the end product is a compromise that merits
enactment.''
   The bill Bush signed was a $245 billion, 5-year
deficit-reduction package. It was the major component of a
five-year plan reducing the budget gap by $492 billion. The
remaining savings came from defense cuts in other legislation, and
lower than planned interest payments on the national debt.
   Bush spent the home stretch of the campaign trekking to eight
states and urging voters to go to the polls and prove wrong the
pundits who say the electorate is depressed and disgusted.
   On Monday, Bush made a day-long swing around Texas with GOP
gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams.
   The deficit-reduction plan approved by Congress last week
includes $140 billion in new taxes that Bush agreed to, but that
election-conscious Republicans found hard to swallow. The plan also
included a number of government spending cuts.
   The president continued on Monday to emphasize upbeat themes at
the urging of some advisers that he try to look more
``presidential.''
   But his election-eve speech to a ballroom full of Republican
loyalists was interrupted by about four anti-war protesters who
chanted, ``No war for oil.'' The audience shouted them down and
they were quickly ushered from the room.
   The outburst gave Bush an opportunity to repeat his rationale
for sending more than 200,000 U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf
region.
   ``They got it wrong,'' he said, referring to the protesters.
``What we're doing is not anything about war for oil. What we're
doing is standing up against naked aggression.''
   Bush's appearances have increasingly attracted anti-war
protesters around the country.
   In the closing days of the campaign, the president's senior
advisers have been divided on how Bush should conduct himself, with
some recommending that he take off the gloves and bash
congressional Democrats, as he did in Oklahoma City 10 days ago.
   But sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
approach, favored by White House chief of staff John Sununu and
some high Republican Party officials, appeared to backfire. They
concluded that Democrat-bashing was not helping Bush's popularity,
which has foundered with his wavering positions on tax and budget
issues coupled with the slumping economy.
   The sources said Bush's former pollster, Robert Teeter, and his
1988 media consultant, Roger Ailes, persuaded the president to be
more positive.
   That approach was evident Monday, when Bush traveled with
Williams to Tyler and Waco.
   While still accusing Democrats of wanting to raise taxes on
``every working man and woman,'' Bush said he was tired of ``the
cynics, these Washington pundits ... telling us everything that's
wrong with the United States.''
   He said people should vote and ``show us what's right about
it.''
   Bush tried to shore up Williams' support, which has flagged with
recent gaffes. Williams admitted knowing nothing about the one
proposed constitutional amendment on the Texas statewide ballot, a
measure dealing with gubernatorial appointment powers.
   Williams also has had to fend off criticism that he paid no
taxes in 1986, a year when he said business was bad and he had no
income.
   But Bush said of Williams: ``I know of his sincerity. I know of
his integrity. And he will be a great governor of the state of
Texas. And I'm going to vote for him early tomorrow morning.''

<TEXT>
   Nawaz Sharif, a conservative
industrialist and Benazir Bhutto's chief rival, was sworn in today
as prime minister of Pakistan's fifth freely-elected government in
43 years.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan administered the oath of office to
the 41-year-old Sharif in a 10-minute ceremony attended by 600
guests, including politicians, military leaders and bureaucrats.
   Earlier today, the National Assembly elected Sharif prime
minister after a brief walkout by supporters of ousted Prime
Minister Bhutto, who demanded a secret ballot.
   Sharif, whose Islamic Democratic Alliance soundly defeated Ms.
Bhutto in the Oct. 24 election, sounded a conciliatory note today.
   ``The government and opposition should join hands to help the
country's poor,'' he said. ``For the prosperity of the country we
have to join hands.''
   He referred to the majority of Pakistan's 110 million people,
most of whom are illiterate and landless laborers earning less than
$400 a year.
   Earlier, in an address to the assembly, Ms. Bhutto sharply
criticized the army-back caretaker government that succeeded her
after she was dismissed from office Aug. 6.
   ``I hope the new administration will depart from the policy of
repression, persecution and discrimination launched by the
caretaker government,'' she said. ``Democracy to us is not just a
way to govern but a value.''
   Ms. Bhutto's candidate for prime minister, Mohammad Afzal Khan,
was a political unknown who was seen as her Pakistan People's
Party's sacrificial candidate. Sharif's election was virtually
assured when his alliance of 18 parties named him their candidate
for prime minister.
   He controls 105 seats in the 217-seat National Assembly, but
claims to have the support of several smaller parties and
independents. He was elected prime minister with 159 votes.
   Ms. Bhutto's party was routed in the national elections, leaving
her with 45 seats. Her candidate received 39 votes today.
   In provincial elections Oct. 27, Ms. Bhutto's party was
decimated in Punjab province, and weakened in her home province of
Sindh. She has repeatedly charged she was cheated out of victory.
   Sharif began his political career in the 1980s, during military
rule in Pakistan. His mentor, President Gen. Mohammad Zia-ul Haq,
died in a plane crash in 1988, paving the way for the first free
elections after more than a decade of military rule.
   Shortly before those elections, Sharif formed his democratic
alliance of parties espousing a wide range of political ideologies
but united in their contempt for Ms. Bhutto. Her party won the
largest bloc of votes in 1988, but required the support of smaller
parties and independents to stay in power.
   After 20 months and little legislation, President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government, charging her with
corruption and ineptitude. She discounted the charges.
   Ms. Bhutto faces seven charges of misconduct. A guilty verdict
on any one charge could disqualify her from politics for up to
seven years.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday ordered the release of
106 foreigners, including some who were held as ``human shields''
at key installations, Iraq's official news agency said.
   The report said those to be freed are 77 Japanese, 20 Italians,
five Swedes, two Portuguese. News of the planned
releases came one day after European countries denounced individual
attempts to gain the freedom of hostages.
   ---
   Secretary of Stwo Germans and tate James A. Baker III traveled to Egypt
for the
next leg of his weeklong trip to test the idea of military action
against Iraq. On Monday, Baker and Saudi King Fahd agreed that the
United States will not attack Iraq without Saudi approval, but that
American troops would be under U.S. command once they go to battle.
   ---
   Baker also met in Cairo with China's foreign minister, Qian
Qichen. China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
and its support would be needed for a U.N.-sanctioned military
strike against Saddam.
   Qian was asked whether his government would support such
military action.
   ``All the armed forces have two roles to play,'' the Chinese
official said. ``One is to fight a warver, the rebound is still well below
the level needed to
significantly boost Americans' living standard, according to most
economists.
   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more
during each hour of work, is vital to increasing the nation's
standard of living without inflation.
   The 1.6 percent third quarter gain in non-farm productivity
reported by the Labor Department was a marked improvement over the
0.3 percent advance in the second quarter, revised from an earlier
estimate, which showed a 1.5 percent gain.
   It was also the biggest advance since productivity shot up at a
2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 1988.
   However, because productivity plunged at a 1.3 percent rate in
the first quarter, it is averaging only a scant 0.2 percent advance
for the first nine months of 1990.
   Still, that is better than the 0.7 percent decline for all of
1989. Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged around 1.4
percent a year - better than the 1.2 percent average in the 1970s,
but far worse than the 3.3 percent annual gain posted in the two
decades following World War II.
   During the July-September period, the number of hours worked
edged down 0.1 percent, the first decline in more than four years.
Economists say this is a sign that employers are preparing for a
recession by not hiring new workers or allowing existing employees
to work more hours.
   Hourly labor costs, a major indication of inflation for
businesses, shot up 4.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with
a 5 percent rise in the second quarter. Hourly labor costs advanced
at a 4.5 percent average for the year so far, compared with 3.2
percent for all of 1989.
   Meanwhile, unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price
inflation, rose 2.8 percent in the third quarter compared with 4.7
percent in the second quarter. For the year so far, unit labor
costs averaged a 4.3 percent gain compared with 3.9 percent in the
1989.
   Total business productivity, including farming, rose 1.9 percent
in the third quarter, bringing the average for the year so far to
up 0.5 percent compared with a decline of 0.5 percent in all of
1989.
   Manufacturing productivity climbed at a 5.6 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, bringing the average for the year so far to
4.5 percent, compared with 2.6 percent last year.

   A gay former soldier celebrated a U.S. Supreme
Court decision to let stand a ruling that will allow him to
re-enlist, but said it was not a significant victory because it
leaves intact the military's ban on homosexuals.
   The high court, without comment, on Monday let stand an appeals
court ruling last year in the case of former Staff Sgt. Perry
Watkins, 42, of Tacoma.
   That ruling did not address the validity of the ban but instead
noted the Army repeatedly had re-enlisted Watkins while knowing he
is homosexual.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Pentagon.
   The Bush administration had sought to overturn the appeals court
ruling.
   Watkins celebrated with sparkling apple juice. A 16-year veteran
with an excellent service record, he said he wants to serve five
more years so he could retire with an Army pension.
   The court's action requires no change in military regulations.
   ``It's not a significant victory,'' Watkins said. ``However,
because I am an admitted homosexual, it is a good ruling and could
certainly have an effect on other cases.''
   Gay rights advocates agreed, athough the appeals court ruling
implied the Army could try to discharge Watkins for any future
homosexual acts.
   ``These days, we'll take a victory any way we can get one,''
said Paul DiDonato of the National Gay Rights Advocates in San
Francisco.
   The court's decision to let the earlier ruling stand ``sends a
broader signal out to the military and the country at large that
gays and lesbians cannot be treated unfairly forever by the
military or any other employer,'' DiDonato said.
   Watkins was inducted in 1968 even though he marked ``yes'' on a
questionnaire that asked whether he had homosexual tendencies.
   He was allowed to re-enlist three times after Army investigators
looked into his homosexuality but was forced to accept an honorable
discharge in 1984. He sued for reinstatement.
   Asked if he anticipated problems after his reinstatement,
Watkins said, ``That goes without saying. The problems that are
going to be there are the problems the system itself will create.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq said today that it would release 77
Japanese nationals in response to the intervention of former
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Japan welcomed the move and said it had made no changes in its
gulf policy in order to win its citizens' freedom.
   The official Iraqi News Agency also said 20 Italians, five
Swedes, two Germans and two Portuguese would be allowed to leave.
   Japanese diplomats in Baghdad said at least 20 of the Japanese
nationals to be released were among those who were held at
strategic installations to serve as ``human shields'' against a
possible attack. The others are businessmen who were in Iraq during
the invasion, according to Japan's Kyodo News Service.
   In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry said Iraq was freeing 69 Japanese
hostages. Japanese diplomats in Baghdad said later that was the
number Nakasone was originally promised would be freed. But they
said Nakasone held a second meeting today with Saddam and won the
release of additional Japanese nationals.
   Japan, which has contributed $4 billion to the anti-Iraq effort,
has said in the past it would not make a separate deal for its
hostages.
   Nakasone's mission was technically private but had the support
of the Japanese government, and the 72-year-old former leader
retains considerable influence in Japanese political affairs.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe welcomed today's Iraqi
move, but said other foreigners should be freed too.
   ``We are delighted to see the release of some Japanese people in
Baghdad. But we cannot permit the Iraqi government to force other
foreign visitors to remain there, and we have continued our demands
that Iraq release these hostages as soon as possible,'' Watanabe
said.
   He said the Japanese hostages' freedom had been achieved without
compromising the government's stand against Iraq.
   Nakasone's visit comes as Japanese lawmakers are considering a
measure to deploy Japanese troops to the Persian Gulf in a
non-combat role. The official Iraqi News Agency had reported over
the weekend that Nakasone had assured Saddam the measure was
unlikely to pass.
   The troop-deployment plan has prompted strong protests in Japan
and by today officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party
had all but given up hopes for its passage. Critics contend the
proposal violates Japan's constitutional ban on sending troops
overseas.
   The Iraqi News Agency said Nakasone met with Saddam today to
``thank him for Iraq's decision to allow a large number of Japanese
nationals - elderly, sick and students - to travel out.''
   Nakasone had carried a list of 90 elderly or ailing Japanese,
which he presented to Saddam during their first meeting on Sunday.
Japanese diplomats in Baghdad said the Iraqi government did not say
why it refused to free all 90.
   They said by late this morning, 40 of those Japanese cleared to
travel had arrived at the Mansour-Melia Hotel in preparation for
departure.
   The Japanese, like most foreigners, had been banned from leaving
as Iraq responded to buildup of the multinational force in Saudi
Arabia that followed Saddam's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
   After his weekend meeting with Saddam, Nakasone said he had
urged an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the freeing of all
hostages.
   The Iraqi leader ``demonstrated serious encouragement to end the
crisis peacefully,'' Nakasone told reporters afterward.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Couple $7.5 Million from Toyota</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: 4Runner is correct.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has ordered Toyota Motor Corp. to pay $7.5
million for an allegedly faulty seat belt that allowed a man to go
through the windshield of a light truck that hit a tree.
   Toyota spokeswoman Mindy Geller said the company was shocked and
planned to appeal.
   The jury awarded $6 million to Cliff Sadlier, who was partially
crippled, and $1.5 million to his wife, Joanne.
   The Sadliers' lawsuit claimed the seat belt failed when the
Toyota 4Runner struck a tree on Feb. 9, 1988. Sadlier, who was
alone in the vehicle, said he was going 25 mph; a Toyota expert
testified he was going 40 mph.
   Sadlier, of suburban Bloomfield Hills, said his head went
through the windshield and his body hit the dashboard. He said he
now must rely on a wheelchair, although he can walk short distances
with crutches and braces.
   Sadlier's attorneys charged the Toyota seat belt lacked a device
to take up slack. Toyota's lawyers said the seat belt met federal
specifications.
   ``We felt the seat belt was defective by design,'' said jury
foreman Robert Gura. ``It doesn't provide the protection the
federal law says it should.''
   Geller said the belt saved Sadlier's life. ``It is ironic that
under these circumstances, such a verdict was awarded to Mr.
Sadlier,'' she said.

<HEAD>Weak Laws, Discrimination Fears Blamed for Lax Enforcement of Alien
Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service
isn't cracking down on California employers who hire illegal aliens
because of political pressure and weak laws, a study concludes.
   Still, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has
compelled the INS to develop a framework to implement stricter laws
if Congress passes them, concludes the study by the Rand Corp. and
the Urban Institute.
   ``In Los Angeles, the law is being implemented appropriately.
It's not being implemented in a very strong, draconian fashion, but
Congress probably didn't intend it to be,'' said Rand Corp.
researcher Elizabeth Rolph, coauthor of the study with Abby Robyn.
   Employers are required to make sure job applicants have legal
documents, such as a valid drivers license or Social Security card.
   But an INS official in Washington said that is circumvented by
the widespread availability of counterfeit documents, such as
drivers licenses and Social Security cards.
   Fraudulent Social Security cards can be purchased on either side
of the border for about $25, said INS spokesman Duke Austin.
   The study said the INS has moved slowly to enforce laws against
hiring of illegal immigrants because many communities depend
heavily on cheap immigrant labor.
   INS officials ``do not want their enforcement posture to alarm
employers, generating a political backlash that might cause
Congress to amend their new authority.''
   Nor does the INS want strict enforcement to trigger employer
discrimination against Hispanics and other immigrant groups, a
trend that could spur Congress to invoke provisions that would
repeal the act, the report says.
   As a result, the 1986 act has done little to reduce the flow of
illegal immigrants into the country, the authors said. The INS
reports that more than one million illegals were caught nationwide
during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, compared to 850,000 in
fiscal 1989.
   The study, which focused on implementation of the act in the Los
Angeles area, was based on interviews with INS officials,
employers, illegal aliens and advocacy groups in the seven Southern
California counties that make up the INS Los Angeles District
between November 1986 and December 1989.

<TEXT>
   A judge ordered a man accused of fatally
stabbing four children and wounding three other family members held
without bond after the man surrendered to authorities.
   Henry Curtis Jackson Jr., 26, surrended Monday to police in his
hometown of West Point, about 90 miles east of Greenwood. He was
returned to Greenwood later Monday.
   Leflore County Justice Court Judge Curtis Underwood ordered
Jackson jailed without bond pending grand jury action in March.
   Jackson was charged with four counts of capital murder, three
counts of aggravated assault and one count of attempted armed
robbery. Capital murder carries a mandatory sentence of death or
life in prison.
   In a statement to police, Jackson admitted the killings, said
LeFlore County Sheriff Ricky Banks.
   Authorities had searched since Thursday for Jackson, who they
believe attacked his sister and six nieces and nephews in his
mother's home.
   Leflore County deputies said they believe Jackson tried to steal
a safe belonging to his half-brother, Eddie Self, that was kept in
the house.
   Forensic pathologist Steve Hayne said the four children, ages 2
to 5, died of stab wounds to the throat.
   Jackson's 23-year-old sister and an 11-year-old niece were in
stable condition Monday with stab wounds at Greenwood-Leflore
Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   A spokesman at University of Mississippi Medical Center in
Jackson said Jackson's 1-year-old niece was paralyzed by the attack
and was in critical but stable condition.

   Two elderly Palestinians were shot and killed
in the occupied West Bank today, hours after a gunman believed to
be of Arab descent assassinated militant Rabbi Meir Kahane in New
York.
   Israeli news reports suggested the killings were linked.
   An Israel radio police reporter said that before news of the
West Bank slayings was aired, an anonymous caller speaking Hebrew
told him ``to check in one of the villages near Nablus, two Arabs
were killed there.''
   The reporter, Moshe Nussbaum, quoted Kahane supporters in
Jerusalem as saying they believed the killings were carried out to
avenge the assassination and that more attacks could take place.
   Arab reports said the killings in the West Bank village of
Lubban Sharqiya near Nablus were carried out by a man in civilian
clothing who fired an Uzi submachine gun and drove a car with
Israeli license plates.
   The army said the deaths were under investigation.
   Several Israeli political leaders tied Kahane's assassination to
his call for expelling Palestinians from the West Bank and occupied
Gaza Strip and throwing Israeli Arab citizens out of the Jewish
state.
   Kahane was slain in a hotel Monday night after addressing a
Zionist group. The gunman, identified by police as El Sayed A.
Noseir, 37, was shot in the chin by a police officer and
hospitalized.
   Israel Army radio said today the assailant once lived in the
occupied territories, but the report could not be confirmed.
Palestinians said the name as given by police was not typical, and
might be Said Nasser or Nasser el-Said.
   Kahane, a 58-year-old former legislator, was widely hated by
mainstream Israelis, but he and his anti-Arab party, Kach, had a
small core of fervent and vocal supporters.
   The Israeli government appealed for calm as police and army
reinforcements spread out in Israel and the occupied territories to
head off revenge attcks.
   ``We are deeply shocked by this murder,'' said Avi Pazner, an
aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. ``Even those, and they are a
great majority in Israel, who do not agree with the political views
of the late Rabbi Kahane deplore and condemn this further act of
Arab terrorism.''
   Israel has been torn by Arab attacks on Jews and revenge
assaults by Israelis since the Oct. 8 riot on the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem, when 20 Palestinians were killed by police. At least
five people have been killed and a dozen wounded in the series of
attacks.
   Faisal Hussein, a Palestine Liberation Organization supporter in
Jerusalem, said today's killings ``raised concerns about the
security of our people.''
   Kahane supporters warned of violence to avenge the
assassination. Officials of his Kach faction dictated a statement
to journalists saying: ``The Lord will avenge his blood.''
   Kach leader David Ben Dor said Kahane's ideas will live on.
``Whoever thinks that today Rabbi Kahane and the Kach movement have
been destroyed has made a great mistake,'' he said.
   Ben Dor spoke beside Kach flags, their yellow fields centered by
a black Jewish star and a clenched fist. About 50 supporters milled
about, some shouting ``Death to the Arabs.''
   Earlier, several Kach supporters threw chairs at reporters to
keep them away from their Jerusalem headquarters. An Israeli
television crewman was beaten by Kach supporters, and one sprayed
tear gas in his face. He was hospitalized, the radio said.
   One woman, who refused to give her name, told reporters: ``You
haven't seen anything yet. One Jew is worth millions of Arabs,
especially when we are talking about Rabbi Kahane.''
   Some Israeli and Arab leaders linked Kahane's killing to his
beliefs.
   Labor Party lawmaker Avraham Burg condemned the assassination,
but said: ``We must not forget that Kahane is the victim of his own
ideology. He sowed hatred and destruction and, in the end, reaped
death.''
   Saeed Kanan, a Palestinian from the West Bank town of Nablus,
quoted the biblical phrase ``He who lives by the sword, dies by the
sword,'' adding: ``Kahane was an advocate of racial discrimination
and apartheid ... He became a victim of his own slogans and
mottos.''
   Residents of the Palestinian village where today's killings
occurred said a man, believed to be from a nearby Jewish
settlement, approached at about 5:45 a.m. in a white car.
   They said he opened fire with his Uzi on Mohammed al-Khatib, 65,
who was riding his donkey to harvest olives in his grove. The
attacker continued down the road and fired again, this time killing
Miriam Khassan, 60, villagers said.
   The deaths raised to 773 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians in the nearly 35-month Palestinian
uprising.
   An additional 294 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs.
Fifty-one Israelis have died in the violence.

   Police running an undercover sting fed
radio stations and a newspaper a false story, saying a lawyer had
been castrated on Halloween during an attack at his home.
   After the story made the front page of the Daily American
Republic and was broadcast across southeast Missouri and northeast
Arkansas, police revealed the assault was a hoax.
   The sting was intended to convince a man who allegedly paid a
police informant $4,000 for the job that the Arkansas lawyer really
had been castrated and his arms and legs broken, police said.
   On Halloween night, officers acted out the assault at the
lawyer's home, and rushed a phony injured man to the hospital. When
reporters heard on police scanners what they thought was a story,
they contacted the sheriff's office in Clay County, Ark.
   Sheriff Darvin Stow then told reporters that city attorney C.W.
Knauts, of Piggott, Ark., was stabbed and rushed to a hospital.
Stow said the attorney had two broken arms and was bleeding from
the groin.
   The target of the sting, Harold Speer of Greenway, Ark., was
charged Thursday in Stoddard County, Mo., with conspiracy, burglary
and assault. He was arrested in Arkansas. Knauts represented
Speer's former wife in a 1985 divorce.
   Investigators said they wanted to keep the plan a secret for a
few days rather than arresting Speer on the spot when he hired the
informant because Speer allegedly told the bogus hit man of other
jobs he wanted done.
   Authorities also said they hoped Speer might provide information
on the slaying of his ex-wife in Phoenix a month after their
divorce.
   Stow said he was sorry if anyone was offended, but it was
necessary.
   ``It's pretty disturbing to me,'' Stan Berry, news editor of the
Daily American Republic, said Monday. ``We're not in the business
of printing fake stories for anybody.''
   The false information was given only by the Clay County Arkansas
Sheriff's Department. No news conference was held and no press
releases were issued by either the Missouri Highway Patrol or
Arkansas State Police, although both were involved in the staged
assault.

<HEAD>Electoral Council Disqualifies 10 of 26 Presidential Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The independent Electoral Council
has barred 10 of the 26 declared candidates from running for
president, including two men who were key members of the Duvalier
regime.
   The council released a statement late Monday saying the 10
failed to comply with filing procedures.
   In anticipation of the council action and possible retaliation
by Duvalier supporters, Haitians jammed stores Monday night to
stock up on supplies. No incidents were reported immediately.
   The 29-year Duvalier dictatorship ended in 1986 when Jean-Claude
Duvalier went into exile, but Haiti has been wracked by turmoil
since then. The current provisional government of Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, appointed in March, is the fifth since 1986.
   The Electoral Council based its decision on technicalities, not
on Article 291 of the 1987 Constitution, which bars criminal
supporters of past dictators from running for office until 1997.
   The candidates - including Duvalierists Claude Raymond and Dr.
Roger Lafontant - were disqualified for failing to conform to
electoral laws, the council said.
   Raymond, former army chief of staff, was removed from the list
because his political party had not been legally registered until
after the Oct. 21 deadline for filing his candidacy, the council
said.
   Lafontant failed to obtain clearance from the government
auditing office on his handling of public funds while serving as
minister of the interior and defense. He also failed to provide a
birth certificate, the council said.
   Council member Jean-Francis Merisier said the decision was based
on election rules. He said application of Article 291 would have
been ambiguous because no candidate has been tried in a court of
law for murder, torture, or misappropriation of public funds.
   Raymond has been accused publicly of having participated in the
massacre that aborted the 1987 presidential elections. He has never
been charged.
   Human rights organizations have accused Lafontant of multiple
human rights violations. An arrest warrant charging him with
conspiring against national security was never served.
   When 12 Duvalierists were barred from running for president in
1987, dozens of people were killed. On election day, armed men in
collusion with the army killed at least 34 voters.
   Also disqualified Monday was conservative candidate Gregoire
Eugene, who as a dissident was exiled by Duvalier. The council said
he failed to pay the required deposit and failed to furnish a bank
account statement.
   The only female candidate, Colette Jacques, was disqualified for
failing to pay the required deposit and for not belonging to a
legally recognized political party.
   The election campaign officially opens Wednesday and will close
Dec. 14, two days before the voting. The new president is to take
office in 1991.
   Among candidates who qualified for the race is the Rev. Bertrand
Aristide, a Duvalier opponent who is believed to have a mass
following among the country's poor, a majority in this Caribbean
nation of 6 million people.
   Other major candidates qualified by the council included Marc
Bazin, a former World Bank official; Silvio Claude, a former
preacher; Louis Dejoie Jr., a businessman; Hubert De Ronceray, a
sociologist; former President Leslie Manigat; and Communist Party
leader Rene Theodore. Two Duvalierist candidates, Clemard Joseph
Charles and Remy Joseph also qualified for the race.

<HEAD>Americans Held as Human Shields Will Be Allowed to Send Messages
Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi officials have agreed to allow Americans
held as human shields at strategic sites to send messages home to
their families, the Red Cross announced today.
   The agreement between the Red Cross and its sister organization,
the Iraqi Red Crescent, eventually will permit family members to
send parcels containing medicine, food, clothing and paperback
books to their loved ones in Iraq.
   The agreement ``extends humanitarian assistance to Americans in
Iraq,'' said Stephen Richards, executive vice president of the
American Red Cross.
   Richards recently returned from Bagdhad where he helped complete
the agreement. He did not see any of the American hostages held at
the sites outside Baghdad.
   The messsage exchange program is expected to get under way in
about 10 days.
   About 106 Americans at the strategic sites will be handed short
forms to write messages. Those will be shipped to the United States
by the Red Cross.
   The family members will be given the messages and allowed to
write responses, which in turn will be delivered to the hostages.
The Iraqi Red Crescent officials will serve as the couriers inside
Iraq.
   Richards said the Red Cross eventually hopes officials will be
allowed to examine the hostages to make sure they are in good
health. Iraqis have told the Americans the hostages are physically
all right, but they miss their families and their psychological
state could be better.

   Here is a breakdown of some of the
foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait as of Tuesday. Most estimates are
based on embassy registrations.
   Some 600 Americans, Britons, Germans and others are being held
in Iraq and Kuwait as ``human shields'' at some 30 strategic
targets. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said he will free some
of them.
   An estimated 2,000 Westerners are hiding in Kuwait.
   According to U.S. State Department figures, more than 900,000 of
the estimated 3 million foreigners who were in Kuwait and Iraq Aug.

leave.
   Some foreigners, mostly women married to Iraqis or Kuwaitis,
have elected to stay. Some governments or independent figures have
negotiated the release of their nationals.
   Saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for U.S.
guarantees he will not be attacked. But some governments have said
they will not negotiate any releases because they believe Saddam is
trying to divide the anti-Iraq coalition.

   Tonight's prime-time election specials on CBS
and NBC won't be sponsored, although ABC's coverage will have
commercials.
   The one-hour NBC special and CBS' two hours of election night
coverage in prime time will be carried as ``sustaining,'' or
unsponsored, representatives of both networks said.
   This means the CBS and NBC broadcasts won't be counted in the
current November ratings ``sweeps,'' one of four key ratings
periods each year that help network affilliates set their local
advertising rates.
   Both NBC and CBS will use the time to promote shows they're
broadcasting as the sweeps period continues this month.
   NBC acted after CBS decided against seeking sponsorship for its
election night program, said an NBC executive who asked not to be
identified. It took that step because of the tight prime-time
ratings race of all three networks this season, the executive said.
   If NBC's coverage was sponsored and included in Nielsen ratings,
low viewing levels the networks expect on election night might pull
down NBC's overall ratings average for this week.
   NBC again is first in prime time ratings this season, but its
margin over second-place CBS is small.
   According to ratings averages for the season through last
Sunday, NBC has a 13.3 ratings average, CBS a 13.0 and ABC a 12.5.
Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.

   Up to 100 cars smashed into each other
in dense fog on a Dutch highway Tuesday, killing at least 10 people
and injuring 27 others, police said.
   Rescue workers were still pulling people out of the wreckage
more than eight hours after the accident on the
Rotterdam-to-Antwerp highway, and the casualty toll could still
rise, Breda police spokesman Roel Holvast said.
   The accident just west of this southwestern city occurred
shortly after 9:30 a.m., when a driver heading south on  collided with
two motorcyclists, Holvast said.
   The crash turned into a pileup because drivers coming fromthe A16
highway
behind were surprised by a dense fog patch on an otherwise clear
day, he said.
   A second pileup occurred on the northbound lane when drivers
there slowed down to see what happpened, Holvast said.
   The road, which links two of Europe's most important ports, was
expected to be closed well into Tuesday evening, Holvast said.

   Nervous politicians put aside opinion polls and campaign
strategies and watched voter turnout across the nation today for
signs of winners and losers in the first midterm election of the
1990s. In North Carolina, where voters were deciding a bitterly
contested Senate contest, officials reported long lines at polling
places.
   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, stood in line for 10
minutes at a polling place at a Houston nursing home. They waved
off reporters' questions and, after voting, went to the airport for
a flight back to Washington.
   Republicans, admitting a low turnout would be bad news for their
candidates in most states, had spent the closing days of the
campaign exhorting their partisans to go to the polls.
   Democrats counted on uneasiness over the economy to induce their
followers to vote.
   The Senate contest between conservative Republican Sen. Jesse
Helms and his black challenger, Harvey Gantt, appeared to generate
a heavy turnout in North Carolina.
   ``Most precincts say they have more people voting than they do
in presidential elections,'' said Mecklenburg County election
supervisor Bill Culp.
   ``When you see long lines like this - more than 300 voters were
here before 8:30 - you know you're going to have a nice day,''
Gantt said. ``It's a good sign for us.''
   Helms voted in Raleigh and described himself as ``always a
little bit anxious'' about the outcome of a campaign.
   ``I've done the best I can and if it's not the best for the
people of North Carolina, then we'll see, but I think it is,''
Helms said.
   In northern Michigan, highway crews had to dig out the snowed-in
clerk of Wellington Township so he could open the polls.
   Snow also was reported in Iowa, but election officials said
early turnout was ``heavier than a normal off-year election.'' In
parts of Nebraska, officials said snow and ice was keeping turnout
down.
   ``We've had trouble even getting poll workers to the polls to
open them up,'' said Nebraska Secretary of State Allen Beerman.
   Embattled Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said the White House was
discriminating against her by withholding word on whether the
president would sign or veto legislation for a study of a proposed
historic reserve in her district.
   Aides to Unsoeld alleged the White House didn't want to allow
her to take credit for enactment of the bill.
   Voters were choosing 36 governors, 34 senators and the entire
435-member U.S. House, as well as more than 6,000 state
legislators.
   Normally obscure legislative races have gotten national
attention from party officials battling for control of the
once-in-a-decade redrawing of political boundary lines to conform
to new census figures.
   The stakes are highest in races for governor in the nation's
fastest-growing states - California, Florida and Texas. When House
seats are redistributed to follow population shifts to the Sun
Belt, those three states will pick up a total of 14.
   In Florida, where Democrats were hopeful that former Sen. Lawton
Chiles would unseat Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, election
officials forecast a high turnout.
   Chiles and Martinez were among the early Florida voters.
   ``You can see the shifting,'' said the underdog Republican
governor. ``You can hear the sound of victory.''
   In California, Republicans were confident Sen. Pete Wilson would
outpoll Democrat Dianne Feinstein in the race to succeed Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian.
   After weeks of barnstorming for GOP candidates from Maine to
Hawaii, Bush concentrated on helping the faltering campaign of
Clayton Williams for governor of Texas. Once far ahead in the
polls, oilman Williams was struggling to outlast Democratic state
Treasurer Ann Richards.
   ``I urge all Texans ... to get out there and vote and do not
take democracy for granted,'' Bush said Monday, campaigning with
Williams at his side.
   But one pre-election poll found 80 percent of Texans thought the
governor's race was too negative.
   ``My biggest complaint was we had no good choice in the
governor's race,'' said Louis Lauritzen, one of about 50 people
waiting to vote at a Grand Prairie, Texas, precinct. ``It was more
a case of voting against someone.''
   A Republican ``ballot security'' program in North Carolina
prompted Democrats to go to a federal judge in New Jersey who had
ruled against such activities in prior elections.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise held Monday that the
Republican National Committee was not involved in the North
Carolina mailings.
   But later in the day, the Justice Department sent lawyers to
North Carolina to try to ensure that black voters aren't
disqualified at the polls based on information gathered by the
state Republican Party.
   Senior Republican Sens. Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Rudy
Boschwitz of Minnesota had reason for uneasiness entering Election
Day, even though closing polls indicated a trend in their
direction.
   Hatfield was challenged by businessman Harry Lonsdale and
Boschwitz was under siege from college professor Paul Wellstone.
   Rep. Pat Saiki was the best GOP hope for ousting a Democratic
senator. She was challenging appointed Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii.
   Pollsters agreed that voters were in a sour mood, unhappy with
the president and Congress alike on their handling of the economy.
   An ABC News poll said 61 percent of the people disapprove of how
Bush is handling the economy and the same percentage also is
unhappy with how Congress has handled the same issue.
   The biggest turnover was expected to come in governors' offices.
No one was predicting much change in the 55-45 Democratic majority
in the Senate or that party's 258-175 margin of control in the
House, which has two vacancies.
   Among the nation's governors, 29 are Democrats and 21
Republicans. All indications were that the Democrats would add one
or two to their total.
   But there also was a strong chance that two independents -
former Republicans - would join the ranks of the governors. In
Alaska, former Gov. Wally Hickel was leading the major party
candidates in the polls, and former Sen. Lowell Weicker was doing
the same in Connecticut.
   Democrats felt good about their chances in Maine, where former
Gov. Joseph Brennan was challenging his Republican successor, John
McKernan. Democrats also were optimistic about Nebraska, where
businessman Ben Nelson was running against Republican Gov. Kay Orr.
   The hottest prospect for a Republican pickup was in Ohio, where
Republican George Voinovich was leading Democrat Anthony Celebrezze
in independent polls.

<HEAD>Former State Official Got Check from Lincoln S&amp;L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former state savings and loan
commissioner received a $50,000 consulting fee from the now-defunct
Lincoln Savings and Loan within a week after he left office, a
newspaper reported today.
   ``There are indications the lucrative deal was being arranged
while he was with the state,'' the San Francisco Chronicle said of
former commissioner Larry Taggart.
   The check was accompanied by a proposed contract that set up
three more quarterly $50,000 payments ending Oct. 1, 1985. The
contract was typed with the year 1984 above the signature blanks,
although Taggart did not leave his state job until 1985.
   Taggart told the Chronicle that two Lincoln representatives
``asked if I could be of any service to them in consulting with
them'' after he left state office.
   ``I told them I really didn't want to discuss anything until I
was out of office,'' he said.
   Of the agreement with the year 1984 on it, Taggart said:
``People type stuff up. I'm not sure what it is.''
   The check was written 27 days after Taggart approved a request
by the now defunct savings and loan involving $900 million in
taxpayer-insured deposits.
   In one of his last major acts as S&amp;L commissioner, Taggart
approved a $900 million transfer to a Lincoln subsidiary - where
Lincoln hoped they would be grandfathered against a forthcoming
rule prohibiting S&amp;Ls from making risky direct investments.
   Taggart gave his approval three days before the deadline for
meeting the grandfathering provision.
   Taggart joined the consulting company TCS Enterprises after he
left office on Jan. 1, 1985. TCS Consulting, a subsidiary, was set
up specifically for Taggart to head.
   On Jan. 18, 1985, Lincoln invested $2.89 million in TCS
Enterprises. The investment bought Lincoln 24.9 percent of TCS,
which Taggart has testified had a net worth of between $200,000 and
$300,000 at the time.
   Thomas Stickel, the founder of the TCS parent company,
speculated that the 1984 date on the contract may have been a
typographical error.
   The agreement was enclosed in a Jan. 4, 1985, letter to Taggart
written by Lincoln corporate counsel Mark Sauter who wrote that a
$50,000 check was also enclosed ``representing Lincoln's first
quarter payment.''
   Lincoln was taken over by federal regulators a day after its
parent company, American Continental Corp., sought bankruptcy court
protection from its creditors. It will cost taxpayers an estimated
$2 billion to bail out the thrift.
   Charles Keating Jr., head of American Continental, is accused in
civil suits of looting Lincoln. Keating also faces criminal charges
in the case.

   Democrats bid Tuesday to fortify their majorities in Congress
and challenged Republican control of four key governorships,
highlights of a midterm election punctuated by the autumn stirrings
of voter discontent.
   With 34 Senate races on the ballot, Democrats took aim at
Republican incumbents Jesse Helms in North Carolina, Mark Hatfield
in Oregon and Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota in hopes of padding their
current 55-45 majority.
   The House of Representatives was securely in Democratic control,
as it has been since the Eisenhower era. All 435 seats were on the
ballot, although most attention clustered around 29 races without
an incumbent, 18 of them currently in Republican hands.
   Among 36 statehouse races, Republican governorships in
California, Texas, Florida and Illinois were at risk, probably the
biggest prizes of the year. The GOP hoped for victories that would
protect their influence in drawing boundaries for House seats that
will shift to the Sun Belt in 1992.
   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo sought a third term in New York in a
possible prelude to a 1992 presidential campaign. Three other
potential challengers to President Bush also seemed headed for
landslide re-election: Democratic Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey;
Al Gore of Tennessee and Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   More than 6,100 legislative races crowded the ballots, and
voters in 43 states and the District of Columbia decided issues
ranging from a proposed tax rollback in Massachusetts to an
environmentalist-sponsored measure known as Big Green in
California.
   Jesse Jackson was on the ballot for the first time as a
non-presidential candidate, seeking to become an unpaid, non-voting
``shadow senator'' to lobby Congress for statehood for the District
of Columbia. The city also chose a new mayor to replace Marion
Barry, who bid for a city council seat in the face of a six-month
jail sentence for a drug offense.
   All in all, the first election of the 1990s came at a time of
extraordinary volatility - with the nation on the verge of
recession and on the edge of war in the Persian Gulf. Other issues
emerged in scattered races - abortion, crime, the savings and loan
crisis and ethics scandals among them.
   The pundits agreed in advance that the electorate was
pessimistic about the future and angry about the way the government
is run. Whether that would imperil incumbents or benefit one party
over another was a different question.
   ``The conventional wisdom is that people are more satisfied with
their own congressman,'' said Frank Newport of the Gallup polling
organization.
   President Bush voted in his home state of Texas after an
energetic yet awkward campaign for GOP candidates. Bush sparked a
season of Republican discontent when he broke his memorable 1988
campaign pledge and embraced an October deficit-reduction plan that
raised tax rates.
   Democrats held a 259-176 majority in the old House. A pickup of
only a few seats in either the House or Senate could vastly
complicate the president's success with the 102nd Congress and make
it more difficult to cast his vetoes without fear of being
overridden.
   Black political leaders expressed hope they could add to the
24-member Congressional Black Caucus. Republicans hoped to elect
their first blacks to the House since 1935: Gary Franks in
Connecticut and former Cincinnati Mayor Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio.
   Among the most closely watched races was the California
governor's contest pitting GOP Sen. Pete Wilson against former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Democrats control the legislature
and the GOP needed the governorship to influence redistricting that
follows the 1990 Census when California is expected to gain seven
House seats.
   The Senate race that drew the most attention was in North
Carolina, where three-term conservative Jesse Helms battled Harvey
Gantt, a black former mayor of Charlotte.
   Boschwitz was challenged by Paul Wellstone, a liberal political
science professor who waged an ingenious ad campaign and took
advantage of the disarray that revolved around a hapless Republican
nominee for governor.
   In Oregon, Hatfield battled businessman Harry Lonsdale in his
bid for a fifth term.
   Republicans hoped to capture a seat in Hawaii where Rep.
Patricia Saiki ran against Sen. Daniel Akaka, appointed after the
death of Spark Matsunaga.
   The GOP counted on three members of the House to move into the
three Senate seats being vacated by retiring Republicans. Robert
Smith was favored in New Hampshire; Hank Brown in Colorado and
Larry Craig in Idaho.
   In all, 16 Democrats and 15 Republicans sought Senate
re-election. Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Pryor of
Arkansas were unopposed. Republicans Thad Cochran of Mississippi
and John Warner of Virginia were also assured of victory.
   Thirty-six states elected governors, and in 13 of them the
incumbent was not on the ballot. Twenty-nine of the nation's
governors are currently Democratic and the party was hoping to add
a few to the list before the night was over.
   Clayton Williams angled to keep the Texas governorship in
Republican hands in a hotly contested race with Democratic state
Treasurer Ann Richards.
   In Florida, former Sen. Lawton Chiles challenged first-term GOP
Gov. Bob Martinez' bid for re-election.
   Other Republicans facing difficult re-election opponents
included Guy Hunt of Alabama and John McKernan Jr. of Maine. The
experts and the polls predicted Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island
would be turned out of office.
   Democrat Rudy Perpich faced a tough fight in a Minnesota race
marked by Republican turmoil. Arne Carlson was on the ballot, but
only because Jon Grunseth dropped out in late October over
allegations of sexual improprieties.
   Eras were ending in Massachusetts, Illinois and Ohio where
governors were electing successors to Michael Dukakis, Jim Thompson
and Richard Celeste. Dukakis had been so discredited that both
candidates - Republican William Weld and Democrat John Silber -
were running as outsiders ready to shake things up.
   In the House, party leaders faced little opposition. Speaker Tom
Foley, D-Wash., was heavily favored, while GOP Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois did not have a Democratic opponent.
   For all the campaign hoopla, voter participation was forecast to
be dismal - as usual. Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for
the Study of the American Electorate, predicted turnout similar to
the last midterm election, in 1986, when 36.4 percent of eligible
voters cast ballots.

   The historic trend in midterm elections is for gains of 28 House
seats and four Senate seats for the party not holding the White
House. That seemed unlikely this time, in part because Democrats
began with such large majorities, and in part because incumbents of
both parties had well-stocked campaign warchests.
   The battle for control of congressional redistricting was
extraordinary as both parties mounted multimillion-dollar efforts
to gain control of state legislative chambers in anticipation of
the reapportionment wars to come.
   ``We are under siege like I have never seen,'' said Pennsylvania
Senate President Robert Jubelirer, a Republican. The Democrats
needed to capture three Republican Senate seats to gain control
over the chamber.
   An estimated 19 House seats are expected to move from
northeastern and industrial midwestern states to California, Texas,
Florida and other Sun Belt states. A party that controls both
houses and the governor's office would have a far easier time
redrawing the district lines to its liking, and maximize its
strength in the House for the next decade.
   Eight women were candidates for governor and eight for Senate.
   At least some candidates had nothing to worry about. For 33
Democratic members of the House and 30 Republicans, Election Day
brought no opponent.
   Pre-election surveys indicated that voters were angry about
their government and concerned about the future, yet unlikely to
toss out incumbents in any number. Much of the discontent erupted
in the fall, well after primary elections had safely returned
incumbents to the ballot.
   A Gallup poll released on election morning said nearly two of
every three people surveyed were dissatisfied with the way things
are going in the nation, many of them because of economic concerns.
   A survey by the New York Times and CBS said 77 percent of those
surveyed believed the government was run by big interests looking
out for themselves.
   The same polls showed that many Americans didn't know whether
their representatives were Democrats or Republicans. But they liked
them, and in most cases the incumbents had far more money than
their challengers - a seeming prescription for re-election.
   Republicans had high hopes earlier in the year that they could
make serious inroads into the Democratic majority of the Senate and
House, and pave the way for possible majority rule later in the
decade.
   Bush made over 100 appearances leading up to Election Day and
raised more than $80 million for Republican candidates, by White
House reckoning.
   But his decision to embrace a tax increase after a prolonged
series of flip-flops sparked a rebellion among many Republican
candidates and seemed to bring to the surface the concern voters
had about the economy in general. It also sent his extremely high
approval ratings plummeting.
   Democrats seized on the tax negotiations with Bush to portray
themselves as the protectors of the middle class and the
Republicans as defenders of the rich, and Republican analysts
watched glumly in mid-October as the polls charted a decline in GOP
support.
   Some Republicans criticized the president's decision to his
face; still others stayed away from rallies he held for them;
others decided they didn't want his help.
   ``A major mistake,'' said one Republican senator of the tax
agreement. He was Dan Coats, appointed to his seat to succeed Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   Bush did his best to minimize the damage.
   ``Don't listen to that tired, liberal, divide class warfare
rhetoric about soaking the rich,'' he said in Texas the day before
the election. Hold onto your wallets - they're after you, every
single one of you,'' he said of the Democrats.
   Toward the end, Bush changed the focus of his speeches to the
Persian Gulf, and analysts said it arrested the Republican decline
in the polls, and in the president's approval ratings, as well.
   ``I want to see a peaceful resolution to this crisis,'' Bush
said the day before the election. ``But let me be very, very clear.
We will stop short of making one single concession, because
aggression that goes rewarded today will be much worse tomorrow.''
   Whatever the outcome, there was already talk about the impact of
this year on 1992. Many Republicans said Bush had damaged himself,
and some held out the possibility that he would face a largely
symbolic, conservative challenge for the GOP presidential
nomination in two years.
   Democrats hoped that the emergence of the ``tax fairness'' issue
would give them a wedge for the 1992 campaign.
   Even taking the economy into account, this was an election
without an overriding theme.
   Abortion played a role in a scattering of races, and a few
lawmakers were challenged for their ties to the savings and loan
industry. Bush's veto of a year-end civil rights bill came up in
the California governor's race - Wilson voted to sustain it - and
in a few Senate contests as well.
   But some of the issues that provoked the loudest debate in
Congress had long since faded by the time the fall arrived,
including controversies over flag burning, the ``peace dividend''
and many environmental concerns.
   With Democrats joining the president's Persian Gulf policy, the
deployment of more than 200,000 troops half a world away never
became an issue, either.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today ordered the release of 106
foreigners, including some who were held as ``human shields'' at
key installations, Iraq's official news agency said.
   The report said those to be freed are 77 Japanese, 20 Italians,
five Swedes, two Germans and two Portuguese.
   The Iraqi News Agency said the move to free more hostages was in
response to appeals made by various visiting delegations. It had
already said the Japanese nationals were being freed in response to
an appeal by former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt was also in the
region in an effort to win the freedom of captive foreigners.
Today's news of the planned releases came one day after European
countries denounced individual attempts to gain the freedom of
hostages.
   Also in Baghdad today was PLO chief Yasser Arafat. He told
reporters that prospects for a peace settlement are better than
what they were a month ago, and urged the United States to show
flexibility.
   Arafat met with both Brandt and Nakasone.
   In addition to announcing the new hostage releases, Iraqi
officials have reportedly agreed to allow Americans held as human
shields at strategic sites to send messages home to their families.
   The Red Cross said under an agreement with its sister
organization, the Iraqi Red Crescent, family members will also be
allowed to send parcels containing medicine, food, clothing and
paperback books to the captives.
   The agreement was announced in Washington by Stephen Richards,
executive vice president of the American Red Cross, who recently
returned from Baghdad.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III traveled to
Egypt for the next leg of his weeklong trip to test the idea of
military action against Iraq. A key Soviet envoy, meanwhile,
reportedly told Western diplomats that his country does not rule
out the use of force against Iraq.
   On Monday, Baker and Saudi King Fahd agreed that the United
States will not attack Iraq without Saudi approval, but that
American troops would be under U.S. command once they go to battle.
   Under the accord, the Saudis will share command of U.S. troops
as long as the Americans are defending Saudi Arabia, a Bush
administration official said on condition of anonymity.
   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister pointedly reminded Iraq today
that the United Nations has not ruled out the use of military force
to liberate Kuwait.
   ``We would like a peaceful settlement, but that option is in the
hands of the Iraqis,'' said the minister, Prince Saud.
   Baker also met in Cairo with China's foreign minister, Qian
Qichen. China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
and its supprt would be needed for a U.N.-sanctioned military
strike against Saddam.
   Qian was asked whether his government would support such
military action.
   ``All the armed forces have two roles to play,'' the Chinese
official said. ``One is to fight a war, and the other is to seek
peace.''
   A poll released Monday, meanwhile, said 56 percent of Americans
would support an attack on Iraq if U.S. hostages are mistreated.
Fifty-one percent said they would back an attack if Iraq refuses to
quit Kuwait.
   Nearly seven in 10 of those responding to the ABC News survey
said they expected the United States to go to war.
   In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry said 19 of the Japanese captives
being freed were among those transferred from Kuwait to Iraq to
serve as ``human shields'' against a feared attack by U.S.-led
multinational forces in the Persian Gulf region. Another 50 are
businessmen who were in Iraq at the time of the invasion, according
to Japan's Kyodo News Service.
   The Foreign Ministry put the number of Japanese to be freed at
69, while the Iraqi report said 77 would be released. Japanese
diplomats said Nakasone had won the freedom of the extra hostages
in a second meeting with Saddam today.
   Japan, which has contributed $4 billion to the anti-Iraq effort,
has said it would not make a separate deal for its hostages.
Japanese lawmakers are considering a measure to send troops to the
gulf, but in non-combat roles.
   On Monday, the European Community pledged to remain united
against Saddam by refusing to negotiate individually for the
release of hostages.
   Italy, president of the 12-member community, convened an
emergency foreign ministers' meeting at the request of Belgium and
the Netherlands to discuss potential cracks in the EC's Iraq policy
stemming from the separate hostage missions.
   In other private visits, a delegation of Irish legislators left
Baghdad Monday after a similar mission, and former New Zealand
Prime Minister David Lange was reported en route to the gulf to
arrange a meeting with Saddam.
   In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher today
suggested Arab states friendly with Iraq be asked to mediate the
release of hostages.
   Brandt's mission has the backing of the German government
despite the European Community's stand.
   Meanwhile, the British Broadcasting Corp. on Monday quoted
Yevgeny Primakov, an envoy to Mikhail Gorbachev, as saying a
translator erred last week in interpreting Gorbachev as saying a
military option was ``unacceptable.''
   Primakov has traveled twice to Baghdad for meetings with Saddam
in an effort to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.
   The BBC said Primakov told ambassadors in Moscow that the Soviet
Union continues to insist on the full implementation of the two
U.N. Security Council resolutions, which call for a trade embargo
on Iraq and the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi
forces from Kuwait.

<HEAD>New Homeowners Find Honey of a Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allen and Annette Clausen never thought about
another interpretation of the phrase ``home sweet home'' until they
found a 300-pound beehive in a wall of their new house oozing with
honey.
   ``It's a nightmare, this honey,'' Clausen said Monday, surveying
the two-story home that had been vacant for two years before he
bought it from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.
   Honey was dripping down the walls and spilling onto floors.
Hundreds of bees killed by fumigators last month were under the
kitchen stove and behind fireplace tile. Some live ones have
returned.
   ``This has been the worst thing of its kind that we have run up
against,'' said Bruce Manning, vice president of Land Ho, the
company that managed the property for the Veterans Department.
   The Clausens bought the three-bedroom house last month for
$78,500. They had planned to put in new carpets, tile and
baseboards before moving in.
   Now, since no one realized the extent of the problem, those
plans are on hold.
   Thousands of bees built the 6-foot, 300-pound hive between the
back of the fireplace and an outside wall. Another colony built a
hive in a kitchen wall and has spread between the kitchen ceiling
and a bedroom floor. Fifty pounds of honeycomb were found above a
ceiling panel.
   A pest control company killed the bees before the Clausens
completed the purchase, Manning said. But no one realized the
extent of the hives or that other bees might move in.
   Mrs. Clausen complained that Veterans Affairs, Land Ho and the
pest control company seem to be avoiding responsibility for the
problem.
   Manning disputed that, saying they had done everything possible
to help the couple.
   ``They're going to be happy when it gets done,'' he said.

   Justice Department lawyers monitored voting
today in North Carolina because of postcards the Republican Party
sent regarding eligiblity to vote, but officials reported no
problems at polls.
   ``We do not have anyone who has gone to the polling place with
the card and been denied the right to vote,'' said Everette Ward,
executive director of the North Carolina Democratic Party.
   Ward said party lawyers were on duty to explain that voters who
had moved from their old precinct still could vote.
   The Justice Department is threatening legal action if North
Carolina election officials try to disqualify voters with
information that state Republicans compiled from a postcard
mailing.
   An investigation in the closing days of the heated Senate race
between Republican incumbent Jesse Helms and Democratic challenger
Harvey Gantt found that more than 100,000 postcards bearing
misleading and inaccurate information were sent to voters in 29
counties.
   The investigation began Friday after Democrats charged that the
North Carolina Republican Party targeted heavily black precincts
with mailings of 150,000 postcards intended to intimidate voters
from going to the polls.
   A heavy turnout of black voters is important to Gantt, the black
former mayor of Charlotte, in his effort to unseat three-term
Helms. The race has been close down to the wire.
   The postcards told voters that they could not cast ballots if
they had moved in the last 30 days. They also warned voters it was
a federal crime to give false residency information to election
officials.
   ``The card says if you have moved you can't vote,'' Ward said.
``That's not true. As late as this morning we have people who have
received the cards who are calling in and want to discuss that with
us.
   ``What we're doing is trying to eliminate the confusion and
encourage people that they can vote.''
   Alex Brock, state director of elections, said no problems from
the GOP postcards had been reported to his office. Brock said the
turnout at the state's 2,416 precincts was brisk and he predicted a
55 percent turnout.
   ``We've had no problems caused by those postcards,'' Brock said.
   ``In our judgment the statement on the card was misleading, if
not totally inaccurate,'' John R. Dunne, assistant attorney general
for civil rights, said Monday night.
   Dunne said the Justice Department had secured a written pledge
from the state GOP that it wouldn't compile lists of voters to
challenge at the polls from postcards that had been returned
because the addressee had moved.
   While there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the
department will review the evidence to determine if a civil suit
should be brought, he said.
   Jack Hawke, the North Carolina GOP chairman, defended the
postcards, saying ``the only people who received a mailing from us
are those that are improperly registered.''
   The lawyers were assigned to travel to the 29 counties ``to send
out the message that these challenges should not be honored'' and,
if necessary, seek court injunctions, Dunne said.

<TEXT>
   Richard Clark Lindsay, a retired Air
Force lieutenant general who commanded NATO air forces in southern
Europe, has died. He was 85.
   Lindsay died of heart failure Saturday at a Glendale hospital,
said his son, Richard B. Lindsay, of Fremont.
   Born in Minneapolis, Lindsay graduated from the University of
Minnesota and enlisted as a flying cadet with the Army Air Corps in
1928.
   He became assistant director of training at Brooks Field in
Texas in 1941. Later that year, he joined the War Department
general staff.
   Lindsay became chief of the combined Joint Staff Division of the
Army Air Forces Headquarters in 1944. In 1945, he served as
assistant chief of staff of plans for the U.S. Army Strategic Air
Forces at Guam.
   Lindsay served in Tokyo for 10 years, then was appointed
commander of NATO air forces in southern Europe in 1957. He held
the position until he retired from the service in 1960.
   He worked as a consultant to defense contractors until 1969.
   In addition to his son, survivors include a daughter, Raylyn
Terrell of Alexandria, Va.; nine grandchildren and eight
great-grandchildren.
   Services will be held Sunday at the Presidio in San Francisco
and at Arlington National Cemetery on Nov. 25.

   ``(It's) the Jewish establishment that destroys the Jew,

   ``Twenty-five years after the Voting Rights Act was passed,
black Americans have become a major force in the political life of
this nation,'' said Eddie N. Williams, president of the center.
   Three veteran black Democratic congressmen, Augustus Hawkins of
California, George Crockett of Michigan and Walter Fauntroy, the
District of Columbia's non-voting delegate, all were retiring and
were likely to be replaced by black Democratic women.
   They are: California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters; Detroit City
Councilwoman Barbara-Rose Collins and lawyer Eleanor Holmes Norton
in Washington.
   New Orleans was certain to elect a black Democrat to succeed
retiring Rep. Lindy Boggs. Tuesday's runoff under Louisiana's
unusual election system pits two black Democrats against one
another: attorney Marc Morial against state Sen. William Jefferson.
   The joint center counts 51 blacks in races for House seats or
statewide offices, including Democrat Theo Mitchell, a state
senator trying to oust incumbent Republican Gov. Carroll A.
Campbell Jr.
   Six black Republicans were on the ballot in House races in
Kentucky, Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois and Mississippi. Two open
seat races in Ohio and Connecticut appeared to offer the best
chance of producing the first black Republican member of the House
since 1935: former Cincinnati Mayor J. Kenneth Blackwell and
alderman Gary Franks in Waterbury, Conn.
   Republican Gov. Kay Orr in Nebraska was in a stiff re-election
fight. The nation's two other incumbent women governors, Madeline
Kunin in Vermont and Rose Mofford in Arizona, chose not to run for
re-election.
   Like Pat Saiki, Republican congresswomen Lynn Martin of Illinois
and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island relinquished their
congressional seats to run for the Senate. But Martin was trailing
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon in pre-election polls and Schneider was
a longshot against Sen. Claiborne Pell.
   Women were vying for 66 House seats and eight Senate seats. In
two House races, both candidates were women.
   There are currently 28 women in the House and two senators.
There are no blacks in the Senate, but the House has 24 blacks, 13
Hispanics and one American Indian.
   Overall, there are 85 women seeking federal or statewide office,
according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics.

   Massachusetts voters grappled Tuesday with a $2.6
billion tax-cutting initiative that opponents feared would
devastate the state's frail finances.
   Question 3, backed by Citizens For Limited Taxation, would
shrink state taxes and fees to 1988 levels. It would slash $1.3
billion from the state's $13.4 billion budget in the second half of
the current fiscal year, and cut $2.6 billion in fiscal 1992, which
begins next July.
   Recent increases in the state income, sales and gas tax would
all be rescinded.
   ---
   Opponents argued the cuts would hamper state services, including
day care, elderly programs, and police and firefighter training.
College campuses could be shut down, and weaker school districts
dependent on state funding could face bankruptcy, officials warned.
   Proponents, angry over four major tax increases in a little more
than a year to try to pay state bills, said budget cuts were in
order.
   ``This is a chance to stop the tax increase that is coming if
Question 3 does not pass,'' said Barbara Anderson, head of CLT.
   The financially ailing state already has the lowest bond rating
in the country. Bond rating agencies warned passage of Question 3
could drop the state's rating from its current level of Baa to junk
bond status.
   Acknowledging the voter discontent that spawned the initiative,
opponents had campaigned on the theme: ``I'm mad but I'm not
crazy.''

   Workers today mopped up thousands of gallons

River, authorities said.
   Estimates from Amoco indicate 21,000 gallons spilled from a
break in the line, said Scott Holste, a spokesman for the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources. The spill covers six or seven
miles, he said.
   ``It may not be known for several more days how much was
spilled. There are indications that that estimate is low,'' Holste
said.
   The oil was contained and Amoco was using absorbing equipment to
clean up the oil, he said.
   It was not immediately known when the spill occurred. The DNR
was notified about the spill by Amoco after early this morning,
Holste said.
   Damage to fish and other wildlife was unknown, officials said.
   The Chariton River runs from the Missouri-Iowa border and
empties into the Missouri River.

   A high-stakes race for governor between
Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein topped a
cumbersome California ballot Tuesday, along with a sweeping
environmental initiative known as ``Big Green.''
   With Republican Gov. George Deukmejian retiring after two terms,
the GOP sought desperately to hold onto the office. Otherwise,
Democrats who control the Legislature would have a free hand
drawing new congressional boundaries to their party's liking.
   The long list of 28 ballot issues included two conflicting term
limit initiatives and two competing liquor tax increases.
   Democrat Kathleen Brown, the sister of former Gov. Jerry Brown
and daughter of former Gov. Pat Brown, tried to launch her own
statewide political career by challenging the incumbent Republican
state treasurer, Tom Hayes.
   Incumbents were heavily favored in most of California's 45
congressional races, but there were several tight races:
   -Actor Ralph Waite, television's ``Papa John Walton,'' waged an
unexpectedly strong campaign as a Democrat in a heavily Republican
desert district surrounding Palm Springs against GOP incumbent Al
McCandless.
   -GOP incumbent Charles ``Chip'' Pashayan, crippled politically
by links to indicted former Lincoln Savings chief Charles Keating,
was in a close fight against Democratic challenger Calvin Dooley in
a San Joaquin Valley race.
   -San Diego Democrat Jim Bates, formally rebuked by the House
Ethics Committee for sexual harrassment of women employees on his
congressional staff, was challenged by former Navy flyer,
Republican Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham.
   -Rep. George Brown, a perpetual target of Republicans, faced
another strong challenge from Republican Bob Hammock, a San
Bernardino County Supervisor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The current makeup of the congressional delegation is 27
Democrats and 18 Republicans.
   A final round of independent pre-election polls in the
governor's race showed Wilson, the state's junior U.S. senator,
leading by anywhere from 1 to 8 percentage points over Feinstein,
the former mayor of San Francisco.
   ---
   Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and Wilson, the
state's junior U.S. senator, waged a see-saw campaign in which they
spent a combined total of nearly $40 million.
   Much of the campaign focused on comparisons of Wilson's 11-year
tenure as mayor of San Diego before his 1982 election to the Senate
and Feinstein's nine years as mayor of San Francisco.
   Both are political moderates, both pro-choice and both pro-death
penalty.
   Below the surface was the issue of reapportionment in 1992, when
California's congressional delegation expands from the current 45
to 52 or more seats.
   Since Democrats have had firm control of both houses of the
Legislature for the past 20 years, Republicans believed their only
hope to prevent a Democratic gerrymander of those districts is the
threat of a veto from a GOP governor.
   Leaders of both parties said the difference between a Democratic
and Republican governor could be 10 to 12 congresssional seats.
   Proposition 128, the ``Big Green'' initiative, was a sweeping
plan to phase out cancer-causing pesticides, ban chemicals that
harm the ozone, and reduce emissions of gases that contribute to
global warming.
   It would also preserve old-growth redwood stands, restrict
offshore oil drilling and create a new elective office of
environmental czar.
   It was supported by every major environmental group in the state
and vigorously opposed by water, timber, agricultural and
manufacturing groups.
   Proposition 140 would limit the governor and most other elected
state officials to eight years in office, limit state senators to
eight years and Assembly members to six years. Its rival,
Proposition 131, would limit legislators to 12 years in office.
   The two liquor tax proposals were put on the ballot by competing
interests. Proposition 134, a nickel-a-drink plan, was a
$750-million-a-year tax hike supported by emergency room
physicians, and many law enforcement and alcohol counseling groups,
among others. Proposition 126 was a penny-a-drink alternative
sponsored by the liquor industry.

   Herbert Berghof, an acting teacher whose
students included Geraldine Page, Fritz Weaver, Liza Minnelli, Al
Pacino and Robert DeNiro, has died at age 81.
   Berghof, who also was a director and actor, died Monday at his
Manhattan home of a heart ailment, a family spokesman said.
   For more than 50 years, Berghof helped to hone the stage and
screen skills of performers. Among his students were Miss Page,
Weaver, Miss Minnelli, Pacino, DeNiro, Anne Bancroft, Donna
McKechnie and Matthew Broderick.
   He showcased many works by new playwrights at his Greenwich
Village school, the Herbert Berghof Studio.
   Berghof, who fled his native Austria after the country merged
with Nazi Germany in 1938, opened an acting school in the Chelsea
section of Manhattan in 1945.
   In 1947, he became a charter member of the Actors Studio, but
came to disagree with his colleagues there who preferred the Method
Technique when he shifted his own focus to an emphasis on actions
rather than thoughts and reactions.
   Among the plays he directed was the American premiere of Samuel
Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot,'' in 1956.
   He also directed New York productions of the first black version
of ``Godot'' in 1957, Jean Cocteau's ``Infernal Machine'' (1958),
F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``This Side of Paradise'' (1962), Pavel
Kohout's ``Poor Murderer'' (1976), and Peter Hacks' ``Charlotte,''
starring his wife, Uta Hagen, in 1980.
   Some of Berghof's Broadway roles were in ``King Lear'' (1940),
``Little Women'' (1944), ``Ghosts'' and Hedda Gabler'' (1948).
   In addition to Hagen, his wife of nearly 40 years, Berghof is
survived by a step-daughter, Letitia Ferrer of Manhattan, and a
granddaughter.

   Democrat Sharon Pratt Dixon battled Maurice
Turner on Tuesday as the District of Columbia picked a new mayor to
replace scandal-scarred Marion Barry.
   Jesse Jackson sought election as a ``shadow senator'' to lobby
Congress for statehood.
   Barry, who faces a six-month jail term for cocaine possession,
sought election to an at-large city council seat. He has served
three terms as mayor.
   Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton was favored in her race against
Harry Singleton for the non-voting House seat despite revelations
that she failed to file city income tax returns for a seven-year
period beginning in 1983.
   Voters also decided whether to restore a sweeping overnight
shelter provision gutted by the city council earlier this year
because of cost concerns.
   A record number of city residents was registered to vote. Board
of Elections spokeswoman Leona Agouridis forecast a high voter
turnout from the 308,000 residents eligible to go to the polls.
   Whatever the outcome, the election was certain to produce new
leadership for a city that spent much of last year buffeted by the
details of Barry's arrest on drug charges, his sensational trial
and the imposition of a six-month jail sentence.
   Dixon, a 46-year-old former utility company executive, scored a
surprise primary win in September after pledging to eliminate waste
and fraud in the district government.
   Turner, the city's former police chief, zeroed in on Dixon's
lack of political experience and criticized her plan to drop 2,000
workers from the city payroll.
   The Democratic nominee hit Turner for his conversion to the GOP
last year, frequently calling him ``a born-again Republican.''

   Democrat Lawton Chiles, who said he was ``burned
out'' two years ago when he retired from the Senate, tried Tuesday
for a political comeback against Republican Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Chiles, 60, said he came out of retirement to lead a revolt
against big-money politics. State Democrats hoped he would help
them rally against a GOP tide.
   Martinez, 55, was trying to cap his own comeback after a shaky
first term. Only the second Republican governor in Florida since
Reconstruction, Martinez headed a GOP ticket aiming to boost its
11-8 congressional delegation lead and take control of the state
Senate. It would be the first time Republicans have been the
majority party in a Deep South legislative chamber in modern
history.
   Floridians also voted on whether to retain their first black
chief Supreme Court justice, Leander Shaw, who was targeted by
anti-abortionists, and on whether the crime-beset state should make
mandatory a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
   ---
   With reapportionment looming in 1992, Florida drew heavy
attention from both national parties. The state is expected to gain
at least three congressional seats, and Republicans said they could
reverse traditional Democratic gerrymandering if they could control
the governorship and at least one legislative chamber.
   President Bush campaigned for Martinez three times and his son,
Jeb, was Martinez's campaign chairman.
   Martinez started in April against Chiles as much as 30 points
behind in some polls but headed to the finish in what polls
indicated was a dead heat.
   Spending $10.6 million, the grandson of Spanish immigrants kept
up a torrid campaign schedule and bombarded Floridians with
feel-good ads that portrayed him as a beach-strolling family man
who did best at protecting the environment and executing criminals.
One tough-on-crime ad featured a picture of serial killer Ted
Bundy, who was executed on Martinez' order last year.
   He tried to portray himself as the populist outsider fighting
``that Tallahassee gang'' and called Chiles a liberal Washington
insider.
   Chiles voluntarily limited individual contributions to $100 each
and spent $5.2 million. He said his refusal to rely on heavy
contributors would let him govern without obligations to special
interests.
   His low-key, low-budget pace worried supporters such as Steve
Pajcic, the 1986 Democratic nominee who said Chiles' money strategy
was ``dumb, naive and idealistic.'' And Chiles said because he
personally was anti-abortion although pro-choice politically, his
conscience wouldn't allow him to hit Martinez hard on the
governor's unpopular efforts to further restrict abortion in the
state.
   Chiles stunned Democrats in December 1987 by announcing he
wouldn't seek a fourth term. He had become the Senate Budget
Committee chairman, but said he was ``burned out'' by Washington's
failure to fight the budget deficit.
   When he abruptly entered the gubernatorial race, it was
disclosed Chiles was on the anti-depressant drug Prozac. Chiles,
who underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery in 1985, halted taking
the drug but resumed its use midway through his campaign.

   Watergate burglar and former FBI agent
G. Gordon Liddy says his transformation from convict to novelist is
not surprising because prison gave him what he needed to write.
   ``The thing you need to write is time - I had lots of it,''
Liddy, 60, said Monday during a visit to Alaska to plug his newest
book, ``The Monkey Handlers.''
   The novel, published by St. Martin's Press, focuses on the
efforts of a former Navy Seal to stop medical experiments on
animals at a chemical plant on the Hudson River.
   It is Liddy's third book and second novel.
   Liddy served time in nine prisons after being convicted of
participating in the 1972 burglary of the Democratic Party's

   BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) - A 14-year-old boy aiming his shotgun at a
pheasant accidentally shot Sen. Conrad Burns. The Montana
Republican's injuries were minor and he stopped for breakfast on
his way to the hospital.
   Eleven pellets struck Burns during Sunday's hunting accident. He
was struck in the forehead, left hand and shoulder.
   Burns, who was elected to his first term in 1988, was treated in
the emergency room at a Billings hospital, said Yellowstone County
Deputy Sheriff Bill Michaelis.
   Michaelis said the teen-ager was in a creek bottom and the
senator was on a hillside about 20 yards away. The boy fired when a
pheasant flew by.
   ``I don't know if he got it, but he got Senator Burns,''
Michaelis said.
   The shots knocked the senator down, Michaelis said.
   At a news conference Monday, Burns showed few scars from his
accident. He said the young hunter was a friend of his son.

   Former senator and presidential
candidate George McGovern and his partners in a Stratford hotel
have filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition to avoid eviction.
   McGovern and his partners in the Stratford Inn filed the
petition Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Bridgeport.
   ``It was done to buy enough time to reorganize,'' said Richard
D. Zeisler, an attorney for the partnership.
   Stratford Inn Associates Limited Partnership, whose president is
McGovern, was delinquent in paying the hotel's landlord, Goldman D.
Lorenzo.
   Lorenzo had threatened to terminate the lease McGovern signed
when he purchased the hotel in October 1988 for $1 million, Zeisler
said.
   Court records show the partnership listed $986,000 in
liabilities, including $43,000 in taxes owed to the town of
Stratford.
   The petition also lists $986,000 in assets.
   Earlier this year, the state filed three liens against the
Stratford Inn totaling more than $60,000 for non-payment of sales
tax and room occupancy tax.
   McGovern, a former senator from South Dakota, was defeated by
President Nixon in the 1972 presidential race.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - American bass James Morris has been
described as a bigger than life cowboy because of his love for wide
open spaces and his imposing presence on and off the stage.
   He has also been described as demanding and aloof.
   But after a Monday night season opener for the Opera Company of
Philadelphia, Morris was in good spirits - partly because his wife
performed in the same opera.
   Morris sang Count Almavivia ,the philanderer in Mozart's ``The
Marriage of Figaro.'' His wife, mezzo soprano Susan Quittmeyer,
sang the role of Cherubino, a page and an unwitting foil for
Figaro.
   Quittmeyer said the casting didn't happen by chance.
   ``These are never coincidences,'' she said.
   Morris agreed, saying scheduling was a problem in their personal
lives.
   ``It's great when we get a chance to be in the same part of the
country and even greater to be together in a production,'' he said.

love the West, too.''

   Democrat Neil Hartigan and Republican Jim Edgar
battled Tuesday in Illinois' first wide-open governor's race in
more than a decade - a race that reversed the usual political
wisdom on taxes.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon was challenged in a bid for
re-election by Republican Rep. Lynn Martin, whose anti-tax message
and late call for limiting the terms of Washington lawmakers had
not stopped her slide in the polls.
   Hartigan, the attorney general, tried to appeal to voters weary
of taxes by saying he would not ask lawmakers to extend a special
income tax for education.
   Edgar, the secretary of state, said pinching pocketbooks was
better than shortchanging schools.
   A late October survey done for the Chicago Tribune had Edgar in
front, 45 percent to 34 percent, with 20 percent undecided, but a
Chicago Sun-Times poll in the same period found the race a dead
heat.
   There also was a wild card: a slate of black candidates in Cook
County who ran under the banner of the Harold Washington Party -
named after Chicago's late black mayor - and urged blacks to oppose
Hartigan.
   The latest Senate survey showed Simon ahead, 62 percent to 28
percent, with 10 percent undecided.
   Most members of the state's congressional delegation appeared
headed for re-election, but there were two competitive races in the
Chicago area.
   In the 11th District, Republican Walter Dudycz tried to oust
Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Annunzio by portraying him as a friend
of the savings-and-loan industry.
   The National Republican Congressional Committee put Annunzio on
its list of endangered Democrats.
   He is the No. 2 Democrat on the House Banking Committee and
chairman of a subcommittee that has some S&amp;L oversight. Annunzio's
relatives have ties to the industry, and S&amp;Ls executives have
helped finance his re-election bid.
   In the 4th District, freshman U.S. Rep. George Sangmeister, who
knocked off an incumbent by only 1,000 votes in 1988, faced
Republican Manny Hoffman.
   Before the election, Illinois Democrats had a 14-8 edge in the
U.S. House.

   After 14 years in office, Republican Gov. James R. Thompson did
not seek re-election, leaving the field open.
   Hartigan, 52, staked his campaign primarily on one issue:
opposition to extending an income tax that is earmarked for schools
and local governments and expires in June 1991.
   Edgar, 44, said school districts would be a financial mess if
the tax revenue stopped flowing.
   In the Senate race, Martin told voters that Simon was too
liberal for the state. The five-term congresswoman from suburban
Rockford struck a time-for-change theme and declared that she would
not vote for higher taxes, although she had supported several
increases during her House career.
   Simon had been considered vulnerable going into the race. But he
outspent Martin roughly 2-to-1 by late in the campaign, and Martin
conceded she knew her race was a long shot.

   Voters chose between two political newcomers for
governor Tuesday, both promising to rebuild Massachusetts from the
ashes of what only two years ago Gov. Michael S. Dukakis ballyhooed
as a miracle economy.
   In the race between moderate Republican William Weld, a former
federal prosecutor, and fiery John Silber, on leave as president of
Boston University, the name of Dukakis was mentioned often and
unfavorably.
   Weld and Republicans, who have not won the governor's race since
1970, also got behind Question Three on the ballot, a tax rollback
initiative that would return $1.2 billion to taxpayers this fiscal
year. Silber opposed the rollback as an economic disaster for a
state that can hardly pay its bills now.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor
under Dukakis, was bidding for a second term. He faced James
Rappaport, a mutimillionaire businessman in a surprisingly tight
race.
   Such challenges were otherwise restricted to the state and local
level. Of the state's 11 congressmen, four were not opposed in the
general election, and the other seven, including lone Republican
incumbent Silvio Conte, were favored to win re-election.
   Although Democratic Rep. Barney Frank was reprimanded by the
House earlier this year for his activities with a male prostitute,
Republican candidate John Soto attracted little money in his bid to
oust him.
   ---
   Silber, who emerged as the underdog winner of the Sept. 18
Democratic primary, was no die-hard Democrat. He acknowleded he
voted for President Bush over Dukakis in 1988, and he didn't
hesitate to blame Dukakis for the state's fiscal mess, including
annual deficits and the lowest bond rating of any state in the
nation.
   ``The incompetence of the Dukakis administration is appalling to
me,'' Silber said in the final televised debate of the campaign.
   Still, Silber stressed traditional Democratic positions, such as
economic pump-priming to help ease the state's economic recession.
He opposed Question 3 and pointed to Weld's opposition to an
assault weapons ban as a sign of the GOP nominee's basic
conservatism.
   Silber's general election campaign was calmer in tone than his
primary election, in which a series of statements on women,
immigrants, welfare mothers were dubbed ``Silber shockers'' by the
media.
   But the statements never seemed to have a serious impact on
Silber, who frequently complained he was quoted out of context.
   Silber, 64, has his roots in Texas, but campaigned on his
20-year record at BU and as a political outsider who would end what
he says are the tax and spend policies of Dukakis.
   Weld, 45, a former U.S. attorney for Massachusetts and former
head of the Justice Department's criminal division, argued that
underneath the rhetoric, Silber was a traditional Democrat tied to
other members of the power structure.
   The Kerry-Rappaport race was negative from the start.
   Rappaport attempted to tie Kerry to Dukakis and also criticized
the incumbent for his interest in foreign relations issues.
   Kerry struck back, claiming Rappaport's family had made millions
through federal housing money and agricultural subsidies that
Rappaport opposed in his Senate campaign.

   Twelve members of a university lacrosse team
were charged with misdemeanors in the death of a teammate who
overdosed on alcohol during an alleged initiation, school officials
said.
   The 12 were arrested Monday and charged by the McDonough County
state's attorney's office with hazing and unlawful delivery of
alcohol to a minor.
   Nicholas Haben, 18, of Oswego, was found dead Oct. 19 in a
Western Illinois University dormitory room. Officials said he was
forced to drink a large quantity of alcohol. Authorities refused to
say how much alcohol was involved.
   Haben died after he and other first-year players were led to a
wooded area, swatted, and encouraged to consume ``rookie juice,'' a
concoction that included beer, schnapps, coffee, tuna, eggs and hot
dogs, authorities said.
   Brian Donchez, who is among those charged, said the students did
nothing wrong.
   ``We didn't haze and that's all there is to it,'' said Donchez,
21, of Chicago.
   The 12 students were released after each posted $100 on $1,000
bonds.

<HEAD>Court Says Families Of Killed Seamen Not Eligible For Monetary
Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
families of American seamen killed on the job may not be awarded
monetary damages for lost future earnings or ``loss of society.''
   The 8-0 decision, yielding the first signed opinion of the
court's 1990-91 term, said general maritime law allows
wrongful-death lawsuits in such cases. But it added that any
damages recovered cannot include those for loss of society or for
lost future earnings.
   Loss of society is defined as a broad range of mutual benefits
family members receive from each other, including love, affection,
care, attention, companionship, comfort and protection.
   The ruling was a defeat for the mother of a young seaman
murdered while his ship was docked in Vancouver, Wash., six years
ago.
   ``We sail in occupied waters. Maritime tort law is now dominated
by federal statute, and we are not free to expand remedies at will
simply because it might work to the benefit of seamen and those
dependent upon them,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote.
   Justice David H. Souter, who joined the court after the case was
argued last month, did not participate in the decision.
   The ruling leaves families of seamen free to sue allegedly
negligent shipowners and shipping companies under a 1920 federal
law, the Jones Act, but that law places specific limits on such
suits.
   Ludwick Torregano, a 24-year-old galley assistant, was killed
aboard the Archon on July 18, 1984. Clifford Melrose, the ship's
chief chef, stabbed Torregano at least 62 times, and later was
convicted of second-degree murder.
   Torregano's mother, Mercedel Miles, later sued the ship's owners
and operators in federal court in New Orleans, contending that
their negligence in hiring an unfit crewman caused her son's death.
   Ms. Miles was awarded $140,000 for the pain and suffering
Torregano experienced prior to his death and $7,800 for the loss of
her son's support. Those awards were made under the Jones Act.
   But the jury refused to award additional damages, under general
maritime law, for the loss of Torregano's future income or for the
loss of society by both Ms. Miles and the seaman's father, Joseph
Torregano.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the damages award
last year, and Tuesday's decision in turn upheld the appeals court
ruling.

   In Minnesota's wildest governor's race ever,
Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich struggled to win a fourth term Tuesday
against Arne Carlson, a Republican who was put on the ballot just
last week.
   Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz also was locked in a tight
contest, partly because of the GOP's gubernatorial turmoil. He
faced Democratic college professor Paul Wellstone, who waged a
campaign with puckish humor.
   Election officials predicted that results could be delayed
several hours because a switch in GOP gubernatorial candidates
forced the printing of supplemental ballots, which were to be
counted by hand.
   Carlson finished second in the GOP primary. But he became his
party's gubernatorial candidate a week ago to replace Jon Grunseth,
who withdrew amid allegations he swam nude with teen-age girls and
cheated on his wives.
   An independent poll taken Oct. 19-21, while Grunseth was still
in the race and Carlson was being urged to mount a write-in
campaign, showed Carlson leading Perpich 51 percent to 41 percent
in a hypothetical race.
   Five Minnesota Democratic congressmen and two Republican House
members were seeking re-election. Republicans also hoped to retain
the 3rd District seat, which Bill Frenzel is vacating after 20
years.
   Republican Rep. Arlan Stangeland, under fire for billing
personal telephone calls to his congressional expenses, faced
frequent challenger Collin Peterson in Minnesota's 7th District in
the northwestern and central parts of the state.
   Also on the ballot was a proposal that would send 40 percent of
net state lottery proceeds to a trust fund designated to protect
natural resources and wildlife.
   ---
   Republican turmoil in the gubernatorial race far overshadowed
the problems that plagued Perpich at the beginning of the year,
when he was dubbed ``Governor Goofy'' for his actions in a series
of disputes with the news media.
   Perpich, 62, was seeking to become the first Minnesota governor
to serve four terms.
   Carlson, 56, has been state auditor for 12 years. He had
launched a general election write-in campaign a week before
Grunseth withdrew.
   Three weeks before the election, Grunseth was accused of
encouraging four girls aged 13 to 16 to join him for a nude swim at
a 1981 pool party and of trying to touch one girl's breast.
   Grunseth denied those allegations. Then late last month a
newspaper described a woman's story of having an affair with
Grunseth during both of his marriages. Grunseth said the affair
ended before he married for the second time, but he dropped out of
the race later that day.
   ``Certainly there have been other election seasons in Minnesota
fraught with conflict, acrimony and dispute,'' said Hyman Berman, a
history professor at the University of Minnesota. ``But we've never
had a candidate who was found to have his zipper unzipped and we've
never had a major party candidate drop out voluntarily within a
week of the election.''
   Wellstone, 47, a Carleton College political science professor,
campaigned with a series of humorous television ads - one of which
showed him ``looking for Rudy'' in a takeoff of the documentary
film ``Roger and Me.''
   But Wellstone was on the defensive in the last week of the
campaign after Boschwitz, 59, told voters that Wellstone's national
health care plan would result in the shutdown of the Mayo Clinic
and that Wellstone's spending proposals would require a doubling of
taxes.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new 2nd graf with Pentagon raising total of U.S.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps said today it was ordering to
active duty about 630 reservists from units in eight states for
combat roles in the Persian Gulf. It is the first such use of
American combat reserves in the crisis.
   Also today the Pentagon announced that more than 230,000 U.S.
forces are deployed in the gulf area, and that deployments are
continuing. The total is 20,000 more than the Pentagon's previous
official estimate, issued last month.
   The Marine Corps decision, while not significantly increasing
U.S. combat capability in the gulf, marks an important departure
for the Pentagon. It opens the way to possible use of major Army
reserve combat units in Operation Desert Shield and signals a
growing U.S. military and political commitment to evicting Iraq
from Kuwait.
   The more than 34,000 reserves called to active duty by all the
military services over the past 10 weeks have been used only in
non-combat roles.
   Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, said today that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney is considering giving the Army the authority
to call up major combat reserve units, but that no decision has
been made.
   The approximately 630 Marine combat troops being put on active
duty are among 824 Marine reserves called up for a variety of
combat and support duties. The callup order issued by Gen. Al Gray,
commandant of the Marine Corps, brings to 998 the total number of
Marine reserves put on active duty for Desert Shield.
   Among all the military services, 35,173 reserves have been
called to active duty for the gulf crisis, including the Marines'
latest call-up, Williams said.
   The 630 Marine combat reserves are being assigned initially to
the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Camp Pendleton, Calif., to
form a specially tailored group known as an air-ground task force.
   It is expected that the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade will be
sent to the gulf as replacements for one of several Marine task
forces already there as part of Desert Shield, although Pentagon
spokesman Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner said no decision had been made on
an eventual deployment of the 5th MEB to the gulf.
   The combat reserves are being called from the following units:
   -4th Light Anti-air Defense Battalion at Pasadena, Calif.,
totaling 55 men.
   -4th Light Armored Vehicle Battalion at Camp Pendleton, 34 men.
   -4th Tank Battalion, Company A and a detachment from
Headquarters and Service Company, at Miramar Naval Air Station,
Calif., totaling 120 men.
   -An anti-tank platoon from the 23rd Marines at Brousard, La.,
totaling 75 men.
   -4th Combat Engineer Battalion, an engineer support company and
a detachment from headquarters and service company, at Baltimore,
Md., totaling 24 men.
   -4th Amphibious Assault Battalion at Gulfport, Miss., and 4th
Assault Amphibian Battalion at Norfolk, Va., totaling 189 men.
   -4th Force Reconnaissance Company at Reno, Nev., 34 men.
   -2nd Battalion, 25th Marines at Bronx, N.Y., 53 men.
   -4th Combat Engineer Battalion, Charleston, W.Va., 49 men.
   Use of reserves for combat roles is politically sensitive
because it can be viewed as putting the country on a wartime
footing. No shots have been fired in the confrontation with Iraq,
but President Bush has not ruled out the use of force to oust Iraq
from occupied Kuwait.
   The Pentagon has been under pressure from some congressional
leaders to use combat reserves. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had
resisted using them, saying the 180-day maximum period of
activation for reserves was too short to make good use of them.
   That concern was erased earlier this month when Congress,
shortly before adjourning, doubled the limit on active duty service
for combat reserves to 360 days.

   Three-term Republican Sen. Jesse Helms and
Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt squared off Tuesday in an epic
clash between the conservative Old South and the progressive New
South.
   Gantt, 47, an architect who served two terms as the first black
mayor of Charlotte, campaigned as an unabashed liberal. He
advocated the idea that ``government has a role'' in solving the
nation's education, environmental and health care problems.
   Helms, 69, a leading spokesman for the American right, argued
that government is too large and intrusive and needs to be cut
back. He sounded his familiar themes, attacking affirmative action
programs as unfair to whites and decrying pornography and
homosexuality as signs of declining moral values.
   Voter turnout was running heavy in both urban and rural areas of
the state. Long lines were reported in both predominantly white and
black precincts as the polls opened.
   Opinion polls released last week showed a close race. One poll
gave Helms a lead of 4 percentage points; another gave Gantt the
same lead. Both had margins of error of 3.5 percentage points.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Helms, limited to eight days of full-time campaigning by the
late adjournment of Congress, injected the issue of race into the
campaign in the final week.
   Helms accused Gantt of running a ``secret campaign'' aimed at
getting black voters to the polls. He played a radio ad for Gantt
in which a black couple discusses the need to vote.
   Helms' television ads also accused Gantt of using his minority
status in 1985 to acquire a television station license that later
was sold to a white-owned company. The Federal Communications
Commission approved that sale, which Gantt called ``a private
business deal that did not involve one dime of government money.''
   Helms also criticized the 1990 Civil Rights Act, calling it the
``quota bill.'' The measure failed when the Senate fell one vote
short of overriding a veto by President Bush. Bush said he vetoed
the bill because it would force businesses to develop quotas for
minority hiring.
   ``If you want quotas to dominate and dictate whether you get a
job or get a promotion, you vote for Mr. Gantt,'' Helms said.
   Gantt said Helms' claims of a secret campaign to get blacks to
the polls were ``stupid.''
   ``Don't let Jesse Helms divert you into thinking that Harvey
Gantt is doing something sinister or secret over the airwaves,''
Gantt said. ``How can you run a secret campaign in the black
community over radio stations? That is stupid.''
   Gantt also ridiculed the senator's claim to represent North
Carolina values.
   ``With his lies?'' Gantt asked campaign crowds. ``With his
distortions? With his lack of courage? Of course not.''
   Gantt campaigned on Helms' votes against education and
environmental bills. He said Helms was more interested in foreign
affairs than state concerns.
   Helms argued that his votes against those measures were based on
his concerns that federal spending was excessive.

   Sen. Mark Hatfield bid for a fifth term
Tuesday against a surprisingly strong challenge from Democrat Harry
Lonsdale, a free-spending businessman who campaigned as a political
outsider.
   Lonsdale, who also criticized Hatfield for not doing enough to
reduce cutting of old growth forests, had led in some late October
polls. But the incumbent appeared to aave regained momentum in the
final week.
   In the race for governor, Democrat Barbara Roberts held a slight
edge in polls over Republican Dave Frohnmayer. Independent
anti-abortion candidate Al Mobley appeared to be stealing support
from Frohnmayer and was favored by about 14 percent of voters in a
late survey.
   Incumbent Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat, did not seek
re-election.
   Republican Denny Smith was in trouble in his bid for a sixth
term in the U.S. House from the state's 5th District. He faced
Democrat Mike Kopetski, who came within 707 votes of upsetting
Smith two years ago.
   Democrats were likely to retain control of the state Senate,
where they hold a 19-11 advantage. Control of the state House, now
32-28 in favor of Democrats, could go either way.
   Voters also faced 11 statewide ballot issues. Polls showed
voters closely divided on a measure that would shut down the
state's only nuclear power plant, the Trojan plant in northwestern
Oregon.
   Another measure would reduce property taxes by an average of
nearly 50 percent over five years, threatening the funding of
schools and local governments. Late polls showed the measure had a
slight edge
   Still another proposition would give $2,500 income-tax credits
to parents for sending children to private schools. Polls indicated
that measure was falling out of voters' favor.
   A proposition to ban abortions except in reported cases of rape
or incest or to save the mother's life appeared headed for defeat.
But a measure requiring doctors to notify a parent before
performing an abortion on a minor had voters split.
   ---
   The Senate race was one of the most bitter in Oregon in years.
Both Hatfield and Lonsdale used television advertisements to make
increasingly negative allegations.
   Lonsdale, 58, financed his campaign primarily out of his own
pocket and charged that Hatfield was protecting timber companies at
the expense of the environment.
   Hatfield was slow to respond. He initially ignored Lonsdale and
invested little in television advertising, relying instead on
traditional handshaking and personal appearances. After polls
showed Lonsdale closing to within striking distance, Hatfield
counterattacked with a blitz of television commercials.
   Hatfield, 67, is completing his fourth term in the Senate and is
the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
   Roberts, 53, in the middle of a second term as secretary of
state, portrayed herself as a leader who takes decisive stands on
tough issues. She charged that Frohnmayer was indecisive.
   Frohnmayer, 50, halfway through a third term as state attorney
general, claimed spending programs advocated by Roberts would
require tax increases.

   A thief took a cooler containing nine

and may not realize the danger, police say.
   Whoever took the blood ``should be alarmed because what they
have is potentially fatal,'' especially if a vial breaks in

   Several items were taken from the car, including the cooler
containing the unmarked vials. The researcher was identified as a
40-year-old woman who works for the California Heterosexual Partner

   The woman had the blood in her car because she does some of her

night while the woman was visiting friend in east Oakland, he
said.
   Besides the cooler, the car stereo, jewelry and personal papers
were taken.

don't train,'' said Sgt. Maj. J. R. Kendall of Bravo Co., 1st
Battalion, 505th Paratroop Regiment.
   ``We keep from getting bored by training hard,'' said Kendall,
carrying a shotgun during a trench warfare exercise. ``If the
decision is made to go offensive, these paratroopers are ready.''
   Elements of the 82nd Airborne were the first American ground
forces to arrive in Saudi Arabia after President Bush drew ``a line
in the sand'' Aug. 7, five days after Iraq's lightning conquest of
Kuwait. About 220,000 U.S. troops are now in the region and more
may be sent.
   On Tuesday, paratroopers swarmed a practice range, firing
rifles, machine guns, grenades and anti-tank missiles during a
number of drills.
   ``The soldiers here have the same edge they had before. As they
train hard, these soldiers will stay hardened,'' said battalion
commander Lt. Col. John Schmader of Clarion, Pa.
   But others say the months of waiting have taken a toll. Troops
are hunkered down in the desert, with the relentless sun and flies,
waiting for U.N. sanctions to work while military strategists plot
war scenarios in their air conditioned corridors of power.
   In the bunkers, aboard the ships, even in the hospitals, there
are signs of restlessness.
   ``We feel a lot of tension, like a tight spring,'' said 1st Sgt.
George Spear, 40, of Coleman, Ala., and the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force. ``By our nature, it's difficult for a Marine
to sit still.''
   Marine Cpl. Carlin Walters, 21, of Vidor, Texas, sat on his bunk
swatting flies earlier this week.
   ``We're not fighting Iraqis. We might as well throw away our
M-16s and grab our flyswatters,'' Walters said. ``The boredom gets
pretty strenuous. It's getting worse and worse. It'd be better just
to go ahead and get it over with. It's going to happen anyway.''
   Other soldiers are eager to get on with their mission.
   ``Let's do it ... and go home. All it's been is a waiting
game,'' said Marine Pvt. Stephen Mayfiled of Seattle.
   Commanders have worked to keep their forces ready by training
hard and varying their routines.
   ``Skills atrophy if you don't work at them,'' said Brig. Gen.
Mike Myatt, commanding general of the 30,000 Marines on the ground
in Saudi Arabia.
   The biggest fear is that troops may be getting sloppy by sitting
around. So far, 43 military peopl have died in accidental deaths
during the deployment.
   ``People are getting impatient,'' said Staff Sgt. Warren T.
Williams, 29, of New York City. ``They came over here to do
something and now they have to wait. Everybody's dropping their
defenses.''
   In an accident last week, Navy petty officer Ronald Fox took a
.50-caliber round through his left shoulder while on a supply run
when a Marine sentry improperly cleared his weapon.
   ``We got to get it done over here so we can all go home,'' Fox
said from the intensive care unit of the hospital ship USNS
Comfort. His age and address were not divulged.
   Even surgeons are wary of the lull.
   ``I tell my crew we're like a finely tuned race car, a Maserati,
that's been put in the garage and allowed to collect dust,'' said
Capt. Roger Pentzien, 44, of Vienna, Va., the Comfort's chief
medical officer. ``They aren't going to lose their medical skills,
but that's the fear.''
   ``We just want to go in and clean house and go home,'' said
Airman Mike Beam, 22, of Houston, serving with the Air Force 401st
Supply Squadron. ``Just make Iraq a big parking lot.''

<HEAD>Three Bodies To Be Exhumed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The bodies of three elderly patients
will be exhumed as part of a homicide investigation into deaths at
Pinellas County nursing homes, authorities said.
   Two others already have been exhumed for autopsies, including
one in Rhode Island.
   Medical Examiner Joan Wood is to perform an autopsy this week in
Williamsport, Pa., on a sixth body - an 81-year-old woman who died
in a Pinellas Park nursing home three years ago.
   Hazel DeRemer died at Sunshine Village Nursing Home during or
shortly after the shift of licensed practical nurse Brian Kevin
Rosenfeld on July 17, 1987, said Sheriff's Sgt. Greg Tita.
Rosenfeld worked at Sunshine Village from February through
September 1987.
   Wood will oversee the three exhumations in Florida when she
returns.
   Authorities said the four died at county nursing homes while
under the care of Rosenfeld. During the past five years, Rosenfeld
has worked in at least 10 nursing homes in the county.
   Rosenfeld, 32, was charged with murder in August after two
nurse's aides at Rosedale Manor nursing home said he injected a
suspicious fluid into the feeding tube of comatose 80-year-old
Muriel Watts. An autopsy revealed she died from a massive dose of a
tranquilizer.
   Rosenfeld is being held without bail at the Pinellas County
Jail.
   The medical examiner's office decided to seek the exhumation of
DeRemer after officials noticed parallels to the Watts case, Tita
said.
   Wood and investigators from the sheriff's and state attorney's
offices also went to Pawtucket, R.I., on Sept. 6 and exhumed the
body of Alphonse Silva. Toxicology tests showed no signs of foul
play, sheriff's officials said.
   An affidavit seeking that autopsy said investigators were
looking into numerous suspicious deaths at Rosedale Manor.
   Rosenfeld was employed there from April until late July. Sixteen
residents, including Silva, 76, died during that time. Six of the
deaths occurred during or shortly after Rosenfeld's shift,
authorities said. The bodies of four of the six were cremated,
leaving Watts and Silva.
   Investigators have subpoenaed Rosenfeld's work records, names of
patients under his care and their medical records from 10 Pinellas
County nursing homes where Rosenfeld worked since January 1985.
   Rosenfeld was released from or left the 10 jobs following
allegations of misconduct or violation of nursing home policies,
police have said.

   In a move toward peace on the eve of the
anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, Boris N. Yeltsin said
Tuesday he and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have agreed to discuss their
differences.
   Yeltsin, the Russian president, declined to say who proposed the
meeting scheduled for Sunday, but it was the Soviet president who
approached Yeltsin to shake his hand after a holiday ceremony in
the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.
   ``We just agreed with Gorbachev to meet on the 11th
one-on-one,'' Yeltsin said. ``There will be very many issues and it
will be an important meeting,'' he said, declining to elaborate.
   The meeting will be the first between the rival politicians
since their attempt at reconciliation over economic reform broke
down in late summer. The rift put Yeltsin's Russian Federation, the
Soviet Union's largest republic, on a collision course with the
central government.
   Russia adopted its own plan for converting to a free market
economy, conflicting with a more cautious plan endorsed by
Gorbachev and adopted by the national legislature.
   Gorbachev appeared to have been motivated to suggest the
peacemaking session by a speech at the Revolution Day gala in the
congress hall. Leonid Y. Bliznov, a Soviet legislator, noted
Gorbachev and Yeltsin had tried to work together but ``now, very
little is left of this alliance.''
   ``It's incomprehensible who or what stands in the way of the two
leaders, who know the people's needs and whom the people recognize.
Both of them must realize that future opposition makes them both
less popular,'' Bliznov told the audience of more than 3,000
Communist Party officials and politicians.
   As applause erupted in the huge, wood-paneled hall, Gorbachev
turned to look at Yeltsin, seated six people to his left on a long
podium in front of a huge portrait of Soviet founder Vladimir
Lenin. Yeltsin did not turn to make eye contact.
   Yeltsin told reporters later that he would make a speech in a
few weeks explaining his differences with Gorbachev.
   The Kremlin ceremony amounted to a pep rally for Communists, who
are expected to face criticism from dozens of groups on Wednesday.
   A traditional military parade, followed by a speech by
Gorbachev, is scheduled for Red Square to celebrate the revolution
that brought Bolsheviks to power in 1917. Yeltsin was invited to
stand atop the Lenin Mausoleum along with Gorbachev and other
officials.
   At least two anti-Communist groups plan marches in Moscow. Some
demonstrators urge a ``day of mourning'' be held for victims of
seven decades of totalitarian rule. Some have vowed to march
through Red Square demanding the resignation of Gorbachev and the
Soviet parliament.
   Yeltsin, who has quit the Communist Party, said Soviets should
use the holiday as a time for reflection: ``People must again look
back and pay tribute to what the revolution did and analyze what
the mistakes were during that period.''
   ``The biggest mistake was turning things over to a totalitarian
regime,'' he said.

Playmate</HEAD>

   A defense attorney today challenged
the memory of a woman who says her father killed her childhood
playmate more than 20 years ago.
   During the second day of cross-examination, defense attorney
Douglas Horngrad questioned Eileen Franklin-Lipsker about the
chronology of her actions as she allegedly resurrected the
long-repressed memory.
   George Franklin Sr., 51, is on trial for the murder of
8-year-old Susan Nason after his daughter told police last November
that she'd remembered the 1969 attack. Franklin has pleaded
innocent to the charges.
   Franklin-Lipsker testified Monday that she first recalled the
murder in January 1989 and told a therapist about it in June.
   But Horngrad asked her why she took so long to discuss the
memory with a professional.
   ``Is five months recent?'' Horngrad asked Franklin-Lipsker.
   ``I would say that if I had a 5-month-old memory of a
20-year-old murder, that's very recent,'' she replied.
   Franklin-Lipsker at times seemed impatient under Horngrad's
questioning. On Monday, she appeared near tears as she testified
about the slaying.
   She said she watched as her father raped the girl in the back of
his van, then killed her. The 29-year-old woman testified the girl
was crouched down, crying, when her father approached with a rock.
   ``Her hands flew up to her head. ... The next thing I heard was
two blows. It sounded terrible. It sounded like a crack and a
splat,'' she said.
   Moments later, she said, she walked over to her friend's body.
   ``I saw blood,'' she said. ``I saw hair that was no longer
attached.''
   Franklin was charged with murder after his daughter went to
police last year. She said she had repressed her memories of the
slaying for two decades until they came flooding back when she
looked at her own daughter.
   Franklin, a former San Mateo firefighter, could be sentenced to
life in prison if convicted.
   The defense maintains that there is no evidence linking him to
the murder and that his daughter could have based her allegations
on old news reports of the slaying.
   Franklin-Lipsker appeared tense and sometimes distraught as she
also told of suffering years of sexual abuse and beatings at the
hands of her father.
   She denied defense claims that she told her story to collect
thousands of dollars from book and movie deals. She said she signed
a $50,000 book contract and a $10,000 movie deal only to stop the
offers from pouring in.
   She used $5,000 to pay legal fees and donated $55,000 to
children's charities, ``Children of the Night'' and the
``Children's Home Society,'' she said.

<HEAD>Thatcher Urges Action to Fight Global Warming</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All nations must face up to the threat of a
climate disaster and take steps against global warming, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said Tuesday.
   Thatcher, in a keynote speech to a United Nations meeting of
ministers on the issue, said much more research is needed but a
``clear case for precautionary action'' exists now.
   ``It is a race against time ... to save our planet,'' French
Prime Minister Michel Rocard told the officials from some 120
countries, including more than 80 ministers.
   In an appeal aimed in good part at the United States and the
Soviet Union, Mrs. Thatcher demanded all countries begin work on
binding commitments to rein in rising pollution by ``greenhouse
gases.'' The limits would be for a planned global treaty on climate
change to be ready in 1992.
   But there were increasing signs Tuesday that ministers, contrary
to European Community hopes, will fail to agree on targets or
deadlines so as not to endanger Wednesday's conference-ending
declaration.
   ``Not to come to a result would be a very bad signal,'' German
environment minister Klaus Toepfer told reporters. ``We have to do
our best to come to a minimum compromise.''
   Environmental groups said the draft declaration looks ``more
like a non-declaration as all the crucial points on carbon dioxide
reduction targets, dates and the urgent call for immediate action
have been removed.''
   Carbon dioxide pollution, much of it from burning fossil fuels,
is seen as the leading cause of global warming. Methane and
chlorofluorocarbons are other heat-trapping ``greenhouse gases.''
   Americans and Soviets are the biggest contributors of man-made
carbon dioxide emissions.
   Washington opposes immediate targets against carbon dioxide
pollution, saying more scientific data is needed to justify the
enormous costs involved in changing ways of life. The Soviet Union,
Saudi Arabia and some other countries also have reservations.
   China sounded a Third World note of reluctance. ``Measures to
protect the global climate should not hinder the economic
development of developing countries,'' delegate Song Jian told the
two-day meeting.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who holds a chemistry degree, warned climate
change could occur more quickly than current computer models
suggest.
   ``Should this happen it would be doubly disastrous were we to
shirk the challenge now.''
   Many steps would be ``sensible in any event'' - improving energy
efficiency, developing alternative sources of supply,
reforestation, rethinking industrial processes and tackling the
waste problem, she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Rocard followed the lead of scientists from
some 100 countries, who met last week in the conference's first
part. The experts made plain that global warming undoubtedly exists
and appealed to politicians for immediate measures.
   Scientists say global temperatures could rise at their fastest
rate in 10,000 years next century if nothing is done. Among the
feared upheavals are rising sea levels that would displace coastal
dwellers, desertification and vast changes affecting wildlife.
   Bikenibeu Paeniu, prime minister of Tuvalu, told delegates they
may hold the key to the ``continued existence'' of his South
Pacific coral atoll group and other islands.
   ``We in the Pacific, the Carribbean and elsewhere have done the
least to create these hazards but now stand the most to lose,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Sacramento River's Chinook Salmon To Be Protected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service said
Tuesday that the winter run of chinook salmon in the Sacramento
River is a threatened species. The ruling blocks any take of the
fish by sport or commercial fishermen.
   The service's final determination means the winter run of
chinook salmon will be added to a list of threatened species under
the Endangered Species Act.
   The American Fisheries Society asked the government to protect
the salmon in 1985, pointing to evidence that run sizes for winter
chinook in the northern California river had fallen to about 2,000
per year, down fromabout 84,000 in the late 1960s.
   The fisheries service decided in 1987 not to list the species as
threatened, but to depend on restoration and conservation efforts
planned by state and federal authorities.
   But in 1989, the run size for the year was estimated at 533
fish, and an emergency rule declared the species threatened on Aug.
4, 1989, the agency said in a statement.
   Early data for 1990 show even fewer winter chinook returning, so
the ruling is being made final, ``based on the sizes of the
returning runs of chinook in 1989 and 1990, the lack of information
indicating success made by restoration efforts, and the unique and
fragile nature of this stock.''
   The fisheries service said its scientists would be monitoring
water levels in the Sacramento River to make sure that distribution
of water for development or irrigation would not increase the
threat to the chinook.

   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen signaled on
Tuesday his government's willingness to go along with a U.N.
resolution to authorize the use of force to liberate Kuwait from
Iraqi invaders, U.S. officials said.
   Even though Qian did not explicitly approve sending troops into
action - ``we`ll still have to wait and see,'' he said - the stance
the Chinese minister took on the U.N. resolution in a meeting with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III enhances President Bush's
campaign against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   U.S. officials, commenting on condition of anonymity, said
Qian's comments were an indication that at the very least the
Beijing government would not veto such a resolution.
   China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has
the power to use its veto to block approval of the resolution Bush
wants authorizing the use of troops against Iraq.
   ``All armed forces have two roles to play,'' Qian told reporters
at the outset of his two-hour meeting with Baker at Cairo airport.
``One is to fight a war. The other is to seek peace.''
   Qian thereby underscored that China was not necessarily
approving going to war to rescue Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
   Baker, in his only public comment of a long day, which included
a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said he agreed
with Qian that armies can be used for peaceful or military
purposes.
   China has supported all 10 resolutions approved by the Security
Council, but was considered hesitant to take an additional step
authorizing use of what Bush and Baker call ``the military
option.''
   Qian stressed his government still preferred a peaceful solution
of the Persian Gulf crisis, which Baker on Monday said had entered
a new phase.
   ``I think all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations are
intended to increase the pressure on Iraq so as to achieve a
peaceful settlement,'' the foreign minister said.
   Baker on Thursday in Moscow will solicit the views of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has declared in the past that
it is unacceptable to have a military solution to the gulf crisis.
   The outcome of Baker's meeting with Mubarak, meanwhile, was not
all that clear.
   The Egyptian president abruptly canceled a news conference in
Cairo and Baker did not give the 20 reporters traveling with him an
account of the meeting as they flew to Ankara for talks Wednesday
with Turkish officials.
   Instead, a memo was read to the reporters by a U.S. official in
which these points were made:
   - Mubarak agreed with Baker that ``a partial solution'' to
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait was unacceptable and that the U.N.
resolutions should be implemented fully.
   - Mubarak told Baker that Egypt ``is very, very solid'' in
supporting U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.
   - They discussed ways of giving U.S. logistical support to the
approximately 14,000 Egyptian troops deployed in Saudi Arabia
alongside more than 100,000 U.S. troops.
   U.S. officials aboard Baker's U.S. Air Force jet refused to say
whether U.S. B-52 bombers would be based in Egypt.
   They insisted, meanwhile, that Baker had not discussed a
timetable with Mubarak for an attack.
   Still, as Baker completed the fourth day of an eight-day trip
the possibility of war still hung in the air.
   Baker will dispatch John Kelly, the assistant secretary of state
for the Near East, to Damascus on Wednesday to brief Syrian
leaders.
   Kelly will then go on to Brussels to talk to officials of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community.

   A gunman believed to be of Arab descent
assassinated Jewish extremist Meir Kahane at a Manhattan hotel,
ending a fiery career that took the radical rabbi from Brooklyn
street corners to the front line of the Arab-Jewish conflict in the
Middle East.
   Kahane, 58, was shot to death Monday night in midtown Manhattan
after addressing a Zionist group. The gunman, El Sayed A. Noseir,
34, was shot in the chin by a postal police officer as he fled and
was hospitalized, police said.
   Noseir has repaired air conditioners for the city's Department
of General Services since 1988, said Albert Scardino, a spokesman
for Mayor David Dinkins. Other background on Noseir was not
immediately available.
   Israel Army radio reported early today that Noseir once lived in
the occupied territories.
   Police said only that the gunman was believed to be of Middle
Eastern origin but that his exact nationality was not known. He
carried several pieces of ID with different addresses. A city
official said he lived in Brooklyn.
   Authorities said they were investigating a motive.
   ``Everything indicates he was acting alone,'' said Chief of
Detectives Joseph Borrelli.
   Reverberations of the assassination were felt in Israel, where
Kahane supporters threatened vengeance. Two elderly Palestinians
were shot and killed in the occupied West Bank today. Israeli news
reports suggested the killings were linked.
   An Israel radio police reporter, Moshe Nussbaum, quoted Kahane
supporters in Jerusalem as saying they believed the killings were
carried out to avenge the assassination and that more attacks could
take place.
   Borrelli said Noseir stood up and opened fire twice with a
.357-caliber handgun as Kahane was taking questions in a
second-floor conference room. The rabbi, who stood about four feet
from the gunman, was shot in the neck.
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner's
Office, said a post mortem indicated ``a single bullet entered the
left side of the neck and exited through the right cheek.''
   The bullet was fired at close range, she said. Borakove said the
family did not want an autopsy performed because of religious
reasons.
   Noseir and an officer and a bystander also wounded in the attack
were reported in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, where
Kahane was pronounced dead.
   Police stood guard early today over Noseir, who was under
sedation and could not immediately be interrogated, officials said.
Hospital spokesman Rob Frazier said it was unlikely he would be
able to talk for at least two days.
   Kahane, as founder of the Jewish Defense League, urged Jews in
the United States to arm themselves against anti-Semitism. Later,
as a far right-wing member of Israel's Parliament, he was one of
the Jewish state's fiercest anti-Arab politicians.
   ``Revenge is a very Jewish concept,'' he said of his call for
the expulsion of the 1.7 million Palestinians from the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as the 800,000 Arab citizens from
Israel.
   The bearded, black-haired rabbi made his name with brutal,
hot-tempered rhetoric.
   American blacks were guilty of Jew hatred, he said. Arabs were
dogs. Jews who ignored this were lemmings. Another Holocaust was
imminent, he declared, and made his symbol a clenched fist under
the slogan ``Never again.''
   In Israel, the rabbi could gather thousands of fanatical young
Jews to march through the streets of Jerusalem shouting, ``Death to
the Arabs!''
   Many denounced him as a bigot and a demagogue. Others considered
him a freedom fighter.
   ``He was our King David,'' said Charles Cohen, who stood sobbing
with his wife in front of the hospital in a crowd of Orthodox Jews
hoisting Israeli flags and reciting Hebrew prayers.
   Martin Cohen, a New York lawyer and Kahane follower who was at
the hospital, called the slain rabbi a martyr. ``He stood for every
Jew who no longer wants to be kicked around, for every Jew who
remembers the Holocaust,'' he said.
   Kahane had no police protection. State Assemblyman Dov Hikind,
who represents the rabbi's old Brooklyn neighborhood, said Kahane
had refused it.
   ``He said that when his turn would come, when God called him, no
one could prevent it,'' said Hikind.
   The shooting occurred shortly after 9 p.m. at the New York
Marriott East Side. As the gunman fled he ran into 73-year-old
Irving Franklin, who was selling booklets for a Zionist group, and
shot him in the leg, police said.
   The gunman commandeered a taxi and rode a block before getting
out and opening fire on Officer Carlos Acosta, 55, who was standing
in front of a post office, police said. The bullet bounced off the
officer's bulletproof vest and struck him in the arm as he returned
fire, hitting Noseir, authorities said.
   Kahane founded the JDL in 1968 in New York. The JDL organized
classes in karate and weapons training and patrolled high-crime
neighborhoods. The group was linked to acts of violence, including
a 1972 firebombing in which one person was killed and 13 were
injured.
   After moving to Israel in 1971, Kahane founded the country's
Kach Party, which advocates the ouster of all Arabs from
Israeli-held territory and a ban on Jewish-Arab marriages. Its
symbol is a clenched fist inside a Star of David.
   Kahane, who renounced his U.S. citizenship to run for
Parliament, served four years but was barred from running for
re-election in 1988 after a law was passed banning parties that
have a racist platform.
   Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American-Jewish Organizations, said Kahane ``had strong supporters
and opponents.''
   ``Whatever one thought about his political program, his shocking
assassination will be deplored by friends and foes alike,'' he
said.
   The president of the American-Arab Relations Committee, Dr. M.
T. Mehdi, said he ``disagreed with the rabbi's every assumption
during our many radio and TV debates concerning Zionist claims to
Palestine.''
   ``But we maintained cordial relations and I found Kahane more

   ``While we totally disapproved of his politics and rhetoric on
the Middle East, we strongly condemn this deliberate act of
terrorism,'' said a statement issued Monday night by the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, nonprofit insitution for the
study of the Holocaust.
   ``The (center) is shocked at word of the cold-blooded murder of
Rabbi Meir Kahane,'' it said.
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, said he disagreed strongly with Kahane's
politics but added, ``I nevertheless deeply regret his violent
end.''
   ``He did not deserve to die by an assassin's bullet,'' Schindler
said.
   Kahane is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
   His funeral was scheduled for today at the Young Israel of Ocean
Parkway Synagogue in Brooklyn.
   His body was to be flown to Israel.

<HEAD>Singh, Facing No-Confidence Vote, Fights To Keep Rivals From Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh, his
government heading for collapse in Parliament, sought Tuesday to
keep party defectors from taking power.
   Singh's government faces a no-confidence vote in Parliament on
Wednesday, following Hindu-Moslems riots which killed at least 360
people in two weeks.
   The issue - Moslem possession of a site Hindus claim as the
birthplace of an important Hindu god - prompted the desertion of
the right-wing Hindu party from Singh's coalition and was the
immediate spark of the political crisis.
   Even before the riots, Singh was beset by other problems. At
least 148 people died in protests after he announced in August he
would reserve nearly half of all government for low caste Hindus.
   He said the policy would raise the lower classes from economic
and social impoverishment. But critics said Singh manufactured the
caste problem to gain votes from the poor masses, while he failed
to follow through with economic liberalization and ignored the
increasingly deadly sepoaratist insurrections by Moslems in Kashmir
and by Sikhs in Punjab.
   Singh's parliamentary maneuvering on the eve of Wednesday's vote
created confusion and seemed to move the nation closer to elections
just 11 months after the last national vote.
   In a last-ditch effort to save his government, the prime
minister said he was ready to join a sweeping coalition, presumably
encompassing the opposition Congress Party. But that option seemed
unlikely to win much support.
   ``The need of the hour is a national government or a national
coalition to look into the serious crisis the country is facing,''
he said.
   Singh's Janata Dal party split on Monday. The leader of the
rebel faction, Chandra Shekhar, said he would join an alternative
government with the help of Congress, the largest party in the
legislature.
   Congress leader and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi swung
behind Chandra Shekhar, pledging to support him for prime minister
and not to seek the post for himself.
   Chandra Shekhar said Monday he had the support of 58 of the
Janata Dal's 140 members in the Lok Sabha, the all-important lower
house of Parliament.
   But Singh moved quickly to block recognition of the group as a
new party, expelling Chandra Shekhar and 24 of his supporters from
the Janata Dal.
   Under a law designed to prevent individuals from crossing the
floor, any breakaway faction must carry one-third of the party's
members.
   Those whom Singh expelledstay in Parliament as independents,
but the 33 other rebels technically remain trapped in the Janata
Dal and are obliged to vote according to party lines.
   If they defect, taking less than one-third of the remaining 115
Janata Dal members, they forfeit their Parliament seats.
   Chandra Shekhar, in a letter to the house which barely concealed
his anger, said it was ``public knowledge'' that he commanded the
support of more than the required one-third. He accused Singh of
acting ``with an evil design.''
   Singh responded that the splinter group had no mandate from the
voters to form a government.
   ``Apart from technicalties, there is a poltical context,'' he
told reporters. ``By some manipulation, some group is formed which
has no validity or sanction of the people as they have voted.''
   The chaos gives Ramaswamy Venkataraman, the 80-year-old
president of India, considerable leeway in deciding the nation's
course.
   If Singh loses the confidence vote and resigns, Venkataraman can
ask another member to form a government, or he can dissolve
Parliament and call an election.
   Venkataraman has been holding daily meetings with political
leaders and constitutional lawyers since the political crisis broke
two weeks ago.

   No matter how they voted in Tuesday's
election, some residents of the Bristol Bay region were sure to end
up with a turkey.
   The Bristol Bay Native Association said it would give away a
planeload of the birds to the village in the area that had the
highest voter turnout.
   ``I think that it's really critical that everybody in Alaska,
particularly in rural Alaska, gets out and votes,'' said Terry
Hoefferle, the native association's executive director.
   Topping the statewide ballot was a five-way race for governor.
The leading candidates were state Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski, a
Republican, Democratic former Anchorage mayor Tony Knowles and
former Gov. Wally Hickel, who jumped party ranks to run as an
independent. Green Party candidate Jim Sykes and Political Party
candidate Jim O'Callaghan rounded out the race.
   The native association planned to airlift $500 worth of turkeys
- probably about 80 birds - to the winning village in time for
Thanksgiving, Hoefferle said. Only villages with 30 or more
registered voters would be eligible.

<TEXT>
   A Pan Am security manager said Tuesday
that before the Flight 103 bombing, the airline investigated a
warning that one of its U.S.-bound flights would be a target but
determined it was a hoax.
   Jim Berwick, Pan Am security manager at London's Heathrow
Airport at the time of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing, told a public
inquiry that although the airline evaluated the warning made to the
U.S. Embassy in Helsinki as a hoax, it stepped up security.
   The inquiry into the disaster, which killed all 259 people on
board and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, 12 miles northeast of
Dumfries, is focusing only on the deaths and ways to prevent future
bombings, not on criminal responsibility. The inquiry began Oct. 1
and is expected to last three months.
   Scottish authorities are still investigating the crime,
inquiring into several radical Palestinian groups. And the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency is looking into a news report that one of
its agents might have unwittingly carried the bomb on board during
one of its undercover operations.
   At Tuesday's session, Berwick said that while he was in Brussels
Dec. 8, 1988, he heard from a colleague a warning that a Finnish
woman would be duped into carrying the bomb on board a Frankfurt to
New York flight.
   Berwick, who is now Pan American World Airways' managing ground
security coordinator at Heathrow, said he returned to London,
advised the U.S. Embassy regional security officer, asked the
Federal Aviation Authority in Brussels for more information and
flew to Helsinki the next day for a meeting at the airport.
   Officials later decided the threat was a hoax, Berwick said.
   But, he said, he made arrangements for all unaccompanied female
passengers to be treated as ``selectees'' - earmarked for further
security checks, and arranged for extra vigilance at Frankfurt.
   In a telex sent from Helsinki to Pan Am's New York headquarters,
Berwick said emphasis should be placed on the handling of
``interline'' baggage from Frankfurt - baggage being switched from
one airline to another.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and switched planes in London
before heading for New York.

<HEAD>Proposed Union Treaty Allows Secession, Demands Single Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Revolution Day, Bjt</HEAD>

   A Kremlin official on Tuesday outlined a new union
treaty that would guarantee civil liberties and republics' right to
secede, but he conceded the plan would fail without the agreement
of the Russian republic.
   ``If Russia does not sign it, we'll have to be realistic: We
would not be able to talk about any union,'' said Grigory Revenko,
a member of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Presidential Council,
a high-level advisory body.
   The proposal represented the government's latest attempt to
appease secession movements by the republics and smaller regions
while creating a uniform, market-oriented economic system in one
country. The treaty would replace a 1922 document that formed the
basis for the current union.
   But many details of the broad plan were unclear, and it faced an
uphill battle for acceptance by the national legislature and the
republics.
   The treaty would have a section defining human rights and
voluntary republic membership in the redefined Soviet Union.
Another would set out the Kremlin's military and economic
authority. A third would establish legislative, judicial and
executive branches of the central government, Revenko said.
   It would define the country as a ``union of sovereign
republic-states,'' and would amount to a ``second chapter'' to the
current constitution, he said.
   ``We do not need a union with somebody chained to it, because
that would lead to a constant attempt to break those chains,''
Revenko said.
   ``Republics ... will not have to expect any actions that would
stop sovereignty or independence. There will be no such actions.''
   The plan grew out of a proposal by Gorbachev last summer that
was widely criticized by the republics for failing to grant real
independence. Revenko said Gorbachev's ``ideas'' and a number of
variations later were reviewed by the Council of Federation,
another high-level advisory body representing presidents of the 15
republics and one autonomous region.
   The council agreed last week to have a preliminary proposal
published in the Soviet press in the next nine days. That would
bring ``the entire population into the discussion of the future of
the union,'' he said.
   Only after its publication, sometime before Nov. 15, could it be
considered by the national parliament, Revenko said.
   He gave no date for legislative debate, saying only that he
hoped the treaty could be approved in the next few months in
conjunction with Gorbachev's economic reform plan.
   ``The union treaty and the program of transition to the market
economy cannot go without each other,'' Revenko said. ``Political
issues would inevitably slow down the transition to the market. The
market would not tolerate any political or national isolation.''
   Gorbachev last month won approval of the compromise plan that
dropped provisions to allow private ownership and give more
authority to republics.
   Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin immediately rejected
the compromise. His parliament voted last week to proceed with the
more radical plan on its own territory, which occupies nearly
two-thirds of Soviet territory and possesses much of its raw
materials.
   The republic already has declared the primacy of its laws over
national laws and has moved to seize control of many of Russia's
assets. But it has not taken an official stance toward the union
treaty.
   The treaty would not require republics to belong to the union
and lets each decide whether its legislature or population would
vote on membership.
   While accepting that Russia might opt out of the treaty, Revenko
sounded a hopeful note.
   ``I believe Russia's responsibility for its own state is too
great, and that the politicians as well as the people of Russia
will come to understand that,'' he said.
   All but one of the 15 republics also have declared some form of
sovereignty from the Kremlin. Several have announced secession
drives and said they would join any new federation with Moscow on a
voluntary basis only.

<HEAD>Industrialist Sworn In As Pakistan's Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nawaz Sharif, an industrialist whose
political mentor was the late President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, on
Tuesday became prime minister of Pakistan.
   Sharif took the oath of office as head of Pakistan's fifth
freely elected government in 43 years in a ceremony attended by
military leaders, politicians and bureaucrats. He succeeds a
caretaker government set up after the dismissal last August of
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Also Tuesday, a special anti-terrorist court denied bail to Ms.
Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari. He has been jailed since Oct.
10 on charges of kidnapping and extortion.
   Zardari, 38, who was transferred to Islamabad on Sunday to take
his oath of office in the National Assembly, denies any wrongdoing.
He is under house arrest.
   The National Assembly chose Sharif to head the government after
a brief walkout Tuesday by Ms. Bhutto's supporters, who demanded a
secret ballot. They returned for the vote less than 10 minutes
later.
   Sharif won 153 votes to 39 for Mohammad Afzal Khan, a token
candidate put forth by Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party.
   In his acceptance speech, Sharif sounded a conciliatory note.
   ``The government and opposition should join hands to help the
country's poor. For the prosperity of the country, we have to join
hands,'' he said. He referred to the majority of Pakistan's 110
million people, most of whom are illiterate and landless laborers
earning less than $400 a year.
   In her address to the assembly, Ms. Bhutto recounted the
promises made by Sharif and his alliance during the bitter campaign
leading to the October elections. She urged lawmakers to strengthen
civilian institutions weakened by a quarter-century of military
rule.
   ``Increasing the authority of civilian institutions should not
be deterred by the fact that those who have tried before have been
stopped,'' she said.
   Sharif's election was assured last week when the Islamic
Democratic Alliance, a conservative coalition of 18 parties, named
him as its candidate for prime minister.
   The alliance controls 105 of the 217 seats in the National
Assembly, the policy-making lower house of Parliament, and claims
the support of several smaller parties and independents. Ms.
Bhutto's party was routed in the national election, leaving her
with only 45 seats.
   Sharif began his political career in the early 1980s when the
country was under military rule. His mentor, Gen. Zia, ousted Ms.
Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1977.
Bhutto was later executed.
   Zia died in a plane crash in August 1988, paving the way for the
first free elections after more than a decade of military rule.
   Shortly before the 1988 elections, Sharif formed the Islamic
alliance, a coalition espousing a wide range of political
ideologies and united only in contempt for Ms. Bhutto.
   The People's Party won the largest bloc of votes in the 1988
election but required the support of smaller parties and
independents to gain power and install Ms. Bhutto as the first
woman leader of a modern Moslem nation.
   After 20 months in power, Ms. Bhutto was dismissed by the
president, who charged her with political corruption and
incompetence.
   She faces seven charges of misconduct and abuse of power. A
guilty verdict on any one charge could banish her from politics for
up to seven years. Ms. Bhutto denies any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Nation's Major Airlines Improve On-Time Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest airlines improved their
on-time performance in September, achieving their best record in
the past two years.
   They also set a record for the fewest reports of lost or
mishandled baggage.
   The Department of Transportation, releasing its monthly Air
Travel Consumer Report, said Tuesday the nation's 12 largest
airlines reported that 84.3 percent of their flights arrived on
time in September.
   That's an improvement from the August record when only 78.5
percent of flights arrived on time.
   The department, which began tabulating arrival records in
September 1987, said September's performance was topped only in
September 1988, when 85.6 percent of flights arrived at the airport
gate on time.
   Delays caused by mechanical problems are not counted in the
Transportation Department's monthly report. A flight is reported
``on time'' if it arrived less than 15 minutes after the scheduled
arrival time.
   Pan American posted the best on-time performance for the month
with 89.5 percent of its arrivals reported to have arrived on
schedule.
   Other prompt arrivals were posted by Eastern, 88.2 percent;
America West, 86.5 percent; and American, 85.7 percent.
   Reports of mishandled baggage filed by passengers against the 12
airlines averaged 5.63 per 1,000 passengers in September. The best
previous record was 5.71 percent set in September 1988. In August,
reports of mishandled baggage averaged 6.71 for every 1,000
passengers.

   The Marine Corps on Tuesday called to active
duty hundreds of combat forces from reserve units across the
country, marking the first use of American citizen-soldiers in
combat roles in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   At the same time the Pentagon announced that more than 230,000
U.S. forces are now in the gulf area as part of Operation Desert
Shield. That is 20,000 more than the previous Pentagon count given
Oct. 23.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Desert Shield deployments
are continuing, but he declined to comment on what the additional
forces would be.
   ``Stay tuned'' for announcements of new deployments, he told
reporters.
   Williams also disclosed that the aircraft carrier battle group
Independence had left the gulf area after being replaced by the
carrier USS Midway. The spokesman said he could not comment on
where the Independence was headed. Navy officials have said it is
due back in the United States before Christmas.
   The Marine reserve call-up appeared to indicate that Gen. Al
Gray, the Marine commandant, is preparing the first stage of a
troop rotation to relieve the expeditionary force that has been
stationed in the gulf since shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. About 45,000 Marines are in the gulf area.
   Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Marine
reserves would be assigned to the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade
at Camp Pendleton, Calif. He said he could not comment on whether
they eventually would deploy to the gulf.
   Gen. John R. Dailey, the deputy commandant, said in an interview
Monday that the Marines have prepared about 55,000 regular Marines
for possible deployment to the gulf area. He said no decision had
been made on whether any or all of those would be used to increase
the force in the gulf or to rotate there as replacements.
   The call-up of Marine reserves, while not significantly
increasing U.S. combat capability in the gulf, marks an important
departure for the Pentagon. It opens the way to possible use of
major Army reserve combat units in Desert Shield.
   Williams denied published reports that the Pentagon has decided
to activate major Army combat reserve units. He said Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney had not yet granted the Army the necessary
authority to order combat reserves to active duty.
   ``That is an option we'll certainly consider, but no decision
has been made,'' Williams said.
   The spokesman suggested for the first time that Cheney was
uncertain whether major combat units from the Army reserves are
properly prepared for battle in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's something of an untested question,'' Williams said. He
indicated that any Army combat reserves called to active duty would
be given extra training in desert warfare at the Army's National
Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., and their readiness then
evaluated before deciding to send them to the gulf.
   ``You don't want to send anyone there until you have full faith
and confidence - in a tested environment - in their ability to
defend themselves,'' Williams said.
   All of the more than 34,000 Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard
and Marine Corps reserves called to active duty for Desert Shield
prior to Tuesday's Marine announcement are performing non-combat
roles such as medical services and water purification.
   The Marine reserve call-up includes 824 personnel, of which 633
are from units with combat functions, although all 824 will be part
of a Marine air-ground task force that itself is a combat unit.
Those not counted by the Marines as combat forces include
translators, interrogators, truck drivers and military police.
   All reserves called to active duty so far are on 90-day tours.
Williams said Cheney has asked President Bush to grant him the
authority to extend those tours by an additional 90 days.

   Supporters of the slain Rabbi Meir Kahane
shouted ``Death to the Arabs!'' on Tuesday, and Israeli reports
said police suspected a Jewish extremist already had retaliated by
killing two elderly Palestinians.
   The day brought a second tragedy for Kahane's wife, Libby, when
her father died after a long illness. Rabbi Yacov Blum had been
unconscious and did not know of his son-in-law's death.
   Police and army reinforcements were deployed around Israel and
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent violence. But
the increased security came too late to save two Palestinians
killed at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, about two hours after Kahane was
slain in New York City.
   Israeli police said they suspected an Israeli radical killed the
Palestinians and that the slayings may have been prompted by
Kahane's murder, the national Itim news agency reported.
   Israel television said police received warnings of death threats
against Israeli Arab members of Parliament and Palestinian leaders
in the occupied territories.
   Kahane was slain in New York Monday night by a gunman believed
to be of Arab descent. Israel army radio said the man, identifiedby police
as El Sayed A. Noseir, 34, formerly lived in the occupied
terrritories.
   Palestinians in Israel said the name as given by police was not
typical and might be Said Nasser or Nasser el-Said.
   The 58-year-old Kahane, a former member of Parliament and
founder of the right-wing Kach movement, advocated the expulsion of
all Arabs from Israeli-held territory.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Kahane's assassination was
``an unprecedented assault on an Israeli political figure on
American soil'' and urged the United States to increase security
against terrorism.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the killing
``a despicable and cowardly act.'' Asked about a possible vendetta
by Kahane supporters, he said: ``We don't see this as a time for
revenge. Now is the time for restraint.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar also decried
Kahane's killing and violence in the occupied territories. ``He
deplores these and all acts of violence,'' said a spokeswoman,
Nadia Younes.
   Several Israeli leaders linked Kahane's murder to his
controversial views.
   Faisal Hussein, a Palestine Liberation Organization supporter in
Jerusalem, appealed for calm, saying: ``Violence and calling for
violence will lead nowhere.''
   He said Tuesday's killings in the West Bank ``raised concerns
about the security of our people.''
   At least two Israeli Arab members of Parliament, Abdel Wahab
Daroushe and Mohammed Miari, left Jerusalem for their homes in
northern Israel for fear of reprisals. Daroushe said police told
him of the threats.
   Tuesday's Parliament session began with a minute of silence for
Kahane, but only about 30 of the 120 lawmakers were present.
   Kahane supporters warned of possible revenge attacks.
   Noam Federman, a Kahane spokesman, declined to say if the Kach
movement was behind killings of the two Palestinians on Tuesday.
But he told Israel television that ``I don't rule out that after
the murder of Rabbi Kahane, Jews will rise up and will honor his
memory ... and will attack Arabs.''
   David Ben Dor, a Kach leader, told a news conference at Kach's
Jerusalem headquarters that Kahane's ideas will survive.
   ``Whoever thinks that today Rabbi Kahane and the Kach movement
have been destroyed has made a great mistake,'' Ben Dor said.
   He spoke beside Kach flags, their yellow fields centered by a
black Jewish star and a clenched fist. About 50 supporters milled
about, some shouting ``Death to the Arabs!''
   The crowd was hostile to journalists, at one point throwing
chairs at reporters. An Israeli television crewman was beaten by
Kach supporters, and one sprayed tear gas in his face. He was
hospitalized.
   Villagers said the killings in the West Bank village of Lubban
Sharqiya near Nablus occurred at about 6 a.m. They said a man
wearing civilian clothes drove into the village in a white car
bearing Israeli license plates.
   The man stopped and opened fire with a Uzi submachine gun, the
villagers said, killing Mohammed al-Khatib, 65, who was riding his
donkey to harvest olives from his grove. The gunman then drove on,
stopping a second time to kill Miriam Khassan, 60, outside her
house, the villagers said.
   Israel radio police reporter Moshe Nussbaum said that before
news of the West Bank killings was broadcast, an anonymous caller
speaking Hebrew told him ``to check in one of the villages near
Nablus, two Arabs were killed there.''
   The deaths raised to 773 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians in the nearly 35-month Palestinian
uprising. An additional 294 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs. Fifty-one Israelis have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Preached Armed Militance To Counter Jewish Image</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Kahane Shot, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meir Kahane preached that for Jews to survive
they had to change the world's perception of the Jew as patsy - a
passive victim.
   To this end, he launched the Jewish Defense League in New York
1968 and led it in sometimes violent, high-visibility
confrontations against anti-Semitism.
   Most Jewish organizations condemned his philosophy and tactics.
   The JDL picketed and created disturbances at performances of
Soviet singers and dancers during the days Moscow blocked Jewish
emigration. The young militants staged sit-ins at the offices of
Columbia Artists Management, which booked the tours of Soviet
companies.
   Then came a darker escalation. JDL members were convicted of
bombings of the offices of Amtorg, the Soviet trading company, in
1971 and Sol Hurok, another booker of Russian talent, in 1972. A
secretary died in the Hurok bombing.
   JDL members also admitted planting dynamite at the Soviet
diplomatic residence at Glen Cove, on Long Island, in 1971.
   While he was arrested many times on charges relating to
disorderly protests, Kahane never was convicted of personally
participating in a bombing.
   In July 1971, two months before he moved to Israel, Kahane was
given a five-year suspended sentence and fined $5,000 on a federal
conviction of conspiring to manufacture explosives.
   Judge Jack B. Weinstein, sentencing Kahane and two teen-age
members of the JDL, admonished that ``it is not permissible to
substitute the bomb for the book as the symbol of Jewish manhood.''
He ordered Kahane to have nothing more to do with guns or bombs.
   But Kahane, jubilant at having avoided prison, told reporters
outside the courtroom that he planned to buy rifles for all his
followers for self defense and proclaimed the motto, ``Every Jew a
.22.''
   News organizations during those days frequently received
anonymous calls claiming responsibility for violent acts against
perceived anti-Semitism. The callers would sign off with the JDL
slogan, ``Never again,'' a reference to Jews dying in the
Holocaust.
   Official spokesmen for the JDL, however, had a formula comment
in which they denied the deed but said the JDL sympathized with the
motive.
   A decade later, during one of his frequent visits from Israel,
Kahane told a Washington reporter: ``We bombed the Russian mission
in New York, the Russian cultural mission here, the Soviet trade
offices.''
   He said the bombs put Soviet Jews on Page 1. ``Our violence was
a very well-thought-out political movement,'' he said.
   Going against the grain was part of Kahane's nature.
   Kahane, son and grandson of rabbis from what is now Israel, was
born Aug. 1, 1932, and raised in Flatbush. In the home of the
Brooklyn Dodgers, the young Kahane rooted for the New York Yankees.
   He said growing up as a Yeshiva student in a mixed neighborhood
meant ``I had fights regularly over my yarmulke (skull cap), and
then afterwards I'd drink beer with them. ... Once you did it, it
was over. Once you fight and you get bloodied, if you bloody back,
then you're OK.''
   The slaughter of Europe's Jews during World War II was always in
the forefront of his thoughts, but he accused mainstream Jews of
forgetting the lesson.
   ``To turn the other cheek is not a Jewish concept,'' he insisted
when organizing the JDL. ``Do not listen to the soothing anesthesia
of the Establishment. They walk in the paths of those whose
timidity helped to bury our brothers and sisters less than 30 years
ago.''
   He said in an interview in 1971: ``I'd rather be respected,
feared and safe than loved, with eulogies.''
   To counter the view of Jews as patsies, he ran an ad in The New
York Times with a photo of armed young members and a caption: ``Is
this any way for nice Jewish boys to behave?'' The text of the ad
said it was.
   Kahane claimed membership of 14,000. Unsympathetic observers
conceded that Kahane's message had appeal to high school and
college youths, but maintained actual membership was only in the
hundreds.

<HEAD>Faulkner Photographer Dead at Age 63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Cofield, who along with his father
served as William Faulkner's personal photographer, has died after
an extended illness. He was 63.
   Cofield's book, ``William Faulkner: The Cofield Collection,''
included the internationally known set of photographs that
chronicled the life of the reclusive, Nobel Prize-winning author.
Cofield's father, ``Col.'' J.R. Cofield, took some of the
photographs.
   Much of the collection was reprinted from scrapbooks and
contained personalized captions by J.R. Cofield.
   Parts of the collection, some of it autographed by Faulkner,
burned in a studio fire in 1986, but most of the negatives were
saved and are now in the possession of the family.
   Cofield, who died Monday, took the last formal portraits of
Faulkner before the author's death in 1962. The photographs were
used for the commemorative Faulkner postage stamp and have appeared
in hundreds of books and publications around the world.
   Cofield also was a university photographer at the University of
Mississippi, his alma mater, from 1960-85.
   ``The photographic legacy of Jack and his father is a historic
treasure, which is enjoyed by Faulkner scholars from around the
world who visit Oxford and Ole Miss,'' said university Chancellor
R. Gerald Turner. ``His contributions to Ole Miss and the Ole Miss
family are everlasting.''
   He is survived by his wife, Martha Glenn, and four children.

   Rabbi Jacob Blum, father-in-law of the slain
Rabbi Meir Kahane, died Tuesday after a long illness, Israel radio
reported.
   Blum, father of Kahane's wife Libby, was not aware of Kahane's
assassination Monday night in New York City, because he had been
unconscious for days, the radio said.
   Family members denied rumors that Blum died of a heart attack
after hearing about Kahane's shooting. They gave no further details
about Blum or his illness.
   The office of Kahane's Kach Party also had no details on Blum
and officials at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, where Blum died,
refused to disclose any information about him.
   Israeli journalists said Blum was in his 70s and apparently had
suffered from a heart condition. He was an investigator for the New
York State Department of Welfare before immigrating to Israel and
settling in Jerusalem.
   New York-born Kahane, 58, founder of Israel's extremist
anti-Arab Kach party, was shot to death after a speech in
Manhattan. His assailant, who was wounded in an exchange of gunfire
with a postal police officer, is believed to be of Arab descent.

   Nicholas Mosley's novel, ``Hopeful Monsters,'' won
Britain's Whitbread award for best novel on Tuesday.
   ``Hopeful Monster,'' a love story spanning much of this
century, chronicles the marriage of Max Ackerman, son of a
Cambridge University botanist, and Eleanor Anders, a brilliant
German Jew, and their experiences in Hitler's Germany and the
Spanish Civil War and with the rise of Stalinism.
   A record 400 books were entered in this year's Whitbread
contest, which is divided into five categories, each carrying a
prize of $3,400.
   All the winners will compete for the $40,000 Whitbread Book of
the Year prize, to be announced in January.
   Peter Dickinson's ``AK,'' about an African war orphan's
relationship with his rifle, won the best children's novel
category.
   Hanif Kureishi's ``The Buddha of Suburbia'' won the best first
novel category; ``Daddy, Daddy'' by Paul Durcan was judged the best
poetry entrant; and the best biography award went to Ann Thwaite
for her biography of British author A.A. Milne, titled ``A.A.
Milne: His Life.''
   Mosley has written another well-received novel, ``Accident,''
and a two-volume biography of his father, Sir Oswald Mosley, the
British fascist leader who died in 1980.

   The standup comedy show ``Comic Strip Live''
will replace ``Against the Law'' on Fox Broadcasting Co. on Sunday
nights, and the police drama ``DEA'' is temporarily leaving the
air, the network said Tuesday.
   ``Against the Law,'' the low-rated but critically praised
courtroom drama, will replace ``DEA'' in its 9 p.m. EST Friday time
slot on Nov. 16, and ``DEA'' will return later this season, Fox
said.
   ``We think this move will help our schedule on Fox's most

Entertainment Group. ``The viewers have told us that they want and
expect comedy from us on Sunday nights.''
   ``Comic Strip Live'' outperformed ``Against the Law'' in two
Sunday night tryouts earlier this season, Fox executives noted.
   The standup comedy show will continue to air on late night
Saturday, retitled as ``Comic Strip: Late Night,'' Fox said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush awaited midterm election
results in the privacy of the White House on Tuesday, choosing to
remain on the sidelines after campaigning extensively for scores of
Republican candidates.
   Ending a six-day political trip, Bush and his wife Barbara
returned in early afternoon after voting in Houston, their dopted
home city.
   The first couple voted at a polling place in a nursing home on
the west side of Houston - a few blocks from the Houstonian Hotel,
where a suite of rooms serves as the Bushes' legal voting
residence.
   Asked by reporters as he was waiting on line to vote if he cared
to make a prediction, Bush said, ``Good way to go to jail.''
   ``They're trying to get you arrested,'' Mrs. Bush joked to her
husband.
   Politicking is prohibited in polling places.
   However, Bush's chief of staff John Sununu, whose abrasive
tactics in dealing with Congress are blamed by some White House
staffers for contributing to Bush's decline in popularity, had no
hesitancy in discussing politics.
   Sununu said he was sticking with his prediction, made on a
television talk show on Sunday, that Republicans would lose no more
than one Senate seat and between four and 12 House seats.
   While some Republicans distanced themselves from Bush for his
wavering stand on budget and tax issues, Sununu defended the
campaign support provided by the White House.
   ``The motivation factor, the energizing the campaign - those are
all pluses,'' Sununu said.
   ``You can't make a winning campaign out of a campaign that
couldn't win anyway. And you can't cause a campaign that's on a
landslide to lose. But what you can do is help in those marginal
races. And that's what, if you're doing it right, you focus on,''
he added.
   Over the past year and a half, Bush attended 115 campaign events
in 35 states and raised nearly $90 million for Republicans. For the
last two weeks, he has been campaigning virtually nonstop.
   However, he saw his popularity - and his appeal as a campaigner
to other Republicans - drop sharply in October because of the
budget debacle.
   Sununu suggested Bush had decided against making any public
statements on politics on Election Day.
   After voting, Bush again ignored reporters' questions and
quickly stepped into his limousine. ``I don't want them to get me
for loitering, so I'll go on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Funerals Draw Thousands in Separatist Region of Moldavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people turned out Tuesday in the
eastern Moldavian city of Dubossary for the funerals of three
separatists killed last week in ethnic clashes, news reports said.
  The mourners, representing cities and villages throughout the
Dniester region of Moldavia where about 200,000 Russians and
Ukrainians live, filled Victory Square, the Tass news agency
reported. The independent Interfax news agency said tens of
thousands of people attended.
   Three people were killed Friday in ethnic fighting after Russian
and Ukrainian separatists who proclaimed their own ``Dniester
republic'' in the area seized government buildings in Dubossary and
blocked roads leading to the city. A fourth person identified as a
Moldavian policeman reportedly died Monday of injuries suffered in
the clash.
   In the southern part of the republic, a special commission of
the Moldavian parliament held talks with representatives of another
separatist group, the Turkish-Christian Gagauz minority, Tass
reported.
   The Moldavian parliamentary commission was headed by the
republic's Communist Party leader, Peter Luchinsky.
   The Gagauz, who number about 150,000, declared sovereignty Aug.
18 and announced elections for an autonomous government. Moldavian
nationalists, numbering tens of thousands, rushed to confront the
Gagauz but pulled back after negotiations started.
   Because of the ethnic unrest, city authorities in Moldavia's
capital of Kishinev canceled the traditional military parade, civil
march and other rallies scheduled for Wednesday's celebration of
the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Tass reported.
   The Gagauz and Dniester separatists say they are the targets of
discrimination by the Moldavians, who themselves are seeking
independence from the Soviet Union. Two-thirds of the 4.3 million
people in the republic bordering Romania speak Moldavian, a
language identical to Romanian except for Cyrillic characters.
   A group of women in Dubossary began a hunger strike last week
seeking the resignation of Moldavian Prime Minister Mircha Druk and
the punishment of those to blame for the deaths of the separatists,
Tass reported.
   But Lyudmilla Skalnaya, head of Moldavia's Women's Council,
appealed for an end to the hunger strike, the news agency said.
   ``We women have lost three sons, and six children were left
without fathers in nonsensical clashes in the area of Dubossary,''
Tass quoted her as saying.

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was the most-watched show on
television for the fifth time this season, but CBS is moving close
to NBC in ratings for the season to date, according to Nielsen
ratings released Tuesday.
   NBC's saloon comedy, which celebrates its 200th episode on
Thursday, averaged a 22.4 rating, helping the Peacock Network win
the week with an average prime-time rating of 13.5.
   CBS, whose ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder She Wrote'' each had
their highest ratings since the season began, was second last week
with a 12.6. ABC was third with an 11.9. Each ratings point
represents 931,000 homes.
   However, CBS' season-to-date margin is much closer to NBC and is
making the ratings race tighter than had been ancipated, said NBC
research vice president Preston Beckman.
   Although NBC still leads with a 13.3 average, CBS, trying to
rebound from three consecutive seasons as third in prime time
ratings, now has a 13.0 average for the season so far. ABC is third
with a 12.5.
   `It's a much tighter race - CBS is making it even tighter that
we thought'' it would be, Beckman said. He credited part of CBS'
surge with the Nielsen performances of CBS' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women'' and ``60 Minutes.''
   In last week's battle of The Cos vs. Bart, NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' easily bested Fox Broadcasting's half-hour ``The Simpsons.''
The former averaged an 18.6 to the 15.8 for the Fox show when the
two directly competed with each other, and NBC's show averaged a
20.2 rating for the full hour.
   A special Monday showing of Burt Reynolds' ``Evening Shade'' CBS
comedy also fared well. It was 24th in the rankings with a 15.1
average, far better than the 9.5 rating and No. 57 ranking of its
regular Friday broadcast.
   In the news wars, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the Nielsen
battle for the 43rd consecutive week. It averaged an 11.4, well
ahead of the 10.0 for the ``CBS Evening News'' and the 9.5 of the
``NBC Nightly News.''
   The week's top 10 list was dominated by old reliables, save for
NBC's showing of the movie hit, ``Three Men and a Baby,'' and ABC's
new ``America's Funniest People.'' They were, respectively, fourth
and 10th in the rankings, with NBC's movie getting a 19.9 rating,
and ABC's show an 18.0.
   After ``Cheers,'' the other top-rated shows and their ratings
were ``60 Minutes,'' 21.4; Bill Cosby's show, 20.2; CBS'
``Designing Women'' and ABC's ``Roseanne,'' each 19.1; ``Murder She
Wrote'' and ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' each 18.8,
and CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' 18.7.
   Fox's ``American Chronicles'' occupied the Nielsen cellar,
averaging a 2.6 rating.

Chemicals</HEAD>

   A Navy warship intercepted and diverted from
the northern Red Sea a German-flagged cargo ship carrying chemicals
not listed on the ship's manifest, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said he did not know what kind
of chemicals were aboard the Red Sea Europa when it was diverted
last Friday by the crew of the cruiser USS Biddle.
   The Pentagon said it could not say where the cargo ship had come
from or where it was headed.
   The presence of a shipment of chemicals in the vicinity of Iraq
is especially sensitive because of international concerns about
Iraq's chemical warfare capabilities.
   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, said his group was alarmed at the disclosure
of a German-flagged ship carrying undocumented chemicals in the Red
Sea.
   He said U.S. authorities should be investigating the incident in
view of evidence that German companies in the past have supplied
Iraq with chemicals used to manufacture chemical weapons.
   The Biddle is part of a multinational naval force in the Red Sea
and Persian Gulf area that is enforcing the U.N. trade embargo
against Iraq. Commercial ships carrying goods to Iraq in violation
of the embargo, or whose cargo includes items not listed on the
ship's manifest, are routinely forced to divert.
   Williams said the diversion of the Red Sea Europa was the 16th
since the embargo was put in place last August following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.

   As Americans voted at home on
Tuesday, the U.S. Army was practicing war games, the Marines were
testing night vision goggles, the Navy was enforcing trade
sanctions on Iraq and the Air Force was flying sorties along the
Kuwaiti border.
   In other words, it was just another day in Saudi Arabia.
   True, Army Spec. Everett Thornton, 22, of Alexandria, La.,
discussed the senatorial race in North Carolina over breakfast. And
Army Maj. Steve Fernell, 38, of Kansas City, Mo., remembered seeing
a picture of Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic candidate for
governor of California.
   But for most servicemen in Operation Desert Shield, squared off
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces, it was just
Tuesday, not Election Day, and that meant more training to prepare
in case of war.
   Elements of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, the first
American unit to arrive in Saudi Arabia following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, took to the firing range for drills with
machine guns, rifles, shotguns, grenades, anti-tank rockets and
trench warfare.
   At one air base, U.S. F-15 fighters took off in pairs, heading
north toward the Kuwaiti border and at a Saudi port, small U.S.
Coast Guard patrol boats were enforcing security.
   ``I did not realize it was election day,'' said Capt. Michael
Wills, 27, of Wapakoneta, Ohio, with the Army's 12th Aviation
Brigade, who was on the tarmac at an airbase. ``There are a lot of
other things to talk about here.''
   The main topic, he said, is ``probably the man across the
border.''
   The consensus?
   ``He's crazy.''
   Army Lt. Kevin Klutz said he had no idea that it was Election
Day, ``We're more concerned about the mission here.''
   The military distributed about 100,000 applications for absentee
ballots among the 220,000 U.S. troops in the gulf and a handful of
GIs voted by fax. Servicemen could also send away for their own
ballots.
   The Judge Advocate's Office in the Army Forces Central Command,
which ran a three-week ``Get Out The Vote'' blitz, had no figures
on how many servicemen actually got absentee ballots and voted.
   Even on Election Day, Army Staff Sgt. Patrick Jewell, of Santa
Barbara, Calif., was hoping to vote.
   ``They say we're going to get the opportunity to vote. We
haven't got the ballots yet, but I'm sure we will,'' he said.
   Some thought the elections would affect the policy toward the
gulf, others thought international pressure would be more
important.
   But enlisted men have never been avid voters.
   Said Army Pvt. 1 Scott Lynch of Downing Town, Pa. with the 82nd
Airborne. ``It's only senators and congressman and all of that so
it's really not that big a deal to us. We have more important
things to do, definitely more important things to do.''

   The Angel Island Immigration Station was
dubbed the Ellis Island of the West, but Chinese immigrants
detained there remember it more as a prison than a gateway to
freedom.
   The island was a land of fear, not hope, for the Chinese who
often gave false names and lied about their histories to escape the
immigration center that closed 50 years ago Monday.
   The island marked another anniversary Tuesday - the 140th
anniversary of its establishment as a military base.
   Today, Angel Island is part of the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area under the National Park Service. The island, three
miles north of San Francisco, is the largest island in San
Francisco Bay.
   Him Mark Lai's father was among the first group of Chinese
processed at the station.
   ``Like of a lot of people, my father had to lie about who he was
and where he came from,'' Lai said Monday. ``He never talked about
Angel Island. I found out about it after his death when I was going
through his papers.''
   The lies were necessary because strict immigration laws, such as
the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, allowed entry from China only to
merchants, scholars, tourists and children of U.S. citizens.
   Chinese laborers and peasants with dreams of opportunity in
America were barred.
   The Chinese Exclusion Act wasn't repealed until 1943.
   Lai's father, Bing Lai, said he was born of a Chinese-American -
a story that couldn't be discredited since birth records were
destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire in San Francisco.
   Bing Lai, who died in 1976, also dropped his real surname, Mark.
   ``I guess he always had a fear that he would be caught and
discovered by immigration and then sent back to China,'' said Him
Mark Lai, co-author of a book about Angel Island.
   Some 175,000 Chinese who came to the United States between 1910
and 1940 spent time on Angel Island.
   The station was closed in 1940, after a fire that destroyed part
of the two-story wooden buildings that housed as many as 300
Chinese immigrants at a time.
   The buildings, which are being restored, also carry evidence of
the frustration some immigrants felt on the island. Riots sometimes
broke out to protest the food quality and confined quarters.
   ``This place is called an island of immortals,'' one anonymous
poet wrote. ``But as a matter of fact, the mountain wilderness is a
prison. The bird plunges in even though it sees the open net.
Because of poverty one can do naught else.''
   John Yeehall Chin, who was 16 years old when he arrived at Angel
Island, said his first month in America was disheartening, but he
was glad to escape the poverty of his life in China.
   ``They told me America was wealthy, beautiful, a wonderful
country, but when I came here I was alone on the island and I was
scared all the time until I knew they would let me go,'' said Chin,
82, of San Francisco.
   Chin's immigration application was accepted after authorities
questioned him for three hours - a routine interrogation that could
result in deportation if immigrants gave the wrong answers.
   ``I remember I got out one week before the Fourth of July,''
Chin said. ``I jumped up and down and went to a Chinese-American
picnic. I was very happy. ... It was worth the pain.''

<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Joseph Ada posted an easy victory
Tuesday, making the Republican the first governor to win
back-to-back terms in the U.S. territory's history.
   With all 76 precincts reporting, Ada received 20,677 votes to
Democrat Madeleine Bordallo's 15,688 votes, the Guam Election
Commission reported.
   Final official tallies are expected Wednesday, the commission
said.
   The abortion issue was not a factor in the vote, as both
candidates oppose abortion and support a court challenge to a
decision striking down the territory's restrictive abortion law.
   Bordallo, the first woman and non-native Guamanian to run for
governor, is the widow of former Gov. Ricardo Bordallo. Her husband
committed suicide Jan. 30, one day before he was to begin an
18-month federal prison term in California. He was not in office at
the time of his death.
   In the territory's congressional election, Republican Ben Blaz
won a fourth term as a non-voting delegate, defeating Democrat Ben
Pagelinan by 21,390 to 16,437.

<HEAD>Duvalier Loyalists Disqualified from Presidential Campaign</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Leading Haitians on Tuesday
welcomed the announcement that people linked to a brutal
dictatorship were barred from the presidential race. The move made
a leftist priest the front-runner.
   The Electoral Council on Monday night disqualified 10 of the 26
declared presidential candidates from running in the Dec. 16
general election. The ruling had been expected.
   The council said the 10 failed to comply with filing procedures
and were barred based on technicalities under the election law.
   They included Claude Raymond and Dr. Roger Lafontant, two
officials of the oppressive Duvalier family regime that ruled Haiti
for 29 years.
   The council said Lafontant wasn't cleared by the government
auditing office on his handling of public funds while serving as
minister of the interior and defense. It also said he didn't
provide a birth certificate.
   Raymond, a former army chief of staff, was disqualified because
he didn't register until after the Oct. 21 filing deadline.
   There was no immediate reaction from any of the disqualified
candidates.
   ``I foresee a relatively normal unfolding of the electoral
process now,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights activist and
leader of the Congress of Democratic Movements, a socialist party.
   Many Haitians feared possible retaliation by Duvalier supporters
and they jammed stores Monday night to stock on supplies. There
were no incidents as of Tuesday afternoon.
   When 12 Duvalierists were barred from running for president in
1987, dozens of people were killed. On election day, armed men in
collusion with the army killed at least 34 voters.
   Raymond has been publicly accused of participating in that
massacre. He has never been charged.
   Lafontant ran the Duvalier's private paramilitary militia, the
Tonton Macoutes, who terrorized this poor Caribbean nation of 6
million people.
   There's an outstanding arrest warrant charging Lafontant with
conspiring against national security, but it has never been served.
   The Duvalier dictatorship ended in February 1986 when
Jean-Claude Duvalier, son of the late Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, fled to exile in France.
   But political turmoil and violence have continued despite
Duvalier's fall. The interim government of President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, appointed in March, is the fifth since Duvalier
was ousted.
   Although other major candidates qualified, none appears to have
the pull of the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, an oustpoken critic of
Haiti's dictatorships.
   He has stirred the impoverished masses from the pulpit with
impassioned sermons. In 1988, the Roman Catholic Salesian Order
dismissed him from the order, alleging his sermons provoked
violence.
   His surprise candidacy appeared aimed at stopping Duvalierists
and was announced under the slogan: ``Operation Torrent to Block
the Path of Macoutes.''
   Dr. Louis Roy, head of the Council of State that rules alongside
the provisional government, said Aristide's campaign may lose
momentum with Lafontant's disqualification.
   ``But he remains the leading contender because he enjoys the
backing of the impoverished masses,'' Roy added. ``His candidacy
upset everyone's calculations, and he cannot be gotten around.''
   Other major candidates who qualified were Marc Bazin, a former
World Bank official; Silvio Claude, a former preacher; and Louis
Dejoie Jr., a businessman.
   It was expected the Electoral Council would disqualify
Duvalierists from running based on the 1987 constitution, which
bars criminal supporters of past dictators from running for office
until 1997.
   The election campaign officially opens Wednesday and closes Dec.
14.
   About 800 observers from the United Nations and the Organization
of American States will monitor the vote.

   Bishop Cahal B. Daly, a fierce
critic of the IRA and other guerrilla groups, was appointed Roman
Catholic primate of Ireland on Tuesday and said he will continue
his outspoken campaign for peace in his native Northern Ireland.
   Pope John Paul II named Daly as spiritual leader of 3.7 million
Catholics in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Daly succeeds Tomas O
Fiaich, who died in May, as the archbishop of Armagh and primate of
All-Ireland.
   ``My continuing concern will obviously be to work for an end to
the violence which has afflicted both our communities for two
disastrous decades,'' Daly told a news conference shortly after the
announcement.
   ``Refusing to give in to discouragement or to despair, we must
continue to believe in peace, to pray for peace, to speak peace, to
make peace, by being ourselves men and women of peace.''
   As the voice of the Catholic church in Belfast, as bishop of
Down and Connor, Daly has been a vigorous advocate for the Catholic
minority in the North but a foe of the Irish Republican Army.
   The IRA, Daly said two years ago, ``is a question of sheer evil
and we have got to face that evil and have no truck with it.''
   Supporters of the IRA, which is rooted in the Catholic
community, regard Daly as an apologist for British rule. The IRA is
waging a guerrilla war to drive the British from
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and merge the province with
the Irish Republic.
   Ireland's Anglican primate, Robin Eames, said he had the highest
respect for Daly's ``intellectual gifts, his courage and
integrity.''
   Peter Brooke, the highest-ranking British official in Northern
Ireland, said Daly was respected for ``his resolute condemnation of
violence, his concern for individual well-being and his
longstanding efforts to bring about reconciliation.''
   At 73, Daly is the oldest prelate appointed to the Armagh post
in 170 years. He must submit his resignation when he turns 75, the
normal retirement age for bishop, although the pope need not accept
it immediately.
   He is the 114th successor to St. Patrick. Daly's last six
predecessors were made cardinals.
   Daly enthusiastically joined in ecumenical ventures with
Anglican and Presbyterian leaders in Northern Ireland, but he also
vigorously defended Catholic schools against those who criticized
them as perpetuating old divisions.
   He was a defender of faith in a land where religions often are
badges of lethal political differences.
   In his ``Letter to a Northern Protestant,'' published in 1979,
Daly wrote:
   ``Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants can and must help one
another to stay faithful to Christ in a world where more and more
people walk away from Him. In that world, it is imbecilic to
suppose that Protestantism would gain through Catholicism's loss,
or vice versa ... only post-Christian secularism and materialism
will flourish if either of our faith-communities declines.''
   Born in 1917 in Loughguile, north of Belfast, Daly was ordained
in 1941. He earned a doctorate in divinity and did postgraduate
work in philosophy at the Sorbonne and the College de France.
   From 1946-67 he lectured on scholastic philosophy at Queen's
University in Belfast, then was appointed bishop of Ardagh and
Clonmacnois in central Ireland.
   Daly suffered a heart attack in 1982, but recovered and was
appointed that year as bishop of Down and Connor.
   Books he has written include ``Violence in Ireland and Christian
Conscience'' and ``Justice, the Work of Peace.''

<HEAD>Snow in Rockies and Plains, Rain and Wind in Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest in a series of storms produced heavy snow Tuesday in
the central Rockies and another weather system spread high wind and
heavy rain across the Northeast.
   Parts of Wyoming got heavy snow from late Monday into Tuesday.
Totals ranged up to 17 inches at Sinks Canyon, 7 miles southwest of
Lander; 13 inches at Lander; 12 inches at Togwotee Pass, 40 miles
northeast of Jackson; and up to a foot at Casper. Casper Mountain
got nearly 3 feet of snow in a 30-hour period, the National Weather
Service said.
   Snow also fell across parts of eastern Colorado and parts of
Nebraska. By daybreak, 3 inches of snow had fallen at Denver's
Stapleton Airport. Totals in north-central Nebraska ranged up to 12
inches at Greeley, with 7 inches reported at Erickson, O'Neillo and
Loretto.
   A winter storm watch was in effect into Wednesday for New
Mexico's central highlands and western mountains.
   Low pressure in southern Quebec spread rain and snow over
northern New England. In Maine, heavy rainfall for the six hours up
to 1 p.m. EST included 1.75 inches at Portland, 1.56 inches at
Brunswick and 1.03 inches at Augusta.
   Snowfall totals in northern Maine ranged up to 4 inches at Saint
Agatha by late morning.
   Strong west to northwest wind associated with the low pressure
system over southern Quebec buffeted much of the Northeast.
   In western New York state, wind gusted to 55 mph at Rochester
overnight. Wind gusted to 61 mph at Buffalo, and to 69 mph at
Dunkirk.
   The wind in western New York state downed utility poles, power
lines and large trees, causing scattered blackouts.
   In southern New England, winds gusted to 47 mph at Hartford,
Conn., early in the morning. Wind over eastern New York state
gusted to 48 mph at Rome during the afternoon.
   The storm crossing southern Canada also produced heavy snow in
Upper Michigan late Monday and into Tuesday. Totals in northern
Lower Michigan ranged up to 12 inches at Atlanta. Up to 6 inches of
snow was reported in eastern Upper Michigan.
   Low pressure developing over southern Nevada generated strong
and gusty wind in parts of California and Nevada.
   Strong, gusty wind blew over the San Francisco area, with gusts
to 31 mph at the airport early Tuesday morning.
   Afternoon temperatures were mostly in the 20s from the northern
and central high Plains to northern Minnesota, with readings in the
teens in Montana, wyoming and Colorado, and in the 20s and 30s over
much of the Rocky Mountain region.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 7 below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

   The 12-nation European Community on
Tuesday approved a plan for moderate reductions in farm subsidies,
resolving an impasse that had threatened to scuttle next month's
world trade talks.
   The proposal calls for trimming government payments on major
farm crops by 30 percent over 10 years, starting in 1986. Some cuts
have already been made.
   The community had failed to agree in six previous attempts.
   The plan now will be presented to negotiators in the Uruguay
Round talks, an ambitious four-year effort by about 100 nations to
overhaul the world trading system. Those talks are being held under
the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum
that advocates freer world trade.
   After two days of bargaining, the European trading bloc's
agriculture and trade ministers endorsed a carefully worded
proposal that sought to ease fears of some governments that the
reductions would badly hurt their farmers.
   French Agriculture Minister Louis Mermaz, who had been holding
up the agreement, described the outcome as ``excellent.''
   Mermaz said the proposal ``will enable the European Comunity to
start the negotiations with a united front, with an excessively
dynamic position.''
   The community is the last major player to put its offer on the
bargaining table, having missed an Oct. 15 deadline for submitting
positions for the final round of negotiations, which will begin in
less than a month.
   It was unlikely, though, that the offer would be warmly received
by the United States and other nations, which have demanded much
greater reductions in the community's costly farm support programs.
   The Bush administration wants its trading partners to slash farm
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent
over a 10-year period, starting in 1991.
   But Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero cautioned Tuesday,
``It would be a grave error on the part of our trading partners to
judge that this position is not (one) of great openness and
ambition.''
   France and Germany had held up the agreement by insisting on
guarantees that the cuts would not be too severe.
   In the end, the ministers adopted a list of assurances that
promised not only to compensate farmers for income losses, but to
make sure that cheaper, imported goods would not push home-grown
products off the market.
   It also pledges to limit the impact of the reductions on poor
regions in the community and to soften proposed cuts in supports
for olive oil and other products grown in Mediterranean countries.
   ``After long negotiations, we got very good improvements,'' said
German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle.
   Mermaz said, ``We have to look the Americans straight in the
face. We are not going to buy from them what we make ourselves.''
   Frans Andriessen, the community's top trade official, conceded
that some of the guarantees adopted by the ministers ``will not
make it easier to negotiate, but at least we are in a position to
start.''
   Agriculture is one of 15 areas under discussion in the world
trade negotiations, which began in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of
Punta del Este.
   The final week of bargaining, which is to end the round, opens
Dec. 3 in Brussels.
   The United States is among nations insisting, however, that
agriculture holds the key to liberalizing trade in other areas,
including textiles, manufactured goods and services, such as
telecommunications and banking. Argentina threatened to walk out of
the round if deep cuts are not made in farm subsidies.

   An Election Day storm dumped heavy snow on the Rockies and left
highways slippery on the western Plains, and snow over the Great
Lakes closed some Michigan schools.
   ``In some counties we've had trouble even getting poll workers
to the polls to open them up,'' said Nebraska Secretary of State
Allen Beermann.
   High wind knocked out power to thousands of customers in upstate
New York, and heavy rain soaked parts of New England.
   Heavy snow fell across parts of Wyoming from late Monday into
Tuesday. Snowfall totals ranged up to 17 inches at Sinks Canyon, 7
miles southwest of Lander; 13 inches at Lander; 12 inches at
Togwotee Pass, 40 miles northeast of Jackson; and up to a foot at
Casper. Casper Mountain got nearly 3 feet of snow in a 30-hour
period, the National Weather Service said.
   In Colorado, the National Weather Service said snow increased in
coverage and intensity in Denver and other Front Range areas during
the morning rush hour. The snow was driven by wind blowing at 15 to
25 mph, cutting visibility.
   Colorado ski resorts benefited from the storm, with Winter Park
getting up to 10 inches on Monday and Steamboat Springs 8 inches.
Meteorologists said accumulations of 6 to 12 inches were possible
in Colorado's northern and central mountains.
   Freezing drizzle iced roads near the Colorado-Kansas line.
   Western and north-central Nebraska was hit by snow, rain, wind
and cold and many voters needed chains on their car tires just to
get to the polls.
   Most of western Nebraska was covered with 2 to 3 inches of snow,
with reports of up to 5 inches on the ground in Kimball and 7
inches at O'Neill, said Larry Wirth of the weather service office
in Scottsbluff. Twelve inches fell at Greeley in the north-central
part of the state, the weather service said.
   ``It's snowing some and the wind is blowing and it's cold and
icy,'' said Lincoln County Clerk Nadine Heath at midmorning. ``I
understand in the rural areas it's really hard to see.''
   Another storm dumped up to 8 inches of snow on Michigan's
northern Lower Peninsula and caused scattered power outages from
Monday into early Tuesday.
   State police said snow forced the closing of at least four
northern Lower Peninsula school districts.
   A state police dispatcher at Alpena reported several minor
traffic accidents.
   ``It's still snowing and blowing and it's probably 7 or 8 inches
deep close to town and as you go out from the town it gets a little
deeper,'' dispatcher George Beebe said early Tuesday. ``A pretty
good percentage of the city is without power.''
   Just four days earlier, Michigan had a spell of Indian summer,
making the storm hard to take, said hairdresser Michelle Collins in
Houghton Lake.
   ``I wasn't expecting it. We had such a nice week,'' she said.
``From what the customers are saying coming in, it's pretty bad, a
lot of sleet, a lot of cars in ditches.''
   Wind gusting to more than 60 mph whipped through upstate New
York on Tuesday, downing trees and power lines. A peak gust of 63
mph was recorded at Buffalo, the weather service said.
   In Monroe County, N.Y., where wind was recorded at 59 mph,
officials reported numerous power outages and trees falling on cars
and houses. No injuries were reported.
   About a third of a church under construction in Pittsford
collapsed but no one was there at the time.
   At least 20,000 homes lost power from southern New York state to
Niagara Falls. All but a few hundred had been restored by noon,
said E. Alfred Osborne, a spokesman for Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
   Wind-whipped waves reached 8 feet on Lake Erie and 10 feet or
higher on Lake Ontario. Minor flooding was reported along the Lake
Erie shoreline south of Buffalo.
   High wind also buffeted parts of Maine, along with heavy rain.
Cape Elizabeth and the Portland area were lashed with wind
averaging 30 mph and gusts as high as 45 mph.
   ``A big storm developed very suddenly along the coast,'' said
Art Lester, a weather service meteorologist. ``The rain was very
heavy.''
   Southern New Hampshire also had pounding rain that cut into
morning voter turnout.

   Truffles, the ugly fungi prized as a
delicacy by gourmands, have been tainted by a fraud scandal.
   Authorities on Tuesday said four companies that handle the bulk
of truffle sales in France have been implicated in a scheme to
defraud wholesale buyers.
   The culprits allegedly used walnut juice to stain light-colored
summer truffles so they appeared to be the more coveted and more
expensive dark winter truffles.
   The case has been turned over to prosecutors in the southern
town of Carpentras after an investigation by a government consumer
fraud agency.
   Summer truffles sell for about $36 per pound, compared to $164
per pound for winter truffles. The fraud allegedly involved several
tons of truffles.
   Truffles grow just under the surface of the soil. They can be
found by a person using a stick, but more commonly pigs or trained
hounds are used to sniff them out.

   United Press International laid off more
emloyees Tuesday, a day after company officials said the news
service faced liquidation unless remaining workers accepted a
90-day pay cut of 35 percent.
   ``There have been some further dismissals in various departments
of UPI,'' said spokesman Milt Capps. ``They were in various places
throughout the system. These dismissals have been effected over the
past couple of weeks, some of those as late as today.''
   He declined to give numbers.
   UPI officials on Monday said the 83-year-old news service will
have to be liquidated Nov. 16 unless employees represented by the
Wire Service Guild accept 90-day salary cuts. Managers and other
non-guild workers already have been told they must accept similar
cuts.
   Company officials said pay concessions by the union-covered
employees would provide the news service more time to seek a buyer,
although Pieter Vanbennekom, UPI executive vice president,
cautioned that approval of the pay cut would not ``guarantee UPI
will be successfully sold.''
   Capps said the company normally does not reveal plans for
layoffs in advance but also said, ``We do not anticipate many, if
any, such moves during the balance of this interim plan that we
have.''
   UPI has changed ownership three times in the past eight years.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of high school students around
France poured into the streets Tuesday, a day after 130,000 youths
joined nationwide marches to demand better education and improved
security on campus.
   The largest protests Tuesday involved 8,000 students in
Besancon, 6,000 in Toulouse, and 4,000 each in Reims and Vannes,
police reported. There were smaller marches in Marseille, Nancy,
Metz, Belfort, Dijon, Nevers and Mulhouse.
   No violence or arrests were reported, although a police officer
directing traffic away from the march in Marseille suffered minor
injuries when accidentally struck by a car.
   Two police unions representing 35 percent of the uniformed
officers denounced orders issued to riot police Monday in Paris to
avoid confrontations with protesters.
   Scores of youths went on a rampage along the march route,
wrecking businesses and hurling projectiles that injured 13 people,
including five policemen. Police made several arrests, but
generally avoided using force.
   One union statement said policemen were ``scandalized by the
passive attitude of public officials,'' and warned that
troublemakers would be encouraged to take advantage of police
restraint.
   ``It's unacceptable that those in charge of the security of
citizens, including the demonstrators, should transform the police
into mere bystanders,'' said another union statement.
   Protests have spread nationwide since starting three weeks ago
in the low-income suburbs north of Paris, where a student was raped
in a school lavatory and several teachers and students were
assaulted.
   The students are demanding more teachers, repairs to crumbling
high schools and more security guards on crime-ridden campuses in
ghetto neighborhoods.
   Students around the country marched Monday as the National
Assembly debated the Socialist government's proposal to increase
education spending by 9 percent, to the equivalent of $49 billion.
Student leaders have criticized this as inadequate, although it
outpaces the overall budget increase of 4.8 percent.
   Education Minister Lionel Jospin managed to have Assembly debate
delayed until next week while he pursues dialogue with the student
movement, which is split into moderate and hard-line leftist
factions.
   Conservative opposition parties proposed Tuesday that the
Socialist government sell off state-owned industries to finance
school renovations.

<HEAD>Kuwait Says Jordan Breaking Sanctions, Asks Halt</HEAD>

   Kuwait accused Jordan on Tuesday of
breaking U.N. sanctions by trucking food across its border into
Iraq and asked it to stop.
   Mohammad Abu Al-Hassan, Kuwait's ambassador to the United
Nations, warned Jordan it could face the same sanctions as Iraq if
it failed to halt shipments of forbidden goods.
   He told a news conference that sanctions are not working mainly
because the Iraqi government does not care ``for the suffering of
its own people'' and is diverting all food and equipment to the
army.
   ``Whatever Iraq has now is sufficient to run the army for quite
a long time,'' he said.
   The U.N. Security Council is considering new resolutions,
including one that would impose economic sanctions on countries
breaking sanctions on Iraq, Hassan said.
   Kuwaiti refugees have reported seeing Jordanian trucks loaded
with food all over the captured emirate.
   The ambassador said humanitarian food shipments are not barred,
but a mechanism exists for determining what food is being sent on a
humanitarian basis.
   ``This mechanism has not been followed by Jordan in their
supplying of food to Iraq. Therefore, whatever food is supplied to
Iraq, it is in violation of Security Council Resolution 661,''
which authorized sanctions, Hassan said.
   Asked if other countries were violating the sanctions, he said
there were ``some violations'' by Yemen shortly after the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and there has been some smuggling from
Iran that is not condoned by the Iranian government.
   He said the number of Kuwaitis fleeing their homeland was 300 to
350 on Monday and is increasing because of Iraqi ``atrocities'' and
because the Iraqis are giving food and gasoline only to Iraqi
citizens.
   No Kuwaiti wants to become an Iraqi, he said.
   The ambassador said Kuwaiti students are undergoing military
training in the United States, Britain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf states because they want to participate ``in the honor
of liberating their country.''
   He said he had no exact figures on how many were being trained.

   Americans held at strategic targets in Iraq
will be able to send messages and receive care packages under an
agreement announced Tuesday by the Red Cross.
   The first phase of the program involves message exchanges
between the 106 hostages and their families, said Stephen Richards,
the Red Cross' executive vice president.
   After a cycle of messages has been completed, the Red Cross,
working with its sister organization, the Iraqi Red Crescent, will
arrange for the shipment of packages including such items as drugs,
food, clothing, paperback books and toiletries.
   Some hostages and their families have been able to communicate
through letters shipped in and out of Iraq by the State Department,
which is serving as a clearing house. In addition, Iraq has allowed
a few hostages to telephone home.
   The Red Cross agreement only covers the men at strategic sites,
not all the Americans held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait,
he said.
   Richards, who just returned from Baghdad, said the Red Cross is
also seeking permission to have a medical team visit the hostages
to check on their physical and mental condition.
   The Red Cross, a neutral agency, has not been involved in
efforts to gain the release of the hostages, which Richards called
a governmental responsibility.
   The United States has demanded the hostages' unconditional
release.
   Representatives of the Iraqi Red Crescent say the hostages are
faring adequately, Richards said.
   ``They felt their general health and nutrition were
satisfactory,'' he said. But ``their psychological well-being would
be substantially improved were they able to send regular messages
to and from their families.''
   The State Department welcomed the Red Cross' agreement, saying
it would make the hostages' lives easier.
   On Monday, department spokesman Richard Boucher said reports
from Iraq are that many detainees are losing weight, eating poorly
and are frequently cold as the winter approaches.
   Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La., said her husband, Donald, is
``doing alright. ... He is getting food even though what he gets is
the same old thing.''
   Mrs. Whatley has received several letters from her husband who
is kept at a strategic site near Baghdad. The State Department has
passed 408 letters to hostages and has received 269 back for their
friends and family.
   ``He is optimistic that he is going to come home,'' Mrs. Whatley
said of her husband.
   The Red Cross message exchange program is expected to get under
way in about 10 days. Each cycle will take about two weeks.
   The hostages will be handed short forms to write messages. Those
will be shipped to the United States, through Jordan, by the Red
Cross.
   Then, the family members will be allowed to write responses,
which in turn will be delivered to the hostages. The Iraqi Red
Crescent officials will serve as the couriers inside Iraq.

   From his native Brooklyn to the rock-strewn
hills of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Rabbi Meir Kahane preached
a violent doctrine of Jewish power.
   In New York he railed at blacks, and in Israel he advocated the
mass expulsion of the Palestinians. On Monday in New York, at age
58, he was slain by an assassin police said was believed to be of
Arab descent.
   Kahane, who founded the Jewish Defense League in New York, was
both revered and reviled in Israel. The establishment, both liberal
and conservative, shunned him as a racist. But his small band of
followers worshiped him.
   ``A prophet has died,'' Kahane aide Herbert Sunshine said at the
Jerusalem headquarters of the rabbi's anti-Arab Kach movement.
   ``Kahane was an advocate of racial discrimination and
apartheid,'' said Palestinian Saeed Kanan. ``He became a victim of
his own slogans and mottos.''
   The bearded, black-haired rabbi made his name with brutal,
hot-tempered rhetoric.
   American blacks were guilty of Jew hatred, he said. Arabs were
dogs. Jews who ignored this were lemmings. Another Holocaust was
imminent, he declared, and made his symbol a clenched fist under
the slogan ``Never again.''
   Although a relatively small number of Israelis supported Kahane
in elections, in private conversations many would agree with his
views. His message of Jewish force struck a sympathetic chord in
the country founded largely in response to the Holocaust and
surrounded by Arab enemies. Even a recent poll conducted among
Soviet immigrants who just arrived in Israel showed that 9.8
percent of them were ready to vote for Kahane.
   Asked how he would expel Arabs from Israel, he replied:
``Picture Arabs putting on the radio one morning and hearing the
new minister of defense is Meir Kahane. ... When they hear that,
they'll pack themselves.''
   The notion of becoming Israel's defense minister was pure
fantasy. In three runs for election, he got into Israel's
Parliament only once, by himself, and was finally barred from
running in 1988 because of his blunt anti-Arab racism.
   Kahane founded the militant Jewish Defense League to protect
elderly Jews against muggers, but it was later accused of planting
bombs in a terrorist campaign against Arabs and Soviets.
   He was born Martin David Kahane on Aug. 1, 1932, the son of a
rabbi in Brooklyn's Flatbush section, and took the Hebrew name Meir
when he became a rabbi.
   He grew up during Judaism's most dreadful years. The full
horrors of the Nazi Holocaust were becoming known, and a relative
was shot to death by Arabs in Palestine.
   At 15, Kahane was arrested for throwing tomatoes at British
Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin, a foe of Jewish statehood. It was
the first of his many arrests in the United States and Israel.
   ``Kahane represented the undissipated anger at the Holocaust.
There was no way that his anger and his fury could actually be
expressed except through this way of seeing the Jews as either
vulnerable or fighting,'' commented Zev Chafits, an American-born
Israeli writer.
   In 1957, he won a law degree and an master's degree in
international relations, and was ordained a rabbi. But he lost his
first rabbinical post for enforcing Orthodox Jewish law too
strictly on his Queens congregation.
   He became a sportswriter, went to Israel in 1962, and left
defeated, mocked for his arrogance and his stuttering efforts to
learn Hebrew.
   Journalist Robert I. Friedman, wrote in the biography ``The
False Prophet'' that Kahane became an FBI informer, infiltrating
radical groups such as the John Birch Society even as he cruised
New York's East Side bars.
   Friedman says that in 1966 a fashion model named Estelle Donna
Evans jumped from a bridge and died after Kahane, married with four
children, broke off their affair.
   The New York Times did an expose on the sensational aspects of
Kahane's career in 1971. At that time he was leading the Jewish
Defense League, heading marches against black politicians and white
liberals, whom he accused of pandering to blacks.
   Kahane soon widened his attacks to include the Soviet Union for
its treatment of Jews. Right-wing Israeli politician Geula Cohen
says she urged him to take up the cudgel against the Soviets, and
Friedman says that Yitzhak Shamir, now Israel's prime minister,
also encouraged Kahane's anti-Soviet radicalism.
   Kahane moved to Israel in 1971, to a circumspect welcome from
the right wing. Mrs. Cohen says she told him ``that here we have
the Israeli army, and we don't need you to deal with the Arabs.''
   On the one hand, he was ``a foreign implantation, he didn't
acclimatize, he didn't have roots in the political Zionist sense.
He didn't fit in,'' Mrs. Cohen said.
   On the other hand, Kahane articulated the gut feelings many
Israelis fear to say aloud: fear of the Arabs, a sense of
isolation, a yearning for quick, clearcut solutions.
   Kahane's message - the one that got him elected in 1984 - seemed
simple enough to some: ``I want to remove the Arabs - including
Israeli Arabs - from the entire land of Israel.''
   This meant expelling not only the 1.7 million Palestinians, but
Israel's 800,000 Arab citizens.
   This, plus the Kach movement's thuggish tactics, proved too much
even for the hard-liners. In 1988, Kahane's candidacy was
disqualified under a specially enacted law against advocating
racism.
   The rabbi took his anti-Arab campaign to the streets. An attack
against Jews would bring out his followers, carrying Kahane on
their shoulders and shouting ``Death to the Arabs!''
   Thousands would join his hard-core supporters at Kach marches,
either out of conviction or curiosity.
   During such a march - in July 1989, after a Palestinian killed
16 Jews by steering a bus off a highway - Kahane had his final
run-in with Israel's establishment.
   For calling Arabs ``a cancer spreading in our midst,'' he was
arrested and charged with sedition. At his death, the case still
awaited a decision in the courts.

   The White House held up an announcement about
a proposed historic site in Vancouver, Wash., to hurt the
re-election chances of Democratic Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, her campaign
charged Tuesday.
   Unsoeld, a freshman Democrat targeted for defeat by the
Republicans, won passage of the measure before Congress adjourned
late last month.
   The White House press office finally confirmed at 5 p.m. EST
Tuesday that the president had signed the measure.
   Unsoeld's campaign was upset by the failure of the White House
to announce whether President Bush had signed or vetoed legislation
that would have authorized an 18-month study of a proposed historic
reserve chronicling the birthplace of the Pacific Northwest.
   ``We suspected they would hold it to the last minute, but
holding it past the deadline is a little ridiculous. This appears
patently political,'' said Dan Evans, Unsoeld's chief of staff.
   ``The practical effect of their non-announcement is to deny
Jolene an accomplishment story,'' Evans said.
   David Kalbaugh, assistant to the executive clerk in the White
House Executive Clerk's Office, confirmed Tuesday that Bush's
deadline for signing the bill expired at 12:01 a.m.
   ``Unfortunately due to the president's travel there has been no
announcement,'' Kalbaugh said. ``When the president returns, there
will be some sort of announcement from the White House press
office.''
   Bush returned to the White House Tuesday afternoon.
   Evans said the bill had been on the president's desk since Oct.
24.
   The bill will launch an 18-month study into the feasibility of
creating a 300-acre Fort Vancouver National Historical Reserve on
the banks of the Columbia River across from Portland, Ore.
   Vancouver and surrounding Clark County were viewed as a critical
election battleground by both Unsoeld and Republican Bob Williams.
   The study calls for a five-member commission to report to
Congress by 1992 with recommendations on establishing the reserve
under management of the National Park Service.
   The Park Service already operates a wooden replica of Fort
Vancouver, home to the original Hudson's Bay Company trading post,
on the site.
   The study would determine whether to add the Vancouver Barracks,
the newly restored officers row, the Columbia River waterfront and
the Pearson Airpark, the oldest continually operating airport in
the nation.

   Behind the flags and bunting and mechanized curtains, in schools
and churches and government buildings, Americans voted on Tuesday.
Then, time and again, they declared disgust with the government
they were electing.
   ``You have to kind of hold your nose and vote this time,'' said
John Kirley, a semi-retired consultant voting in Dallas. His
sentiments were widely shared by voters around the country.
   From outward appearances, the election was another page from a
civics textbook. Voters streamed into a Mennonite church gymnasium
in Fresno, Calif., a recreation center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., a
housing project lobby in Minneapolis, a school cafeteria in New
York City.
   They punched computer cards and pulled old-fashioned cranks.
They participated in democracy.
   But beneath the surface ran a disturbing streak of cynicism -
about the federal budget, about the U.S. involvement in the Persian
Gulf and, perhaps most sharply, about the dismal state of political
campaigns.
   In northern Michigan's rural Benzie County, people filed into
the Benzonia Township Hall to cast their ballots, exchange some
small talk and sample Township Clerk Pat Mead's orange twists and
sticky buns.
   Precinct worker Art Fleetwood kept up a running banter about
Monday night's snow and this fall's bow hunting season for deer -
anything but politics.
   But when talk did turn to politics, the people of Benzie County
were as disgusted as voters anywhere.
   ``Kick them all out!'' one man said as he walked out the door.
   ``Start over!'' his wife chimed in.
   Family physician Bob Camp looked over the sample ballot posted
on the wall.
   ``If there was a place on here for `No one,' I would have voted
a straight ticket,'' he said. ``I am thoroughly disgusted. I am
more than that. I am one step beyond disgusted.''
   Six hundred miles away, in New York City, wind blew leaves into
swirls outside the brick school building where 5-year-old Emma
Rosenberg had just voted for the first time, with some help from
her mother, Debbie.
   ``She voted for the environment,'' said Debbie Rosenberg, who
had let Emma pull the lever for a vote on New York's Environmental
Quality Bond Act.
   It was thrilling for a 5-year-old, but her mother's smile
vanished when she was asked if she was satisfied with the slate of
candidates on the ballot.
   ``No, who's satisfied?'' she said. ``Nobody's satisfied right
now.''
   A few minutes later, precinct worker Tousette G. Sefman stepped
outside for a cigarette. As a black woman, she said, she felt
especially obligated to exercise her right to vote. But she, too,
was disgusted with her government.
   ``I think maybe a parliamentary system might be better,'' Ms.
Sefman said.
   Turnout was heavy as usual at the Cape Canaveral Recreation
Center, where nearly half the voters are retired. Many of the
others are employed at the Kennedy Space Center or its offshoots in
the aerospace industry.
   The common theme: Throw the bums out.
   ``There's nothing right today, from the banks to the S&amp;Ls to the
war to the budget,'' grumbled real estate agent John Jones, 54.
``I'm going to do what I can to change it.''
   Jones said he voted against the incumbents. ``It's the first
time in my life I ever felt so strongly about it,'' he said.
   In Braintree, Mass., Dr. Earl Hoerner voted against the entire
Democratic state ticket, which was heavily laden with incumbents.
   ``Throw the guys out,'' he said as he left his polling booth.
   Further up the Atlantic coast at Cape Elizabeth, Maine, the mood
of the voters was as foul as the weather. Rain fell in wind-driven
sheets outside Cape Elizabeth High School where equipment operator
Skip Ingalls voted.
   ``I watched the news last night and they described the NOTA -
None of the Above,'' Ingalls said. ``That's how I feel like voting
in several instances.''
   These are the people who bothered to vote. For every one of
them, there was at least one other qualified citizen who abandoned
that right.
   And there were a few rays of sunshine - voters who still
believed, or who were too young to be jaded.
   At Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., students trickled
into a polling station set up in the lobby of a lab building. There
were no signs of disillusionment among these voters, still fresh to
the power they wield in a democracy.
   ``I haven't lost faith yet,'' said Les Bergsman, 21, in his
third year as a voting adult.
   Campus billboards were pasted with fliers proclaiming, ``Don't
Vote: Revolt!'' The fliers declared that ``voting is a form of
social suicide'' and urged a sort of militant apathy to show
contempt for a corrupt government.
   Bergsman wasn't buying it. Government has its problems, he said,
but that is what voting is for. ``You do what you can to un-corrupt
it,'' Bergsman said. ``By not voting you support a corrupt system.
You leave it in the hands of those corrupt.''

   Democrats bid Tuesday to fortify their majorities in Congress
and challenged Republican control of four key governorships,
highlights of a midterm election punctuated by the autumn stirrings
of voter discontent.
   Voters were still in line at the polling places in many states
as the first returns came in. They showed Republican Sen. Dan Coats
leading in Indiana and Sen. Mitch McConnell ahead in Kentucky - a
race where Democrats had harbored hopes of an upset.
   With 34 Senate races on the ballot, Democrats took aim at
Republican incumbents Jesse Helms in North Carolina, Mark Hatfield
in Oregon and Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota in hopes of padding their
current 55-45 majority.
   The House of Representatives was securely in Democratic control,
as it has been since the Eisenhower era. All 435 seats were on the
ballot, although most attention clustered around 29 races without
an incumbent, 18 of them currently in Republican hands.
   Among 36 statehouse races, Republican governorships in
California, Texas, Florida and Illinois were at risk, probably the
biggest prizes of the year. The GOP hoped for victories that would
protect their influence in drawing boundaries for House seats that
will shift to the Sun Belt in 1992.
   Republicans vied to take over Democratic statehouses in
Massachusetts and Ohio.

   President Zhelyu Zhelev appealed for calm
Tuesday but students ignored his pleas to end a strike and workers
threatened to cut off the gasoline supply if Bulgaria's government
did not resign.
   Finance Minister Belcho Belchev meanwhile said economic woes
could topple the government of former Communists, now members of
the renamed Bulgarian Socialist Party.
   Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov has had his hands tied by
Parliament, which refuses to back his economic reforms. Last week,
he said he would resign if the 400-seat legislature did not approve
his program. His Socialists hold 211 seats, and the main opposition
group 144.
   The 10,000 workers at Bulgaria's main petrochemical plant
threatened to strike Thursday if Lukanov does not quit, the state
BTA news agency reported.
   The strike at Bourgas would halt the flow of already rationed
gasoline and paralyze the country.
   Lukanov said after meeting plant management that the government
would use ``all legal measures'' to ensure continued flow of fuel
supplies, BTA said.
   In a statement carried by the news agency, the government said
it would not yield to ultimatums but was open to dialogue.
   Belchev said price rises were imminent, but that meager supplies
were unlikely to improve, BTA said. ``That will be the end of the
government,'' it quoted him as saying.
   Zhelev, the former opposition leader, appealed to students who
occupied Sofia University on Monday to end their sit-in strike, his
spokesman, Valentin Stoyanov, said on state radio. The students
refused.
   BTA said students also occupied the technical university in the
pollution-plagued city of Ruse on the Romanian border and the
medical academy in Sofia.
   It was not clear how many students were participating. They are
demanding the Socialists accept blame for past Communist mistakes
and responsibility for the current crisis.
   Stoyanov said the students' ``legitimate'' demands must be
achieved ``with legitimate means.''
   ``Such actions do not help the democratic process in Bulgaria,
but destroy it because they create social tensions and unwarranted
mistrust between the political forces,'' Stoyanov quoted Zhelev as
saying.
   ``As the political forces are carrying out consultations on the
formation of a new government, it is very important that the
citizens maintain peace and calm in the country.''
   The Socialists reiterated Tuesday they back a coalition
government. But Vice Chairman Alexander Tomov said it must
``reflect the realities in Parliament.''
   Lukanov heads an all-Socialist government because the main
opposition alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces, refused to
govern with the former Communists.
   On Monday, UDF's floor leader in Parliament, Stoyan Ganev, said
his 17-party alliance wanted to form a UDF-dominated government
with the opposition holding the prime minister's office and key
ministries.

   An experimental program that ties welfare
benefits to teen-agers' school attendance has resumed after a judge
lifted an order suspending it because poor attendance records
caused unfair penalties.
   ``We think it will be a better program and we're upbeat,'' said
David Blaska, a spokesman with the state Department of Health and
Human Services, which oversees the Learnfare program.
   Blaska added that the state would pursue an expansion of the
program to younger children.
   Learnfare, which docks the welfare benefits of families whose
teen-agers skip school, was suspended in Milwaukee County during
the summer. The court order suspending the program applied only to
Milwaukee County, where the bulk of the program is carried out.
   U.S. District Judge Terence Evans last week lifted the
suspension he had earlier imposed after state and Milwaukee school
officials reached an agreement to ensure better attendance records
would be kept.
   The agreement includes the assignment of 16 workers to verify
attendance of truants before penalties are imposed.
   ``Milwaukee is where the action is, where so much is needed and
the program is part of it,'' Blaska said. ``Getting the injunction
lifted is a lift to our spirits.''
   The program's supporters claim Learnfare discourages truancy and
will help break the cycle of poverty. Critics say the experiment
penalizes the poor.
   Among the safeguards state and school officials have added is a
verification process that includes notices to all parents. Thy are
told their children's attendance is being monitored and that
truancy can result in cuts in Aid to Families with Dependent
Children benefits.
   Families will also be contacted by case managers to make sure
the student is actually enrolled and to set up interviews to
explain the sanctions before any penalties are imposed.
   Other provisions include $750,000 in new state funds to create
alternative education programs for Milwaukee school dropouts.
   ``I think it's a monumental step toward remedying the situation
of inaccurate information,'' said Willie Little, director of
community relations for Milwaukee Public Schools.
   More than 13,000 Milwaukee County teen-agers are subject to
potential sanctions. Families of about 12 percent of the students
had their payments docked in June, the month before the program was
suspended.
   The program resumed immediately after the judge's ruling, but
welfare benefits for violators won't be cut until February to allow
time for the changes to be implemented, Blaska said.
   State officials said they would pursue an expansion that would
allow them to apply the sanctions to welfare families with children
between ages 6 and 12.
   The expansion would cost about $4 million a year and increase
the number of students monitored statewide from 27,000 to 70,000,
Blaska said. The earliest it could be instituted is late 1991, he
said.
   The federal government has already granted the state permission
to expand the program to elementary students and the Wisconsin
Legislature is expected to consider it in January.
   ``We hope to catch truancy before it becomes a chronic
problem,'' Blaska said. ``It's also easier to implement when the
child is younger and more amenable.''
   Under the proposed expansion, sanctions against families with
children between ages 6 and 12 would be more lenient. The families
of violators would not be penalized if they agreed instead to
attend regular counseling with case managers.
   Milwaukee Public Schools officials say they are uneasy about the
expansion and fear it may become an unnecessary administrative
headache since elementary schools have a 95 percent attendance
rate.
   ``We'd have to evaluate the current program before we decided if
we support the expansion of Learnfare,'' he said. ``If it's going
to get kids in school and keep them in school, then we would
absolutely support it.''

<HEAD>Council of Europe Admits Hungary</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Council of Europe on Tuesday admitted Hungary as
its first member from the former Communist East bloc.
   The council, known for its human rights achievements, is the
oldest post-World War II body promoting European cooperation.
   ``It is certainly a great day for me and for all Hungarians to
be admitted into Europe and the Council of Europe,'' Foreign
Minister Geza Jeszenszky of Hungary told a news conference in the
17th-century Barberini Palace in central Rome.
   He said membership in the Council of Europe ``is an additional
protection for the newborn democracy in Hungary.''
   Jeszenszky explained that if Hungary did not maintain high human
rights and democratic standards, it would be forced to leave the
41-year-old Council.
   He spoke hours after he and Council Secretary-General Catherine
Lalumiere signed documents admitting Hungary and committing it to
the council's human rights treaty.
   ``When the time came, Hungary was bold enough to open a hole in
the Iron Curtain,'' Ms. Lalumiere told council ministers gathered
around the table in the gilt-edged room.
   ``The leaders and indeed the people have contributed so much to
bringing the division of Europe to an end.''
   The ministers then watched on TV as the red, white and green
Hungarian flag was raised along the other 23 members' flags at the
Council of Europe offices in Strasbourg, France.
   Czechoslovakia and Poland are expected to join the Council of
Europe soon. Like Hungary, they made a dramatic, peaceful switch
from Communist dictatorship to democracy.
   The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have observer status
and Romania and Albania may become observers soon.
   Tuesday's signing came at the start of a daylong meeting by
Council of Europe foreign ministers.
   During the session, they invited the Soviet Union to sign the
council's treaty on cultural exchanges. They also condemned Iraq's
detention of hundreds of foreigners since its invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   In a statement, the ministers ``agreed that unity of action
would present the best chances for the unconditional release of all
the hostages.'' The declaration was an implicit criticism of
European politicians who have traveled to Baghdad to win freedom
for their fellow citizens.
   The Council of Europe has produced 130 international treaties.
It is best known for the European Human Rights Convention and
European Court of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding on
council members.
   Hungary applied for council membership a year ago, when reform
Communists were still in power. A government dominated by the
center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum was formed last summer
after the first free multiparty elections in four decades.
   The council is seeking to increase its influence in human rights
issues and possibly develop a parliament bringing together the
United States, Europe and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Nighttime Curfew Ordered in Black Township</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The law and order minister
imposed a nighttime curfew Tuesday in the black township of
Bekkersdal, where violence sparked by students protesting school
conditions has killed up to 25 people.
   The 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew confined thousands of blacks to their
homes, and police were given wider powers to control disturbances.
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said the extra security
measures were necessary following destruction of property and
violence that began Thursday. He did not say how long the curfew
would be in effect.
   One of those 25 people to have died in Bekkersdal, outside
Johannesburg, occurred Monday when a man was shot by soldiers.
Police said the troops opened fire when the man came at them with a
knife.
   Most of the deaths are believed linked to a feud between student
groups who disagree on whether to boycott year-end standardized
school exams. Many black students demand boycotts of the tests to
protest conditions in black schools. Police say the violence began
when those students tried to prevent others from taking the tests.
   Schools have been empty this week, many workers have stayed
home, businesses have been closed and some families have fled the
area in search of safety.
   Police patrolled the township Tuesday following clashes the
previous day that left seven people injured and houses in flames.
Authorities said they confiscated two AK-47 assault rifles from the
house of a man who belongs to the Pan Africanist Congress, a black
opposition group. No new violence was reported Tuesday, and police
did not have a breakdown for which days the deaths had occurred.
   The year-end school tests determine whether students advance to
the next grade or gain admission to universities. Last year, 42
percent of black high school seniors nationwide passed the final
exam, compared to a pass rate of more than 95 percent for white
students. Many blacks blame the disparity on the white-led
government, which spends about five times as much to educate a
white pupil as a black pupil.
   More than 800 blacks have died since August in factional
fighting in the black townships around Johannesburg. Most of the
battles have been between supporters of the African National
Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party, the two largest black
opposition groups.

   Iraq on Tuesday promised to free 108 hostages, none of them
American, and insisted anew its foreign ``guests'' are
well-treated. Secretary of State James A. Baker III pressed U.S.
allies about their willingness to go to war.
   The Baghdad government was keeping an eye on Tuesday's midterm
elections in the United States. It claimed any slippage in
Republican support would reflect a lack of public support for
President Bush's Persian Gulf policies.
   ``The American people will ... ask him why he is sending their
sons to be killed in the Arab desert and he will reap the fruits of
his mistake,'' said Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jassim.
   In the latest hostage releases, Iraq's official news agency said
77 Japanese nationals would be freed in response to an appeal from
former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. It also said 20
Italians, five Swedes, two Germans, two Portuguese and two
Australians would be allowed to leave.
   It did not say when the captives would be freed, but some had
already begun to assemble at a Baghdad hotel.
   They were among thousands of foreigners trapped when Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Some had been held at strategic sites as
``human shields'' against attack.
   Iraq has since freed hundreds of captives, but Western
governments have expressed growing fears that Iraq's Saddam Hussein
is successfully using the hostages to divide the alliance facing
him.
   Baker, meanwhile, was seeking to strengthen the anti-Iraq
coalition. He is in the Mideast to assess support for stronger
steps against Iraq, including a possible military strike.
   He met Tuesday in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
but there was no immediate word on the outcome. Egypt has sent
thousands of troops to join the multinational force assembled in
the gulf.
   U.S. troops make up the bulk of the force, which numbers about
300,000. The Pentagon said Tuesday the U.S. troop deployment in the
region had reached 230,000 and was still growing.
   In a sign of the escalating U.S. military commitment, the Marine
Corps said it was calling up more than 600 reservists from eight
states for combat roles. Up until now, the more than 34,000
reservists called to active duty have served in support roles.
   While in Egypt, Baker also met with China's foreign minister,
Qian Qichen. China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, and its support would be needed for a U.N.-sanctioned
military strike against Saddam.
   Qian did not explicitly approve sending troops into action -
``we'll still have to wait and see,'' he said. But U.S. officials
said on condition of anonymity that his comments were an indication
at the very least the Beijing government would not veto a U.N.
resolution to authorize the use of force to liberate Kuwait.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who has tried to act as a mediator
in the gulf crisis, said prospects for peace are improving as the
world considers the consequences of an all-out conflict.
   ``War will be disastrous and catastrophic. This is the world's
oil center. Just imagine what a disaster and a catastrophe it will
be,'' Arafat told reporters in Baghdad.
   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, however, reminded Iraq on
Tuesday that the United Nations has not restricted the use of
military force to liberate Kuwait.
   ``We would like a peaceful settlement, but that option is in the
hands of the Iraqis,'' said the foreign minister, Prince Saud.
   Kuwait accused Jordan of breaking U.N. economic sanctions by
trucking food across the border into Iraq. Mohammad Abu Al-Hassan,
Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations, said at a news
conference in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that Jordan it could face the
same sanctions as Iraq if it failed to halt shipments of forbidden
goods.
   At the United Nations, four non-aligned members of the Security
Council drafted a plan calling for the simultaneous withdrawal of
Iraqi forces from Kuwait and foreign military forces from the
region. The measure, sponsored by Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia and
Yemen, was given little chance of passage.
   Iraq's freeing of its Japanese hostages comes as Japanese
lawmakers are considering a plan to send troops to the gulf in
non-combat roles. However, the measure has prompted strong protests
in Japan and its prospects for approval look dim. Japan said it had
not altered its gulf policy in order to win the hostages' freedom.
   Despite the European Community's disapproval of individual
hostage-freeing missions, such trips are becoming increasingly
common.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt met Tuesday in
Baghdad with German hostages, and was to meet Saddam on Wednesday.
Former Danish Prime Minister Anker Jorgensen arrived in Jordan and
planned to travel on to Iraq when he obtained a visa, and former
New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange was reported en route to the
gulf.
   Last weekend, Belgium's foreign minister, Mark Eyskens,
criticized ``Western pilgrims'' for courting Saddam in an effort to
free their citizens.
   Iraq has been expressing fears that the United States will use
the hostages as a reason for a military strike. On Tuesday, it
offered its latest assurances that the ``guests,'' as it calls the
captives, are being well treated.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentifed Trade
Ministry spokesman as saying the detained foreigners held ``are
receiving the same (supplies) as Iraqis.''
   A day earlier, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher had
said reports indicated many detainees were losing weight and eating
poorly.
   Also, the Red Cross said Iraqi officials have agreed to allow
Americans held at strategic sites to send messages home to their
families.

   A strong earthquake struck west of the
Aleutian Islands on Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of
injuries or damage.
   The quake, which hit at 11:14 a.m., measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale, said Bob Hammond of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in
Palmer.
   It was centered about 150 miles west of Attu Island, about 1,250
miles southwest of Anchorage.
   The earthquake was felt at Shemya Air Force Base, near Attu in
the sparsely populated Aleutian chain, but was not large enough to
generate a tidal wave, also called a tsunami, officials said.
   Moderate to strong earthquakes are commonplace throughout
Alaska.
   The 1964 Good Friday earthquake, centered in Prince William
Sound, measured 8.5 on the Richter scale. It generated large waves
that devasted several coastal communities, and killed 114 people as
far south as Oregon and Hawaii.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 6 on Richter scale can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Ex-Governor of Rhodesia, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, Dead at 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former governor of Rhodesia, Sir
Humphrey Gibbs, who vigorously opposed the white minority
government's declaration of independence, has died, his family said
Tuesday. He was 87.
   Gibbs died Monday from influenza complications, family members
said.
   Gibbs, born in London, settled in the former British colony as a
farmer in 1928.
   Appointed governor by Queen Elizabeth II in 1959, he served for
10 years, the last four as a recluse in Government House after he
tried unsuccessfully to fire the Cabinet of Prime Minister Ian D.
Smith over the independence rebellion against the British Crown.
   Gibbs steadfastly supported Britain's contention that the 1965
declaration to entrench white rule was illegal.
   Smith retaliated by appointing his own representative to the
Queen, ordered the media to stop referring to Gibbs as governor and
cut off electricity, water and telephones to Government House.
   But Smith did not eject the defiant governor, evidently fearing
retribution from Britain if the rebellion failed.
   The Cabinet, meanwhile, continued to pledge loyalty to the
British monarch until 1969, when it decided to transform Rhodesia
into a republic.
   Gibbs resigned his post, returned briefly to a hero's welcome in
Britain and then retired to his 6,500-acre farm in Rhodesia where
he lived alone.
   Smith's so-called officer administering the government, Clifford
Dupont, moved into Government House but was never recognized by the
British government or the Queen.
   Gibbs was a guest of honor when Robert Mugabe led Rhodesia to
independence as Zimbabwe in 1980 after waging a seven-year
guerrilla war.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete and a list of survivors was
not immediately available.

<HEAD>Britain's Thatcher Moves Up Date for Party Leadership Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday moved
forward the annual vote for her Conservative Party's leadership,
giving her foes only eight days to mount a challenge to displace
her as prime minister.
   The sudden resignation Thursday of Deputy Prime Minister Sir
Geoffrey Howe underlined divisions within the governing party and
prompted speculation that a challenger might try to oust Mrs.
Thatcher in the annual party election.
   The leader of the Conservatives - the party with the majority in
Parliament - automatically becomes prime minister. Under party
rules the leadership election could have been held as late as Dec.
5 - four weeks after the opening of Parliament.
   But Mrs. Thatcher on Tuesday approved Nov. 8 as the date of the
opening of nominations, Nov. 15 for the closing of nominations and
Nov. 20 as the election day, sharply reducing the time for a
challenge to be organized.
   Last year, a challenge by Sir Anthony Meyer, who was thought to
have no real chance to win, was the first since Mrs. Thatcher
became party leader in 1975. Meyer won 30 votes to Mrs. Thatcher's
314.
   Mrs. Thatcher must call the next general election by mid-1992.
   In Glasgow, Scotland, the Confederation of British Industry, the
main employers' organization, warned earlier Tuesday that the
embattled government risked losing power through divisions over
Britain's role in Europe.
   ``This conference has a message to our friends in the
government,'' director-general John Banham told the confederation's
annual meeting. ``... Before it is too late, remember what every
single person in this hall knows: a board that is divided is ripe
for takeover.''
   The Conservative Party is funded largely by big business,
including members of the confederation.
   Her robust rejection, at an Oct. 26 European Community summit,
of plans for political and economic union has split the Thatcher
government, which was already in deep economic trouble.
   Opinion polls indicate the government is 12 to 21 points behind
the opposition Labor Party, which is funded by labor unions and
feared by big business.
   Banham, whose organization reported last month that British
industry is now in recession, said failure to control inflation -
now running at 10.9 percent -was the major disappointment of the
1980s.
   The confederation supports the British government idea of a
European Community currency and the 12 currencies of member states
circulating simultaneously.
   The idea has been rejected by the 11 other EC countries that
agreed at the last summit to set up a single central bank by 1994
and possibly introduce one currency by 1997.
   ``We must be seen to be part of the new Europe,'' Banham said in
his keynote address. ``Isolation uld be a catastrophe for British
business.''

   Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell on
Tuesday defeated Democrat Theo Mitchell, who had sought to become
South Carolina's first black governor.
   Another South Carolina Republican, U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond,
turned back token opposition from Democrat Robert Cunningham, an
ex-CIA agent who apparently made no effort to campaign. Thurmond is
the nation's oldest and longest-serving member of Congress.
   With 1 percent of precincts reporting, Campbell had 1,777 votes,
or 67 percent, to 858 votes, or 33 percent, for Mitchell.
   With 1 percent of precincts reporting in the Senate race,
Thurmond had 1,818 votes, or 66 percent, to 929 votes, or 34
percent, for Cunningham.
   South Carolina's U.S. House delegation, with four Democrats and
two Republicans, all sought re-election. Four had opposition but
none of the challengers could dent the power of incumbency.
   Mitchell's campaign got little support from the state's
predominantly white Democratic leadership. Party officials
complained Mitchell, a state senator from Greenville, knew little
about running a statewide campaign.
   Mitchell lost a chance to debate Campbell when he lashed out at
black supporters of the governor by calling them ``house niggers,''
``Uncle Toms'' and ``black prostitutes.''
   Campbell and some Democrats called on Mitchell to apologize.
Mitchell refused, and Campbell declared he would not appear at the
debate.

   The Postal Service delivered about four-fifths
of overnight mail on time in its first test by an outside
consultant, a performance the postmaster general said Tuesday earns
the agency a ``low B.''
   Mail intended for overnight delivery arrived on time 80.61
percent of the time during a three-month test period that ended in
mid-September, the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse reported.
   ``About as low a B as you can get, that's how I would
characterize it,'' Postmaster General Anthony Frank said following
the monthly meeting of the service's board of governors.
   While the national rating was just over 80 percent, performance
varied widely from place to place with larger cities such as New
York ``dragging down'' the average.
   Overnight delivery of mail destined for the Big Apple was on
time just 46.94 percent of the time, the lowest share anywhere in
the 50 states.
   Top rated for overnight mail was Kansas City, Mo., with 94.06
percent of overnight mail arriving on time.
   In addition to the performance figures, Frank said that the
postal rate increase scheduled for next year, including a 30-cent
stamp, is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 3.
   While the recent budget settlement signed by President Bush will
cost the Postal Service $4.7 billion over five years, Frank said he
hopes not to have to raise rates again until 1994 or 1995.
   Previously he had said he did not expect another rate hike until
1996, but the cost of the budget settlement will mean ``more,
sooner'' as far as rates go, he said.
   Price Waterhouse conducted the delivery test by mailing 425,000
pieces of mail to 5,000 recipients in 286 ZIP codes across the
country. The mail included letters, post cards and large flat
envelopes, some with typed addresses and some hand written.
   In addition to the 80.61 percent performance for overnight mail,
74.38 percent of items intended for second day delivery arrived on
time, and mail designated for three-day service was on time 81.11
percent of the time.
   Overnight, second and three-day service depend on distance the
mail has to travel.
   A small share of mail took four, five or more days to arrive -
an outcome that clearly annoyed the postmaster general.
   ``Maybe you can make a case for being a day late ... but you
can't make one for being two, three or four days late,'' Frank
said, promising an attack on that problem area.
   The postal service's Southern region was tops in overnight
delivery at 84.02 percent on time, followed by the Eastern region
at 83.83 percent. The West finished third at 81.39 percent followed
by the Central region at 79.62 percent and the Northeast at 71.12
percent.

on time in major cities listed by the postal service:

<HEAD>Theologian Confesses to `Sin' of Apartheid Before Church Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading theologian from the
Dutch Reformed Church confessed to the sin of apartheid Tuesday, an
unusual public statement from a member of the church that long
supported the racist policy.
   The statement, made at a conference of South African church
leaders, was not an official church confession. But the theologian,
Willie Jonker, said he felt he could speak for himself as well as
the Dutch Reformed Church.
   Jonker went before conference delegates and said, ``I confess
before you and before the Lord, not only my sin and guilt and my
personal responsibility and structural wrongs that have been done
to many of you ... but vicariously I dare also to do that in the
name of the (Dutch Reformed Church) of which I am a member.''
   The Dutch Reformed Church is the main church of the Afrikaners,
the Dutch-descended whites who dominate the government. It has
branches for whites, blacks and people of mixed race and has been
isolated in South Africa for its support of segregation.
   The black and mixed-race branches oppose apartheid. The white
branch has backed off its argument of past decades that the Bible
supports apartheid, but it has not confessed to the sin of
apartheid. It also has not moved to merge with the other church
branches.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu accepted Jonker's confession.
``The confession is not cheaply made, and my response is not
cheaply made,'' he told applauding delegates.
   Nearly 300 delegates from about 90 churches are attending the
conference at Rustenburg, 62 miles northwest of Johannesburg. The
meeting has brought together churches long divided by apartheid
that now hope to reach agreement on the role of the church in a
future South Africa.
   Two small churches that support apartheid, the Afrikaans
Protestant Church and the Reformed Church, declined to attend.

   A day before his assassination, Rabbi Meir
Kahane said he feared he would be killed by a Jew, not an Arab, a
Miami radio host said Tuesday.
   Danny Tadmore had Kahane as a guest on his ``Voice of Israel''
program on radio station WVCG on Sunday. After an on-the-air
interview, Tadmore said he asked Kahane if he wasn't afraid to walk
around without bodyguards.
   ``He said, `I don't have a problem with the Arabs, I have a
problem with the Jews,''' Tadmore said. ```And if somebody's ever
going to kill me, it's going to be a Jew, not an Arab.'''
   ``Of course, he was wrong,'' Tadmore added. ``He was killed by
an Arab.''
   Kahane was shot to death in a New York hotel on Monday night.
Police identified the assailant as El-Sayyid A. Nosair, 35, an
Egyptian immigrant who took U.S. citizenship last year. Nosair, who
was shot in the neck, was in critical condition Tuesday night.
   Tadmore said Kahane was fatalistic about the possibility of
assassination.
   ``If you're a religious Jew, everything is preordained,''
Tadmore said. ``Let it come.''
   Tadmore said he interviewed Kahane about conditions in Israel
for an hour and 15 minutes, and afterward, Kahane hugged him ``and
he didn't let go, as if he knew something was coming.''

   The Justice Department on Tuesday appointed a
task force to improve management in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   The service was the subject of a highly critical department
audit in March 1989 that described the agency as overwhelmed by
sloppy accounting, poor management and the demands of recent
legislation.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of
Congress, also is looking into operations of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   A department announcement said Norman Carlson, who headed the
department's Bureau of Prisons for 17 years, would head the new
group. He will be joined by Tony Moscato, deputy assistant attorney
general for administration; Don Wortman, director of federal
programs for the National Academy of Public Administration and a
former executive with the Social Security Administration and the
Central Intelligence Agency, and others.
   ``With the passage of the landmark Immigration Act of 1990 it is
important that INS be in a stronger position to fulfill its new
mandate,'' Attorney General Dick thornburgh said in a statement.
   The congressional session just ended saw passage into law of a
bill establishing major increases in immigration quotas.

   The peacetime Army is a healthy alternative to
civilian life, say military researchers who found that soldiers in
1986 died at half the rate of their civilian counterparts.
   But one professor says choosing a year of peace for such a study
may obscure the realities of serving a nation that goes to war
about once a decade.
   Army researchers compared death rates among all 781,000 soldiers
to civilian counterparts of the same age, race and sex in 1986.
   The study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association did not give actual death rates. However, the
lead researcher said in a telephone interview that soldiers overall
died at a rate of 109 per 100,000, while comparable civilians died
at a rate of 215 per 100,000.
   The greatest disparity was for homicides, almost six times less
common among soldiers than civilians, followed by smaller Army
rates of deaths cause by disease and suicide, the researchers
reported.
   The most striking difference was among black men, who died in
homicides almost 12 times less often in the Army than in the
population at large. The homicide rate among black soldiers was 9
per 100,000, compared with 100 per 100,000 for black civilians,
said lead author Joseph M. Rothberg, a mathematician in military
psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.
   Women in the Army, who comprised 10.2 percent of soldiers, died
at 78 percent the rate of civilian women of the same age. Black
women soldiers died at 39 percent the rate of comparable civilians.
But white women soldiers died at 139 percent the rate of white
women civilians of the same age.
   A large component of the elevated death rate among white Army
women was due to their suffering more than 2{ times as many fatal
accidents as civilian women the same age, but the researchers could
not say why.
   ``There are a number of factors that determine the probability
of death for any individual, and they're different for the Army
than for civilian life,'' said Rothberg.
   Most important is the screening of Army volunteers, who must
have high school degrees and are healthy enough to pass a physical
exam, Rothberg said in a telephone interview Tuesday from Bethesda,
Md.
   He also said the Army provides housing, food, meaningful work
and ``lots of fresh air and exercise.'' It controls substance abuse
and regulates firearms, he said.
   ``Everybody's told how to live their life and how to stay
healthy. In civilian life, it's the individual's option,'' he said.
   Sam Sarkesian, a political science professor at Loyola
University in Chicago, said he believed the study could give a
skewed picture because it reflects peacetime mortality. Yet, he
noted, ``we've been involved in a war virtually every 10 years
since the end of World War II.''
   Even in non-war years, members of the military die violently,
such as in the 1983 Beirut bombing, when 237 Marines were killed;
in the 1985 Gander, Newfoundland, airplane crash, when 248 died;
and in the 1989 Panama invasion, when 23 lost their lives.
   ``From 1945 on, if you'd put all those together and compare it
to the equivalent in civilian life, I think you'd get a totally
different picture,'' Sarkesian said.
   But Charles Moskos, a sociology professor at Northwestern
University in Evanston, said: ``Most of military life is peacetime.
A peace year is more normal than a war year.''
   Still, ``It's a sad commentary on America when military service
is healthier for black youths than civilian life,'' said Moskos,
head of an international group of 600 military social scientists.

<TEXT>
   The mayor of an eastern town was shot to
death at his re-election campaign headquarters, and the Interior
Ministry blamed a domestic dispute.
   Police said Roberto Antonio Bonilla, 52, was killed by two
assailants on Monday night in Jalapa, 63 miles east of Guatemala
City.
   Jalapa is one of about 300 towns that will hold mayoral and city
council elections on Sunday. Voters also will elect a president,
vice president, 116 members of congress and 20 Central American
Parliament deputies.
   A security guard shot one of Bonilla's killers to death, and
officers were looking for the other one, police said in a telephone
interview.
   There has been other election violence, but Interior Minister
Gen. Carlos Morales Villatoro said there was no political motive
behind Bonilla's killing.
   ``In accordance with investigations, it was determined that
(Bonilla) was slain by a person who was to have married his
daughter,'' Morales Villatoro said in a statement Tuesday night.
``Consequently, this crime was strictly due to family problems and
there is nothing political in it.''
   The statement did not give the killer's name.
   Bonilla is the second mayoral candidate killed since the
campaign began. Also, two Central American Parliament candidates
were attacked on Oct. 18, two other political party activists were
slain earlier and one federal deputy was assassinated.
   Bonilla was elected in 1985 on the National Center Union ticket.
This year he was running as the candidate of the center-left
Christian Democrats and the Revolutionary Party.
   Twelve candidates are in the running for the presidency,
including publisher Jorge Carpio Nicolle, who is favored in opinion
polls.
   Carpio founded the National Center Union party seven years ago
and lost a runoff against Christian Democrat President Vinicio
Cerezo in 1985.
   Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the Christian Democratic candidate, has
been in a hospital in Houston for three days with pancreas trouble.
   A runoff is scheduled for Jan. 6 if none of the 12 candidates
gets more than 50 percent of the vote.
   Former dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt ran unsuccessfuly for
president on the Christian Democrat ticket in 1974, and was
disqualified from candidacy this year because he took power through
a 1982 military coup.

<TEXT>
   A previously unknown group on Wednesday
called for the overthrow of Saudi Arabia's ruling family and the
creation of a democratic system that would not need foreign forces
to protect it.
   The group called the National Revolution and Struggle Front in
the Arab Peninsula sent a four-page manifesto by fax outlining its
demands to The Associated Press in Nicosia.
   The group gave little information about itself. It said only
that it was based in the Arab peninsula. The line indicating where
the fax originated was scratched out on every page.
   The statement's lack of specific detail and the wording of some
of its demands indicated that it might be Iraqi propaganda.
   The group said the Al-Saud family, which has ruled Saudi Arabia
since King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud unified the kingdom in 1932, should
be replaced by a constitutional democracy and the country be
renamed the Arab Peninsula.
   Citizens should be guaranteed the right to form trade unions and
political organizations, and there should be free speech and a free
press, the statement said. None of these is allowed in Saudi Arabia
now.
   The statement demanded that foreign troops in Saudi Arabia be
sent home and that the country pursue a policy of non-alignment.
More than 250,000 troops, most of them American, have been sent to
the country since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The group said it wanted to reinforce links with the Arab world
and give greater support to the Palestinian cause.
   The wealth from the Saudi oil industry should be invested in
national agricultural and industrial projects less connected to
foreign powers, the statement said.

   Four non-aligned members of the Security
Council drafted a plan Tuesday urging simultaneous withdrawal of
Iraqi forces from Kuwait and of foreign military units from the
region.
   The conciliatory proposal was given little chance of passage in
the 15-member council but will prolong negotiations over an
expected U.S.-backed measure to distribute Iraqi assets now frozen
to victims of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
   The four sponsors - Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen - met
with General Assembly members in hopes of attracting dozens of
endorsements that could be used to try to pressure reluctant
Security Council members.
   The plan came as U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
visited the Middle East, seeking support for stronger U.N. action.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met Baker in Egypt Tuesday and
signaled China's willingness to go along with a U.N. resolution to
authorize the use of force to liberate Kuwait, U.S. officials said.
   China is one of the Security Council's five permanent members
and can veto a council decision.
   The council has passed 10 anti-Iraq resolutions since Kuwait was
invaded, including measures to establish a trade embargo and
establish an air and sea blockade to enforce it.
   A multinational force of about 300,000 troops has been arrayed
against Iraq following the invasion, including about 230,000 U.S.
servicemen.
   Tuesday's proposal asks establishment of an all-Arab U.N.
peacekeeping force to maintain order in Kuwait after ``the
simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the
region.''
   It demands immediate Iraqi withdrawal from the emirate and says
all previous U.N. sanctions on Baghdad would then be lifted. It
says damage claims would then be heard before the World Court.
   The resolution urges ``prompt compliance with other outstanding
Security Council resolutions, including those relating to the
conflict in the Middle East, in particular, the Palestinian
question.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has tried to link the Kuwait
issue with Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The United States and other Western nations say Iraq should pull
out first, without conditions.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
would press on with a harsher resolution against Iraq. One source
expects a U.S. proposal ``within two or three days'' to attach
frozen Iraqi assets.
   The Security Council also is expected to take up the issue of
the Israeli-occupied territories and how to safeguard Palestinians
there. The Palestine Liberation Organization is proposing that the
Security Council send unarmed U.N. observers to the territories,
but Israel has rejected the idea.
   The council was scheduled to meet Wednesday on the PLO proposal.
   New violence in the Gaza Strip has dramatized the issue.

   Lesotho's military ruler declared exiled
King Moshoeshoe II officially dethroned Tuesday and stripped him of
his title of head of state.
   Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya, head of the ruling military council,
said he was retracting an Oct. 24 invitation for Moshoeshoe to
return from exile in London. Moshoeshoe set unacceptable conditions
for his return, including dissolution of the present government,
Lekhanya told the National Constituent Assembly.
   ``The king has been a problem for Lesotho for the past 25 years,
and the nation would be relieved at his dethronement,'' Lekhanya
said.
   Moshoeshoe was forced into exile in March following
disagreements with Lekhanya, who came to power in a 1986 coup that
ousted Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan. Lekhanya's six-member
military council gave the king some executive and legislative
authority, but in February Lekhanya fired from the military council
and government most supporters of the monarch.
   When Moshoeshoe refused to approve replacements, Lekhanya told
the king to leave the country.
   When he issued the invitation for Moshoeshoe to return, Lekhanya
said the two had held ``warm and constructive discussions'' in
Britain and settled their differences. Sources close to the
government said the king had agreed to accept a role as
constitutional monarch with no executive power.
   In Tuesday's announcement, Lekhanya said that when the king
imposed conditions for his return, the military council decided to
strip him of all powers.
   Lekhanya did not say when a replacement would be named, but it
was expected to be Moshoeshoe's eldest son, Prince Mohato. He is in
Lesotho.
   Lesotho, a small landlocked country surrounded by South Africa,
gained independence from Britain in 1966. Lekhanya has promised a
new constitution and a return to civilian rule by 1992.

<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell on
Tuesday turned back Democrat Harvey Sloane, who had hoped a ripple
of anti-incumbent sentiment would grow into a wave and wash his
opponent out of office after a single term.
   With 81 percent of precincts reporting, McConnell had 383,710
votes, or 53 percent, to 345,710, or 47 percent, for Sloane.
   Heading into the election, Sloane didn't appear to have
benefitted much from voter anger against Congress, and McConnell
was favored to win a second term.
   In polls conducted by The (Louisville) Courier-Journal,
McConnell's support eroded from 53 percent to 44 percent between
September and late October. But Sloane's support stayed relatively
constant at 33 percent in September and 34 percent in October, and
undecided voters grew from 14 percent to 22 percent.
   Sloane, a non-practicing physician and former Louisville mayor,
had a relatively meager campaign bank of about $2 million to
finance commercial attacks on McConnell and so began using
increasingly harsh language in his appearances. At times, Sloane
called McConnell a liar, sham and hypocrite.
   McConnell responded with an advertising blitz paid for with more
than $5 million in campaign funds that depicted Sloane as a
free-spending liberal who couldn't manage government when he was a
mayor and county executive.
   All four Democrats in Kentucky's congressional delegation had
opponents. Only one of the three Republican congressmen had
opposition.

   Dade County blacks, including students, teachers
and bus drivers, boycotted schools Tuesday as a protest against
what community leaders call a series of racist affronts.
   Boycott leaders encouraged participants to use their time to
vote, and turnout at the polls soared in black neighborhoods.
   Many predominantly black schools in the nation's fourth-largest
district had only 20 or 30 percent attendance. And 72 percent of
the school bus drivers stayed home, creating long delays for
students who did not boycott, district spokeswoman JoAn Moye said.
   Even teachers who did not honor the boycott wore black ribbons
showing support for the action.
   ``I think it's having a tremendous effect,'' said the Rev.
Victor Curry, whose church held a teach-in for boycotting students
and teachers. ``All across the county, we are hearing that teachers
are not reporting to school, as well as bus drivers and students.''
   James Fleming, associate superintendent of schools, confirmed
that large numbers of black students and teachers joined the
boycott.
   Blacks account for 33 percent of Dade's students, and district
absenteeism on Tuesday was 30 percent. He said 2,500 teachers also
honored the boycott, along with the district's bus drivers, most of
whom are black.
   ``It totally crippled the transportation system,'' Fleming said.
``But we can understand and empathize with the frustration people
must feel and their need to express that.''
   About 1,000 protesters carrying signs reading ``Stop Racism
Now'' and ``Keep the Pressure On'' showed up for a noon rally in
front of school district headquarters.
   Dade County elections officials reported that, based on initial
voting patterns Tuesday morning, projected black turnout was 80 to
90 percent, in contrast to the countywide figure of 67 percent. The
black turnout raised Dade's total projected turnout from a 59
percent initial estimate to almost 64 percent, said David Leahy,
elections supervisor.
   The boycott was touched off by last month's appointment of
Octavio Visiedo, a Cuban-American, as schools superintendent. Black
leaders had supported Tee S. Greer, a black administrator who had
previously acted as interim superintendent. They complained that
Greer not only had more experience but, unlike Visiedo, has a
doctorate.
   ``This is an issue of racism and the time has come to face it,''
said the Rev. Richard Dunn, a boycott organizer.
   School board members would speak only in general terms about
their reason for choosing Visiedo, who has overseen a massive
building program for the district.
   ``He does address the needs of the whole community,'' school
board member and Visiedo-backer Betsy Kaplan said.
   The school district did not condemn the boycott, saying only
that the staff was working to take care of the students who
attended classes. ``We're going to cope with it,'' Ms. Moye said.
   Dunn said Visiedo's appointment was only the latest in a series
of incidents, including the snub of South African anti-apartheid
leader Nelson Mandela by the county's Cuban-American mayors in
June, and violent police repression of a black demonstration
outside a store after a fight between a Haitian customer and the
shop's Cuban owner.
   Tuesday's school boycott received wide support from parents and
students.
   ``I don't like what they did, so I decided not to come to
school,'' said Joseph Small, a student at Edison High. ``I told my
father, and he approved it.''

   A car apparently ran a stop sign and was
broadsided by a tractor-trailer truck Tuesday, killing five members
of a family, authorities said.
   A Morrisville woman, her daughter-in-law and three of the
younger woman's four children were killed, the Polk County
Coroner's office said. The younger woman's husband and their
4-year-old son were injured.
   Polk County Coroner Sidney Pitts identified the dead as driver
Alline Schnick, 65; passenger Sharon Schnick, 45, and the children,
Katrina Schnick, 19 months; Jennifer Schnick, 5; and Kimberly
Ducker, 9.
   Gary Schnick, 42, was in critical condition and his son, Joshua,
was in serious condition at a hospital Tuesday.
   The truck driver and his passenger were not injured in the 7:30
a.m. accident at Missouri highways 13 and 215, about 15 miles north
of Springfield, a highway patrol spokesman said.

<HEAD>Austria Scraps Two Provisions of State Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday declared
obsolete two provisions of the 1955 state treaty that gave Austria
its postwar independence following 10 years of occupation by the
four World War II Allies.
   The move could signal a revision of Austria's neutral status,
which is hindering Austrian attempts to become a full member of the
European Community.
   The provisions ban the purchase of missiles, German-made
armaments and German civilian planes and restrict the restitution
to German citizens of property held by Nazi Germany in Austria.
   The state treaty was signed on May 15, 1955 after arduous
negotiations with Moscow. It provided for withdrawal of Soviet and
all Allied troops. Five months later, as part of a tacit agreement
with the Kremlin, Austria enacted a law guaranteeing this nation's
permanent neutrality.
   Neutral status has come increasingly into question with the
unification of neighboring Germany and the collapse of Communist
rule in Eastern Europe.
   Leaders of the major parties say Austria will cling to its
neutrality. But several foreign officials and legal experts argue
this would preclude Austria's attempt to join the 12-nation EC.
   Austria apparently did not seek prior formal approval to cancel
the two provisions from the states which signed the 1955 treaty -
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said there had been contacts on the
issue with the four nations and those governments will be
officially informed of the move. The Soviet government said in a
memorandum that ``being mindful of the changed situation in
Europe'' and contacts with the other allies and Austria, it did not
object to the decision, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   When U.S. Ambassador Roy Huffington took up his duties here at
the end of September, he said Washington would approve changes in
the state treaty following prior consultations with Austria.

<HEAD>Jury Rules Lawyer Must Relinquish Ruby's Gun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer was removed Tuesday as executor of Jack
Ruby's estate, whose major asset is the .38-caliber Colt Cobra
revolver the Dallas nightclub owner used to kill presidential
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.
   A six-person jury ruled that Ruby's former attorney, Jules
Mayer, grossly mismanaged the estate after Ruby died in 1967. Mayer
still practices law at age 82.
   Dallas County Probate Judge Robert E. Price must now decide how
to distribute Ruby's assets. State law mandates that if he upholds
the jury's decision, he must appoint a new executor. No hearing
date was set.
   Ruby's brother, Earl, filed the lawsuit, asking to be named
executor of the estate. Ruby's heirs and Mayer have wrangled over
the estate for 23 years.
   The gun Ruby used to kill Oswald in the Dallas County Jail two
days after President Kennedy's assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, is
stowed in a bank safe deposit box. Mayer has said it could bring
$125,000 on the collectors' market. Ruby bought the gun for $62.50
in a Dallas gun shop.
   Mayer wanted proceeds from the gun's sale to pay off Ruby's
debts. He said they include the $65,000 it has cost him to handle
the estate, including the expense of fighting Earl Ruby's lawsuits.
   Earl Ruby, of Boca Raton, Fla., who is also acting on behalf of
his sister and a nephew, charges that Mayer is trying to profit
from the estate. He wants the estate liquidated to pay off his
brother's debts and ``wipe the slate clean.''
   Ruby was convicted of murder in 1964 and sentenced to die in the
electric chair. A Texas appeals court overturned the conviction in
1966, citing reasons that included failure to move the trial from
Dallas. Ruby died at age 55 before a new trial could be held.

   Republican Rep. Bob Smith jumped easily
Tuesday into the U.S. Senate seat being abandoned by the downwardly
mobile Gordon Humphrey, who left Congress to run for the state
Legislature.
   Smith's Democratic opponent, John Durkin, had based his campaign
on charges that Smith was beholden to special interest groups that
poured more than $500,000 into his campaign.
   With 8 percent of precincts reporting, Smith had 17,582 votes,
or 65 percent, to Durkin's 9,327 votes, or 35 percent.
   Republican Gov. Judd Gregg returned to the Statehouse for a
second two-year term, fending off Democrat Joe Grandmaison's
charges he was incompetent to lead the state out of its economic
doldrums.
   With 8 percent of precincts reporting, Gregg had 16,691 votes or
62 percent, to 10,418, or 38 percent, for Grandmaison.
   In the bitter Senate contest, Durkin, a U.S. senator from
1975-1980, used tart one-liners to jab Smith, calling him
``Bumbling Bob'' and the ``bag man'' for PACs.
   Durkin used the term ``Japs'' to accuse a Japanese-made
automobile trade PAC of trying to buy Smith the seat with a
$350,000 media campaign. He later apologized for the slur, and
Smith wrote the PAC and asked it to stop the ads.

   Also with 29 percent of precincts reporting, Gore had 148,936

   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer held on
to his job Tuesday in his battle with William and Lois Shepard, the
Republican husband-and-wife team who ran for governor and
lieutenant governor.
   With 23 percent of precincts reporting, Scheafer had 105,919
votes, or 60 percent, to 69,545 votes, or 40 percent, for Shepard.
   Schaefer's early strong standing had slipped as Shepard hammered
away at the governor as a big spender who had turned a $400 million
surplus into a current deficit estimated at up to $300 million.
   The challenger angered many Republican leaders when he picked
his wife as his ticket-mate. He slowly regained much of the party
support, but his campaign was crippled by lack of money. Schaefer
raised more than $2.3 million and Shepard just over $100,000.
   All eight incumbent members of Congress - six Democrats and two
Republicans - sought re-election. Only Democrat Roy Dyson, locked
in a tight battle with Wayne Gilchrest, faced a serious challenge.

   Democratic challenger Joan Finney led Gov.
Mike Hayden, who had been only slightly favored to win re-election
Tuesday and become the first two-term Republican governor in Kansas
in 28 years.
   Finney, the state treasurer, was bidding to become Kansas' first
woman governor.
   With 8 percent of precincts reporting, Finney had 34,296 votes,
or 56 percent, to 26,646 votes, or 44 percent, for Hayden.
   Hayden and Mrs. Finney had been deadlocked in polls through the
final month of the campaign. The incumbent finally edged marginally
ahead at the end.
   U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, daughter of the late Gov. Alf Landon,
defeated her Democratic challenger, Dick Williams of Wichita, who
teaches English as a second language to college students.
   With 3 percent of precincts reporting, Kassebaum had 16,197
votes, or 72 percent, to 6,298 votes, or 28 percent, for Williams.
   Four incumbent U.S. House members also were strong favorites to
win re-election, while the 5th District of southeast Kansas was
electing a replacement for retiring Republican Rep. Bob Whittaker.
Republican Dick Nichols, a banker, was slightly favored over former
Democratic state Rep. George Wingert.
   A Nichols' victory would maintain the 3-2 Republican advantage
in the state's U.S. House delegation.
   Voters also were expected to reject a proposed state
constitutional amendment that would restore full control of public
education to the Legislature, rather than keeping it vested in
independent boards.
   Hayden, 46, battled a perception that he is mean-spirited,
unable to build legislative support for his programs and
responsible for large property tax increases.
   Mrs. Finney, 65, became the first woman nominee of a major party
when she defeated former Gov. John Carlin by 1 percentage point in
the August Democratic primary.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of mourners, some vengeful, some
crying ``Never again!'', thronged a Brooklyn synagogue Tuesday to
bid farewell to the assassinated Meir Kahane and to pledge to carry
on the radical rabbi's anti-Arab war.
   His alleged killer, a Moslem who immigrated from Egypt in 1981
and took U.S. citizenship last year, lay in critical condition in a
Manhattan hospital. Police said he had no links with terrorist
groups.
   ``There will be revenge. We believe in revenge,'' said Sol
Margolis, president of Kach International, the U.S. arm of Kahane's
extremist party, which advocates the ouster of Arabs from
Israeli-held territory.
   Kahane was gunned down Monday night while addressing a Zionist
group at a Manhattan hotel. Police said Kahane was taking questions
from the crowd when the gunman stopped 4 feet from him and fired a
.357-caliber weapon.
   The Israeli government appealed forpeace as police and army
reinforcements spread out in Israel and the occupied territories to
head off revenge attacks. The deaths two Arabs on Tuesday were
linked to Kahane's slaying.
   The fear of retribution in New York prompted stepped-up security
at the U.N. missions for Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, El Al
Israel Airlines offices and several Jewish newspapers, said Police
Commissioner Lee Brown.
   The alleged gunman, a $30,000-a-year city maintenance man, was
shot in the neck by a U.S. Postal police officer who spotted him
fleeing the hotel.
   The suspect, identified by city officials as El-Sayyid A.
Nosair, 35, of Cliffside Park, N.J., was in critical condition,
hospital officials said. He was charged with murder, attempted
murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and of a defaced
weapon, and unlawful imprisonment, police said.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said he believed the gunman
acted alone. Nosair had no previous criminal record and no links to
any terrorist organizations, Borrelli said.
   Nosair's wife, Caren, and three children were staying with
relatives in Brooklyn. Mrs. Nosair provided no clues about her
husband's motives, Borrelli said. Police searched Nosair's
apartment.
   Until four months ago, the family lived in Jersey City, where
Nosair's former neighbors described him as a quiet, intellectual
man with no involvement in political organizations in the city's
400-strong Moslem community.
   ``They were just a basic family,'' said Laura-Jean Banks, 36.
``I couldn't believe it was him because he was so quiet.''
   Nosair was carrying three New Jersey driver's licenses with
different addresses when he was arrested, said Jersey City police
Deputy Chief John McAuley.
   Thousands of people jammed a synagogue in Brooklyn and spilled
onto a four-lane highway for the funeral of the 58-year-old Kahane.
His body was to be flown to Israel for burial Wednesday.
   ``It is possible for the heart to well up and cry for the
horrible loss our nation has suffered,'' Rabbi Moshe Tendler of
Yeshiva University said as thousands cheered outside Young Israel
of Ocean Parkway Synagogue.
   Rabbi Herbert Bomzer, a longtime friend and leader of the
synagogue where the service was held, said Kahane was always
welcome there. Many synagogues barred Kahane because he sanctioned
violence.
   ``Rabbi Meir Kahane was a friend, a leader, a fighter, a writer,
a thinker. He was a spokesman for the defense of Jews all around
the world,'' Bomzer said.
   The militant Jewish Defense League, founded by Kahane in 1968,
has been linked by the FBI to various acts of violence, including a
1972 firebombing that killed one person and injured 13 others.
   The loudest applause came when Bomzer proclaimed that Kahane
``was a strident voice calling `Never Again,''' the slogan used by
Kahane in reference to the Holocaust.
   ``Tell all Arabs don't sleep so quiet tonight,'' Margolis said.
``We are Jews, we are religious Jews and we don't buy that crap of
turning the other cheek. There will be hell to pay for this
affront.''
   Asked if he was threatening Arabs, Margolis said: ``I use simple
English and I won't elaborate beyond this.''
   Police had no official crowd estimate. The synagogue holds about
1,000 people. Thousands more clamored to get near the building and
loudspeakers were set up so those outside could hear the service.
Occasional fights were broken up by an estimated 200 police
officers who were there to control the crowd.
   Moderate voices called for calm.
   ``This is not the time to be speaking of revenge; it is the time
to be speaking of peace and reconciliation,'' said Rabbi Marc D.
Angel, president of the Rabbinical Council of America.
   ``The guilty person should be tried and punished under our
laws,'' said Rabbi Irwin Groner, president of the Rabbinical
Asembly. ``But we urge that no further violence be perpetrated.
This will only lead to more violence and bloodshed.''
   The New York-born Kahane, who moved to Israel in 1971 and served
four years in Israel's parliament until his extremist party was
banned, was struck by a single bullet in the neck and died an hour
later at Bellevue Hospital.
   The postal officer and a bystander at the hotel also were
wounded. They were in stable condition, Bellevue Hospital
spokeswoman Brenda Rivera said.
   In an interview with a Miami radio station Sunday, Kahane said
he feared he would be killed by a Jew, not an Arab, said radio host
Danny Tadmore.
   ``He said, `I don't have a problem with the Arabs, I have a
problem with the Jews,''' Tadmore said Tuesday. ```And if
somebody's ever going to kill me, it's going to be a Jew, not an
Arab.'''
   Department of General Services spokesman John Beckman said
Nosair has been a city employee since 1988. Israel Army radio
reported that Nosair once lived in the occupied territories.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the killing
``a despicable and cowardly act.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar also decried
Kahane's killing and violence in the occupied territories. ``He
deplores these and all acts of violence,'' said a spokeswoman,
Nadia Younes.
   State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who represents the rabbi's old
Brooklyn neighborhood, said Kahane didn't want police protection.
   ``He said that when his turn would come, when God called him, no
one could prevent it,'' said Hikind.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James Blanchard struggled in a surprisingly
tough race Tuesday against Republican John Engler, who went after
the Democratic incumbent hitting hard on cutting property taxes.
U.S. Sen. Carl Levin outdid his GOP foe and kept his seat.
   With 4 percent of precincts reporting, Blanchard had 52,060
votes, or 51 percent, to 50,401 votes, or 49 percent, for Engler.
   In the Senate race, U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette tried to play up his
longstanding opposition to taxes - he's never voted for a tax
increase during six years in Congress. But he made little headway
against the popular Levin.
   With 4 percent of precincts reporting, Levin had 84,732 votes,
or 58 percent, to 61,393 votes, or 42 percent, for Schuette.
   A Detroit News poll published Sunday showed Blanchard, the
two-term governor, with a 14-point lead, 54 percent to 40 percent,
but Engler predicted an upset, saying his promise to cut property
taxes by 20 percent had caught on with voters.
   In the final days of the race, Engler handed out 5,000 nickels
as he campaigned. ``That's how much Jim Blanchard wants to cut your
property taxes each week. I think it's an insult,'' Engler said.
   In the U.S. House races, 10 Democrats and 5 Republicans bid for
re-election. Another two Congressional seats were open races.

   A jury ordered Toyota Motor Corp. to pay a couple
$7.5 million in damages after the seat belt in their 4Runner
vehicle failed during a crash and the husband was severely injured.
   Company officials were shocked by the size of the award and plan
to appeal, said Toyota spokeswoman Mindy Geller.
   Since the Feb. 9, 1988, accident, Cliff Sadlier has had to rely
primarily on a wheelchair to get around, but he can walk short
distances with crutches and braces.
   Sadlier, of suburban Bloomfield Hills, said the vehicle's selt
belt failed when he was driving alone and crashed into a tree. When
the belt failed, his head went through the windshield and his body
hit the dashboard.
   He and his wife, Joanne, sued the company, saying the belt
lacked a device to take up slack in the belt. Toyota's lawyers said
the belt met federal specifications.
   ``We felt the seat belt was defective by design,'' said Robert
Gura, foreman of the U.S. District jury that granted the award
Monday. ``It doesn't provide the protection the federal law says it
should.''
   Gura also is a supervisor at Chrysler Corp.'s stamping plant in
Warren, Mich.

   Sen. Bill Bradley, an immensely popular
Democrat who often is mentioned as a presidential contender, was in
a dead heat Tuesday with his Republican challenger, Christine Todd
Whitman.
   With 52 percent of precincts reporting, Bradley had 506,494
votes, or 50 percent, to 505,904 votes, or 50 percent, for Mrs.
Whitman.
   Republicans did their best to tar Bradley and his fellow
Democrats with the brush of Gov. Jim Florio's unpopular tax hikes.
Florio wasn't on the ballot.
   A Star Ledger-Eagleton poll released last week showed Bradley
leading Mrs. Whitman by a 36-point margin. Mrs. Whitman is a former
president of the state Board of Public Utilities and a member of a
prominent New Jersey Republican family.
   The Florio tax package has provided most of the fodder for GOP
campaigning throughout the state. But with President Bush embracing
a variety of higher taxes on the federal level in late October, the
tax issue became a more ambiguous issue for both parties.
   There are two open congressional seats among the state's total
of 14, but neither contested race was expected to alter the
political balance of the delegation. There are seven Democratic
congressmen and six GOP representatives in New Jersey, with one
seat - the one abandoned by Florio - vacant.

<TEXT>
   George Voinovich, the popular former mayor
of Cleveland, swept to victory in the governor's race Tuesday,
ending eight years of Democratic control.
   Voinovich, a Republican, beat Democrat Anthony J. Celebrezze
Jr., the state's attorney general. Polls throughout the campaign
showed Voinovich with big leads, although the margin narrowed
toward the end of the campaign.
   With 28 percent of precincts reporting, Voinovich had 519,393
votes, or 55 percent, to 431,625 votes, or 45 percent, for
Celebrezze.
   The incumbent, Democrat Richard Celeste, will leave office in
January after serving two consecutive terms, the most allowed by
law. He has been governor since 1983. Republican Jim Rhodes was
governor before that.
   Ohio will have at least three new members of Congress because of
the departures of Democratic Rep. Thomas Luken and Republican Reps.
Michael DeWine and Donald Lukens. Luken is retiring, DeWine ran for
lieutenant governor, and Lukens was defeated in the May primary
after being convicted of having sex with a teen-age girl.
   Ohio's delegation is now divided 11 Democrats to 10 Republicans.
All but one seat were contested.
   The closest race was between Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell and
Democrat Charles Luken, mayor of Cincinnati and Luken's son. The
GOP considered Blackwell's candidacy important because of the
possibility of a black Republican being elected to Congress.
   Voters also were deciding whether to change the state
constitution to permit casino gambling. At issue was whether
residents of Lorain should be permitted to decide in a later
election whether to allow construction of a casino in their city.

<HEAD>Democrat Cuomo Wins Third Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo breezed to a third term over
splintered Republican opposition Tuesday, maintaining his standing
as a leader of the Democratic Party and potential presidential
candidate for 1992.
   While Cuomo has consistently maintained that he ``has no plans
to run for president and no plans to make plans,'' Democratic
leaders said a re-election victory would increase interest in him.
   ``He'll be under more pressure than he's ever been under
before,'' Robert Strauss, a former Democratic national chairman,
predicted last week.
   Cuomo's opposition included millionaire economist Pierre
Rinfret, the Republican challenger who was an unknown in New York
politics six months ago, and Conservative Party nominee Herbert
London.
   With 19 percent of precincts reporting, Cuomo had 389,863 votes,
or 49 percent, to 193,809 votes, or 24 percent, for Rinfret, and
181,166 votes, or 23 percent, for London.
   In the final two months of the campaign, the outspoken,
underfunded Rinfret spent almost as much time bashing prominent
Republicans as he did attacking Democrat Cuomo. Rinfret's paltry
campaign war chest reflected GOP displeasure.
   With Rinfret's campaign in shambles, Republicans scrambled to
produce enough loyal voters to keep London from finishing second.
By finishing third, the GOP could lose its second-row ballot spot
in New York elections for at least the next four years.
   Also threatened by a possible low Republican turnout was GOP
control of the state Senate.
   A Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll released last
week had Cuomo the choice of 61 percent of those surveyed with
Rinfret and London tied for second place at 11 percent each.
   Of New York's 34 congressional members, 21 Democrats and 13
Republicans, five ran unopposed and the others were favored to win
re-election.
   On Staten Island, voters decided whether to start a process that
could lead to secession for the smallest of New York City's five
boroughs.
   Meanwhile, Cuomo asked voters statewide to approve a $2 billion
environmental bond act that would provide $800 million to buy land
and $625 million for garbage problems.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Voters Have Little Faith in Congress, Nation's Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters were a gloomy bunch with little faith
in Congress or the nation's future, according to an Election Day
telephone poll.
   Nearly three-quarters of those questioned Tuesday in the ABC
News Voter Poll said the economic outlook was getting worse and the
nation was on the wrong track. An overwhelming majority of those
with dim views were Democrats.
   The poll respondents rated the deficit and the Persian Gulf
standoff the nation's most important problems. Their top few ``very
important voting issues'' included the federal budget, Iraq, taxes
and the national economy.
   The poll suggested that recent Republican waffling over taxes
and the federal budget has reinforced the perception that the GOP
is the party of the rich.
   Two-thirds of those questioned said the Democratic Party was
``best for the poor'' while 79 percent - including 37 percent of
the Republicans - said the Republicans were ``best for the rich.''
   Looked at by income groups, 66 percent of voters making less
than $15,000 a year said they voted for Democrats. The Democrats
also were favored by those making up to $49,000. Among those making
more than that, the vote was about evenly split between the two
parties.
   The voters in the survey also were evenly split on which party
they said could be ``trusted on future problems.''
   But there was broad bipartisan support for President Bush's
policies in Iraq - 69 percent total, including 45 percent of the
Democrats. About the same percentages said they would support U.S.
force if it is needed in the gulf.
   Bush's approval rating may be lower than it once was, but the
ABC poll suggests people are more than three times as fed up with
Congress.
   A full 57 percent of those questioned said they approved of
Bush's performance - but only 18 percent said they approved of the
way Congress was doing its job.
   In addition, 77 percent said Congress needs ``fresh ideas''
rather than experience.
   Despite their negative view of Congress, however, 62 percent
said they approved of their own House member's performance. And
when push came to shove, more than half - 55 percent - said they
voted to retain their current congressman or woman.
   In a very early peek at the 1992 presidential race, Bush came
out substantially ahead of an array of Democrats who conceivably
might run. But doubts about Vice President Dan Quayle persisted,
with only 44 percent of those questioned saying he was qualified to
be president.
   The ABC poll was based on interviews with 661 people who had
already voted or who indicated in replies to several screening
questions that they were going to vote. The poll-takers warned that
telephone polling sometimes overstates turnout since some people do
not make it to the voting booth.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent.

<HEAD>Attorney Grills Woman Who Recalled Watching Dad Kill Best Friend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense lawyer on Tuesday attacked
the credibility of a woman who claims she suddenly remembered
watching her father molest and kill her best friend 20 years ago.
   During a second day of cross-examination, defense attorney
Douglas Horngrad pointed out variations in Eileen
Franklin-Lipsker's story since she first claimed the resurfacing of
a repressed memory last year.
   Horngrad demanded to know why she changed her story after
telling relatives the memory surfaced while she was under hypnosis.
Ms. Franklin-Lipsker has acknowledged telling family members months
later that she lied about the hypnosis to make her story more
believable.
   Horngrad suggested Ms. Franklin-Lipsker changed her story
because she learned hypnotically-induced memory would not stand up
in court.
   ``By that time, you knew that hypnotically-induced testimony was
inadmissible in California?'' Horngrad asked.
   ``No, I don't think so,'' Ms. Franklin-Lipsker said.
   George Franklin Sr., 51, was charged with killing 8-year-old
Susan Nason after his daughter told police she had suddenly
remembered the Sept. 22, 1969, attack. He pleaded innocent to the
charges.
   Ms. Franklin-Lipsker, now 29, claims her father threatened to
kill her if she told anyone about the crime. She testified the
memory flooded back last year as she looked at her own young
daughter, and details of the crime emerged in subsequent months.
   Nason's body was discovered in a ravine three months after she
was reported missing. A blood-stained rock was discovered nearby.
   On Tuesday, Horngrad also questioned Ms. Franklin-Lipsker about
when and how the memory resurfaced.
   Ms. Franklin-Lipsker testified she first recalled the murder in
January 1989 and told a therapist about it five months later,
saying the memory had ``recently'' resurfaced.
   Horngrad asked her why it took her so long to discuss the memory
with a professional. ``Is five months recent?'' he asked.
   ``I would say that if I had a 5-month-old memory of a
20-year-old murder, that's very recent,'' she replied.
   On Monday, Ms. Franklin-Lipsker recounted details of the slaying
and recalled that when she was 11, her father pinned her down on a
table as his best friend raped her.
   Like the alleged murder, Franklin-Lipsker testified, the memory
of the rape remained repressed until recently.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down Reform Plan for Injured Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reform plan that cut workers'
compensation benefits by 30 percent was struck down Tuesday by a
judge who said it was cluttered with unrelated, unconstitutional
provisions.
   The state will appeal the Circuit Court ruling and the law,
enacted earlier this year, will remain in effect until the outcome
of the appeal.
   The law was challenged by the Florida AFL-CIO and other unions.
They argued that 150 provisions of the law violated the Florida
Constitution, mainly denying an injured worker's right to appeal
lost benefits in court.
   Judge Lewis Hall did not declare that provision
unconstitutional, but said the law improperly dealt with workers'
compensation issues in violation of the constitution's requirement
that parts of a law be relevant to a single subject.
   ``How many subjects can you put under that broad an umbrella?''
Hall asked in his ruling.
   Hall said sections of the law setting up foreign trade offices
had little to do with workers' compensation and could have given
lawmakers a way to justify their votes on the bill, which was
supported by business but opposed by workers' groups.
   Other provisions violated separation of powers requirements by
giving the governor judicial authority through his appointments to
a commission set up to decide workers' appeals, he said.
   ``In essence, there's so much in there that it reduces the
accountability of the legislator because he can always say he voted
for the good part and not necessarily for the bad part,'' Hall
said.
   Deputy Attorney General Mitch Franks said he disagreed with
Hall's reasoning on the single subject and separation of powers
issues.
   State AFL-CIO President Dan Miller was elated with the ruling,
even though the state said it will bypass other courts and ask the
Florida Supreme Court to hear the appeal.
   ``I think it's a great victory for injured workers in this
case,'' Miller said. ``If the Supreme Court upholds this decision,
we'll revert back to the law that was in effect in 1989. It's not
perfect, but it's fairer than what the Legislature passed.''
   The Legislature enacted the comprehensive reform to reduce
skyrocketing workers' compensation insurance rates paid by
businesses by up to 25 percent.
   The reduction was achieved by slashing workers' benefits by
about one-third. Under the 1989 law, for example, the fringe
benefits of an injured worker were included in the amount used to
figure his workers' compensation. Such fringe benefits were removed
from the formula under the new law.

   Democrats on Tuesday won two more years in
control of the Senate as incumbents showed their strength. In the
most closely watched contest, conservative Sen. Jesse Helms was
leading in his battle against Democrat Harvey Gantt in North
Carolina.
   Democrats seemed assured of at least 51 seats, another Senate
majority, after results showed 12 of their incumbents had won and
several others were leading, including several who had been
targeted by the GOP.
   Republican incumbents showed similar strength, however, and it
appeared the GOP would hold on to all three seats where their
senators were retiring.
   Democrats had hoped to improve on their 55-45 majority anywhere
they could, but especially in North Carolina. Early returns and
exit polls, however, suggested Helms would survive.
   The race between Helms and Gantt captured national attention not
only because it was close, but because the candidates represent
such extremes.
   Helms is a national symbol of right-wing politics and the
Senate's most diehard opponent to civil rights legislation. Helms
ran campaign ads accusing Gantt, who is black, of favoring racial
quotas and taking advantage of minority-preference rules for
personal gain.
   Gantt is an unapologetic liberal and racial trailblazer, the
first black admitted to Clemson University. During the campaign, he
blamed Helms for the poor state of North Carolina education and the
state's environmental problems.
   Polls were kept open late in heavily black Durham County after
voting machines there broke down.
   Another Democratic challenge fell short in Kentucky, where
first-time Sen. Mitch McConnell beat off former county commissioner
Harvey Sloane.
   But in New Jersey, GOP challenger Christine Todd Whitman, a
virtual unknown in her first statewide bid, put a scare into
Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley. She was close behind him in the
polls.
   And in one of the open Senate seats, Rep. Robert Smith defeated
former Sen. John Durkin in New Hampshire, keeping that seat in the
GOP column.
   Democratic incumbents Claiborne Pell in Rhode Island, Carl Levin
in Michigan and Paul Simon in Illinois won surprisingly easy
victories over well-financed Republican House members. Sen. J.
James Exon, D-Neb., beat former Republican Rep. Hal Daub.
   Other incumbents of both parties won with ease.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, won unopposed. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and David Pryor,
D-Ark., also won without opponents.
   Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's deputy minority
leader, won easily.
   Other senior incumbents returned to office were Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., at 87 the Senate's oldest member, Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
John Warner, R-Va., David Boren, D-Okla., Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
William Cohen, R-Maine, and Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
   Nunn was one of several possible future presidential candidates
seeking re-election to the Senate Tuesday. Others who won
re-election were Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., handily won a third term and Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., who ran for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1988, also won.
   Indiana Republican incumbent Dan Coats, who was appointed to the
Senate seat vacated by Vice President Dan Quayle, won his bid for
election on his own over Democrat Baron Hill.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., whose second term appeared threatened
at one point because of voter discontent, crushed developer Jim
Rappaport.
   In Hawaii, incumbent Daniel Akaka was trying to hold for the
Democrats a seat his party has controlled since statehood. But
Republican Rep. Pat Saiki was running even in pre-election surveys
to Akaka, who was appointed to the Senate last spring following the
death of Sen. Spark Matsunaga.
   Another threatened Senate institution was Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.,
who has served four terms. Hatfield appeared a shoo-in until
businessman and scientist Harry Lonsdale, running as a Democrat,
tapped into voter discontent with politicians.
   Democrats also used the anti-Washington theme in Kentucky, South
Dakota and Minnesota as they went after GOP incumbents. Republicans
used the same tactic in Massachusetts.
   In Iowa, incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin was leading in his bid to
become the first Democrat in that state ever re-elected to the
Senate.
   Chances that Tuesday's 34 Senate elections would produce a major
shift in the chamber's current 55-45 partisan split appeared slim.
There was virtually no chance the Republicans would take over, or
that the Democrats would gain enough seats to assure an override of
every veto issued by Bush.
   But even a change of one seat could weaken or strengthen
President Bush's position. For example, the Senate recently failed
to override his veto of the 1990 Civil Rights bill by a single
vote.
   The North Carolina race was easily the most costly Senate
contest in the nation. At last report, two weeks before Election
Day, Helms had spent $10.8 million and Gantt $4.6 million. Both
candidates were getting most of their money from out of state.
   If the Democrats succeeded in adding seats, they would get their
biggest margin since the 59-41 majority they held from 1979 until
1981, the last two years of the Carter administration.
   California could get a new senator as a result of Tuesday's
election, but the seat would not change parties. If Republican Sen.
Pete Wilson were to beat Democrat Dianne Feinstein, he'd resign
from the Senate and appoint his successor.
   In the District of Columbia, Jesse Jackson won election as a
non-voting ``shadow senator'' to lobby Congress for statehood.

   Incumbent Gov. Alexander
Farrelly easily defeated challenger Juan Luis in gubernatorial
elections Tuesday in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   With 100 percent of the vote tabulated in the three Caribbean
islands, a U.S. territory, Farrelly topped former governor Luis by
13,331 votes to 9,078.
   The race had been expected to be close between the 66-year-old
Farrelly, a Democrat, and Luis, who was running as an independent.
   Virgin Islands non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress, Ron de
Lugo, a Democrat, ran unopposed for a ninth two-year term,
garnering 16,675 votes.
   Farrelly is a Yale-educated corporate lawyer vying for his
second four-year term. He is believed to have lost support for his
handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, which hit the
Caribbean in September 1989.
   The hurricane struck all three islands, including St. Thomas and
St. John, but St. Croix was affected the most. Residents there
accused the governor of being slow to react to the crisis because
he took several days to inspect the damage.
   Puerto Rican-born Luis, 50, had support among the islands'
Hispanic community, who are about 25 percent of the islands'
100,000 residents. He was governor from 1977 until 1986 but his
administration came under scrutiny following a controversy over a
multimillion-dollar public works contract.
   Widespread looting broke out in St. Croix after Hugo struck,
flattening one-third of the homes with its 200 mph winds. President
Bush sent in 1,100 military police to restore order and they stayed
for two months.

   Police used a bulldozer
Tuesday to flatten a blockade of trees, furniture and other debris
an Indian group erected across a roadway used by loggers and
arrested more than 60 protesters.
   No violence or injuries were reported as Royal Canadian Mounted
Police removed the 4-month-old blockade, though some protesters
were led away shouting and kicking.
   ``They're putting up some resistance,'' police Sgt. Peter
Montague said. ``We were expecting that.''
   While Indians chanted and beat drums, the officers escorted at
least 63 protesters to a nearby checkpoint and handcuffed them with
plastic restraints before being put aboard chartered buses.
   Montague said those arrested would have to sign notices
promising to appear in court before they would be released.
   The Mount Currie Indians band set up the 3-foot-tall barricade
on an unpaved road about 85 miles north of Vancouver on July 12 to
show support for Mohawk Indians in their standoff with police at
Oka, Quebec.
   After the Oka standoff was resolved, the group decided to
maintain its blockade to draw attention to its land claims.
   The British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday gave police power
to make arrests if necessary to remove the blockade.
   Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon said he would meet with Chief
Fraser Andrew of the Mount Currie Indian band on Wednesday to try
to persuade the Indians ``to honor and abide by the decision of the
courts.''
   Siddon said he would urge the group to settle its land claim
through the normal negotiation process.
   Loggers who often use Duffey Lake Road have been hurt by the
blockade. Logging contractors and their crews have had just a few
days of work since the blockade went up, said contractor Peter
Staehli.
   Trucks began rumbling down the roadway again after the blockade
was dismantled Tuesday.
   Terri John, a spokeswoman for the Lil'wat People's Movement,
vowed Monday that the group would not recognize the order and would
peacefully resist police orders to move.
   The Indians would ``continue to resist ... the B.C. Supreme
Court injunction because they have no jurisdiction over the Indian
nation,'' she said.
   The blockade was a series of mounds of earth, some teepees and
old couches, stretching 330 feet across a dirt road nestled in a
large meadow beneath thew snowcapped Coast Mountains.
   Many protesters had lived in tents at the site since the
blockade began.

   A gunman believed to be of Arab descent
assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane after a speech at a hotel by the
Brooklyn-born extremist who demanded the ouster of all Arabs from
Israel, authorities said today.
   Kahane, 58, was shot to death Monday night after addressing a
Zionist group. The gunman, El Sayyid A. Nosair, 35, was shot and
wounded in the chin by a postal police officer as he tried to flee,
police said.
   Israel Army radio reported early today that Nosair once lived in
the occupied territories.
   Police said only that the gunman was believed to be of Middle
Eastern origin and that his nationality was not known. He was
believed to live in New Jersey, police said.
   Nosair was reported in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital,
where Kahane was pronounced dead.
   Kahane, as founder of the Jewish Defense League, had urged Jews
in the United States to arm themselves against anti-Semitism.
Later, as a member of the Israeli Parliament, he was one of
Israel's fiercest anti-Arab politicians.

   The environment, taxes and whether politicians should be turned
out of office before they get too comfortable in the job confronted
voters today as they tackled 236 ballot questions in 43 states and
the District of Columbia.
   Alaskans could make the private use of marijuana a crime,
Arizona voters could declare Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a
state holiday, and Oregon residents could give parents a $2,500 tax
credit for sending a child to the public, parochial or private
school of their choice.
   In California, Washington and Missouri, environmentalists looked
to the voters to adopt measures protecting forests, coasts and
other sensitive lands.
   The tax revolt faced an important Election Day as well. Citizen
initiatives that would cut or limit taxes or hold down government
spending were on the ballot in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oregon and
other states.

   TORONTO (AP) - The French-speaking province of Quebec,
determined to take charge of its political destiny, has begun a
serious self-examination to decide what its future relationship
with the rest of Canada will be.
   The failure of the Meech Lake accord four months ago, which
would have recognized Quebec as a ``distinct society'' within the
Canadian federation, was seen by many in the province as a
rejection by English Canada.
   Beginning today, a newly formed Commission on the Political and
Constitutional Future of Quebec takes up the question of the
province's fate. The creation of the 35-member commission is seen
by many Quebecois as a watershed in the province's history.
Relations with English Canada will never be the same.
   ``If the status quo were acceptable, there would be no
commission - that's the starting point,'' said Michel Belanger, one
of its chairmen.

   RENO, Nev. (AP) - When it comes to selling a brothel, the
Internal Revenue Service has a few hang-ups.
   Condoms and paintings of bare-breasted women are OK at next
week's tax sale of the Mustang Ranch. Dirty movies are out.
   Among the gaudier items to be sold when the auction of the
100-room bordello and its contents begins Nov. 13 are teddy bears,
pajamas, sequined and feathered gowns and pocket-sized ceramic
liquor bottles decorated with naked women.
   What's not for sale at America's best known legal brothel is a
small collection of porno flicks that were found in the purple,
mirror-walled Orgy Room when the IRS seized the property Sept. 21
for $13 million in back taxes owed by Joe and Sally Conforte.
   The IRS hopes to earn at least $1.8 million when the property
falls under the auctioneer's gavel.
   ``We highly encourage the neighborhood yard sale enthusiast to
come out and make a bid on anything they may want,'' Ms. Pagni
said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Pianist Leon Fleisher's tragedy was losing his
right hand to a crippling muscle disorder. His triumph was showing
the world that it hardly mattered.
   After building a new life for himself in the past
quarter-century as a conductor and teacher, Fleisher, 62, returned
to the concert stage last weekend for a bravura piano recital
featuring solo works for the left hand only.
   His homecoming performance in the Kennedy Center's crowded
Terrace Theater was praised by music critics with the same
enthusiasm that greeted his Carnegie Hall debut with the New York
Philharmonic in 1944, when he was a gangly 16-year-old from San
Francisco.
   Several works on Saturday night's program were written for other
great pianists who, like Fleisher, were unable to use their right
hands.
   It was Fleisher's first solo recital in a major concert hall
since he was stricken more than 25 years ago.

<HEAD>TV and Tobacco: Smoking and the Message of the Medium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not a Marlboro Man has galloped through the
intellectual wasteland since television banned cigarette
commercials in 1971, but California public health researchers say
there's still too much smoking on TV.
   Commercials are banned, but people still smoke: The grizzled old
cop fires up a grizzled old stogey; the troubled teen lights a
filter tip; the sneering gangster takes a puff on a coffin nail.
   Television, with its power to inform and entertain, also has aterrible
power to persuade, cajole and educate. What does it say
about smoking? Glad you asked.
   ``We wanted to assess the prevalence of smoking on television
and we wanted to look at who it is that is smoking, and the message
that is being given,'' said Patricia Madden, co-author of the study
of smoking on prime-time television.
   She and Georgette L. Overby are researchers at the Prevention
Research Bureau in Berkeley, Calif., one of a dozen state- and
federally funded centers for social and biomedical reasearch on
alcohol and other abused substances.
   The foundation of their experiment is the ``cognitive social
learning theory'' developed by the sociologist Albert Bandura and
others. It is, in essence, the Kid with a Stone theory of social
behavior.
   If the Kid sees somebody toss a stone through a window, the Kid
is likelier to do the same thing if the behavior is rewarded, and
somewhat less likely to do it if nothing happens.
   If the tosser is a ``high-status'' role model, someone who is
powerful, attractive, competent - a hero, for example - the Kid is
more likely to imitate the throwing than if the tosser is an
unattractive ``low-status'' model.
   Got it? Funny, it all seemed so clear when ``Andy of Mayberry''
was on.
   Ms. Madden said the researchers collected 139{ hours of
``routine, fiction network prime-time programming'' in the fall of
1989, and ended with a sample of 70 prime time shows, hours and
half-hours, comedies and dramas.
   University of California-Berkeley students then scanned the
programs, using a kitchen timer and the VCR's pause button to check
for smoking at minute-by-minute intervals.
   Once a ``smoking act'' was seen, the viewers noted the context
of the smoking - the status of the characters involved in the
smoking and how they reacted to it. The observers also checked for
embedded anti-smoking messages.
   The results were more surprising than you might expect.
   ``The scales are still tipped toward the pro-smoking message,''
Ms. Madden said. The study found an average 2{ minutes of smoking
per hour, with anti-smoking messages in little more than
three-quarters of a minute per hour.
   ``You'd have to watch two hours to see an anti-smoking
message,'' Ms. Madden said.
   Smoking occurred in 53 percent of all programs and 41 percent of
all episodes in the sample, while anti-smoking messages occurred in
39 percent of all programs and 20 percent of all episodes.
   Crime shows had more smoking on them, and the smokers tended
more often to be bad guys.
   ``We were encouraged by the fact that smoking does not tend to
be glamorized any more on television,'' Ms. Madden said, ``and we
would like to see scriptwriters weave more anti-smoking messages
into their plots.''
   Where anti-smoking messages were involved, the majority of
smokers and the people who reacted negatively to smoking were
adult, white male, plot-related characters, the study found.
   ``Overall, we had 129 smokers in our sample and 35 characters
who reacted negatively to smoking,'' Ms. Madden said. ``This could
be anything from waving away the smoke to actually saying something
to the character about their smoking.''
   In addition:
   -The negative ``reactors'' were more affluent than smokers,
likelier to be ``good guys'' and positive role models.
   -Smokers usually were guest characters and bad guys with ``low
role model potential.''
   -Fully 15 percent of smokers were under age 18.
   ``As a public health professional, I would not advocate the
total elimination of smoking on television,'' Ms. Madden said.
   ``I would like to see more of the consequences shown,
consequences ranging from someone asking a character to put out a
cigarette, to medical shows with episodes on cancer and
emphysema.''

<HEAD>Great Market for Homebuyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The time has come for some very patient families
who saved their money, bided their time and never lost faith that
someday they might be able to afford a house.
   Through most of a decade their vision could be only perceived
dimly. Prices soared and interest rates stayed high, and the market
was full of eager buyers to whom price seemed no object. It was a
seller's market.
   Those were tough times for people with limited incomes, and that
included millions of families. In many months, popular indexes of
affordability showed the typical family couldn't even qualify for
the typical single-family house.
   How things have changed. Home prices are dropping in many areas.
In some neighborhoods, the ``for sale'' sign on the front lawn has
become almost as common as the mail box on a post.
   Interest rates seem to be on a steady course lower. A survey of
125 primary mortgage-market lenders showed rates on a 30-year fixed
rate mortgage have dropped steadily to 10.17 percent and on a
one-year adjustable rate to 8.17 percent.
   Moreover, while some banks might be cutting back on lending to
businesses, many banks are aggressively seeking borrowers who offer
homes as collateral.
   At the same time, affordability has soared. The median home
price measured by the National Association of Realtors was down to
$94,300 in September from $97,100 in August, while the national
median income rose.
   Those changes put the association's affordability index at 110.9
in September, one of the highest in recent years. In the mid-1980s
it had fallen well below 100, meaning the typical family couldn't
afford the typical house.
   Translated, the September index meant a family earning the
national median income of $35,239 in that month had 110.9 percent
of the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering
80 percent of a median-priced home.
   It has been six to eight years in many sections of the country
since such favorable buying conditions existed, a long time in
terms of the economic cycle, and one that probably led some
would-be buyers to give up the search.
   Many buyers did remain patient, however, recognizing that the
most certain thing you can say about the economy is that it is
cyclical, rising and falling and rising again - and that the real
estate cycle is even more pronounced.
   The coalescing of favorable factors, however, does not make a
perfect market for buyers. In the nature of things, a shrinking
economy means less job security and more uncertainty, and the
latter is unusually high today.
   Prudent shoppers take that into consideration, of course, but
they realize also that no investment is without risk. Included in
their assessment of risk will be the cost of renting vs. buying and
relative tax benefits.
   In a market of sluggish sales, these tax benefits are one of the
more convincing sales inducements being used by real estate agents.
Deductibility of interest on mortgages, you might say, is the
common person's only ``loophole.''
   Prudence also dictates that buyers have a reserve of funds for
emergencies, of course, but also to pay for the various items that
may accompany the purchase of a home: furniture, drapes, lawn
mower, washing machine and more.
   Perhaps it isn't a perfect market for buyers; it never is. And
it is even conceivable that better buys might lie ahead. But those
who for years have postponed buying a house can at least begin
looking and planning now.

<HEAD>Japan To Enthrone First `Symbolic' Emperor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito formally assumes the world's oldest
hereditary throne Monday in lavish ceremonies that also may be an
important rite of passage for postwar Japan.
   No other monarch has ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne under the
constitution enacted in 1945.
   For the first time, a Japanese emperor is to be enthroned as
merely a national symbol, as stipulated by the constitution imposed
by the U.S. occupation after Japan's surrender in World War II.
   Most Japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial
role of their new emperor, a remarkable break with the past. The
late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, was enthroned as a living
god and was the object of fanatical devotion.
   Even the official name the government has given Akihito's reign
- Achieving Peace - reflects a desire to move away from the
turbulent times of Hirohito, who died of cancer early last year.
   The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese
public associates it most closely with Hirohito's 60-year reign. In
that period, Japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the
emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then
rose to become an economic superpower.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's
death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and
the growing of ``sacred'' rice for a coronation rite.
   During the interval, Akihito has tried to create a softer, more
open image for the often aloof royal family, insisting on fewer
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people
with the title ``san,'' a term of respect similar to Mr. or Mrs. in
English.
   Reflecting the different times in which they were raised,
Akihito is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his
father, and has pledged to ``protect the constitution along with
the people.''
   Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry a future Japanese
monarch, is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal
household, in large part by providing Akihito with a family life
similar to that of ``common'' Japanese.
   She broke tradition, for example, by making clear that her
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers.
   Although the palace remains distant to most Japanese, opinion
polls indicate it has wide public support. Few, however, still see
their monarch as a god.
   Government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age. They also have
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly month-long rites,
however, creating widespread concern that the ``new era'' might
actually represent a step backward in time.
   Royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150
nations will be in Tokyo when Akihito announces his accession on
Monday.
   The main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace, an
oasis of greenery in central Tokyo built in the late 19th century
on the site of a former samurai castle.
   Akihito will ascend a 20-foot-tall throne on a three-layered
dais of black lacquer, beneath an octagonal roof adorned with
golden mirrors and phoenixes.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will stand before the throne as
Akihito, in a reddish-brown kimono with a design of paulownia
trees, bamboo and mythical animals, reads an address announcing his
accession.
   Kaifu will lead the Japanese among the 2,500 guests in three
rounds of ``Banzai!'' - a traditional cheer for long life - to
conclude the 30-minute ceremony.
   Officials say Akihito will read his announcement in colloquial
Japanese, unlike Hirohito's use of stilted classical language most
Japanese cannot understand.
   To reflect the postwar constitution's emphasis on popular
sovereignty, Kaifu will lead the banzai cheers from a point level
with the throne instead of descending several steps, as his
predecessors did.
   An official in the prime minister's office told reporters a
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because ``that's the way foreign
dignitaries are received.''
   Aside from such cosmetic adjustments, Akihito's coronation is
expected to be much like those held since his great-grandfather
assumed the throne in the middle of the last century.
   In what many critics of the government see as a snub to the
constitution, about 2.5 billion yen ($17 million) in public money
will be spent on a rite steeped in Shinto, Japan's state religion
until 1945.
   In that rite, to begin 10 days after the main coronation
ceremony, Akihito will step back into the world of myth for a
``communion'' of fresh rice with the sun goddess, from whom the
imperial line is said to have descended, and all the gods of heaven
and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The Kaifu administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the late 15th century.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
Great Food Offering Ritual, is intended to restore living-god
status to Akihito and future emperors, Nobuo Ishihara, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor
assumed a divine nature. However, the government is not in a
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does
not.''
   Police have begun Japan's largest security operation, mainly
because ultra-leftist radical groups have said they will disrupt
the ceremonies. A bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last
week at a Tokyo police dormitory, killing one officer and wounding
six other people.
   Late last month, 26,000 Tokyo police officers were mobilized for
security in the capital, and at least 6,000 more will be brought in
before the main ceremony. Nearly 45 percent of the total coronation
budget of 12.3 billion yen ($94.6 million) is being spent on
security.
   A high-ranking National Police Agency official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the extraordinary security was
justified because leftist radicals ``are planning to attack the
palace with explosive rockets.''
   He said police believe one group has devised mortar-like weapons
with a range of nearly four miles.
   Along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries, including
Prince Charles of Britain and Vice President Dan Quayle, the police
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko are to ride in a convertible in the
30-minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal
residence at Akasaka Palace.
   Oficials say about 7,000 officers will line the three-mile
route.

   Clad in white robes reserved for the holiest
ceremonies, Emperor Akihito will complete his accession to the
throne by communing with the Shinto gods in a room bathed in
flickering torchlight.
   Palace officials say the communion, part of an enthronement
ritual more than 1,200 years old, has become an integral part of
imperial succession and is an important aspect of Japanese culture.
   It also has given rise to heated constitutional debate and
allegations that the government seeks to revive the ``living god''
status of former monarchs.
   Members of the leading opposition party, the Socialists, plan to
boycott the rite. The head of the Japan Federation of Bar
Associations has questioned its constitutionality and the National
Christian Council of Japan has collected nearly 80,000 signatures
on a petition against it.
   The ceremony, to begin just after dark Nov. 22 and end before
dawn, is known as the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual.
   About 900 Japanese dignitaries will gather for the ceremony at a
special complex of buildings recently completed on the grounds of
the imperial palace in central Tokyo. No foreigners are invited.
   Among the guests will be Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, speakers
of both houses of Parliament, the chief justice of the Supreme
Court and the cream of Japanese society.
   Ancient court music will be played as the guests are seated in
two large tents. A procession of chamberlains and palace officials,
clad in traditional kimonos, will escort the emperor to one of two
ceremonial halls.
   In a lantern-lit inner chamber, well away from the sight of the
guests, Akihito will be assisted by two female attendants as he
begins the rite.
   Sitting on a bamboo floor covered with rush matting, he will
pray and offer newly harvested and polished rice to the sun
goddess, from whom the imperial line is said to have descended.
   He then will join all the gods of heaven and earth in a
communion of rice, rice wine and produce from all over Japan,
including squid, abalone and chestnuts.
   Just after midnight, the ceremony will be repeated in the other
hall.
   Relatively few details of the mystical ceremony were known to
the public until earlier this century.
   Because each of the inner chambers contains a stylized bed,
scholars have argued that, at one time, the rite may have involved
the emperor symbolically having intercourse with the sun goddess,
thus becoming one with the divie.
   Palace officials say the bed represents the place where the gods
rest until summoned for the communion.
   Iwao Miyao, deputy head of the Imperial Household Agency, which
supervises palace affairs, told reporters recently that prayers
offered by previous emperors indicate the rite is not intended to
bestow divine status on the monarch.
   Miyao quoted a prayer by Emperor Gotsuchimikado in 1466 that was
an appeal to the sun goddess for peace, abundant crops and
blessings on ``all the people, both high and low.''
   He said that prayer and two others had, ``for some reason or
other,'' become known outside the palace. Miyao refused to divulge
what Akihito will say because ``such matters are intended
exclusively for the deities.''
   Akihito is to be the first monarch enthroned under Japan's
postwar constitution, written while Japan was administered by
Allied occupation forces after World War II.
   Although the charter redefined the role of the emperor from that
of ``sacred'' sovereign to a largely symbolic one, Akihito's
Daijosai will be essentially the same as those of his father,
grandfather and great-grandfather.
   Critics consider this important, since the content of those
rites was strongly influenced by those who wanted to restore
imperial rule and build a national cult of emperor worship.
   The cult was used later to rally the nation to war.
   Opponents also point out that the late Hirohito, the new
emperor's father, renounced his divinity in 1946. They claim
Akihito's Daijosai amounts to a retraction of that historic
decision.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria is more democratic a year after
a Politburo coup ousted Stalinist leader Todor Zhivkov, but it also
is a divided nation heading for economic disaster.
   Many Bulgarians were taken by surprise when Zhivkov fell Nov.
10, 1989, after 35 years in power. Dissidents and ordinary people
celebrated, but there has been little cause for rejoicing since.
   Exhorting Bulgarians into the streets of Sofia, the fledgling
opposition forced talks in January with the governing Communists,
who hurriedly began implementing reforms after Zhivkov was thrown
out.
   In June, as a result of the negotiations, Bulgaria held its
first free elections in 58 years. Instead of solving the nation's
problems, however, the elections seemed to create more.
   The Communist Party, now called the Socialists, became unique
among former masters in the Soviet bloc by winning at the polls.
The stunned opposition Union of Democratic Forces accepted the
result, but has seemed unable to live with it.
   Little has been accomplished in the 400-seat Parliament, where
theformer Communists have 211 members and the opposition alliance
144.
   It required six weeks for the assembly to chose a president,
former UDF leader Zhelyu Zhelev, and longer to approve an
all-Socialist government.
   Endless argument by deputies of the opposition alliance, and
divisions among the former Communists, have made it impossible to
pass legislation on foreign investment, selling state companies and
other economic and political reforms. UDF members refuse to support
Premier Andrei Lukanov or join a Socialist-led coalition.
   Although polls indicate the UDF would win if elections were held
now, many Bulgarians are critical of the opposition's conduct in
Parliament. Frustration, fear and tension have increased in the
streets.
   A mob burned the governing party's headquarters in September
after smashing windows and demanding the Communist red star be
removed from the roof.
   The charred walls and the empty mausoleum next door that once
housed the embalmed body of Communist founder Georgi Dmitrov -
removed and reburied in July - symbolize the collapse of Stalinism.
   Bulgaria's economy seems about to collapse with the old regime,
and Sofia is preparing for a bleak winter.
   Harvests were ruined by the driest summer in 32 years. Meat,
cheese, milk and even bread are rationed, and prices of available
goods rise steadily.
   Power cuts to factories and homes are routine. Industrial
production is down 30 percent from last year.
   Life is hardest for pensioners and the poor.
   ``These food lines, these prices; this is death for older
people,'' said Maria Ivanova, 64, waiting in a chill rain for a
store to open.
   ``We are eight people at home,'' said Stefka Savova, 61, who had
waited three hours to find only milk and rationed bread available.
``We have a 2-month-old baby there and they give us just five
cartons of milk. I don't have sausages, meat or cheese.''
   Mrs. Savova, a retired nurse with a monthly pension equivalent
to $14, said she had thought Zhivkov's fall was the beginning of a
brighter future.
   ``We expected things to get better, and they have gotten
worse,'' she said. ``I can do nothing ... only walk through the
streets and cry.''
   Legislators share the sense of helplessness.
   Parliament is ``incompetent and rather weak,'' said Dragomir
Draganov, a reform-minded deputy for the newly named Socialists.
   Instead of either uniting to govern or splitting into into
orthodox and reformist parties, he said, the Socialists have become
a deadlocked hybrid of Stalinists and Social Democrats.
   On the other side, the the 17-party Union of Democratic Forces
is united only in wanting the former Communists out of power.
   Political polarization and the coming winter ``create perfect
conditions for every populist,'' Draganov said, and a succesful one
``could liquidate even the small gains we have made on our way to
democracy.''
   Petyo Bluskov, editor of a new business-oriented weekly, 168
Hours, expressed the public impatience:
   ``What kind of moral respect can (deputies) win if they argue
for a week over what their salaries should be?'' he said.
   Opposition refusal to support the government's much-needed
economic reform program, or accept anything less than the
leadership of a coalition government, threatens to dash hopes of
economic recovery.
   Until the stalemate is resolved, foreigners have little reason
to invest in Bulgaria, a nation of 9 million with an obsolete
industrial plant that relied on now vanishing supplies from old
East European trading bloc.
   ``You know why you can't find beer in Bulgaria now?'' film
director Angel Wagenstein asked. ``Not because there is no beer.
Not because there are no btttles. We lack the tiny piece of plastic
inside the metal caps, which came from some other part of Eastern
Europe.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis has been a serious blow.
   Iraq used to pay installments of its $1.3 billion debt to
Bulgaria in oil. That has ceased and Soviet supplies, which must be
paid for with hard currency starting next year, are getting scarce.
   Bulgaria cannot afford to pay the higher prices on the world oil
market, and stopped payments on its $11 billion foreign debt in
May. In September, international creditors agreed informally that
debt payment resume only late next year.

<DATELINE>GORANDSI, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years ago, a folk music group
from neighboring Greece came to this ethnic Greek village in
southern Albania. The audience waited hours in burning heat, but
neither smiled nor applauded.
   A witness said the people turned out to demonstrate ethnic
identity, but dared not show emotion in the Albania of Stalinist
dictator Enver Hoxha.
   Hoxha died in 1985 and, by Oct. 26, 1990, things had changed.
   Foreign Minister Antonis Samaris of Greece was welcomed like a
20th century messiah when he visited Gorandsi and nearby
Derviciani, another ethnic Greek settlement. Thousands of people
surged past uniformed and secret police simply to touch or smile at
him.
   Albania's Communist rulers have given hints of reform and are
gradually losing control of the 3.2 million citizens they repressed
for half a century.
   Startling evidence of the change came in July, when thousands of
Albanians sought refuge at foreign embassies in Tirana, the
capital, and were allowed to emigrate.
   Outside pressure has grown for improvements in human rights,
particularly from the 2 million ethnic Albanians in neighboring
Yugoslavia.
   If it wants to rejoin Europe, as it says, Albania must lift the
ban on religion imposed in 1967, allow free speech and honor its
promise, made before the mass emigration, of passports for all
wishing to travel abroad.
   An illustration of the Communist leadership's dilemma was the
Samaras visit to a minority Albania says numbers 80,000 and Greece,
by including all the Greek Orthodox faithful, puts at more than
400,000.
   Trucks blocked the road to Gorandsi. Samaras stopped his
motorcade and insisted on his scheduled visit to 1,000 people who
awaited him in the dusk.
   Men from the Sigurimi, the Albanian secret police, were
sprinkled liberally through the crowds in both villages.
   In Derviciani, a senior Albanian official threatened to expel a
Greek journalist who was handing out Greek-language books to
children.
   A woman identified by Greeks as Veronika Kallas, emboldened by
the rare presence of foreigners, defied secret police to slip a
visa request to a Greek journalist. She said her husband was in
jail for trying to flee Albania.
   ``It shows you have not forgotten us,'' an excited teen-ager
said as the crowd showed Samaras the former Greek Orthodox church
of Gorandsi, now a dilapidated storehouse with a faded cross etched
in the stone portal. Donkeys grazed in the yard.
   A woman gestured her eagerness to pray. Jars with burned-out wax
on window sills of the warehouse attested to continued reverence
for the church.
   Officials contend religion always was alien to Albanians, that
the Moslem, Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox faiths were imposed
by occupying outsiders over the centuries. Recently, however, the
authorities removed religion from a list of anti-state propaganda.
   After religion was outlawed, many churches and mosques became
storehouses or ruins. Only a few are preserved as historical
monuments.
   Albania was the only European nation not to sign the 1975
Helsinki agreements on European security and cooperation, which
include comprehensive human rights provisions.
   It now wants to join the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which resulted from the Helsinki accords.
   Albania may have little idea of what such membership entails. It
has isolated itself from the West for two generations, broke with
Moscow in 1968 and with China in 1976.
   ``I tell government officials that joining Helsinki means
non-government organizations have the right to come here and ask
`Why is this church or mosque closed?' and to get an answer,'' said
a foreign official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They
simply don't understand what that means.''
   Samaras' criticism of the host country's human rights record,
delivered at a conference of Balkan foreign ministers in Tirana,
was omitted from Albanian media reports.
   Officials were clearly unnerved by having to deal with the 105
foreign journalists allowed in for the conference, and gently urged
the last eight to leave to do so before their visas expired.
   Government secrecy makes it virtually impossible to verify
numerous rumors of human rights violations.
   Reports of border shootings or torture often arise in Greece or
Yugoslavia. Both have an interest in painting Albania darkly, the
Greeks because of their minority in the country and the Yugoslavs
because of the restive ethnic Albanian majority in Serbia's Kosovo
province.
   Kosovo's Albanians are far freer than citizens of Albania,
despite being stripped of provincial autonomy by Serbia. Hunger for
cross-border contacts is increasing, and hundreds of people a day
apply for visas at the Yugoslav consulate in Tirana.
   In May, acknowledging international pressure for the first time,
the Albanian leadership published figures indicating only 35
political prisoners were held.
   Aleks Lasuari, a Tirana University legal expert, told reporters
the death sentence is reserved only for severe crimes, and that
only three or four people are executed each year.
   How Deputy Foreign Minister Sokrat Plaka handled the Samaras
trip is an example of the government's quandary.
   First, he insisted to a reporter that those in the enthusiastic
crowd around the visitor were complaining that Greece was not
issuing enough visas. Minutes later, he pointed at the smiling
faces and said: ``You see, people are happy here in Albania.''

   Joel Chaiken changes diapers, cleans house and
is the chief caretaker of his toddler son. He does everything the
other mothers in his Bronx neighborhood do. His problem is he's not
a mother.
   That's why he was banned from a local mothers-infant group,
which deemed his male persona, non grata.
   Chaiken, 32, tried to join the Riverdale Neighborhood House
support group last October when his son, Benjamin, was 7 months
old.
   ``I thought basically it was a place to go during the day and
meet new people; a place to find out about baby care - to find out
real information, the kind your pediatrician can't give you - a
place for Benjamin to socialize and a place for support, to a
certain extent.''
   Instead, he found a closed door.
   Chaiken is trying to pry it open by filing what is believed to
be a precedent-setting discrimination suit. The state Division on
Human Rights recently decided Chaiken's case has merit and has
ordered a public hearing.
   ``We found enough reason to believe he was treated differently
because he was a man,'' said Felicia Clavell of the state agency.
   Some in Riverdale's upper-middle class neighborhood some 11
miles north of midtown Manhattan say that's the way it should be.
   ``There are mothers and there are dads and he's not a mother,''
said Caryl Malka, 33, boiling the argument down to basics.
   ``I would feel very uncomfortable talking about personal things
in front of him,'' the two-time mother and former group member
said. ``It's not a play group, it's not just about the semantics of
scheduling or diapering ... It's women getting together and talking
about very intimate things and a man joining the group would really
change that.''
   Chaiken agrees, but he doesn't think that's negative.
   ``I think it would change for the better. Once they learn a real
man could be understanding and compassionate, their own
relationships might change.''
   ``Women don't have a monopoly on emotional support and
compassion toward others,'' said Chaiken's wife, Sue Ellen Dodell,
who encouraged her husband to file the complaint.
   Gender equality is important to the couple. That's evident in
the surname they chose for their child. It isn't one name or the
other, or a hyphenated version but an equal combination of the two:
Chaidell.
   It's also evident in the Chaiken-Dodell-Chaidell family's
toy-strewn living room, littered with everything from a diapered
baby doll to pickup trucks.
   Chaiken said they decided ``at conception'' that he would give
up his $37,000-a-year engineering job to care for their child.
Dodell, 35, is a lawyer for the city.
   His wife suggested he join the group after seeing an
advertisement in a local paper inviting ``mothers with babies up to
1 year old'' to come and ``relax with a cup of coffee and enjoy
each other's company while they care for their babies.''
   The ad said topics included ``easing the transition into
parenthood, new routines, infants' sleeping and eating habits,
talking to your pediatrician and choosing child care.''
   Chaiken attended an open house and told social worker Etty
Bar-Shai, who runs the group, that he was interested in joining.
``She said it was full and that I should check again in January,''
Chaiken said.
   The center limits the group to 10 members; there were four in
the group the semester Chaiken applied.
   He said he continued asking questions about the group but ``I
got the feeling she was uncomfortable.''
   The next day, Chaiken's wife called to ask about joining and was
told, ``Sure there's spots open, why don't you come in for an
interview.'' When he confronted Ms. Bar-Shai, she told him the
group was only for mothers.
   As a woman, Dodell said, ``I understand some may feel
uncomfortable at first but I think they should just give him a
chance and see. I really think they could benefit from his
perspective.''
   But that, she said, is the emotional side of the issue.
   Legally, she believes, the center is plain wrong. ``It's a place
of public accommodation and Joel should be permitted in the group,
period.''
   Riverdale Neighborhood House is a nonprofit center that receives
city and state funding for a variety of educational and support
programs.
   The state Human Rights agency agrees and will argue Chaiken's
viewpoint at an as yet unscheduled hearing, Clavell said.
   ``They placed an ad and said, `Come one, come all, join us.' But
when Mr. Chaiken took them up on the offer, they said, `Oh no, you
have to be a woman.' When you invite the public that includes
men,'' Clavell said.
   Donald Cohn, a vice president at the center and an attorney at
the high-powered, Park Avenue law firm of Webster &amp; Sheffield,
insists there was no discrimination.
   ``He took advantage of other programs at Riverdale House and he
was invited to participate in other programs,'' Cohn said. ``This
one was just not appropriate for him.''
   After the hearing, an administrative law judge will make a
recommendation and State Commissioner of Human Rights Douglas White
will issue a final order. The case may take longer than a year to
resolve.
   Chaiken realizes the decision will come too late to benefit
Benjamin, who at 19 months old is already happily ensconced in a
toddlers group, albeit not at Neighborhood House. Chaiken said he
was allowed to join the toddler group at the center but was already
committed to a different program.
   ``So why are we fighting on? We're fighting on because this
issue really has to be resolved,'' said Chaiken. ``It's really to
help future fathers who stay at home so they won't have to go
through this battle,'' Dodell added.
   Besides, they said, the decision may come in time for child No.

   The Big Three automakers' sales of North
American-made cars and light trucks rose 5.3 percent in late
October and were up 2.7 percent for the first month of the 1991
model year, confounding pessimistic economic news.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
Monday their car and light truck sales rose 5.3 percent to an
average daily rate of 34,009 in the Oct. 21-31 period, from a daily
sales rate of 32,302 in the same period last year.
   Car sales rose 8.4 percent while sales of light trucks edged up
0.5 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sales of existing homes from July through
September slipped 2.5 percent from their level a year earlier and
will remain slow in the first half of 1991 because of the weakening
economy, a real estate trade group said.
   The National Association of Realtors said Monday that sales of
previously owned homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.66 million units in the three-month period. Sales declined in the
year's two previous quarters as well.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - United Press International said it will be
forced into liquidation in less than two weeks unless union
employees of the news service accept a 90-day pay cut of 35
percent.
   A spokesman for the Wire Service Guild, which represents the
employees, said Monday that the union is recommending rejection of
the proposal.
   UPI last week said it was cutting management salaries 35 percent
for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from employees
represented by the guild to try to improve the company's financial
condition as it seeks a buyer.
   ---
   DETROIT (AP) - The United Auto Workers won a 35-hour workweek at
a St. Louis minivan plant in a new national contract, a provision
the union may seek nationwide, union President Owen Bieber said.
   The provision, which still must be voted on by members of a
local at the St. Louis plant, is included in a special section of
the tentative national labor contract between the union and the
nation's No. 3 automaker.
   ---
   BOSTON (AP) - General Cinema Corp., which has a majority share
in Neiman Marcus Group, called off a deal to buy remaining stock in
the specialty retailer less than a week after the offer was
announced.
   General Cinema said Monday it took the action because a special
committee of the Neiman Marcus board of directors had decided to
withdraw its recommendation supporting the $14.40 a share tender
offer.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Time Magazine announced a 6.5 percent rate boost
for a full-page, four-color advertisement in 1991 national
editions.
   The weekly magazine, one of the nation's largest, on Monday
attributed the hike to rising costs, including an expected postal
rate increase. The magazine said its last rate increase was four
years ago.
   The rate increase, effective in January will boost the price for
a four-color national ad to $128,000 a page, up from $120,310. That
type of ad accounts for about 55 percent of the magazine's ad
revenue.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A former stockbroker settled charges that he
illegally traded on information in advance copies of Business Week
magazine.
   John L. Petit, an ex-broker with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. in Newport Beach, Calif., was the 11th person charged by the
Securities and Exchange Commission with illicit trading involving
the weekly business magazine.
   Petit, who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., agreed Monday to pay
$195,528 in illegal profits, fines and interest to settle the
charges.
   ---
   GENEVA (AP) - The leading airline industry group recommended up
to an 8 percent increase in passenger fares and 7 percent rise in
cargo prices to help airlines offset high fuel costs caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The International Air Transport Association's recommendations,
issued Monday during its conference in Geneva, marked the second
time since the crisis began three months ago that the industry has
moved to raise prices because of fuel inflation.
   Any increase is subject to approval by affected countries.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Field Publications has settled charges it
mailed books to its subscribers that they had not asked for or
agreed to receive, and then billed them for payment, the Federal
Trade Commission said.
   Field, the publisher of Weekly Reader Books and other book
plans, said Monday it has acted to correct the shortcomings.

continuing hopes for lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrials rose 11.39 to 2,502.23 on top of last week's
54.70-point gain.
   The dollar fell sharply, reaching a new post-war low against the

   Outside contractors are demanding payment up
front and city employees are being urged to write on both sides of
their memos to save paper as Philadelphia totters on the brink of
insolvency.
   And if the city doesn't pay certain bills that are due, it's out
of toilet paper.
   Strangely, there is no panic among city workers. They say they
have felt all along a bailout will come from somewhere before the
paychecks stop and they must decide whether to work on faith alone
as Mayor W. Wilson Goode said he expects them to.
   Employees said in interviews they and their colleagues feel that
after Tuesday's elections for governor and state lawmakers,
Wednesday will be city-saving day.
   ``Until the election is over the Democrats and Republicans are
looking at that'' rather than the crisis, said John J. Shaw, head
of the police union. ``After the election they will look for
solutions and try to float the city again.''
   Officials expect the cash to run out sometime next month.
Besides the immediate cash flow problem, officials also project a
$207 million deficit at the end of the year and an even bigger one
the next year.
   Department heads are busy turning on immediate cost-cutting
moves such as turning off office machines that use up paper,
supplies and electricity while crafting contingency plans for the
day the checks bounce.
   Contractors and suppliers are demanding payment for new work up
front and businesses like toilet paper suppliers won't deliver
until back balances are paid.
   Just Monday, Episcopal Community Service said it was cutting off
services to new AIDS patients because the city has paid nothing on
a $300,000 June contract.
   ``It's a terrible choice to make,'' said the Rev. Gilbert Avery,
who is in charge of the service, which provides home meals and
transportation to and from doctors offices for up to 100 people.
   The 25,000 city workers have organized no outside job pools,
resume services or other emergency plans for themselves. Many say
they have considered the situation but see no reason to get too
excited.
   ``I've done most of my Christmas shopping, under the
circumstances,'' said Deputy Sheriff Donald Sicura.
   The police, the street cleaners, even the auditors who add the
numbers in City Hall cling to the belief that Philadelphia's fiscal
crisis will be resolved before December.
   Their faith is undeterred by Goode's repeated denial that no
secret rescue plan is in place and he has repeated his feeling that
city workers should come to work even after the cash runs out. In
September, city employees began finding letters in their pay
envelopes that said the city would be unable to meet its payroll
starting sometime in December.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week that a secret plan
already had been worked out and would be unveiled after Tuesday's
election. Goode again flatly denied any such plan.
   And he reiterated his claim that no full-scale state bailout is
necessary.
   ``Whatever pain we're feeling now, every other city will go
through the same pain,'' Goode said in a recent interview. ``And
we're going to recover faster and first and be stronger, longer, in
my view.''
   ``Philadelphia does not have a problem that is beyond the means
of its politicians to solve,'' he maintained.
   Not many believe the mayor's denial, saying it's all just
politics.
   In the meantime, in addition to cost-saving measures and delayed
payments to outside suppliers and contractors, overtime has been
cut off in most departments.
   Seasonal workers at Fairmount Park were laid off a month early.
The workers normally stay on until winter to help with trash
removal and help plant the city's yearly allotment of 60,000 to
70,000 bulbs.
   In the courts, 17 new judicial clerks missed a payday in
September after the city finance director ruled they arrived after
the city's hiring freeze Sept. 21. The clerks, hired at salaries
between $22,000 and $25,000, were kept on only after negotiations
between city officials and court administrators.
   Leon Walker, 55, a court officer for 13 years, is one of the few
city workers who would say he has made plans to deal with a pay
stoppage.
   ``Well, the thing is I done paid my rent a month in advance,''
he said last week as he ate his lunch on a bench outside City Hall.

   A city that today is mired in debt, litter
and social ills will become the envy of other major cities in the
years ahead, Mayor W. Wilson Goode says.
   Goode looked at Philadelphia's financial crisis with optimism
during a rare one-on-one interview recently and maintained
Philadelphia is even now moving into position as a role model.
   ``Whatever pain we're feeling now, every other city will go
through the same pain,'' Goode said. ``And we're going to recover
faster and first and be stronger, longer, in my view.''
   However, Goode said long-term solutions are still to be worked
out and, until they are, the city will continue to try to borrow
enough to avoid going broke.
   State involvement so far has been little more than a shadowy
presence, partially because of Tuesday's elections for governor and
the Legislature.
   Despite Republican campaign statements to the contrary,
Philadelphia does not seek or expect a state bailout, the mayor
contends. He also said he knows of no plan by Gov. Robert P. Casey
to provide one.
   Instead, Goode is looking for a little help from the state, like
changes in tax laws, rather than a wholesale takeover.
   ``Philadelphia does not have a problem that is beyond the means
of its politicians to solve,'' he maintained.
   He was also optimistic about loan opportunities. Investors
shunned the city's attempt to borrow $375 million in September and
Goode would not say by what means the city would try to borrow in
coming days.
   ``To say that might mean that the people who are working with us
might very well decid not to do it at this point,'' he said.
   The borrowing would be the first of a three-part solution, Goode
said. The other parts are to erase this year's deficit and create a
sound budget for the next fiscal year.
   The process could be influenced by Democrat Casey's re-election
bid against Republican Auditor General Barbara Hafer and contests
for half the seats in the state Senate and the entire state House.
   The Senate in Harrisburg has 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats.
The House has 103 Democrats, 99 Republicans and an empty seat.
   ``If the Democrats keep control over the state House and can
gain control over the state Senate, and if Bob Casey is re-elected
by a mandate margin, then I think that Philadelphia stands, in my
opinion, to gain a great deal from those elections,'' Goode said.
   If Casey wins and the power structure is unchanged in the House
and Senate, ``I think it will be more difficult to get a consensus
as to how best to deal with our problem,'' he said.
   If Hafer wins, the Democratic mayor said he expects a stalemate.
   One twist to the city's woes is that Goode, prevented by the
city charter from seeking a third term next year, is drawing some
of his most visible support since the 1985 armed standoff with the
MOVE cult and the police bombing of their headquarters that killed
11 people, including five children.
   Several businesses and non-profit institutions have prepaid
taxes and about 400 people attended a rally on his behalf at a
church.
   ``I think there are a lot of people out there who feel I've
become a victim of uncontrollable circumstances, and therefore want
to help me morally, financially and governmentally to solve the
problems,'' Goode said.

<HEAD>Automakers Say Late-October Car, Light Truck Sales Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late-October sales of North American-made cars
and light trucks managed an 8.5 percent increase from a year ago,
but some car dealers say many shoppers are just looking.
   For the full month, the first of the 1991 model year, car and
light truck sales were 5.7 percent higher than last October, the 10
major domestic makers said Monday.
   Foreign companies' U.S.-made car sales were up 33.8 percent in
the Oct. 21-31 period, while General Motors, Ford and Chrysler
accounted for a 5.3 percent increase.
   Some car dealers were dissappointed that the new 1991 models
didn't lure more people to their showrooms in October.
   ``They're just not in a buying mood,'' said George Turner, sales
manager at Bill MacDonald Ford in St. Clair, Mich.
   The news auto sale news came out days after the federal
government reported a decline in the Leading Economic Indicators
and a decline in employment.
   Sales of North American-made cars rose 12.1 percent in the Oct.
21-31 period while light truck sales rose just 2.4 percent, the
companies said.
   Auto analyst Mary Ann Sudol of Fitch Investors Service said the
lackluster performance of trucks could be a result of consumer
concerns about gas mileage.
   Overall sales topped last October's figures, which were down
sharply from a strong September when sales promotions to clear out
1989 model inventories bolstered sales.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
their car and light truck sales rose 5.3 percent to an average
daily rate of 34,009 in the Oct. 21-31 period from a daily sales
rate of 32,302 in the same period last year.
   Car sales rose 8.4 percent while sales of light trucks edged up
0.5 percent.
   For the first month of the model year, the Big Three reported
sales up 2.7 percent, with their car sales up 6.1 percent while
truck sales lagged 2.7 percent.
   For the first 10 months of the calendar year, sales of North
American-made cars and light trucks remained 3.8 percent behind
last year's, with car sales down 4 percent and trucks trailing by
3.4 percent.
   GM said its car and truck sales for late October were up 3.6
percent, with a 5 percent increase in car sales, and truck sales up
1 percent. GM said its vehicle sales were still down 4.3 percent
for the first 10 months of the year.
   Ford said its late-October vehicle sales were 10.5 percent ahead
of last year, with cars up 13.3 percent and trucks up 6.5 percent.
Ford said car and light truck sales still trailed 8 percent for the
year so far, however.
   Chrysler said late-October vehicle sales edged up 0.9 percent,
with a 10.1 percent rise in car sales overcoming an 8.2 percent
drop in sales of light trucks. Chrysler said its combined car and
light truck sales were down 13.8 percent for the year through Oct.
31.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for third period of October 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 27 selling days this year and 26
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 257 selling days
this year and 256 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant
cars.
   Mazda has begun selling sport-utility vehicles made in a Ford
plant in Kentucky.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>Trash Hauler Reaches $19.5 Million Settlement in Price-Fixing Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest trash hauler,
seeking to avoid costly court battles, has agreed to pay several
customers $19.5 million to settle civil claims of price fixing.
   Waste Management Inc. denied wrongdoing in reaching the
settlement. Subsidiaries from California to New York had been
targeted in federal antitrust investigations, and in several
markets where criminal charges were not brought the parent company
faced civil action, said spokesman William J. Plunkett.
   ``Our decision was made to avoid certain protracted and costly
litigation,'' Plunkett said on Monday.
   ``The plaintiffs were never able to develop any information even
suggesting antitrust conduct beyond the local markets to which our
settlement monies will be distributed,'' Plunkett said.
   ``We refused as a matter of principle to consider any payments
to a nationwide class, because we vigorously denied that there was
any impropriety of that scale.''
   The suit was brought by a group of customers led by Cumberland
Farms Inc., a Canton, Mass., convenience store operator. Waste
Management, based in Oak Brook, said the settlement received
preliminary approval Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania.
   The lawsuit contended that subsidiaries of Waste Management and
Browning-Ferris Industries, the second-largest trash hauler in the
country, conspired to fix prices for containerized waste disposal.
   Waste Management's settlement money will be distributed in 13
markets where antitrust investigations had been conducted. The
plaintiffs agreed to abandon all other claims against Waste
Management.
   Officials at Cumberland Farms could not be reached for comment.
   Antitrust investigations resulted in criminal charges in seven
markets against Waste Management subsidiaries.
   In December 1989, two subsidiaries of Waste Management pleaded
guilty to federal price-fixing charges in California and paid fines
totalling $1.5 million.
   In October 1987, subsidiaries of Waste Management pleaded guilty
to similar charges in Toledo, Ohio, and the company paid $1 million
in fines.
   Units of Waste Management also were convicted in 1984 in federal
district court in Atlanta of price fixing there.
   The settlements applied to cases in Toledo; Memphis, Tenn.;
Jacksonville, Orlando, and Dade and Broward counties, Fla.;
Phoenix; Atlanta; Rochester, N.Y.; three counties in southern
California; and a market encompassing several counties in northern
New Jersey.

<HEAD>Pitney Bowes Announces Layoffs of 100 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pitney Bowes Inc. says 100 workers at its
distribution center will lose their jobs by early December as part
of a decision to stop refurbishing used copier equipment.
   The $2.9 billion office products company employs 350 workers at
its Newtown site. The remaining 250 workers will continue with the
company's istribution division, spokesman Terrence Marable said
Monday.
   Pitney Bowes, based in Stamford, said in September it would no
longer remake used copier equipment, deciding instead to
concentrate on new, higher-margin copiers for large corporations.
   The Newtown plant was the only site where the company
refurbished used copier equipment for resale, Marable said.
   Pitney Bowes, struggling under declining revenues, adopted a
three-year reorganization plan last December.
   The company said then it would cut 1,500 jobs from its payrolls
over the next three years. Some employees were offered a severance
package consisting of two weeks pay for each year of service or 75
percent of their annual salary, whichever was greater.
   In May, George B. Harvey, chairman and chief executive officer,
said 1,040 workers chose to take a severance package and leave the
company this year.
   Another 500 jobs were targeted for elimination through attrition
and other initiatives, a spokesman said.
   For the nine months ended in September, Pitney Bowes earned
$131.9 million on sales of $2.33 billion, down from earnings of
$243.3 million on sales of $2.06 billion for the same period in
1989.
   Net income last year was boosted by an accounting change, and
the 1990 figures included a one-time third quarter restructuring
charge of $86 million.
   In addition to copiers, Pitney Bowes makes mailing, shipping,
dictating and facsimile systems, as well as mailroom and related
management services.
   It employs about 30,000 workers worldwide.

<HEAD>Report: Prudential-Bache Securities Lays Off Two-Thirds of
Investment Bankers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is laying off
at least two-thirds of its investment bankers and the head of its
investment banking division has resigned from that post, a
published report said today.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that in laying off about 120 of
its 180 investment bankers, the brokerage firm is effectively
ending its four-year effort to become a major investment bank.
   Separately, reports in the Journal and The New York Times today
said Prudential-Bache was expected to settle several pending
disciplinary cases with the New York Stock Exchange.
   A spokeswoman for the firm, Eleanor Mascheroni, said she wasn't
able to comment on the report of personnel moves, and said it was
premature to comment on the disciplinary cases.
   In its story on the planned layoffs, the Journal said James F.
Crowley has resigned as head of investment banking at the firm but
will continue as a senior officer.
   Prudential-Bache spent heavily four years ago to shore up its
investment banking business and become one of the nation's biggest
investment banking firms by 1989. The brokerage had been geared
toward small investors.
   But the Journal said Prudential-Bache chairman George Ball said
in an internal memorandum on Oct. 22 that the firm needs to cut
1991 costs by $100 million and singled out the investment banking
department.
   ``First, the Investment Bank is hurting on the bottom line and
we intend to scale it to a size where it'll be profitable in
1991,'' Ball wrote.
   Pudential-Bache lost $51 million overall last year.
   In the first nine months of the year, Prudential-Bache ranked
42nd on Wall Street in total value of completed deals such as
mergers, spinoffs and stock repurchases and was in the top 20 in
the number of completed deals, according to Securities Data Co.
   The Journal and the Times each reported that one of the cases
the firm is expected to settle with thew NYSE is related to a
Securities and Exchange Commission action the firm settled last
year in which it was censured for incorrectly monitoring about $200
million in customers' securities.
   Prudential-Bache has said that customers weren't harmed by the
monitoring problems.

<HEAD>Last of Big Three Contracts Set for Ratification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers' Chrysler bargaining
council has approved a new contract with the automaker that
includes a 35-hour workweek for workers at a minivan plant.
   The new union contract includes a provision that will allow the
35-hour workweek for 3,500 workers at Chrysler's St. Louis minivan
plant.
   ``That is a plum we were very happy to pluck off the tree,'' UAW
President Owen Bieber said Monday. ``Certainly it is something we
would look at with great delight in the future.''
   The union's Chrysler bargaining council voted overwhelmingly
Monday to submit the tentative contract reached last Tuesday for
rank-and-file ratification among about 63,000 hourly and salaried
Chrysler workers. That process is expected to be completed within
two weeks.
   Last May, at the UAW's bargaining convention, Bieber and other
union officials said they planned to negotiate nearly identical
terms for each of the Big Three contracts.
   The contract is similar to UAW agreements signed last month with
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. In all, more than 450,000
active workers are covered by UAW agreements with the Big Three.
   Chrysler has been looking for ways to boost production at its
St. Louis II and Windsor, Ontario, minivan plants for more than a
year. The minivan is Chrysler's hottest-selling vehicle - more than
300,000 have already been sold this year.
   A year ago, the company and the UAW leadership tried to get
members of Local 110 to accept a scheduling scheme that would have
included three crews working two shifts, boosting production by
about 20 percent.
   The workers overwhelmingly rejected that idea, saying it ate
into their overtime. That concern could be wiped out by the 35-hour
week for 40 hours of pay.
   The tentative agreement will let the 3,500 workers at the St.
Louis II plant vote to change their scheduling plan within 120 days
of contract ratification.
   Otherwise, in July 1991, the factory will change to a
three-shift operation Monday through Friday with two nine-hour
production shifts on Saturdays if the company chooses. The Saturday
shifts will be paid at the full overtime rate.
   Elsewhere, the Chrysler contract contains many of the same
provisions as the GM and Ford agreements, including a commitment to
guarantee full pay for employees laid off for more than 36 weeks at
factories closed because of slumping sales.
   GM committed about $4.1 billion and Ford said it would pay up to
$1.6 billion for the same program. Chrysler's commitment is about
$659 million.

   The stock market fell slightly this morning,
amid concerns of possible war in the Persian Gulf and modestly
rising oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.66 to 2,492.57
in the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.95 million shares as of 10

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 376 up, 583 down and

   Analysts said the market was watching the behavior of interest

interest rates and reduce demand for stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks climbed
.74 to 170.75. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .06 at 291.52.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.39 to

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 on the

   International Paper Co. said Tuesday it has
agreed to buy the graphics business of Cookson Group PLC of the
United Kingdom for about $215 million.
   International Paper, based in suburban Purchase, N.Y., said it
was buying Cookson Graphics, a global supplier of lithographic
printing plates, press-room chemicals and plate processing
equipment to the commercial printing industry.
   Cookson Graphics employs about 1,600 people and has
manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdomn, Germany and the
United States. Its sales are expected to amount to about $300
million this year.
   International Paper, a leading producer of paper and forest
products, said Cookson Graphics' product lines will complement the
photosensitive papers and films made and sold by its Anitec
division and boost the company's sales in imaging products to more
than $900 million a year.
   International Paper earned $864 million, or $7.72 per share, on
sales of $11.4 billion in 1989.
   Cookson Group, based in Leeds, England, is an industrial
materials company.

<HEAD>Suits Accusing Airlines of Price Fixing Consolidated in Atlanta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge in Atlanta has been chosen to
hear a consolidated lawsuit alleging collusion and price-fixing
among several of the nation's air carriers and their computerized
fare network.
   The suit, formed when 31 claims filed across the country were
consolidated Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia, alleges that the airlines signal fare changes
to each other, agree on price increases and threaten fare cuts via
computer.
   Defendants in the case are USAir, Northwest, Delta, Continental,
United, TWA and American airlines and the Washington-based computer
clearinghouse that links them, Airline Tariff Publishing Co. They
deny wrongdoing.
   The suit charges that, as a result of the alleged collusion,
passengers are forced to pay artificially high ticket prices.
Anyone who purchased a plane ticket since 1987 could potentially be
a party in the suit.
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Marvin H. Shoob
when a panel of federal judges from around the nation decided
Friday that Atlanta was easily accessible to all parties in the
suit.
   If Shoob certifies the lawsuit as a class action, a decision
expected early next year, the plaintiffs could number in the
millions.
   It could be the largest civil litigation ever ``in the history
of Atlanta, if not the largest in the United States,'' said W.
Pitts Carr, the Atlanta attorney who filed the first suit here last
July.
   ``In 1988, 150 million tickets were sold, so that would give you
a rough idea of the possible magnitude of this case,'' he said.
``There are literally tens of millions of people or companies who
are potential class members.''
   The defendants deny any collusion.
   ``Delta denies totally the allegations ... concerning our
participation in any conspiracy to fix prices,'' said Edward B.
Krugman, one of the airline's attorneys.
   The suit asks for undetermined damages that could be tripled
under federal antitrust laws. It also asks that the airlines be
restrained from further violation of antitrust laws and that the
computer network be ``restructured so as to discourage future
collusion among airlines.''

<HEAD>EC Commission Frees Imports Of U.S. Solvent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission said
Tuesday it was satisfied that imports of an organic solvent from
the United States would not threaten the trade bloc's chemical
industry.
   In a statement, the Commission said that U.S. manufacturers of
the solvent called propan-1-ol would no longer have to set a
minimum price on their product in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   Propan-1-ol is used as a solvent in the printing and
pharmaceutical industries, and as an intermediary agent in the
manufacture of pesticides.
   Following a complaint from the Council of the European
Federation of Chemical Industries, the Commission began an inquiry
into whether foreign manufacturers were dumping propan-1-ol on the
European market at unjustifiably low prices in 1983.
   U.S. producers, including Eastman Kodak Co. and Union Carbide
Corp., subsequently agreed to set a minimum price on the chemical
for five years, ending in 1989.
   At the end of 1988, the council asked the commission, on behalf
of EC's sole propan-1-ol maker, BASF AG of Germany, to investigate
again the impact of the imports on free trade.
   The Commission concluded that imports of U.S-made propan-1-ol
had been cut by nearly half over the five-year period, to 4,428
metric tons in 1989 from 8,738 tons in 1983, and no longer
constituted a threat to EC manufacturers.
   ``The profits made by the plaintiff industry have risen to a
level where they must be considered satisfactory,'' the Commission
said.

   Wall Street's leading commodity markets gave
economically battered New York a welcome respite today, promising
to stay in the financial center after threatening to leave for a
cheaper bigger home in New Jersey.
   The decision by the four exchanges, which trade items ranging
from crude oil to cocoa to gold, was announced after an all-night
bargaining session with New York city and state officials who gave
the exchanges a generous package of tax breaks, land and other
incentives to build a new home here.
   ``It is clear this is a long-term investment in the economic
future of our city that we believe is worth making,'' Mayor David
Dinkins told a news conference. ``This vote in the confidence of
the future of our city is so very important.''
   The announcement is a relief for the city, which is confronting
an overall economic decline incited by a devastating recession on
Wall Street that has persisted since the stock market crash three
years ago.
   Thousands of people have been laid off in the financial
district, which also is home to the New York and American stock
exchanges. Moreover, the city is once again facing a looming
financial crisis of its own reminiscent of the dark days when it
verged on going broke in the 1970s.
   The four commodity exchanges, on the other hand, have been
straining to expand in order to compete with rival exchanges in
Chicago and elsewhere. The New York commodity exchanges employ
about 12,000 people, a figure that is expected to rise sharply in
coming years in the battle for domination of that business. They
had threatened to leave the city unless they could work out an
attractive deal to move into bigger quarters.
   Dinkins said exchanges generated more than $1.3 billion in
economic activity annually and produce $165 million a year in city
and state taxes, even with all the abatements. He said the overall
package will not significantly affect the city's own budget crisis.
   Under the deal, New York state and city will provide a total of
$145 million in incentives for the four exchanges to relocate from
their cramped quarters at the World Trade Center to a new building
to be constructed on an empty plot nearby, to be completed in four
years.
   The total cost of the project was not determined, officials
said, but the new trading floor alone is expected to cost of $225
million. The new site will triple the size of the exchanges' total
floor space to 1.2 million square feet.
   The heads of the exchanges told the news conference they'll
recommend to the membership that they move to the new site.
   The exchanges had considered moving to the Harborside Financial
Center in Jersey City, N.J. Their decision to remain in New York
was unanimous.
   ``Although we seriously considered a move to ... Jersey City, we
believe that the long-term needs of the exchanges wil be best
served by staying in New York City,'' the exchange leaders said.
   ``At our new home in the heart of New York's financial district,
the exchanges will have the space, the flexibility and the
state-of-the-art technology we sorely need ...''
   Jersey City Mayor Gerald McCann was not immediately available
for comment. The city's offices were closed for election day, and
the mayor did not return a message left on his home telephone
answering machine.
   Members of the exchanges will be asked to ratify the decision in
December. If they fail to do so, the exchanges will remain at the
World Trade Center.
   The exchanges involved are the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
Inc., established in 1882 and the world's leading market in those
commodities; the Commodity Exchange Inc., established in 1933 and
the world's most active metals market; the New York Cotton
Exchange, established in 1870 and the world's only raw cotton and
citrus market; and the New York Mercantile Exchange, established in
1872 and the world's dominant energy market.

   Tonight's prime-time election specials on the
CBS and NBC television networks won't be sponsored, although ABC's
coverage will have commercials.
   The one-hour NBC special and CBS' two hours of election night
coverage in prime time will be carried as ``sustaining,'' or
unsponsored, representatives of both networks said.
   This means the CBS and NBC broadcasts won't be counted in the
current November ratings ``sweeps,'' one of four key ratings
periods each year that help network affilliates set their local
advertising rates.
   Both NBC and CBS will use the time, however, to promote shows
they're broadcasting as the sweeps period continues this month.
   NBC acted after CBS decided against seeking sponsorship for its
election night program, said an NBC executive who asked not to be
identified. It took that step because of the tight prime-time
ratings race of all three networks this season, the executive said.
   If NBC's coverage was sponsored and included in Nielsen ratings,
low viewing levels the networks expect on election night might pull
down NBC's overall ratings average for this week.
   NBC again is first in prime-time ratings this season, but its
margin over second-place CBS is small.
   According to ratings averages for the season through last
Sunday, NBC has a 13.3 ratings average, CBS a 13.0 and ABC a 12.5.
Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.

   Several months ago Bob Israeloff sat down with
the president of a Long Island high-tech manufacturer who was
looking for a new auditor.
   The account would have generated $75,000 a year in fees for
Israeloff, Trattner &amp; Co., a mid-sized accounting firm. But after
carefully reviewing the company's financial statements, he turned
the executive down.
   It wasn't the first time a potential client sent up red flags in
Israeloff's mind. Like a growing number of accountants, he was
worried that doing business with the company might result in
malpractice charges.
   Lawsuits targeting accountants - filed by businesses challenging
audits or shareholders claiming to have received faulty financial
information - are on the rise, and the threat of litigation is
having a chilling effect on the profession.
   According to a recent survey by the New York insurance broker
Johnson &amp; Higgins, four out of five certified public accountants
have cut back on the services they provide. The poll of 500
accountants nationwide also showed that 56 percent have ceased
doing business with clients considered at ``high risk'' for
initiating lawsuits, and 98 percent ask clients to sign protective
contracts before work begins.
   Allen Berger, a partner in Chicago-based Blackman Kallick
Bartelstein, said his firm declined an invitation to bid on
auditing a savings and loan. ``The thought of having your name in
the newspapers just wasn't worth the return,'' he said.
   While S&amp;Ls top the list of businesses being shunned, the survey
showed many accountants are steering clear of start-ups and
companies considering initial public offerings as well.
   Fear of litigation comes at a time when accounting firms are
squeezed for cash. Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the nation's seventh
largest accounting firm, recently said it was under so much
financial pressure that it was cutting the pay of its nearly 3,500
employees by 10 percent for three months.
   Philadelphia-based Laventhol blamed the cuts on a deteriorating
economy. But the firm also has been hurt by unfavorable settlements
and judgments - only some of which were covered by insurance -
stemming from lawsuits challenging the quality of its audits.
   Laventhol went to trial last month in North Carolina over the
auditing of Jim Bakker's PTL ministry. The suit, which also named
Deloitte &amp; Touche, charged the firms oversaw a secret bank account
that was used to pay Bakker and others millions in bonuses. The
trial is still under way.
   Deloitte has had its own problems. This summer the firm agreed
to pay Inter-Regional Financial Group, an audit client, $19.75
million to end a 1986 lawsuit challenging its audits.
   Experts say some private settlements have reached the
$100-million mark, and more may be on the horizon. Federal
regulators have brought nearly $1 billion in suits against major
firms that audited failed thrifts.
   Time was when ``accountants pretty much accepted whoever walked
in the door and didn't think much about liability problems,'' said
Israeloff, executive partner of the Long Island firm that bears his
name.
   ``But today, because of the economy, the S&amp;L fiasco, the
depressed real estate market, plaintiffs are striking out against
accountants all over the place,'' he said.
   Israeloff turned down the Long Island high-tech maker after
discovering the company had had two auditors in the past three
years; long-term relationships with accountants are the norm.
   In addition, ``it was a public company, which increases the odds
of outside parties suing you'' because financial statements are
more widely circulated, Israeloff said. Many suits are brought by
third parties who relied on accountants' work when making
investment decisions.
   Finally, the company was not particularly healthy. ``If a
company is not doing well, unfortunately people are going to blame
the auditors even though we have nothing to do with'' how the
company is run, he said.
   Indeed, Jim Williams, who is representing Deloitte in the PTL
trial, has said his client ``was not in the crystal ball business,
nor should it have been.''
   Shareholder attorneys have little empathy. Arthur Abbey, a New
York lawyer who specializes in suing accounting firms, told the New
York Times earlier this year that in these very rough times,
``accountants are very often the ones who know - or should know -
what's going on.'' Abbey did not return calls to The Associated
Press.
   The key to avoiding lawsuits is screening clients carefully,
said Philip Zimmerman of the New York firm Paneth Haber &amp;
Zimmerman.
   Without revealing how many times his firm has been sued since it
was formed 25 years ago, Zimmerman said he has settled only five
cases and has won ``many more,'' none of which had gone to trial.
   Scott Rhine, of the Boca Raton, Fla.-based firm Rhine, Johnson &amp;
Co., said his firm has been able to ``lessen our risk by becoming
niche-oriented.'' The firm evolved away from auditing to
specializing in tax services.
   Accountants blame the plethora of lawsuits on a perception that
they have deep pockets. The corollary - though undocumented - is
that not having insurance may be the best protection against
litigation.
   ``They don't want your house, they want money,'' one accountant
said of those who sue professionals.
   Suits targeting accountants are expected to increase as the
recession deepens. Malpractice insurance provides CPAs with an
essential comfort level, but it comes at a high price.
   In the mid-1980s, Israeloff was paying about $30,000 a year for
$7 million in coverage. Today he's shelling out $200,000 for $5
million in coverage, and his deductible has risen considerably.
   Liability insurance usually is a firm's No. 3 cost, behind
compensation and rent. Annual premiums can consume up to 5 percent
of a firm's total fees and perhaps as much as 25 percent of
partners' pre-tax profits.
   Most accountants say they will need increased insurance
protection in the coming years, and clients ultimately will pay for
it.
   Accountants may be growing more wary of their clients, but no
one suggests that the day will come when a company will find itself
unable to secure an auditor. There is always someone willing to
take on the job.
   But accountants do agree that the best firms probably won't take
on the riskiest work.

   The thought of being held liable for the deeds
of others is enough to make anybody nervous. When it comes to
tempermentally conservative accountants, they're shivering in their
boots.
   Because most state laws require accountants and their firms to
operate as private partnerships, they are deprived of the limited
liability enjoyed by corporations. That puts a partner's personal
net worth on the line every time a lawsuit is filed.
   It would not be unheard of, under current law, for a certified
public accountant in Texas to be held accountable for an audit
conducted by a partner in his firm's Boston office - a partner the
Texas CPA may not have known.
   ``Most practicing accountants would consider the risk of legal
liability one of the largest concerns facing the profession and
themselves individually,'' said Bob Mednick, a partner in Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co.'s Chicago headquarters and chairman of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' legal liability
committee.
   Under general partnership laws, ``if the assets of the
partnership are not sufficient to satisfy a judgment, then the
plaintiff can go after the personal assets of individual partners,
including those who don't even know the plaintiff is a client,''
Mednick said.
   The issue is becoming more critical as lawsuits against
accountants mount. Arthur Bowman, who publishes an Atlanta-based
industry newsletter, estimated that partner income fell $25,000
from an average $135,000 at Laventhol &amp; Horwath because of rising
litigation and settlements.
   Members of the AICPA will soon be asked to vote on amending the
group's code of professional conduct to allow accounting firms to
function as limited liability corporations.
   Ballots are to be mailed out early next year to the group's
300,000-plus membership. Although about 50 percent work for
corporations, the government or in academia and therefore are
unaffected by the liability issue, it is widely anticipated the
vote will pass.
   But a favorable vote will only serve as ammunition to be hurled
at lawmakers, who will have to amend their own state statutes to
permit the change, Mednick said.
   ``Hopefully this vote will act as a catalyst to achieve change
at the state legislative level,'' he said. Even after laws are
changed, it would be up to individual accountants and firms to
comply.
   No matter how unfavorable state laws appear, they only mirror
accountants' own creed. Decades ago, long before litigation became
an issue, accountants instituted a professional code that held them
personally liable for their work.
   Accountants vouch for the accuracy of financial statements used
by the public, ``and the thought was that we want to tell the
public we stand by our work all the way down to our personal
assets,'' Mednick said.
   In these litigious times, that desire has come back to haunt
them.
   Like banks that have had to establish reserves to cover bad
Third World loans, some accounting firms are setting aside funds to
pay for the uninsured portions of any judgments against them.

   Striking workers of the Daily News got a boost
from local and national labor leaders who pledged $2 million to
help the paper's unions.
   Management, meanwhile,worked to continue to publish the tabloid
as more newsroom workers wavered over whether to break with the
nine unions which have been on strike for nearly two weeks. A 10th
union, of typographers, has stayed on the job.
   And the News asked minority journalists' organizations for help
in recruiting permanent replacements for strikers.
   Nine unions representing groups from Teamsters to teachers
agreed Monday to assist the strikers at the nation's third-largest
daily with a $2 million loan.
   ``We need it to go out on radio and TV and fight the enemy,''
said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, a coalition of unions at the News.
   The strike began Oct. 25. About 2,000 people are on strike,
although some have returned in various departments staffed by
members of the Newspaper Guild, which represents reporters,
photographers and other workers.
   At least two editorial workers left the paper Monday for the
second time, but seven other workers of the 350-member editorial
department crossed picket lines. News officials said about 150
members of the Guild have returned.
   Daily News Editor James P. Willse wrote letters to the National
Association of Black Journalists and similar Hispanic and
Asian-American groups, saying 50 permanent workers are needed for
the newsroom, The New York Times reported today.
   Thomas Morgan, a Times reporter who heads the black group, said
his organization had agreed to give the News its mailing list but
would not ``take a position on who is the guilty party in this
strike.''
   Circulation figures provided by the News have been widely
disputed as editors have worked to get the paper out with new
hires, returning workers and reporters and editors from other
papers owned by the News' parent, the Tribune Co.
   News management sources speaking on condition of anonymity said
the paper printed 600,000 copies Sunday, down from its normal
Sunday run of 1.4 million.
   A source at a rival newspaper, also speaking anonymously, said
its circulation people estimated the News distributed only 257,000
copies.
   ``They were really hard to find on Sunday,'' the source said,
adding that newsstand availability had been holding up until
midweek. ``I think it all fell apart.''
   Newsstands and delivery trucks have been vandalized during the
strike, and the News said newsstand operators have been threatened
not to carry the paper.

   United Parcel Service Inc. has ordered 25 Boeing
757 jet freighters, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said Tuesday.
The total value of the order, including spare parts, is about $1.7
billion.
   Fifteen of the orders were converted from options UPS previously
held for the twin-engine, mid-sized jets.
   UPS now has 55 757PFs in its fleet or on order, and holds
options for an additional 41. The planes ordered Tuesday are to be
delivered through 1997.
   The 757PF is a windowless version of the 757 jetliner, set up
for package freight. The plane has a large cargo door on its
forward left side and its main deck is designed to accommodate 15
cargo containers or pallets.
   In the past year, UPS has purchased 23 other jet aircraft from
various sources, and by the end of the year will have 121 jets in
its fleet.
   ``Our commitment to fleet expansion during the past 12 months
has been greater than in any year since UPS began its air
service,'' said Dick Oehme, president of the UPS airline.
   Greenwich, Conn.-based UPS is the largest package-delivery
company in the world, serving all 50 states and more than 180
countries and territories.

   Gasoline pump prices fell slightly over the past

survey on Tuesday.
   AAA said the lower national average price marked retail
gasoline's first decline since the week of Sept. 18, when the pump
price dipped 0.2 cent a gallon.
   Despite this week's decline, the average price is still 30.2

sent oil prices spiraling upward, according to the AAA survey.
   Prices were slightly higher in New England and the Great Lakes

<HEAD>Emerson Posts Higher Profits for Fourth Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emerson Electric Co. on Tuesday reported a 3.3
percent rise in fourth-quarter profits and record profits for its
33rd consecutive year.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company had net earnings of
$154.6 million, or 69 cents a share, up from $149.6 million, or 67
cents a share, in last year's final quarter.
   Sales were $2.03 billion, up 15.7 percent from $1.76 billion for
the 1989 fourth quarter.
   For the year, Emerson had net earnings of $613.2 million, or
$2.75 a share, up 4.3 percent from the $588 million, or $2.63 a
share, in fiscal 1989.
   Sales for fiscal 1990 increased 7.1 percent, to $7.57 billion
from $7.07 billion.
   ``These results were achieved in a domestic economic environment
that became increasingly difficult as the year progressed,'' said
Charles Knight, chairman and chief executive officer. ``We view the
economic outlook for fiscal 1991 with a great deal of caution.''
   Knight said the deteriorating economy has hurt the sale of
Emerson's consumer products, such as tools and ceiling fans, along
with the demand for appliance components and computer equipment.
   ``The weakening domestic economy highlighted the international
strength of the company as international sales grew by more than 30
percent,'' Knight said.
   However, Knight cautioned that higher oil prices may make
further growth in foreign sales more difficult.
   Emerson, headquartered in St. Louis, makes electric motors and
uninterrupted power supplies and compressors for refrigerators. It
also owns companies that make tools for Sears Roebuck Co., Skil
power tools, ceiling fans, ladders and other consumer products.
   In September, the company completed a plan to spin off five
defense-related subsidiaries into a separate company in order to
exit the defense business. Defense products had comprised about 10
percent of Emerson's annual sales.

<TEXT>
   London's Stock Exchange confirmed Tuesday it was
investigating more than a dozen suspected ``bear raids'' in which
stock manipulators illegally profit by spreading malicious rumors
about companies.
   ``It is certainly true that there have been a growing number of
complaints,'' said a stock exchange spokeswoman who was not
identified, in accordance with exchange practice.
   ``What we have to do is investigate to see if there is a
foundation in those allegations,'' she said.
   Polly Peck PLC and Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Co.
are among the companies whose share trading is being investigated
by the exchange, company and exchange sources said anonymously.
   Polly Peck's administrators declined to comment, although
chairman Asil Nadir has blamed his company's recent spectacular
collapse on false rumors. Polly Peck, which owns the Del Monte
fresh fruit and Sansui hi-fi businesses, is now in the hands of
court-appointed administrators after its share price plummeted 55
percent in one day.
   Peninsular &amp; Oriental said it had no comment other than that
recent rumors about the shipping and property company have been
false. The company's shares fell sharply two weeks in October on
rumors that the company was selling new stock to sha with the rumor that
the chairman has been
assassinated or has died, it certainly has an impact on the
company's shares,'' Nadir said.
   While such rumors existed, the market also was disturbed by the
news that Nadir was interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office the
same day and that the fraud office had raided a Nadir-linked
company the previous day.
   Nadir, who has denied any wrongdoing, said it was common
knowledge that illegal bear raids go on ``constantly'' and that it
was ``more than a suspicion.''

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 9.90 at 2,492.3

   Decliners barely outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 708 up, 714 down and

<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. said Tuesday it
received a $1 million grant from the state of Illinois to develop
new manufacturing processes for high-definition television
monitors.
   The grant from the Illinois Technology Challenge Grant Program
will augment Zenith's $50 million commitment to HDTV, the emerging
television technology on which the last U.S. consumer television
maker is betting its future.
   High-definition television, featuring picture clarity like 35mm
photographs and sound like that of compact disks, is perceived as
the future of the television industry.
   Zenith is competing with larger and better-financed foreign
manufacturers to develop an HDTV system that it hopes will be
chosen as the U.S. standard.
   Zenith, based in this Chicago suburb, said in a statement that
the grant will support its development of manufacturing technology
for the company's patented ``flat tension mask'' picture tubes for
computer monitors and eventually for HDTV sets.
   Zenith said foreign companies are building or recently completed
six large-screen color picture tube plants in the United States.
The company said it plans to ``leapfrog over the foreign
competition with new production processes.''
   In August, the Defense Department said it would give Zenith more
than $1 million in research funds for flat tension mask technology
with military applications.
   Zenith's bid to succeed through HDTV is regarded by many
analysts as a long shot. The company lost money four of the last
five years and rolled up a net loss of $26.8 million from
continuing operations through the first nine month of 1990.
   Zenith also faces a possible takeover bid by New Jersey
manufacturer Nycor Inc. Nycor recently disclosed it owns 8.2
percent of Zenith's common stock and said it is considering
acquiring the company.

<TEXT>
   The European Community late today
approved a plan for modest cuts in government farm payments,
breaking a nearly monthlong deadlock that had threatened the
collapse of world trade talks.
   Agriculture and trade ministers of the 12-nation trading bloc
endorsed a carefully worded proposal that sought to ease fears of
many governments that their farmers would be severely hurt by the
reductions.
   ``What we have offered is a very considerable (proposal),'' said
British Agriculture Secretary John Gummer after two days of
bargaining.
   The proposal will now be presented to negotiators in the Uruguay
Round talks, an ambitious four-year effort to overhaul the world
trading system.
   The agreement came after a second day of bargaining among the
ministers, agonizing over a way to remove one of the most emotional
obstacles to easing world trade tensions, the generous subsidies
paid to European farmers. Six previous attempts to find a solution
ended in failure.
   At issue was a proposal to pare subsidies on farm crops by 30
percent over 10 years, starting in 1986. Some reductions have
already been made.
   The trading bloc was under international pressure to resolve the
dispute, which has threatened the outcome of the Uruguay Round of
negotiations, an ambitious four-year effort to overhaul the world
trade system.
   Agriculture is one of 15 areas under discussion in the trade
negotiations, which began in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of Punta
del Este.
   But the United States, Australia, Argentina and others insist it
holds the key to liberalizing trade in other areas, including
textiles, manufactured goods and services, such as
telecommunications and banking. Argentina has even threatened to
walk out of the round if deep cuts are not made in farm subsidies.
   On Monday, the 14 nations of the Cairns group, led by Australia,
said if no real progress were made in the agriculture talks by
mid-November, they would have to ``reassess'' their position on the
final round of bargaining, set to get under way in early December
in Brussels.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said she hoped the
European Community ``will heed the Cairns group's call to negotiate
fundamental agricultural reform.''
   ``The success of the Uruguay Round now hangs in the balance,''
she said Monday in Geneva.
   The new EC proposal will be be submitted to the trade talks as
the community's opening position in the final round of bargaining.
   The community is the only participant that has not yet put its
offer on the table. The deadline was Oct. 15.
   The Bush administration wants its trading partners to slash farm
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent
over a 10-year period, starting in 1991.
   The Uruguay Round is held under the auspices of the 100-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and an accord for
freer world trade.

   Wal-Mart operates 141 Sam's Wholesale outlets and 1,503 Wal-Mart
discount stores in 34 states.
   A statement by the companies said Wal-Mart would acquire The
Wholesale Club for the equivalent of $21 a share. With about 8
million shares outstanding, the deal is worth $170 million, said a
spokesman for The Wholesale Club.
   The Wholesale Club shareholders will have the option of
receiving either Wal-Mart common stock or cash for their common
stock, subject to the limitation that not more than 20 percent of
the aggregate may be paid in cash.
   The deal is subject to approval by The Wholesale Club's

   The stock market fell today, as traders pondered
the uncertainties raised by the elections, the Persian Gulf crisis
and an enormous sale of new U.S. Treasury debt.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 13.86 at
2,488.37 as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 678 up, 749 down and
511 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 117.13 million shares with one
hour left to trade.
   Analysts saw no real pattern in today's trading.
   ``It's uncertainty more than anything else,'' said Sara Cerato,
a vice president at Nomura Securities International Inc. ``I'm
hearing more rumors about war breaking out after the election.''
   Some investment strategists are even starting to pick days that
they believe will be the beginning of the war, she said.
   Jack Solomon at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said traders were also
nervously watching oil prices and waiting for the results of the
quarterly government bond auction, which began today and will be
completed Thursday.
   The Treasury is selling a record $34.25 billion in 3-year,
10-year and 30-year debt securities.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell to their lowest
levels in eight months Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
signs of slack demand and large yields prompted selling and
profit-taking.
   Wheat futures ended slightly higher. Corn was slightly lower.
   A survey of grain analysts revealed that most experts expect the
Agriculture Department to raise its 1990 U.S. soybean crop estimate
Thursday from last month's projection of 1.82 billion bushels.
   The private estimates averaged 1.84 billion bushels but at least
one respected firm, Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc., expects
a harvest of 1.9 billion bushels.
   Don Roose, an analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc. in Des Moines,
Iowa, said further selling was prompted by sluggish export sales of
U.S. soybeans and by technical, chart-based factors.
   ``I do think the overall psychology in the market is bearish,''
Roose said. ``We've got an overabundant amount of bearishness
coming at us right now.''
   At the close, soybean futures were 7 cents lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in November at $5.76 a
bushel, the lowest close for a near-month contract since March 14;
wheat was 1{ cents to 1} cents higher with December at $2.65} a

<HEAD>Continental Decides Against Selling Honolulu-Tokyo Leg of Route</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially-ailing Continental Airlines yanked
the Honolulu-Tokyo leg of its Houston-Tokyo route from a list of
assets it may sell, saying Tuesday that the hard-won route is too
important to put on the block.
   The decision came just days after Continental President Hollis
Harris told local business leaders the airline may have to sell
some international routes and possibly implement layoffs to cope
with skyrocketing fuel prices.
   Harris said then that one plan under consideration was selling
Continental's Air Micronesia, the carrier's Pacific service
operation. Air Micronesia holds the authority to fly from Honolulu
to Tokyo.
   But Continental said Monday it had decided not to slll that leg,
which began service four months ago.
   ``We decided against it because it is of great importance here
in our hometown,'' Continental spokesman Art Kent said Tuesday.
   Kent noted that local business and civic leaders worked with
airline officials for 24 years to ``get direct air service between
Houston and Tokyo. There are a large number of businesses here, and
the potential for industrial growth is very important.''
   The route also ferries Japanese vacationers to one of Hawaii's
prime holiday spots.
   ``(Harris) said last week that the Honolulu-Tokyo (route) might
have to be included (in asset sales), but after further
consideration, we decided that this direct service is just too
important to our community and to Continental, so we decided to
take it off the block,'' Kent said.
   Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, noted
that the route helps foster business with Japan. About 125 Japanese
companies do business in the city.
   Although Continental can fly under its own authority from
Houston to Honolulu, Air Micronesia holds the governmental
authority to fly from Honolulu to Tokyo, the most lucrative leg of
the trip.
   Continental officials have negotiated with Air Micronesia and
received approval to separate the Honolulu-Tokyo route from any
future sale of the partnership.
   The carrier also said it has been reviewing several options for
dealing with monthly fuel bills, which have risen substantially
since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. Continental said its October bill
was $70 million more than it paid in July.
   Last month, Continental's board of directors considered filing
for bankruptcy protection because of the rising fuel bills - the
result of the continuing Persian Gulf crisis. But it opted to sell
off assets and undertake other measures to remain afloat.

<HEAD>Kellogg Holds Prices on Best Sellers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., which has seen
private-label brands take a bite out of sales of its most popular
cereals, is making its latest price increase a bit easier for
consumers to swallow.
   The world's largest cereal maker said Tuesday it has raised
prices on most of its products an average of 3.7 percent, but is
exempting Corn Flakes - for the second straight year - and Frosted
Flakes, two of its biggest sellers.
   Because those cereals and some smaller brands were omitted from
the increase, the net price increase is about 2.8 percent, Kellogg
spokesman Richard Lovell said Tuesday. The increase took effect
Saturday.
   William E. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive
officer, told industry analysts last week that since 1987,
private-label versions had increased their market share to 6.2
percent from 3.6 percent, largely at the expense of Corn Flakes,
Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Raisin Bran and Froot Loops.
   LaMothe told the analysts that ``in response to very competitive
conditions, including competition from unbranded products, we'd be
very conservative in our increases,'' Lovell said.
   Over the last couple of years, Kellogg has seen its market share
dip from about 41 percent to 38 percent of the approximately $7
billion ready-to-eat domestic cereal industry. The industry has
been relatively flat this year after a few years of hefty sales
growth, analysts said.
   Kellogg's increase is well below the average 5.9 percent
increase rival General Mills Inc. announced Oct. 19. However,
analysts noted, Kellogg raised its prices an average of 2.2 percent
last spring, while General Mills' last increase was in November
1989.
   Ralston-Purina Co., which makes about half of all cereal sold to
private companies for sale under their own labels, also is gaining
ground with such novelty children's products as Teen-age Mutant
Ninja Turtles and Batman cereals, said John C. Maxwell Jr., cereal
analyst for Wheat First Securities of Richmond, Va.
   But, Maxwell said, Minneapolis-based General Mills is in the
best position for the 1990s with the popularity of oat-based
cereals such as Cheerios still on the rise.
   ``If it doesn't say bran or oats on the label, people aren't
buying,'' Maxwell said. ``Unless Kellogg develops new products to
offset the decline (in older brands), they're going to be in
trouble.''
   However, LaMothe told analysts last week that new products,
because of their increased cost and riskiness, probably would not
be a key to regaining market share.
   Analyst Edward Eyring of Argus Research Corp. in New York said
his company recently has taken a more bullish view of Kellogg and
thinks the relatively conservative price increase is a ``step in
the right direction.''
   ``We think Kellogg has untapped potential,'' he said. ``We have
confidence that the company will be able to successfully tap the
international market for cereals as it intends to do and weather
the competitive pressures that private brands are putting on it.''

<HEAD>European Ministers Finally Endorse Crop Subsidy Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community late Tuesday
approved modest cuts in government farm payments, breaking a nearly
month-long deadlock that had threatened to end world trade talks.
   The agreement was reached on the community's seventh attempt to
endorse the proposal. The plan would pare subsidies on major farm
crops by 30 percent over 10 years, starting in 1986. Some
reductions have already been made.
   It's unlikely, though, that the offer will be received warmly by
the United States and other nations. The Bush administration wants
its trading partners to slash farm income supports by 75 percent
and export subsidies by 90 percent over 10 years, starting in 1991.
   But Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero cautioned, ``It would
be a grave error on the part of our trading partners to judge that
this position is not (one) of great openness and ambition.''
   The plan will now be presented to negotiators in the Uruguay
Round talks, an ambitious four-year effort by 100 nations to
overhaul the world trading system.
   The community is the last major player to put its offer on the
bargaining table. It missed an Oct. 15 deadline for submitting
positions for the final round of negotiations, which begin next
month.
   The proposal endorsed Tuesday by ministers from the 12-nation
trading bloc seeks to ease fears that the nations' farmers would be
hurt severely by the subsidy cuts.
   The plan includes assurances to not only compensate farmers for
income losses, but also to assure that cheaper, imported goods will
not push home-grown products off the market.
   It also pledges to limit the impact on poor regions in the
European Community and to soften proposed cuts in supports for
olive oil and other products grown in Mediterranean countries.
   ``After long negotiations, we got very good improvements,'' said
German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle, whose country along with
France had been balking at bigger cuts. ``We can say to our farmers
that they will have compensation for the 30 percent reductions.''
   French Agriculture Minister Louis Mermaz described the outcome
as ``excellent.''
   ``We have to look the Americans straight in the face. We are not
going to buy from them what we make ourselves,'' he added.
   British Agriculture Secretary John Gummer, whose government had
been opposing French and German efforts to weaken the plan, said
there was little change in the original proposal.
   But he said the community's drawn-out discussions indicated that
further cuts would be very hard to negotiate.
   ``It is clear from the negotiations that the European Community
... (does) find reductions in support extremely difficult,'' he
told reporters.
   The trading bloc was under international pressure to resolve the
dispute. Agriculture is one of 15 areas under discussion in the
trade negotiations, and the United States, Australia and Argentina
insist it holds the key to liberalizing trade in other areas, from
textiles and services to telecommunications and banking.
   Argentina has even threatened to walk out of the round if deep
cuts are not made in farm subsidies.
   On Monday, the 14 nations of the Cairns group, led by Australia,
said if no real progress were made in the agriculture talks by
mid-November, they would have to ``re-assess'' their position on
the final bargaining round.
   In delaying the agreement, the French and German governments
voiced different concerns.
   Germany, whose government is worried about the farming coalition
in Dec. 2 elections, insisted on compensatory measures to make up
for any income losses to farmers.
   France, the EC's chief farm exporter, argued the plan could
lower trade barriers so much that cheaper, imported goods could
flood the trading bloc.
   The Uruguay Round is held under the auspices of the 100-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and an accord for
freer world trade.

   American workers' productivity climbed at the
fastest pace in two years during the July-September quarter but
hours worked fell, the government said Tuesday in a sign that the
economic slowdown is forcing businesses to make do with fewer
employees.
   ``The good news is that productivity is up; the bad news is
we're in a recession,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, a
Washington-based consultant.
   In the third quarter, non-farm productivity - output per hour of
work - advanced at a 1.6 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate
compared with the previous three-month period. It was the third
straight quarter in which productivity improved from the previous
three-month period, and the best pace since the July-September
quarter of 1988.
   Productivity rose 0.3 percent in the second quarter, fell 1.3
percent in the first quarter and dropped 2.5 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year.
   However, the number of hours worked edged down 0.1 percent in
the third quarter, the first decline in more than four years.
Economists say this shows that employers are coping with economic
sluggishness with layoffs, hiring freezes and limits on overtime.
   ``What's happened here is that in 1989 the economy was very
weak, but business optimism was still strong and businesses didn't
lay off people,'' Evans said. ``Productivity has picked up because
they are laying off people who should have been laid off last
year.''
   Despite the improvement, productivity is still well below the
level needed to significantly boost Americans' living standard,
according to most economists.
   ``It's better, but subpar,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the
Boston Co.
   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more
during each hour of work, is vital to increasing the nation's
standard of living without inflation.
   Non-farm productivity is increasing at an average annual pace of
0.2 percent so far this year, compared with a 0.7 percent decline
for all of last year.
   Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.6 percent a year
- better than the 1.2 percent average in the 1970s but far worse
than the 2.5 percent annual gain posted from 1947 to 1967.
   Sinai said manufacturing, where productivity leapt at a 5.6
percent annual rate in the third quarter compared with 2.6 percent
for all of last year, is making impressive gains. However,
productivity growth in the service sector, which accounts for a
much larger share of the economy, remains dismal, he said.
   A fundamental improvement in education, increased investment in
new technology and better roads and other public infrastructure are
needed in the long term to improve services productivity, Sinai
said.
   ``In the meantime, the squeeze of a recession will force
services to do more with less. ... But that's a ... painful way to
get productivity growth up,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, hourly labor costs, a major indication of inflation
for businesses, shot up 4.5 percent in the third quarter. That was
an improvement over the 5 percent rate in the second quarter but
still worse than the 3.2 percent increase for all of 1989.
   Unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price inflation, rose
2.8 percent in the third quarter compared with 4.7 percent in the
second quarter. Unit labor costs averaged 3.9 percent in the 1989.
   Total business productivity, including farming, rose 1.9 percent
in the third quarter.

<HEAD>Ratings Agency Lowers Rating on $1.7 Billion in Harcourt Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings
Tuesday on about $1.7 billion in debt issued by Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc., the publishing and insurance giant.
   The ratings agency said business setbacks last year in the
company's flagship elementary reading program ``hobbles growth for
the firm,'' and a heavy debt service commitment due in 1993
increases chances that the company will have to undergo a debt
restructuring or sell assets before then.
   The agency said it was lowering its ratings on $200 million in
senior unsecured notes to CCC from B-minus and on $1.5 billion in
subordinated debt to CCC-minus from CCC-plus.
   Under the agency's ratings system, debt with a CCC rating is
seen as predominantly speculative with respect to its ability to
pay interest and repay principal according to the terms.
   A debt rating is one of the features that determines the price
of a bond in the marketplace.
   Harcourt, based on Orlando, Fla., took on a heavy debt load in
May 1987 when it underwent a restructuring and paid a special
dividend that effectively warded off a hostile takeover bid from
British media baron Robert Maxwell.
   Harcourt said in a statement it was disappointed by the agency's
ratings action, but pointed out that the agency noted that
Harcourt's operating profit had resumed growth.
   Harcourt said it was ``making adequate capital investments to
produce a competitive elementary reading program in 1992'' and
noted that it recently hired the investment firm Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. to explore alternatives for dealing with
Harcourt's heavy debt.
   For the first six months of the fiscal year through June 30,
Harcourt lost $94.9 million, or $1.47 a share, on revenue of $625.4
million. It lost $158.7 million, or $2.77 a share, on revenue of
$570 million a year earlier.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Surge on Renewed War Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heightened fears of war in the Middle East spurred a rally in
the precious metal markets Tuesday.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures rose; pork futures
soared, helping to lift the cattle markets; soybeans hit an
eight-month low; and grain futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $7 to $7.40 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at $388.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.2 cents higher with December at
$4.257 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures finished $6.10 to $10.20 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with November at $426.80 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said speculation is mounting that the U.S.-led
multinational military force in Saudi Arabia will soon attack Iraqi
troops in occupied Kuwait.
   Randolph Donney, chief commodities analyst with the Pegasus
Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said some observers expect an
offensive to be launched as soon as this weekend.
   He said the rally was fueled by signs the Soviet Union may be
willing to send troops to the region to bolster the U.N. force and
by perceptions that Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
``laying down the ground rules'' for an attack during his visit to
U.S. allies in the Middle East.
   Other analysts cited the views of some military strategists that
a military strike would best be launched in November, before the
desert winter sets in.
   ``There are lot of things coming into play and I think you're
getting a little bit of a war scare there,'' Donney said. Gold is
often viewed as a safe investment haven in times of international
crisis.
   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.,
linked further buying to signs of firming demand for gold at the
recent low prices and to position-evening ahead of Friday's
expiration of December gold options on the Commodity Exchange.
   Oil futures ended mostly higher on the New York Merc, where
war-related buying interest was tempered by ideas that oil supplies
might not tighten as much as previously thought in the event of
Middle East war.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute reported that
U.S. supplies of crude oil rose by 5 million barrels last week,
surprising market analysts who had expected a decline of up to 2
million barrels.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 43 cents lower to 67 cents higher
with December at $32.63 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to 1.92
cents higher with December at 86.38 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .99 cent higher with December at 87.75
cents a gallon.
   Pork futures rallied strongly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, helping to lift the cattle markets.
   Near-term hog futures rose the permitted daily limit of 1.5
cents a pound and all pork belly contracts soared the 2
cents-a-pound limit on signs of slow slaughter rates and ideas the
markets have reached a seasonal bottom.
   Reports of wintry weather in the Midwest also fueled buying of
pork contracts. Snow and cold could further slow the movement of
hogs to market.
   Live hog futures settled .25 cent to 1.5 cents higher with
December at 53.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents
higher across the board with February at 68.25 cents a pound; live
cattle were .18 cent to .37 cent higher with December at 77.57
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .83 cent higher with
November at 87.90 cents a pund.
   Soybean futures prices fell to their lowest levels in eight
months on the Chicago Board of Trade as signs of slack demand and
large yields prompted selling and profit-taking. Wheat futures
ended slightly higher. Corn was slightly lower.
   A survey of grain analysts revealed that most experts expect the
Agriculture Department to raise its 1990 U.S. soybean crop estimate
Thursday from last month's projection of 1.82 billion bushels.
   The private estimates averaged 1.84 billion bushels but at least

   Soybeans settled 6} cents lower to } cent higher with November

<HEAD>Dollar Up on Middle East Concerns, Technical Buying; Gold Rises
Sharply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Tuesday on concerns about the
Middle East crisis and on technical buying by traders adjusting
their positions in advance of the results of the day's elections.
   Gold prices moved sharply higher largely on technical factors.
   Currency traders bought dollars aggressively on news that the
U.S. might send more troops to the Middle East and on speculation
about unrest in the Soviet Union.
   The Marine Corps said it was calling up more than 600 reservists
from eight states for combat roles in the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile,
clashes continued among several ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of political uncertainty
overseas, because it is generally seen as a relatively safe
investment. Furthermore, crude oil is bought and sold in dollars,
so if an outbreak of war in the Middle East sends oil prices
skyrocketing, there will be more demand for the U.S. currency.
   In addition, analysts said traders were buying dollars to hedge
their positions pending the outcome of Tuesday's election, with its
potential to redistribute political power by carving up key
election districts.
   ``Just that uncertainty makes people cover up their short
positions,'' said Karen Gibbs, a currency analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   In earlier overseas trading, the dollar was little changed
because of market fears of a U.S. recession and anticipation of
subsequent cuts in U.S. interest rates.
   A reduction in interest rates dampens demand for U.S.
investments, and therefore sends the dollar downward.
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at
128.15 yen, up from late Monday's 126.55. In overnight trading in
Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.20 yen from 127.35 yen Monday, and in
London, it was quoted at 127.25 yen.
   The British pound fell to $1.9657 in New York from $1.9740
Monday, and in earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.9635
from late Monday's $1.9675.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
rates, included: 1.4927 German marks, up from 1.4850; 1.2545 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2505; 5.0055 French francs, up from 4.9810;
1,121.00 Italian lire, up from 1,116.00; and 1.16295 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.15875.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.4875 German marks, down from 1.4880; 1.2505
Swiss francs, unchanged; 4.9885 French francs, down from 4.9875;
1.6768 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6765; 1,116.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,116.25; and 1.1609 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1586.
   Gold rose sharply in domestic trading, climbing $7.10 a troy
ounce to $386.60 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic
National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $385.60, up $6.95.
   Analysts said gold rose on unconfirmed rumors of a large Middle
Eastern buy order.
   In earlier trading in London, gold rose to a late bid price of
$380.25 a troy ounce, up from $377.25 late Monday. In Zurich, the
metal rose to a closing bid of $379.50, up from $376.30 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.20 to close at a bid
$381.13.
   Silver rose on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.234 a troy
ounce, up 3.1 cents. In London, silver was unchanged at a late bid
price of $4.18.

   Oil prices meandered in slow trading Tuesday and
finished mixed, depressed on the one hand by evidence of ample
supply and declining demand, boosted on the other hand by
speculation about Persian Gulf war.
   ``The market is divided equally between fundamentals and Middle
East concern,'' said Bob Baker, a trading strategist at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the key market for
petroleum futures contracts, the December delivery price of
benchmark light sweet crude rose 67 cents a barrel to $32.63. But
the price for oil to be delivered through later winter months
closed lower.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home
heating oil for December delivery rose 1.92 cents a gallon to 86.38
cents. Later-delivery month contracts also rose.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery rose .21 cent
a gallon to 87.75 cents, while later-delivery months were .99 cent
higher to .50 cent lower. Natural gas for December delivery fell
.02 cent per 1,000 cubic feet to $2.383, while later-delivery
months all rose slightly.
   The oil market has been transfixed on developments in the
Persian Gulf since Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forces seized
Kuwait three months ago, inciting world condemnation, a trade
embargo and a U.S.-led military expedition into neighboring Saudi
Arabia.
   Crude prices went from about $20 a barrel to more than $40 but
have since retreated into the $30 range, largely because no shots
have been fired and other oil producers have filled the vacuum
caused by the absence of Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude.
   Moreover, demand for petroleum has fallen since the crisis
began, putting further pressure on prices to fall. Many oil-trading
strategists agree that the only thing propping prices at current
levels is what they call a war premium.
   ``In the past, there was fear that if we did drift into war,
prices would take off,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with
Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. ``At this stage,
people are saying on one hand, we have plenty of oil, but on
another hand we're going to have to deal with Saddam Hussein sooner
or later.''
   Some traders said business was slow Tuesday because of the
impending release of weekly figures of U.S. energy supplies and
production from the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington
trade group.
   The statistics, released after trading finished for the day,
showed stocks of crude oil and gasoline rose in the week ended Nov.
2 vs. a week earlier, while the supply of home heating oil remained
steady. The figures also showed crude imports increased to 5.9
million barrels a day from 5.1 million barrels a day the previous
week.
   The figures substantiated the view that the nation's energy
supplies remain plentiful and that foreign exporters have
alleviated any shortfall caused by the gulf standoff.
   In another sign of easing pressure on prices, the American
Automobile Association reported Tuesday that the average price of
self-serve regular unleaded gasoline fell .3 cent per gallon last
week to $1.377. It was the first weekly drop since a .2 cent
decline Sept. 18.
   AAA's survey, based on a nationwide spot check of stations,
still shows the average price of gasoline has increased 30.2 cents
since Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait.

<HEAD>Price-Fixing Suit Against Airlines Consolidated in Atlanta
^Eds: ADDS reax from airlines after 9th graf pvs, `Delta denies.
Picks up 10th graf pvs, The suit.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta federal judge will hear a consolidated
lawsuit alleging collusion and price-fixing by some of the nation's
major airlines and their computerized fare network.
   The suit was formed when 31 claims filed nationwide were
consolidated Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia. It alleges the airlines use computers to
signal fare changes to each other, agree on price increases and
threaten fare cuts.
   As a result of the alleged collusion, the suit charges that
passengers are forced to pay artificially high ticket prices.
   The defendants are USAir, Northwest, Delta, Continental, United,
TWA and American airlines and the Washington-based computer
clearinghouse, Airline Tariff Publishing Co.
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Marvin H. Shoob
after a panel of federal judges decided Atlanta was most accessible
to all parties in the suit.
   If Shoob certifies the suit as a class action, a decision that's
expected early next year, the plaintiffs could number in the
millions. Customers who purchased a plane ticket since 1987 could
potentially be a party to the suit.
   ``In 1988, 150 million tickets were sold, so that would give you
a rough idea of the possible magnitude of this case,'' said W.
Pitts Carr, the Atlanta attorney who filed the first suit here last
July. ``There are literally tens of millions of people or companies
who are potential class members.''
   The defendants deny the charges.
   ``Delta denies totally the allegations ... concerning our
participation in any conspiracy to fix prices,'' said Edward B.
Krugman, one of the airline's attorneys.
   Spokespeople for United, USAir and Northwest declined comment.
Continental also declined comment, but spokesman Art Kent added,
``We have gone on record before as saying there is no price
collusion and we set our prices according to the market.''
   The suit seeks undetermined damages that could be tripled under
federal antitrust laws. It also asks that the airlines be
restrained from further violation of antitrust laws and that the
computer network be ``restructured so as to discourage future
collusion among airlines.''

<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics
Company Inc. has formed an international consortium to build a new
ethylene glycol plant in Canada, the company said Tuesday.
   The company will be built in Prentiss, Alberta, and be called
Alberta &amp; Orient Glycol Co. Ltd. Union Carbide will own 50 percent,
while the remaining 50 percent will be shared equally by the other
three participants, Far Eastern Textile Ltd., Taiwan; Mitsui &amp; Co.
Ltd., Japan; and Oriental Union Chemical Corp., Taiwan.
   The plant, to be built on the same site as Union Carbide's
existing ethylene glycol plant, is scheduled for startup during the
second half of 1994.
   The company said the new plant will boost total ethylene glycol
capacity at the site to 600,000 tons annualy. Ethylene for the
plant will be supplied by Dow Chemical Canada Inc. from a new unit
to be located at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.
   A.W. Lutz, president of Union Carbide's Industrial Chemicals
Division, said output from the new facility will go primarily to
Far Eastern polyester markets.
   Union Carbide is a world leader in production of ethylene oxide
and ethylene glycol, which is used in antifreeze, polyester fibers,
film and bottle resins and other products.

   The stock market fell Tuesday, as traders
pondered the uncertainties raised by the elections, the Persian
Gulf crisis and an enormous sale of new U.S. Treasury debt.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.08 to
2,485.15.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 709 up, 760 down and 510 unchanged.
   Analysts detected no real pattern in Tuesday's trading.
   ``It's uncertainty more than anything else,'' said Sara Cerato,
a vice president at Nomura Securities International Inc. ``I'm
hearing more rumors about war breaking out after the election.''
   Some investment strategists are even starting to pick days that
they believe will be the beginning of the war, she said.
   Jack Solomon at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said traders were also
nervously watching oil prices and waiting for the results of the
quarterly government bond auction, which began Tuesday and was to
be completed Thursday.
   The Treasury is selling a record $34.25 billion in 3-year,
10-year and 30-year debt securities.
   Crude oil futures, which often move in the opposite direction
from stocks, went up 67 cents to $32.63 per barrel Tuesday for
December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The most active stock in Tuesday's session, Browning Ferris, was
down 6 to 24\ on a disappointing earnings report that came as a
surprise to many analysts.
   Waste Management was off 2 at 33 after announcing it would pay a
court settlement of $19.5 million to avoid fighting civil
price-fixing claims. Analysts were not sure whether news of the
settlement had helped move the stock.
   Circuit City dropped 2~ to 11&rsqb; following the release of sales
reports that were not as strong as analysts were hoping. Unisys
fell &lsqb; to 2} amid concern that it may have to sell assets at
distressed prices.
   Big Board volume totaled 141.13 million shares, down from 147.51
million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional
exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 175.63
million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $18.86 billion, or 0.64
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks fell 1.28
to 170.21.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.47 to 364.97, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.97 at 311.62.

<HEAD>Continental Parent Loses $88.3 Million in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY BENJAMINSON</BYLINE>

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. lost $88.3
million in the third quarter as higher fuel prices increased costs,
the company said Tuesday.
   The loss amounted to $2.31 a share. In the same period last
year, Continental lost $158 million, or $4.09 a share. The company
had revenues of $1.5 billion in the quarter, compared to $1.7
billion in the same quarter last year.
   ``Our results mirror the industry-wide problems posed by
unrestrained increases in the price of fuel,'' Continental chairman
Hollis Harris said in a news release.
   Fuel costs, the company's largest expense, are $70 million
higher per month now than before the Middle East crisis, Harris
said.
   ``Considering fuel problems, we're in the pack,'' spokesman Art
Kent said. The company's losses ``puts us pretty much in line with
what everyone else is suffering with,'' he said.
   For the first nine months of 1990, the company lost $97 million,
or $2.83 a share, on revenue of $4.9 billion. That compares to a
loss of $522.8 million, or $13.51 a share, on revenue of $5 billion
in the first nine months of 1989.
   Continental released the earnings statement after the markets
closed. The company's stock closed up 12{ cents at $2.75 a share on
the American Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   The airline holding company, which was known as Texas Air Corp.
until this summer, is the parent of Continental Airlines. Texas Air
was the parent of Continental and Eastern Airlines, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in 1989 and has been run by a
government-appointed trustee since April 10.
   Included in the holding company's nine months 1990 results is
Eastern's $149.1 million loss on revenues of $673.1 million before
April 10.
   The company's nine months results last year included Eastern's
loss of $569.7 million on revenues of $1 billion.
   Continental Airlines lost $55.1 million on revenues of $1.4
billion during the third quarter this year. In last year's third
quarter, the airline earned $43.5 million on revenues of $1.3
billion.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Continental earned $62.9
million on revenues of $4 billion. That compares to net income of
$59.1 million on revenues of $3.9 billion for the same nine months
in 1989.
   Continental has said it took the Honolulu-Tokyo leg of its
Houston-Tokyo route from a list of assets for sale, saying the
hard-won route was too important to the city.
   Last week, Harris told local business leaders the airline may
have to sell some international routes and possibly furlough
employees to cope with higher fuel costs.

<HEAD>Additional NLRB Charges to be Filed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The staff of the National Labor Relations
Board is bringing additional charges of unfair labor practice
against Greyhound Lines, the board announced Tuesday.
   The charges result from complaints by the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, whose 6,000 drivers went on strike in March
over wages and job security issues. The company contends they no
longer have jobs because the bus line has hired replacements.
   Jerry M. Hunter, general counsel of the board, said he has
authorized the NLRB's Milwaukee office to file additional charges
in 16 cases around the country. The new charges will allege that
Greyhound unlawfully fired strikers because of union activities,
coerced employees through the throwing of rocks at strikers by
company guards, threatened strikers and refused to provide the
union with information, he said.
   The new charges will be consolidated with the original complaint
filed by the Milwaukee office at Hunter's recommendation. That
complaint, filed in May, accused Greyhound of putting its final
bargaining proposal into effect before a breakdown in talks, and
said the strike was the result of an unfair labor practice.
   If the general counsel prevails before the five-member board,
the original complaint could result in an order to reinstate the
strikers with back pay.
   Still other accusations against the company by the union remain
to be investigated, and will require postponing a hearing before an
administrative law judge on the original complaint from Nov. 29 to
Jan. 15.
   In Dallas, LIz Dunn, a spokeswoman for the company, said
Greyhound had not seen the original complaint, but, ``Greyhound
fully expects to prevail when we have an opportunity to present the
case.''
   She said the new charges would not affect the filing of a
reorganization plan with a bankruptcy court later this month. The
company has been operating under court protection from creditors.
