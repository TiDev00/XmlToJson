   Voting yes were 216 Democrats and 164 Republicans.
   Voting no were 29 Democrats and no Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.

   Tropical chocolate, a
synthetic that tastes like the real thing but won't melt in the
heat, could be ready for shipment to the Persian Gulf in time for
the holidays.
   The all-electric tank won't be.
   Military historians are fond of saying that generals are forever
fighting the last war. The Army Materiel Command has the job of
making sure that doesn't happen.
   The AMC, which is responsible for research and development of
gear used by the Army, is playing host this week to an exposition
of what the future may hold for the nation's warriors.
   ``The soldier in the field is our customer,'' said Edward Brown,
civilian deputy director of the AMC Office of Technology Management
and Planning.
   The projects presented at this base 30 miles north of Baltimore
are in various stages of development - from a wild idea to a
concept on the verge of production.
   The all-electric tank, which would use batteries or
superconducting technology, is one of those projects way off in the
future.
   Taken as a whole, the projects represent the beginning of a
shift from a near-total preoccupation with the Soviet threat to a
realization the nation could face a myriad of military challenges
in coming years.
   ``The buzzword we use these days is that instead of weapons of
mass destruction, we're looking to produce weapons of mass
disruption,'' said Brown.
   The object, said Brown, is to create a smaller, leaner but more
effective force that can fight a small-scale war in a jungle as
well as it could a major tank battle in central Europe.
   To that end, the Army and its scientists are pushing against the
frontiers of science.
   In laboratories across the country, researchers are looking for
military applications for the next generation of supercomputers and
trying to harness recent breakthroughs in magnetics and
superconductors.
   They are working with corporations and universities on new
fabrics to improve uniforms, new materials to enhance tanks and
personnel carriers and robots to reduce the danger to soldiers.
   The scientists and managers gathered here envision an army in
which the soldier has ``enhanced survivability and enhanced
lethality.''
   In the next century, the GI on patrol may carry his own computer
along with tastier rations. He may be wearing a self-contained
air-conditioned uniform to protect him from the heat as well as
chemical weapons.
   Generals will be able to rely on computers that produce
corps-level battle plans in 40 minutes, a task that now takes at
least a day.
   And those computers will be able to give commanders a range of
options and tell them when a battle plan isn't working and suggest
appropriate responses.
   Officers will brief their troops using TV screens, instead of
pointers and paper maps on easels.
   The technology expo is designed to spark new ideas as well as
sell the nation on the importance of such work in an era of budget
cuts.
   ``The decision was very specifically made to keep the R&amp;D as
high as possible because that's the seed corn,'' Brown said.
``That's the future. We're going to push the technology.''

<TEXT>
   The Air Force has added a ninth
navigation satellite to an orbiting network capable of pinpointing
U.S. military units anywhere in the world to within 50 feet.
   A Delta rocket blasted off with the $65 million Navstar
satellite at 5:56 p.m. Monday.About 25 minutes later, the satellite
separated from the booster as planned and settled in an orbit
12,532 miles above Earth.
   ``Everything appears to have gone well,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jim Jannette. Two launch attempts late last week were delayed
by bad weather.
   The 3,675-pound satellite is part of a series of advanced Global
Positioning System spacecraft designed to guide warplanes, ships
and other military craft with extreme accuracy. The first Navstar
was launched in February 1989.
   Fifteen more Navstar satellites are scheduled to be launched by
early 1993 under the $8.5 billion program. Three will serve as
spares.
   The satellites, which have a working lifetime of 7{ years, keep
track of the speed of vehicles on land, sea or air to within a
fraction of a mile per hour. Inside each is an atomic clock with an
error rate of one second every 300,000 years.
   The spacecraft can pinpoint locations within 50 feet in any
weather anywhere in the world - in some locations, within 10 feet.
   Military personnel use receivers as small as telephones to tune
into the network.
   Seven earlier, less sophisticated satellites still are
functioning.

   It was 11:30 a.m. when rude laughter and the
whoosh of rushing water sundered Deborah Terrell's algebra lesson.
   The odds against the lesson already were high enough for Ms.
Terrell and her 19 eighth-graders at Burnet Street Elementary
School, a magnet school where 200 of 500 children are homeless.
   This day, like most Ms. Terrell has spent here for the last
decade, would be a melange of frustration, fatigue, self-doubt and,
perhaps, a small victory or two.
   But as she spoke of equations, a former student in a prankish
mood gleefully sprayed the glass in her classroom door with jets
from the hallway fire extinguishers.
   ``See that?'' she said, pointing angrily to the truant. ``This
is fun? What kind of life is that?''
   Later that day, as if sent to restore her faith, a second
visitor dropped in: Tawana Woolridge, a prim, polite 12th-grader at
Newark's tough Central High whom Ms. Terrell had taught five years
earlier.
   ``She was my favorite teacher,'' Tawana said. ``She wasn't too
strict, but she didn't let you get away with anything, either.''
   ``When one kid like that comes back and is making it, that's
what makes it all worthwhile,'' said the teacher.
   ---
   3 p.m. at last.
   Most of the students leaving Room 303 headed for Baxter Terrace
or other downtown Newark housing projects. Three caught buses for
homeless shelters at the Lincoln or Carlton Hotels.
   Ms. Terrell slumped back in her chair, exhausted.
   She hadn't always wanted to be a teacher. She studied psychology
at Rutgers University but quickly lost her taste for it after an
internship at a mental health center: ``Too depressing.''
   ``When I went to school, everyone wanted to be a teacher. I came
here to Burnet to do my student teaching. The seventh-grade teacher
left one day, and the principal just gave me her class. The rest is
history.''
   At age 36, her chosen career now earns her about $33,000 a year.
   ``I don't see myself here for another 10 years. But I guess I
wonder: if I leave, who's going to be here for these kids?''
   Later, back home in her neat, wood-frame house on a
tough-looking downtown Newark street, she'd make sure her sons
Malcolm, 8, and Toussaint, 9, buckled down to homework, as her own
mother once had for her.
   But now, as the last pupil straggled out, she needed to
decompress.
   ``I have to wind down before I can see my kids,'' she said. ``If
I don't take half an hour to wind down, I might take things out on
them.''
   After dinner, homework awaited - grading neatly bound projects
hr students had prepared on the evils of drugs to mark National
Drug Awareness Month. Then she planned to phone parents to exhort
them to attend open school night.
   She wondered aloud: ``Am I just speaking to the air? Did anyone
learn anything today?''
   She thought.
   ``Well, I know Murad learned something.''
   Murad, a bright, cocky, reed-thin boy, is quick with excuses and
short on study habits. Ms. Terrell had forced him to sit in a desk
alongside hers, a spot known in her class as ``Out of Society.''
   But today Murad actually had taken notes in class and used them
to solve a math problem.
   A small victory.
   And Ronald. A big day for him, too. Quiet, withdrawn, homeless
for the last year, Ronald had stood up for the first time and given
an oral presentation. The class had applauded. Ronald had smiled
shyly.
   Another victory.
   Victories come hard at Burnet Street, designated four years ago
a magnet school for homeless children in kindergarten through
eighth-grade. Only last year did the board of education add staff
and resources to help the school accommodate this most troubled
population. Teachers say they have yet to get any formal training
on how to deal with them.
   ``Kids were sleeping on desks, had to meet bus schedules, had to
make stops at the grocery stores,'' Ms. Terrell said.
   Average daily attendance at Burnet Street is just 87.6 percent;
the national average is more than 92 percent. Twenty percent at
Burnet need special help with basic skills, and 15 percent have
been held back a grade or more. Only 5 percent of parents
participate in school activities, according to New Jersey state
statistics.
   For Ms. Terrell, teaching is a daily gantlet of delays,
interruptions, excuses.
   The PA system squawks messages. The bell rings every 45 minutes.
   In the space of a morning, the attendance teacher knocks on the
door to take roll. Four Hispanic students get pulled out of class
for special English classes. Eight others are summoned for remedial
classes to boost low English and math test scores. Still another
group goes for computer instruction. In the afternoon, Ms.
Terrell's homeless students are called away early to catch buses to
shelters.
   And then there are the excuses.
   A kid tells her she didn't do her homework because ``I left the
book in school, OK?''
   At that, Ms. Terrell's mouth twists upward in a streetwise curl
that says without words: You think I haven't heard that nonsense a
thousand times before? You think you're kidding me? I was raised in
the same streets you were.
   ``No,'' she finally says. ``That's not OK. You know how I feel
about excuses and that's not even a good one. And get rid of the
gum!''
   She has a way of mixing humor, affection and discipline. On her
desk is a small sign: ``U toucha My Desk, I breaka U face!''
Sometimes she'll say with a hint of a smile: ``You know how
un-rational I am.''
   How do the kids feel about her?
   Defiant. Yet dependent. She sometimes invites her students to
write what they think, without signing their papers. They write her
things they wouldn't tell their parents: about drugs, AIDS, their
neighborhoods, being homeless.
   ---
   Her kids say Ms. Terrell sometimes gets teary during her ``life
lectures,'' when she speaks about what she wants for them, why
she's there.
   One such talk comes minutes after the class's standardized state
test scores arrive.
   The 7th grade scores, the ones her kids took the spring before,
show only 28 percent testing above average in math - the lowest
passing rate in the school by far.
   ``Oh brother,'' she says. ``We're the lowest on the list.
   ``Everyone has so much time to talk and play, talk and play.
What bothers me is I know you can do better. These scores are
garbage. That's a reflection on me. Whatever I have to do to get
this up, I will do.
   ``You always should expect to do the best for yourself. There's
too much potential in this room. I'm just here to help you. But you
have to help me help you. You already have the strikes against you.
You're minorities, blacks, Puerto Ricans. So people look at these
scores and say, `What did you expect?'
   ``I know where you belong, and I want to take you. I certainly
don't want any of you in here next year shooting fire extinguishers
at the window.''

   Nearly 40 percent of the nation's minority students and about 30
percent of its poor children are educated in large, urban school
districts, according to data collected by the Council of Great City
Schools.
   About 11 percent, or 4.5 million U.S. schoolchildren, attend
school in the nation's 37 largest urban districts, according to the
council.
   Urban districts with the biggest enrollments are New York,
940,000; Los Angeles, 592,000; Chicago, 394,000; Miami-Dade County,
Fla., 268,000; Philadelphia, 191,000; Houston, 190,000; Detroit,
174,000; Dallas, 131,000; San Diego, 117,000; Baltimore, 107,000,
and Memphis, Tenn., 106,000.
   The families of nearly 1.5 million urban schoolchildren are
below the poverty line; 408,000 are enrolled in classes for the
handicapped; 293,000 have limited English proficiency.
   Forty-five percent are black, 26 percent white, 23 percent
Hispanic, and 5 percent Asian.
   Daily attendance averages 94 percent in urban elementary
schools, 91 percent in middle schools and 87.6 percent in high
schools. The national average for all schools is 92 percent.
   Excluding federal funds and capital spending, Pittsburgh spent
the most per pupil among the 50 largest school districts: $7,163,
according to 1988-89 data from the American Federation of Teachers,
the latest comparable statistics available. Memphis, Tenn., at
$2,521, spent the least. The 50-district average was $4,365.
   Average class size in the the 50 largest U.S. districts is about
17 students, compared with the 17.4 average for the entire nation,
according to AFT statistics.
   Newark, N.J., had the best pupil-teacher ratio, 11.5, followed
by St. Louis, 12.4, Boston, 12.6, Baltimore County, 13.5,
Pittsburgh, 14.0, Orange County (Orlando) Fla., 14.5, Denver, 14.5,
and Columbus, Ohio, 14.5. Los Angeles had the most crowded classes
among the 50 largest districts, with a student-teacher ratio of 24.
   Some 203,000 teachers work in inner-city schools.
   Among urban districts with settled contracts in 1990-91,
Philadelphia teachers earn from $24,000 to $49,600; Newark
teachers, $23,867 to $50,757; Minneapolis teachers, $22,192 to
$47,273; Cincinnati teachers, $21,679 to $44,847; Baltimore
teachers, $22,162 to $43,002; and Dade County, Fla., teachers,
$26,500 to $49,400.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Enrique Torruella swooped the
UH-1H ``Huey'' helicopter below 1,000 feet into the range of
guerrilla rifle fire. He banked the craft steeply in a tightening
gyre, then abruptly landed in the combt zone.
   The copter's deafening rotor flattened the waist-high grass.
Pvt. Manuel Zepeda, squinting through swollen eyes, his face
bloodied by shrapnel from a grenade, ran to the waiting ship. So
did another soldier carrying on his back Pvt. Santos Alfaro, badly
wounded in the head and arm by the same explosion.
   The aircraft was on the ground less than a minute. Torruella
revved the turbo-jet engine and raced off. Before the aircraft
reached safety beyond the range of enemy fire, medic Cpl. Tomas
Vasquez had a needle in Alfaro's arm and plasma dripping into his
veins.
   The Grupo de Helicopteros at Ilopango air base five miles east
of San Salvador embodies the single most significant tactical
advantage government forces have over the FMLN leftist rebel army.
   Military analysts consider the infusion of helicopters and pilot
training provided by Washington from 1982-85 crucial in preventing
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front from winning the
civil war.
   The fleet provides transport of troops and supplies, rocket and
machine-gun support for ground troops and evacuation of nearly all
the wounded government soldiers.
   According to casualty statistics, no job in the military is as
dangerous as that of the squadron's 60 pilots. During the past 18
months it has become more so.
   The guerrillas since early 1989 have worked diligently on
anti-aircraft tactics. Virtually all the approximately 65 aging
Hueys and the few, newer Hughes 500s making up the squad have been
hit by ground fire.
   Several, perhaps a dozen, have been shot out of the sky. The
precise number is classified.
   Thirty pilots have been killed in action since the group was
formed in 1982. Most of the survivors have been wounded. Part of
Torruella's right foot was shot off in August 1989 when rifle fire
pierced the floor.
   Charcoal portraits of 26 of those killed adorn a wall of the
lobby of the group's headquarters. Once the four pending portraits
are added, there will be space for only two more before room will
have to made on another wall.
   The air force jealously guards information on rebel
effectiveness against its planes and helicopters. But, by way of
indication, on both days an AP correspondent and photographer
accompanied crews on ``medivac'' missions, at least one ship was
struck by gunfire.
   Most of the time, damage is limited to perforations of the
fuselage. But if 7.62mm fire from guerrilla AK-47s strikes the
engine, the tail rotor or hydraulic hoses, the helicopter may crash
or be forced to land off base.
   ``Rene,'' a guerrilla squad leader based on the slopes of
Guazapa Mountain 20 miles north of San Salvador, sat in the shade
one recent afternoon and described ``triangulation.'' The tactic
concentrates fire of up to 15 AKs on helicopters descending to
either pick up wounded or deliver supplies.
   The circling and dipping practiced by the pilots are intended to
minimize guerrilla efficiency.
   ``If you approach in a straight line, they get a bead on you,''
said Torruella, a smooth-faced 24-year-old. Like several of the
squad's members, he looks out of uniform more like an adolescent
than a combat chopper-jockey.
   All the pilots except one - a recent graduate of the local
aviation school - were trained at the U.S. Army's Fort Rucker in
Alabama.
   ``They have the same training as U.S. pilots. That instruction
combined with constant combat has made them among the best in the
world. Practice makes perfect,'' said Lt. Col. Arch Kielly, U.S.
Air Force attache in El Salvador.
   Military analysts say the air force, especially the helicopter
squadron, was essential to beating back November's large-scale
guerrilla offensive.
   The FMLN accused the government of indiscriminate rocket fire
and strafing of densely populated urban neighborhoods where
guerrillas had dug in.
   Air force authorities and U.S. advisors dispute the allegation,
saying dozens of requests from ground troops for air support were
denied for fear of inflicting unacceptable civilian casualties.
   Judging from what reporters saw during the offensive and from
inspections of battle-scarred neighborhoods afterward, the truth is
somewhere between the government and guerrilla claims.
   Aerial machine-gun fire perforated roofs in several areas and
rockets were launched into a few residential districts. But intense
use of air power appeared to have begun on the offensive's fourth
day, when most civilians had evacuated the battle zones.
   With the insurgents talking of a new offensive in coming weeks,
the pilots face a new peril. The rebels' reported acquisition of
scores of shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles could prove to be
a strategic watershed in the nearly 11-year-old war.
   Employment of similar weapons in the 1980s by U.S.-backed Afghan
guerrillas was one of the keys to the success of their campaign
against Soviet forces.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people, from alcoholics to
soldiers, are slogging through the nation's potato fields in a race
to salvage the rotting crop and save Muscovites from a hungry
winter.
   Joining the forced laborers in the muddy trenches of what the
press has dubbed ``the potato front'' are volunteers who are
lending a hand so they can carry home a sack or two of the starchy
staple that has vanished from store shelves in the capital.
   Tatyana Shcherbach, who was ordered into harvest duties by her
bosses at the Lepes Metallurgical Factory, laughed heartily as her
three co-workers joked about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We've been wondering whether Gorbachev eats potatoes like
this,'' she said, holding up a half-rotten one, ``or if he gets
potatoes from the States.''
   Her laughter spilled across the collective farm's half-plowed
rows in the village of Peshki about 30 miles northwest of Moscow
along the highway to Leningrad.
   The 44-year-old woman giggled, saying she and her colleagues had
concluded Gorbachev would opt for the Soviet spud because ``he's
not the kind of man to eat anything special.''
   As a stiff wind blew chilled unprotected hands in the 40-degree
temperatures, Shcherbach said: ``It helps to joke and make fun of
one another. It makes the job much easier, and such weather
requires jokes.''
   She and about 100 colleagues from the factory plunked the
potatoes into pails and carried them to large sacks standing in the
rows. Many potatoes in the field already were rotten, Shcherbach
said, holding a shriveled one in her soiled, thin cotton gloves
before discarding it.
   Drenching rains have turned the fields to mud, crippling harvest
operations for most of September and killing much of the crop.
Moscow has only 7 percent of the potato stock it needs for the
winter.
   Students and soldiers were drafted into the harvest weeks ago,
and leaders of Moscow's regional government invited city dwellers
to go to nearby collective and state farms to help dig potatoes -
with an option to buy them at low prices.
   As Shcherbach spoke, young Red Army soldiers busily collected
the 110-pound sacks of potatoes and hefted them into the arms of
compatriots riding atop an open trailer pulled by an old tractor.
   ``We'd rather be doing something else,'' admitted Pvt. Taras
Grebnichenko of Kiev. The Soviet Union has ordered 23,000 soldiers
into harvest duties in the Moscow area.
   ``Welcome to the Gulag Archipelago!'' laughed one of a
half-dozen soldiers warming themselves at a nearby bonfire,
referring to the Alexander Solzhenitsyn book about Soviet labor
camps.
   The soldiers roasted some potatoes on the embers. A blackened
one was picked from the ashes and handed to a comrade who pulled a
folded up newspaper containing salt from beneath his tunic,
seasoned it, and offered it to eat.
   They kidded each other as they passed around the potatoes. ``Do
you know how to speak Arabic?'' one joked, alluding to the Persian
Gulf crisis and possible duty in a drier climate.
   The mood was more sullen about 50 yards away, where 40
recovering alcoholics from Moscow methodically picked up the
potatoes under the close supervision of a brigade leader.
Alcoholics in the Soviet Union's treatment centers frequently do
such forced labor.
   Working in a different part of the field and espousing a
different attitude was Nikolai G. Gorodetsky. ``I'm eager to help,
and get some potatoes as a result, because the shelves are picked
clean,'' he said.
   Individuals like Gorodetsky are entitled to keep every sixth
sack of potatoes they dig, or pay 45 cents for every 2.2 pounds for
their entire bounty.
   The engineer, joined by his wife, Lyudmilla, and teen-age son,
Sergei, said his family would harvest four sacks - about 440 pounds
- and give two of them back to the collective farm, taking home 220
pounds at a cost of about $45.
   That price is no different than in state stores, but long lines
of shoppers have snapped up all the potatoes in those
establishments. Those few potatoes still in Moscow's markets are
grown in private plots by farmers who are charging more than three
times the state price.
   Rooting in the field for potatoes is not humiliating work, said
Gorodetsky, who lives in the surrounding Solnechnogorsk region but
grew up in a village.
   ``I like to do it,'' he said. ``I like being the master of the
soil. No one forces me. This is the Russian character.''
   Yevgeny A. Nazarov, of the Moscow suburb of Khimki, also said he
would carry home two sacks.
   ``I'm here because potatoes are very expensive in the market and
because of the recent rumors that in the winter we won't have any,
so it's the only way to provide for one's family,'' said the
37-year-old aircraft designer who has a wife and two children.
   Nazarov, who said the potatoes would hold them for half the
winter, admitted to being frightened by reports of a winter of food
shortages but added: ``We hope the situation will change. I'm an
optimist.''

<TEXT>
   Lama al-Suleiman is angry at an
American woman soldier she saw on television.
   ``This woman said: `All those Saudis have got to know that
slavery time is over,''' Mrs. al-Suleiman snapped.
   She decried the image of Saudi Arabia abroad, saying: ``It's a
picture of being imprisoned, of women being beaten .... We're not
maltreated. We just need a little bit of change.''
   Some young Saudis say change could be one result as foreign
troops, including women, flood Saudi Arabia to confront Iraq.
   Other observers say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait might slow the
pace of change - the 15-year-old civil war in Lebanon and the 1979
revolution in Iran have made the Saudis skittish about aping the
West, seen here as the main cause of both upheavals.
   ``With the crisis, people will rethink what they're doing. It's
like walking on a knife blade,'' said lawyer Majid Ghazawi.
   However, other Saudis view the confrontation with Iraq as a
strong catalyst for change.
   ``Part of the basic education of any nation is to go through a
crisis to mature,'' said Nidhal Taibah, a 25-year-old architecture
student.
   In the meantime, young Saudis point out how much Saudi Arabia
already has changed.
   ``Whatever you write, don't bring in tents, Bedouins or
camels,'' Mrs. al-Suleiman said.
   Young men and women acknowledge that their lives, from studying
to working to attitudes toward sex, are packaged by rigid social
and religious codes that many would like relaxed.
   But the tribal hierarchy frowns on public debate, much less
rebellion, so they say they'll have to wait until the whole country
wants to alter its ways.
   Free speech, women driving, more public mingling between the
sexes, a more flexible educational system, greater access to the
arts and late marriages are all on their agenda.
   ``You can force change from the top, but if you do it too fast
you tear the social fabric,'' said a young official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Saudi Arabia has no taxes. Work hours are limited and long
vacations are not unusual. Government housing loans are
interest-free. The state pays for medicine and education. College
students get stipends of $266 a month.
   Saudis acknowledge the largesse breeds complacency.
   ``We have to put some of the blame on ourselves for not
demanding the things we want,'' said Manal Fakeeh, a 24-year-old
manager at a hospital.
   Recent graduates said they got a basic university education
here. But many, especially the women, said their choices were
limited and classes uninspiring.
   ``They think engineering's too tough for women to handle,'' said
Mrs. al-Suleiman, who is pursuing a master's degree in
biochemistry.
   Because women are not permitted to mingle with men under
strictly observed Islamic law, they watch their professors on
closed-circuit television.
   ``It's more like corresponding than attendance,'' Mrs. Fakeeh
said.
   ``With time you don't feel you have the right to ask for what
you want because you think this is only for boys,'' said Dina bin
Mahfouz, a 25-year-old sociology graduate.
   ``If you think you have the right, people will let you know
you're extreme, moving out of society, trying to change things.
They don't like change.''
   Both men and women said they face intense pressure to get
married after graduation. Marriage, although no longer arranged, is
still a family affair where the woman's reputation is everything.
Premarital sex is almost unknown.
   ``It's a big no-no. It's something that doesn't happen,'' Taibah
said. ``If it happened in Riyadh, you'd hear about it in Jiddah.''
   ``You have to be a virgin because you're a Moslem. I wouldn't
even think of it,'' Miss bin Mahfouz said.
   Many young Saudis accept the morality of Islam, but reject the
ways its rules have been interpreted.
   No one will criticize the government directly for the record.
But many regret what they see as a timid stance on reform and the
toleration of religious teachers who issue bizarre statements like
one proclaiming the world is flat.
   While princes are accessible, public debate and any hint of
political organizing is squashed. Those who push too hard for
change have their passports confiscated and are ostracized.
   ``You don't tell the ogre its eyes are red,'' said one young
Saudi who has been behind bars. He spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   A flood of criticism of a pay-as-you-spray scheme
to activate the city's Claude and Mildred Pepper Fountain with
credit cards hasn't splashed cold water on the plan.
   The idea came up two weeks ago because the city says it can't
afford to spend the $42 an hour or so it costs to run the $3.2
million fountain, whose computer-controlled water jets are designed
to mimic the sea.
   And city commissioners appear prepared to at least consider the
proposal to install a machine like a bank's automatic teller,
despite a deluge of ridicule.
   ``It's the most preposterous thing I've ever heard of in my
entire life,'' said Howard Kleinberg, former editor of the Miami
News and now a history columnist for The Miami Herald. ``To think
of the endless possibilities this opens to credit cards!''
   As plastic as the plan may seem, the commissioners are
considering it as a sort of user fee to save taxpayers' dollars. As
it stands, no money is budgeted in the tight fiscal year that
started Monday to run the fountain named after the late Miami
congressman and his wife.
   City Manager Cesar Odio said his $269 million budget just can't
spare the $370,000 a year it would cost to keep the fountain
running.
   ``We can only afford to run it about two minutes a day,'' he
quipped.
   The city is in the midst of its worst financial squeeze in at
least 10 years. So why not let those who want to muse before the
mists pay for the pleasure?
   ``I don't see anything negative about it,'' said Commissioner
J.L. Plummer.
   The fountain, at Bayfront Park in the heart of the tourist
district, was switched on in July, and runs just several hours a
day. The rest of the time it sits idle, its empty moat attracting
skateboarders, its saucer-shaped granite centerpiece dry.
   An electrical contracting firm whose principals are active in
civic affairs suggested the credit-card scheme.
   ``I hate to see the city of Miami get a black eye over this,''
said Paco Farach, president of the company, Edd Helms Electrical
Contracting Inc. ``The credit card thing is an interim solution to
attract attention and create initial excitement.''
   Farach says the company would guarantee to run the fountain at
least 3,000 hours during the next three years at a cost of about
$150,000. And it has offered $10,000 to start a corporate
sponsorship program that would allow the credit-card machine to
offer discounts to employees of companies that sign up as sponsors.
   He envisions a machine that would take VISA, American Express
and MasterCard.
   The concept would have greatly disturbed the late Isamu Noguchi,
said Shoji Sadao, the architect who worked with the sculptor on the
fountain.
   ``He'd be very upset and very disappointed and just completely
discouraged,'' said Sadao. ``It certainly is a last resort. If I
had my choice, I would not want to have something that's for the
public having to be funded by private citizens. But if it gets down
to either that way or no fountain at all, then I'd have to go with
that choice.''
   One fan of the fountain is Bryn McKim, a recent transplant from
Oregon, who loves to spend her lunch hour in the sun, reading next
to the spray.
   ``Sure, I'd use an ATM machine,'' McKim said. ``I've never heard
of anything like that before. But, hey, you have to try new
things.''
   Pointing to the dry fountain, McKim said, ``Like that, it looks
like a meteor struck the park.''
   Jeff Homer, whose nearby office building faces the fountain,
disagrees.
   ``It seems tacky,'' Homer said of the credit-card plan. ``If
they found all that money to build this, they should be able to
find the money to keep it going.''

<HEAD>Political Landscale of Northeast Asia Changing</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY SMITH TUNNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strategically located Korean
peninsula is in the vortex of rapidly developing new relationships
that may change the political landscape of Northeast Asia.
   For the first time since the end of World War II, countries that
have been bitter adversaries and battleground enemies are talking
to one another. Delicate relations are being slowly, cautiously
realigned.
   Northeast Asia is unique in that it engages the vital interests
of four of the world's great powers: the United States, the Soviet
Union, Japan and China. The tense and bitterly divided Korean
peninsula sits at its geographical heart.
   All four countries are involved in, and will be affected by,
changes in Korea. All four governments have an interest in security
and peace on the peninsula and all four have economic reasons for
wanting to encourage friendly ties between North and South Korea.
   The result is a gradual restructuring of alliances, some of them
unthinkable as recently as two or three years ago.
   South Korea and the Soviet Union established full diplomatic
relations on Sunday for the first time since Russia and the Yi
Dynasty broke off ties in 1905. The announcement followed by three
days North Korea's stated intention to open talks on normalizing
relations with Japan.
   The two moves are seen as catalysts in breaking down Cold War
barriers and point toward the possibility of eventual recognition
of the rival Koreas by the others' allies - the United States and
Japan recognizing North Korea, and Beijing and Moscow recognizing
South Korea.
   The surge in political activity comes as the divided Germanys
unite, an event that holds deep emotional significance for all
Koreans who feel shamed at the division of Korea.
   The mending of decades of distrust between two Koreas with
starkly opposing ideologies is not expected to be quick or easy.
President Roh Tae-woo hopes to see unification by the end of the
century. Dissidents and radical students who harp on immediacy say
it will take five years.
   ``Confrontation and tensions continue to hamper the relations
between the two divided parts of Korea,'' said Roh said on Monday.
   But he said new ties will make it ``impossible for North Korea
alone to resist the tidal wave of change.''
   Prime Ministers of the Koreas held talks in September, the
highest-level contact ever between the two nations. A second round
of talks is scheduled for this month.
   Because of its geography, Korea long has served both as a buffer
and an invasion route for its powerful neighbors. In the last
century alone, three wars have been fought on Korean territory. For
35 years until 1945, Korea was occupied by the Japanese.
   The peninsula was divided in 1945 and in 1950 North Korea
invaded the south, launching a three-year civil war that left more
than 4 million people killed and wounded. A peace treaty was never
signed.
   The border remains tightly sealed. Distrust and suspicion are
rampant. There is no mail, telephone, communication or travel
between the two sides.
   The long-sought impetus for change has been the need for money
and technology.
   North Korea is virtually bankrupt. Wealthy Japan, just 350 miles
away, could provide desperately needed capital and technology.
Japan could find in North Korea cheap labor, raw materials and a
land route into Asia.
   The Soviet Union, also in need of capital, has found in South
Korea a willing investor as well as factories anxious to build and
market high technology.
   The Seoul government reportedly expects to sign an agreement for
more than $2 billion in aid to Moscow. Some also see the Soviets'
ties to Seoul as bait for Japan, which has turned down Moscow's
overtures for investments.
   China, long-time ally of North Korea, needs to expand its
markets and is expected to open trade offices with Seoul before the
end of the year.
   South Korea hopes relations with both China and the Soviet Union
will stop Beijing and Moscow from vetoing its attempts to enter the
United Nations.
   For its part, Washington hopes eased tensions will insure
stability in the region, eventually allow a scaleback of 43,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and remove an excuse for
anti-Americanism.
   For South Korea, new relations with the Soviet Union are the
culmination of a vigorous two-year campaign to develop ties with
allies of the North.
   ``The ties between Seoul and Moscow will have significant
bearing on the charting of a new world order,'' said Kim Hak-joon,
a top aide to Roh. ``We are seeing new opportunities for progress
in Northeast Asia.''

   When Martin Meyer of Chicago set out
to join the French Foreign Legion, the legendary fighting force
enshrined in film and song, he faced one big hurdle: finding their
Paris outpost.
   It took Meyer 24 hours of wandering the French capital before he
stumbled upon Fort Norgent, and told the burly legionnaires inside
he had come to join up.
   ``I knocked on the gate,'' he recalled. ``They tell you to
wait.''
   It may not have been a glorious start to Meyer's stint in the
Foreign Legion, whose troops are the veterans of countless battles
in jungles and deserts the world over, their exploits made famous
in P.C. Wren's novel ``Beau Geste.''
   But now he is a 28-year-old corporal, and was among the first
legionnaires to land in Saudi Arabia as part of the multinational
force deployed to the region after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   There are 2,300 legionnaires among the French ground troops, and
Meyer is one of three Americans. The legion is 40 percent French
and 60 percent foreigners, culled from 90 nationalities.
   Like countless hard-living legionnaires before him, Meyer left
behind a troubled past.
   A native of Arvada, Colo., he crisscrossed the United States
with a mother and two brothers. He was the child of a broken home,
he said.
   ``We had a lot of family troubles,'' said Meyer. ``I've always
been the black sheep.''
   Five years ago, he said, his wife walked out on him in Mexico,
Mo., taking their baby with her.
   ``I just wanted to disappear,'' he said. ``I'll never see them
again.''
   He had first headd about the Foreign Legion during a three-year
stint with the U.S. Air Force in West Germany that ended in 1981,
and read about it in combat magazines.
   After his wife left, he said, he checked out a book on the
legion from the public library. He applied for a passport, and he
left Chicago on a chilly autumn day in 1985.
   In some ways, Meyer was a textbook recruit. Legion officials say
most applicants are mavericks who find they just do not fit into
society. False identities are not uncommon, nor are past brushes
with the law. Murderers and serious criminals are not welcome,
however.
   In Paris, once Meyer had passed an initial round of interviews
with the legion, they took away his possessions and shipped him
south to their headquarters in Aubagne. There, he underwent a
two-week round of physical and mental tests, and relentless
questioning.
   About half of the would-be volunteers are accepted. They agree
to stay in the force for at least five years. They learn French,
and undergo difficult, even brutal physical training.
   Legionnaires get regular army pay. Afterward, they are
recommended for French citizenship.
   Formed in 1831 by King Louis-Philippe, the legion lost some of
its luster in recent years with France's bruising defeats in
Algeria and Vietnam. But a modern-day legionnaire is still likely
to see action in France's far-flung former possessions.
   Six months after joining, Meyer was sent to the former French
colony of Djibouti, on the Red Sea, then the African nations of
Chad and Gabon.
   The legionnaires arriving in Saudi Arabia are heading for the
front in armoured personal carriers with some light artillery.
   ``We are very... I'm losing my English,'' said Meyer, searching
for the word, ``... expendable. We are the front-line forces.''
   He has never seen combat. He hopes he will, in the Saudi desert.
   ``I love it. This is what we trained for,'' he said. ``I just
hope they let us do it.''
   He does have one worry - chemical weapons. Iraq is known to
possess them, and has used them in combat.
   ``But we have to be ready for anything,'' he said. ``If it's a
man-to-man, troop-to-troop battle, we will win.''

   Dozens of KGB and police officers
gathered recently around the blue mosque in Tashkent's crumbling
old city and listened warily as an Islamic cleric boomed out a call
for political action.
   ``Allah Akbar (God Is Great!)'' shouted thousands of male voices
in response to the mullah's call for Islam to replace Communism.
   A few miles from the mosque, workers were building an iron and
concrete fence around the Uzbekistan Communist Party headquarters,
which local newspapers report is being converted to a presidential
palace.
   Workers said the fence will be electrified to hold back any mobs
that might attack Uzbek leaders, as Romanian mbs did during a
revolution in that Balkan nation last year.
   ``They fear the Romanian variant,'' said Abdulrashid Sharif of
Berlik, an Uzbek popular movement. He said public anger was rising
against the reported corruption of Uzbekistan's Communist
leadership.
   Uzbekistan, a central Asian republic of 20 million about the
size of soon-to-be united Germany, is a backwater of poverty at the
edge of the democratic reform sweeping other parts of the Soviet
Union.
   Some local leaders have called for political unity among the
Central Asian republics against the ethnic Russian-dominated
leadership in Moscow. Unrest already has broken out in three areas
of Uzbekistan, and the republic's Communist officials appear to be
girding for more demonstrations.
   ``We see on television what is happening in the Baltics, in
Russia and Moldavia,'' Sharif said.
   Unlike their counterparts in the Baltic and Russian republics,
the Uzbek Communist Party has kept its grip on power. It banned
demonstrations in February and suppressed a democratic opposition
movement, activists said.
   ``In Uzbekistan, the power of the Communists has not changed
since the days of stagnation,'' said activist Igor Kadirov, who
lives in the industrial city of Almalyk. The ``period of
stagnation'' is the Soviet term for the 1964-82 rule of Leonid
Brezhnev.
   Uzbekistan's per capita income is half the Soviet average, and
10 percent of the population is jobless. Many of the high-paying
jobs in the gold and gas fields go to Russians rather than the
native Uzbeks. The Uzbeks make up 69 percent of the population,
Russians 11 percent, with the rest a mixture of ethnic groups.
   The gas and gold produced in Uzbekistan is controlled by the
central government in Moscow, with few benefits flowing to the
people of Uzbekistan, said poet Yodgor Obid, a member of Berlik.
Natural gas lines to Russia pass right through Uzbek villages which
have no gas themselves.
   Uzbek reformers have their eyes on the new president of the
Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, who quit the Communist Party in
July and has persuaded the legislature to approve sweeping
political and economic changes.
   But Uzbek Communist leaders have suppressed the local democratic
movement, reformers say.
   While tens of thousands were allowed to march to the Kremlin
walls in July and September to denounce Communism, demonstrations
in Uzbekistan have been banned since February.
   The Uzbek Communist Party says its publishing house - the only
one in the republic capable of printing newspapers - will refuse to
print national publications it does not approve of. Kadirov said
the new national law on freedom of the press, which took effect in
August, is being ignored in Uzbekistan.
   Leaders of Berlik, the popular movement that claims 1.5 million
members, said members are often arrested and beaten by police.
   Uzbekistan already has exploded in ethnic, economic and
political violence in the Fergana, Andizhan and Parkent areas. As
many as 800 were killed in June in Uzbek-Kirgiz clashes in Osh,
just over the border in Kirgizia.
   Locals say such bloody outbursts could recur.
   ``The situation is very dangerous and tense,'' said Damin
Narzikolov, a Berlik leader.
   The tension is causing many ethnic Russians to flee. They crowd
the Tashkent rail office every day, arranging their moves back
home.
   ``We're afraid. It's dangerous to walk on the streets,'' said
railworker Yuri Yurtaev, an ethnic Russian.
   ``We have nothing against Russians who want to work,'' said
Yodgor Obid. ``But those who want to command, as a colonial power -
those can go.''
   Despite the efforts of Uzbek authorities to control dissent,
more and more infrmation is being published on corruption among
officials. Newspapers recently disclosed that for the past 30
years, only children of the party elite have been accepted to
prestigious foreign language and law schools.
   The Soviet press has carried numerous stories about official
corruption in Uzbekistan, and many of the republic's top leaders
were convicted for collecting payments for non-existent cotton.
   The gradual lifting of restrictions on religion has freed Moslem
leaders to move into politics, leading Russians and non-Moslems to
worry they will follow the lead of nearby Iran into religious
fundamentalism.
   Signs of fundamentalism were visible at the blue mosque, where
young Moslem men glared in fury at a foreign woman escorted briefly
into the service by an Islamic official.

<HEAD>30,000 Hindu Outcastes Convert to Buddhism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30,000 Hindus considered
``untouchables'' in the country's rigid caste system have adopted
Buddhism in the largest mass conversion in nearly a decade,
according to news reports.
   The ceremony took place Saturday in Agra, the site of the Taj
Mahal, about 110 miles south of New Delhi.
   The Indian Express newspaper said the conversions were prompted
by clashes in June with upper-caste Hindus near Agra.
   Seven people were killed and 110 were injured in the three-day
riots that began when a wedding procession was attacked by
upper-caste Hindus protesting the noise.
   Welcoming the converts, a local politician, Sangh Priya Gautam,
said Buddhism was the only religion based on ``realism and
equality,'' Press Trust of India reported.
   The converts, called Harijans, were below the complex Hindu
caste system that determines a person's social standing by birth,
and often affects economic position.
   Harijans are not assigned any caste, making them
``untouchables'' for the higher-born Hindus. In many Indian
villages, the so-called outcastes are not allowed to use umbrellas
or wear shoes when in an upper-caste neighborhood.
   Despite official government rejection of the caste system, it is
prevalent in rural India. Efforts by Harijans to assert their
rights have often led to clashes with the upper castes.
   University students who belong to upper castes have also been
protesting - some by self-immolation - an August government decree
setting aside 49 percent of civil service jobs for low-caste
workers.
   Saturday's ceremony took place while Hindus celebrated one of
their most important festivals, the Dusshera, which marks the
victory of good over evil.
   About 60 monks supervized the conversion, the largest since
1981, when about 300,000 low-caste Hindus embraced Buddhism in the
western town of Nagpur.
   There are about 4.7 million Buddhists in India, comprising less
than 1 percent of India's 800 million people.
   Hindus make up about 82 percent of the population.
   Buddhism, which does not have castes, was founded in India as a
religion and philosophy about 2,500 years ago by Siddhartha
Gautama. It teaches the practice of meditation and observance of
moral principles.

   Yosemite National Park
celebrates its 100th birthday Monday, hundreds of millions of years
after the formation of the Sierra Nevada that glaciers later carved
into majestic valleys.
   The 748,542-acre park was created by Congress on Oct. 1, 1890,
26 years after the federal government gave Yosemite Valley to
California for use as a public park and recreation area. The park
is about 130 miles east of San Francisco.
   John Muir, a naturalist, first saw the area in the 1860s and his
enthusiastic reports help spark interest in preserving Yosemite.
Now, some 3.4 million people visit the park each year.
   During the past century, Yosemite has seen controversies and
disasters. Development interests and concessionaires have battled
environmentalists about how much to build in the park. This summer,
a fire raged through Yosemite, closing the valley for 11 days and
burning 23,000 acres.
   But the park that includes El Capitan, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls
- one of the world's tallest waterfalls - has survived, its granite
rock faces and tall trees reaching ever upward.
   ``We believe we've seen 100 years of preservation, and we're
working hard to ensure that the next 100 years are even going to be
better for the visitors and the park,'' said Yosemite
Superintendent Michael Finley.
   A ceremony marking the milestone will be held Monday.
   The Sierra was created hundreds of millions of years ago when
the Earth's plates collided, according to generally accepted
scientific theory. Ice ages then came, unleashing glaciers tens of
thousands of years ago.

<HEAD>Analysts Say War More Likely as Iraq Driven Into Corner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The likelihood of war in the Persian Gulf has
grown significantly as sanctions and a hostile world push Saddam
Hussein into a corner with no diplomatic escape, European and
Israeli military analysts say.
   But they say there is still a window for peace, before the
effects of sanctions sink in further and U.S.-led forces in Saudi
Arabia become strong enough to consider launching a military
operation to push Iraq out of Kuwait.
   ``I think another six to eight weeks is available to prevent a
conflict, but after that it becomes almost inevitable,'' said Paul
Beaver, publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly.
   With the United Nations demanding an unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait and Iraq reiterating almost daily that it
will never leave, the analysts see little room for a negotiated
solution.
   ``Saddam Hussein could well now be driven into a corner which
makes negotiations difficult and we could see a situation where he
is left with very few options - and those all being of a military
nature,'' Beaver said in an interview.
   Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for
International Relations in Paris, said he would ``love to see a
diplomatic option'' but ``it would mean that ... Saddam Hussein
gives in to Western pressure, and it's rather unlikely.''
   A compromise is still possible, he said, in which Iraq would
withdraw in return for agreement to hold an international
conference to redefine Kuwait's boundaries, give Iraq access to the
sea and redistribute Kuwaiti oil reserves.
   ``But I do not see it in the cards right now,'' Moisi said.
``Maybe in the very beginning a diplomatic option might have been
open. Now it's a bit late.''
   Even if Iraq withdraws from Kuwait, which would satisfy the
United Nations, the rest of the world has to be assured that Saddam
doesn't have the potential to strike again or continue developing
nuclear and chemical weapons, Beaver said.
   Col. Andrew Duncan, assistant director for information at the
International Institute of Strategic Studies, endorsed what he
called a scattershot search for a peaceful solution being pursued
by individuals and groups in the Arab world and the West.
   But ``both the United Nations and the Arab League have got to be
the major players in the solution,'' he said.
   Iraq believes support for the U.N. embargo will eventually
crack, said Ian Anthony, a researcher at the Stockholm Peace
Research Center.
   ``Iraq's agenda now is to change the situation so radically in
Kuwait that it can never be put back to where it was,'' Anthony
said. He said Iraq recently tried to depopulate Kuwait by opening
its borders. Baghdad has also moved large numbers of Palestinians
into Kuwait to change the population balance.
   Moisi said he believes American objectives can only be achieved
through war.
   ``So unfortunately, I think that war is the most probable
outcome although paradoxically, no one really wants it,'' he said.
   American military leaders ``are obsessed'' with the limitations
imposed by the government on the U.S. military during the Vietnam
War, ``and are not likely to engage in a war ... without using all
the means at their disposal,'' Moisi said.
   Duncan said Iraq missed its best chance to attack Saudi Arabia
immediately after its Aug. 2 invasion, when the Americans were not
yet on the scene.
   The U.S.-led forces now ``are just about in position to defend
Saudi Arabia but a lot more is required before an offensive
operation to retake Kuwait,'' Beaver said.
   U.S. ground forces are not strong enough, Duncan said, and it
will be at least a month before enough tanks to face the Iraqis
arrive in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The world alliance ... will not even be prepared for a
military action until sometime in November,'' said Joseph Alpher,
deputy head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv
University.
   The ideal option for U.S.-led forces would be to wait for Iraq
to make the first move and respond, which would be more popular in
the West, and especially in the Arab world, analysts said.
   ``But I don't think it will be a prerequisite for a U.S. and
allied action,'' Alpher said.
   If the mulinational force attacks, a U.S.-led air strike
followed by a ground attack would almost certainly be used to try
to recapture Kuwait, the analysts agreed.
   ``Will it be on Kuwait or will it be on Iraq itself? I think all
options are open,'' Moisi said.
   An attack by Arab terrorists could also trigger a war, the
analysts said.
   Israel also has to give credence to Saddam's threat to attack
Israel if the embargo strangles his country, Alpher said.
   ``I think the danger is to underestimate Saddam Hussein, to
believe he will be a fool,'' Moisi said. ``He has not been a fool
so far.''

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Toasts 41 Years of Communist Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   As much of the world retreats from Communism,
Chinese Premier Li Peng has toasted the party's 41-year rule with
praise for its ``great, glorious and correct'' leadership.
   Li also lauded the army and police for their roles in
controlling dissent and implementing new anti-crime measures.
   Li made the toast Sunday at an annual reception for foreign
diplomats on the eve of the anniversary of the 1949 birth of the
People's Republic of China following the overthrow of the
Nationalist government.
   Athletes from China's Asian Games team also attended and mingled
with the top leaders, who begged for autographs. The 36-nation
games are under way in Beijing and scheduled to close Oct. 7.
   The Communist Party turned ``an impoverished, backward old China
which was subjected to the bullying and enslavement by colonialism
and imperialism, into a socialist new China with initial
prosperity,'' Li said in his 15-minute toast.
   ``The Communist Party of China is a great, glorious and correct
party. We have every ability to manage our own affairs well and
socialist China has a bright future full of infinite promise,'' he
said.
   Chinese leaders maintain that the collapse of socialism in
Eastern Europe is only a temporary setback, and capitalism will
eventually fail. Since putting down a pro-democracy movement in
1989, Chinese officials have kept tight controls on any dissent and
filled the official media with praise of the party.
   The premier's annual National Day toast serves as an abridged
state-of-the-nation address, summarizing China's political and
economic situation and the basic domestic and foreign policies.
   This year's toast contained no surprises, reaffirming the
government's determination to maintain a planned economy.
   Li said the government was intensifying efforts to complete a
new Five-Year Plan for submission to the party Central Committee.
He gave no explanation for the plan's delay, believed to be the
result of sharp disagreement over resuming market-style economic
reforms. The new plan is due to take effect in January.
   Li praised an anti-crime campaign that has resulted in more than
650 death sentences being handed down from January to August,
according to the human rights group Amnesty International.
   In an unusual move, party General Secretary Jiang Zemin attended
the reception, held in the Great Hall of the People. The annual
event generally is considered a state affair, rather than a party
function.
   The exiled leader of Cambodia's rebel resistance, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, also attended and sat between Jiang and Li.
   Sihanouk said several weeks ago that he was ailing and would
take a leave of absence from political and diplomatic activities.
He showed no sign of illness, however, maintaining a brisk
conversation with Jiang.
   Several party elders were absent, including Vice President Wang
Zhen, 82. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 86, has retired from all
party and government posts and has not attended in years.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>Size:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Saves $40 billion in the fiscal year that begins Monday, $500
billion over the next five years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Components:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For the five years, $134 billion of the taxes will come from new
taxes and fees; $182 billion from defense and domestic programs,
almost all of it expected to come from defense; $119 billion from
entitlement benefit programs like Medicare; and $65 billion from
resulting lowered payments on the debt.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>New taxes:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline tax, now 9 cents per gallon, up 5 cents Dec. 1, 2 cents
Jan. 1 and an additional 5 cents next July 1. Cigarette tax, now 16
cents per pack, up 4 cents in 1991 and another 4 cents in 1993.
   The 16-cent tax on six-packs of beer rises to 36 cents, the
$12.50 per gallon hard liquor tax goes up $1.20, and the 3-cent tax
on a bottle of wine goes up to 24 cents, all in January.
   Cars worth more than $30,000, private boats exceeding $100,000,
furs and jewelry exceeding $5,000 face a 10 percent on their value
exceeding those levels. Tax applies to newly manufactured items.
   Individuals or couples earning more than $100,000 could lose 3
percent of their deductions for their income over that amount.
   The 1.45 percent tax taken out of paychecks to support the
Medicare program would apply up to $73,000 in annual earnings. It
now applies only up to $51,300.
   The largest increase in federal fees will be an increase in the
amount the government charges banks to insure deposits, a boost
that will garner $4 billion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Tax breaks:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For companies that do business in deteriorating urban and rural
areas, search for energy or do research. Special credits for small
companies. Slight increase in the earned income tax credit, used by
low-income people.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Medicare:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The program providing medical care for the elderly and disabled
will be cut $60 billion, half for recipients, half for doctors and
hospitals. The bulk of the government's savings for recipients
comes from two areas. The monthly $28.60 premium for doctors' bill
will increase to about $34.30, although not for the poorest people.
Also, recipients will have to shoulder the first $150 in each
year's doctors' bills, up from $75 now.

   Here is a transcript of remarks made by
President Bush and congressional leaders Sunday at a Rose Garden
ceremony announcing a budget agreement between the White House and
congressional negotiators:
   I am joined here today by the leadership of the Congress - the
speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, the Senate
repubican leader, the president pro tem of the Senate, the House
majority leader, and the House Republican leader and other members
of the budget summit negotiating group.
   The bipartisan leaders and I have reached agreement on the
federal budget.
   Over five years, it would reduce the projected deficit by $500
billion. That is half a trillion dollars.
   The agreement has five basic parts.
   First it would save $119 billion in entitlement and mandatory
programs.
   Second, it would produce $182 billion in discretionary program
savings. These savings would come principally from defense. In the
next three years defense outlays would be reduced by $67 billion
relative to the projected baseline.
   All other discretionary programs would be firmly capped at the
projected baseline level. That is, for the next three years, they
would in total be allowed to grow at no more than the inflation
rate.
   Third, the agreement would increase tax revenues by $134
billion. The largest single increase, single contributor would be a
phased-in increase in the gasoline tax of five cents per gallon in
the first year and another five cents in the following years.
   I do not welcome any such tax measure, nor do I expect anybody
up here does.
   However, this one does have the virtue not only of contributing
to deficit reduction but also, overtime, of decreasing America's
dependence on foreign oil, an objective whose importance has become
increasingly evident in the face of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   I am pleased to be able to note that the budget agreement also
includes several new incentives to increase domestic exploration
and development of our own gas resources.
   The combination of these measures should help reduce America's
vulnerability to the interruption of supplies of foreign oil
imports.
   Fourth, the agreement extends the Gramm-Rudman budget discipline
for five years.
   In addition, it improves the budget process and substantially
strengthens the enforceability of the five-year budget plan to
which we have agreed.
   Fifth, this agreement includes important new initiatives to
stimulate economic growth.
   It authorizes new tax incentives for the development of
enterprise zones, extends the r&amp;d tax credit, it provides powerful
new incentives in the kinds of companies that account for most of
America's job growth.
   These incentives include a new 30 percent credit for r&amp;d, 25
percent deduction for the purchase of new equity, indexing of the
basis of new stock in such companies, expansion of investment in
tangible equipment and scientific equipment, a minimum basis rule.
It encourages investment in new ventures and in companies with
high-growth potential and other such incentives.
   In addition to these targeted-growth incentives, I would note
that prompt enactment of this entire five-year deficit-reduction
package would itself help stimulate long-term economic growth.
   With a half-a-trillion dollars in real deficit reduction - and
let me repeat, the leaders here and I think that these are real
deficit reduction figures - long-term interest rates should be able
to come down.
   This package should be a strong component of a positive,
responsible fiscal and monetary policy.
   I heartily thank the negotiators who have worked so long and so
hard to develop this package. The bipartisan congressional
leadership and I have pledged our very best to get this entire
package signed into law by October 19th.
   As any such plan would have to, ours requires that virtually
everyone contribute in some way. It is balanced, it is fair, and in
my view it is what the United States of America needs at this point
in its history. And we are united in our fim determination to see
this program enacted.
   I do not want to imply that some who have not been in the final
negotiations are for every part of this, but I can only speak for
my part and then the top leadership here will speak.
   But I will simply say: this is priority. This is priority for
our nation. This is something that the country is calling out for
and world markets are looking for.
   And so there will be some tough fights ahead. But I have pledged
to the speaker, to Congressman Gephardt, to Bob Michel on our side,
to George Mitchell and Bob Dole and the Senate pro tem leader,
Senator Byrd, that I will do everything I can to lay aside
partisanship here and to take this, take the case for this deal to
the American people in every way I can.
   Sometimes you just don't get it just the way you want. And this
is such a time for me, and I suspect such a time for everybody
standing here.
   But it's time put the interests of the United States of America
first and get this deficit under control. And Mr. Speaker, I'm
grateful to you, the Democrats and the Republicans for seeing that
the interests of this country come first.
   Thank you for what you've been doing and I'd appreciate it if
you want to say a few words.

<TEXT>
   
   Speaker of the House Tom Foley:
   Thank you very much Mr. President, I'll be brief in just echoing
what you have yourself just said sir.
   This is a package that your negotiators and the bipartisan
participating negotiators from the House and the Senate ranking
Republican members, chairmen and the leadership on both sides have
sought to achieve.
   It's not going to be easy or simple to obtain the votes that are
necessary in both the House and the Senate, the majority of both
parties in both bodies, that will have to be found to enact this
package and within the next three weeks.
   But we pledge our efforts with yours to convince our colleagues
and the country that this is strong undergirding of our economic
future, our national prosperity and joint national interests. And
in that spirit we are going to begin today to present to you
legislation which will allow the orderly functioning of the federal
government for the continuation of this next week in preparing to
take the first step to implement this program.
   I want to pay a word, if I can, a special thanks to all my
colleagues who participated in this, and especially to Dick
Gephardt, the chairman of these budget negotiations who all sides,
Republicans and Democrats, Senators and House members and you
yourself have spoken eloquently to his patience and leadership.
   Thank you sir, for your involvement and your determination to
aid in the process of bringing this package in the interest of the
country to final achievement.
   
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell:
   Thank you Mr. President.
   Now comes the hard part. It's one thing to get a budget
agreement among ourselves, for which all involved should be
commended.
   It's another thing to get the votes to pass it through the House
and the Senate. That is a task to which we must now commit
ourselves.
   This agreement is a compromise. Both sides can accurately say
that the agreement includes provisions they don't like. Both sides
can also accurately say the agreement doesn't include some
provisions they think should be included.
   Cutting the deficit requires difficult choices but our nation's
economic future requires that we make those choices.
   We have already debated too long. Now we must act decisively.
   
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole:
   Mr. President, thank you very much and I want to thank my
colleagues, and again particularly Dick Gephardt.
   The nay sayers, the nit pickers may have a field day because the
easy vote in this case is to find something you don't like and vote
no.
   But in my view we owe more to the American people than finding
fault with what I consider to be a good agreement. Good positive,
solid agreement, that in my view will help the American economy and
demonstrate to the American people, who are sometime somewhat
cynical, that the congress and the president and of the United
States can work together and we can look ahead and we can do the
right thing for our country.
   And so I would hope that my colleagues, and I speak now to my
colleagues, certainly will study this document very carefully, will
give it their best effort and when the roll is called that we will
have a majority of Republicans and Democrats for this outstanding
package.
   Thank you, Mr. President.
   
   
   House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt:
   Forty years ago a mountaineer who joined in the first successful
climb of Mt. Everest explained the success by saying, ``no
expedition enjoyed better teamwork.''
   To the speaker of the House, Congressman Foley, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, to the members of Congress who are here
with us on the stage, to the administration and their
representatives and the great staffs of all sides who worked so
long and so hard with us, you have been heroic as we've made this
climb together.
   The American people are today asking why was this summit
necessary, why did it take so long and what did it achieve?
   If we are to enact this agreement, and I think we must, these
questions must be answered persuasively and honestly.
   For ten years we have chosen a course together that has created
large deficits and limited our capacity to meet the needs of our
people and the demands of a very challenging age.
   Today we face a weakened economy and high rates of interest and
inflation. Tomorrow, in absence of an agreement, massive
across-the-board budget cuts would occur.
   The alternative to this agreement is fiscal chaos. To meet our
responsibility to America's working families, this summit simply
had to succeed.
   What delayed us for months is what has divided us for a decade.
The parties to these talks had and continue to have deep
disagreements over values, the role of government and the fairness
of our taxes. But we all made compromise in the national interest.
   To bring this process to a successful conclusion, all of us, the
American people and our national leaders must accept the
responsibilities of the day.
   And as this debate unfolds I hope this will be said - that we
achieved the largest deficit-reduction package in our history. That
we focused the national debate on whether the tax code will be
based on everybody's individual ability to pay. That vital issues,
investing in our people, making our nation competitive and
realizing social justice will rise again on the national agenda and
that enactment of this measure will enable us to confront these
important issues successfully in the years to come.
   I thank you, Mr. President and I thank all of the members of the
summit.
   
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel:
   Thank you Mr. President and my colleagues.
   I support the package wholeheartedly because I was one of the
narrower group that within the last days, last ten days or so, made
some of the final decisions.
   There may be some reservations with respect to some of our other
   summiteers on the platform. I think probably rightly so because
we're making decisions that reach far out into five years.
   Everyone is entitled to know exactly what we have wrought in the
printed word. As a matter of fact, I don't have, wasn't privy to
the last few lines that were written early this morning.
   But, on balance, when I look at what we were originally faced
with and here we are refraining from increasing marginal rates and
not touching the unmentionable out there - Social Security.
   And then to have the incentives for growth that I see here and
the expenditure caps over the next several years, that are real and
enforceable, it seems to me that in the alternative so much better
that we've done what we've done and hopefully that in the ensuing
days we'll be able to sell a majority of the members on both sides
of the aisle in both houses to give us the affirmative, both that I
think is so imperative that I think that we have before we adjourn.
   
   President Bush:
   Thank you all very much and let me conclude by singling out the
White House team by name - Secretary Brady and Dick Darman, John
Sununu, who stayed in there day in and day out with the members of
Congress.
   In my view they did an outstanding job too.
   You know, Sen. Bentsen said in this meeting, I it's not
betraying a confidence, that he hoped that I would do my level best
to take this case to the American people.
   And I told him inside what I want to repeat here - that I will
do everything I can to generate support from the American people
for this compromise.
   I am convinced that the American people do not want to see us
continue to mortgage the futures of their children and their
grandchildren.
   And as I say compromise is the word here. All of us have had to
do that.
   But to Sen. Bentsen I said in there and I would say here
publicly, I want the American people to understand how important we
feel this is.
   I want them to understand this is real. This is not a phony
smoke and mirrors deficit-cutting program and I will do everything
in my power to help the leadership, Republican and Democrat, get
this passed in the United States Congress.
   Thank you all very much for coming.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breadlines are forming in the streets of
Washington these days. But this isn't a story about poverty. To the
contrary.
   This is about people who, to their own amused astonishment, are
willing to wait an hour to lay out $3.75 for a two-pound loaf of
rye.
   ``It's bizarre,'' exults baker Mark Furstenberg, surveying
people streaming hopefully into his Marvelous Market, even though
the sign on the door proclaims, ``Sorry - no more bread.''
   Furstenberg, 52, started selling bread on Connecticut Avenue
eight weeks ago - traditional French baguettes, boules and
brioches; fragrant rosemary bread; pungent sourdough full of black
olives; sweet fig and currant loaves; course-grained, slightly
bitter ryes; multigrain loaves. Handsome, hefty, old-fashioned
loaves of bread that cost $1.25 to $7.50.
   Initial production was 300 pounds a day. Now that the local
press has taken notice, the oven works from 11 p.m. through the
night and into the following afternoon, producing 1,200 pounds
daily. It still can't meet demand.
   Furstenberg is proving an old adage. But better bread is his
better mousetrap.
   Most days, the breadline forms an hour before opening time. The
overnight production is gone within a few hours.
   People who ordinarily would fuss about a five-minute wait in a
supermarket hang around for the fresh production. Satisfied, some
break off their first bite on the way out.
   The State Department, putting on a banquet, asked to buy an
entire day's output. Furstenberg refused; he wouldn't deprive his
neighborhood customers.
   Suburbanites drive in for the bread. The bakery rations sales to
two loaves per customer. Some make extravagant appeals for a third
loaf - ``for my pregnant sister who can't come in.'' They beg to
have bread air-expressed to distant relatives.
   ``Who are these people?'' Furstenberg asks in mock despair.
``After all, it's only bread.''
   But he knows who they are. For 30 years, he said, he'd heard
people say the same thing: ``You can't get good bread in
Washington.'' He said it himself.
   So he invested $80,000 in savings, borrowed more from a bank,
studied baking in France, traveled this country to sample loaves.
   He imported an oven from France and dispatched two employees to
spend a month in Los Angeles learning the craft from Nancy
Silverton, proprietor of famous La Brea Bakery, whose bread
Furstenberg most wanted to replicate.
   Business was good even before The Washington Post discovered
Marvelous Market and fell in love.
   The newspaper's Home section wrote about the bread on a
Thursday, the Food Section the following Wednesday and restaurant
reviewer Phyllis Richman on Sunday. (``Now Washington has
world-class bread.'') The New York Times also took approving
notice.
   That's when the lines started forming.
   One morning last week, Sylvia Mulhauser, a visitor from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., was asked if she ever thought she'd wait 45
minutes for bread.
   ``No,'' she said, ``and I never thought I'd pay $3.75 for a
loaf, either.''
   Asked why she'd do it, Mrs. Mulhauser spelled out her reasons:
``Crunchy. Chewy. Flavorful. Good texture.''

<HEAD>`Twin Peaks' Opener Leaves the Big Question Unanswered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Return with us now to the fictional town of Twin Peaks, where
nothing is quite what it seems and everyone is out to lunch.
   Food is still a central theme, although this time cherry pie has
taken a back seat to huckleberries. And half of Twin Peaks'
inhabitants are still playing life's card game without picture
cards.
   No, no one ever came right out and said who killed homecoming
queen Laura Palmer during Sunday night's two-hour season premiere
of ABC's truly bizaare soap opera.
   But then no one has ever accused ``Twin Peaks'' creators David
Lynch and Mark Frost of writing in declarative sentences.
   For Peaks freaks, though, Sunday's second season opener provided
a host of substantial, if sometimes incomprehensible, clues to
Palmer's murderer.
   First things first, however.
   No, pie-loving FBI agent Dale Cooper is not dead, despite taking
three slugs in last season's cliffhanger ending from an unknown
assailant at point-blank range.
   Yes, he was wearing a bulletproof vest. But it seems a
bothersome wood tick had caused Cooper some discomfort and he had
hitched up his vest to get at it.
   His unprotected abdomen was hit. This, though, did not stop him
from springing out of his hospital bed to find Palmer's killer.
   It did cause him to see a vision of a giant bathed in white
light who gave him three clues to the cosmic goings-on in Twin
Peaks. One of the profound nuggets: ``There's a man in a smiling
bag.''
   You hate to see that.
   The mill did indeed burn to the ground. And if you listened to
the recently released cassette of Cooper's dictated ramblings to
his secretary, you would have already known that consumate witch
Catherine Martell and mysterious widow Josie Packard are missing.
   Most of the other wacko residents are in comas or the hospital.
   Nadine Hurley survived her suicide attempt but is comatose. And
the reason she always wears that eye patch is that her husband
accidentally blinded her in one eye during a hunting trip that
doubled as their secret honeymoon.
   Catherine's long-suffering husband, Pete, suffered smoke
inhalation during the sawmill blaze, as did Shelly Johnson.
   Her wife-beating jerk of a husband, Leo, survived being shot,
but he's in a coma, too, and may be brain-damaged. Nothing new in
the latter development.
   OK, OK, back to Laura's killer. We know now that on the night of
her death, Palmer and co-worker Ronette Pulaski eventually ended up
blindfolded in an orgy with Leo and Jacques Renault (who now is
dead, too).
   A mysterious, long-haired third man showed up at the sexfest and
beat the blindfolded girls. Ronette escaped. Laura, obviously,
didn't.
   If you had read the X-rated (make that NC-17) ``Secret Diary of
Laura Palmer'' written by Lynch's 22-year-old daughter, Jennifer,
you also would have known that BOB - as Laura refers to him in her
diary - is most likely the killer.
   That is, if BOB is a real person and not the figment of Palmer's
cocaine-induced imagination.
   But true to form, the season premiere of ``Twin Peaks'' gave
viewers two things: beautiful pictures and an utterly confusing
script.
   Sunday's episode was directed by Lynch and written by Frost.
Next week, it moves to its new, regular time period of 10 p.m. on
Saturdays.

<TEXT>
   This country is on the brink of a famine
worse than the one that killed hundreds of thousands of Africans in
the mid-1980s - but the ruling junta refuses to acknowledge the
threat, diplomats and relief officials say.
   They say the military government's refusal to declare an
emergency is preventing the international aid community from
obtaining and distributing the million tons of food necessary to
head off the famine.
   They say up to 8 million Sudanese are at risk, and that the
famine is expected to peak by April. Some people already are
starving.
   ``This famine will be worse than (the Ethiopian-Sudanese famine
of) 1984-85 and the conditions to relieve it are 100 times worse,''
said a Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. officials in Washington say the junta is using food as a
weapon in its war with southern rebels. They accuse it of bombing
humanitarian relief sites in rebel areas, including a Red Cross
food barge.
   The Americans were outraged at a Sudanese request last week for
$150 million in food aid.
   ``I think it's almost unimaginable that a government facing a
disaster of epic proportions would have the audacity to bomb food
shipments at the same time they are asking for more food
assistance,'' said Andrew Natsios, head of the U.S. Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance.
   ``Half the country is starving to death,'' he said Thursday in
Washington. ``That is a recipe for massive political convulsions.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people died in the 1984-85 famine, and
more than 250,000 Sudanese died of disease and starvation two years
ago. The 1988 deaths occurred because both sides in Sudan's civil
war used the food weapon, denying famine relief to people in
territory controlled by the other side, Western relief officials
said.
   Many of the 26 million Sudanese are already suffering.
   Sudan's main staple, sorghum, is in short supply in many
markets. Farmers and nomadic cattle herders are selling off animals
because drought has destroyed grazing lands and sorghum is
unavailable or too expensive to feed them.
   Initial reports by foreign specialists say no fewer than 3
million people - and as many as 8 million - will be affected by the
expected famine.
   More than 2 million Sudanese are in makeshift camps around
Khartoum. More than half are southerners who have sought shelter
from famine and the 7-year-old civil war. The rest migrated from
the Kordofan region in the west during the mid-1980s drought.
   In recent weeks, 10,000 more - some showing clear signs of
malnutrition - have crowded into the camps in a generally fruitless
search for food.
   The threat of famine comes at a particularly bad time. Much
regular aid earmarked for Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's junta
has been cut back or stopped because of Sudan's lack of democracy,
human rights record and political isolation after its support of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Natsios and other U.S. officials accused Sudanese forces of
bombing the southern town of Bor, where international food relief
operations are under way, last week.
   Other air raids have taken place near U.N. food relief sites,
Natsios said.
   The presumed purpose of the bombing missions is to prevent the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army from diverting food meant for
starving civilians to its fighters. Like government soldiers in the
bush war, many rebels have lived on subsistence rations during
their long fight against northern domination.
   Western relief officials are pressing for government action to
allow the United Nations, Western donors and relief agencies to get
a relief campaign under way. They say at least $500 million must be
found to pay for purchase and distribution of a million tons of
food.
   Sudan's 1989 winter harvest of sorghum and other grains was less
than half 1988's bumper crop, and has not lasted until the next
harvest expected in November.
   The blow that guarantees a new disaster came in July, when
expected summer rains didn't come. They began, erratically and
meagerly, in September.
   ``With the late rains and insufficient quantities, maybe we will
get only 30 to 40 percent of the crop. Maybe not even that,'' said
Mukesh Sanghavi of the European development and relief agency
ACORD.
   Other Western relief officials estimated as little as 10 percent
of the yield can be realized.

   If this is Monday, it must be Carlos Menem of
Argentina. And Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay. And Borisav Jovic
of Yugoslavia. And the leaders of Italy and El Salvador. And on and
on.
   Those are just some of the fellow presidents George Bush was
meeting today on the final leg of his own version of the New York
Marathon.
   He saved time Sunday for a quick trot through the World Summit
for Children at the United Nations and a dash back to the White
House to close a $500 billion budget deal with the leaders of
Congress.
   But mostly what he did during three frenetic days was sit in an
easy chair in his 35th floor suite at the Waldorf Astoria holding
court with a score or more of presidents, prime ministers and even
a king.
   For all but a special few - including Prime Ministers Toshiki
Kaifu of Japan and Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain - it was a
15-minute shot. They were ushered in and out of the presidential
suite almost as fast as the State Department protocol squad could
change the ceremonial flags.
   This was no diplomatic minuet, it was a break dance - a chance
for Bush to strut his stuff with fellow movers and shakers in the
very hotel he called home two decades ago during his stint as the
permanent U.S. representative to the United Nations.
   
   ---
   
   Brian Mulroney dropped by Saturday evening - a late addition to
the schedule - and boasted that more than 70 world leaders were in
town for the children's summit, which the Canadian prime minister
helped pull together.
   ``Did you put the arm on all of them like you did on me?''
cracked Bush.
   Bush's heart didn't seem to be in the children's summit.
   He marched in the opening procession with one of his ``points of
light,'' 13-year-old Justin Lebo of Saddlebrook, N.J., who fixes up
broken bikes for needy kids, and he sat through a half-hour of
speeches by Mulroney and others before barreling through his own
plodding text.
   By then the engines were already idling on presidential
helicopters and jets waiting to whisk the president back to
Washington to ink the deficit deal. The White House tipped
reporters off that in the interest of saving time, Bush would not
read every word.
   Among the passages that didn't make the final cut: two
references to Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic fable of the
wisdom and innocence of youth, ``The Little Prince,'' including an
admonition against monarchs who issue ``one pronouncement after
another ... all to no effect whatsoever.''
   But the president did find time to remind the international
dignitaries that, ``Programs can best enhance the welfare of
children by strengthening the mutual responsibilities of public
institutions and individual families.''
   
   ---
   
   ``Look at that! Hey! How beautiful!'' exclaimed Bush when
Nicaraguan President Violeta de Chamorro presented him with an
AK-47 rifle, cut in half with a blow torch and mounted on a frame.
   Mrs. Chamorro explained that the Soviet-made rifle had been
confiscated from a civilian and was a symbol of her efforts to help
democracy take root in post-Sandinista Nicaragua.
   But despite Bush's effusive remarks, she wasn't convinced the
unusual souvenir was a hit.
   ``I don't know if you really do like the gift,'' she said. ``I
don't have a silver tray.''
   ``I do, I do like the gift,'' insisted her host. ``I like this
better because it does have a message.'' Aides said later he has a
spot in mind for it in a trophy room at Camp David.
   
   ---
   
   When Colombian President Cesar Gaviria descended on a cramped
press room after his tete-a-tete with Bush, the ever-efficient
White House Communications Agency had a microphone stand ready and
a ``mult-box'' that provides reporters with broadcast-quality
audio.
   Nevertheless, many of the Colombian press corps eschewed the
mult-box and crowded around the voluble Gaviria, holding up
microphones and tape recorders. One radio man held up a phone,
getting a beat on his rivals with a direct line back to Bogota.
   One television reporter apparently had her audio lines plugged
into the mult-box. But after eyeing the spectacle of her colleagues
crowded around Gaviria with their company microphones under the
president's chin, she took her own dummy mike - replete with a
large network logo - and thrust it up into the thicket. She kept it
there for 10 minutes, taping nothing, but showing the company flag.

   The quest by Nancy Cruzan's family
for legal permission to let their comatose daughter die could get a
boost from new evidence and the state's desire to get out of the
case.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who won a U.S.
Supreme Court decision in June preventing removal of the
33-year-old woman's feeding tube, said in mid-September that the
state has ``no recognizable legal interest'' in the case.
   ``We were in it initially to represent the state hospital
because there was no law. Now there is case law as stated by the
Missouri Supreme Court and upheld by the Supreme Court,'' he said.
   Webster also said Missouri's health director recently signed an
affidavit saying if the court orders the feeding tube removed, the
state will carry out the directive.
   And Joe and Joyce Cruzan said last week that three people are
willing to testify about discussions with their daughter concerning
life-sustaining treatment before the 1983 car crash that left her
in a coma-like condition.
   They have asked Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel to hear
the new evidence. A hearing is expected to be held in November.
   ``It removes the principal opposition. Now that they (the state)
want out, that means there are only two parties left in, the family
and myself. It would help them out,'' Thad McCanse, Ms. Cruzan's
court-appointed attorney.
   McCanse won't say what position he will take on the new
evidence, but he had previously urged the courts to side with the
family.
   Even so, Joe Cruzan refuses to be optimistic after many
disappointments, including the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling against
his family in its first ``right-to-die'' decision, in which it
ruled 5-4 that the state could keep a patient on life support in
the absence of ``clear and convincing'' proof that the person would
want to die.
   ``We're just going to wait and see what happens,'' Cruzan said
from his home at Carterville. ``We'll continue trying to do what we
think is the right thing for us and Nancy.''
   The Cruzans visit their daughter weekly at the state-run
Missouri Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon. Her body is rigid,
her hands and feet bent into claws. She breathes on her own, and at
times her eyes are open and move randomly.
   The legal fight began when the parents, after realizing their
daughter would never recover, asked doctors to remove the feeding
tube. The doctors refused and in 1987, the family went to Teel.
   Teel ruled for the family in 1988. The Missouri Supreme Court
overturned that decision five months later. The family appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Ms. Cruzan left no written instructions about what she would
want done under such circumstances. The family, however, had
testified they were certain about their request, based on a
lifetime of experiences and conversations the young woman had with
a friend.
   The Cruzans said three people they won't identify have now come
forward to say that their daughter had expressed a wish not to be
kept alive in such fashion.
   Bill Colby, an attorney for Ms. Cruzan and her family, said the
new evidence meets the ``clear and convincing'' standard.
   The attorney general, meanwhile, said he has asked Teel to hold
a hearing on removing the state Health Department from the
litigation. The department runs the rehabilitation center. No
hearing date has been set.

<HEAD>Tough Times for Iraq's Ambassador to Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat is a
man under siege.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III refuses to see him. He
usually is summoned, not invited, to the State Department.
   Calls from Capitol Hill are few and far between, and U.S.
businessmen shun his complex.
   After the United States and Iraq engaged in tit-for-tat
expulsions of diplomats - forcing the Iraqi Embassy to close its
trade, military and press sections - Mashat found his embassy staff
of 55 reduced to 16.
   ``This is the most difficult period in our lives, the last two
months,'' Mashat, 59, said in an interview in his huge,
wood-paneled office.
   The walls are decorated with two pictures of his boss, Saddam
Hussein, and a television set is tuned to Cable News Network. A
shortwave radio sits by his desk.
   The atmosphere at the short-staffed embassy is subdued; a
secretary answers two telephones; reporters drop by asking for
visas to travel to Baghdad; and Iraqi officials chat in Arabic on
couches in the foyer.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Mashat has steadfastly
defended his country's action in the face of near-unanimous
international criticism of the occupation. He generally repeats the
line espoused in Baghdad.
   In response to Iraq's actions, Mashat has been dressed down
privately by Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly, challenged by
television interviewers from Ted Koppel to Barbaa Walters and, in
essence, been called a liar by returning Americans who had been
held hostage in Iraq.
   When Mashat showed up at Washington Dulles International airport
to greet a group of returning Americans citizens, he called them
``guests'' of his country who had been treated well.
   ``I wasn't a guest,'' retorted 76-year-old Lloyd Culberton of El
Paso, Texas. ``I damned near starved to death.''
   ``He is faced with some difficult problems,'' said Marshall
Wiley, a former ambassador to Iraq who knows Mashat. ``Even the
most skilled diplomat would have a tough time.''
   ``He's a likeable enough fellow, but he is not negotiating or
trying to improve his country's situation through his
personality,'' said a State Department official, speaking on
condition he remain anonymous.
   Diplomats familiar with Mashat said he does not have the
charisma of his predecessor, Nizar Hamdoon, who is now Iraq's
deputy foreign minister.
   Mashat has made frequent appearances on television and he does
not shy away from the social scene despite the official strains
between his country and other nations of the world.
   He attended, for instance, an annual black-tie ball for
diplomats last week, sitting at a table near that of Gen. Colin
Powell, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   An American-educated diplomat who served as his country's
ambassador in London, Paris and Vienna before he came to the United
States a year ago, Mashat is bitter about the U.S. response to the
invasion of Kuwait.
   The gulf crisis is an ``Arab problem and solutions should come
from the Arabs,'' he said, adding that he views the United
Nations-imposed sanctions on Iraq as ``outrageous.''
   Moreover, Mashat said Iraq's actions are no worse than the U.S.
military intervention in Panama and Grenada or the mining of
Nicaraguan harbors in the 1980s.
   The Americans held against their will in Iraq will be released
as soon as the United States gives written assurances that Iraq
will not be attacked, Mashat said.
   Echoing Saddam's statements, Mashat also said Iraq ``will never
fire the first shot,'' but that any provocation by the United
States to start a war would lead to a prolonged conflict. The
aftereffects of such a conflict would sour U.S.-Arab relations for
decades, he said.
   Despite official tensions, Mashat, who was educated at the
University of California and University of Maryland, still thinks
Americans like Iraqis personally.
   As for his future, Mashat has no plans to leave anytime soon. He
and his wife and three children intend to remain in the nation's
capital until Saddam recalls him.

<DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Alex Olejko can look out his office
window at sea gulls gliding over piles of iron ore, a reminder of
this Lake Erie port's industrial past.
   He also can see the remains of the once bustling American
Shipbuilding Co. yard that shut down in 1983.
   But he has a vision of the mostly barren 54-acre site
transformed into a $300 million casino resort that would spur
development along the Black River and bring jobs to this
blue-collar city.
   He hopes to take the first step toward that dream Nov. 6, when
Ohio voters decide whether to let Lorain hold an election on
allowing a casino.
   If the state's voters give their OK, and Lorain voters follow
with their own approval, the city will become Ohio's first site for
an experimental casino. If the venture was deemed successful after
three years, the state could eventually have seven other
casino-resort districts.
   The proposed constitutional amendment was put on the ballot by a
petition drive after the state Senate rejected the idea. It has
drawn opposition from religious leaders as well as Gov. Richard
Celeste and the mayors of Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus.
   Olejko and other supporters of the plan are trying to focus the
debate on giving Lorain residents the right to decide for
themselves.
   ``If they don't want to gamble that's fine. I don't like to
gamble either. But don't deny me my choice. Just like if I want to
have a beer, that's my choice. That's what America is all about -
freedom of choice,'' the mayor said.
   Gambling opponents say the ``right to vote'' argument is a ploy
to have the casino issue decided only in Lorain, where it is most
likely to pass.
   ``Their Let Us Vote campaign ... uses a slick public relations
theme to somehow portray that if anyone is against Issue 3 they are
somehow un-American or unpatriotic,'' said the Rev. John Adams of
Lorain, who heads a coalition opposing the casino plan.
   Colorado and North Dakota are among several other states that
have ballot measures on gambling this year.
   Colorado voters will decide whether to permit small-stakes
gambling in three old-time mining towns, Cripple Creek, Central
City and Black Hawk. In North Dakota, voters are considering
whether to allow gambling in Roland Township, which includes the
Lake Metigoshe resort area.
   Voters in North Dakota also will decide whether to permit video
gambling machines in bars. A similar issue is on the ballot in
Nebraska.
   Riverboat gambling has been approved in Illinois and Iowa, but
the Illinois law doesn't take effect until January and the Iowa
statute not until April.
   Voters in Gary, Ind., last year endorsed gambling in
hotel-casino resorts, but a bill to allow it died in the
Legislature in March.
   Elsewhere:
   - Voters in Louisiana will decide in Saturday's election whether
to have a lottery.
   - Supporters of an Arkansas lottery gathered enough signatures
to put the issue on the Nov. 6 ballot, but opponents have gone to
court to try to get the question removed.
   - New Jersey residents will vote on permitting Sunday horse
racing.
   - Voters in Trousdale County, Tenn., will decide whether to
become the second locality in that state to legalize horse racing.
Memphis voters previously approved it, but no license has been
issued for a track.
   In Lorain, Olejko, a former steelworker, said the casino-hotel
would be a great tourist destination and would create 3,000 to
7,000 jobs.
   Lorain's steel and auto industries are prone to severe setbacks
when the nation's economy slumps, and the mayor said employment has
been declining over the years at Lorain's Ford assembly plant and
the former USX Lorain Works, now the USS-Kobe (Japan) joint
venture.
   The city's population, estimated at 80,000 in 1980, has fallen
to about 75,000.
   Adams, pastor of Lake Breeze Revival Center, a
non-denominational church, said his opposition is not based on
religious or moral values.
   ``Casinos don't deliver what they promise, plain and simple,''
he said. ``There is a certain element of wanting something for
nothing that comes along with pulling the handle of a slot machine
or making a bet. People may think they will get a lot more out of
it than they actually do get.''

   ``If you smoke, drive or drink,'' the proposed
budget agreement will hit you where it hurts, one congressional
leader says. But even if you don't do any of those things, you'll
still feel the pain.
   Elderly or disabled Medicare recipients will pay higher
premiums.
   Students will see their federal loan program reduced.
   Farmers would lose $13 billion in agricultural subsidies.
   Among the other intended effects: Higher taxes for families
moving up from Toyota to Mercedes; less opportunity for low income
families who depend on subsidized housing - and for high income
taxpayers whose accountants look for every possible deduction.
Jobless Americans would wait longer to receive their initial
unemployment benefits.
   The Bush administration believes the $500 billion in tough tax
and spending measures prescribed in Sunday's agreement with
congressional leaders is necessary as a means of denting the
federal deficit.
   ``In terms of pocketbook impact, nothing can be more important
to every American, men and women who are either alone or who have
families they have to care for, than the overall economic
climate,'' said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   The budget negotiators - Sununu included - believe that after
the yelps of protest die down, their budget agreement will pass
Congress and have a positive effect: Helping the average American
by spurring the economy enough to let interest rates drop and
businesses prosper.
   Whether the package - even if enacted in full - will ever have
that effect is uncertain. There are too many question marks,
ranging from the whims of foreign investors to the price other
countries demand for oil, to predict how the U.S. economy will
behave.
   But while the country's economic doctors wait for the
prescription to take effect, Americans of all classes are being
asked to bear a part of the pain.
   Some of the major elements of the five-year budget plan were
best summed up by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who
said, ``If you smoke, drive or drink, you're going to pay a little
more.''
   Cigarette taxes will gradually grow from the current 16 cents
per pack to 24 cents.
   The tax on a six-pack of beer will go from 16 cents to 36 cents.
A gallon of hard liquor will be taxed $13.70, up $1.20 from today.
The levy on table wine will grow from 3 cents to 24 cents per
bottle.
   Gasoline, now taxed by the federal government at 9 cents per
gallon, will eventually carry a 21-cent-per-gallon levy.
   If you fly, the federal tax you pay on your airline tickets will
grow from 8 percent to 10 percent.
   Fancy cars, private boats, furs and jewelry will be taxed
another 10 percent above price thresholds for each item. Boat
owners also will be assessed a $25 annual fee to help cover the
Coast Guard's costs of patrolling the waterways.
   People who earn more than $100,000 annually will lose 3 percent
of their deductions above that amount.
   Upper-middle-class wage earners will notice higher taxes taken
out of their paychecks too. The 1.45 percent tax that helps support
the Medicare program, which is now applied to only the first
$51,300 of income, will now be subtracted for the first $73,000.
   Medicare recipients - the nation's elderly and disabled - will
be paying more and getting less. Their $28.60 monthly premium for
doctors' care will cost about $34.30. And they will have to pay the
first $150 of doctors' bills themselves, double the current
deductible.
   Farmers will see the programs that support them cut by $13
billion over the five years. Federal retirees, now allowed to take
in a lump sum a portion of their pension funds, will lose that
option.
   The government will get tougher on students who default on
guaranteed student loans. Veterans programs will be reduced as
well.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from a translation of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's address to Moslems on Sunday,
carried on Iraqi state television and radio, on the occasion of the
birthday of the Prophet Mohammed:
   ---
   We have said on more than one occasion that the infidels have
not carried out aggression against the people of faith in Iraq
because of the events that took place after Aug. 2. Their
aggressive actions took place long before Aug. 2. Even the American
decision to impose a bread embargo on Iraq began before Aug. 2.
Besides, even before Aug. 2, there was talk in America and Europe
of exploring ways of boycotting Iraq.
   This provides enough, documented evidence that they harbored
aggressive intentions using the pretext of what they called Iraq's
dangerous, and growing military might, its developing industry and
the military industrialization of our country and our remark on
April 4 in response to aggressive postures and statements that
whoever strikes at Iraq or any other Arabs we will hit back
strongly. These statements were cover by the West for aggression in
the form of political, informational, and economic actions.
   After the criminals realized that all these aggressive actions
had not prevented Iraq from its program to call for and demand the
liberation of Palestine, narrow the gap between the poor and the
rich, and use oil within a humanitarian and rational policy, they
pushed the Croesus of Kuwait and his supporters the backward sheiks
in Kuwait and other places to play their shameless treacherous role
in plotting against Iraq, and to weaken it with the aim of
achieving their disappointed aspirations.
   Instead of relinquishing our principles, the honor involved in
the right and responsible position, and the great Iraqi people's
role, the blow was directed at the Croesus of Kuwait and his
supporters, and by this defensive and revolutionary measure, which
achieved an unprecedented success with the help of God, the usurped
right of faithful Iraq was restored, a right on which the throne of
corruption had been established until Kuwait had been deprived of
any light during the past period.
   The infidel people and the enemies of the Arab nation who
betrayed the Arab nation went out of their mind and realized that
the punishment inflicted on those who appeared on the stage of
hostility to the line of faith and struggle to liberate Palestine
would increase the ability of faith and the faithful and help
spread right and diminish the influence of falsehood. Therefore,
armies and fleets came from every evil corner led by the haven of
evil in the United States. Instead of learning the lesson of Aug. 2
to stay away from plans and measures preceding the event, they
began, as usual with those who fall into the abyss and whose
behavior is dominated by satan and grudge, to increase their forces
and commit another crime against God, his messenger, and the
faithful by occupying the land of the Arab and Moslem sanctities in
the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Gulf.
   The Iraqi armed forces will be prepared to stay alert, ready to
face any eventuality and prepared to defend the province of Kuwait
the same way it would defend any other province in the country.
   The Arab solution can only be achieved in an atmosphere of good
Arab relations. Since good Arab relations cannot be conceived in
the presence of foreign forces on Arab lands and Moslem holy places
and under threats, these forces must go.
   Should the international community be involved in a solution to
the crisis, then the emphasis should be on the initiative of Aug.
12, 1990, which underlined that . . . peace could not be achieved
without the settlement of all problems of the region...
   Withdrawal of foreign forces from the lands of Najd and Hejaz
(Saudi Arabia) and the Arabian Gulf, and ending the blockade of
Iraq, is a slogan for all Arabs and believers to raise.
   In all cases, we must encourage every foreign move, including
those made by those who were involved in amassing the fleets, to
retreat without bargaining over our objectives and principles. We
should also regard any retreat that is based on the fact that the
picture was not clear at the beginning as a virtue for those who
make this retreat. Therefore, we view the speech of the French
president, despite certain reservations, as being of a different
language, and we hope our positive interpretation is correct.
   Difference in opinion does not annoy us. What annoys us is the
grudge-filled baseless accusations by certain leaders unwilling to
discuss our perceptions and interpretations.
   It is not important to agree or disagree with this initiative or
that, including that of French President Mitterrand. What is
important is that a serious dialogue be launched in search of a
possible, just and comprehensive solution that would allow peace to
prevail and lay solid foundations for the future of the concerned
people of the region that are not shaken by circumstantial changes.
   We intend to launch contact with the French government with the
aim of formulating a precise viewpoint . . . so that action could
be launched on clear and solid foundations.
   Our main concern is that the situation that prevailed before
Aug. 2 on all levels may not be repeated; that Palestine returns to
its people, the Palestinians, so they can set up their independent
state and the foreign occupation forces depart from the land of
Najd, Hejaz (Saudi Arabia) and the gulf without any conditions.''

<HEAD>Kerry Faces Fight for Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John Kerry's re-election bid has suddenly
turned into a dogfight with Republican challenger James Rappaport,
who is trying to capitalize on a wave of voter anger with
established Democrats.
   Only a few days after winning the GOP nomination last month,
Rappaport fired off a ``He's baaaaack'' television advertisement,
painting Kerry as a clone of Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``Jim Rappaport obviously wants to use Mike Dukakis to hide the
fact that he doesn't have a record and that he's unwilling to run
against me on my record,'' responds Kerry.
   Until recently, many political observers did not give Rappaport,
a 34-year-old real estate developer, much of a chance of unseating
Kerry, who is completing his first term.
   But that changed after the Sept. 18 primary. Voters ousted many
high-profile politicians, showing frustration with a
Democrat-controlled state government that has been mired in fiscal
hardship since Dukaki lost the 1988 presidential race.
   Rappaport, seeking public office for the first time, has seized
on this anti-incumbency mood. And after spending $1.7 million of
his own money on the primary, he has shown the financial ability to
wage an all-out battle.
   The combination of these factors has turned the race into a
virtual dead heat in recent public opinion polls.
   ``This one wasn't on the radar screen a few weeks ago,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of the Political Report, a Washington,
D.C., newsletter that monitors congressional elections.
   The race has gained more prominence in the eyes of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, which now considers Massachusetts
one of its top prospects for defeating a Democratic incumbent, said
Wendy Burnley, spokeswoman for the committee.
   Republicans for months have believed the political climate in
Massachusetts made Kerry vulnerable, but officials took a
``wait-and-see attitude'' until after the primary, Burnley said.
   ``Once the primary was over, once the voters in the strongest
terms possible made their views known, certainly Massachusetts
became a top race,'' Burnley said.
   That will mean more money for Rappaport. The senatorial
committee intends to spend the maximum amount of money allowable on
Rappaport's behalf, which will total about $460,000, Burnley said.
In addition, the committee will contribute $17,500 directly to his
campaign, also the maximum amount.
   One of Rappaport's main tactics has been to link Kerry with
Dukakis, calling him a ``philosophical twin'' of the unpopular
governor. A recent campaign ad showed Dukakis' face slowly
transforming into a picture of Kerry.
   Kerry, 46, who served as lieutenant governor under Dukakis for
two years before winning the Senate seat, has tried to fend off
these attacks. He said that when he left for Washington, the state
government was in sound shape. Also, Kerry noted that he was an
early supporter of the Gramm-Rudman act to control the federal
deficit.
   But Rappaport says Kerry's responsibility toward the state did
not disappear when he entered the Senate.
   ``As a leader, what he should have done'' was challenge ``the
leadership in this state to get spending under control,'' Rappaport
said.
   Former Democratic Sen. Paul Tsongas, who gave up the seat Kerry
won, said he thinks the attempts to link Kerry and Dukakis are
``too cute.''
   ``We're talking about the U.S. Senate, not a race for the
Legislature,'' he said.
   Some political analysts suggest Rappaport must continue to
define the race as a referendum on Kerry and the Democrats, rather
than a head-to-head matchup.
   Chris Greeley, political director for Kerry, said the campaign
will try to point out inconsistencies in Rappaport's background,
such as his opposition to farm subsidies even though his family's
dairy farm in Vermont received such assistance.
   Rappaport says he would give up that money if Kerry would stop
accepting ``subsidies'' through franking privileges that allow him
to send mail to voters.
   But Kerry is hitting back with his own ads.
   ``If you live by the sword, you die by the sword,'' the senator
said recently.
   One of his recent radio commercials says Rappaport knows Vermont
and Hawaii, where he has had other business interests, ``but Jim
Rappaport doesn't know diddly about Massachusetts.''
   ``I think Massachusetts voters are rational voters,'' Greeley
said. ``Yes they are angry. But that is not to suggest the anger
will make it possible for any candidate for any office to receive
their support.''

<HEAD>Celtic Dee Brown May Give Up on Wellesley After Police Shakeup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston Celtics rookie Dee Brown, forced
from a car by police and ordered to lie on the ground at gunpoint
in a case of mistaken identity, is thinking twice about moving to
this wealthy, mostly white suburb.
   The basketball team's top draft choice is black, 21 and fresh
out of Jacksonville State in Florida, where he heard of Boston's
reputation for racism.
   ``When you think of towns up North and you think of racism, you
think of Boston,'' Brown said.
   Wellesley police converged on Brown and his fiancee, who is
white, as they sat in a parked car Sept. 21 across from a bank that
had been robbed of about $1,700 a few days before.
   Police arrived after a bank employee saw Brown and reported he
could be the robber. Brown, who is 6-1, said he was forced from the
car by at least five officers, told to lie face down on the
pavement and had guns pointed at his head before his identity was
confirmed and the two were freed.
   ``It's always going to be in the back of my head,'' he said.
   Brown had his eyes on a 100-year-old Victorian house in this
Boston suburb of about 26,000. But he said he may not complete the
deal, despite apologies from Police Chief John Fritts and some
residents.
   ``Black, white, no one should be subject to that kind of
harassment,'' Brown said. ``I have to dig deep and look at if I
love this town or not.''
   The incident has raised anew questions about racism in the
Boston area, a year after black neighborhoods were descended upon
by police searching for the killer of pregnant Carol Stuart in what
later turned out to be a hoax concocted by her husband, Charles.
Charles Stuart apparently jumped to his death in the Boston Harbor
after his story began to unravel.
   ``I think (police harassment) is something that happens often. I
think it got the press that it did because Brown is a Boston Celtic
player,'' said Louis Elisa, director of the Boston chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   A black former Celtic, Bill Russell, took a direct approach to a
similar problem in the 1950s.
   Russell, who was named the NBA's greatest player ever and played
for the Celtics for 13 years beginning in 1956, said in his
autobiography that he was harassed several times by police. He
chose to make his family the only black household in Reading, a
suburb north of Boston.
   Barbara Shanahan, chairman of the Wellesley Board of Selectmen,
said Brown's treatment by police is under investigation. If the
board determines police are not sensitive to blacks, programs on
ethnic and cultural understanding will be started, she said.
   Brown hopes his Wellesley experience will ``open the eyes of
people in Boston that racial tension is here.''
   ``You try to make Boston, Wellesley, anywhere you want to live,
a better place,'' he said.
   Shanahan said she hopes Brown makes his home in Wellesley.
   ``I guess I'm hoping that it (would be) a recognition on his
part that this is a community that will welcome him and will be a
good community for him to live in,'' she said.

final years in the United States died in an escalator accident on
arrival at Miami International Airport, authorities say.
   At least five people were injured Sunday when Bertola Agrispina
Acosta-Bereda, 75, fell on the escalator and started a chain
reaction, pulling other passengers on top of her, police and
witnesses said.
   ``She cried out, she screamed. And then she fainted or had some
type of attack,'' said Nancy Brizuela, an airport official who
translated the comments of witnesses.
   ``Then the others who were right behind her just went over her
and they were unable to stop and they trampled her.''
   Police said the woman, one of a group of elderly Cuban
immigrants who had just arrived from Havana on a weekly Eastern
Airlines charter, may have been frightened by the movement of the
escalator.
   ``It's possible they've never seen an escalator before,'' said
Metro-Dade Detective Ralph Fernandez.''
   Dade County medical examiner Arthur Copeland said it wasn't
immediately clear why the woman fell.
   ``She herself might have had something like a heart attack. I
won't know till the autopsy ... what caused her to fall back. She
had extensive injuries on her face and she may have had a broken
leg too,'' he said.
   At least five people, including the dead woman's husband, were
taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. They were listed in stable
condition after being treated for minor injuries.
   Fernandez said Mrs. Acosta-Bereda and her husband, whom he
declined to identify, had decided to live in Miami.
   ``I believe they were planning to live here permanently,'' he
said.

   Fluttering flags and yellow ribbons marked
Robert Polhill's return home after 39 months as a hostage in the
Middle East and five months fighting throat cancer.
   Looking gaunt but happy, Polhill waved to well-wishers Sunday
during a parade.
   ``The warmth of your welcome overwhelms me,'' Polhill, who was
unable to speak, said in a statement read by his wife, Ferial. ``I
regret that I am not sufficiently fluent to greet you myself.''
   Telephone poles and signposts were festooned with ribbons along
the eight-mile parade route from Fishkill, about 50 miles north of
New York City, to Beacon. People held balloons, waved American
flags and wore yellow ribbons.
   ``I'm overwhelmed with all these people,'' said Polhill's
mother, Ruth, who lives in Fishkill. ``It was a remarkable
greeting.''
   Polhill, 56, was an accountant and assistant business professor
at Beirut University in Lebanon when he and three other faculty
members were captured by Moslem extremists on Jan. 24, 1987.
   He was released April 22 but was hospitalized for diabetes and
malnutrition. At Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, a
growth removed from his vocal cords was found to be cancerous.
Polhill's voice box was removed during the operation.
   The original homecoming plan this spring was scuttled while
Polhill receivedtreatment at Walter Reed, living in housing on the
hospital grounds.
   Folk singer Pete Seeger dedicated ``God Bless America'' to
Polhill on Sunday. Police flanked the route, and fire trucks and a
small band joined the procession, which was held in conjunction
with Spirit of Beacon Day.
   ``It makes me happy to see that Robert was not forgotten,'' said
Ferial Polhill. ``Forgetfulness would have been easy and
understandable.''
   Asked if he felt like a hero, Polhill shook his head.
   ``I don't care what he thinks. In my eyes he's a hero,'' his
wife said.

   The leader of Angola's U.S.-backed rebels says
he believes peace negotiations with the country's leftist
government are so far advanced that a cease-fire is likely within
the next three months.
   ``We feel the climate is favorable by the end of the year,''
Jonas Savimbi, head of the UNITA rebels, said in an interview. He
based his optimism on the last round of negotiations with
government representatives, which ended Thursday in Portugal.
   Savimbi outlined his thoughts to two American reporters on
Sunday at the start of a week-long round of official talks and
media appearances. He meets with President Bush on Tuesday.
   The veteran guerrilla leader seemed more upbeat about peace
prospects than at any time since he took up arms against Portuguese
colonial rule 25 years ago. He and his followers have been waging a
bloody civil war against the Soviet-backed government for 15 years.
   Savimbi said it should be possible for free elections to be held
in Angola by the end of 1991 if all goes according to plan. But he
said the process could be upset if Congress denies his forces
additional aid.
   ``If aid to UNITA is put in doubt, then this is going to hamper
tremendously the negotiating process,'' he said. The U.S.
assistance, provided covertly, is believed to average about $60
million annually.
   Savimbi said his purpose here is not to discuss aid, but that
issue is certain to arise in his talks on Capitol Hill.
   Angolan government officials have said that previous
justifications for continued U.S. aid to UNITA have disappeared.
   Among other actions, these officials noted that Cuban troops
have been leaving the country at a rate of about 1,500 a month and
Angola has agreed to a multi-party democracy and to a free market
economy.
   There also have been repeated allegations that Savimbi runs
UNITA with an iron fist, dealing ruthlessly with potential rivals.
UNITA has denied the allegations.
   The government has also charged that UNITA attacks in the
countryside have displaced more than 1 million people.
   Paulo Tuba, a member of an opposition party who nonetheless
supports the government's negotiating position, said last week that
U.S. aid to UNITA should be suspended.
   ``Continued aid to UNITA is not conducive to a peace
settlement,'' he said.
   Savimbi cited as evidence of progress the presence for the first
time of American and Soviet representatives at the last round of
peace talks. The two superpowers have been at odds over Angola for
many years, sending arms to rival sides.
   Another plus, Savimbi said, was that there were more extensive
discussions than ever before on ground rules for a cease-fire.
   He acknowledged that the Angolan government has been more
flexible than before because circumstances ``forced a change.''
   Angolan authorities, he said, realize that a doctrinaire Marxist
approach is no longer sustainable at a time when pro-Soviet regimes
elsewhere are collapsing under popular pressure.
   Savimbi said once the Angolan government extends to UNITA
political recognition and a cease-fire is reached, the rebel forces
can relocate to internationally monitored enclaves during the
process leading up to the election of a national government.
   ``There is no military solution,'' he said. ``Only a political
solution.''

<HEAD>Study: U.S. Has Too Many Mammography Machines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mammograms would be cheaper and perhaps more
effective in preventing breast cancer deaths if the United States
did not have as many mammography machines, researchers reported
today.
   The researchers from the National Institutes of Health and the
Food and Drug Administration reported in the Annals of Internal
Medicine that the country has 3{ times more mammography machines
than it needs.
   Martin L. Brown of the National Cancer Institute, the report's
lead author, said the high number of the X-ray screening devices
reduces the number of patients per machine, keeping costs high.
   And with so many facilities using the machnnes, it's unlikely
they can afford the record-keeping and follow-up care that make
mammography useful in preventing deaths from breast cancer, he
said.
   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Alvin Mushlin of the University
of Rochester Medical Center also warned that the oversupply of
``mammography units may ultimately lead to a situation in which
more care does not mean better care, and it certainly is unlikely
to mean more cost-effective care.''
   Researchers estimate that each year, 150,000 American women
develop breast cancer and 44,000 die of the disease.
   Breast cancer rates could be lowered about 30 percent if women
received mammograms as recommended by the National Cancer
Institute, according to earlier studies. About one-third of women
eligible get regular screenings, the Centers for Disease Control
reported.
   Although an estimated 10,000 mammography machines were installed
by 1990, the actual need is only about 2,600, the authors said.
   If doctors lowered the average cost of a screening test from
$100 to $50 by using fewer machines, the country could save $763
million a year in health costs, Brown said.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long, gray row of rundown tenements on
East Berlin's Mainzer Street drips with Communist flags and defiant
banners, a splash of color dedicated to the demise of Germany.
   Radical leftists have taken over 12 of the 20 abandoned
apartment houses on the street, part of a bleak working-class
district just east of the city center.
   For many of the hundreds of people in this squatters' commune,
the unification of Germany on Wednesday is a call to battle.
   ``It depends on the police, it depends on the fascists, it
depends on what happens that day,'' said a West Berliner who only
identified himself as Tommy. He was designated as spokesman when a
reporter visited on Sunday.
   ``I'm quite scared that Germany coming together is already
turning Germany against foreigners, against leftist people,'' he
said. ``You won't find anyone on this street saying, `yeah, a big
strong Germany.'''
   Radicals and police alike say violent clashes have become a grim
probability on the night before and the day of German unity.
   Police have beefed up their presence noticeably, especially at
historical sites designated for unity day celebrations.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel, a
law-and-order advocate, declared Sunday that police should act
``with decisiveness'' against ``radical occurrences.''
   West Berlin Interior Minister Erich Paetzold warned of ``an
alarming security situation in East Berlin'' in a message to that
city's police.
   But he urged East Germany's police to use restraint and to avoid
letting confrontations escalate.
   Diestel said safeguarding the official unification events ``is a
matter of extreme urgency.''
   East Berlin has become a cauldron of extremist violence by
neo-Nazi skinheads, self-described hooligans and left-wing
radicals.
   The groups frequently stage attacks on each other.
   Not far from Mainzer Street, neo-Nazi skinheads have taken over
a large apartment house.
   The city government has said it is up to the federal police to
remove them, while the federal government says it has no evidence
to link such groups to attacks.
   Much of the burgeoning leftist scene in East Berlin has been
nurtured by the veteran radicals in West Berlin, who stage
firebomb-and rock-throwing riots every May 1, the international
labor day.
   Much of the right-wing violence is prompted by a resentment of
foreigners and is aimed at the large Turkish, Vietnamese and
Mozambican populations in Berlin.
   East Berlin's vast main square, Alexanderplatz, has become a
focal point for such clashes. On any given night, groups of young
Turks warily share territory with rightist skinheads and apolitical
young people who label themselves ``hooligans.''
   On Friday night, hundreds of hooligans clashed with police on
Alexanderplatz and 15 were arrested.
   Three days earlier, 200 leftist radicals wearing ski masks
slowly marched down East Berlin's Leipziger Street, stopped at a
grocery story that has been trying desperately to compete with a
new West German chain outlet nearby, and destroyed its glass facade
with iron bars and rocks.
   They walked slowly away while stunned pedestrians watched
remaining shards of glass crash sporadically to the ground. No
explanation was offered for their choice of target.
   The leftists say they are united in opposition to what they say
will be a right-wing Germany that is a threat to peace and to
people from Third World countries.
   In leaflets and conversations, they have dubbed unity day
``Action Day,'' and have scheduled protests to counter the official
celebrations.
   They have scheduled a main demonstration against racism and
``German megalomania'' for Wednesday.
   ``Just don't bring a camera you like,'' grinned one of the
leftists on Mainzer Street.
   The man who identified himself said his group wants peace and is
trying to build relations with other people in the neighborhood,
but he would not rule out violence at the demonstrations scheduled
in the coming days.
   He said the group has been occupying the block on Mainzer since
April and is negotiating with the city to stay while it renovates
the buildings.
   He said half of the people living there are West Germans.
   East Berlin's government has been reluctant to evict squatters
because of the dire housing shortage.
   The whine of drills and circular sanders filled the air along
Mainzer Street on Sunday. Huge banners called for a dissolution of
Germany and installation of a state based on anarchy.
   East German Communist flags fluttered from window ledges and
hundreds of slogans were painted across each facade.

   NEW YORK (AP) - World chess champion Gary Kasparov says he will
spurn the Soviet flag because it represents ``oppression and
tyranny'' and defend his title next week under the red, white and
blue of the Russian republic.
   ``I am terribly pained and distracted by the chaos and misery of
my homeland - the result of 73 years of Communist dictatorship,''
Kasparov, 27, said Sunday.
   He said he was bothered by ``playing chess for three months,
living in luxury, while my fellow citizens must struggle each day
to find food.''
   Kasparov told The New York Times that the Russian flag ``has
become a symbol of protest and hope for the future.''
   Kasparov's title match against longtime rival Anatoly Karpov
begins on Monday.
   Kasparov said because he and Karpov are represented by the
Soviet Chess Federation, the Soviet flag is supposed to be at the
players' sides.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Kurt Vonnegut describes in his latest book the
anguish of an American who finds his country being sold piecemeal
to foreigners.
   Vonnegut's 13th novel, ``Hocus Pocus,'' is about a West Point
graduate and Vietnam veteran who writes his autobiography in 2001
as he watches America overtaken by an ``occupation army'' of
Japanese businessmen.
   The novelist, a World War II veteran, said his countrymen should
beat the Japanese and the Germans in manufacturing and technology.
   ``I'm outraged that we don't do it better,'' Vonnegut, 68, said
in an interview in the October issue of Exposure magazine.
   He said he left his former publisher, Delacorte, after it was
sold to the German conglomerate Bertelsman, and joined Putnam
because he wanted his books to be printed by Americans.

   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, ST. Thomas (AP) - Cathedral bells tolled and
an overflow crowd welcomed Archbishop Desmond Tutu to the Virgin

sanctions against South Africa.
   ``Nelson Mandela is free today because of support of those
sanctions,'' Tutu told some 600 churchgoers at All Saints Cathedral
on Sunday.
   Tutu was invited to conduct confirmation services at the
Episcopal church.
   He thanked Virgin Islanders for ``supporting our struggle, for
praying for us, for being committed to the struggle for peace.''

   WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) - Loretta Lynn, once illiterate, has
recorded two songs to raise money for a literacy program she's
working on with Barbara Bush.
   ``It's going to be neat to have the first lady on the video with
me. I'd like to bring her to Kentucky and take her to some small
schools,'' the country singer said.
   The songs are titled ``I'm Changing'' and ``Count on Me.''
   ``When I was 17 years old, I would hold the Bible and cry
because I couldn't read it. Today, the Bible is the easiest thing
for me to read,'' she said after a concert in Wheeling on Friday.
   Lynn's life was the basis for the Oscar-winning film ``Coal

   RENO, Nev. (AP) - Heavy metal band Judas Priest, recently
cleared of liability in the suicide of two young fans, will donate
proceeds from a Nov. 3 concert to a charity for homeless youth, a

   The English group plans to donate part of ticket sales and
souvenirs to Community Runaway and Youth Services, said promoter
Michael Schivo.
   The amount of the donation has not been determined, he said.
   A state judge ruled Aug. 24 against two families who claimed
their teen-age sons fatally shot themselves after hearing

   NEW RICHMOND, Ind. (AP) - Director David Anspaugh and other
members of the cast and crew of ``Hoosiers'' returned for a
five-year reunion in the town where the Academy Award-winning
basketball movie was filmed.
   Anspaugh, a native of Decatur, and producer and scriptwriter
Angelo Pizzo were joined Sunday by most of the movie's basketball
team, the film's cheerleaders and dozens of extras.
   Anspaugh said he's amazed by the number of people who tell him
how much the film has affected them.
   ``You don't plan those things. You can't. They just happen,'' he
said.
   This town of 380 was transformed into fictional Hickory, Ind.,
for the story of a small-town high school's struggle to win the
state championship. It was inspired by the real-life town of
Milan's victory in 1954.

   Selling by individual investors trying to cover
margin requirements drove down share prices Monday on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, briefly driving them under 20,000 points for the
first time in more than three years.
   Meanwhile, the dollar fell moderately against the Japanese yen
during Monday trading.
   The closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues briefly
fell below 20,000 points shortly after the afternoon session began.
   But a last-minute buying spree, stimulated by rumors that the
Ministry of Finance would announce new market support measures,
pushed the Nikkei up to 20,221.86, down 761.64 points, or 3.63
percent from its Friday finish.
   A total of 400 million shares changed hands during Monday
trading.
   The decline brought the Nikkei average to nearly half its value
at the end of last year, when it peaked at 38,915.87 points.
   The dollar closed at 137.15 yen, down 0.80 yen from its Friday
close. The U.S. currency fluctuated between 137.00 yen and 137.88
yen.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
government bonds rose to 81.39 points by 3 p.m. from 80.75 Friday.
Their yields were at 8.530 percent, down from 8.690.
   On the stock market, traders briefly bought the Nikkei average
to cover short, or oversold, positions, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a
trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   But internal technical factors accentuated the selling mood and
sent the market barometer tumbling over 700 points by the end of
the morning session, he said.
   Financial issues were sold Monday to make up for artificial
gains Friday from institutional buying aimed at mid-fiscal year
window dressing.
   High-tech issues, however, were sought by bargain hunters,
traders said.
   ``Investors are still trying to determine when share prices will
hit bottom,'' said a dealer with Nikko Securities Co. ``But they do
not seem to agree about where the bottom line is yet.''
   In exchange dealings, dealers said trading was mixed on news of
a budget settlement in the United States that might lead to lower
interest rates as well as rumors that Iraq might be willing to
negotiate a compromise in the Middle East.
   Toru Kanai, an exchange analyst also with New Japan Securities,
said those factors led to dollar selling that brought the U.S.
currency as low as 137.20 during early trading.
   But the instability of the Tokyo equities market limited the
yen's strength against the dollar, he said.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said today that
the establishment of diplomatic ties with Moscow signals an end to
Cold War on the bitterly divided Korean peninsula and could lead to
reunification in a decade.
   The Soviet ties with South Korea were announced Sunday, the same
day Moscow said it was upgrading relations with Israel to the
consular level.
   Consular relations are a level below full diplomatic relations.
   The announcement of formal Soviet-South Korean relations, made
b the countries' foreign ministers in New York, is considered a
major diplomatic blow to North Korea. There was no immediate
comment from its Communist government.
   Roh said the new ties between Moscow and Seoul will make it
``impossible for North Korea alone to resist the tidal wave of
change'' sweeping the world.
   North Korea had vigorously lobbied Moscow, long a major ally and
arms provider, against establishing relations with South Korea.
   But the Soviets are no longer able to afford extensive foreign
aid, and are eager for enhanced trade and economic ties with Seoul.
   The formal establishment of ties culminates a two-year effort by
Roh to develop trade and diplomatic ties with communist and
socialist allies of North Korea in hopes of easing tension on the
peninsula.
   Sunday's move is also expected to give South Korea more leverage
in its bid to join the United Nations as a full member separately
from North Korea.
   In his speech today, Roh said it was an opportunity for the
rigid and totalitarian North to open its doors.
   ``Clearly, the north has reached the dead-end of its
isolationist policy,'' Roh told 50,000 spectators at an Armed
Forces Day review of troops. ``Inter-Korean relations are thus
approaching a major turning point.''
   ``The Cold War structure on the Korean Peninsula has begun to
change,'' he said. ``It is becoming feasible to achieve peaceful
unification before the present century is out.''
   The Koreas were divided at the end of World War II and fought
the Korean war from 1950 to 1953. They are technically still at
war, but have in recent months been engaged in dialogue that has
for the first time included meetings at the prime ministerial
level.
   Last week, the north opened talks with Japan on improving
relations, a move widely seen as an effort to counter Seoul's ties
to the north's longtime allies.
   South Korea is expected to open trade offices with China by the
end of the year. It has established relations with every East
European nation except Albania.
   In announcing ties with the Soviets in New York, Foreign
Minister Choi Ho-joong said a Soviet trade and economic delegation
would visit Seoul next month to discuss broad economic cooperation.
   He said he hoped China will also soon establish full diplomatic
ties with South Korea.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said, ``We believe
that establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and
South Korea will aid the cause of stability in Asia and the Pacific
region.''
   In today's speech, Roh said, ``The fact that our relations with
Moscow are normalized ... is spurring change in the security
situation on the Korean peninsula also.''
   He cautioned, however, that South Korea's 600,000 troops must
remain vigilant.
   The Soviets and Israelis said in New York on Sunday that they
would be opening consulates in each other's countries - a major
step in restoring relations severed after the 1967 Middle East War.
Israel seized territory from Moscow's Arab allies during that
conflict.
   Shevardnadze and Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, told
reporters they intend to start meeting regularly and that the
foreign ministries of the Kremlin and the Jewish state will be in
regular contact.
   Shevardnadze said Israel would open a consulate-general - the
highest level consulate - in Moscow, and the Soviets would open a
consulate-general in Tel Aviv.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said in Jerusalem that direct airline flights between the
Soviet Union and Israel will begin within a month.
   Such flights could accelerate the exodus of Soviet Jews to
Israel, which is already straining to accommodate more than 100,000
Soviet emigres who arrived since last year.

   Six dozen kings, presidents and prime
ministers have concluded what was billed as history's largest
international summit with a pledge to create a healthier, safer and
more caring planet for children.
   The task is daunting.
   Organizers estimate that even during the two-day weekend summit,
54,000 children died from preventable illnesses and hunger.
   The gathering sought to mobilize governments to save up to 100
million children from death by disease and malnutrition in the
1990s.
   The leaders unanimously adopted a 1,700-word declaration to
combat poverty, disease, hunger, illiteracy, AIDS and drugs. They
also vowed to grant children first claim on earth's resources in
peace or war.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada - one of six leaders who
10 months ago proposed the summit - told Sunday's closing session
in the U.N. General Assembly chamber that the declaration and its
plan of action ``represent the promise of world leaders to
succeeding generations.
   ``A better world for children is within our reach but ... not
yet within our grasp ... success will depend on the deaths we
prevent, the number of lives we improve ... it is time to match our
words with action.''
   Officials at the summit estimated that achieving the
declaration's goals would cost billions of dollars - and there was
no specific pledge of funds.
   The accord gives no monetary figure and relies on the good will
of nations for contributions.
   Louis Sullivan, U.S. secretary of health and human services,
initialed the declaration for the United States, although Bush
administration officials last week voiced some reservations.
   Their reluctance about endorsing the declaration had stemmed
from its call for nations to ratify the 1989 U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child. The United States has not signed that accord,
which American conservatives oppose because it does not define the
fetus as a child with rights and because it bans the death penalty
for those under 18.
   President Bush, who attended the summit on Sunday, said that
this month the U.S. government will announce ambitious new
objectives for the year 2000 - reducing infant mortality and low
birth weight, increasing immunization and improving the health of
mothers and children.
   The final declaration, read by six youngsters from around the
world, pledges to combat disease and child labor, to promote family
planning, universal education and breast feeding.
   Its plan of action establishes these goals:
   -reducing child mortality below age 5 by one-third or to 70 per
1,000 births;
   -cutting maternal mortality rates by half;
   -reducing malnutrition among children under 5 by half;
   -assuring universal access to safe drinking water;
   -providing universal access to basic education, with 80 percent
of primary students finishing school;
   -cutting adult illiteracy by half;
   -protecting children in times of war.
   A clause was added to the declaration at Kuwait's urging
denouncing the suffering of children because of ``aggression,
foreign occupation and annexation.'' No specific countries were
named. Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, who was imprisoned by the
former Comunist regime in his country, said evil often has been
committed in the name of children - from the days of Adolf Hitler
to those of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``Thousands of times I have heard people defending their
servitude to a hated regime by the argument that they were doing it
only for their children,'' Havel told the assembly.
   In her speech, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
emphasized the importance of the family and urged parents to give
their children ``time, affection and wise counsel.''
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, twice his country's
education minister, said universal education provided the
foundation for Japan's economic success. He said public school
teachers should enjoy extra pay and status.
   ``There should be no more argument as to which should come first
- economic development or education,'' Kaifu said.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela emphasized the
problems of homeless children, child refugees, delinquents and
child laborers in Latin America.
   He said the international financial community must realize that
difficult conditions of international debt repayment have
``intolerable consequences'' for children.
   In his speech to the summit, Bush declared: ``We are gathered to
speak for the children of the earth. ...
   ``Let us affirm in this historic summit that these children can
be saved when we live up to our responsibilities as a world
community of adults, of parents.''

   Here is the text of the World Declaration
on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children, approved
by acclamation Sunday by 72 world leaders:
   1. We have gathered at the World Summit for Children to
undertake a joint commitment and to make an urgent universal appeal
- to give every child a better future.
   2. The children of the world are innocent, vulnerable and
dependent. They are also curious, active and full of hope. Their
time should be one of joy and peace, of playing, learning and
growing. Their future should be shaped in harmony and cooperation.
Their lives should mature, as they broaden their perspectives and
gain new experiences.
   3. But for many children, the reality of childhood is altogether
different.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Challenge</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   4. Each day, countless children around the world are exposed to
dangers that hamper their growth and development. They suffer
immensely as casualties of war and violence; as victims of racial
discrimination, apartheid, aggression, foreign occupation and
annexation; as refugees and displaced children, forced to abandon
their homes and their roots; as disabled; or as victims of neglect,
cruelty and exploitation.
   5. Each day, millions of children suffer from the scourges of
poverty and economic crisis - from hunger and homelessness, from
epidemics and illiteracy, from degradation of the environment. They
suffer from the grave effects of the problems of external
indebtedness and also from the lack of sustained and sustainable
growth in many developing countries, particularly the least
developed ones.
   6. Each day, 40,000 children die from malnutrition and disease,
including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, from the lack of
clean water and inadequate sanitation and from the effects of the
drug problem.
   7. These are challenges that we, as political leaders, must
meet.
   8. Together, our nations have the means and the knowledge to
protect the lives and to diminish enormously the suffering of
children, to promote the full development of their human potential
and to make them aware of their needs, rights and opportunities.
   9. Recent improvements in the international political climate
can facilitate this task. Through international cooperation and
solidarity, it should now be possible to achieve concrete results
in many fields - to revitalize economic growth and development, to
protect the environment, to prevent the spread of fatal and
crippling diseases and to achieve greater social and economic
justice. The current moves towards disarmament also mean that
significant resources could be realized for purposes other than
military ones, improving the well-being of children must be a very
high priority when these resources are reallocated.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Task</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   10. Enhancement of children's health and nutrition is a first
duty, and also a task for which solutions are now within reach. The
lives of tens of thousands of boys and girls can be saved every
day, because the causes of their death are readily preventable.
Child and infant mortality is unacceptably high in many parts of
the world, but can be lowered dramatically with means that are
already known and easily accessible.
   11. Further attention, care and support should be accorded to
disabled children, as well as to other children in very difficult
circumstances.
   12. Strengthening the role of women in general and ensuring
their equal rights will be to the advantage of the world's
children. Girls must be given equal treatment and opportunities
from the very beginning.
   13. At present, over 100 million children are without basic
schooling, and two thirds of them are girls. The provision of basic
education and literacy for all are among the most important
contributions that can be made to the development of the world's
children.
   14. Half a million mothers die each year fromn causes related to
childbirth. Safe motherhood must be promoted in all possible ways.
Emphasis must be placed on responsible planning of family size and
child spacing. The family, as a fundamental group and natural
environment for the growth and well-being of children, should be
given all necessary protection and assistance.
   15. All children must be given the chance to find their identity
and realize their worth in a safe and supportive environment,
through families and all other care-givers committed to their
welfare. They must be prepared for responsible life in a free
society. They should, from their early years, be encouraged to
participate in the cultural life of their societies.
   16. Economic conditions will continue to influence greatly the
fate of children, especially in developing nations. For the sake of
the future of all children, it is urgently necessary to ensure or
reactivate sustained and sustainable economic growth and
development in all countries and also to continue to give urgent
attention to an early, broad and durable solution to the external
debt problems facing developing debtor countries.
   17. These tasks require a continued and concerted effort by all
nations, through national action and international cooperation.

<HEAD>The Commitment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   18. The well-being of children requires political action at the
highest level. We are determined to take action.
   19. We, ourselves, hereby make a solemn commitment to give high
priority to the rights of children, to their survival and to their
protection and development. This will also ensure the well-being of
all societies.
   20. We have agreed that we will act together, in international
cooperation, as well as in our respective countries. We now commit
ourselves to the following 10-point program to protect the rights
of children and to improve their lives:
   (1) We will work to promote earliest possible ratification and
implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Programs to encourage information about children's rights should be
launched worldwide, taking into account the distinct cultural and
social values in different countries.
   (2) We will work for a solid effort of national and
international action to enhance children's health, to promote
prenatal care and to lower infant and child mortality in all
countries and among all peoples. We will promote the provision of
clean water in all communities for all their children, as well as
universal access to sanitation.
   (3) We will work for optimal growth and development in
childhood, through measures to eradicate hunger, malnutrition and
famine, and thus to relieve millions of children of tragic
sufferings in a world that has the means to feed all its citizens.
   (4) We will work to strengthen the role and status of women. We
will promote responsible planning of family size, child spacing,
breast-feeding and safe motherhood.
   (5) We will work for respect for the role of the family in
providing for children and will support the efforts of parents,
other care-givers and communities to nurture and care for children,
from the earliest stages of childhood through adolescent. We also
recognize the special needs of children who are separated from
their families.
   (6) We will work for programs that reduce illiteracy and provide
educational opportunities for all children, irrespective of their
background and gender; that prepare children for productive
employment and lifelong learning oportunities, i.e., through
vocational training; and that enable children to grow to adulthood
with a supportive and nurturing cultural and social context.
   (7) We will work to ameliorate the plight of millions of
children who live under especially difficult circumstanmces - as
victims of apartheid and foreign occupation; orphans and street
children and children of migrant workers; the displaced children
and victims of natural and man-made disasters; the disabled and the
abused, the socially disadvantaged and the exploited. Refugee
children must be helped to find new roots in life. We will work for
special protection of the working child and for the abolition of
illegal child labor. We will do our best to ensure that children
are not drawn into becoming victims of the scourge of illicit
drugs.
   (8) We will work carefully to protect children from the scourge
of war and to take measures to prevent further armed conflicts, in
order to give children everywhere a peaceful and secure future. We
will promote the values of peace, understanding and dialogue in the
education of children. The essential needs of children and families
must be protected even in times of war and in violence-ridden
areas. We ask that periods of tranquility and special relief
corridors be observed for the benefit of children, where war and
violence are still taking place.
   (9) We will work for common measures for the protection of the
environment, at all levels, so that all children can enjoy a safer
and healthier future.
   (10) We will work for a global attack on poverty which would
have immediate benefits for children's welfare. The vulnerability
and special needs of the children of the developing countries, and
in particular the least developed ones, deserve priority. But
growth and development need promotion in all states, through
national action and international cooperation. That calls for
transfers of appropriate additional resources to developing
countries as well as improved terms of trade, further trade
liberalization and measures for debt relief. It also implies
structural adjustments that promote world economic growth,
particularly in developing countries, while ensuring well-being of
the most vulnerable sectors of the population, in particular the
children.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Next Steps</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   21. The World Summit for Children has presented us with a
challenge to take action. We have agreed to take up that challenge.
   22. Among the partnerships we seek, we turn especially to
children themselves. We appeal to them to participate in this
effort.
   23. We also seek the support of the United Nations system, as
well as other international and regional organizations, in the
universal effort to promote the well-being of children. We ask for
greater involvement on the part of non-governmental organizations,
in complementing national efforts and joint international action in
this field.
   24. We have decided to adopt and implement a plan of action, as
a framework for more specific national and international
undertakings. We appeal to all our colleagues to endorse that plan.
We are prepared to make available the resources to meet these
commitments, as priorities of our national plans.
   25. We do this not only for the present generation, but for all
generations to come. There can be no task nobler than giving every
child a better future.

   A man was jailed on suspicion of using a
radio-operated model airplane to puncture the Goodyear blimp,
authorities say.
   The blimp, one of three owned by the tire company, landed safely
Sunday night with seven people aboard and only minor damage.
   John W. Moyer, 28, of Redondo Beach was booked for investigation
of assault with intent to do bodily harm. He was jailed on $5,000
bail.
   ``It wasn't any accident,'' Los Angeles Countybsheriff's Lt.
Paul Harman said. ``The plane buzzed the blimp seven or eight
times. The pilot and passengers clearly saw it.''
   The 192-foot blimp sustained a 3-foot tear in its fabric skin,
said pilot Nick Nicolary. The tear caused a helium leak that forced
the airship to make a quick landing.
   The blimp was hit as it came in for a landing in Carson, 10
miles from downtown Los Angeles. The model plane had a wing span of
4 feet, investigators said.
   ``I felt a shudder about a half-mile from the landing strip,''
Nicolary said. ``I never saw a plane. But witnesses told us they
did.''

<HEAD>Gunmen Burn Transmission Tower of Pro-Sandinista Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unidentified gunmen raided and burned
down a a pro-Sandinista radio station's transmission tower on the
eve of planned demonstrations against the government of President
Violeta Chamorro.
   The radio station manager, William Grisby, estimated damages at
more than $200,000. He did not speculate on who carried out
Sunday's attack.
   Grisby, a Sandinista and deputy in the National Assembly, has
had public differences in recent weeks with some Sandinista
leaders.
   His station, La Primerisima, is a cooperative that follows the
political line of the opposition Sandinista National Liberation
Front. The Sandinistas have been increasingly at odds with the
government in past weeks.
   The leftist Sandinistas governed Nicaragua until April, when
they were succeeded by Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed coalition.
   Her forces beat the Sandinistas in February elections that
signalled an end to a nine-year insurgency by U.S.-supported Contra
rebels.
   In recent days, the Sandinistas have issued calls for mass
protests against the new government. They have planned nationwide
marches for today to protest scheduled massive firings by the
government and other austerity measures.
   Describing the attack at the transmission station, Victor
Sanchez Lopez, who was on duty there at the time, said four men
came to the tower claiming to be inspectors for the Interior
Ministry.
   ``They forced me out of the room and then sprayed gasoline all
over the equipment and set it on fire,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nation's Most Comprehensive Fetal Disposal Law Takes Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state law requiring hospitals and clinics
to arrange for the burial or cremation of aborted fetuses instead
of flushing them into the sewer system became effective today.
   The measure, considered the nation's strictest, was strongly
opposed by medical groups, which contended that it added costs and
risks to disposal. Abortion rights advocates charged it might have
a chilling effect on women considering an abortion.
   ``I think it says that in Minnesota we regard the remains of
unborn babies with dignity and not something to be thrown down the
sewer system,'' said Brian Gibson, director of Pro-Life Action
Ministries of the Twin Cities.
   Gibson's group helped initiate the law by exhibiting an aborted
fetus it said came from a clinic's garbage container. The clinic
denied it.
   Dave Feinwachs, general counsel for the Minnesota Hospital
Association, complained that the law ``makes illegal the common,
sanitary practice of flushing fetal tissue into the sewer system.''
   ``Storing tissue in barrels of formaldehyde and trucking it
around is just plain stupid,'' he said.
   Thomas Webber, executive director of Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota, said the law is ``designed to give the inference that
the state of Minnesota is saying to women, `You just committed
murder. You just killed a little person.' ''
   The law also prohibits the burning of fetal tissue in hospital
incinerators, another common disposal method. The law applies to
miscarriages as well as induced abortions. It carries up to 90 days
in jail and a $700 fine.
   Planned Parenthood sued to block the 1987 law, contending it was
vague and would stifle abortions by adding costs and psychological
trauma. A federal judge agreed in 1989, but a federal appeals court
overruled him in August.
   Rebecca Palmer, a Planned Parenthood laywer, said the group
decided against appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court because of the
high court's 1989 decision giving states greater leeway to restrict
abortion.
   Laws, regulations or city ordinances in at least 15 other states
have called for special disposal of fetal remains, said Thomas
Strahan of the Rutherford Institute in Charlottesville, Va., a
non-profit legal services organization.
   But some of those laws were struck down as unconstitutional and
others do not have penalties or are too vague to be enforced, he
said.
   Minnesota's law is ``the most comprehensive and definitive,''
Strahan said.
   Hospitals and abortion clinics have complained to the Health
Department that some funeral homes and cemeteries have refused to
take fetal remains, fearing pickets from anti-abortion groups.
   Dan McInerney, deputy state health commissioner, said his
department will approve alternatives only when burial and cremation
prove impossible to obtain.
   ``We've been advising our members to cooperate,'' said Gary
Larson, executive director of the Minnesota Funeral Directors
Association. ``But on the other hand, a funeral home is not
responsible for handling fetal tissue. We are in business to
provide funerals for families of people who die.''
   Dale Carlson, president of the Minnesota Association of Cemetery
Officials, denied there is any widespread opposition to taking
fetuses.
   ``It's really not for us to pick and choose or question how they
(specimens for burial) got to that point,'' he said.
   Minnesota averages 16,000 to 17,000 abortions annually, and
Feinwachs said it is unclear how many miscarriages there are. It's
also unclear what the additional costs will be.
   ``Whatever it is, it's a waste of money because it's
unnecessary,'' he said. ``Now we are faced with the very sensitive
dilemma of telling them (women who have miscarried) that there's
this extra cost for a funeral.''

   A tanker plane crashed, killing two
people, during a battle against a forest fire that was itself
ignited by a crash that claimed two lives, authorities say.
   The firefighting Lockheed Neptune P-2V went down Sunday in sight
of a command post set up because of the first crash, of a
single-engine Cessna on Saturday.
   The irst crash ignited a fire in Olympic National Forest that
grew to 15 acres, the U.S. Forest Service said. Killed in the
accident were David L. Wurscher, 46, of Bremerton, and Tom Eller,
62, of Newman Lake, officials said.
   Wurscher owned the plane and was practicing search-and-rescue
under Eller's supervision, said Brian Holmes of the state
Aeronautics Division. Its wreckage was spotted in a steep, heavily
wooded area early Sunday, he said.
   The tanker was owned by Black Hills Aviation of Alamogordo,
N.M., and was under contract to the Forest Service, said company
President Arnold Kolb. The plane made one drop of retardant on the
fire, then ``settled into the trees,'' he said.
   Killed were the pilot, Ralph Glasgow of Honeyville, Utah, and
the co-pilot, Steve Bovey of Alamogordo, N.M., Kolb said. He did
not know their ages.

<HEAD>Mayor Looks at Payroll Tax for Crimefighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins wants to pay half the cost
of thousands more police officers through a new payroll tax on
residents and commuters who work in the city.
   From 5,000 to 7,500 new officers and 2,500 civilians to take
over desk work would be hired under recommendations to be unveiled
today by Police Commissioner Lee Brown, newspapers reported. The
city has 25,556 officers.
   The heftier force is part of a broader anti-crime strategy of
the mayor's in response to a string of shootings, many of them
involving children hit by stray bullets.
   ``We the people,'' Dinkins said when asked who would pay for the
plan.
   Newspaper have reported the mayor's crime-fighting proposals
would cost between $500 million and $1 billion.
   The payroll tax would start at 0.1 percent of a worker's
adjusted gross income next year and go to 0.15 percent the year
after that.
   The tax, which requires approval by the Legislature, would cost
a worker earning $50,000 in adjusted gross income $50 next year and
$75 in subsequent years. Employers would have to match the amount
their workers paid, The New York Times said today.
   Dinkins said Friday that hiring more police officers ``will
demonstrate that this administration has responded in an
intelligent, reasonable, responsible way'' to concerns about crime.
   Dinkins has insisted on waiting for Brown's recommendations
before committing himself to hiring a specific number of new
officers.

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
remained in serious but stable condition today at LDS Hospital's
intensive care unit, where he was returned Sunday after
gastrointestinal bleeding was detected.
   Church spokesman Don LeFevre said the internal bleeding was
discovered by doctors Sunday morning and apparently was not related
to two operations earlier to remove blood clots from his brain.
   The 91-year-old church leader was hospitalized Sept. 18,
complaining of severe headaches and difficulty swallowing. The next
day, doctors operated to remove two large blood clots from his
brain.
   On Sept. 23, the church leader underwent a second operation when
one of the subdural hematomas reformed. But brain scans since then
have shown no recurrence, LeFevre said.
   Earlier, LeFevre said if Benson continued to progress, he could
be released from the hospital before the faith's General Conference
next weekend. LeFevre was unsure Sunday when Benson would be
released from the hospital.
   ``We'll have to leave that up to the doctors,'' he said.
   Benson has been church president of the 7.5 million member

   Pope John Paul II has opened a worldwide
synod of bishops to address such questions as how to persuade more
men to become priests without abandoning rules demanding that they
be celibate and forsake marriage.
   The monthlong synod on the priesthood is to focus on the problem
of ``burnout'' among the church's `shepherds', challenges to
celibacy and the dwindling number of candidates interested in the
priesthood.
   The pontiff inaugurated the assembly on Sunday by celebrating a
solemn Mass in St. Peter's Basilica for some 1,000 priests, bishops
and cardinals from around the world.
   The synod, an advisory body that meets to discuss major issues
in the Roman Catholic Church, was called by John Paul to discuss
the formation of priests.
   ``Let me express the hope that your labors here will produce the
abundant fruit which the ecclesiastical community is expecting,''
the pope, clad in gold robes and miter, said in his homily.
   He noted that bishops from China, Vietnam and Laos were missing
from the gathering, and said he hoped they would join the synod
later.
   No reason was given for the absence of bishops Jean Khamse of
Laos and Cambodia, Paul Nguyen Van Hoa and Emmanuel Le Phong Thuan
of Vietnam, and Lucas Liu Hsien-Tang of China. The Vatican says the
church faces serious restrictions in those Communist countries.
   At the last synod in 1987, dealing with the laity, Vietnamese
prelates arrived midway through the assembly.
   The synod is expected to focus on the difficulty in maintaining
the church's rules ``in a world characterized by eroticism,'' as a
working document put it. The rules themselves are not expected to
be subjects for debate, however, as the pope has shown no
indication they might be changed.
   Several sexual scandals have embarrased the church in recent
months.
   The archbishop of Atlanta, Eugene A. Marino, resigned in July
following revelations of a two-year ``intimate relationship'' with
a young woman. In Newfoundland, Canada, a report in July by a
church-appointed commission said priests had sexually abused boys
in the province for more than a decade.
   ``Some priests question this requirement (celibacy) and some
candidates leave formation for this reason,'' the working document
said.
   It noted that in public opinion, celibacy is ``often
incomprehensible and ridiculed.'' A priest who accepts celibacy
``is sometimes looked upon in a strange way,'' it said.
   ``In this situation a priest can become totally isolated and
misunderstood to the point of becoming deeply demoralized,'' it
said. ``In some cases, the crisis in the priestly identity can
explain why priests leave the ministry.''
   The Vatican cited ``the phenomenon of burnout, from which
priests of all ages seem to suffer. They live in situations marked
by tiredness, resignation, lack of creativity.''
   The document lamented the shortage of priests and declining
number of candidates in some countries.
   ``The shortage of priests carries the further consequence that
those older priests who are still active might become overburdened,
thus making them subject to stress and to approach their work ...
simply as functionaries,'' it said.
   According to the latest statistics, there are 400,000 priests in
the world, down from 406,000 five years ago. In the United States,
students in the last four years of seminary numbered 3,698 this
year, compared with 7,855 in 1968.
   The 200 bishops at the synod included Cardinal Joseph Bernardin
of Chicago, Cardinal James Hickey of Washington, D.C., Archbishop
Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati and Bishop John Marshall of
Burlington, Vermont.

   Annoyance at the pilot of a World War II
Navy plane intruding on a air show quickly turned to horror when
the craft plunged into a lake, killing at least seven people.
   ``It was all over in just a split second. A plume of water,
parts up in the air. You heard the sound of the impact,'' said Stan
Sinn, a San Jose pilot who was among 350 spectators and competitors
who watched the crash Saturday.
   ``Then, in less than a minute, the lake looks like nothing ever
happened. It happened so quick if you had blinked your eye you
would have missed it.''
   Authorities believe seven people were on board. No one survived,
said Walt Smith, a Federal Aviation Administration official based
in nearby Santa Rosa.
   Six bodies have been recovered from the murky water, and
rescuers intended to search for a seventh victim today.
   Federal and county officials haven't released the identities of
those aboard the plane. But the family of San Rafael pilot-plane
owner Doug Lacey said they believe he was on board when it crashed.
   Officials have said that Lacey, 40, was at the controls of the
aircraft when it stopped at Sonoma County Airport Saturday morning
to refuel.
   But Lacey's family doubts the experienced pilot could have been
at the controls when it crashed, said Rosemary Wurst, a cousin.
   ``He was an excellent pilot. Somebody screwed up, but they don't
think Doug was flying the airplane,'' she said, adding that one of
the passengers migtt have been the pilot.
   Just before the crash, the bulky aircraft made four low passes
over the crowd and floating seaplanes meeting for the annual
``Seaplane Fly-In'' at Clear Lake, about 100 miles north of San
Francisco.
   ``We could see it was a dangerous situation. We were in the
process of getting our aircraft out of the air when he made the
last pass, the fatal one,'' Sinn said.
   The plane flew straight up to about 500 feet and stalled on its
final pass, Sinn said. An instant later, the wing dipped and the
plane turned upside down, plunging nose first into the water and
sending up a plume of water 60 to 70 feet high, he said.
   The plane landed in six feet of water about 50 yards offshore on
the lake's west end, the FAA said.
   Officials said an initial investigation indicates a heavy load
of fuel and passengers combined with high temperatures may have
caused the plane to stall.
   The plane had taken off from the Sonoma County Airport in Santa
Rosa, south of Lake County, investigators said.
   The plane, believed to date from 1945, was not part of the
seaplane convention, said Walter Windus, vice president of the
Seaplane Pilots Association, an event sponsor.
   ``He was strictly an intruder,'' said Windus, who witnessed the
crash. ``He saw an opportunity to show off and he took advantage of
it. He was doing air maneuvers that were not appropriate to that
type of aircraft.''
   Convention organizers tried desperately to contact the pilot of
the mystery plane by radio, planning to tell him to leave, but
could not reach him, he said.
   ``His behavior was so obnoxious,'' Windus said, ``I was going to
tell him to go away or I was going to report him to the FAA.''

Prize in 1973. Subs 11th graf ``His novel...'' to CORRECT, removing

<TEXT>
   Patrick White, a British-born writer
whose Nobel prize-winning fiction drew inspiration from life in
Australia's outback, has died, his literary agent said today. White
was 78.
   Barbara Mobbs, White's agent, said the author died Sunday of
respiratory failure after a lengthy illness.
   White, a rancher-turned-writer, frequently set his novels in the
outback. Considered one of this country's leading authors, his
works were required reading in many high schools and universities.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1973.
   The Sydney Morning Herald today eulogized White as the
``greatest Australian writer to date by far.''
   ``He transcended the cultural divisions from the past. He was
both contemporary and a traditionalist, an Australian and
simultaneously an international writer,'' the newspaper said.
   The poet, playwright and novelist was born on May 28, 1912, in
London. He was educated at King's College, Cambridge.
   He later worked as a ``jackaroo,'' or rancher, in New South
Wales state and then returned to England to study languages at
Cambridge.
   He served as an intelligence officer in the Royal Air Force in
the Middle East during World War II.
   ``Since the war, my life has been practically uneventful,''
White wrote for a 1955 reference work on authors. ``I returned to
Australia to a small property in Castle Hill, a town about 25 miles
from Sydney, where I breed schnauzers, saanen goats, cultivate
olives and citrus fruit, grow vegetables and live more or less off
my own produce.''
   His first novel, ``Happy Valley,'' published in 1939, was
awarded the Australian Literary Society Gold Medal. His 1955 novel,
``The Tree of Man,'' won the same prize.
   His novel, ``Eye of the Storm,'' portrayed the final days of an
elderly woman whose greedy relatives returned to Europe to await
her death. ``Eye of the Storm'' also explored Australians'
attitudes toward their European cultural roots.
   Essayist Margaret B. Lewis once wrote: ``White is a writer who
makes serious demands of his readers, straining prose to the utmost
poetic limits, putting severe pressure on syntax and vocabulary and
stretchin credence to an unusual degree in his search for the
transcendent in the lives of his idiosyncratic characters.''
   White's plays included the 1977 ``Big Toys'' about the
government's uranium mining policies, ``Signal Driver'' in 1982,
and ``Netherwood'' the following year. He also wrote a screenplay,
a book of verse and a 1981 autobiography, ``Flaws in the Glass: A
Self-Portrait.''
   Critics described his autobiography as a merciless
self-examination. It omitted his acts of generosity, such as his
support for Aboriginal education and his use of Nobel money to
establish an award for older Australian writers.
   In ``Flaws in the Glass,'' White wrote frankly of his
homosexuality, a subject he also had addressed in ``The Twyborn
Affair'' in 1979.
   There was no immediate word of survivors. A spokesman said
funeral arrangements were being kept private.

<HEAD>Disaster Declaration Sought Because of Gas Leak in Kazakhstan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Soviet Kazakhstan has called for
an independent, international inquiry into an explosion and toxic
gas release from a nuclear fuel factory in his republic.
   The official news agency Tass said Nursultan Nazarbayev,
president of Kazakhstan, sent a telegram to the Kremlin asking
officials to declare an ecological disaster near the Ulbinsky
metallurgical plant.
   The official news agency Tass said Saturday that a Sept. 12
explosion and fire at the plant affected ``a considerable part of
the population of Ust-Kamenogorsk.'' Ust-Kamenogorsk, a city of
20,000 people, lies near the border with China and Mongolia in the
Altai mountains.
   The plant is one of the largest producers of fuel for nuclear
power plants in the Soviet Union. The explosion and fire sent toxic
gas into the densely populated area around the plants. Preliminary
tests showed twice the permitted levels of beryllium in air and
water samples.
   Several people were injured in the blast. There was no report of
radiation release. Beryllium is a very light metal that can catch
fire easily and burn rapidly, vaporizing and releasing deadly
beryllium oxide.
   ``The public of Kazhakstan and population of the city demand
urgent measures to improve the situation and they demand
compensation for damage to their health,'' Nazarbayev said in his
telegram to Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Nazarbayev was quoted as saying that local authorities have
already declared the region around the plant an ecological disaster
zone.

   Twenty-one months after Pan Am Flight
103 exploded over Lockerbie, a public inquiry opened today focusing
on how similar terrorist bombings can be prevented.
   The hearing will look into security lapses but not criminal
responsibility for the crash on Dec. 21, 1988, which killed 270
people. That key question is still being investigated by police.
   The fathers of two of the mainly young victims urged that the
presiding judge should call airline and government witnesses to
account for the tragedy.
   ``Hopefully, they will go into the culpability of Pan Am, the
State Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, the British
government and the German government,'' said George Williams of
Joppatowne, Md.
   ``I want people from Pan Am jailed, people from the government
censured and fired that were involved in the cover-up, and I want
the criminals executed,'' he told reporters.
   Williams, whose son, Geordie, 24, was killed in the crash, and
Dr. Jim Swire, spokesman for the British relatives' group, U.K.
Families-Flight 103, were among about 30 spectators at the start of
the inquiry. Swire's daughter, Flora, 24, was killed.
   The fatal accident inquiry, expected to last three months, is
being held a hall converted into a court at Dumfries' Crichton
Royal Hospital 10 miles from Lockerbie.
   The judge, Sheriff Principal John S. Mowat, is due to decide
whether there were ``reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the
deaths might have been avoided,'' the Scottish Courts
Administration says.
   The first witness, Pan Am aircraft mechanic Paul Whiteley, 41,
testified that he led a crew which did routine maintenance on
Flight 103 at London's Heathrow Airport on Dec. 21, 1988, and
believed the Boeing 747 was airworthy.
   Alan Topp, 54, an air traffic controller at Prestwick, Scotland,
said Flight 103's radar blip suddenly vanished. He said he checked
other controllers and the pilot of a KLM plane to try to locate the
Pan Am flight but no one could find it.
   Scottish and U.S. officials said in December that there was not
enough evidence to prosecute anyone for the bombing.
   Prime suspects are Ahmed Jibril's radical Palestinian group, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and
Mohammed Abu Talb of the Popular Struggle Front, who was convicted
of bombings in Europe.
   The inquiry will examine security at Heathrow Airport in London,
the last stop for the New York-bound flight, and may hear testimony
from Pan Am baggage handlers at Frankfurt Airport, where the flight
originated.
   Police have said the bomb hidden in a radio-cassette recorder in
a suitcase was probably put aboard the flight in Frankfurt. The
flight changed from a Boeing 727 to a Boeing 747 at Heathrow.
   Scotland's senior law officer, Lord Fraser, the Lord Advocate
who is presenting the government's case, was quoted in an interview
today in Scotland's Daily Record as saying the bombers will be
caught.
   ``Make no mistake. The Lockerbie bombers will eventually be
caught. There will be no letup in the investigation ... we are much
further on than we were months ago,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Scottish investigators have denied a report in London's Sunday
Times that the investigation ``has almost ground to a halt''
because of ``incompetence, rivalry between police forces and
interference by foreign intelligence services.''

   A middle-aged housewife who fought to gain
government approval for one dam she bought and another she leased
has one more hurdle in her quest to build a family-owned
hydroelectric company - financing.
   Elaine Hitchcock is struggling to secure $800,000 in loans for
equipment and start-up costs to begin operating the dams in 1991.
   ``I made a choice to see these up and running and they will be.
I won't give up,'' she said last week.
   Mrs. Hitchcock, who decided in 1982 to establish a power
company, has worked out deals with utilities to buy power from her
and has persuaded family members to raise the capital needed to get
federal licenses on the dams.
   After spending $180,000 on consultants engineers,
environmentalists and other technical people to prepare her
applications, Mrs. Hitchcock gained approval in March 1989 from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   Mrs. Hitchcock, who lives in Kohler, a city of 1,650 about 50
miles north of Milwaukee near the Lake Michigan shoreline, said she
has contacted about 40 lending institutions for financing and
encountered ``absolute discrimination.''
   One bank told her ``no woman should get more than $50,000,''
said Bob Everett, a lawyer for Mrs. Hitchcock from Ashland, Ky.
   ``This lady has a iron stomach,'' he said. ``There are
corporations who cannot handle this sort of hostile business
climate.''
   Her quest for loans rests on a 1978 federal law that requires
utilities to purchase power from private operators. The state has
agreed to reduce interest on her debts from market rates to 3
percent once loans are obtained.
   Mrs. Hitchcock, who said she is in her early 50s, began
researching in 1982 the idea of buying dams abandoned in the 1950s
and 1960s. Her husband is an engineer.
   She reasoned the dams would provide a renewable and
environmentally safe source of energy. The profits - perhaps
$100,000 a year - would ensure financial stability for herself,
husband and three adult children.
   Friends and relatives questioned whether it was worth it; at one
point her family told her to quit. Only a handful of people across
the nation have started family-owned hydroelectric plants. One
recently failed in Indiana.
   In 1985, Mrs. Hitchcock leased a dam on the Eau Galle River and
a year later bought the Rock River dam and its power plant in
Watertown for $3,122.
   Mrs. Hitchcock's son, Carl, 30, has leased two more dams for the
family - one on the Sheboygan River and another on the Red Cedar
River. The dams have working generators but are awaiting federal
licenses.
   Northern States Power Co. signed a 20-year contract to buy
electricity from Mrs. Hitchcock, and a similar deal is about to be
signed with Wisconsin Electric Power Co., she said.
   Mrs. Hitchcock estimates the Eau Galle River project will
furnish the yearly electrical needs of as many as 30 homes.
   Dan Moran, an analyst for the state Division of Energy, said
about 20 small hydroelectric plants, owned by mostly local
governments, operate in Wisconsin. Another 20 are idle but have
working equipment that could provide a ``reasonable payback'' for
private owners, he said.
   But John Bartel, a spokesman for Wisconsin Electric, the state's
largest electric utility, said Mrs. Hitchcock's venture is risky
and faces unpredictable weather and operating costs.
   Last year, only 2 percent of the utility's output came from the
16 hydroelectric plants it operates, he said.
   ``She's got a tough row to hoe,'' he said. ``I hope she is
successful.''

<HEAD>Source Tells Paper a Man Known by Humphrey is Also Suspect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police have found evidence indicating
the presence of a man other than the most prominent suspect at the
scenes of two of the five college student slayings, an unidentified
source told one newspaper.
   A second newspaper has cited an unnamed source that a man known
to that suspect, Edward Lewis Humphrey, is also a suspect in the
five murders.
   Humphrey, who has not been charged in the slayings, has been
jailed in Brevard County for a month on $1 million bond in the
beating of his grandmother.
   Laboratory analysis shows another man left important physical
evidence at the scene of at least two of the five murders last
month, law enforcement officials told the St. Petersburg Times.
   Investigators still consider Humphrey a suspect in the slayings
based on other evidence, however, and they are awaiting more lab
test results. Those tests could take as long as six months to
complete.
   If officials know who left the physical evidence at the two
crime scenes, they aren't saying. But they do say it's possible the
killer may have worked in concert with a second person.
   The mutilated bodies of Sonja Larson, 18, and Christina Powell,
17, were found Aug. 26. The next morning, Christa Hoyt, 18, was
found decapitated. Manuel Taboada and Tracy Paules, both 23, were
found dead Aug. 28.
   On Sunday, the Tampa Tribune quoted a law-enforcement source it
did not identify as saying that a ``person known to be an associate
of Humphrey is a suspect'' and that his name became known to
investigators soon after the killings.
   The man was living in Gainesville at the time of the murders but
his whereabouts now are unclear, the source said.
   The lawyer representing Humphrey said he finds it hard to
believe the slayings could have been the work of more than one
person.
   ``I'm no expert on crime scenes and crime suspects, but it
doesn't seem likely to me to be a multiple participant case,''
Brevard County public defender J.R. Russo said.
   ``We're not going to exclude the possibility that more than one
person could be involved,'' said Gainesville police Sgt. Dick
Gerard, spokesman for the 150-member task force investigating the
slayings.
   A day after the fourth and fifth victims were found in late
August, Gainesville police Chief Wayland Clifton said he believed
the killings were the work of one person.
   Humphrey faces trial Oct. 8 on an aggravated battery charge in
an attack on 79-year-old Elna Hlavaty. Relatives identified
Humphrey, 18, as her assailant on the night of the attack, but Mrs.
Hlavaty has since denied she was beaten by Humphrey.

   The foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi
Arabia met over the weekend, Iran said today, in the first talks
between senior officials from the countries since they broke
diplomatic ties 2{ years ago.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said that during the
meeting Sunday in New York, the diplomats discussed restoring
diplomatic relations and traded views on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The ground-breaking meeting apparently did not go much beyond
both sides spelling out their positions. But it was the most
positive sign yet that the two countries may be moving toward a
rapprochement amid the political upheaval triggered by Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.
   A reconciliation would help draw Iran into the anti-Iraq camp
and intensify Saddam Hussein's isolation.
   Saddam has been courting neighboring Iran, which was at war with
Iraq from 1980-1988, for help in puncturing the U.N. economic
embargo imposed after the invasion.
   Saudi-Iranian ties were severed in a dispute over the number of
Iranians allowed to attend the annual Moslem pilgrimage to holy
sites in Saudi Arabia. There had been several violent incidents
that the Saudis said were incited by Iran's fundamentalist leaders.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency dispatch said the meeting
between Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Prince Saud al-Faisal of
Saudi Arabia took place at U.N. headquarters. The official agency
did not say how long it lasted.
   The ministers were in New York for a global summit on children.
   IRNA quoted Velayati as telling Prince Saud that the main
obstacle to resumption of relations was the dispute over the number
of Iranians allowed into Saudi Arabia to worship at Islam's holiest
shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   The Iranian agency quoted Prince Saud as saying his government
is eager to resolve this issue before the next pilgrimage in June.
The agency said Prince Saud ``promised that his government will do
its best so that Iranian Moslems perform their rituals in a
suitable matter.''
   In 1987, violent riots in Mecca killed 402 people. Most victims
were Iranians defying Saudi orders that ban political rallying
during the pilgrimage season.
   The following year, the Saudis announced a quota system that
restricted the number of pilgrims allowed to participate in the
annual event to 1,000 per one million population for each country.
   The Iranias protested the move, which would have cut the size
of their contingent by more than two thirds - from 150,000 to
45,000. They called for stripping King Fahd of Saudi Arabia of
custodianship of the holy shrines.
   In April 1988, the Saudis severed relations with Tehran,
accusing Iran of subversion and terrorism.
   The Iranian complaints grew louder this year after 1,426 people
died in a stampede in a pedestrian tunnel in Mecca. Tehran accused
the Saudis of failing to provide adequate protection for the
pilgrims.
   During its 1980-88 war with Iraq, Iran accused the Saudis of
bankrolling Baghdad's war effort.
   Also during Sunday's meeting, Velayati explained Iran's position
on the Persian Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, IRNA said.
   It said Velayati told Prince Saud that Iran ``is strongly
opposed to the presence of foreign forces in the gulf and
especially holy lands.''
   ``Regional countries must cooperate for the security of the gulf
and liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation,'' the news agency
quoted Velayati as saying.
   Saudi Arabia invited the multinational force onto its territory,
fearing an Iraqi invasion. About 200,000 U.S. and other foreign
troops have massed in the Persian Gulf, mostly in Saudi Arabia, to
counter Iraq.
   Baghdad's government, capitalizing on Iran's anti-Western
sentiment, moved quickly after the invasion of Kuwait to formalize
a peace deal with the Iranians, accepting all their terms for
settling a border dispute.
   Although Tehran says it is committed to the U.N. embargo of
Iraq, there have been increasing reports it is allowing food and
other goods to move across the common border to Iraq.

   India's Supreme Court today ordered the
government to halt its job quota program. The court said it hoped
its temporary injunction would stop a wave of student protests and
suicides.
   The five-judge panel also advanced the date for hearing
arguments on the legality of the program by two weeks to Oct. 25,
Press Trust of India reported.
   The court said the government could continue preparations for
carrying out the plan, which reserves 27 percent of federal jobs
for low-caste Hindus.
   The government is assembling a list of thousands of castes which
will qualify for preference in job applications. Another 22 percent
already are set aside for the lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy
of Indian society, tribespeople and the so-called untouchables.
   Acting Chief Justice Ranganath Mishra said he hoped that peace
would be restored while the issue was being studied by the nation's
highest court. The temporary injunction will remain in effect until
the Supreme Court rules on the legality of the quotas.
   At least 70 people have died in demonstrations against the plan,
announced Aug. 7 by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. About 20 were
upper-caste students who committed suicide by self-immolation or
poisoning after claiming they were victimized by the plan.
   In Parliament, the government faced a separate problem when it
failed to pass a constitutional amendment extending federal rule in
the northern state of Punjab, where Sikh militants are fighting for
independence.
   The state govenment in Punjab was dismissed in 1987 and replaced
by federal rule, which the Constitution limits to three years.
Amending the document requires a two-thirds majority.
   In a surprise move aimed at embarassing the government, the
opposition Congress Party refused to support the bill. Leaders of
all the parties were summoned to the speaker's chambers to find a
way out of the impasse.
   Singh' 10-month-old government suffered another setback when the
speaker of the legislature agreed to hold a debate on a motion
seeking to censure the government for mishandling the student
protest.
   The motion, if passed, would put pressure on the government to
quit, said Kewal Verma, a parliamentary analyst.
   ``There is no legal obligation on the part of the government to
resign, but it would amount to its defeat in moral terms,'' said
Verma.
   In the parliament, Congress Party members accused Singh of being
``obstinate'' for refusing to suspend or reconsider the affirmative
action plan. ``Down, down, resign, resign,'' they shouted as Singh
stood up to speak. He was prevented from addressing the house.
   ``Can't you see there is blood in your hands,'' said Congress
lawmaker Ajit Panja. Some members advanced menacingly at Singh but
were stopped by colleagues. ``You are a bloodstained politician,''
said Panja.
   Former Congress minister Vasant Sathe said he was beginning a
``fast unto death'' until Singh stops ``police terror'' on the
students.
   In the northern town of Jammu, 17-year-old student Sandeep
Sharma set himself on fire today in the latest suicide bid to
protest the job quotas. He suffered third-degree burns over most of
his body.
   At least 20 students have died in the past 12 days from
self-inflicted injuries. Most left notes blaming Singh's job
policy. In addition, 50 people have died by police gunfire in
street battles.
   Singh announced the policy Aug. 7 to increase the quota for
low-caste Indians in government jobs to 49 percent, saying he was
seeking social justice for Indians discriminated against because of
the social station of their birth.
   Upper-caste students say reverse discrimination will deprive
them of government jobs for which they are better qualified.
   Singh also is facing a revolt in his own Janata Dal party over
the issue.
   Former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal resigned his parliamentary
seat on Sunday, and dissidents called for a new party leader. But
the party's parliament bloc, a key forum, gave Singh a vote of
confidence.
   Allied parties whose tacit support keep the governing coalition
in power also have attacked the government's handling of the
demonstrations, although none has criticized the idea of reserving
jobs for deprived classes.

<TEXT>
   Michel Leiris, a writer who helped lead the
surrealist movement in the 1920s and later authored innovative
studies of ethnic groups, has died at his country home, associates
said today. He was 89.
   He died Sunday in the town of Saint Hilaire, southwest of Paris.
The cause was not disclosed.
   Leiris published his first work at the age of 25 - a collection
of poems. He became involved with surrealist writers and artists,
and was a contributor to the movement's journal, ``The Surrealist
Revolution.''
   He broke with the movement in 1929 and two years later joined a
two-year research mission across central Africa. Upon returning to
France, he published an account of the mission, ``Phantom Africa,''
combining poetry and stream-of-consciousness prose with more
traditional ethnological analysis.
   He also accepted a post at the Musee de l'Homme (Museum of Man)
in Paris as head of its section on sub-Saharan Africa.
   Later works included ``L'Age d'Homme'' (The Age of Man) and ``La
Regle du Jeu'' (The Rule of the Game), as well as art criticism and
essays about his trips to China, Cuba, Africa and the Caribbean.
   In his later years, he sought privacy. He refused to accept the
National Grand Prize of Letters in 1980, saying he did not want to
be media topic, and he was rarely photographed.
   No information was immediately available regarding his survivors
or funeral arrangements.

   Boy Scouts cleaning highway litter
gave two newlyweds a belated wedding present when they found a
bundle of checks and cards stolen from them earlier this month.
   A soggy cardboard box spotted over the weekend by the White Beat
Lake troop also contained a copy of vows Cynthia and Karl
Rutherford read to each other at their wedding in Eagan Sept. 1.
   The box was stolen from the couple's pickup truck the day after
the wedding, along with Cynthia's wedding dress, her husband's
tuxedo and their luggage.
   ``It kind of put a halt to their honeymoon all at once,'' said
Gordon Byers, the bride's father. ``They came back home Sunday
because they were penniless.''
   Byers estimated that $500 in cash and checks were in the box
when it was stolen. The cash was not recovered.
   Scouts said they were surprised to find the box while they were
cleaning Minnesota Highway 96 in Grant Township as part of the
Minnesota Transportation Department's adopt-a-highway program.
   ``We just expected to find the usual highway trash,'' Ryan True,
11.
   ``He said the same thing I did,'' said True's mother, Sue.
```How could someone rob someone on their honeymoon?' It just makes
you sick.''
   Byers said his daughter would be happy to have the greeting
cards back.
   ``Some of them had special messages on them,'' he said. ``Some
of these people haven't even been thanked.''

<HEAD>Budget Pact Forestalls Federal Shutdown, But Budget Fight Not Over
Yet</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 8th graf, White House... to UPDATE with Bush planning
to sign stopgap bill this afternoon; edits to tighten</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and key lawmakers avoided a
crisis as the new fiscal year dawned today but they now must
convince an election-year Congress to vote for $134 billion in new
taxes and widespread cuts in federal programs.
   ``It's going to be very difficult for us,'' House Republican
Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said today. But White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu said President Bush would lobby hard and, ``I
think in the long run it will be supported by a majority of
Republicans.''
   ``It's a tough sale,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, one of many
lawmakers who was troubled by what he was hearing of the package
Sunday.
   Democrats, too, were expected to swallow hard before agreeing to
raising Medicare premiums while cutting the benefits, increasing
taxes on gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes, and trimming everything
from defense to student loans.
   And despite a claimed $500 billion in deficit reduction, it
would stretch out the goal of a balanced budget and let the
national debt increase another $1 trillion.
   The $40 billion in deficit reduction for the fiscal year
beginning today would still leave a record annual deficit of $254
billion.
   Following President Bush's announcement of the budget accord at
the White House Rose Garden on Sunday, the House and Senate easily
approved and sent to Bush legislation avoiding a government
shutdown which was threatened for today.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the stopgap
resolution, which keeps the government going for five more days
while more work is done on the budget, would be signed by Bush this
afternoon.
   Because of the delays in enacting the fiscal 1991 budget the new
fiscal year was starting without any of the normal spending bills
required by law for government operations.
   But while the stopgap bill was approved easily, the votes in no
way were endorsements for the budget agreement.
   Michel, appearing on NBC's ``Today'' show, said he wouldn't be
surprised if the budget pact failed to pass its first test votes
later this week.
   ``This is not going to be easy for everyone, but it is
necessary. ...'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said on the same
program.
   Sununu, who appeared on ABC-TV, said the president would
``support it aggressively.''
   ``Nit-pickers may have a field day, because the easy vote in
this case is to find something you don't like and vote no,'' Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Sunday.
   Many on both sides seem ready to do just that.
   ``I don't think its a compromise. I think it's totally caving in
to the Democratic liberals ... that's going to tax us right into a
recession,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
   ``It looks like a tax on people who are hurting the most -
excise taxes,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``And you leave
the richest of the rich alone.''
   The budget deal would raise taxes $134 billion over the next
five years, cut benefit programs $119 billion and, for the
remainder, trim defense and domestic programs.
   The most attractive part of the package politically may be that
it is the only thing being offered to prevent the 33 percent,
across-the-board spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman law. Those cuts,
if they took effect, would cause everything from eliminating
student loans to furloughing federal employees.
   ``There are no pleasant choices here,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio. ``The president, as well as the Democratic leadership, is
going to have to help sell it to the country.''
   Bush promised to do just that. ``I will do everything I can to
generate support from the American people for this compromise,'' he
said.
   He'll also have to work hard on his not-always-loyal
congressional Republicans. One House GOP leader, Rep. Newt Gingrich
of Georgia, refused to attend the Rose Garden ceremony Sunday even
though he was one of the negotiators.
   Aside from the Gramm-Rudman cuts, the selling points amount
mainly to vague promises about beneficial effects on the economy.
Presumably, the Federal Reserve would be able to reduce interest
rates if the Treasury's insatiable craving for credit were reduced.
   But the downsides of the package are much more clear. Even as
the agreement was being announced, a group that lobbies for more
benefits for the elderly was drumming up opposition.
   ``It places a disproportionate amount of deficit reduction on
the backs of older mericans,'' said Martha McSteen, president of
the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
   About $60 billion of the deficit reduction would come from the
Medicare system, roughly half by containing payments to health care
providers and the rest from the elderly and all taxpayers.
   The Medicare payroll tax that now stops when a taxpayer's income
hits $51,300 would keep going until a $73,000 income cap. State
employees who currently don't pay the Medicare tax or Social
Security would be brought into the system.
   Meanwhile, Medicare patients would pay more of their doctor
bills. The annual deductible would double in two years from $75 to
$150; coverage for clinical testing would drop from full to 80
percent; and monthly premiums would rise from $28.60 to about $34
next year. By 1995, they would rise to about $54 a month.
   ``It's asking the elderly to take a very hard hit,'' said Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ``The elderly didn't cause this problem. I
plan to vote against it.''
   Strident opposition also was certain to raising the gasoline tax
by 12 cents by next summer, increasing the cigarette tax by 8 cents
over the next two years and even a $25 annual fee on boaters.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the deputy Democratic leader, said
the best selling points for the plan may be the things that it does
not contain: a capital gains tax cut, anathema to most Democrats;
an income tax rate increase opposed by Republicans; or a cut in
Social Security benefits, considered poison by almost everyone in
Congress.
   The president and congressional leadership have set a tight
timetable, with the first direct votes on the plan by Friday and an
Oct. 19 deadline for enacting the deal.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has put to rest his ``no new
taxes'' pledge with a $134 billion flourish, developing a plan with
key congressional leaders that will prompt several weeks of
tenacious debate. But it won't solve the deficit crisis.
   As the budget summit was ending in the White House Rose Garden
on Sunday, Bush's budget director was releasing a new deficit
projection that showed that the agreement's $40 billion in 1991
savings already had been lost to economic reality.
   Richard Darman blamed the nation's poor economic performance and
the spiraling costs of the savings and loan bailout for the
worsening figures. He said the fiscal year that begins today would
end with a deficit of at least $254 billion, even if Congress goes
along with the budget package.
   A big if. And, without the package, the deficit would soar to
$294 billion.
   Just because an impressive array of Republican and Democratic
leaders shared the platform with Bush in announcing the $500
billion, five-year agreement doesn't mean it's a done deal.
   Far from it. The agreement could have difficulty winning
approval in both the House and Senate, although leaders can mount a
strong case that it may be the last hope Congress and the White
House may ever have for reaching accord on cutting the deficit.
   One key conservative, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2
Republican leader in the House, walked away from the pact and would
not pose with Bush in the Rose Garden with the others.
   And with only three weeks remaining to enact the agreement, a
minority in the Senate could keep the measure from passage through
the threat of filibuster and other parliamentary maneuvering.
   For all the ballyhooing by Bush and congressional leaders about
the boldness of the ``compromise'' plan, the pact - although
ambitious in scope, particularly in later years - will not keep the
fiscal 1991 deficit from being a record shortfall in excess of $250
billion.
   And it exacts a hard price on many Americans.
   Of the total $500 billion deficit reduction package, $133.8
billion is to come from new taxes and other revenue increases.
Taxes on gasoline would more than double, Medicare premiums would
rise, farm subsidies would be cut and government services would
decline.
   Well-off families earning over $100,000 would find new limits on
what they could deduct from their taxes. And sharp new levies would
be slapped on nonessential items like cigarettes, booze and luxury
boats.
   Bush said he would ``do my level best to take this case to the
American people,'' but he didn't elaborate. White House officials
said a prime-time television address to the nation was a good
possibility.
   The president made the vow just days after he told Republican
audiences in the Midwest he would take his case against
congressional Democrats to ``every state in the nation.''
   Bush had scheduled a month of travels for October to speak on
behalf of GOP candidates. Presumably, he will add a call for
enactment of the bipartisan agreement to his stock speech.
   The president has a history of compromising, particularly on
domestic issues. So his willingness to stump the nation for an
agreement that undoes two major tenets of his 1988 presidential
campaign should not be a surprise.
   Still, in going along with the pact, Bush formally put an end to
his ``no new taxes'' campaign vow. And he also abandoned, at least
for now, a feature that until Thursday he was insisting must be a
part of any budget compromise - a lower capital gains tax.
   Not only did Bush not get a capital gains tax reduction in the
package, but the final measure also would have the effect of
increasing taxes on the wealthy - both through a 10 percent fee on
luxuries and through new limits on tax deductions for higher income
families.
   White House aides pointed to a variety of other incentives in
the plan designed to spur business investment and business growth.
   But the fact remained that Bush gave up plenty to get a budget
agreement.
   ``I don't think we're going to get into the hot rhetoric of what
gain or loss there is in ... political terms,'' said Bush's chief
of staff, John Sununu. ``There will be a lot of time for that to
take place in the days and weeks ahead.''
   One final irony is that as negotiators were working hard to come
up with even $40 billion in tax increases and spending cuts for the
fiscal year that begins today - about $10 billion smaller a package
than originally planned - budget officials were privately upping
the estimate the deficit by an identical $40 billion.
   Before Sunday, budget officials warned that without a budget
agreement the deficit for fiscal 1991 would be some $250 billion, a
record.
   Then Darman on Sunday said the deficit - even with the agreement
- will be somewhere around $254 billion. That's a far cry from the
$64 billion deficit figure called for under Gramm-Rudman.
   Faced with such a huge gap, Congress decided to change the
Gramm-Rudman target and give itself and the White House another
five years - until 1998 - to balance the budget.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Case on Discrimination Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether U.S. businesses break the law if they discriminate against
Americans they employ outside the country.
   The justices, setting the stage for an important ruling, said
they will decide whether Congress intended a major anti-bias law to
reach beyond the nation's borders.
   A federal appeals court, ruling in a case from Saudi Arabia,
said the law has no effect outside the country. But federal trial
judges have ruled in several other cases that the law does apply
abroad.
   The justices acted on appeals by the Bush administration and a
former oil industry employee.
   Ali Boureslan of El Paso, Texas, is a naturalized citizen who
was born in Lebanon. An engineer, Boureslan began working in 1979
for Aramco Services Co., the Houston-based subsidiary of the
Arabian American Oil Co. (Aramco).
   He was transferred to Saudi Arabia in 1980, and alleges that
once there he was subjected to racial and religious discrimination.
   After filing a complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, Boureslan sued Aramco Services and its
parent company. He charged them with violating an anti-bias law
called Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   The two companies contested the suit, contending that Title VII
does not apply to alleged discrimination outside the United States.
   A federal trial judge agreed, and threw out the suit. Last
February, the entire 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
dismissal by a 9-5 vote.
   In urging the justices to reverse the appeals court ruling, EEOC
and Justice Department lawyers said such a limiting interpretation
of Title VII's reach ``would withdraw the act's protection from the
many Americans who spend a portion of their careers abroad.''
   The government appeal relied heavily on an exemption written
into the law, one that says the law ``shall not apply to an
employer with respect to employment of aliens outside any state.''
   That exemption ``would be entirely superfluous if the act did
not apply abroad in the first place,'' the government appeal
contended.
   But the 5th Circuit court said the exemption could be read to
reflect ``a congressional intent to provide Title VII coverage to
aliens employed within (but not outside) the United States.''
   The cases are EEOC vs. Arabian American Oil Co., 89-1838, AND
Boureslan vs. Arabian American Oil Co., 89-1845.

<HEAD>Administration Supports Baltics for Membership in European Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, hosting a 35-nation
European conference, today gave its support to full membership for
the three Baltic republics and said Albania may be allowed to
participate as an observer.
   The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
seeks to bridge East-West differences, is preparing to hold a
summit meeting in Paris Nov. 19-21.
   The projected centerpiece is the signing of a treaty between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact to reduce
U.S. and Soviet tanks, anti-aircraft artillery and other
non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The treaty is nearing completion. The last roadblocks may be
cleared at a meeting Wednesday between Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters, said the Bush
administration would not go ahead with the summit unless the treaty
is ready to be signed.
   ``We do expect that things will shape up so that we will have an
agreement at the time,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The 35 nations are all the European countries except Albania
plus the United States and Canada. East Germany will drop out later
in the week when it is merged into West Germany to become one
nation.
   However, the U.S. official said, the Baltic states - he referred
to them as countries - of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia want to
participate in the conference as observers or members.
   ``We do hope they will be in a position to join,'' he said.
   That could mean a further separation of the Baltics from the
Soviet Union.
   Albania, meanwhile, is emerging from diplomatic isolation. Its
participation in the conference would expand European membership.
   Among the issues facing the 35 foreign ministers here is where
to base the small, permanent secretariat that will be approved.
   Czechoslovakia has strong support in pitching for Prague.
``That's a real possibility,'' the official said.
   He stressed, meanwhile, that the Bush administration does not
want the European group to take on military functions.
   The official said that role is reserved for NATO, and it will
remain important so long as the Soviets have a large army.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Give Final OK To New Religion Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The national legislature gave final approval today
to a law on freedom of conscience aimed at ending decades of
repression against religious believers.
   The Supreme Soviet approved the law by a vote of 341-2, with no
abstentions.
   The legislators approved the law in principle on Wednesday but
met again today to resolve a dispute between the two chambers over
a clause permitting the use of school buildings for religious
classes after regular hours.
   The legislature voted 303-46 with 16 abstentions to remove the
clause after a confusing and tedious parliamentary dispute.
   One of the chambers, the Council of the Union, had voted to
remove the clause last week but the other, the Council of
Nationalities, had no quorum for a vote.
   Patriarch Alexi II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, said he
favored the clause, as long as parental approval is required for
students to attend after-school religious classes.
   ``If we remove this part of the law today, we would be taking a
step backward in our democratic development,'' the patriarch said.
He also said church activities are now restricted to within the
walls of churches because all schools were nationalized after the
revolution.
   Historian Roy Medvedev, a member of the Supreme Soviet, also
supported the clause, arguing that in some small villages there is
no place for students to gather for religious classes except public
schools.
   But other delegates argued that strict separation of church and
state precludes the use of public schools for religious classes.
   Ukrainian legislator Sergei Ryabchenko argued that allowing
schools to be used for religious classes could ``ignite religious
tensions'' in some areas of the Soviet Union such as the western
Ukraine, where there is conflict between Ukrainian Catholic and
Russian Orthodox Churches.
   The legislature's agreement to drop the clause came after a
meeting of a joint committee from the two chambers.
   The lawmakers made other small changes, voting to tax the
profits of businesses run by religious organizations at the same
rate as other businesses.
   Soviet religious leaders said Thursday they are satisfied with
the law but believe it should be shorter, clearer and firmer.
   After the revolution, the Communists seized some church property
and assets and prohibited the teaching of religion. They converted
some churches into factories and established an officially atheist
society.
   The new law forbids the government from interfering in the
practice of religion. It also improves the legal status of
religious organizations, guarantees the right to study religious
doctrine and calls for a religious council to advise the government
on human rights.
   Western scholars estimate a quarter of the 285 million Soviet
people practice some faith, and the number appears to be rising
fast as official tolerance replaces hard-line Communist opposition
to religion.
   In recent years, churches confiscated by the government have
been reopened, Jews have been allowed to hold Hebrew classes,
state-run television has broadcast holiday church services and
government propaganda against religion has subsided.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Libel Suit Against New Yorker Writer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating a libel lawsuit against Janet Malcolm, a staff writer
for The New Yorker magazine, by a psychologist who says she made up
quotes attributed to him.
   The justices said they will review a federal appeals court
ruling that last year threw out Jeffrey Masson's suit.
   The appeals court ruling was criticized by some who said it
recognized ``the right to fake quotes.''
   Specifically, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
public figures who sue for libel over allegedly altered quotes must
show that the quotes are not even ``rational interpretations'' of
what was said.
   Private citizens who sue for libel must prove only that the
sued-over statements are false and were made negligently. But
public figures who sue for libel must prove the statements are
false and were made with ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless
disregard of falsity.
   In dismissing Masson's suit, the 9th Circuit court said,
``Malice will not be inferred from evidence showing that the quoted
language does not contain the exact words used ... provided that
the fabricated quotations are either rational interpretations of
ambiguous remarks made by the public figure ... or do not alter the
substantive content of unambiguous remarks actually made by the
public figure.''
   The appeals court did not rule on whether Ms. Malcolm actually
fabricated quotes attributed to Masson, a former projects director
of the Sigmund Freud Archives.
   It instead said the fake quotes alleged by Masson, when compared
to what he contends he said, do not amount to actual malice.
   The appeals court vote was 2-1. Judge Alex Kozinski, in a
dissenting opinion, said, ``While the courts have a grave
responsibility under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of
the press, the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my
view, a concomitant of a free press.''
   Ms. Malcolm's two-part article in The New Yorker focused on
Masson's struggle with other archives officials over Sigmund
Freud's abandonment of a theory that certain mental illnesses
originate in sexual abuse during childhood.
   The article discussed Masson's claim that his contract with the
archives was terminated because he made public his views that Freud
abandoned the theory simply to further his career and placate his
colleagues.
   The article subsequently was published in book form by Alfred A.
Knopf Inc. Masson's suit named The New Yorker and Knopf as
defendants also.
   The case is Masson vs. The New Yorker, 89-1799.

   Workmen set up floodlights outside the
Reichstag today and camera crews from around the world filmed the
carnival-like scene at the Brandenburg Gate, in the final countdown
to German unification.
   It looked more like a Hollywood set than the remnants of one of
the most sinister sites of the Cold War.
   Organ grinders played, young women hastily planted new flowers
and the sellers of Soviet bloc military memorabilia could hardly
keep with the demand from thousands of visitors.
   At midnight Tuesday, as many as million people are expected to
pack the squares in front of the Reichstag and at the Brandenburg
Gate 200 yards away. Chancellor Helmut Kohl will lead the official
celebrations close to where the Berlin Wall once divided the city.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper said that 10,000 leftist
radicals were expected to rampage in Berlin on Tuesday night and
into Wednesday to disrupt the unity fest. West Berlin police
spokesman Joerg Gallas said he thinks the predicted number was
``exaggerated,'' but said authorities were prepared for trouble
from leftist and rightist extremists.
   ``For 40 years, there was dictatorship in East Germany,'' said
60-year-old Ferdinand Scheben of the West German city of Cologne.
``Now, I'm glad that we're finally unifying in a peaceful way.''
   Scheben promised to be at the Tuesday night celebrations. ``I
plan to film the whole thing,'' he said, holding up his video
camera.
   Germans from East and West, joined by thousands of foreign
tourists, will start the nation's party of the century Tuesday
afternoon.
   The beer will flow and fireworks will light up the sky as the
Germans usher in unification with a wild street celebration that
will be repeated in dozens of cities nationwide.
   Still, there is trouble on the horizon, as many predict clashes
between leftist and rightist radicals.
   ``I'm afraid that's something we will have to count on,'' said
West Berlin policeman Manfred Seelig.
   But for the jolly, barrel-chested Seelig, there was much more
satisfaction in thinking about the historic merger.
   ``Certainly, everyone thought it would come, but no one, not
even the politicians thought it would come so quickly,'' said the
42-year-old policeman.
   Around him, there were dozens of cranes and booms hauling up
film crews to get a better shot of the scene.
   Thousands of people strolled the area, jamming the Pariser Platz
on the Eastern side.
   Under the Communist regime, East Germans were hauled in to the
police just for approaching the deserted square, while those on the
Western side looked on to the site from special bleachers.
   But for some, the joy of unification was tempered by
apprehension.
   ``There are a lot of negative things that will happen,'' said
Sylvia Reichenbach from East Berlin. ``And unemployment is in first
place among them.''
   The 26-year-old nurse said she still has her job, but her mother
will lose hers next week and her father most likely will be out of
work next year.
   ``I don't plan to come here tomorrow night. We're worried about
riots,'' said Ms. Reichenbach, holding onto her 3-year-old
daughter, Julia, as she tottered along one of the low walls in
front of the Reichstag.
   The Reichstag, the historic site of the German parliament, will
on Thursday play host to the first meeting of the joint parliament
comprised of German lawmakers from East and West.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Allow Nativity Display in Virginia Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to allow the
display of a Christmas nativity scene on the lawn of a county
government building in Charlottesville, Va.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that allowing a
private group to display the nativity scene, or creche, on public
property would violate the constitutionally required separation of
church and state.
   The Albemarle County Board of Supervisors approved a request by
the local chapter of the Jaycees to display the creche, and it was
set up on the front lawn of the county office building from Dec. 6,
1987, until Jan. 10, 1988.
   A group that included Unitarian ministers and a Jewish rabbi
sued the board in federal court over allowing the display.
   The county officials said the lawn is a public forum where many
public activities have been permitted, including a beauty pageant,
a United Way billboard, weddings and a civil rights demonstration.,
   The officials said the free-speech rights of the Jaycees would
be violated if the group were barred from displaying the creche.
The officials also noted that the creche was accompanied by a sign
that said it was sponsored by the Jaycees, not the county.
   A federal judge declared the display unconstitutional, and the
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling last February.
   ``The unmistakable message conveyed is one of government
endorsement of religion,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1989 Supreme Court ruling
that said a nativity scene standing alone inside a government
building in Pittsburgh was unconstitutional.
   The justices that same day allowed a Jewish Hanukkah menorah to
be displayed outside a Pittsburgh government building a block away
because it was accompanied by some secular, or non-religious,
items.
   The rulings last year were the high court's latest
pronouncements on what has become a familiar issue for the
justices.
   But the Pittsburgh decisions left unclear whether either
building there was a public forum where individuals or groups
traditionally exercise freedom of expression.
   The court split, 4-4, in 1985 in forcing the affluent New York
City suburb of Scarsdale to permit a private group's nativity scene
in a village park where non-religious displays were allowed.
   The Albemarle County officials said the lawn in front of the
county building is a recognized public forum just as that Scarsdale
park was.
   The Charlottesville case was clouded by the absence of the
Jaycees as a party to the dispute. In effect, the county officials
defended the free-speech rights of the Jaycees.
   The case is County of Albemarle vs. Smith, 89-2010.

   Argentine President Carlos Menem said today that
Iraq's Saddam Hussein ``has to be stopped,'' but declined to say
whether he was prepared to send Argentine forces into battle to
force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   President Bush conferred separately this morning with Menem and
Uruguay President Luis Alberto Lacalle, thanking both Latin leaders
for their solidarity in the international stand against Iraq for
invading Kuwait.
   Menem also assured Bush that he has ``completely deactivated'' a
secret Condor missile development program that past Argentine
military governments had pursued.
   The United States has feared that the program could make it
easier for hostile regimes in Libya and elsewhere to get their
hands on such medium-range missiles.
   Menem, questioned about whether he was prepared to commit his
forces to fight against Iraq, said, ``We have sent this group of
professional officers ... to consolidate and give support to the
embargo that was decided upon by the U.N.''
   But, ``I cannot give you an opinion on something that has not
yet happened,'' he said.
   Did Bush give Menem the impression that war was likely?
   ``No, no, no,'' said Menem, adding that they did not discuss
``the possibility of war.'' But, he said, ``we have agreed that
Iraq's president has to be stopped.''
   Menem recently dispatched two warships to the Persian Gulf,
becoming the first and so far only Latin leader to commit forces to
the international armada.
   Bush called Menem ``courageous,'' and said, ``The United States
is very grateful to you,'' not just for his stand in the gulf
crisis but his economic reforms as well.
   Lacalle told Bush that Uruguay has been ``really hurt'' by
honoring the sanctions.
   ``We had $30 million of meat, mutton, ready to be sent'' to Iraq
under recently negotiated contracts, he said. ``It's two punches:
the oil and the cutting of those contracts.''
   Uruguay is asking the United Nations for some of the
international aid that will be distributed to third countries that
bear the brunt of the effort to isolate Iraq.
   ``Uruguay is a country that has paid a serious price for
complying with the sanctions,'' Assistant Secretary of State
Bernard Aronson said afterwards. ``We would hope that their claim
would be looked on sympathetically and seriously.''
   On the Condor missiles, Aronson said Menem told Bush it had been
``completely deactivated.''
   ``We certainly take Menem at his word,'' said the State
Department official. ``That's a major step in reducing the threat
of missile proliferation.
   Menem also said he is cooperating with Brazil on efforts to
assure safeguards in the Latin countries' nuclear programs.
   Bush and the Latin leaders also discussed efforts to forge a
common market of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and their
desire to see the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade produce a
breakthrough on lowering trade barriers around the world.
   Bush told Menem the United States shares Argentina's concerns
about the agricultural subsidies that the European community
provides its farmers, Aronson said.

<TEXT>
   The state's Department of Archives and
History is opening up windows to the past by offering the public a
way to trace the roots of former slaves.
   The department is establishing a computer index of the first
labor contracts that one-time slaves in Mississippi entered into as
free people in 1865 and 1866.
   ``We plan to make the information available to the public in
February,'' said H.T. Holmes, director of the department's library
division. The computer searches would be free.
   Librarians would guide families through thousands of labor
contracts kept by the Freedmen's Bureau, formed by Congress after
the Civil War to ensure former slaves were treated fairly, Holmes
said.
   The contracts detailed the former slaves' names, where they were
working, their bosses, terms of their pay, and, in some instances,
their general health.
   The Washington-based documents are extensively used, said Judy
Thorne, a consultant at the National Archives.
   ``A lot of people who are doing Southern history are interested
in them. A lot of people interested in Afro-American history use
them and a few military historians are interested in them because
the military was running the project,'' Thorne said.
   The Freedmen's Bureau supervised abandoned or confiscated land,
issued rations of clothing and medicine, established hospitals,
monitored working conditions, recorded new and old marriages and
set up schools.
   Mississippi had 436,631 slaves in 1860 out of a total population
of 791,305, according to the Mississippi Statistical Summary of
Population for 1860.

   The Supreme Court said today it will try to
clarify what authority police have to pursue and detain people who
run away after seeing police.
   The justices agreed to consider reinstating the cocaine
conviction and 68-month sentence of an Oakland, Calif., youth who a
state court said was chased and caught unlawfully by police.
   California Attorney General John Van De Kamp argues that the
state court ruling limits too severely police authority in such
situations.
   Two members of the Oakland Police Department's drug task force
were on patrol April 18, 1988, when they saw four young men
standing by a parked car. The youths saw the officers when the
patrol car was about 40 yards from them. They immediately ran away,
and the parked car sped off.
   The officers, who said they suspected they had interrupted a
drug transaction, decided to give chase. Officer Jerry Pertoso took
a course that resulted in his running straight into a youth
identified as Hodari D.
   Initially looking over his shoulder, the youth did not see the
officer until they were about 10 feet apart. Pertoso testified that
the youth then threw away what turned out to be a rock of cocaine.
   Pertoso stopped Hodari D., forced him to the ground and
handcuffed him. The officer then retrieved the cocaine.
   Hodari D. was found to have possessed cocaine by a juvenile
court judge who ordered him placed in an appropriate county
facility for five years and eight months.
   A state appeals court, however, overturned the youth's
conviction.
   The appeals court ruled that the police chase, undertaken
without a reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed,
amounted to an unlawful detention.
   The appeals court also ruled that Hodari D.'s abandonment of the
cocaine rock was a direct result of the unlawful detention - so the
drug should not have been used as evidence against him.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment generally requires police to
obtain a court warrant before conducting searches or making
arrests. Courts have allowed some warrantless searches and arrests,
but only when police do not have time to get a warrant and have
probable cause or a reasonable suspicion to suspect a crime.
   The California Supreme Court refused to hear the state's appeal
last March 15.
   In the appeal acted on today, Van De Kamp argued that a police
chase never can be a detention.
   ``When a citizen exercises his constitutional right to leave the
vicinity of a police officer, the former is not detained until the
latter has forcibly restrained him,'' the attorney general said.
   In deciding a Michigan case in 1988, the nation's highest court
said officers sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the
sight of them even if they have no reason to suspect criminal
conduct.
   But the court left undecided whether police pursuit ever could
amount to a seizure.
   The case is California vs. Hodari D., 89-1632.

   University of the District of Columbia
officials said today that the embattled school is now open, but
some 400 protesters urged students to continue a boycott that
halted classes for three days last week.
   ``At this time, compromise is not in our vocabulary,'' said Mark
Thompson, a leader of the protest. ``It is ludicrous for the board
not to do what we are asking them to do.''
   Students barricaded themselves in a university building last
Wednesday and refused to leave unless 11 mayoral appointees to the
board of trustees agreed to immediately resign.
   Interim University President Miles Fisher said staff and
administrators were reporting to school today at their regular
times. A meeting between students and administrators was scheduled
today, along with two student rallies.
   Hundreds of students gathered outside campus buildings today,
still calling for the resignations of the board members appointed
by Mayor Marion Barry. The resignations would take effect March 31.
   Protesters claim board members have lost touch with students and
allowed the quality of the 12,000-student university's academic
programs to decline.
   Students also are upset at plans to renovate a building to
display the controversial feminist artwork ``The Dinner Party.''
The renovations, a condition of acquiring the work, would cost the
financially-strapped school $1.6 million.
   Trustee Roger Wilkins, a veteran civil rights activist, said
school officials had agreed to reconsider that decision and had
come to terms with students on about 40 demands.
   ``The negotiation sessions have been civil and very
professional,'' he said Sunday. ``They have been marked, in my
judgment, by a mutual desire, a very strong desire on each side, to
improve this university and to heal it.''
   Wilkins said two board members resigned voluntarily for personal
reasons, though others on the 15-member panel refused to do so.
   The trustees, nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the City
Council, cannot be forced to resign without cause.
   The school's faculty senate and several city officials have
voiced support of the students.
   City Council members have attempted to get past stalemated
negotiations by offering to consider expanding the board to 21
members. Trustees have offered to support the idea.
   Wilkins said demands to which the board has agreed include
assuming control of the school's cafeteria, providing day-care
facilities and establishing a formal grievance procedure to resolve
student complaints.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Extortion Case from West Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an
appeal by a former West Virginia legislator convicted of extorting
money from a group of foreign-trained doctors and not reporting it
as taxable income.
   The court said it will consider overturning a $50,000 fine and
three-year suspended prison sentence and probation for Robert L.
McCormick, a former member of the West Virginia House of Delegates.
   McCormick, who represented an economically depressed coal-mining
region suffering from a shortage of doctors, was a longtime
supporter of legislation allowing foreign-trained physicians to
practice in under-served areas of the state without meeting full
licensing requirements.
   Federal prosecutors said that in 1984 McCormick told John
Vandergrift, a lobbyist for the doctors, that his reelection
campaign was expensive and that he had not ``heard from'' the
physicians.
   Vandergrift then delivered an envelope to McCormick containing
nine $100 bills from Dr. Ernesto Manual, head of the group, called
the Coalfield Health Care Association. Prosecutors said McCormick
received additional cash payments, bringing the total to $4,300.
   McCormick sponsored legislation in 1985 to give permanent
medical licenses to experienced foreign-trained doctors who failed
to get passing grades on licensing exams. The doctors had been
practicing with temporary permits.
   McCormick was convicted of extorting $900 from the doctors and
not reporting it as taxable income. The jury deadlocked on counts
of the indictment charging him with taking additional payoffs.
   The former lawmaker said the money was a campaign contribution
and said he did not report it to the Internal Revenue Service
because the cash reimbursed him for expenses.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding the
conviction in February, ruled there was substantial evidence for
the jury to conclude McCormick was guilty of extortion.
   The appeals court said it is not necessary to show there is a
``quid pro quo'' exchange of money for government favors to prove a
violation of the federal Hobbs Act outlawing extortion.
   ``Such a quid pro quo may be present in an extortion. But as
long as the use of official power is the basis for the extortion,
then it is not an essential element of the crime,'' the appeals
court said.
   The appeals court also noted that West Virginia law forbids cash
campaign contribution of more than $50.
   McCormick's acceptance of money in violation of state law is
additional evidence of extortion, the appeals court said.
   It also rejected McCormick's argument that the money was not
taxable personal income but reimbursement for campaign expenses.
The jury had ample evidence to conclude the $900 was not a
legitimate campaign contribution and therefore to decide it was
taxable, the appeals court said.
   The case is McCormick vs. U.S., 89-1918.

<HEAD>Court Affirms Ban On Government Employees' Political Activity</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the federal law barring some state and local government
employees from being political candidates.
   The court, without comment, let stand Connecticut's loss of
about $150,000 in federal welfare money because two welfare workers
ran for office.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Connecticut argued
that the federal law, known as the Hatch Act, violates the
constitutionally protected right of political association and
tramples state sovereignty.
   A federal trial judge and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected those arguments previously.
   The Hatch Act limits not only the political activities of
federal employees but also those of state and local government
workers employed by agencies that receive federal loans or grants.
   The act bars federal employees from taking ``an active part in
political management or in political campaigns.'' It originally
imposed such a ban for some state and local government workers but
was narrowed so that now only political candidacy is barred for
them.
   In 1985, Wayne Camillieri worked for the Connecticut Department
of Human Resources in a position involved with federally funded
programs. Camillieri since 1983 had been a member of the Hartford
City Council.
   The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board in mid-1985 informed
Camillieri that the Hatch Act prohibited him from seeking
re-election to the city council if he remained in his state
government job.
   Camillieri nevertheless ran for re-election. He was defeated in
the Democratic primary.
   The board subsequently ordered the state agency to remove
Camillieri from his position, warning that failure to do so within
30 days would result in the withholding of federal loans and grants
equal to two years pay for Camillieri.
   The state agency refused to remove him, and $90,150 in federal
funds were withheld.
   Jack Winkleman also was an employee of the Connecticut
Department of Human Resources involved in federally funded programs
when in 1986 he was endorsed by the Republican Party as a candidate
for probate judge.
   Winkleman ran for the office while holding his state agency job,
but he was defeated in the general election.
   The federal board later ordered that Winkleman be removed from
his job, threatening to withhold federal money equal to two years
of his pay if he were not within 30 days.
   The agency balked, and $60,896 in federal money was withheld.
   State officials sought review in federal court, but the
withholding of funds was upheld by U.S. District Judge Jose
Cabranes.
   Citing past Supreme Court rulings, Cabranes said,
``Infringements upon the ability of government employees, be they
federal or state, to be candidates for elective office do not
violate the First Amendment.''
   He also rejected arguments that the federal government's action
against the state violated the 10th Amendment's granting of state
sovereignty.
   The appeals court upheld Cabranes' ruling in a brief order last
January.
   State officials then sought help from the nation's highest
court.
   The case is Connecticut vs. U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board,
89-1582.

<TEXT>
   A former San Jose City Council member who won,
and then lost, a $1.01 million libel award against his local
newspaper lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that Claude
Fletcher failed to prove the San Jose Mercury News in California
published statements about him with ``actual malice'' - knowledge
or reckless disregard of their falsity.
   Fletcher sued the Mercury News over a series of 1984 articles
reporting on his conduct while a city council member and as a board
member of a local antipoverty agency.
   Fletcher's 1984 bid for re-election failed after the articles
were published. The articles reported that five agency officials
said Fletcher tried to steer a $1.6 million contract to an
insulation business in which he became a partner.
   The articles quoted the agency's executive director as saying
that Fletcher once offered him and his wife a trip to Hawaii, which
the agency official interpreted as a bribe.
   A jury in 1986 awarded Fletcher $250,000 in general damages,
$25,000 in special damages and $735,000 in punitive damages.
   But the trial judge threw out the award, ruling that Fletcher
had failed to prove the articles were published with actual malice
- a burden facing any public official who sues for libel.
   Private citizens who sue for libel need only prove that an
allegedly libelous statement was false and made negligently.
   A state appeals court upheld the dismissal of the award, and the
California Supreme Court refused to hear Fletcher's appeal last
February.
   In its 1989 ruling, the appeals court said, ``The evidence
suggests a sincere attempt to report what the Mercury News viewed
as unethical behavior on the part of a San Jose public official.''
   It added, ``Clearly the articles contained factual errors. But
was there clear and convincing evidence that (the paper's reporter)
did not believe his story was true? We do not think so.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Fletcher said the articles about
him represented ``highly unreasonable conduct constituting an
extreme departure from ordinary standards of investigation and
reporting.''
   He said there was sufficient evidence of actual malice.
   The case is Fletcher vs. San Jose Mercury News, 89-1788.

   Worried that the mayor's mind is
elsewhere, a Nashville car dealer has offered the city's chief
executive $75,000 to quit.
   But Mayor Bill Boner's answer will have to wait until he returns
from Hawaii where he reportedly has gone to marry an aspiring
country singer today.
   ``It is obvious to all of Nashville that Bill Boner is
distracted from his job,'' businessman Lee Beaman said Friday.
``Our city is suffering from the void in leadership. For the good
of the city, Bill Boner should resign so we can elect a mayor in a
special election and move our city forward.
   ``In order to make it easier for Mayor Boner to resign, I have
offered to pay the $75,000 in salary he would be giving up if he
resigns now.''
   Boner, 45, turned heads in Nashville when he announced his
engagement ot Traci Peel, 34. At the time, he was still married to
his third wife.
   Boner's exploits were chronicled far and wide after the
Nashville Banner published an interview with Peel in which she said
the mayor's passion could last seven hours.
   Bumper stickers quickly appeared in Nashville that said: ``Seven
hours for Traci, three years for Nashville.''
   Beaman, head of Beaman Automotive Group and an officer with the
Beaman Bottling Co., said he made the offer a month ago to two
longtime Boner supporters.
   Boner spokesman Rick Runyeon said he knew nothing of the offer.
   ``The mayor is certainly committed to fulfilling his term of
office, and also committed to resolving some critical issues in
this final year,'' Runyeon said.

<HEAD>Court Turns Down Appeal of Pennsylvania Man in Environmental Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned down the appeal
of a Pennsylvania man given the longest prison sentence and biggest
fine in U.S. history for any person convicted of an environmental
crime.
   The court, without comment, let stand the three-year prison term
and $200,000 fine John Pozsgai of Morrisville, Pa., received for
violating the Clean Water Act.
   Pozsgai's lawyers told the justices his punishment was unfairly
severe for ``what was essentially a regulatory offense.''
   ``There was no evidence that any wildlife or fishery habitat was
harmed, or that water quality was impaired,'' Pozsgai's appeal
said.
   Yet his punishment included, the appeal said, ``the longest
unsuspended jail term imposed in the history of the United States
for any environmental crime, including the dumping of extremely
toxic and hazardous wastes and where people were even injured and
killed.''
   Pozsgai, 57, operates a truck-repair business from a garage
behind his house in the small town near Trenton, N.J. Across the
street from his house is a 14-acre lot that for years had been used
as a dumping site, mainly for thousands of old tires.
   A small stream ran through the lot, leaving at a point not far
from the Pennsylvania Canal.
   While Pozsgai in 1986 was negotiating to buy the lot,
engineering and environmental consultants told him the lot was
considered protected ``wetlands.'' Any development would have to be
approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pozsgai was told.
   He began filling a portion of the property even before
finalizing the purchase in June 1987.
   In April of that year, a Corps of Engineers inspector warned
Pozsgai that federal law barred him from continuing to deposit fill
on the land without first obtaining permits.
   According to court records, truckloads of fill continued to be
dumped on the land.
   In September 1987, Pozsgai was informed that the filling was a
violation of the Clean Water Act and was ordered to stop all such
activity. The filling continued.
   The federal government sued Pozsgai in the summer of 1988 and
obtained a court order directing him to immediately stop depositing
fill on the land.
   In a jury trial, Pozsgai was convicted on 40 counts of violating
the Clean Water Act. Asked by federal prosecutors to ``send a
message to all property owners,'' U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz
sentenced Pozsgai to three years in prison, five years of probation
and one year of supervised release. He also fined him $200,000.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction and
sentence last January.
   In the appeal acted on today, Pozsgai's lawyers argued that his
due-process rights had been violated at trial and that his
punishment was too stiff.
   ``Since the Justice Department has announced its intention to
use this case and others like it to bring a `reign of terror' upon
environmental violators, however minor the offense, this court
should ensure that the rules they play by are lawful ones,'' the
appeal said.
   The case is Pozsgai vs. U.S., 89-1735.

<HEAD>Court Turns Down Appeal of Former CIA Operative</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Frank Snepp, the ex-CIA operative turned
author, lost a Supreme Court appeal today in his fight with the spy
agency over getting prepublication clearance for some of his work.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that put the
burden on Snepp, not the CIA, to seek a court's help if
disagreements arise over what the agency is entitled to censor.
   Snepp worked for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1968 to
1976, working either in Vietnam or on Vietnam matters at CIA
headquarters in Langley, Va.
   In 1977, Snepp published a critical account of the final days of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The book, ``Decent Interval,'' was
published without first having been submitted for agency
preclearance.
   The Supreme Court in 1980 ruled that Snepp's publication of the
book was a breach of his employment contract with the CIA, and
ordered that he forfeit all proceeds from the book to the agency.
   The high court also ruled that the CIA could continue to require
Snepp to submit any agency-related writings for prepublication
approval.
   A footnote to the 1980 decision said allowing such preclearance
was not condoning censorship. ``If (Snepp), in compliance with
contract, had submitted his manuscript for review and the agency
had found it to contain sensitive material, presumably ... an
effort would have been made to eliminate harmful disclosures,'' the
court said.
   ``Absent agreement in this respect, the agency would have borne
the burden of seeking an injunction against publication,'' the
footnote said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Snepp said that 1980
footnote overturned what had been the CIA's policy of forcing
employees and ex-employees to go to court to challenge an agency
decision not to allow publication of certain material.
   Prior to the 1980 Supreme Court ruling in Snepp's case, the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that CIA employees and
ex-employees should have the responsibility for initiating court
fights when disputes arise over the agency's preclearance
procedures.
   The current dispute between Snepp and the CIA stems from his
submission for preclearance review in 1985 of a potential
television mini-series called ``Background: Lawcase Story.''
   After several rounds of negotiations, the CIA sought just one
deletion but by that time the television deal had fallen through.
   The 4th Circuit court last February rejected Snepp's contention
that the agency had been obligated to seek a court's help in its
effort to keep Snepp from publishing the submitted manuscript.
   The appeals court said the 1980 Supreme Court footnote did not
reverse its previous ruling absolving the CIA of the responsibility
of seeking judicial review.
   The case is Snepp vs. U.S., 89-1853.

<HEAD>Justices Allow Random Drug Testing of New York Jail Guards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today permitted the random
drug testing of New York City's 10,000 jail guards.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the guards'
labor union, which said the tests violate the officers' privacy
rights.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, upheld
the city Department of Corrections drug-testing program by a 4-3
vote in May.
   The city uses a computer to select 50 guards at random every two
weeks for urine tests.
   The state court said the city has a compelling interest in
requiring the tests and said the guards, who undergo other
inspections not required of ordinary citizens or other government
workers, have a diminished expectation of privacy.
   ``By choosing to work in the paramilitary milieu of the city
Corrections Department, guards voluntarily sacrifice certain
cherished freedoms,'' Judge Joseph Bellacosa wrote for the state
court. He noted that the guards already undergo drug tests - apart
from the random program they challenged - when they apply for jobs
and while they are on probation.
   The city also has a big stake in assuring the guards are drug
free, he said.
   ``The prevention, detection and resolution of the myriad daily
crises in this nether world demand the acutest sensory awareness,
undulled by the use of illicit drugs,'' Bellacosa said.
   Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, in a strongly worded dissent, said the
state court ruling made ``an important constitutional right the
latest casualty in the war on drugs.''
   Union officials for the guards said tests should be required
only of those the city has reason to believe are using drugs. The
union said the guards do not have direct responsibility for
protecting the safety of the general public and, because they work
in confined quarters, are less likely to be exposed to drugs.
   The union, noting the city's claim that 1.2 percent of tenured
guards and 2.9 percent of probationary officers use drugs, said
random testing is unwarranted when such a ``minute'' proportion of
the staff may be using drugs.
   The Supreme Court in 1989 upheld mandatory blood and urine tests
for railroad workers involved in accidents and for U.S. Customs
Service employees seeking drug-enforcement jobs.
   The high court has not ruled specifically on random tests for
government workers. But it repeatedly has denied, without comment,
appeals by such employees challenging random tests.
   Police officers in New York City also must undergo random drug
tests. They did not challenge the tests in court.
   New York state officials have not instituted such tests for
prison guards who have completed probation.
   The case is Seelig vs. Koehler, 90-48.

   A group of atheists challenging an oath for
potential trial jurors that includes the phrase ``So help me God''
lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings in a Texas case
that excluding atheists from jury service for refusing to take such
an oath does not violate their rights.
   The court also rejected the atheist group's challenge of Texas
courts' policy of asking potential jurors about their religion.
   Use of the juror oath and questionnaire, challenged by famed
atheist Madalyn O'Hair and her Austin-based Society of
Separationists, was upheld by a federal judge and the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   In its ruling last February, the appeals court said, ``The
occasion to serve on a jury in undeniably a duty, a privilege and
an opportunity for many citizens to actively and personally serve
their government ... Even so, jury service has not been construed
as a constitutionally protected right.''
   The appeals court also said that the ``So help me God'' phrase
in the juror's oath for Travis County, Texas, trials is merely a
solemn declaration of truthfulness, not an oath to a deity.
   About potential jurors being asked on information cards to state
their religious affiliation, including atheism, the appeals court
said, ``Atheism is indeed a relevant factor for the parties and
attorneys involved in the jury selection process - as much so as
whether a potential juror is a Baptist, a Presbyterian or a
Buddhist.''
   The case is Murray vs. Travis County District Court, 89-2018.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Policy Letting Banks Sell Insurance in Indiana
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a policy
that lets federally regulated banks sell insurance.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by insurance
industry lawyers who said the Federal Reserve Board policy could
lead banks into the same ``morass that has befallen the savings and
loan industry.''
   The cost to American taxpayers of bailing out the thrift
institutions recently was estimated at $500 billion, the insurance
officials reminded the court.
   The Independent Insurance Agents of America and other groups
challenged a 1989 Federal Reserve Board order permitting two
Indiana banks acquired by a bank holding company to sell insurance.
   The Fed said the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 does not bar
bank holding companies from acquiring bank subsidiaries engaged in
non-banking activities.
   The board acted after a congressional moratorium had been lifted
on non-banking activities by banks.
   Merchants National Corp., a bank holding company, was granted
permission by the Fed to acquire the Anderson Banking Co. and the
Mid State Bank of Hendricks County in Indiana.
   Anderson Bank has sold insurance since the bank opened for
business in 1916. Mid State purchased an insurance agency in 1985.
   ``The ability of bank holding companies to enter risky
businesses directly threatens to compromise the financial stability
of bank holding companies,'' insurance industry officials said in
their high court appeal.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in November that the
Fed did not exceed its authority in the Merchants National case.
   The case is Independent Insurance Agents of America vs. Federal
Reserve System, 89-1620.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
the murder conviction of Clarence Lee Brandley, a former high
school janitor set free this year after more than nine years on
death row in Texas.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that Brandley,
who is black, was denied a fair trial in the rape-murder of a
16-year-old white girl.
   The justices' rejection of an appeal by Texas officials appears
to put an end to the much-publicized case. Prosecutors said
previously they would not retry Brandley if the high court rejected
their appeal.
   The case generated widespread attention, with charges that
racially biased police officers concealed evidence, failed to
pursue leads and mistreated key witnesses.
   Brandley, 39, of Houston, once came within five days of being
executed. He now is studying to become an electrician.
   He was freed in January after the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals threw out his conviction for the Aug. 23, 1980, murder of
Cheryl Dee Fergeson. She was strangled after attending a volleyball
tournament at the Houston-area high school where Brandley worked as
a janitor.
   Brandley's first trial ended in a hung jury. An all-white jury
convicted him of capital murder in his second trial.
   Brandley's lawyers said he was the victim of racism, and Texas
courts lent support to charges he was accused falsely.
   A judge in 1987 recommended a third trial, citing discrimination
against Brandley.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said last December that
Brandley was the victim of ``blatant unfairness.''
   ``The violent end to Cheryl Fergeson's young life is both
senseless and tragic,'' the state court said. ``Our outrage over
her murder, however, cannot justify the subversion of justice that
took place during the investigation.''
   The state court noted that prosecutors relied heavily on
contradictory testimony by three other janitors, all of them white.
   Moreover, the state court said, Texas Ranger Wesley Styles, who
headed the investigation, failed to question the other janitors
separately when he conducted a ``walk through'' of the events of
the day of the murder.
   The state court noted that one of the janitors who testified
against Brandley later admitted he had lied, saying he was afraid
of Styles and one of the other janitors.
   The state court cited evidence ``the murder investigation was so
contrived that it created false testimony and ... failed to follow
any leads which did not comport with the preconceived, premature
notion that (Brandley) committed the murder.''
   District Attorney Peter Speers of Montgomery County, Texas, took
the appeal to the Supreme Court. State Attorney General Jim Mattox
refused to go along, saying Brandley's conviction was ``racially
tainted.''
   The case is Texas vs. Brandley, 89-1887.

   The Supreme Court today killed a 9-year-old
libel lawsuit stemming from two letters written to then-President
Reagan opposing a North Carolina man's appointment as a federal
prosecutor.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that dismssed the 1981 suit filed by David Smith of
Greensboro, N.C., against Robert McDonald, the operator of
child-care centers in Virginia.
   Smith was seeking nomination and appointment as a U.S. attorney
in North Carolina when McDonald wrote the letters opposing Smith.
   Copies of both letters, one mailed in late 1980 and one in early
1981, were sent to various members of Congress and Edwin Meese, who
guided Reagan's transition team.
   According to court documents, the letters accused Smith of
``violating the civil rights of various individuals'' while a state
judge, and charged him with ``extortion or blackmail'' and
``violations of professional ethics.''
   Smith's suit against McDonald went all the way to the nation's
highest court before it ever reached a trial.
   In 1985, the Supreme Court justices used the case to rule that
people may be sued over allegedly libelous statements made in
letters and petitions to government officials. The decision said
the First Amendment right to petition the government did not cloak
McDonald in absolute immunity from being sued over what he said
about Smith.
   The case then went to a federal jury, which awarded Smith
$200,000 in damages.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February threw out
that award after ruling that McDonald was entitled to absolute
immunity under North Carolina common law.
   In the appeal acted on today, Smith argued that the state's
common law provides only qualified - not absolute - immunity from
lawsuits in such circumstances.
   The case is Smith vs. McDonald, 89-1818.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that USX Corp. illegally discriminated against blacks at a Fairless
Hills, Pa., steel mill.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that a federal
appeals court ``flagrantly disregarded'' a 1989 Supreme Court
decision in ruling against the giant manufacturer.
   The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that USX, formerly known as U.S. Steel Corp., discriminated against
blacks who applied for non-skilled production and maintenance jobs
at the steel mill.
   The justices then ordered the appeals court to restudy that
ruling in light of their 1989 decision, called Wards Cove Packing
Co. vs. Antonio.
   In it, the high court made it far more difficult for workers to
win some job-bias lawsuits.
   The court's Wards Cove ruling was one of several 1989 decisions
Congress is seeking to overcome in a major civil rights bill
passed, in slightly differing versions, by both the House and
Senate.
   President Bush, saying he believes the legislation would force
employers to adopt racial quotas, has threatened to veto the bill
unless considerable changes are made before it reaches his desk.
   After re-examining the Fairless Hills case, the 3rd Circuit
court again ruled against USX.
   ``Although Wards Cove may have reduced the employer's burden of
showing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged
practices, we perceive no reason to disturb the district court's,
and our own, prior rejection of USX's assertion'' that its
practices were not discriminatory, the appeals court said.
   ``Although Wards Cove may have relaxed the employer's burden to
rebut the plaintiff's ... case, we do not read the decision as
requiring us to accept at face value an employer's explanations of
adverse impact of its hiring practices on blacks,'' the appeals
court added.
   A federal judge in 1983 ordered USX to end all discrimination in
the hiring of production and maintenance employees at the Fairless
Hills mill, and awarded more than $12.3 million to those
represented by a ``class action'' lawsuit.
   The judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between
the percentages of black applicants and black hires proved that USX
violated a federal anti-bias law, known as Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
   The appeals court upheld the judge's Title VII ruling but
ordered him to reconsider the monetary award in a way USX lawyers
said could raise the award to about $30 million.
   The Fairless Hills mill, where 7,000 to 10,000 workers are
employed at a given time, hired 5,516 people - including 977 blacks
- to production and maintenance jobs in the years 1971-82.
   In those years, blacks represented 25.9 percent of the
applicants and 17.6 percent of the hires.
   In the appeal acted on today, USX lawyers argued that the 3rd
Circuit court ``flagrantly disregarded (the justices') mandate by
giving Wards Cove only lip service.''
   ``The 3rd Circuit imposed on USX the burden of proving that
innocent factors, not race, caused the bottom line disparities,
rather than merely producing a reasonable business justification
for the specific employment practice at issue,'' the steel
company's appeal said.
   The case is USX vs. Green, 89-1816.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today
ordered the release of nine French nationals, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   The Frenchmen were among hundreds of Westerners believed held at
key military and other installations Saddam fears might be attacked
by the West.
   It was the second gesture by Iraq toward France in as many days.
On Sunday, Saddam complimented French President Francois Mitterrand
for offering ``positive'' ideas to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Iraqi agency, monitored in Nicosia said: ``President Saddam
Hussein has issued orders to allow some French guests to leave Iraq
in the company of Mr. Gilles Munier, the president of the
Association of Franco-Iraqi Friendship.''
   INA, the report added, ``has learned that nine Frenchmen are
included in this humanitarian gesture.''
   Foreigners, mainly Westerners, were banned from traveling after
the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent annexation
of the oil-rich emirate.
   As of late last month, 4,200 Westerners remained in Iraq and
Kuwait, including an undetermined number being held at Iraqi
military installations.
   In Sunday's message, Saddam softened his confrontational stand
in the gulf crisis, calling for replacing the language of ``threats
and warnings'' with a dialogue. However, he again linked any
solution to an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories.
   The United States has rejected that proposal, insisting on an
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   But Mitterrand, in a speech before the U.N. General Assembly
last week, stressed the need to resolve other issues, although he
demanded an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   He also suggested a simultaneous withdrawal of the Iraqis from
Kuwait and the U.S.-led multinational force from Saudi Arabia.
   In his message to Arabs and Moslems released by the official
media on Sunday, Saddam said he intended to initiate contact with
Paris. He said Mitterrand's ``initiative'' could be developed to
serve as a foundation for a settlement in the gulf.
   But Britain and France responded that there would be no dialogue
with Iraq until Saddam's troops are out of Kuwait.
   The Frenchmen to be released were identified by INA as: Bouban
Jean Ive, Frank Ouzeau, Gerard Wisat, Laurant Lucal, Christophe
Corrisier, Akbar Ali Ramadan, Din Mahmoud Taki, Hassan Ali Mansour
Husseun, and Dorneau Michel Henry Paul. The names were
transliterated from Arabic.

   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq says he
is ready for a dialogue with his international adversaries in the
Persian Gulf crisis, but he is still tying any settlement to other
conflicts in the region.
   His message Sunday, addressed to the Arab and Islamic msses,
represented a departure from previous, more bellicose declarations.
   He said he wanted to launch a dialogue with France to explore
the possibility of using President Francois Mitterrand's ideas on
the crisis as the basis for a settlement.
   Saddam urged his 1 million-member army to remain ready to fight
any foreign attempt to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait, which they
invaded Aug. 2. But - in another switch from past speeches - not
once in almost 45 minutes did he renew his pledge never to
relinquish the emirate he seized two months ago.
   Responding to Saddam's overture, France's foreign minister said
France and Iraq have not discussed opening negotiations.
   ``Any useful discussion can take place only if two conditions
have been fulfilled: the evacuation of Kuwait by Iraqi troops and
the release of all the hostages,'' Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
told the French radio network RTL on Sunday. As of late last month,
4,200 Westerners remained in Iraq and Kuwait, including an
undetermined number held at key Iraqi military installations.
   Britain, another leading member of the multinational military
force standing up to Saddam, also rejected his latest proposals.
   ``There is nothing new in this,'' a Foreign Office official said
on condition of anonymity.
   Saddam's message was read over state television and radio by
announcer Mikdad Murad and monitored in Nicosia. The backdrop
behind Murad alternated between a portrait of Saddam in a Western
suit and one of him in military uniform praying in front of a
picture of minarets.
   His message marked the birthday of the 7th-century Prophet
Mohammed and was punctuated by lengthy recitations from the Koran,
Islam's holy book.
   Saddam said reducing tensions could begin ``if dialogue replaces
the policy of threats and warnings, if the language of peaceful
politics replaces the policy of troop buildups and threats of the
use of force.''
   He withdrew his previous opposition to the involvement of
foreign powers in the search of a settlement to the dispute.
   ``Should the international community be involved in a solution
to the crisis, then the emphasis should be on the initiative of
Aug. 12, 1990, which underlined that ... peace could not be
achieved without the settlement of all the problems of the
region,'' he said.
   On Aug. 12, Saddam linked an Kuwaiti settlement to Israel's
withdrawal from the occupied territories. He has also tied it to a
Syrian pullout in Lebanon.
   In earlier statements, he has also rejected any outside
involvement, insisting the problem is for Arabs to resolve.
   Saddam said Sunday, ``Withdrawal of foreign forces from the
lands of Najd and Hejaz (Saudi Arabia) and the Arabian Gulf, and
ending the blockade of Iraq, is a slogan for all Arabs and
believers to raise.''
   But he did not repeat an earlier threat to dislodge these troops
from the region by force.
   In Mitterrand's speech before the U.N. General Assembly a week
ago, he suggested a serious drive toward settling the conflict over
Kuwait in concert with other problems in the region, including the
Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the Lebanese civil war.
   Mitterrand was the only Western leader to link the problems.
   The United States has rejected such a connection, setting off
Arab accusations that it is applying double standards in the Middle
East toward Iraq and Israel.
   Saddam said, ``We view the speech of the French president,
despite certain reservations, of being of a different language, and
we hope that our positive interpretation is correct. ...
   ``It is not important to agree or disagree with this initiative
or that, including that of French President Mitterrand.
   ``What is important that a serious dialogue be launched in
search of a possible, just and comprehensive solution that would
allow peace to prevail. ...''
   The Iraqi president said, ``We intend to launch contact with the
French government with the aim of formulating a precise viewpoint .
. . so that action could be launched on clear and solid
foundations.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Claims from Indians in South Dakota, Iowa,
Minnesota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today killed Sioux Indian
tribes' legal challenges stemming from their loss, through U.S.
treaties, of some 27 million acres of land stretching across three
states.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the tribes
waited too long to attack a 1972 plan by Congress for distributing
a $6 million settlement between the tribes and the federal
government.
   Under that plan, the tribes will receive three-fourths of the
money and 1,970 descendants who are not themselves tribal members
will receive one-fourth.
   The tribes contended in their 1987 lawsuit that they are
entitled to 100 percent of the $6 million settlement fund and the
interest it has earned since 1972.
   The dispute has its roots in treaties of 1830 and 1851 in which
the Sisseton and Wahpeton Sioux ceded to the United States vast
stretches of land in what now is South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota.
   The tribes sued the government about 100 years later, contending
that they had not received just compensation. The suit was settled
and Congress in 1968 appropriated the money to pay the settlement.
   Four years later, Congress devised the distribution plan but the
tribes did not challenge it in court until 1987, when the Bureau of
Indian Affairs indicated the 25 percent set aside for non-members
of the tribes was almost ready for distribution.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Hatfield in Montana threw out the suit,
ruling that the tribe had only six years to sue after Congress
unveiled the distribution plan.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last
February, and the tribes then sought help from the nation's highest
court.
   The case is Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux vs. U.S., 89-2015.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned down the appeal
of a Kentucky couple who say they were disqualified as adoptive
parents for a biracial child because they are white.
   The justices, withut comment, let stand state court rulings
that threw out Lisa and Ronald Wilson's civil rights lawsuit
against the Kentucky Cabinet for Human Resources and several of its
officials.
   The Wilsons contend that their race-based disqualification was
automatic. But state officials say the couple's race was taken into
account but was not the controlling factor.
   The state agency in August 1984 took legal custody of a
month-old child, Maria, who had been born to a white woman and a
black man. She was placed in a foster home with a woman known by
Lisa Wilson, then 24 and single.
   Lisa started taking Maria home with her every weekend, and then
four or five days each week. In August 1985, Lisa inquired about
adopting Maria.
   After a 1986 meeting with Cabinet for Human Resources employee
Brooke Darrow, Lisa received a letter telling her she and Ronald
Wilson, whom she planned to marry in early 1987, would not be
considered in selecting Maria's adoptive parents.
   ``If parental rights are terminated we will be requesting an
interracial adoptive family since (the child) is biracial,'ile, live in
an integrated neighborhood ... and live an
integrated lifestyle,'' he said.
   Two months before the Wilsons married, Maria was placed in the
home of an interracial couple who had been selected as prospective
adoptive parents.
   The Wilsons sued in state court, contending they had been
discriminated against.
   After a 1988 trial, a jury ruled against the Wilsons.
   The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last year, and
the Kentucky Supreme Court refused to review the Wilsons' ensuing
appeal.
   In the appeal acted on today, the Wilsons challenged what they
called the state agency's ``automatic race-matching of adoptive
parents and adopted children.''
   But state officials urged the justices to reject the appeal,
noting that the prospective adoptive parents with whom Maria was
placed had been approved more than a year before Lisa Wilson first
inquired about the possibility of adoption.
   The case is Wilson vs. Darrow, 90-123.

   Here is the text of prepared remarks by
President Bush to the United Nations General Assembly.
   Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General. Distinguished delegates to
the United Nations. It is a great privilege to greet you today as
we begin what marks a new and historic session of the General
Assembly.
   Forty-five years ago, while the fires of an epic war still raged
across two oceans and two continents, a small group of men and
women began a search for hope amid the ruins. They gathered in San
Francisco, stepping back from the haze and the horror to try to
shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream.
   Intensely idealistic, and yet tempered by war, they sought to
build a new kind of bridge, a bridge between nations, a bridge that
might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest
day.
   The founding of the United Nations embodied our deepest hopes
for a peaceful world. And during the past year, we have come closer
than ever before to realizing those hopes. We've seen a century
sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of
peace, cooperation and freedom.
   The Revolution of '89 swept the world almost with a life of its
own, carried by a new breeze of freedom that transformed the
political climate from Central Europe to Central America, and
touched almost every corner of the globe.
   That breeze has been sustained by a now almost universal
recognition of a simple, fundamental truth: the human spirit can't
be locked up forever. The truth is, people everywhere are motivated
in much the same way. And people everywhere want much the same
things: the chance to live a life of purpose - the chance to choose
a life - in which they and their children can learn, grow healthy,
worship freely and prosper through the work of their hands, their
hearts and their minds.
   We're not talking about the power of nations, but the power of
individuals. The power to choose, the power to risk, the power to
succeed.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch see some confidential documents in the
government's corruption investigation of Pentagoncontracts.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling that
the privacy rights of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the nation's largest
defense contractor, and some of its employees outweigh the public's
right to know more about the weapons procurement case.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear
arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   The Justice Department investigation, called ``Operation Ill
Wind,'' began in 1987 and has yielded more than three dozen guilty
pleas or convictions on fraud- and bribery-related charges.
   Among the contractors investigated was McDonnell Douglas, which
is based in the St. Louis area and receives some $9 billion a year
in Pentagon contracts.
   The FBI in 1988 conducted a search of defense contractor
offices, including those of McDonnell Douglas and its
vice-president Thomas Gunn. Search warrants were based on
information the FBI obtained listening to wiretapped telephone
conversations.
   The Post-Dispatch asked to see sealed documents related to the
warrants, particularly government affidavits that mi the
company and its employees ``weighs heavily in favor of the privacy
interests and non-disclosure.''
   ``These search warrant affidavits implicate some individuals
directly in criminal misconduct, others only indirectly,'' the
appeals court said. ``Disclosure could seriously damage their
reputations and careers.''
   Lawyers for The Post-Dispatch said the appeals court ruling
created ``novel rights of privacy that prevail over the First
Amendment interests of the public and the press.''
   The newspaper's appeal said the appeals court ruling ``held
without precedent that in pre-indictment situations privacy
concerns outweigh access ... even when, as here, the government
favors access.''
   The case is Pulitzer Publishing Co. vs. Certain Interested
Individuals, 89-1974.

<HEAD>Court to Decide if Jurors May Be Barred in Non-Criminal Cases
Because of Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether lawyers in non-criminal cases may bar potential jurors
because of their race.
   The justices said they will use the case of an injured black
construction worker in Louisiana to decide whether such racially
motivated exclusions are prohibited in 982, five years
after leaving the U.S. Marine Corps. In the interim five years, he
had served in the Marine Corps Ready Reserve, both as a member of
the Individual Ready Reserve and the Selected Marine Corps Reserve.
   All Ready Reserve members may be called to active duty in the
event of war or national emergency, but Individual Ready Reserve
members have no required training obligations.
   When Kolkhorst began his police job he was an IRR member, and
therefore had no drill or camp obligations.
   Since 1979, the 2,900-member Baltimore Police Department had
limited to 100 the number of police officers permitted to join an
active military reserve unit.
   The department's policy was motivated by two concerns:
   -Activation of local reserves during civil disturbances or other
emergencies would deplete the department's manpower to a point that
would jeopardize public safety.
   -Most reserve training takes place in summer months, when
vacation and other leave requests are at their highest.
   Kolkhorst subsequently joined a Selected Reserve unit and
received orders to report to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina in the
summer of 1986. When notified of those orders, the Police
Department told him to quit the active reserves immediately.
   He quit but sued, claiming the department had violated the
Veterans' Re-employment Rights Act.
   A federal judge last year ruled that Kolkhorst must be allowed
to join the active reserve unit, and ordered the police department
to pay him $4,164 in damages - the amount of income and benefits he
would have earned by participating in the reservist training.
   The 4th Circuit court upheld that ruling.
   The case is Tilghman vs. Kolkhorst, 89-1949.

   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration its views on a state court ruling that bars
communities from regulating the use of pesticides.
   The court asked Justice Department lawyers to comment on an
appeal by the rural town of Casey, Wis. The appeal had been
supported by state officials.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant
review to the town's appeal until hearing from the government
lawyers, which could take months.
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in March that local regulation
of pesticide use is pre-empted by the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972.
   Opponents of local regulation argue that towns and cities cannot
cope with ever-changing scientific advances and the complexities of
pest control. But local officials say they are the only ones
familiar with local conditions and hazards.
   The Wisconsin court said it did not weigh the merits of the
policy dispute, relying instead on Congress' intent in passing the
federal insecticide law.
   ``We conclude ... the pre-emptive action of the Congress
deprived the town of Casey of its police power to regulate
pesticides,'' the state court said.
   Officials in Casey, a town of some 400 people in Wisconsin's
northwest corner, required permits for pesticide use and aerial
spraying. The local law imposed fines of up to $5,000 for each
violation.
   The ordinance was challenged by a group that included farmers
and tree growers, and a state judge declared it invalid in 1986.
   The case is Wisconsin Public Intervenor vs. Mortier, 89-1905.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration for its views of a ruling that could help elect
blacks to a Florida county commission and school board.
   The court wants to know what Justice Department lawyers think
about an appeal by Liberty County, Fla., officials who said a lower
court went too far in seeking to protect the voting rights of the
county's black minority.
   The government's comments could take months to reach the
justices, who aren't expected to say until then whether they will
grant review to the Liberty County case.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April ruled in favor
of black voters challenging the at-large method of electing
commissioners and school board members in Liberty County.
   Blacks want members of the two bodies elected by district-wide
voting. One of the five county districts has a majority of
voting-age blacks, while blacks comprise only 11 percent of the
county population.
   A black never has been elected to the county commission or
school board, each with five members.
   The 11th Circuit court stopped short of eliminating county-wide
elections. But it sent the case back to a federal judge with
instructions that may lead to district-wide voting. The appeals
court's 10 members were evenly divided over exactly how to
implement its ruling.
   The decision relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court ruling that
made it easier for minorities to challenge redistricting plans that
may dilute their voting strength.
   The high court in that case struck down a North Carolina
legislative redistricting plan as a violation of the Voting Rights
Act.
   Congress in 1982 amended the 1965 voting rights law to eliminate
the need for minorities to prove intentional bias when challenging
districting plans. The new law requires only that minorities show
that districting plans have the effect of diluting their voting
strength, regardless of intent.
   In the Liberty County case, the 11th Circuit court said there is
sufficient evidence the black population is concentrated and
politically cohesive and that the vote is racially polarized.
   An opinion signed by five judges on the 11th Circuit said,
``Black voters have never had an opportunity to elect a black
representative, despite their manifest preference for those black
candidates that have presented themselves. Six futile elections is
enough.''
   A separate concurring opinion signed by five other judges on the
appeals court expressed reservations about their colleagues'
opinion. They said that opinion ``would create a right to
proportional representation for all large, compact and cohesive
minority groups.''
   The case is Liberty County vs. Solomon, 90-102.

   Let me also emphasize that all of us here at the U.N. hope
military forces will never have to be used. We seek a peaceful
outcome - a diplomatic outcome. And one more thing - in the
aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait, I truly
believe that there may be opportunities: For Iraq and Kuwait to
believe that there may be opportunities; For Iraq and Kuwait to
settle their differences permanently; for the states of the gulf
themselves to build new arrangements for stability; and for all the
states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that
divides the Arabs from Israel. But, the world's key task - now,
first and always - must be to demonstrate that aggression will not
be tolerated or rewarded.
   Through the U.N. Security Council, Iraq has been judged by a
jury of its peers - the very nations of the earth. Today, the
regime stands isolated and out of step with the times, separated
from the civilized world not by space, but by centuries.
   Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era, a
dark relic from a dark time. It has plundered Kuwait, terrorized
innocent citizens, and held even diplomats hostage. Iraq and its
leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and
destruction. But this outrageous disregard for basic human rights
does not come as a total surprise. Thousands of Iraqis have been
executed on political and religious grounds, and even more through
a genocidal, poison gas war waged against Iraq's own Kurdish
villagers.
   As a world community, we must act - not only to deter the use of
inhuman weapons like mustard and nerve gas - but to eliminate the
weapons entirely. That is why, one year ago, I came to the General
Assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from
the face of the earth.
   I promised the United States would destroy over 98 percent of
its stockpile in the first eight years of a chemical weapons ban
treaty, and 100 percent - all of them - in 10 years, if all nations
with chemical weapons capabilities sign the treaty.
   We've stood by those promises. In June, the U.S. and the Soviet
Union signed a landmark agreement to halt production, and to
destroy the vast majority of our stockpiles. Today, U.S. chemical
weapons are being destroyed.
   But time is running out. This is not a merely bilateral concern.
The gulf crisis proves how important it is to act together - and to
act now - to conclude an absolute, worldwide ban on these weapons.
We must also redouble our efforts to stem the spread of nuclear
weapons, biological weapons, and the ballistic missiles that can
rain destruction upon distant peoples.
   The United Nations can help bring about a new day, a day when
these kinds of terrible weapons - and the terrible despots who
would use them - are both a thing of the past. It is in our hands
to leave these dark machines behind, in the dark ages where they
belong, and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a
new world order and a long era of peace.
   We have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends
the Cold War. A partnership based on consultation, cooperation and
collective action, especially through international and regional
organizations. A partnership united by principle and the Rule of
Law, and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and
commitment. A partnership whose goals are to increase democracy,

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration whether state ``lemon laws'' should be allowed to
give buyers of chronically defective automobiles more legal
protection than they receive under federal law.
   The court invited Justice Department lawyers to comment on
arguments by domestic and foreign car makers that such state laws
impermissibly conflict with federal law.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant
review to the manufacturers' appeal until hearing from the
government, which could take months.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the car
makers when it upheld New York's lemon law last March.
   ``Congress did not intend to occupy the field of informal
dispute resolution mechanisms (and) it is possible to comply with
both the New York and federal schemes,'' the appeals court ruled in
giving car consumers a significant victory.
   Congress in 1975 passed the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, aimed at
giving consumers more information about the warranties provided on
the new cars they buy. The law does not require that a warranty be
provided, but requires that if one is given it not be misleading.
   The law also permits car manufacturers to require consumers with
complaints about the cars they bought to resort to some informal
type of dispute resolution, such as arbitration, before suing.
   The federal law was not successful in resolving consumer
problems with chronically defective cars, and many states responded
by assing their own lemon laws.
   The New York law, enacted in 1983, requires manufacturers to
give consumers full refunds or to replace defective cars if unable
to repair the same problem after four tries or if a car is out of
service for 30 days or more within the first two years or 18,000
miles of operation.
   The law was amended in 1986 to make any arbitration decision
binding on car manufacturers but not on consumers and to entitle
consumers to oral arbitration hearings.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and the Association
of International Automobile Manufacturers sued over the 1986
amendments. A federal judge ruled that the amendments are
pre-empted by the Magnuson-Moss Act, but the 2nd Circuit court
reversed that ruling.
   The case is Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association vs. Abrams,
89-2026.

<TEXT>
   And as we look to the future, the calendar offers up a
convenient milestone, a signpost by which to measure our progress
as a community of nations.
   The year 2000 marks a turning point, beginning not only the turn
of the decade, not only the turn of the century, but also the turn
of the millennium.
   And ten years from now, as the 55th Session of the General
Assembly begins, you will again find many of us in this hall, our
hair a bit more gray, perhaps a bit less spring in our walk. But
you will not find us with any less hope or idealism, or any less
confidence in the ultimate triumph of humankind.
   I see a world of open borders, open trade, and - most
importantly - open minds. A world that celebrates the common
heritage that belongs to all the world's people, taking pride not
just in hometown or homeland but in humanity itself.
   I see a world touched by a spirit like that of the Olympics:
Based not on competition that's driven by fear, but sought out of
joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence.
   I see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and
convert old foes, and where the Americas - North, Central and South
- can provide a model for the future for all humankind - the
world's first completely democratic hemisphere.
   And I see a world building on the emerging new model of European
unity. Not just Europe, but the whole world - ``whole and free.''
   This is precisely why the present aggression in the Gulf is a
menace not only to one region's security, but to the entire world's
vision of our future. It threatens to turn the dream of a new
international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy, in which the
law of the jungle supplants the law of nations.
   That is why the United Nations reacted with such historic unity
and resolve. And that is why this challenge is a test we cannot
afford to fail. I am confident we will prevail. Success, too, will
have lasting consequences - reinforcing civilized standards of
international conduct, setting a new precedent in international
cooperation, brightening the prospects for our vision of the
future.
   There are ten more years until the century is out. Ten more
years to put the struggles of the 20th Century permanently behind
us. Ten more years to help; launch a new partnership of nations.
And throughout those ten years - and beginning now - the U.N. has a
new and vital role in building towards that partnership. Last
year's General Assembly showed how we can make greater progress
towards a more pragmatic and successful U.N. And, for the first
time, the U.N. Security Council is beginning to work as it was
designed to work.
   Now is the time to set aside old debates, old procedures, old
controversies, and old resolutions. It's time to replace polemic
attacks with pragmatic action.
   We have shown that the U.N. can count on the collective strength
of the international community. We have shown that the U.N. can
rise to the challenge of aggression, as its founders hoped it
would. And now in this time of testing, we must also show that the
U.N. is the place to build international support and consensus for
meeting the other challenges we face.

   President Bush today condemned Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for
his invasion of Kuwait, but he also offered an opening to Baghdad,
suggesting that an Iraqi withdrawal could lead to settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Also today, Iraq ordered the release of nine French nationals in
its second conciliatory gesture in as many days. And in Israel, the
army said it will give out gas masks to every Israeli to protect
them in the event of a war.
   On Sunday, Saddam Hussein urged an international dialogue and
mentioned France as a possible partner. U.S., French and British
officials rejected the offer, saying they wouldn't talk until Iraq
withdraws from Kuwait.
   The nations allied against Iraq, meanwhile, were laying the
groundwork for possible military action.
   U.S. and Soviet officials were reported Sunday to be drafting
new U.N. resolutions that would authorize the use of force against
Iraq if the U.N.-ordered economic blockade fails to force Saddam
out of Kuwait.
   In his address to the U.N. General Assembly today, Bush mixed
harsh language against Saddam with an overture for a resolution of
the 2-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era, a
dark relic from a dark time,'' Bush said in his prepared remarks.
But he added: ``We seek a peaceful outcome, a diplomatic outcome.''
   ``In the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from
Kuwait, I truly believe that there may be opportunities,'' he said.
``For Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently; for
the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for
stability; and for all the states and peoples of the region to
settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.
   In past speeches, Saddam has linked an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait to an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories and a
Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. He repeated those conditions
Sunday.
   In other developments, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, met in
New York to discuss resuming diplomatic relations and ending a
2{-year rift, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said
today.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said in a dispatch from New
York that the meeting took place Sunday at U.N. heaquarters.
   It was the first time senior officials from the two countries
have met since the Saudis broke off ties in April 1988, citing
terrorism and subversion. It was the most positive sign yet that
they may be moving toward rapprochement.
   Thousands of French troops joined the U.S.-led multinational
force in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, and U.S. and British warships in
the Persian Gulf stopped and searched an Indian ship carrying
refugees from Kuwait. The refugee ship was not found to be in
violation of the U.N. embargo.
   European and Israeli military analysts said the likelihood of
war has grown significantly as sanctions and a hostile world push
Saddam into a corner with no diplomatic escape.
   ``I think another six to eight weeks is available to prevent a
conflict, but after that it becomes almost inevitable,'' said Paul
Beaver, publisher of the respected Jane's Defense Weekly, in an
interview in London.
   Such reports prompted the Israeli army to announce today that it
will begin distributing gas masks to Israel's 4.7 million citizens
next week.
   The announcement follows threats by Saddam to attack Israel,
including one in which he said he would burn half the Jewish state
with chemical weapons.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said today that Saddam has
ordered the release of nine French nationals. They are believed to
be among the Westerners Saddam has ordered placed at strategic
sites to serve as shields to prevent potential Western attacks.
   On Sunday, in a speech on Iraqi state TV and radio, Saddam said
he no longer opposes involvement by foreign powers in seeking a
settlement to the crisis, which was precipitated by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Saddam's speech, read by an announcer, said tensions can be
reduced ``if dialogue replaces the policy of threats and warnings,
if the language of peaceful politics replaces the policy of troop
buildups and threats of the use of force.''
   However, he again linked any solution to an Israeli pullout from
the occupied territories. And he said Iraq would defend Kuwait if
necessary.
   Saddam said he wanted to open a dialogue with France to explore
the possibility of using President Francois Mitterrand's ideas on
negotiating a broad Middle East peace as basis for a settlement.
   He said he viewed Mitterrand's proposals as ``being of a
different language'' than past foreign denunciations of Iraq,
adding: ``We hope our positive interpretation is correct.''
   In a U.N. speech on Sept. 24, Mitterrand suggested settling the
conflict over Kuwait together with other regional problems that
might include Israel's occupation of Arab territories and the
Lebanese civil war.
   But he also insisted that if Iraq wants to see foreign military
forces leave the region it must quit Kuwait and release the
estimated 2,200 Western hostages it holds.
   Responding to the overture, France, Britain and the United
States said they would not negotiate without an Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   ``It still doesn't address the two basic U.N. resolutions, which
are withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of the government,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

   Construction spending stalled in August
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait after posting its first gain in
four months in July, the government said Monday. Only an increase
in government projects kept overall spending from declining.
   ``Confidence is the major problem we have across-the-board right
now,'' said Daryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in
Newton, Mass. ``Confidence is certainly at the lowest point we've
seen in a long time.''
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government spending was virtually unchanged at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $442.5 billion following a revised 0.3
percent increase in July.
   The often-volatile government spending jumped 6.1 percent,
offsetting declines of 1.2 percent in residential construction and
4.3 percent in non-residential outlays.
   ``The residential sector was very weak,'' Delano said of the
$186.9 billion spending rate for single- and multi-family
buildings. ``It's consistent with everything we've seen in that
sector.''
   Residential spending has fallen for five straight months.
   Single-family spending was down 1.3 percent to an annual rate of
$108.5 billion following a 1.2 percent loss a month earlier.
Apartment construction was up 1.1 percent to $19 billion after a
0.5 percent gain in July.
   But non-residential spending, which advanced 4.2 percent in
July, fell 4.3 percent to annual rate of $104.8 billion in August
and more than erased the gain. Industrial spending, which jumped
16.2 percent in July, slipped back 12.7 percent.
   ``There's a lot more weakness to come,'' Delano said. ``It's
consistent with a lack of confidence and a wait-and-see attitude.''
   Government spending totaled an annual rate of $115.1 billion
following a 2.7 percent decline the previous month. Spending on
highways and streets led the advance with a 9.0 percent gain.
   The 0.3 percent increase in construction spending in July was
the first advance since a 0.4 percent gain in March. Spending fell
2.8 percent in April, 0.2 percent in May and 0.6 percent in June.
   In addition to consumer caution over the state of the economy
and the Persian Gulf crisis, analysts have attributed the general
weakness in the construction industry to high interest rates, tight
lending requirements, and, in some areas, overbuilding resulting in
high vacancies.
   The weakness has been illustrated in recent Labor Department
reports showing the loss of nearly 100,000 construction jobs in the
past three months. This included 40,000 jobs, after a seasonal
adjustment, in August, the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
   Construction spending in August was 2.0 percent above the $433.9
billion in the same month of 1989.

<HEAD>Court Asks Administration Comment on Hazardous-Shipment
Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration whether states should be allowed to regulate the
shipment of hazardous substances by railroads.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before deciding whether to review a ruling that such Ohio
regulations are pre-empted by federal laws governing rail safety.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will review
the Ohio case until hearing from the government lawyers, which
could take months.
   Ohio's appeal to the high court was supported by nine other
states, a nationwide alliance of state regulators and a railroad
union group. They urged the justices to overturn 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruling that invalidated Ohio's hazardous substance
controls.
   Leaving regulation of such shipments to the federal government
is an invitation to disaster, the state officials said.
   ``When rail hazardous materials accidents occur, the results can
be catastrophic,'' the officials said. They noted that billions of
tons of dangerous substances are transported each year and said
federal agencies lack the staffs or will to carry out adequate
inspections and enforcement.
   Supporting the Ohio appeal were Arizona, California, Louisiana,
Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. The
National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners,
representing officials in all 50 states, also urged the high court
to step in.
   The Railway Labor Executives Association, representing the
railroad unions, said the number of accidents involving trains
carrying hazardous material increased from 351 in 1987 to 517 last
year.
   The unions accused the Federal Railroad Administration of doing
little to correct the problem, leaving regulation to the railroads
themselves.
   The unions said that if the 6th Circuit ruling were to apply
nationwide ``all railroads that transport hazardous materials and
toxic substances can effectively avoid compliance with any and all
regulation.''
   The 6th Circuit court has jurisdiction in Ohio, Kentucky,
Michigan and Tennessee.
   The appeals court last April ruled in favor of four railroads
that challenged Ohio's regulations. The railroads are CSX
Transportation Inc., Conrail, Norfolk and Western, and Grand Trunk
Western.
   The appeals court said the Federal Railroad Safety Act strictly
limits the power of states to regulate rail safety. The aw
generally bars states from duplicating federal safety rules, the
appeals court said.
   But Ohio and the other states argued that a second federal law
specifically gives the states power to control shipments of
hazardous material by any form of transportation, including
railroads.
   Ohio officials said that law, the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act, established a dual system of federal-state
regulation. State rules must be consistent with federal regulations
under the law, the Ohio attorney general's office said.
   Ohio enacted its hazardous material control law after a 1986
accident in which 15 cars on a Baltimore &amp; Ohio train derailed in
Miamisburg, Ohio. A tank car containing phosphorous ruptured,
causing $3.5 million in property damage and prompting evacuation of
some 40,000 people.
   A report on the accident by the National Transportation Safety
Board said the Federal Railroad Administration had not exerted
sufficient control over tank car safety.
   The case is Public Utilities Commission of Ohio vs. CSX
Transportation Inc., 90-95.

   The Supreme Court opened its new term today by
agreeing to review its recent decisions barring sentencing juries
from considering the character of the defendant's victim or the
grief of the victim's family.
   There were only eight justices on the bench as the court issued
some 1,000 orders after returning from a three-month summer recess.
It denied review in the vast majority of the cases.
   David H. Souter is expected to receive Senate confirmation
Tuesday as the nation's 105th justice of the Supreme Court.
   In the sentencing case, the court agreed to consider reinstating
an Ohio man's death penalty for a love-triangle murder.
   In other action, the court:
   - Agreed to decide whether lawyers in non-criminal cases may bar
potential jurors because of their race.
   The justices said they will use the case of an injured black
construction worker in Louisiana to decide whether such racially
motivated exclusions are prohibited in civil as well as criminal
trials.
   - Rejected an appeal by an Ohio woman who gave birth to a
healthy boy after she underwent an unsuccessful abortion.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that barred the
woman from suing a doctor and hospital for the costs of rearing her
child.
   - Asked the Bush administration whether employers ever may bar
their workers from joining or serving in the military reserves.
   The court wants to hear Justice Department lawyers' views on a
ruling that struck down the Baltimore Police Department's policy of
limiting the number of employees allowed to be in active reserve
units.
   - Said it will try to clarify what authority police have to
pursue and detain people who run away after seeing police.
   The justices agreed to consider reinstating the cocaine
conviction and 68-month sentence of an Oakland, Calif., youth who a
state court said was chased and caught unlawfully by police.
   - Agreed to decide whether U.S. businesses are lawbreakers if
they discriminate against Americans they employ outside the
country.
   The justices, setting the case for an important ruling, said
they will decide whether Congress intended a major anti-bias law to
reach beyond the nation's borders.
   - Agreed to use a dispute over the settlement of a strike by
Continental Air Lines pilots to set new guidelines on the duties of
unions to represent their members.
   The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit against the
Air Line Pilots Association by striking pilots who said the union
denied them fair representation.
   - Permitted the random drug testing of New York City's 10,000
jail guards.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the guards'
labor union, which said the tests violate the corrections officers'
privacy rights.
   - Let stand a ruling that church-run schools must pay employees
the federal minimum wage and may not pay women teachers less than
men.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by officials of a
Baptist church in Virginia who said forcing the church to abide by
federal labor law violates its religious freedom and other
constitutional rights.
   - Rejected the appeal of three white men from New York City
convicted in the ``Howard Beach incident'' of 1986, a racially
motivated attack in which a black man died.
   The justices, without comment, let stand the manslaughter and
assault convictions of Jon Lester, Scott Kern and Jason Ladone.
Lawyers for the three men had argued they wrongly were limited in
excluding blacks as trial jurors.
   - Agreed to consider letting states outlaw all barroom-style
nude dancing as it voted to her an effort to reinstate such an
Indiana law.
   The court said it will review a ruling that ``non-obscene nude
dancing performed as entertainment is expression and as such is
entitled to limited protection under the (Constitution's) First
Amendment.''
   In the Ohio sentencing case, Ediberto Huertas fatally stabbed
Ralph Harris Jr. in Lorain, Ohio, on June 7, 1986. He now is
serving a life prison term for the crime.
   On leave from the Air Force, Harris was spending the night with
Elba Ortiz. Huertas, who had fathered two children with Ms. Ortiz,
allegedly warned Harris he would ``waste him'' if he continued to
see the woman.
   A state jury imposed the death sentence after hearing evidence
that Harris' parents wanted Huertas to die for his crime. Elizabeth
Harris, the victim's mother, also testified emotionally she was
proud of her churchgoing son and that his death had devastated his
son.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that such ``victim-impact''
evidence should not be considered by sentencing juries.
   And last year, the justices voted 5-4 that a jury generally may
not be told about the victim's character. The court said a South
Carolina murderer unfairly was sentenced to die because the jury
heard such testimony.
   That ruling was written by Justice William J. Brennan, who has
since retired.
   The four justices who dissented from last year's decision said
then they were ready to overturn the 1987 ruling and permit
victim-impact testimony in criminal sentencing.
   The Ohio Supreme Court relied on both U.S. Supreme Court rulings
when last May it reduced Huertas' death sentence to life in prison.
   Prosecutors argued that the jury should have been allowed to
consider the impact of Harris' murder on his family because Huertas
and Harris had been high school friends and Huertas knew the
family. The killer was aware of the impact his crime would have on
the family, they said.
   But the Ohio Supreme Court said such evidence is relevant to the
sentence only when the evidence has ``a connection to the
defendant's personal responsibility and moral guilt.''
   Otherwise, the state court said, such testimony undermines the
defendant's right to be sentenced by an impartial jury.
   The case is Ohio vs. Huertas, 89-1944.

<HEAD>Ousted Dallas Police Chief's Trial Transferred to Criminal Court</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state district judge ruled today that the ousted
Dallas police chief's perjury trial belongs in a lower court.
   State District Judge Joe Kendall transferred Mack Vines' trial
to Dallas County Criminal Court, saying his court lacks
jurisdiction because the perjury indictment does not allege
official misconduct.
   ``Nothing in the indictment in this case distinguishes the
charge in this case from that against any other member of the
general public,'' Kendall said.
   Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Ted Steinke said the
transfer to criminal court ``would have no bearing at all on the
case.''
   Steinke, who argued today that Kendall's court had jurisdiction
in the case, said the lack of mention of Vines' role as a public
official was not an omission in the indictment. But he refused
comment on whether it should have been included.
   ``This was the court's decision to make. We have no quarrel with
it,'' Steinke said.
   Vines' lawyer, Bill Boyd, praised the ruling.
   ``It's certainly not bad for (Vines) and it's good for him in
that we're clearly dealing with a misdemeanor,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, on the advice of my counsel, I am satisfied,''
Vines said. ``I guess we just go on from here to a misdemeanor
court.''
   State district courts have jurisdiction over felony charges,
while criminal courts handle misdemeanors.
   Steinke said the main difference is that six criminal court
jurors will hear the case as opposed to 12 in state court.
   Vines pleaded innocent Sept. 12 to the perjury charge. Hours
later, he was fired by City Manager Jan Hart.
   The misdemeanor charge alleges that Vines lied to a panel
investigating a police shooting about a conversation he had with
his assistant, Greg Holliday, Aug. 2. Vines has maintained his
innocence.
   Holliday said Vines called him late at night and tried to
influence Holliday's testimony before the special panel, which he
was scheduled to give the next day. Holliday told Ms. Hart of the
conversation and she suspended both men with pay. Holliday later
was reinstated.

prosecution of an alleged Honduran drug dealer who said U.S.
officials kidnapped and tortured him.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that the
defendant should be freed because U.S. officials violated
international law and the U.S. and Honduras constitutions.
   Only Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February refused to bar
prosecution of Juan Ramon Matta-Ballesteros, who faces drug charges
in Arizona and California and was sentenced in a federal court in
Florida to three years in prison for an earlier escape.
   Matta escaped from the Eglin Air Force Base prison in Florida in
1971 and fled to his native Honduras, which does not extradite its
own citizens.
   He was arrested by Honduran authorities at his home in
Tegucigalpa on April 5, 1988, and was turned over to U.S. marshals.
   Matta said the marshals, who took him to a federal prison in
Marion, Ill., beat him severely and burned him with a stun gun that
uses electric pulses to immobilize victims.
   U.S. officials denied those allegations and said any
mistreatment Matta suffered while in custody was the work of his
Honduran captors.
   Matta was transferred from Illinois to Florida, where he was
convicted of escaping from federal custody.
   The 7th Circuit court ruled that even if Matta's rights were
violated, he is not entitled to be freed.
   ``For the past 100 years, the Supreme Court has consistently
held that the manner in which a defendant is brought to trial does
not affect the ability of the government to try him,'' the appeals
court said.
   If Matta was mistreated, the appeals court said, his remedy is
to sue the government and the officials who allegedly violated his
rights.
   A related issue has been raised by the arrest of a Mexican
suspect in the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   A federal judge has ruled that U.S. officials violated an
extradition treaty with Mexico when they seized Dr. Humberto
Alvarez Machain, a gynecologist accused of administering drugs to
Camarena while the agent was tortured.
   Justice Department lawyers are appealing the judge's ruling.
   The Mexican government protested Alvarez's arrest, in contrast
to Matta's capture in which the Honduran government cooperated.
   The Supreme Court last February bolstered the fight against drug
smuggling and terrorism when it ruled that U.S. agents do not need
warrants to search in other countries. The court upheld the
warrantless search of the home of a suspected Mexican drug
smuggler.
   The case acted on today is Matta-Ballesteros v. Henman, 89-1797.

<HEAD>Impeached Ex-Judge Seeking Running In Florida Runoff</HEAD>

   Impeached former federal judge Alcee
Hastings is trying to make a comeback in public life, running for
Florida secretary of state with the same defiance he displayed
toward prosecutors and U.S. senators.
   Hastings faces ex-newspaperman Jim Minter for the Democratic
nomination for secretary of state in the only statewide race in
Tuesday's primary runoff election in Florida.
   ``A lot of people really do know that I took a political hatchet
in the face,'' Hastings says of his impeachment, which came despite
his acquittal in court on bribery charges. ``I will not be made
into some kind of clown.''
   The 53-year-old former judge, removed from office by the U.S.
Senate in 1989, finished second to Minter ina three-way primary
that also featured former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon John Paul
Rogers, who got more than a quarter of a million votes.
   Polls show Minter leading Hastings by 11 percentage points, but
more than a third of those questioned were undecided. Well-financed
Republican incumbent Jim Smith would beat either candidate in the
Nov. 6 general election, the polling data indicates.
   Low voter turnout for Tuesday's runoff could benefit Hastings,
who has picked up support from the state's labor unions and has a
strong base among minority voters in his Miami home. Dot Joyce,
director of the Division of Elections, predicted a ``miserable''
turnout Tuesday that might reach 20 percent if the weather is good.
   Hastings, who decided to run for secretary of state after a
brief campaign for governor, was Florida's first black federal
judge when appointed by President Carter in 1979.
   The Senate ousted Hastings from the federal bench for conspiring
to obtain a $150,000 payoff involving the alleged fixing of court
cases. A friend of Hastings', William Borders, was convicted of
bribery conspiracy in the case, but Hastings was acquitted in a
1983 jury trial.
   The impeachment proceeding ``gives new meaning to double
jeopardy and renders a severe blow to ... the jury system,''
Hastings declared after the Senate removed him from office 11
months ago.
   Minter, 52, resigned as an editorial writer and columnist for
the Tallahassee Democrat to seek his first political office. He
cites his experience as a speechwriter for former Gov. Reubin Askew
and as an aide to ex-Secretary of State George Firestone to show he
knows his way around the Capitol.
   Minter, who has picked up nearly every newspaper endorsement,
has directed his low-budget campaign toward those he calls ``good
government folks'' such as political activists and
environmentalists.
   ``It's going to be a very close race and it depends entirely on
the turnout,'' Minter said. ``If the good government folks don't
turn out, the Democrats are going to wind up with a strange
bedfellow.''
   Hastings bristles at the comment, pointing out that he is the
only candidate who was selected by a president for a federal
office. The ex-judge also said the state's newspaper editorial
boards haven't treated him fairly.
   ``They formed their judgments without even hearing from me,'' he
said. ``I will beat the living daylights out of every daily
newspaper and prove they cannot elect people.''
   Hastings has proposed abolishing the independently elected state
Cabinet as too cumbersome, even though he seeks a seat on it. And
he has suggested that legalized casino gambling might help solve
the state's budget problems.
   The secretary of state is Florida's top elections official and
oversees corporate charters and state records. Minter and Hastings
have called for campaign finance reform and both have outlined
positions on the environment, education and other issues that face
the Cabinet, which makes a wide range of executive decisions.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: we face.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The world remains a dangerous place. And our security and
well-being often depends, in part, on events occurring far away. We
need serious international cooperative efforts to make headway on
threats to the environment, on terrorism, on managing the debt
burden, on fighting the scourge of international drug trafficking,
and on refugee and peacekeeping efforts around the world.
   But the world also remains a hopeful place. Calls for democracy
and human rights are being reborn everywhere. These calls are an
expression of support for the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter.
They encourage our hopes for a more stable, more peaceful, more
prosperous world.
   Free elections are the foundation of democratic government, and
can produce dramatic successes, as we have seen in Namibia and
Nicaragua. And the time has come to structure the U.N. role in such
efforts more formally. And so today, I propose that the United
Nations establish a Special Coordinator for Electoral Assistance,
to be assisted by a U.N. Electoral Commission comprised of
distinguished experts from around the world.
   As with free elections, we also believe that universal U.N.
membership for all states is central to the future of this
organization, and to the new partnership we've discussed. In
support of this principle, and in conjunction with U.N. efforts to
reduce regional tensions, the United States fully supports U.N.
membership for the Republic of Korea. We do so without prejudice to
the ultimate objective of reunification of the Korean Peninsula,
and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
   Building on these and other initiatives, we must join together
in a new compact - all of us - to bring the United Nations into the
21st Century. And I call today for a major, long-term effort to do
this. We should build on the success of our distinguished secretary
general, my longtime friend and colleague, Javier Perez de Cuellar.
We should strive for greater effectiveness and efficiency of the
U.N.
   The United States is committed to playing its part, helping to
maintain global security, promoting democracy and prosperity. My
administration is fully committed to supporting the United Nations,
and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the
charter. International peace and security - and international
freedom and prosperity - require no less.
   The world must know and understand: From this hour, from this
day, from this hall - we step forth with a new sense of purpose, a
new sense of possibilities. We stand together, prepared to swim
upstream, to march uphill, to tackle the tough challenges as they
come - not only as the United Nations - but as the nations of the
world united.
   Let it be said of the final decade of the 20th Century: This was
a time when humankind came into its own. When we emerged from the
grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a
revolution of the spirit and of the mind, and began a journey into
a new day, a new age, and a new partnership of nations.
   The U.N. is now fulfilling its promise as the world's parliament
of peace. I congratulate you. I support you. and I wish you
Godspeed in the challenges ahead.

   Negotiators in Washington state reached a tentative agreement
today in the longest teachers' strike and New York City's
85,000-member union, the nation's largest, averted a walkout just
hours after its contract expired.
   In Everett, Wash., negotiators sat down at 1 p.m. Sunday and met
through the night with three state mediators until reaching an
agreement about 8:30 a.m. today, said Washington Education
Association spokesman John Cahill.
   The proposal was to be brought before teachers in the Mukilteo
School District for ratification this afternoon, Cahill said. He
declined to release details of the agreement until it was presented
to the district's 460 teachers. The Mukilteo strike began Aug. 30
and classes were to start Sept. 5. Key issues included class size,
teacher assignment and transfer policies, school decision-making
panels and pay for extra time, responsibility and incentives.
   In New York, the city and its teachers' union reached tentative
agreement today on a contract that would raise salaries 5.5
percent, both sides said.
   Union spokesman Bert Shanas said the two sides agreed on a
one-year contract, and a statement from the school chancellor's
office said the raise would bring starting salaries to $26,375 and
senior salaries to $52,750.
   The old contract, covering 65,000 public school teachers and
20,000 other school employees, expired at midnight. School was in
session today.
   Meanwhile, the nation's largest labor dispute involving teachers
continued in Louisiana. The strike by public school teachers
entered its third week today after union negotiators rejected what
Orleans Parish School Board officials said was a $13 million
contract.
   In New York, Neill Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the United
Federation of Teachers, said earlier that agreements were reached
on all non-economic issues, but the two sides were haggling over
the size of a pay raise.
   Last week, the union rejected the city's offer of a 4 percent
raise. Rosenfeld said the city raised that offer, but he would not
how high.
   Teachers in New York City make a starting salary of $25,000 and
can earn up to $50,000.
   The new contract will cover employees of about 1,000 elementary,
junior high and high schools that serve about 946,000 students. The
20,000 employees who are not teachers include counselors, social
workers and secretaries.

<HEAD>Court Will Consider Prisoners' Rights Case From Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether unfit prison living conditions may amount to cruel and
unusual punishment when there is no evidence officials acted
maliciously.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by an Ohio inmate who
accused officials of being indifferent to overcrowding,
rat-infested kitchens, freezing cold, oppressive heat and other
miserable conditions.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January threw out a
suit by Pearly Wilson, a prisoner in the Hocking Correctional
Facility in Nelsonville, Ohio.
   Wilson said prison officials violated the Eighth Amendment to
the Constitution, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment.
   He said the inmates were in cramped cells, subject to excessive
noise, foul lavatories and housed with the physically and mentally
ill. The prison is frigid in winter and stifling in summer, he
added.
   But the appeals court said Wilson did not demonstrate that
officials have engaged in ``persistent malicious cruelty.'' At
worst, the state is guilty of negligence and that does not prove
any constitutional violation in such circumstances, the appeals
court said.
   Wilson argued that evidence of deliberate indifference is enough
to warrant intervention by the federal courts to order states to
improve living conditions.
   He also said the 6th Circuit court ruling conflicts with
decisions by other federal appeals courts.
   Ohio officials, in urging the high court to reject Wilson's
appeal, said the inmate filed more that 70 lawsuits against the
state since 1976, almost all them frivolous or premature.
   The officials also said there is ample evidence the state tried
to improve conditions at the facility.
   The case is Wilson vs. Seiter, 89-7376.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments
Tuesday in a case that could define the federal judiciary's duties
and responsibilities after a school system is declared
desegregated.
   In the long run, up to 500 school districts nationwide could be
affected by the high court's decision, say lawyers for both sides
in the case. It's not known when the court will rule.
   The question before the court is whether the Oklahoma City
School Board's 1985 decision to abandon forced busing will lead the
district away from a desegregated or ``unitary'' system.
   U.S. District Judge Luther Bohanon ruled in 1985 that the
federal court could not intervene to stop the board's neighborhood
school plan, which abandoned forced busing for students in
kindergarten through fourth grades. Students in upper grades are
still bused.
   Bohanon reasoned that since he had declared the Oklahoma City
district desegregated in 1977, the federal courts no longer had
jurisdiction.
   The NAACP appealed and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed Bohanon. The school district appealed to the Supreme
Court.
   The 10th Circuit said federal court supervision in such cases
``extends beyond the termination of the wrongdoing.'' It said the
Oklahoma City School Board had a continuing duty to refrain from
any action that would weaken racial balance in the public schools,
and ordered Bohanon to study ``alternatives to maintain racially
balanced elementary schools.''
   School Superintendent Arthur Stellar maintains that no
segregation results from the neighborhood school plan.
   Steller said there are no identifiably white schools left in the
district, but admits that 10 of the 58 elementary schools ``are 90
percent or more black.''
   He blamed that on the fact that ``the neighborhoods are not
entirely integrated.'' But, he added, ``if the present trends
continue, they would become more and more integrated.''
   ``I think ideally we would live in a world where schools,
churches and neighborhoods would all be integrated. Unfortunately,
that's not the situation in which we live,'' Steller said.
   Not everyone agrees the system is desegregated.
   ``We have 32 elementary schools in Oklahoma City that are
racially identifiable, and by racially identifiable I mean 90 to 98
percent one race or the other,'' said Roosevelt Milton, president
of the local chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Milton said the neighborhood plan has shortchanged blacks.
   ``I'd say essentially we're getting inexperienced educators and
a lack of adequate books and supplies, and I think relegating a
very high number of socio-economically deprived students into the
same school,'' he said.
   The case has spanned nearly three decades.
   In October 1961, A.L. Dowell, a black optometrist, filed a
lawsuit contending his son, Robert, was denied admission to a
predominantly white high school. He alleged a quota system was used
to keep black enrollment at predominantly white schools to a
minimum and that there was a double standard for the two races.
   Nearly two years later, Bohanon ordered the district to take
extensive steps to bring racial balance to the schools. In the
1972-73 school year, court-ordered busing began and thousands of
children were transported throughout a district where only 25.1
percent of the students were black and 74.9 percent were white.
   About 5,000 children rode school buses before Bohanon's 1972
busing order. That number jumped by 15,000 for the 1972-73 school
year, according to minutes from school board meetings.
   Many whites left the school district for the suburbs. From an
enrollment of 68,904 in 1971, the district dropped to 59,241 the
next year. It was down to only 37,735 pupils in the school year
just completed.
   White students were the minority last year, 44.7 percent of the
total enrollment. Black enrollment was up to 40 percent, while the
remaining 15.3 percent was listed as Spanish, American Indian or
Oriental.
   Six years after the forced busing began, Bohanon ruled that it
had achieved its objective. He declared the Oklahoma City School
District to be desegregated and ended court supervision.
   School officials continued the busing until the 1985-86 school
term, when the neighborhood school concept was implemented.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Force Kentucky to Open Juvenile Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to force
states to allow some public access to juvenile court hearings or
records.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Kentucky court rulings
that upheld the mandatory secrecy of the state's juvenile courts.
   Kentucky's policy was challenged in 1988 by The Courier-Journal
and Louisville Times after a newspaper reporter was forbidden to
see transcripts of a juvenile court hearing.
   The dispute arose over the case of a 16-year-old youth,
identified in court records by the initials F.T.P., who fatally
beat another juvenile who lived in the same state-run facility.
   After F.T.P. was charged, state prosecutors sought to have his
case transferred out of juvenile court so he could be tried as an
adult.
   In response, lawyers for F.T.P. asked a juvenile court judge to
declare the state's transfer law unconstitutional. The judge did
so.
   It was the hearing on the transfer law's constitutionality that
the Louisville newspapers sought to attend. They later sought to
obtain transcripts and records from the hearing.
   A trial judge ruled that the juvenile court proceedings must
remain secret, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld that ruling
last year.
   The Kentucky Supreme Court refused to hear the newspapers'
appeal last April.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the newspapers argued
that past rulings by the nation's highest court established ``a
presumption of openness in criminal trials and pretrial
proceedings.''
   ``There is simply no reason why proceedings which the
Constitution would require to be presumptively open if the accused
was an 18-year-old can be mandatorily closed when the accused is
17,'' the appeal said.
   ``Juvenile courts in Kentucky are not required, or even allowed,
to consider closure on a case-by-case basis, inquiring into the
existence and intensity of interests supporting closure,'' it
added.
   The case is Courier-Journal vs. F.T.P., 90-107.

   Americans re about evenly divided on the
question of how strong the U.S. military response should be if Iraq
attacks American forces in the Persian Gulf, according to a poll
released Monday.
   Of the 1,000 people surveyed, 49 percent said the United States
should respond with the limited force necessary for defense, while
47 percent said it should launch an all-out war. Four percent said
the United States shouldn't respond with force.
   But a majority - 69 percent - said the United States should give
the international economic sanctions against Iraq time to work
before considering war. Twenty percent said the United States
should not start war under any circumstances.
   The survey was commissioned by Americans Talk Security, a
bipartisan organization of pollsters who gauge attitudes to matters
of national security.
   Forty percent of those polled said U.S. forces should remain in
the gulf region a year or more; 22 percent said they should remain
``as long as it takes;'' and 6 percent said U.S. troops should
start leaving immediately.
   If U.S. forces start to leave, 66 percent of the respondents
said the United States should negotiate an agreement with Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf states to have a permanent deployment of
American troops in the region.
   In the event of a protracted stalemate with Iraq, 73 percent
said the United States should launch a massive, all-out war and 19
percent said the United States should use nuclear weapons in such a
case. Ten percent said the United States should use chemical
weapons; 56 percent said it should not.
   But 56 percent said a stalemate was unlikely or impossible,
while 40 percent said it was likely.
   Asked what the United States could have done to avert the
crisis, 21 percent said there should have been increased research
and development of energy sources other than oil and 18 percent
said the United States shouldn't have helped Iraq in its eight-year
war with Iran.
   The respondents were asked to rate the top U.S. priorities in
the gulf confrontation.
   Producing a lasting peace in the Middle East was first followed
by removing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power and the free
flow of oil from the Mideast. At the bottom of the list was
returning Kuwait's royal family to power.
   Interviews for the survey were conducted between Sept. 21 and
26. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percent.

<TEXT>
   Father Sergio Giuramondo's quest for inner peace
provides the drama on screen in the Taviani brothers' ``Night
Sun.'' Off screen, finding the actor to play Father Sergio was an
equally difficult task.
   ``We had an image in our head and we couldn't find someone in
Italy or in France,'' said Paulo Taviani in a press conference with
brother Vittorio after the film's recent screening at the New York
Film Festival. ``One day, we saw a picture of (English actor)
Julian Sands, and just from his face, his body, we thought he would
be right.
   ``We met with him for a long time. We had him read parts from
other films of ours. It was a little difficult at first not to have
an actor who's Italian, but it's happened many, many times. Perhaps
because we belong to an underdeveloped country that has to borrow
bits of culture from others,'' joked Paulo, whose previous films
with Vittorio include ``The Night of San Lorenzo'' and ``Good
Morning Babylon.''
   ``Night Sun'' is based on ``Father Sergio,'' a short novel by
Leo Tolstoy, and takes place in 18th-century Naples. The original
story was based in 19th- century St. Petersburg.
   As a boy, the intense Sergio wishes to serve his King and
eventually receives his wish. But the King pushes him into a
disastrous engagement with the beautiful Cristina (Nastassja
Kinski), who reveals that for a year she was the monarch's
mistress.
   An enraged Sergio storms out of her home and decides to become a
monk. The monastery also proves unsatisfactory (too close to the
temptations of the secular world), and Sergio chooses to become a
hermit.
   Even then, his will is tested. He is twice visited by women who
desire him sexually and receives unwanted fame when villagers
believe he is responsible for making a dumb boy speak. The film
ends with Sergio wandering from village to village.
   ``The film centers on the predicament of one's desire for
privacy and one's desire to interact with others,'' explained
Vittorio Taviani.
   ``A constant was a desire to tell a beautiful story,'' added
Paulo. ``The most important stories, such as `The Iliad,' often
have a journey as their theme.''
   ``Night Sun'' runs for 112 minutes and does not have an American
distributor.
   The New York Film Festival opened Sept. 21 with ``Miller's
Crossing'' and closes Oct. 7 with ``The Nasty Girl.''

   A man fatally shot his estranged wife and
2-year-old daughter, and their two dogs, before putting the gun to
his own head and killing himself, police said.
   ``There was a Bible over the little girl's chest, right over the
gunshot wound,'' said Shelby County Coroner Billy Thompson.
   Police said Herbert Kim Deneau, 37, killed his daughter, Julia
Deneau, and his wife, Judy Ann Watson, 37, along with the family's
two collies.
   Officers said Deneau called a friend Sunday and reported the
slayings. The friend alerted police.
   All of the victims, including the dogs, were found in a walk-in
closet off an upstairs bedroom, authorities said.
   The Birmingham Post-Herald quoted unidentified neighbors as
saying that Deneau and his wife separated about a month ago and
were going through a divorce. They said Deneau continued living in
the house after his wife, who used her maiden name, moved out.
   Police Sgt. J.B. Thrasher said there was almost no furniture in
the house in the well-to-do Birmingham suburb because Ms. Watson
had taken it with her.
   Neighbors told the Post-Herald that Deneau was a stockbroker who
had been unemployed for more than a year and that he was intensely
private, posting ``no trespassing'' signs to keep people away from
his yard.
   `I was sort of afraid of him,'' one neighbor told the newspaper.
``I thought that he could do something like this. Whenever my
husband was away, I stayed inside.''

   A man has been accused of stealing an
airplane and buzzing downtown highrise buildings before crashing
into a wooded area.
   Jeffrey Campbell, 33, faced charges of theft, burglary and
criminal mischief.
   The single-engine Cessna 172 was stolen early Sunday from
Anchorage Air Center at Merrill Field, said Police Sgt. Gary Lee.
The pilot then flew it between the Arco and Hunt office building
towers, circled the Sheraton Anchorage Hotel a few times and
slipped between the towers of the Hotel Captain Cook.
   ``He did a few very erratic maneuvers,'' Lee said. ``Then he
disappeared.''
   The plane crashed on a firing range at Fort Richardson, but the
pilot managed to walk away and call a cab to take him home, Lee
said.
   Campbell, an unemployed cab driver, was arrested later in the
day, examined at a hospital and taken to jail, Lee added.

<TEXT>
   Iran and Syria have agreed on a plan to
free Western hostages in Lebanon, a Beirut newspaper reported
today.
   Also today, the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army said it freed
40 Shiite Moslem detainees to mark the birthday of the Prophet
Mohammed. The demands of the Shiites holding most of the 13
Westerners missing in Lebanon include the release of the 340
Moslems held by the South Lebanon Army.
   The Westerners comprise six Americans, four Britons and two West
Germans and a missing Italian. Most are believed held by Shiite
factions linked to Hezbollah, Tehran's main ally in Lebanon.
   The conservative daily Ad-Diyar, citing unidentified diplomatic
sources, said Syrian President Hafez Assad worked out the accord to
free the Westerners in talks in Tehran last week with President
Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran.
   The Iranian Embassy in Beirut and the headquarters of the Syrian
security force in west Beirut declined comment on the newspaper
report.
   In New York, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said:
``We welcome the release of the 40 Shiite Muslim prisoners in
Lebanon.
   ``It is consistent with our position that for humanitarian
reasons, all persons being detained without legal basis in the
Middle East should be released immediately. Our particular concern
is quite naturally the Americans being held hostage in Lebanon, and
we call upon all parties to use their influence to effect their
immediate and unconditional release.
   ``As President Bush has indicated, the release of American
hostages would help improve our relations with countries
contributing to that release.''
   There have been other indications that efforts to free the
captives were gathering momentum amid the Persian Gulf crisis
triggered by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iran's Ambassador to Pakistan, a country used by the Americans
as a conduit into Tehran, said shortly before Assad's visit to the
Iranian capital that some hostages could be freed soon. And Iran
and Britain restored relations last week, ending a 19-month rift.
   Ad-Diyar said the releases would begin not with the freeing of a
Westerner held in Lebanon but with Iran freeing British businessman
Roger Cooper ``within the next few days to warm up the newly
resumed diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran.''
   Cooper has been in prison in Tehran since 1985. Iran says he is
a spy and was convicted last year, but has never disclosed his
sentence.
   Ad-Diyar said that after Cooper's release, pro-Iranian Shiites
in Lebanon would free their British hostages.
   Shiite political and religious leaders have said privately that
two of the missing Britons, World War II flying ace Jack Mann and
writer Alec Collett, have never figured in negotiations to free
hostages. These talks have involved only Anglican Church envoy
Terry Waite and journalist John McCarthy, they said.
   Ad-Diyar said the third stage of the plan would be the start of
serious negotiations for releasing six U.S. hostages simultaneously
with the release of frozen Iranian assets held in the United States
since 1979.
   The United States agreed to hand over assets worth at least $200
million last month, and sources close to a U.S.-Iranian tribunal in
The Hague have said larger claims are nearing settlement.
   Among the Americans held in Lebanon is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He is the
longest held of the hostages. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Home-Buying Ability Improves in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falling prices and mortgage rates combined
with rising incomes in August to improve the typical American
family's ability to buy a home, a real estate trade group said
Monday.
   But the National Association of Realtors said the improvement
was curtailed by the Persian Gulf crisis and weakness in the
overall economy.
   The Realtors said its housing affordability index rose from
102.4 in July to 105.6 in August. That meant a family with a median
income of $34,467 had 105.6 percent of the income needed to buy a
median-priced existing home costing $97,000.
   The median means half of the families earn more and half earn
less, or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less.
   ``Declining interest rates in early August, which brought
borderline buyers into the market, had the biggest positive impact
on the index reading last month,'' said Realtors President Norman
D. Flynn. ``However, the decline was short-lived due to the Middle
East conflict and resulting United States military build-up in the
Persian Gulf.''
   Flynn said that while the problems with the economy were not
rooted in the Persian Gulf crisis, the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait has ``greatly increased the chances for a recession.''
   ``Due to increasing oil prices, we expect rates to increase
during most of the fourth quarter, pushing the housing
affordability index down,'' Flynn said. ``However, we don't expect
the index to go much below the 100 mark.''
   The interest rate used to calculate the index declined from
10.15 percent in July to 9.98 percent in August but has returned to
double-digits. The rate is a composite of fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate mortgages as reported by the Federal Housing
Finance Board.
   The median price for a house fell $1,800 from $98,300 in July,
while the median income rose $109 from $34,358 the previous month.
   The changes resulted in a $19 decrease, to $680, in monthly
mortgage payments including principal and interest.
   The August median income exceeded the $32,633 needed to qualify
for a median-priced home. A family earning the median actually
would qualify to buy a home priced at $102,400 using conventional
financing covering 80 percent of the cost.
   Under August's affordability conditions, a family earning
$20,000 would have sufficient income to qualify for a $59,500 home
using a $47,600 loan. A family earning $30,000 would qualify for an
$89,300 home with a $71,400 loan.
   A family earning $40,000 would have sufficient income to qualify
for a $119,000 home with a $95,200 loan. And a family with a
$50,000 income would qualify for a $149,000 home using a $119,000
loan.

<DATELINE>ST. PETER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Things may get a bit chaotic with about
4,000 people expected to be on hand, but then the subject that's
attracting everyone is chaos.
   The growing field of mathmatics will be discussed at the the
26th annual Nobel Conference at Gustavus Adolphus College.
   At its basic, chaos says that very simple mathematical formulas
can produce very complex behavior. It also says that some very
complex and irregular action has underlying simplicity.
   Chaos seems to have application in such diverse fields as
weather forecasting, psychology and economics.
   Samuel Patterson, professor of mathematics at Carleton College
in Northfield, referred to chaos as the study of turbulence.
   The two-day conference, which starts Tuesday, has the official
endorsement of the Nobel Foundation, which presents the Nobel
Prizes. The foundation provides only its name, not funding, said
school spokesman Brett Pyrtle.
   Each year a group at Gustavus Adolphus picks a topic, invites
experts to speak and the public to listen.
   It has been practice to have at least one Nobel Prize winner at
the conference. This year it is Ilya Prigogine, who received the
prize for chemistry in 1977 and is author of several books on
chaos.
   Among the speakers will be John Polkinghorne, an Anglican priest
and president of Queen's College at Cambridge, England, who puts a
theological twist on chaos. He says chaos allows for free will and
divine influence, concepts at odds with Newtonian mathematics that
imply the universe runs like a clock.
   The final speaker for the conference will be journalist James
Gleick, whose 1987 book ``Chaos: Making a new Science,'' won a
National Book Award. The book has sold 300,000 copies in paperback.
   David Reese, associate professor of economics at Gustavus
Adolphus, said he has been meeting for about a year with a group of
people ranging from psychologists, who think chaos might explain
how people think, to biologists, who see chaos patterns in the
body's circulatory system.
   ``Chaos is tantalizing. It can be a new tool to research systems
- including economic - that don't repeat themselves, but stay
within certain boundaries,'' Reese said.
   An example of implications of chaos is the ``Butterfly Effect.''
In 1960, meteorologist Edward Lorenz discovered, while testing a
computer simulation of weather, that very small differences at the
outset resulted in very large differences at the end. That means
very long-range weather forecasting is impossible because
forecasters could never know enough of the original conditions.
   The name Butterfly Effect refers to the notion that the motion
of a butterfly's wings disturbing the air in Beijing might lead to
tornadoes in Kansas.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   VICTIM IMPACT
   
   The court agreed to review its recent decisions barring
sentencing juries from considering the character of the defendant's
victim or the grief of the victim's family.
   The court agreed to consider reinstating an Ohio man's death
penalty for a love-triangle murder.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that ``victim-impat'' evidence
should not be considered by sentencing juries. Last year, the
justices voted 5-4 that a jury generally may not be told about the
victim's character.
   That ruling was written by Justice William J. Brennan, who has
since retired. The four justices who dissented from last year's
decision said then they were ready to overturn the 1987 ruling and
permit victim-impact testimony in criminal sentencing.
   The case is Ohio vs. Huertas, 89-1944.
   
   OREGON DEATH ROW
   
   The court let stand rulings Oregon officials say will require
new sentencing trials for up to 22 of the state's death row
inmates.
   The justices, without comment, refused to review Oregon Supreme
Court rulings that last Jan. 11 overturned the death sentences of
three convicted murderers.
   The case is Oregon vs. Wagner, 89-1867.
   
   JURORS RACE
   
   The court agreed to decide whether lawyers in non-criminal cases
may bar potential jurors because of their race.
   The justices said they will use the case of an injured black
construction worker in Louisiana to decide whether such racially
motivated exclusions are prohibited in civil as well as criminal
trials.
   The case is Edmonson vs. Leesville Concrete Co., 89-7743.
   
   UNSUCCESSFUL ABORTION
   
   The court rejected an appeal by an Ohio woman who gave birth to
a healthy boy after she underwent an unsuccessful abortion.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that barred the
woman from suing a doctor and hospital for the costs of rearing her
child.
   The case is Harmath vs. Goler, 89-1824.
   
   RESERVES
   
   The court asked the Bush administration whether employers ever
may bar their workers from joining or serving in the military
reserves.
   The court wants to hear Justice Department lawyers' views on a
ruling that struck down the Baltimore Police Department's policy of
limiting the number of employees allowed to be in active reserve
units.
   The case is Tilghman vs. Kolkhorst, 89-1949.
   
   SEIZURE
   
   The court said it will try to clarify what authority police have
to pursue and detain people who run away after seeing police.
   The justices agreed to consider reinstating the cocaine
conviction and 68-month sentence of an Oakland, Calif., youth who a
state court said was chased and caught unlawfully by police.
   The case is California vs. Hodari D., 89-1632.
   
   BIAS ABROAD
   
   The court agreed to decide whether U.S. businesses are
lawbreakers if they discriminate against Americans they employ
outside the country.
   The justices, setting the case for an important ruling, said
they will decide whether Congress intended a major anti-bias law to
reach beyond the nation's borders.
   The cases are EEOC vs. Arabian American Oil Co., 89-1838, and
Boureslana vs. Arabian American Oil Co., 89-1845.
   
   PILOTS
   
   The court agreed to use a dispute over the settlement of a
strike by Continental Air Lines pilots to set new guidelines on the
duties of unions to represent their members.
   The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit against the
Air Line Pilots Association by striking pilots who said the union
denied them fair representation.
   The case is Air Line Pilots Association vs. O'Neill, 89-1493.
   
   DRUG TESTING
   
   The court permitted the random drug testing of New York City's
10,000 jail guards.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the guards'
labor union, which said the tests violate the corrections officers'
privacy rights.
   The case is Seelig vs. Koehler, 90-48.
   
   CHURCH SCHOOLS
   
   The court let stand a ruling that church-run schools must pay
employees the federa minimum wage and may not pay women teachers
less than men.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by officials of a
Baptist church in Virginia who said forcing the church to abide by
federal labor law violates its religious freedom and other
constitutional rights.
   The case is Shenandoah Baptist Church vs. Dole, 90-16.
   
   HOWARD BEACH
   
   The court rejected the appeal of three white men from New York
City convicted in the ``Howard Beach incident'' of 1986, a racially
motivated attack in which a black man died.
   The justices, without comment, let stand the manslaughter and
assault convictions of Jon Lester, Scott Kern and Jason Ladone.
Lawyers for the three men had argued they wrongly were limited in
excluding blacks as trial jurors.
   The case is Kern vs. New York, 89-2032.
   
   NUDE DANCING
   
   The court agreed to consider letting states outlaw all
barroom-style nude dancing as it voted to hear an effort to
reinstate such an Indiana law.
   The court said it will review a ruling that ``non-obscene nude
dancing performed as entertainment is expression and as such is
entitled to limited protection under the (Constitution's) First
Amendment.''
   The case is Barnes vs. Glen Theatre Inc., 90-26.
   
   PRISONS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether unfit living conditions may
amount to cruel and unusual punishment when there is no evidence
officials acted maliciously.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by an Ohio inmate who
accused officials of being indifferent to overcrowding,
rat-infested kitchens, freezing cold in winter, scalding heat in
summer and other miserable conditions.
   The case is Wilson vs. Seiter, 89-7376.
   
   HONDURAN
   
   The court permitted the prosecution of an alleged drug dealer
who said U.S. officials kidnapped and tortured him.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that the
defendant should be freed because U.S. officials violated
international law and the U.S. and Honduran constitutions.
   The case is Matta-Ballesteros vs. Henman, 89-1797.
   
   HILARY FORETICH
   
   The court refused to block any future broadcast of part of a
television documentary about the internationally publicized custody
battle over Hilary Foretich.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that it would be
unlawful censorship to keep off the air a four-minute portion of
the telecast dealing with alleged sex abuse.
   The case is Foretich vs. Lifetime Cable, 90-35.
   
   LIBEL
   
   The court agreed to consider reinstating a libel lawsuit against
Janet Malcolm, a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, by a
psychologist who says she made up quotes attributed to him.
   The justices said they will review a federal appeals court
ruling that last year threw out Jeffrey Masson's suit.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that public figures
who sue for libel over allegedly altered quotes must show that the
quotes are not even ``rational interpretations'' of what was said.
   The case is Masson vs. The New Yorker, 89-1799.
   
   ATHEISTS
   
   The court turned down an appeal by a group of atheists
challenging an oath for potential trial jurors that includes the
phrase ``so help me God.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings in a Texas case
that excluding atheists from jury service for refusing to take such
an oath does not violate their rights.
   The case is Murray vs. Travis County District Court, 89-2018.
   
   ENVIRONMENTAL FINE
   
   The court turned down the appeal of a Pennsylvania man given the
longest prison sentence and biggest fine in U.S. history for any
person convicted of an environmental crime.
   The court, without comment, let stand the three-year prison term
and $200,000 fine John Pozsgai of Morrisville, Pa., received for
violating the Clean Water Act.
   The case is Pozsgai vs. U.S., 89-1735.
   
   CABLE TV
   
   The court agreed to resolve a dispute from Arkansas over the
power of states to tax cable television companies and subscribers.
   The court said it will review a ruling that Arkansas may tax
cable TV as long as it also imposes the levy on similar
communication services, such as the unscrambling of satellite
signals.
   The cases are Pledger vs. Medlock, 90-29, and Medlock vs.
Pledger, 90-38.

<HEAD>Peace Prize Guessing Game: a Scandinavian Tradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Norwegian Nobel Institute and the
country's news media are in the throes of a guessing game with
traditions as strong as the Peace Prize itself.
   The ritual is simple: Norway's press tries to guess the name of
the annual Nobel laureate. And the institute says nothing, even
though the decision was probably made several months ago.
   ``We never say who the winner is before the official
announcement,'' said institute director Geir Lundestad. There are
100 nominations, including 26 organizations, for the 71st Peace
Prize, he said. The winner will be announced Oct. 15 in Oslo.
   The other Nobel prizes will be announced in Stockholm, starting
with medicine on Oct. 8. The economics prize, established in 1968
and funded by the Bank of Sweden, will be announced Oct. 16.
   Physics and chemistry prizes, funded by income from the will of
dynamite-inventor Alfred Bernard Nobel, will be announced Oct. 17.
The date for the literature prize has not been announced.
   This year's prizes are worth $695,000.
   ``There is an opportunity for one more meeting, but most of the
pieces have fallen into place,'' Lundestad said when asked if a
1990 Peace Prize winner had been selected.
   The media has picked four hot names: Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, African National Congress Deputy President Nelson
Mandela, Chinese pro-democracy student leader Chai Ling and
Czechoslovak President Vaclev Havel.
   Their brash predictions are sometimes off by a continent or two.
Late last year, newspapers were betting on Eastern Europe's
democratic reform leaders when the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual
leader of Tibet, had probably already been selected.
   Other recent winners were Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's
Solidarity Union, South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
Mother Teresa and the United Nations Peace keeping Forces.
   Lundestad said the great secrecy about the coveted prize, first
awarded in 1901, protects some candidates from reprisals or keeps
their activities confidential.
   Names of candidates are never released. No notes leave the room
after deliberations by the five-member Nobel Peace Prize Committee,
appointed by Norway's parliament for six-year terms.
   But nominations are often announced by those forwarding a
candidate.
   ``There are thousands of people and organizations with the right
to nominate, including former laureates, elected officials, even
some university professors and organizations,'' said Lundestad, who
is not a voting member of the committee.
   The picture becomes more clouded by scores of nominations from
groups who have no right to make them. Norway's largest labor
union, for example, announced its enthusiastic but invalid
nomination of Gorbachev.
   ``In that particular case, the name was also forwarded in
several other valid nominations,'' Lundestad said. He confirmed the
nomination because several groups have announced it.
   The five-employee institute sifts through thousands of letters a
year, hunting for valid nominations that arrived before the Feb. 1
deadline.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year pushed for the award in a
secret campaign that appears to have started after a winner had
already been selected.
   ``It doesn't do any good anyway,'' Lundestad said about such
campaigns.
   The fiercely independent committee, aided by institute
researchers, searches for a person or group fulfilling criteria set
in Nobel's will.
   There have been 19 years in which no prize was awarded.

<TEXT>
   The gray doors of a prison swung open Monday
and Karsten Petermann strolled into the sunlight, a free man in a
free land for the first time in his life.
   ``It's a new chance,'' Petermann, 21, said as he walked through
the massive steel gate of East Berlin's high-security Rummelsburg
Prison.
   Petermann was among the first convicts freed after the East
German Parliament, in one of its last official acts before German
unity on Wednesday, adopted a broad amnesty plan for people behind
bars.
   The program, meant to make up for the harsh sentences handed
down by the former Communist regime, trims prison sentences by a
third for all inmates who were not convicted of violent crimes.
   It was also a bit of a shock for inmates who were released not
only into a newly democratic East Germany, but one that is two days
from being absorbed by West Germany.
   Sven Heyse, 20, served 13 months of a 20-month sentence he said
was handed down because he stoe 50 East German marks from his
sister's boyfriend. That cash was the equivalent of about 20 West
German marks ($12) under the former official exchange rate.
   ``We lived in an oppressive land and we could never have
expected this kind of amnesty from the Communists under Honecker
and Mielke,'' he said, referring to ousted Communist Party boss
Erich Honecker and the chief of his secret police, Erich Mielke.
   Heyse, from the East German city of Magdeburg, said he plans to
live in West Berlin.
   ``We wanted very much to be out here,'' said Sven Bein, 22, an
East Berliner who also was released from Rummelsburg on Monday.
   Petermann, who said he was convicted of breaking into a house
and given a severe sentence because of his political views, said
the amnesty is a ``great chance to start over.''
   ``I'm for unification,'' said Petermann, who served 20 months of
his sentence. ``I never thought it would happen so fast.''
   Heyse, Bein and Petermann were among five youthful offenders
freed Monday from the 400-inmate prison.
   Lawmakers feuded bitterly over the amnesty plan before adopting
it late Friday, their last act before meeting for a final time
Tuesday to officially dissolve East Germany.
   The amnesty was meant to help people who were given unjustly
harsh sentences by the former Communist government, which often
used sentences for petty crimes to punish people who resisted the
rigidly controlled social system.
   ``Naturally, all of these people are very pleased,'' said Helmut
Raschdorff, an official at Rummelsburg Prison.
   He said he expects 115 inmates at the prison to fall under the
amnesty program and hundreds of others nationwide. Each will be
released after serving two-thirds of his sentence.
   The amnesty is the second since the Communist government was
ousted last autumn. Early this year, scores of political prisoners
were released.
   The weeks of debate over the latest amnesty program coincided
with uprisings at prisons across East Germany. Inmates occupied
prison rooftops and staged hunger strikes to demand amnesty.
   The government of a united Germany still has to deal with
perhaps an even more senstive topic: whether to grant amnesty to
the spies and secret police agents from the former Communist
government.

   Sometimes it pays to solve a case. The

solve who killed Laura Palmer and was second in preliminary
ratings, Nielsen estimates showed Monday.
   ABC's show lost to NBC's Perry Mason, who solved ``The Case of
the Defiant Daughter'' in a two-hour TV movie of the same name.
NBC's film averaged a 13.9 ratings in overnight ratings from 22
U.S. cities.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' the surreal, brooding David Lynch-Mark Frost
series about sex, violence and furtive doings in a Pacific
Northwest town, averaged a 13.2 rating as it began its second
season with a a tangled, two-hour premiere.
   The series goes into its regular time period Saturday.
   CBS' ``Face of Fear,'' a two-hour TV movie, was third in the
Sunday movie battles, averaging a 12.8 rating.
   National ratings will be available Tuesday.
   The 22 cities in Sunday's overnight audience estimates represent
44.3 percent of the nation's 93.1 million homes with television, a
Nielsen spokeswoman said.
   The overnight ratings usually are from 24 cities. But ratings
from Portland, Ore., weren't available, ABC said, and ABC's
Washington, D.C., affiliate, WJLA-TV, delayed the season premiere
of ``Twin Peaks'' until 11:30 p.m. EDT.
   WJLA instead broadcast the Washington Redskins-Phoenix Cardinals
National Football League game, for which it had contracted before
ABC announced a premiere date for ``Twin Peaks,'' an ABC
spokeswoman said.

   Three times astronaut Mike Lounge
has said goodbye to his wife and three children the day before
Columonauts and
a satellite that will study the sun's unexplored polar regions.
   Lounge, who was assigned to that flight before the 1986
Challenger explosion, said he will be relieved to see Discovery go
up. It would be NASA's first shuttle flight since April, when
Discovery carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
   ``If they don't get off, all this clamor you hear in the press
and on the street will be magnified by 10,'' he said. ``We need a
win.''
   Lounge said much of the criticism heaped on the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration in recent months is
unwarranted.
   ``The NASA I see day to day is very meticulous and very honest
and industrious about getting the job done,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, Lounge said he is as perplexed as anyone about the
hydrogen leaks that have struck Columbia as well as Atlantis.
   ``I'm really surprised we're having this kind of problem in a
mature system, a system that's flown 35 times and for nine years,''
he said.
   No matter how bad things are, it could be worse, Lounge said.
   ``We've still got a mission. We're still going to fly it. We're
still healthy. We'll get it done, and it will be worth it when we
get there,'' he said.

   Sir David Lean, the 82-year-old director whose
films have won 27 Academy Awards, is planning to marry for the
sixth time, his lawyer said Monday.
   Lean will wed 51-year-old interior designer Sandra Cooke before
Christmas, said attorney Michael Gee.
   The couple met five years ago in the frozen-food department of
Harrods department store where Ms. Cooke went up to Lean and asked
when his next film was due, said The Daily Mail's columnist Nigel
Dempster.
   Lean and Ms. Cooke were vacationing in France, Gee said. The
director's next film project will be an adaptation of Joseph
Conrad's novel ``Nostromo.''
   Lean is the director of such classics as ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Great Expectations.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - NBC newswoman Jane Pauley, who has interviewed
hundreds of celebrities, says she's still waiting to land an
elusive scoop: her husband, Garry Trudeau.
   ``I have thought about asking him,'' said Pauley, ``but a) he
would never do it, and b) I would not ultimately do it. But I know
it's a neat story.''
   Trudeau, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, celebrates
Doonesbury's 20th anniversary this month.
   In an interview in the Oct. 8 issue of People magazine, Pauley
said Trudeau believes that ``the more high profile you become, the
more you have to maintain it. And you have to adjust your life for
updates, just to keep everyone aware, which is time consuming.''
   But Pauley said someone should persuade Trudeau to do an
interview.
   ``It's not going to be me, but I'm just going to be really
irritated if it turns up on somebody else's network.''

   Former major leaguer Jim Bouton struck out
Monday with his pitch to the Supreme Court to revive a big-stakes
contract battle over a baseball bubble gum product.
   Bouton lost an appeal to revive a $1 million damage award. The
justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the
award against a subsidiary of the Wrigley chewing gum company.
   Bouton, a best-selling author and former pitching star, was with
a minor league team in Portland, Ore., in 1977, when he and coach
Rob Nelson came up with the idea that led to Big League Chew,
shredded bubble gum in a pouch.
   The idea was to devise a good-tasting substitute for chewing
tobacco, a macho symbol for many big leaguers.
   The novelty was a bonanza that launched Bouton's business
career. Sales were $18 million in 1981 after Bouton and Nelson
teamed up with Amurol Products Co. of Naperville, Ill., a Wrigley
subsidiary, to market the bubble gum.
   Bouton, who lives in Teaneck, N.J., got into a dispute with
Amurol in 1984 over an advertising campaign for the gum. That led
to a Mailgram the company sent to Bouton agreeing to new contract
terms.
   A federal judge in New York City ruled that Amurol violated the
agreement, and ordered it to pay Bouton and his partner nearly $1
million plus interest.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May overturned
the award.
   Bouton retired from baseball in 1970 and wrote ``Ball Four,'' a
humorous account of his life in the sport that was on the
best-seller list for months.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A car dealer has offered Mayor Bill
Boner $75,000 to resign. But Boner was busy in Hawaii, where he
reportedly was marrying an aspiring country singer on Monday.
   ``It is obvious to all of Nashville that Bill Boner is
distracted from his job,'' businessman Lee Beaman said Friday.
``Our city is suffering from the void in leadership.
   ``In order to make it easier for Mayor Boner to resign, I have
offered to pay the $75,000 in salary he would be giving up if he
resigns now.''
   Boner, 45, turned heads in Nashville when he announced his
engagement to Traci Peel, 34, while he was still married to his
third wife.
   Boner's exploits were well chronicled after the Nashville Banner
published an interview with Peel in which she said the mayor's
passion could last seven hours. Bumper stickers quickly appeared
that said: ``Seven hours for Traci, three years for Nashville.''
   Boner spokesman Rick Runyeon said he knew nothing of the offer.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The Rev. Jeb Stuart Magruder, who spent
seven months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal, is
off for a new pastorship in Kentucky.
   Magruder, 55, has been executive minister at First Community
Church in Marble Cliff since 1984. On Nov. 1, he will take over as
senior pastor of the 600-member First Presbyterian Church in
Lexington, Ky.
   ``Life began for me again when I came here six years ago,''
Magruder told 1,000 worshipers Sunday. ``You gave me back my
identity and you gave me the inspiration to continue in my
ministry.''
   Magruder pleaded guilty in 1973 to conspiracy and perjury
charges stemming from the 1972 break-in at offices of the
Democratic Party at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C.
   He was deputy director of former President Nixon's re-election
committee.

   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - Scott Heimdal, who was held kidnapped
earlier this year while working in a South American jungle, has
married his Ecuadorian girlfriend and is settling back into a life
``as normal as can be.''
   Heimdal, 27, married Sandra Durango on Saturday. Other than the
groom forgetting his dress shoes on the way to church, the wedding
went off without a hitch. The bride's family traveled to Peoria
from their home in Quito, Ecuador.
   Heimdal was working for a mining company when he was taken
captive April 28 in the jungle along the Colombian-Ecuadoran
border. He was released two months later after his parents bought
his freedom for $60,000, raised in a frantic four-day fund drive.
   ``Life is as normal as it can be, getting married and all,'' he
said. But he was having trouble finding a job.
   ``I'll stay in Peoria if I can,'' said Heimdal, who specializes
in computers. ``With getting married, it's very frustrating not
being able to find work in Peoria.''

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-profile American general furled the
flag of his command Monday and said there was ``close cooperation''
with Soviet commanders who are also dropping some functions before
reunification.
   For the first time in 45 years, Germany will be a sovereign
nation at midnight Tuesday, and there will be no room for Soviet
border checks within the former East Germany, or Western Allied
military commandants with unusual law-making powers for West
Berlin.
   The U.S. commandant, Maj. Gen. Raymond E. Haddock, formally
deactivated his command at a ceremony attended by top-ranking
diplomats and his two Allied counterparts, British Maj. Gen. Robert
J.S. Corbett and French Maj. Gen. Francois Cann.
   The black-red-and-gold West German flag was flying for the first
time beside the U.S. flag over the cobblestone parade ground in
front of the old Nazi air force building that is the U.S. command
headquarters in West Berlin.
   Honor platoons from the U.S. Army and Air Force stood at
attention as Haddock furled his command flag, a red-and-white
banner with the black Berlin bear emblem, and put it in an
olive-drab cloth casing.
   The two-star general, who commanded the deployment of
nuclear-tipped Pershing II missiles in West Germany before he took
the top U.S. soldier-diplomat post in West Berlin, said Allied
determination to keep West Berlin part of the democratic world had
been tested repeatedly.
   ``We, in full cooperation with our French and British allies and
our German partners, have passed the test,'' he said.
   ``Berlin and Germany are being united in peace, in freedom, and
upon a firm foundation of democratic values and the rule of law. As
a result, the U.S. Command Berlin is being inactivated.''
   He told a later news conference that Soviet troops in East
Germany were ceasing to operate some border checkpoints.
   The Soviets had even invited Western Allied officers to join
closing-down celebrations, such as at the Glienecke Bridge, the
famed spy-exchange crossing point between West Berlin and Potsdam
in East Germany, he said.
   ``They are joining with us to return normality to what will be a
sovereign nation in a few hours,'' Haddock said. ``It's a matter of
close cooperation and working together.''
   But no Soviets attended Haddock's deactivation ceremony, nor did
military representatives from West Germany. Haddock said West
German military officials had been invited to attend but declined
because the present status of West Berlin forbids a German military
presence in the city.
   ``I respect that decision but I want it made absolutely clear
that an invitation was extended,'' he said, noting that a retired
top West German general attended the ceremony.
   Forbidding a German military role in Berlin was a key element of
the post-war Allied policy of demilitarizing Germany.
   The deactivation of the American, British and French commandant
functions in West Berlin will be marked at a ceremony Tuesday in
which generals of the three countries hand their powers over to
German officials, opening the way for a German military presence in
the city.
   The Soviets and the three Western allies will continue to base
troops in Germany after the two Germanys unify.
   The Soviets have agreed to withdraw their troops by the end of
1994.
   The Western allies are talking about troop reductions in what is
now West Germany, and are expected to pull their forces out of West
Berlin as the Soviets leave East Germany.
   Haddock said the present U.S. strength of about 6,000 troops in
West Berlin will be cut in the coming year by about 700 ``as a sign
that we are ready to reduce our force in Berlin.''
   And, as the Soviets are ending border checkpoints, so are the
Allies, he said. But he refused to liken the Western presence in
Germany to that of the Soviets.
   ``We have been asked to stay here, they have been asked to
leave,'' he said.
   Haddock's post as commandant held an unusual combination of
military and diplomatic duties, reflecting the fact that Berlin has
been, in legal terms, an occupied city since 1945. Laws passed by
the West German parliament have to be signed by the three Allied
commandants before taking effect in West Berlin.
   That power fades into history at midnight Tuesday.

   President Bush today denounced Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein as an international outcast who plundered
Kuwait. But Bush also offered Baghdad hope that relinquishing its
grip on its Persian Gulf neighbor could spur negotiations on the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The president's speech to the U.N. General Assembly blended
condemnation of Saddam with an overture for a resolution of the
two-month crisis. ``We seek a peaceful outcome, a diplomatic
outcome,'' Bush said.
   Significantly, he offered the Iraqi leader the prospect of ``new
arrangements'' among the states in the gulf region as well as a
chance for a settlement between the Arabs and Israel - provided
Iraq leaves Kuwait unconditionally.
   ``Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era, a
dark relic from a dark time,'' Bush said. ``It has plundered
Kuwait, terrorized innocent civilians and held even diplomats
hostage.''
   The president, lining up with a proposal first advanced last
week by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said Iraq
and its leadership must be held liable ``for these crimes of abuse
and destruction.''
   But, at the same time, Bush edged perceptibly closer to Saddam's
demand that his territorial dispute with Kuwait be linked to the
Arabs' grievance with Israel for holding on to territory Syria and
Jordan lost in the 1967 Mideast war.
   Shevardnadze said afterward that Bush had delivered ``a
brilliant speech.''
   A similar gesture last week by President Francois Mitterrand of
France drew a mixed response Sunday from Saddam, who suggested that
Iraq would fight to defend its seizure of Kuwait but also offered
to open a `debate'' with France on the region's future.
   ``We intend to make contacts with the French government to
explain after inquiry, questioning and dialogue our views
accurately so that everything is based on clear ideas and
actions,'' the Iraqi leader said in a broadcast message on the
birthday of the Muslim prophet Mohammed.
   Mitterrand, in a four-step proposal, called first for Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait, which it invaded on Aug. 2. The pullout
would be supervised by international observers as the emirate's
sovereignty was restored.
   Then, negotiators would deal with the division of Lebanon and
the Arab-Israel conflict. In the fourth stage, armaments in the
Middle East and the Persian Gulf would be scaled down.
   Bush reiterated that Iraq's annexation of Kuwait will not be
permitted to stand, and that Saddam has placed his country against
the world.
   However, the president said, ``In the aftermath of Iraq's
unconditional departure from Kuwait, I truly believe that there may
be opportunities:
   ``For Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently;
for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for
stability; and for all the states and peoples of the region to
settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.
   ``And yet,'' Bush said, ``the world's key task - now, first and
always - must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be
tolerated or rewarded.''
   The speech seemed to reflect a U.S. policy shift. Throughout the
gulf crisis, U.S. officials insisted that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait
could not be linked in any way to the Arab-Israeli dispute or other
regional problems.
   The United States has long been committed to a Mideast
settlement in which Israel would exchange territory for Arab
recognition of its right to exist. Bush made no reference on how
the talks would be held; the Soviets and the Arabs demand a Mideast
peace conference, but the Israeli government objects.
   In an exchange with reporters later, Bush said his position had
not changed.
   ``There is no flexibility here,'' he said.
   Asked, then, if his speech reflected a shift in emphasis, Bush
replied, ``You are reading too much into this. There is no nuance.
...'' to be read into the remarks.
   On the question of whether the U.N. should vote to authorize the
use of force against Iraq, Bush said, ``We have not been pressing
for that at this point.''
   Bush said that some experts now believe that, ``this man
(Hussein) if you look at his record, will do a `180.' You look at
his history with Iran and he's done a 180-degree turn and done
exactly what he said he wouldn't do.''
   Bush assured Saddam that ``we seek no advantages for ourselves''
in the gulf.
   Nor, he said, ``do we seek to maintain our military forces in
Saudi Arabia for one day longer than is necessary.''
   Bush said the 165,000 U.S. troops defending the oilfields of
Saudi Arabia were sent there at the request of the Saudi government
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invastion of Kuwait.
   ``The American people - and this president - want every single
American soldier brought home as soon as the mission is
accomplished,'' he said.
   Bush praised the Soviet Union for collaborating with the United
States in a worldwide cutoff of trade with Iraq. The superpowers
``had indeed put four decades of history behind us,'' he said.
   More than ever before, Bush said, the United Nations is now ``a
center for international collective security.''
   The passage hinted that the United States and Soviet Union would
seek Security Council approval for military action against Iraq if
Saddam does not withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   U.S. officials said Sunday the two superpowers, as well as a
number of other countries, had begun preliminary drafting of
resolutions to authorize the use of force.
   Praising the U.N.'s resolve, Bush said, ``this challenge is a
test we cannot afford to fail. I am confident we will prevail.''
   The gulf crisis and the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, along with the ballistic missiles ``that can
rain destruction upon distant peoples,'' contrasted with the rosy
picture of a world emerging from Cold War tensions.
   ``We've seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed
wire give way to a new era of peace, cooperation and freedom,'' the
president said.
   Behind the scenes, meanwhile, the United States, the Soviet
Union and a number of other nations have begun drafting resolutions
to take action against Iraq if the squeeze does not force Iraq to
release its hold on Kuwait, U.S. officials said Sunday.
   ``Everybody is looking at options, thinking what can we do
next,'' said a U.S. official who described the Soviet Union's
approach to Saddam as potentially tougher than the stance taken by
the Bush administration.
   The drafting has not reached the point where Bush is ready to
make an announcement. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, described it as ``back of the envelope'' work at this
point.

<HEAD>Justices Reject 3 Appeals in Howard Beach Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's rejection Monday of an
appeal by three white defendants in the Howard Beach racial death
case closes off only one avenue of appeal, a defense attorney says.
   ``There are some new trial issues which we will be exploring,''
said lawyer Charles Weintraub.
   The court made no comment when it let stand the manslaughter and
assault convictions of Jon Lester, Scott Kern and Jason Ladone.
Weintraub had argued they were wrongly limited in excluding blacks
as trial jurors.
   New York's highest court rejected the argument last March.
   ``The issues were significant, but obviously the court is not
prepared to address those issues at this time,'' Weintraub said.
``There are some other issues that will be addressed in new trial
motions.''
   He refused to discuss what the new issues would be.
   On Dec. 19, 1986, a car carrying four black men broke down in
the predominantly white Howard Beach section of the borough of
Queens.
   Three of the men - Michael Griffith, Cedric Sandiford and
Timothy Grimes - left the car to seek assistance.
   The three were attacked by a gang of white teen-agers, including
Lester, Kern and Ladone, according to trial testimony.
   The youths chased Griffith onto a highway, where he was struck
and killed by a car. Sandiford was beaten with a baseball bat and
tree limbs.
   The case galvanized black activists in New York. In the weeks
that followed, police reported a sharp increase in racial violence
in the city. Several fights between blacks and whites were
punctuated by cries of ``Howard Beach, Howard Beach.''
   During the 1987 trial of Lester, Kern and Ladone, prosecutors
complained that the defense lawyers were using their peremptory, or
automatic, challenges of potential jurors to exclude all blacks.
   In response to the prosecutors' complaints, the trial judge,
Justice Thomas Demakos, barred the defendants' lawyers from using
their automatic challenges to exclude potential jurors because of
their race.
   Defense lawyers argued unsuccessfully that prosecutors were
using their automatic challenges to keep whites off the jury.
   The state's highest court upheld the three men's convictions
after ruling that defendants' lawyers in all criminal cases may be
barred from excluding potential jurors because of their race.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 barred prosecutors from doing
that, ruling that such exclusions are unconstitutional. But the
justices never have said the U.S. Constitution imposes such a
prohibition on defense lawyers.
   The state court's ruling appeared to rely solely on the New York
Constitution.
   Lawyers for Lester, Kern and Ladone said the state court ruling
was an unwarranted expansion of the Supreme Court's 1986 decision.
   The appeal said the New York Constitution, as interpreted by the
state court, should be declared a violation of the U.S.
Constitution's protections for criminal defendants' fair-trial
rights.
   Lester was sentenced to up to 30 years in prison, Kern to up to
18 years, and Ladone to up to 15 years. Weintraub said all have
begun serving time.

<DATELINE>PARROTT, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old Indiana boy who was planning a
trip to his grandparents' home but couldn't find their town on a
map helped make Parrott one of eight towns added to Rand McNally's
newest atlas.
   The western Virginia town of 800 people thanked Chris Muncy for
its newfound recognition by designating Sunday as Chris Muncy Day.
The 1991 atlas appeared nationwide Monday.
   ``I was helping my mom and dad plan our trip to my
grandparents', but Parrott wasn't on the map,'' said Chris, of
Mishawaka, Ind. Chris's maternal grandparents and great-grandmother
live in Parrott.
   Chris wrote last year to Rand McNally asking that it include the
town, which is about 35 miles west of Roanoke. Parrott was the only
locality added this year as the result of a private request, Rand
McNally spokesman Mike Braden said.
   There are no set rules for inclusion in the atlas, said Braden,
noting that cartographers are always on the lookout for communities
they may have missed.
   Most atlas revisions result from updates to federal, state or
local government records, said Michael Dobson, Rand McNally vice
president of Cartographic Services.
   The 1991 edition is the Skokie, Ill., map maker's 67th annual
revision.
   The last addition in Virginia was Love, in the 1990 atlas.
   The other 1991 additions are: Stoneridge, Mo., Bell Terre, N.Y.,
Huntington Bay, N.Y., Old Field, N.Y., Poquott, N.Y., Saltaire,
N.Y., and Sea-Tac, Wash.

   The Suprem  Court, opening its 1990-91 term
one justice short, agreed Monday to decide whether juries may
impose stiffer sentences because of a crime's impact on the victims
or their families.
   The court said it will use a case from Ohio to consider
reversing recent rulings banning such victim-impact evidence.
   The case was among some 1,000 acted upon by the eight justices
as they returned from a three-month summer recess. They rejected
appeals in the vast majority, agreeing to hear and decide just 25.
   David H. Souter, President Bush's first nominee to the high
court, is expected to fill the vacancy created by the July
retirement of Justice William J. Brennan. The Senate is expected to
confirm Souter on Tuesday, making him the 105th justice in the
court's history.
   The court in this term plans to hear arguments in key cases
involving abortion counseling, fetal protection, school
desegregation and the war on drug. The justices previously granted
review of appeals in those cases.
   For the first time in 34 years, Brennan was not on the bench as
the court convened for a new term. He walked into the courtroom
using a cane and sat in a section reserved for special guests as
his former colleagues paid tribute to him.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist praised Brennan for his
personal warmth and wise counsel as he read an exchange of letters
between Brennan and the other justices. Brennan, 84, the court's
leading liberal voice, retired because of failing health.
   In other matters, the court:
   -Agreed to consider letting states outlaw all barroom-style nude
dancing. The court will consider reinstating such an Indiana ban.
   -Refused to free a Southern Baptist seminary in New Orleans from
having to grant a divinity degree to a man the seminary says is
unfit for Christian ministry.
   -Refused to block the possible rebroadcast of part of a
television documentary about the internationally publicized child
custody battle over Hilary Foretich. A lower court said it is
unlawful censorship to keep off the air a four-minute portion of
the telecast dealing with alleged sex abuse.
   -Agreed to use a dispute over the settlement of a Continental
Air Lines pilots strike to set new guidelines on the duties of
unions in representing their members.
   -Agreed to consider reinstating a libel lawsuit against Janet
Malcolm, a writer for The New Yorker magazine. A lower court threw
out a suit against her by a psychologist who said she made up
quotes attributed to him.
   -Rejected an appeal by an Ohio woman who gave birth to a healthy
boy after she underwent an unsuccessful abortion. The woman was
barred from suing a doctor and hospital for the costs of rearing
the child.
   -Asked the Bush administration for its views on the power of
employers to bar workers from joining or serving in the military
reserves. The court is being asked to revive the Baltimore Police
Department's policy of limiting the number of employees allowed to
be in active reserve units.
   In the victim-impact case, the court said it will consider
reinstating the death penalty for Ediberto Huertas in a
love-triangle murder.
   Huertas fatally stabbed Ralph Harris Jr. in Lorain, Ohio, on
June 7, 1986. He now is serving a life sentence for the crime.
   On leave from the Air Force, Harris was spending the night with
Elba Ortiz. Huertas, who had fathered two children with Ms. Ortiz,
allegedly warned Harris he would ``waste him'' if he continued to
see the woman.
   A state jury imposed the death sentence after hearing evidence
that Harris' parents wanted Huertas to die for his crime. Elizabeth
Harris, the victim's mother, also testified emotionally that she
was proud of her churchgoing son and that his death had devastated
the victim's young son.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that such victim-impact evidence
should not be considered by sentencing juries.
   And last year, the justices voted 5-4 - with Brennan writing for
the court - that a jury generally may not be told about the
victim's character. The court said a South Carolina murderer
unfairly was sentenced to die because the jury heard such
testimony.
   The four justices who dissented from last year's decision said
then they were ready to overturn the 1987 ruling and permit
victim-impact testimony in criminal sentencing.
   The Ohio Supreme Court relied on both U.S. Supreme Court rulings
when it reduced Huertas' death sentence to life in prison last May.
   Prosecutors argued that the jury should have been allowed to
consider the impact of Harris' murder on his family because Huertas
and Harris had been high school friends and Huertas knew the
family. The killer was aware of the impact his crime would have on
the family, they said.
   But the Ohio Supreme Court said such evidence is relevant to the
sentence only when the evidence has ``a connection to the
defendant's personal responsibility and moral guilt.''
   Otherwise, the state court said, such testimony undermines the
defendant's right to be sentenced by an impartial jury.

   American and British relatives watched
a video recording Monday of the last radar blips of Pan Am Flight
103, in which their loved ones were killed by a terrorist bomb.
   ``It was like watching them being killed,'' one said.
   The start of the first public inquiry concentrated on events of
Dec. 21, 1988, when the Boeing 747 exploded over the nearby town of
Lockerbie, claiming 270 lives.
   As family members watched video screens in the courtroom, air
traffic controller Alan Topp traced the final moments of the square
blips on a green radar screen that indicated Flight 103 until the
moment the plane exploded.
   A square blip with a cross, from radar on the plane's flight
deck, vanished immediately, leaving an empty square, designating
ground radar readings.
   This single square gradually multiplied as the radar picked up
separate pieces of the disintegrating aircraft falling to earth
31,000 feet below.
   Topp, 54, who was at the Prestwick, Scotland, air traffic
control center, described frantic efforts to contact the plane.
   ``I came to the conclusion the clipper was lost when I didn't
get through and saw this mess'' on the screen, he said.
   Light debris from the aircraft showed as blips on the radar
screen drifting across the north of England and southern Scotland
for the next 20 to 30 minutes, Topp said.
   The fuel-laden wing section and part of the fuselage crashed in
Lockerbie less than a minute after the explosion, with a force
equivalent to an earthquake of 1.3 on the Richter scale, said
Terence Turbitt, a geophysicist with the British Geological Survey.
   ``The replay was horrible,'' said Dr. Jim Swire, who heads the
group of British relatives. ``Before it exploded, I could see in my
mind the inside of the cabin and its bright lights, warmth and
companionship.''
   ``From the moment the bomb went off, all hell must have broken
loose. We know the plane turned on its left side and went into a
vertical dive. What we don't know is how long they survived. That's
what's worrying us,'' he said.
   ``Can you imagine going from warmth and bright lights to a gale
with 400-knot winds which would blow your clothes off? ... That's
why most of the bodies had no clothes,'' said Swire, whose
24-year-old daughter Flora was on the plane.
   George Williams of Joppatowne, Md., whose only son, Geordie, a
24-year-old Army lieutenant, died in the crash, said a lump came to
his throat.
   ``To see the actual moment when my son lost his life was
tough,'' he said.
   For Pamela Dix of Dublin, whose brother Peter, 35, died, ``It
was like watching them being killed.''
   ``This is just the start. There's worse to come,'' said Jean
Flick of Coventry, whose son Clayton and his fiance were on the
plane.
   Like all the relatives, Mrs. Flick said, she wants the fatal
accident inquiry to reveal ``the truth'' about the crash.
   ``And those that haven't done their jobs right must be made
accountable,'' she said.
   Williams was tougher.
   ``I want people from Pan Am jailed, people from the government
censured and fired that were involved in the cover-up, and I want
the criminals executed,'' he said.
   The inquiry will examine airport security but will not take
evidence on the question of criminal responsibility for the
bombing.
   Capt. Robert L. Gould, Pan American World Airways' senior vice
president for operations who attended the opening, issued a
statement saying the airline also wants the truth.
   He said Pan Am wants airlines protected from terrorist attacks
but ``airports have not been built to meet today's sophisticated
terrorist threats and risks.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.18 percent, down from 7.32 percent
last week. Another $9.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.21 percent, down from 7.33 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.17
percent on Sept. 19, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 7.19
percent on Aug. 6, 1990.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.41 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,818.50 and 7.59 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,635.50
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.79
percent last week, up from 7.77 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Court Halts Controversial Affirmative Action Program in India</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India's Supreme Court ordered the
government on Monday to halt its controversial job quota program,
and appealed for an end to protests against the policy that have
killed dozens of people.
   ``We hope that the law and order situation will immediately
improve,'' Chief Justice Ranganath Mishra said after issuing the
ruling.
   The court's temporary injunction remains in effect until the
panel rules on the legality of the quotas. Press Trust of India
said the court could begin to hear arguments on the affirmative
action program as early as Oct. 25.
   At least 70 people have died in a rash of riots and student
suicides since Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced Aug. 7 that
almost half of all government jobs would be reserved for
lower-caste Hindus.
   Public opposition to the governmen has been widespread in the
politically influential cities of northern India. The army has been
called out and curfews clamped on several towns to control rioting
students, joined sometimes by middle-aged housewives and government
employees.
   Two members of Singh's governing party have resigned from
Parliament and some colleagues demanded his ouster because of the
quotas. Singh has refused to abandon the policy, saying it is an
affirmative action program that would give social justice to the
lower castes.
   Critics say he fears alienating the lower castes, which form a
majority of the eligible votes among India's 880 million people.
   Upper-caste students say reverse discrimination will deprive
them of government jobs for which they are better qualified.
   On Monday, the decision was taken out of Singh's hands.
   The Supreme Court said the government should take no action on
the policy's implementation until its legality is determined.
   ``Until the matter is heard - and we expect it to be finished
before the end of the year - no further steps should be taken,''
Mishra said.
   The court, however, allowed the government to continue
assembling a list of the thousands of castes that will qualify for
the job quotas.
   The plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for low-caste
Hindus. An additional 22 percent already are set aside for the
lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of Indian society,
tribespeople and the so-called untouchables.
   In Parliament, the government faced a separate problem Monday
when it failed to pass a constitutional amendment extending federal
rule in the northern state of Punjab, where Sikh militants are
fighting for independence.
   The state govenment in Punjab was dismissed in 1987 and replaced
by federal rule, which the Constitution limits to three years.
Amending the document requires a two-thirds majority.
   In a surprise move aimed at embarassing the government, the
opposition Congress Party refused to support the bill. Leaders of
all the parties were summoned to the speaker's chambers to find a
way out of the impasse.
   Singh' 10-month-old government suffered another setback when the
speaker of the legislature agreed to hold a debate on a motion
seeking to censure the government for mishandling the student
protest.
   The motion, if passed, would put pressure on the government to
quit, said Kewal Verma, a parliamentary analyst.
   ``There is no legal obligation on the part of the government to
resign, but it would amount to its defeat in moral terms,'' Verma
said.
   In the parliament, Congress Party members accused Singh of being
``obstinate'' for refusing to suspend or reconsider the affirmative
action plan. ``Down, down, resign, resign!'' they shouted as Singh
stood up to speak. He was prevented from addressing the house.
   ``Can't you see there is blood in your hands,'' said Congress
lawmaker Ajit Panja. Some members advanced menacingly at Singh but
were stopped by colleagues. ``You are a bloodstained politician,''
Panja said.
   Former Congress minister Vasant Sathe said he was beginning a
``fast unto death'' until Singh stops ``police terror'' on the
students.
   In the northern town of Jammu, 17-year-old student Sandeep
Sharma set himself on fire Monday in the latest suicide bid to
protest the job quotas. He suffered third-degree burns over most of
his body.
   At least 20 students have died in the past 12 days from
self-inflicted injuries. Most left notes blaming Singh's job
policy. In addition, 50 people have died by police gunfire in
street battles.

<TEXT>
   A Southern Baptist seminary in New Orleans
being forced to grant a divinity degree to a man it says is unfit
for Christian ministry lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday.
   The court left standing Louisiana rulings that force the
seminary to grant the degree as it rejected arguments that the New
Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary's religious freedom is being
trampled.
   The dispute centered on Rudolph Babcock's attempt to receive a
master of divinity degree in marriage and family counseling.
Seminary officials said Babcock was unfit because of ``continued
physical and verbal abuse of his wife.''
   A state appeals court ruled that it was not bound by numerous
past decisions keeping courts out of ecclesiastical, or
church-governing, disputes.
   ``This is not an ecclesiastical matter,'' the state court.
``This case involves an institution which, although perhaps having
characteristics of a church, necessarily functions as a school.''
   Lawyers for the seminary, after being denied help by the
Louisiana Supreme Court, sought help from the nation's highest
court.
   ``To permit such an action to stand would inextricably entangle
the government in the affairs of the church and have dire
consequences for every religious body in America,'' the seminary's
appeal said.
   In a supporting brief, the Baptist Joint Committee on Public
Affairs, the Christian Legal Society and the National Council of
Churches called the Louisiana appeals court ruling ``as astonishing
as it is unprecedented.''

<TEXT>
   Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay,
who relayed the orders to drop nuclear bombs Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, died Monday. He was 83.
   The retired four-star general, who would have been 84 on Nov.
15, died of a hert attack at the 22nd Strategic Hospital at March
Air Force Base, said Sgt. Steve Mahnke.
   LeMay directed the air attack on Japan at the end of World War
II.
   Years later, he said the nuclear bombings were unnecessary to
force Japan's surrender.
   ``We felt that our incendiary bombings had been so successful
that Japan would collapse before we invaded,'' LeMay said in a 1985
interview.
   ``We went ahead and droppped the bombs beccause President
(Harry) Truman told me to do it. He told me in a personal letter.''
   But LeMay said he felt the United States could have defeated
Japan in ``a few more days'' if it had continued the firebombing of
Japanese cities.
   LeMay, who lived in Newport Beach, also ran for vice president
with third-party candidate Geroge Wallace during the 1968
presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider
letting states outlaw all barroom-style nude dancing. The justices
voted to hear an effort to reinstate such a law from Indiana.
   The court will review a ruling that ``non-obscene nude dancing
performed as entertainment is expression and as such is entitled to
limited protection under the (Constitution's) First Amendment.''
   In striking down the use of Indiana's public indecency law to
prosecute nude dancing, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last
May relied heavily on a 1981 Supreme Court ruling.
   In it, the justices said, ``Nude dancing is not without its
First Amendment protections from official regulations.'' The 1981
decision did not specify the precise scope of those protections.
   The appeals court's ruling in May, reached by a 7-4 vote, said,
``While clearly not all conduct is expression, dance as
entertainment is a form of conduct that is inherently expressive.''
   The Indiana law was challenged by two South Bend businesses - a
bar and an adult bookstore that features live dancers - and three
women who say they want to dance without having to wear pasties and
G-strings.
   Indiana's appeal was supported in ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs
submitted by Arizona, Connecticut, Missouri, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania and by the American Family Association, previously
known as the National Federation for Decency.

   Tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationalists
marched to parliament in the capital of Kiev on Monday and chanted
slogans against the Communist Party and the republic's leaders,
witnesses and news reports said.
   One-day warning strikes idled factories in the more radical
western Ukraine, but many enterprises in Kiev continued working,
according to official Soviet media.
   Opposition members of the republic's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, walked out of the session, which opened Monday, after
its Communist majority upheld a decree banning rallies in front of
the parliament building, Soviet TV reported.
   The national evening TV news program ``Vremya'' showed scenes of
pushing and shoving on the floor of parliament as some of the
opposition deputies brought in the nationalist blue and gold flag
of the Ukraine, and some briefly tried to block access to the
podium.
   Leonid Dnitrenko, a spokesman for the pro-democracy Rukh
movement, said workers at the Arsenal machine-building plant, a
motorcycle plant and a shoe factory carried out a one-day warning
strike in support of the demonstrators. Some taxi drivers and
trolley bus drivers also went on strike, according to the
independent Interfax news service.
   Tass said most of the strikes occurred in the western Ukraine's
regions of Lvov, Ternopol and Ivano-Frankovsk.
   The rally began at October Square in the center of Kiev, after
20 minutes of speeches, demonstrators marched to parliament, where
they presented a list of their demands to legislators, Dnitrenko
said.
   Protesters carrying the traditional flags chanted slogans for
independence and against the party, the Soviet government and the
republic's leadership, according to ``Vremya'' and the official
Tass news agency.
   Tass estimated the crowd at 20,000 people, although activists
said there were more than 50,000. The rally paralyzed central Kiev
for more than two hours.
   According to Petro Borsuk, a secretary of the Ukrainian
Democratic Party, the demonstrators carried banners saying: ``The
New Union Treaty is New Slavery'' and ``No to the Union Treaty.''
   The treaty, which is still being negotiated, defines the
relationship between the Kremlin and the republics. Although it
would give the 15 Soviet republics more autonomy, nationalist
groups believe it does not go far enough and want it scrapped.
   Other placards branded the Communist Party as a criminal
organization that must go on trial and said the KGB was an enemy of
the people, Borsuk said.
   Dnitrenko and Borsuk said police observed the demonstration, but
did not try to interfere. They allowed a delegation to enter the
Supreme Soviet to present their list of demands.
   ``The militia were very friendly,'' Borsuk said.
   Police were reinforced by Interior Ministry troops in armored
personnel carriers, and members of special riot units were
stationed on sidestreets.
   A large rally also occurred in Donetsk, with miners and factory
workers demanding that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant be closed,
that Communist Party property be nationalized and that economic
reforms be speeded up, according to Interfax.
   Monday's demonstrations, as well as a protest rally Sunday in
the capital, were organized by DemBlock, a coalition of the Rukh
movement and other Ukrainian pro-democracy groups demanding greater
autonomy from the Kremlin.
   Among the demands by the nationalists are that Ukrainian men
drafted by the Soviet army serve only in the Ukraine; that the
Ukraine refuse to sign the union treaty; and that the Communist
Party be declared a ``criminal organization'' and stripped of
influence in all Ukrainian government organizations.
   The Ukraine is the second most populous of the Soviet republics,
after Russia, and is a key grain-growing area.
   Its parliament has declared sovereignty from Moscow and claims
the right to overrule national law. Rukh and other nationalist
groups want it to go further and take rapid moves toward secession.

   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Theo
Mitchell refused Monday to apologize for derogatory comments about
blacks who support GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Mitchell, a state senator seeking to become South Carolina's
first black governor, said he has no plans to retract his comments
even though it may cost him the opportunity to debate Campbell
before the general election.
   ``At this point in time, I see nothing to apologize for unless
it can be shown there's a reason,'' Mitchell said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press. He said he would elaborate on
the controversy at a news conference Tuesday.
   Within the past two weeks, Campbell has won the endorsement of
the predominantly black African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and
the South Carolina Conference of Black Mayors.
   Last week, Mitchell lashed out at the Rev. Richard Fisher,
bishop of the AME Zion Church, and five black mayors who announced
their support of Campbell.
   ``These are house niggers. ... These are Uncle Toms. These are
black prostitutes who are still being bought by white politicians,
selling out their people,'' Mitchell said during a radio program.
   Campbell and Mitchell were scheduled for a one-hour debate Oct.
22. But one day after Mitchell's comments, Campbell pulled out of
the debate.
   ``I'm not about to give him a forum for his vitriolic diatribe
that has come forth,'' Campbell said. The governor said he would
reconsider the debate if Mitchell retracted the statements and
apologized.

   A statewide poll released Monday showed
Republican George Voinovich leading Democrat Anthony J. Celebrezze
Jr. by 11 percentage points in the Ohio governor's race.
   The Ohio Poll found that Voinovich was favored by 50 percent of
those surveyed, while his Democratic opponent was preferred by 39
percent. Eleven percent said they would vote for neither candidate
or hadn't made a decision.
   The poll was conducted by the University of Cincinnati's

the Dayton Daily News and The Cincinnati Post.
   The institute said the telephone poll was conducted Sept. 17-25
in a random sample of 548 people who indicated they were likely to
vote in the Nov. 6 election. Pollsters said the survey had a margin
of error of 4 percentage points.
   An earlier Ohio Poll, published in May, showed Voinovich leading

<TEXT>
   Eight state attorneys general on Monday
complained to President Bush about a Republican fund-raising scheme
they compared to ``mail-order frauds and telemarketing scams.''
   In a letter to Bush, the attorneys general objected to a program
under which the Republican Presidential Task Force mailed $25
checks to more than a million potential campaign contributors.
   The task force asks recipients to deposit the checks in their
checking accounts to test a new Republican fund-raising procedure.
Cashing the checks authorizes the GOP to deduct $12.50 a month from
the recipients' checking accounts indefinitely unless consumers
take steps to halt the payments.
   ``This solicitation marks a shameful low in the history of
American campaigning,'' the attorneys general wrote to Bush. ``It
reduces the political process to the level of integrity normally
associated with fly-by-night con artists, mail frauds and
telemarketing scams.''
   Besides Abrams, the attorneys general of Minnesota, Oregon,
Alabama, North Dakota, Connecticut, Michigan and Illinois signed
the letter. Attorneys General Don Siegelman of Alabama and Neil
Hartigan of Illinois have filed lawsuits against the task force.
   The task force is an arm of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee.

<HEAD>Oregon Supreme Court Restores Five Initiatives to Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oregon Supreme Court has restored five
initiative measures to the Nov. 6 ballot, reversing a lower court
ruling that had disqualified them on a technicality.
   In a secondary ruling, the Supreme Court upheld lower court
decisions that had struck financial impact statements from three
measures on grounds officials missed a deadline for approving them.
   State law requires that financial estimates be printed on
ballots and in the state Voter's Pamphlet for measures having a
substantial impact on the state treasury.
   Two Marion County judges ruled that fiscal statements for three
measures were invalid because state officials approved them after a
legal deadline. Election officials had removed fiscal statements
from five other measures because they were handled under the same
procedures.
   The result was that as many as eight of the 11 statewide
measures on the general election ballot were in jeopardy because of
the legal tangle.
   Elections officials have said the financial effects statements
might be posted in voting booths as a substitute for having them on
the ballot or in the Voters' Pamphlet.
   The Supreme Court announced its unanimous decision Friday after
hearing oral arguments and had no further comment, saying written
opinions would be issued later.

<TEXT>
   An Ohio woman who sued a doctor and a hospital
because she gave birth to a healthy boy after undergoing an
unsuccessful abortion lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday.
   The justices left intact a ruling that barred Laura Harmath from
suing for the costs of rearing her child.
   She sued Dr. George Goler, who performed the abortion, and Mt.
Sinai Medical Center in Cleveland, where she had the operation in
September 1985.
   Ms. Harmath gave birth to her son, Jayson, the following March.
   She said Goler and the hospital were negligent and sought
$103,000 to pay for Jayson's upbringing until age 18. Ms. Harmath,
20 and single when she became pregnant, said having the child
created a heavy financial burden.
   An Ohio appeals court threw out the suit in 1988. The state
court said awarding damages in such cases would give parents ``a
windfall'' and could cause psychological harm to a child who later
discovers he or she was unwanted.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Bush
administration whether employers should be able to limit the number
of workers who join or serve in te military reserves.
   The court said it wants to hear what Justice Department lawyers
think about a ruling that struck down the Baltimore Police
Department's policy of limiting the number of employees allowed to
be in active reserve units.
   After hearing from the government lawyers, which could take
months, the court will decide whether to review the Baltimore
dispute.
   Although the court's action comes at a time when President Bush
has ordered tens of thousands of reservists to active duty in the
wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the Baltimore dispute
dates back to 1986.
   At issue is whether a federal law, the Veterans' Re-employment
Rights Act, gives employees an absolute right to join the reserves
and an absolute entitlement to a leave of absence to fulfill
reserve training obligations.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March ruled in the
Baltimore case that employers never may interfere with a worker's
joining, or serving in, the reserves.
   Other federal courts, however, have said employers need not
honor an employee's request for a leave to serve in the reserves if
the request is not reasonable.
   Lawyers for the Baltimore Police Department urged the justices
to resolve the conflicting rulings.

<HEAD>Paper Shortage Forces Partial Shutdown at Government Newspaper</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Parliament, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main national newspaper,
Izvestia, has missed publication the last two Sundays because of a
newsprint shortage, indicating the severity of the breakdown of
supplies to state enterprises.
   The government's flagship newspaper, a daily with a circulation
of 10.1 million, did not come out on Sept. 23 and Sept. 30, the
first such break since it began publishing seven days a week 10
years ago, managing editor Vasily Zakharo said Monday.
   The paper explained the breaks in publication Saturday in a
four-paragraph column headlined ``For the Enlightenment of
Readers,'' saying it hoped the breaks in publication would be the
last.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, using his newly granted
emergency powers, issued a decree last week ordering all companies
to fulfill their supply contracts with state enterprises,
ostensibly including newsprint. But it was unclear how effectively
the order could be enforced.
   Supplies of many products, ranging from food to newsprint and
other materials, have been increasingly hard to find as some
factories refuse to honor contracts with enterprises in other
republics or workers siphon off supplies for private sale.
   Zakharo also said Monday the newspaper's editorial board has
decided to cut back to six days a week on Jan. 1, 1991, to meet a
demand by mail carriers for a day off on Sunday. He insisted the
decision was unrelated to the paper shortage, but added the size of
the paper would not increase to make up for the lost day.
   Soviet mail service is miminal on Sundays, with the national
newspapers Izvestia and Pravda accounting for much of the delivery
work.

   For the first time in 34 years, retired
Justice William J. Brennan was not on the bench to begin a new
Supreme Court term Monday. But he was in the audience as his former
colleagues officially noted his departure.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist read an exchange of letters
between the eight court members and Brennan, its longtime leading
liberal.
   ``The personal warmth which you radiate has enriched all of our
lives,'' Rehnquist read from the letter to Brennan. ``We will miss
your wise counsel in our deliberations.''
   Brennan's reply, also read by the chief justice, said, ``My
reluctance to retire from the court was sharpened by an awareness
that I will no longer sit with each you on the bench or in the
conferences.
   ``I know that friendships forged in this court are sustained by
more than a common endeavor, and I therefore take comfort in the
expectation that our personal ties will endure in the years
ahead,'' Brennan wrote.
   Brennan, 84, retired in July because of failing health. He used
a cane to walk into the courtroom Monday and took a seat in a
section reserved for special guests.
   The seating arrangement of the other eight justices had been
changed to reflect their changed seniority. On the far right end of
the bench was an empty chair that will be filled soon by David H.
Souter, after his anticipated confirmation by the Senate on
Tuesday.

   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of the Soviet
general staff, was welcomed to the Pentagon with a 19-gun salute
Monday and told his hosts, ``We want every chance to get to know
America.''
   Moiseyev, who is the personal guest of Army Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will tour military bases in
five states before returning to the Pentagon on Friday for a news
conference.
   The Soviet general, who has been quoted as saying he is helping
the United States with data on Soviet weapons given Iraq, went
first to Powell's office for photographs.
   ``We've left a very good picture for the history books,'' the
Soviet general said as the flash units flared.
   Powell escorted Moiseyev to the office of Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney for a visit, then led him to the meeting room used by the
military chiefs for private talks.
   Following a private lunch, he helped lay a wreath at the Tomb of
the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery before beginning talks
on Capitol Hill with congressional leaders.
   Over the week Moiseyev, 51, will visit Army, Air Force, Navy and
Marine Corps units in New York, Michigan, South Dakota, California
and Colorado.
   Moiseyev, who is also first deputy minister of defense, is the
highest ranking Soviet military officer to visit the United States
since Soviet Marshall Sergei Akhromeyev met with Frank C. Carlucci,
then secretary of defense, in December 1987.
   The current visit is another sign of warming relations between
Washington and the government of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Moiseyev was appointed chief of the Soviet general staff
following Akhromeyev's retirement. He previously received public
attention by calling for improved technical training for officers
and improved military discipline.
   In an interview with the Washington Post immediately before his
departure for the United States, Moiseyev warned that a military
conflict in the Persian Gulf could escalate into world war and
urged the United States to seek a political solution under the
auspices of the United Nations.
   He predicted that in any conflict with the United States and its
allies, Iraq would be joined by its old enemy, Iran.
   And he said he was personally involved in assembling for the
United States information about Soviet weapons provided to Iraq.
   In the interview, Moiseyev also offered assurances that the
Kremlin has withdrawn nuclear warheads from regions of ethnic
unrest to ``a more secure place.''

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve will move quickly to lower
interest rates now that negotiators have reached agreement on a
deficit-cutting plan, many economists predicted Monday.
   But these analysts said the interest rate relief will be too
little and too late to avert a recession.
   This forecast was made on the eve of a key meeting Tuesday of
the Fed's top policy-making group, the Federal Open Market
Committee. The panel, composed of Fed board members in Washington
and Fed regional bank presidents, meets eight times a year to set
interest rate policies.
   President Bush told reporters Monday that he was looking for the
Fed to lower interest rates ``once they see that a sound budget
agreement has been put into effect.'' Bush and congressional
leaders have pledged to try to write the agreement into legislation
and enact it by Oct. 19.
   Many economists expected a vote at Tuesday's meeting to nudge
short-term interest rates down by about one-fourth of a percentage
point. The actual rate cut, they said, might come as early as next
week.
   Some economists said the rate cut would be enough to prompt
commercial banks to lower their benchmark prime lending rate from
10 percent to 9.5 percent, although there wasn't universal
agreement on this forecast.
   Analysts who expect a fairly prompt Fed easing move noted
numerous statements Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
made that the central bank stood ready to lower interest rates
following a credible, multiyear deficit reduction package.
   ``Greenspan has got to ease. If he doesn't, he is telling the
financial markets that he doesn't view the deficit agreement as
credible,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist with
DRI-McGraw Hill.
   Wyss said that if Congress showed evidence of moving quickly to
approve the budget agreement and the September unemployment report,
due out on Friday, showed a further rise in the jobless rate, then
the Fed would move perhaps as early as next week to cut the federal
funds rate from 8 percent to 7.75 percent.
   The Fed funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other
for overnight loans, is the bellwether rate the Fed often uses to
signal changes in its credit policies.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said while he
was looking for a quick rate cut on the Fed's part, markets should
not expect anything beyond a quarter of a percentage point drop,
given the inflationary pressures arising from a doubling of oil
prices since August when Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait.
   ``The Fed is being tossed back and forth by the Iraqi event,''
Sinai said. ``It wants to ease because of an impending recession
but aggressive easing is very hard to do as long as the inflation
threat is as great as it is.''
   David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer in New York, said regardless of
whether the Fed eases immediately or waits until Congress actually
passes the budget agreement, the rate cut will not be in time to
keep alive the current recovery, which has already lasted a
peacetime record of eight years.
   ``The handwriting is on the wall,'' Jones said. ``The Fed has
already waited too long if it had hoped to avoid a recession.''
   Jones and many other analysts believe the first economic
downturn since the 1981-82 slump will begin sometime in the final
three months of this year.
   While a number of analysts forecast a Fed easing move to support
a budget deal, this forecast was not universally shared.
   Jerry Jordan, chief economist of the First Interstate Bancorp of
Los Angeles, said it would be a mistake for the Fed to rush to
support the budget deal with lower interest rates.
   Jordan, one of a group of economists who monitor Fed actions as
part of the Shadow Open Market Committee, warned that Fed efforts
to ease rates ran the risk of allowing the higher inflation from
this year's oil shocks to become embedded in the economy.
   Many analysts who believe the Fed will begin to ease rates in
coming months said they looked for those rate cuts to accelerate
early next year once it becomes clear the country is in a
recession.
   Jones said the Fed will be forced next year to keep pushing
rates down because the banking system - which already faces heavy
losses from collapsing real estate markets - will move slower than
it has in the past to lower the cost of loans to businesses and
consumers in response to Fed easing moves.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday launched a 35-nation
meeting on how to facilitate the growth of freedom and the easing
of East-West tensions in Europe.
   Bush called on the foreign ministers to strengthen the European
Security Conference by giving it a permanent secretariat as well as
an elections office to supervise the exercise of voting rights in
Europe.
   Just before Bush opened the meeting, which is making
arrangements for a summit to be held in Paris Nov. 19-21, the Big
Four allies of World War II suspended their last controls over
Berlin.
   In a ceremony capped by a champagne toast, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Foreign Ministers Douglas Hurd of Britain,
Roland Dumas of France and Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet
Union turned over supervision of access to Berlin and the German
border to the Germans.
   Bush called it ``a moving moment,'' and said ``we really rejoice
with the German people.''
   East Germany will merge formally with West Germany, creating a
single, more powerful and prosperous nation at midnight Tuesday.
   Bush said unification is an expression of the human rights and
fundamental freedoms set down in the 1975 Helsinki agreement
produced by the European Security Conference.
   Depending on the decisions taken by the foreign ministers, the
Paris summit is expected to establish a new structure to bridge
East and West and also a treaty to cut U.S. and Soviet weapons in
Europe.
   Bush, after a meeting with Shevardnadze, said the Soviet
minister was confident the accord would be ready for signing in
Paris.
   ``I came out of the meeting encouraged also in asking for
flexibility so these negotiators can polish off the remaining
differences,'' Bush said.
   Baker and Shevardnadze made headway in two meetings last week
and will meet here again Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the administration gave its support to full
membership for the three Baltic republics and said Albania may be
allowed to participate as an observer.

<TEXT>
   As a result of Supreme Court action Monday, a
cable network is free to rebroadcast any part of a television
documentary about the internationally publicized custody battle
over little Hilary Foretich.
   The court left intact a ruling that said it would be unlawful
censorship to keep off the air a four-minute portion of the
telecast dealing with alleged sex abuse.
   Hilary, 8, was sent into hiding by her mother, Dr. Elizabeth
Morgan, after a judge said the girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich,
must be granted unsupervised visits with his daughter.
   Morgan spent two years in jail for refusing to obey the judge's
order and was freed only after Congress passed a law that limited
her incarceration.
   It was revealed last March that Hilary was living in New Zealand
under an assumed identity to avoid the visits with her father.
   The British Broadcasting Co. produced a documentary about the
case, entitled ``Hilary in Hiding,' that chronicled the girl's
odyssey with her maternal grandparents from northern Virginia to
England and then New Zealand.
   The documentary shows Hilary, then 4, talking to her mother in a
therapy session in which the child demonstrates with a doll alleged
sex abuse by her father. He repeatedly has denied abusing his
daughter.
   A lawyer representing Hilary sought to have banned any
rebroadcast of that four-minute segment.
   The film was shown in the United States several times last April
6 on the Lifetime Cable network.

   Despite nationwide casting calls for unknowns
to portray the late Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, a pair of
professionals were introduced Monday as stars for CBS' ``Lucy and
Desi: Before the Laughter.''
   Following auditions of ``a couple thousand'' Lucy lookalikes and
desiring Desis, producer Larry Thompson said he selected Frances
Fisher and Maurice Benard to play the famous husband and wife.
   Miss Fisher, who bears little resemblance to Miss Ball without
makeup, has appeared in the television movies ``Cold Sassy Tree,''
``Home'' and ``Broken Vows.''
   Benard, who plays Nico Kelly on the soap opera ``All My
Children,'' looks somewhat like a young Arnaz. He said he had a
conga that he was learning to play at home.
   ``There are a lot of talented people who wanted to be Lucy and
Desi,'' Thompson said of the search for the lead roles. ```I Love
Lucy' is more than a title.''
   The heavily publicized casting calls in Los Angeles, Miami and
New York, he said, were not a public-relations stunt but helped
``form what we were looking for.''
   He said one actor discovered in one of the calls will play a
band member in the film, due to be broadcast in February.
   Miss Fisher and Benard told reporters they were not concerned
about playing two of the best-kown actors in television history.
They added that they were not bothered by concerns about the CBS
project expressed by Lucie Arnaz, Lucy's and Desi's daughter.
   ``I'm very excited about playing a role as well-known as Lucy,''
Miss Fisher said. ``I saw that I could resemble her when I had
makeup on.''
   Said Benard: ``It's big shoes to fill. I'm an actor. I'm not an
impersonator. But he's a lot like my father.''
   The film, which is set to begin production on Monday, focuses on
the private life of Lucy and Desi in 1940 to the night they filmed
their first episode of ``I Love Lucy,'' which premiered Oct. 15,
1951.
   Thompson said he was close to signing another pair of actors to
play Fred and Ethel Mertz.

   Two descendants of a founder of Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. said Monday they want stop the giant company from buying
coffee grown in El Salvador in an effort to end that country's
civil war.
   ``The coffee growers benefit from the war,'' James Gamble said
at a news conference here. ``It produces ... a very cheap labor
force that cannot organize because of the civil strife.''
   But James Gamble and his brother Robert admit they have little
chance of winning their proxy fight at the company's stockholder
Oct. 9 meeting in Cincinnati.
   ``It was an accomplishment for us to get the resolution
officially on the ballot,'' James Gamble said. ``We don't have an
illusion of actually winning the vote, but if we're able to win 3
percent this year then the resolution stays on the ballot for next
year.''
   Salvadoran beans make up about 2 percent of the coffee used to
produce Procter &amp; Gamble's Folgers coffee.
   ``We could very easily replace the Salvadoran coffee with coffee
beans from other countries, but this isn't an economic decision for
us,'' said company spokesman Donald Tassone.
   ``As a company, we can't let a very small but vocal group inject
us into their dispute with the U.S. government, no matter how
well-intentioned it might be,'' he said.
   The White House has asked Procter &amp; Gamble to continue buying
the beans because of the importance of coffee sales to the
Salvadoran economy.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu called a 10-month-old
consumer boycott of some coffee that uses Salvadoran beans -
including Folgers - a ``misguided attempt to cripple the Salvadoran
economy'' that will ``do nothing to advance the peace process,
democracy or human rights.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble calls the conflict a dispute between peace
activists and U.S. foreign policy and would prefer not to get
involved.
   In a position paper distributed to shareholders, the company
noted that El Salvador's Roman Catholic bishops oppose the coffee
boycott because lost sales would hurt farmers and workers.
   James Gamble said Salvadoran landowners would be likely to
pressure their government to negotiate for peace if their sales to
a major client were on the line.
   The corporation, he said, ``could play a very critical role in
speeding up the negotiation process.''
   There is a total of 346,425,304 voting shares in Procter &amp;
Gamble - James Gamble, 27, owns 24,806 shares worth about $2
million; Robert Gamble, 30, said he wasn't sure how many shares he
controls.
   Both brothers said they had the support of their father and
other family members.
   They wouldn't say how much stock owned by other family members
would be voting their way next week, but conceded it would be less
than 1 percent of the total.

   The Supreme Court on Monday said it will hear
an appeal by a ship line that was sued for negligence by a
Washington state woman injured on a cruise to Mexico.
   The court said it will decide whether Carnival Cruise Lines may
be sued in federal court in the woman's home state.
   Eulala Shute and her husband, Russel, were taking a seven-day
cruise on the Tropicale from Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, when she fell during a guided tour of the ship's galley.
   The ship was in international waters off Mexico at the time.
   Carnival Cruise Lines, with headquarters in Miami, is a
Panamanian corporation. It said the passenger ticket agreement
signed by the Shutes required them to sue in Florida.
   A federal judge in Washington state dismissed the suit. But it
was revived by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February.
   The appeals court said Carnival's advertising and promotional
activities in Washington make it subject to a lawsuit there.
   The appeals court noted that the Shutes purchased their tickets
in Arlington, Wash., and that Carnival advertises in Washington
newspapers and provides brochures to travel agents there.
   The case is Carnival Cruise Lines vs. Shute, 89-1647.

   Road and rail traffic was
blocked in sections of Croatia on Monday after minority Serbs
proclaimed autonomy in the region and staged anti-government
rallies.
   ``The Serbian people must use all means to resist the terror of
the fascist (Croatian) government and to protect its human dignity
and civil and national rights,'' the Serbian National Council said
in a statement carried by the Tanjug news agency.
   The council, an unofficial body claiming to represent the
estimated 500,000 Serbs in Croatia, said the declaration was based
on an August referendum that showed near-unanimous support for
limited self-government. Croatian authorities declared the
referendum illegal.
   Yugoslav leaders plan to meet Tuesday to discuss the conflict in
Croatia, a northern state of about 5 million people, Belgrade
television reported.
   Belgrade radio reported barricades were set up early Monday
across roads and railway lines to Knin, a Serbian-dominated city of
about 10,000 people near the Adriatic coast. The blockades sealed
off traffic through much of western Croatia.
   Tension between Serbs and Croats, dating to the birth of
Yugoslavia in 1918, intensified earlier this year following the
first free elections in Croatia since 1945. The Serbs accuse the
newly elected authorities of discrimination.
   Croatian leaders claim the unrest has been orchestrated by the
Communist-ruled republic of Serbia to destabilize democracy in
Croatia and gain support for its hard-line policies.
   In Belgrade, more than 1,000 Serbs rallied Monday night. A few
thousand Serbs also gathered in Banski Grabovac, a village
southeast of Zagreb, around a flame-shaped monument honoring the
mainly Serbian partisans who fought the Croatian-led goverment
established by Nazis during World War II.
   Borisav Mikelic, head of a faction of the Croatian Socialist
Party, said Serbs cannot promise to halt attacks until authorities
stop ``revanchist detentions and arrests.''
   Last week, Serbs raided police armories in several towns and
seized automatic weapons.
   Hundreds of Serbs have reportedly taken refuge in an army
barracks in Petrinja, about 25 miles south of the Croatia'a capital
of Zagreb, to escape riot police seeking to recover weapons. At
least 27 people were detained in weekend clashes.
   An elderly Croat villager in Banski Grabovac said, ``We don't
mind the demonstration if it leads to peaceful solution of our
problems.'' He declined to give his name.
   There were no reports of violence at the rally.
   Also Monday, the largest opposition party in Serbia announced it
was ceasing all campaigning for upcoming elections, after a spate
of attacks on its members and disruptions of its rallies.
   ``If we do not receive immediate assurances from the Serbian
authorities that our people will not longer be the targets of
Communist hooligans, we will boycott the elections,'' said Vuk
Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Party. Elections are
scheduled for Dec. 9.
   President Borisav Jovic, a Serb now holding the annually
rotating chairmanship of Yugoslavia's collective presidency,
announced he would cut short his visit to the United Nations
``because of the deterioration of the political and security
situation'' at home, Tanjug said Sunday. There was no word on when
he was due to return.
   Croatia and Serbia are at odds over the future of Yugoslavia's
fragile, six-republic federation.
   Croatia wants the nation changed into a looser confederation of
sovereign states. Serbia seeks to maintain tighter central control,
and change its border with Croatia to incorporate Serbs living
there.

   Temple University on Monday renewed its
request for a court order ending a 27-day walkout by professors,
claiming it will have to cancel fall semester classes unless they
are back on the job by Tuesday.
   The 1,100-member union went on strike over pay Sept. 4 at the
private university, which has 30,000 students. Union members Sunday
night rejected the latest contract proposal by 372-62.
   Temple and union attorneys argued in court over whether the
professors should be ordered back. Temple officials have said if
pickets are still marching Tuesday, they will cancel 40 percent, or
1,900, of the 4,700 classes.
   Common Pleas Court Judge Samuel Lehrer said his response will
hinge in part on determining how serious a threat the strike poses
to the public.
   ``If it doesn't matter whether Temple goes out of business or
cancels classes, then there is no public danger,'' Lehrer said.
``But if it does matter and if there is a threat to the public,
then I must consider that.''
   Lehrer denied a union request that he throw out the university's
request for a back-to-work order. The hearing continued late in the
afternoon.
   Alaine Williams, attorney for the Temple Association of
University Professionals, said the university was trying to force
the judge's hand by threatening to cancel classes.
   But the judge replied, ``I think they have made a case and your
motion is denied.''
   Temple officials have said that if the strike continues, there
will not be enough time to make up lost class time before the
spring semester. Some 23,000 students are missing at least one
class and 6,000 have had no classes because of the walkout.
   Witnesses for the union argued that, even if the strike
continued, professors would be able to make up for lost class time
by extending the semester or scheduling extra class hours.
   ``It would be difficult, but we can work it out successfully,''
said Violet Kettles, of the English faculty.
   The proposal rejected Sunday included 5 percent raises in each
of four years and a requirement that professors contribute $260 a
year toward health coverage.
   The professors, whose salaries average about $45,500, want 7
percent raises and do not want to pay for health care.
   Some students have blocked city streets and stood outside a
courtroom, demanding an end to the dispute. Some have been arrested
for invading university President Peter J. Liacouras' office.
   ``We're very upset, we just want it over. Nobody is interested
in the students anymore. We're like pawns,'' said Rachel Smith, a
19-year-old sophomore from Margate, N.J. ``If I transfer I'm not
coming back.''

   President Bush said Monday that Iraq and
its leaders must be held liable for ``crimes of abuse and
destruction'' in the takeover of Kuwait. But he also suggested to
Baghdad that an unconditional military withdrawal could help speed
an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Bush, in a speech before the U.N. General Assembly, said all
nations hope that military force will not be required to drive Iraq
from Kuwait. Yet, he won applause by vowing anew that Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait ``will not be allowed to stand.''
   Praising the U.N.'s resolve, Bush said, ``This challenge is a
test we cannot afford to fail. I am confident we will prevail.''
   Even as Bush was speaking, the White House announced the United
States was sending two batteries of Patriot air-defense missiles to
Israel on an emergency basis.
   The weapons will help Israel defend against an increased threat
from ballistic missiles in Iraq, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Nearly every seat in the General Assembly hall was full as Bush
combined a blistering indictment of Iraq with an overture for
Baghdad to end the two-month old Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era, a
dark relic from a dark time,'' Bush said. ``It has plundered
Kuwait, it has terrorized innocent civilians, it has held even
diplomats hostage.''
   Aligning himself with remarks last week by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Bush said Iraq and its leaders ``must
be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction.''
   Bush met separately with Shevardnadze later to discuss the gulf
crisis, the plight of the Soviet economy and lagging arms control
talks. Emerging from the meeting, Bush said Shevardnadze was ``very
confident'' that a treaty between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to cut
U.S. and Soviet non-nuclear weapons would be ready for signing at a
35-nation summit in Paris.
   Bush said he was not as confident about completing a separate
accord with the Soviets to cut long-range nuclear missiles, bombers
and submarines by 30 percent. Bush had hoped to sign that treaty
during a trip to Moscow in December but said Shevardnadze talked
about completing the agreement early next year, if not by the end
of 1990.
   Shevardnadze praised Bush's speech as ``brilliant.''
   Aside from his hard-edged rhetoric, Bush appeared to try to
undercut Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's demand that his
territorial dispute with Kuwait be linked to Arab demands that
Israel give up territory lost by Syria and Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
   Bush said that ``I truly believe there may be opportunities'' to
settle the Arab-Israeli conflict and to build ``new arrangements''
among the states in the gulf - but only after Iraq makes an
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Saddam has suggested he would pull his troops out if the Arab
dispute with Israel is handled simultaneously.
   The United States has long been committed to a Mideast
settlement in which Israel would exchange territory for Arab
recognition of its right to exist.
   Bush said a military pullout by Saddam could clear the way for
Iraq and Kuwait to permanently settle their territorial
differences.
   ``And yet,'' Bush said, ``the world's key task - now, first and
always - must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be
tolerated or rewarded.''
   Later, talking with reporters, Bush said his comment about
``opportunities'' created by an Iraqi withdrawal did not mark any
change in policy and ``was not designed to convey flexibility or
shift in position.''
   He said he did not intend to suggest that Kuwait should make any
territorial concessions. ``You've got to make whole Kuwait the way
it was.''
   Bush also said it was possible that Saddam will make ``a
180-degree turn'' and pull out of Kuwait.
   However, the president said ``there would be great unease''
about a simple return to the pre-invasion status quo if it left
Saddam with a ``very troublesome capability'' of military power.
   ``The international community would have to have something to
say about that,'' Bush said. ``I'm sure that neighbors would want
to know that there was not a risk of another reckless invasion of
this nature.''
   In his speech, Bush did not mention his oft-stated demand that
the exiled emir of Kuwait be restored to power. Yet, he told
reporters later that the ``restoration of Kuwait's leaders is a
terribly important part'' of any settlement.
   Bush assured Saddam that ``we seek no advantages for ourselves''
in the gulf.
   He said the 165,000 U.S. troops defending the oilfields of Saudi
Arabia were sent there at the request of the Saudi government
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The American people - and this president - want every single
American soldier brought home as soon as the mission is
accomplished,'' he said.
   Bush praised the Soviet Union for collaborating with the United
States in a worldwide cutoff of trade with Iraq. The superpowers
``had indeed put four decades of history behind us,'' he said.
   More than ever before, Bush said, the United Nations is now ``a
center for international collective security.''
   Bush has met with more than 20 leaders here over the past three
days, and he said he was encouraged by reports that Saddam ``is
beginning to understand that it is him against the world.''
   Bush also said, ``There is more optimism in various quarters
that the sanctions are really beginning to bite hard.''
   Even so, U.S. officials said Sunday the two superpowers, as well
as a number of other countries, had begun preliminary drafting of
resolutions to authorize the use of force against Iraq if Saddam
does not withdraw his troops.

   An earthquake of moderate intensity
shook houses and buildings across Puerto Rico on Monday, but there
were no reports of injuries or damage.
   The quake registered 4.5 on the Richter scale and was centered
near the coastal city of Humacao, 30 miles southeast of San Juan,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo.
   The Seismological Survey in Cayey, Puerto Rico, said the temblor
struck at 2:36 p.m. EDT, lasted five seconds and was felt as far
away as St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 50 miles east of
Puerto Rico.
   It was strongest in Puerto Rico, particularly the San Juan
metropolitan area, said Allan Smith, director of the Seismological
Network of Puerto Rico at the University of Mayaguez.
   He said there were no reports of damage or injuries, but the
quake prompted a flurry of telephone calls to television and radio
stations.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage, while a 5 can cause considerable damage.

   The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider
reviving a libel lawsuit against Janet Malcolm, a staff writer for
The New Yorker magazine, by a psychologist who says she made up
quotes attributed to him.
   The justices will review a federal appeals court ruling that
last year threw out Jeffrey Masson's lawsuit. A decision is
expected by July.
   The appeals court ruling was criticized by some who said it
recognized ``the right to fake quotes.''
   Also Monday, the court let stand rulings in four other libel
cases:
   -It refused to kill a lawsuit stemming from advertisements
comparing Blue Cross and Blue Shield services to those of a health
industry competitor.
   A lower court ruling could send U.S. Healthcare's libel
allegations against Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a federal jury in
Philadelphia.
   -The justices turned down the appeal of a former San Jose City
Council member who won, and then lost, a $1.01 million libel award
against his local newspaper.
   The court let stand rulings that Claude Fletcher failed to prove
the San Jose Mercury News published statements about him with
``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless disregard of their
falsity.
   -It refused to revive libel suits by an unsuccessful mayoral
candidate in Willoughby, Ohio, against two newspapers that covered
controversy surrounding his campaign.
   Roland Mastandrea failed to prove his case against The Lake
County News-Herald and The Lake County Telegraph.
   -The justices killed a nine-year-old libel lawsuit stemming from
two leters to then-President Reagan opposing a North Carolina
man's appointment as a federal prosecutor.
   A federal appeals court dismissed the 1981 suit filed by David
Smith of Greensboro, N.C., against Robert McDonald, the operator of
child care centers in Virginia.
   In the lawsuit against Ms. Malcolm, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled that public figures who sue for libel over
allegedly altered quotes must show that the quotes are not even
``rational interpretations'' of what was said.
   The appeals court did not rule on whether Ms. Malcolm actually
fabricated quotes attributed to Masson, a former projects director
of the Sigmund Freud Archives.
   It instead said the fake quotes alleged by Masson, when compared
to what he contends he said, do not amount to actual malice.
   Ms. Malcolm's two-part article in The New Yorker focused on
Masson's struggle with other archives officials over Sigmund
Freud's abandonment of a theory that certain mental illnesses
originate in sexual abuse during childhood.
   The article discussed Masson's claim that his contract with the
archives was terminated because he made public his views that Freud
abandoned the theory simply to further his career and placate his
colleagues.
   The article subsequently was published in book form by Alfred A.
Knopf Inc. Masson's suit named The New Yorker and Knopf as
defendants also.

<HEAD>House Panel Rebuffs Arts Endowment Foes, Votes Fund Increase</HEAD>

   The House Appropriations Committee voted
Monday to boost spending by the National Endowment for the Arts to
$180 million next year and rebuffed attempts to abolish the agency
or impose new anti-obscenity curbs on the projects it subsidizes.
   The committee, in effect, ducked the politically explosive issue
of federal support for ``obscene art'' in favor of House floor
action later this week on a separate proposal to shift the
responsibility for deciding what is obscene from the NEA to the
courts.
   An NEA compromise being patched together by Reps. Pat Williams,
D-Mont., and E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., is tentatively scheduled for
floor debate starting Wednesday or Thursday.
   The pair circulated the outlines of a proposed compromise among
their House colleagues for comment Monday, but Williams said there
was no final agreement.
   Their proposal reportedly would extend the NEA's life for five
years and drop the strict obscenity ban Congress slapped on the
agency last fall at the request of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Instead, it would embrace a bipartisan Senate measure that would
require the NEA to get its money back from any grant recipient who
is convicted of violating obscenity laws. The guilty artist would
be barred from receiving any new federal grants for at least three
years.
   In a gesture to the NEA's congressional critics, the
Williams-Coleman compromise reportedly would include a modest
increase in the current 20 percent portion of federal funds
allocated to state arts agencies.
   The bill's new proposed 27.5 percent share for the states is far
less than the 60 percent originally proposed by the conservative
Coleman, who also had sought a ban on NEA support for any works
that violate the Supreme Court's obscenity standards.
   The $180 million the Appropriations Committee approved for the
beleaguered arts endowment would be a 5 percent increase in its
current $171 million budget.
   The NEA, an independent federal agency, spends most of the money
on grants to artists and arts institutions that mut be matched by
private funds.
   At the urging of Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., a staunch NEA
supporter, the committee resoundingly defeated by voice vote a
proposal by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, to eliminate all funds for the
endowment until Congress votes to extend its life in separate
legislation.
   ``Some people want to abolish the NEA, and this is what this
amendment is all about,'' Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., told his
colleagues. ``If you are for this amendment, you are for the end of
the National Endowment for the Arts,'' Yates said.
   Under heavy pressure from Yates and other committee Democrats,
Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, withdrew a proposed amendment that would
have banned subsidies for obscene or indecent works and required
the NEA to support art that is ``appropriate for a general
audience.''
   Democrats said Regula's proposal was so vaguely worded it could
not be enforced, and might be ruled unconstitutional on the ground
that it involved prior restraint on an artist's First Amendment
guarantees of freedom of expression.
   The committee bowed to pleas by Yates and Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., that it sidestep the ``obscene art'' issue in favor of
House action on a Williams-Coleman compromise later this week.
   The NEA's proposed $180 million spending budget for fiscal 1991,
which began Monday, was included in a $14.5 billion appropriations
bill for a variety of federal agencies, including the Interior and
Energy departments, the Forest Service and the Smithsonian
Institution.
   The committee approved the bill by voice vote and sent it to the
House floor.

   Budget negotiators agreed on a 1991 level of
military spending that pits President Bush and the Senate against
the House.
   ``Unbelievable,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior
member of the House Armed Services Committee, said Monday as
members closely examined the details of the broad plan that
includes tax increases and spending cuts.
   Defense spending authority in the fiscal year that began Monday
would total $289 billion in the compromise worked out by White
House and congressional bargainers.
   That was the same total proposed by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, earlier this year
and adopted by the full Senate in its version of the defense bill
in August.
   Although he originally proposed $307 billion in military
spending back in January, Bush accepted the $289 billion amount in
a speech this summer and the White House has endorsed the figure.
   The House last month approved a $283 billion defense bill that
would slash more than $2 billion from the Strategic Defense
Initiative, halt production of the B-2 bomber and cut troop
strength by 129,500.
   The Senate legislation would cut $1 billion from the SDI budget
and reduce U.S. troop strength by 100,000 but leave the B-2 stealth
bomber program intact.
   ``I think the defense numbers are reasonable and I certainly can
support those,'' Nunn said of the negotiators' agreement in an
interview Monday.
   Members of the House and Senate planned to meet Tuesday to begin
crafting a final defense package for fiscal 1991 from their two
widely divergent bills.
   House Democrats and Republicans on the Armed Services Committee
expressed the hope that lawmakers in their chamber would not give
in to the Senate and the administration.
   ``I really hope we don't retreat and stand our ground at $283
billion,'' said Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., who envisioned lawmakers
adding $6 billion of their pet projects to reach the higher number.
   ``They don't ever have any trouble ratcheting up. They'll find a
good cause,'' Hopkins said.
   Lawmakers also expressed concern over the absence of the cost of
Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. military deployment in the
Persian Gulf, from the budget compromise.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has estimated that the buildup
could cost about $15 billion in fiscal 1991.
   Schroeder suggested that the $6 billion difference between the
House and Senate numbers could be used for Operation Desert Shield.

again demanded Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait but held
out the possibility that a peaceful solution could usher in a new
era of stability for the Middle East.
   ``I think that it's main intention was seeking a solution in the

<HEAD>Legislation Would Upgrade Airport Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation Monday to upgrade
security at airlines and airports, including directing the
government to develop guidelines for warning passengers of
terrorist threats.
   ``Never again do we want a situation where the insiders had
notification but the rest of the world didn't,'' said Rep. Sherwood
Boehlert, R-N.Y. ``If in the future there is a credible threat,
there will be a mechanism for notification so that people can have
a choice.''
   The bill, approved on a voice vote without dissent, would put
into law the reforms recommended in May by a seven-member
presidential commission that investigated the 1988 bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The legislation would require the Justice Department and Federal
Aviation Administration to develop guidelines for notifying both
the public and airplane crews of bomb or other security threats.
   Airlines, airports and travel agents would be required to relay
any security threat immediately to government officials.
   The FAA also would be required to hire federal security managers
at high-risk domestic airports and foreign security liaisons at
those overseas. Airline and airport employees with access to
security areas would have to undergo background checks and new
training.
   To coordinate the activities, the legislation establishes a new
assistant secretary's position in the Transportation Department for
security and a similar new assistant administrator's post at the
FAA.
   It would provide the families of the victims aboard Pan Am 103
the same tax relief provided to families of government employees
aboard the flight, which exploded Dec. 21, 1988, killing a total of
270 people aboard and on the ground.
   The State Department would be required to negotiate agreements
with other nations to achieve the enhanced security measures at
foreign airports and domestic airlines would have to provide the
department with a passenger manifest within three hours after a
terrorist incident.
   The parts of the bill changing the State Department's airline
and airport security programs were approved last week by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Many of the measures already have been adopted by the
government; the Bush administration contends the legislation is not
needed.

   A two-year study of WIC operations in five
states showed Monday the supplemental feeding program can reduce
medical costs of caring for low-income pregnant women and their
babies.
   The study of the special supplemental food program for Women,
Infants and Children was ordered by Congress in 1987 to help
determine savings in Medicaid costs during the first 60 days after
birth.
   Typically, the WIC program provides improved nutrition for poor
women during pregnancy and for them and their infants after birth.
   From its beginning in 1972, the WIC program has grown to a $2.1
billion operation this year with an enrollment of 4.5 million women
and children. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that
covers medical costs of low-income people.
   The $1.1 million study was done for the department's Food and
Nutrition Service by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. of Princeton,
N.J.
   Department officials said the study ``strongly'' indicated that
WIC participation during pregnancy ``is associated with reduced
Medicaid costs and increased birth weight.''
   The study involved births and costs in Florida, Minnesota, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Texas over periods in 1987 and 1988.
   Among the findings were increased birth weights and reduced
Medicaid costs involving the women and their babies.
   However, the study cautioned that there are considerable
variations among the WIC and Medicaid programs operated by
individual states and that situations are changing rapidly.
   ``These problems are compounded by the exclusion of other
indigent care costs from the study, which means only a partial
picture of the health-care costs of low-income women and newborns
is available,'' it said.
   Even so, the benefits of WIC participation by Medicaid
recipients ``were so clearly demonstrated in all five study states,
with all their population and program differences'' that a
nationwide in 1987 would have shown positive benefits, the report
said.
   Looking to the future, researchers said Medicaid expansion is
allowing a higher-income group of pregnant women to enroll and that
many of those are likely to participate in WIC.
   ``Conversely, aggressive outreach and improved eligibility
procedures may bring a higher-risk group of pregnant women into the
Medicaid and the WIC programs,'' the report said. ``The net effect
of these enrollment changes on estimates of WIC benefits is
uncertain.''
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in a statement that
the study ``reaffirms the success of the WIC program and
underscores our emphasis on serving pregnant women and infants as
WIC's top priority.''
   Yeutter said that in 1974 as an assistant secretary of
agriculture he cut the ribbon launching the first WIC program
facility in Pineville, Ky.

<HEAD>Beirut Paper: Iran, Syria Agree on Plan to Free Western Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Beirut newspaper Ad-Diyar reported
Monday that presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hashemi Rafsanjani
of Iran have agreed on a step-by-step plan to free Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   The conservative daily, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, said
Assad worked out the accord in talks with Rafsanjani last week in
Tehran.
   Hours later, the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia,
announced it freed 40 Shiite Moslem detainees to mark the birthday
of the Prophet Mohammed, founder of Islam.
   Shiite kidnappers holding most of the 13 missing Westerners,
including six Americans, have repeatedly demanded the mainly
Christian South Lebanon Army free the 340 Moslems it holds in
exchange for releasing their captives.
   In New York, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the United States welcomes the move and said it is ``consistent
with our position that for humanitarian reasons, all persons being
detained without legal basis in the Middle East should be released
immediately.
   ``As President Bush has indicated, the release of American
hostages would help improve our relations with countries
contributing to that release.''
   Other Westerners held are four Britons, including Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite; two West Germans and an Italian. Most are
believed held by Shiite factions linked to the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God. It is Tehran's main ally in Lebanon.
   There was no way to assess the authenticity of the Ad-Diyar
report. The Iranian Embassy in Beirut and the headquarters of the
Syrian security force in the Lebanese capital's Moslem sector
declined comment.
   But the report came amid indications that efforts to free the
captives were gathering momentum amid the Persian Gulf crisis set
off by Iraq's Aug.2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Among the signals:
   -Iran's ambassador to Pakistan, a country used by the Americans
as a conduit into Tehran, said shortly before Assad's visit to
Tehran that some hostages could be freed soon.
   -Tehran and London restored relations last week, ending a
19-month rift.
   Ad-Diyar said the release process would begin not in Lebanon,
but in Iran, with Tehran's freeing British businessman Roger Cooper
``within the next few days to warm up the newly resumed diplomatic
ties between Britain and Iran.''
   Cooper has been in prison in Tehran since 1985 for allegedly
spying. Iran says he was convicted last year, but never disclosed
his sentence.
   Ad-Diyar said the next step would be release of British hostages
held by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in Lebanon ``in a matter of
days after Cooper's release.''
   The third stage was said to be starting serious negotiations for
releasing the six U.S. hostages simultaneously with unfreezing
Iranian assets held in the United States since 1979.
   Washington last month agreed to hand over assets worth at least
$200 million, and sources close to a U.S.-Iranian tribunal in The
Hague have said larger claims are nearing settlement.
   Most of the hostages have been held three years or more. The
longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The South Lebanon Army commander, retired Lebanese Army Gen.
Antoine Lahd, said Monday the 40 Shiites were freed specifically to
celebrate the prophet's birthday, an event traditionally marked in
Arab countries by freeing prisoners.
   Lahd told the Voice of the South radio station: ``I also took
into consideration their humanitarian condition.'' He did not
elaborate.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Budget Cuts May Axe `Point of Light'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England's first shelter for homeless veterans,
honored by President Bush as a ``point of light,'' faces possible
closure because of state budget cuts.
   ``To do this is unconscionable,'' Ken Smith, president of the
shelter, said Monday. ``These guys have already paid the price.''
   Officials of the financially strapped state said they were
considering closing the New England Shelter For Homeless Veterans
and one other homeless shelter in the Greater Boston area. That
could put nearly 400 people onto the streets.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn said Sunday he might sue state officials if
they do cut funds to the shelters.
   ``I believe it's a violation of the law to not provide
protection and help for needy people,'' Flynn said. ``By cutting
back these programs, they're leaving these people on the streets to
die.''
   Human Services Secretary Philip Johnston said he will meet with
Flynn this week to try to save shelter funding.
   ``We'll do everything possible to help,'' Johnston said. ``We'll
try to find cuts elsewhere to soften the impact on direct care.''
   Soldiers homes in Holyoke and Chelsea also are threatened.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced last week the state would
close the soldiers homes as part of a series of budget cuts as the
state struggles to balance its budget. Officials said the soldiers
homes could remain open if the Legislature can find equivalent cuts
elsewhere.
   Western Massachusetts lawmakers met Monday at the Holyoke
Soldiers Home and said they would fight a closing, tentatively set
for April 1.
   ``To even propose that this institution be closed is really
absolutely ridiculous so I'm confident that the governor will know
that we will fight him tooth and nail on this and that if he hasn't
gotten involved in a fight with western Massachusetts people
before, he's got one on his hands now,'' said state Rep. Carmen
Buell.
   The Boston veterans shelter opened in January and receives about
$70,000 a month from the state, which marks about 90 percent of its
budget.
   Smith said he was working on contingency plans, and trying to
get veterans organizations in the state ``to draw their wagons
around us.''
   Also, the veterans shelter was making an appeal to Bush for
help, Smith said, adding that the project received a ``point of
light'' award from the White House for community service.
   ``We're one of the thousand points of lights,'' Smith said.
``We'll see what that means.''
   Flynn called on gubernatorial candidates John R. Silber and
William F. Weld to announce whether they support cuts in homeless
services.
   ``If they do not support them, the cuts should not happen,''
Flynn said. ``There are only three months left in this
administration. The next governor will be taking office with
hundreds of people in the streets.''

<HEAD>France Recalls Vichy's Anti-Semitic Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acts of persecution and harsh anti-Semitism among
Nazi collaborators were relived and re-examined Monday, 50 years
after the start of a notorious crackdown that led to the deaths of
more than 73,000 French Jews.
   ``We must not blame the (Nazi) occupation for what was the sole
responsibility of the legitimate French government. The laws met
only utter silence from the French people,'' said former Justice
Minister Robert Badinter, who presided over the daylong symposium
on ``The Vichy Laws.''
   ``Vichy was obsessed with taking measures against Jews,''
Badinter told about 250 people at the conference.
   ``The Vichy Laws,'' named for the Vichy Government that
controlled unoccupied France and territories from 1940 to 1943,
prevented France's 350,000 Jews from holding public office,
teaching, attending university, owning stores and working in the
media. It was implemented 11 weeks after Paris fell to the Germans.
   The laws, later reinforced by measures to send Jews to
concentration camps, defined ``who is a Jew,'' using criteria far
more sweeping than the racial laws drafted by the Nazis.
   Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld estimated 3,000 Jews died from cold
and starvation from 1940 to 1942 in French-run camps ``where there
wasn't a single German soldier.''
   In all, 76,000 Jews were deported to death camps from France.
About 2,500 survived, historians estimate.
   ``The Jewish Laws did not come out of the blue because
anti-Semitism existed in France well before the German victory in
June 1940,'' said Henri Amouroux, a historian at the symposium,
sponsored by the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation and
the Sons and Daughters of Jews Deported from the France.
   ``Anti-Semitism developed in the 1930s in a climate of economic
and social crisis. Thousands of Jews, chased out of Poland and
Austria, fleeing the Nazis, came to France and were accused of
taking jobs,'' he said.
   Historians say the Vichy laws were a cornerstone of a right-wing
ideology that sought to undo the liberalizing, human
rights-oriented reforms of the French Revolution.
   ``The laws erased the advances made during the Age of
Enlightenment,'' said Zev Sternhell, a history professor at the
University of Jerusalem. ``They reflect a new concept of the
nation, not as a melting pot but as an extended family with
everybody having the same blood.''
   For historian Denis Peschansky, the laws were a way for Marshal
Philippe Petain, Vichy's leader, to explain the French military
defeat and punish those deemed responsible.
   ``Petain had to find reasons within French society for the
debacle - he certainly couldn't blame the army because it was in
power - so he blamed the Jews, Communists, Freemasons and other
foreigners,'' Peschansky said.
   The laws also revoked the citizenship of about 400,000 Jews in
colonial Algeria and Morocco and Tunisia, which were French
protectorates.
   ``My mother, who had six small children and worked in the
arsenal in Algiers, was fired immediately,'' said a woman in the
audience.
   Other survivors described the discrimination and persecution
that followed.
   In September 1943, Samuel and Rachel Ewenczyk closed their dry
goods store in Grenoble, fleeing to the Alps to escape deportation.
   ``One week later, thanks to the Vichy laws, the French police
requisitioned the store as a Jewish store, and sold it to a
non-Jewish person,'' Mrs. Ewenczyk, 78, recalled.
   After Grenoble was liberated by U.S. troops in August 1944, the
family returned to claim the property.
   ``The man in the shop protested, saying he had bought the shop,
but my husband asked, `Who did you buy it from? I never sold it.'
We were back in business a week later,'' she said.
   The Vichy government, named for a city in central France, was
never recognized by the Allies. The Nazis annulled the armistice
with Vichy after the Allies invaded North Africa in November 1943
and occupied France.

   Federal regulators said Monday they had
transferred most offices of the Phoenix-based Merabank to Bank of
America, estimating the bailout of the thrift - once Arizona's
largest - at $1 billion.
   Bank of America Arizona, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based
holding company, is taking over Merabank's 66 Arizona branches, the
Resolution Trust Corp. said.
   The agency will keep Merabank's seven Texas branches and try to
sell them as part of Merabank Texas - a separate institution
created lout of three small thrifts by the RTC's
predecessor, the Federin 1988 in a baial Home Loan Bank Board.
   The deal with Bank of America brings the RTC's ``resolution''
total to 287 since its creation in Aug. 1989. It still has another
207 institutions left to handle and several hundred others are
expected to fail in the next year.
   Bank of America is assuming only $552 million of Merabank's $5
billion assets, leaving the RTC with the rest. Even the $552
million are being acquired with liberal rights to return the assets
to the RTC if they prove to be worth less than originally
estimated.
   The bank is paying a premium of $92.3 million to take over $3.5
billion in deposits in Merabank's Arizona offices.

   It's a jungle out there on the streets of
suburban Lisle.
   So village officials have hired four Brookfield Zoo police
officers to slam the brakes on motorists speeding through the city
and trying to escape the crowded highways that bisect the
community.
   Lisle Police Chief Harold Fitzsimmons hired the four as
part-time community service officers in February. Armed with city
police vehicles and radar guns, the officers have issued almost
1,000 tickets to motorists speeding down Lisle's residential
streets.
   Fitzsimmons indicated he chose the zoo officers because they
knew how to soothe an angry motorist's temper.
   ``These guys know how to interact with people. The paid visitor
comes to the zoo for a pleasant visit, and the officers are there
mostly to help them out,'' Fitzsimmons explained in a telephone
interview from the suburb, which is about 10 miles west of Chicago.
   Such skills are useful while patrolling Lisle's streets, the zoo
officers said. Although the Brookfield officers graduated from the
same police academy that trained Lisle's 25 regular patrol
officers, they don't carry guns or make arrests while on patrol.
   ``I see how people are always in a hurry and they always have an
excuse. On a residential street, there's no reason to be doing 14
or 15 miles an hour over the speed limit,'' said Lee Zeitlin, one
of the four zoo officers.
   Fitzsimmons said that under the suburb's program, motorists
cited by Zeitlin and his colleagues face a $25 fine, rather than
the minimum $50 fine mandated by the state. Most motorists choose
to pay the fine, which goes directly to Lisle because drivers are
cited for violating village laws, not state traffic regulations.
   If the motorist pays the fine, city officials don't report the
violation to the county clerk and the violation never appears on
the driver's record, Fitzsimmons noted.
   As a result, not everyone is sold on the traffic program.
   DuPage County Circuit Clerk John Cockell said Monday that the
city's traffic enforcement program may violate state laws.
   ``I think they're jumping around the law,'' Cockrell said.
   ``All traffic citations must be reported to the circuit court
within 48 hours. That's the law. If they're not doing that, they've
got a problem,'' he said.
   Bob Kay, village attorney, said city officials are trying to
determine whether the program complies with state law.

   Energy Department officials raised more
questions than they answered Monday about whether an Ohio atomic
weapons facility would permanently stop producing uranium and shift
to cleaning up decades of radioactive wastes.
   Henson Moore, the department's deputy secretary, first announced
during a briefing with reporters that a decision had been made to
``never produce (uranium) again'' at the Fernald plant near
Cincinnati.
   Instead, he said, the plant would concentrate on cleanup and
development of cleanup technologies that also might be used at
other weapons facilities with contamination problems.
   Within hours, however, a department spokesman disavowed Moore's
characterization and said no decision on production would be made
until January. The department said that management at Fernald had
been shifted to the DOE office in charge of cleanup activities.
   The plant, which faces a major cleanup problem from past lax
production procedures, has not produced weapons grade uranium since
July 1989. The 1,000 plant employees have been awaiting word on
whether production would ever resume.
   Some fear a shift away from production eventually would shut
down the facility.
   Moore raised the issue of uranium production at Fernald in
opening remarks at a briefing with reporters, saying he had wanted
to take the opportunity to disclose that Energy Secretary James
Watkins had decided ``making permanent what has been de facto for
about a year.''
   ``It (Fernald) will never produce (uranium) again,'' Moore said.
   Although not contesting what Moore had said, department
spokesmen later said an actual decision by the department on the
production question at Fernald is not expected to be made until
January.
   ``We're probably on the road to closing down production,'' said
department spokesman Bill Griffin. ``The decision will be made in
January whether to at any point resume production or permanently
turn the facility over to a cleanup mode.''
   Dan D'Armond, a spokesman for Moore, later also acknowledged
that a decision on the production issue at Fernald ``is not
completely finalized'' but said the department was ``planning'' to
stop uranium production at the Ohio facility.
   Uranium production has been suspended since July 1989 because of
the facilities environmental problems including widespread
contamination as a result of past lax production practices.
   Moore said he didn't anticipate that a permanent halt in
production would cause job losses at Fernald. Instead the work at
the 1,000-acre complex 18 miles from Cincinnati would focus
exclusively on cleanup, safely packaging contaminated materials and
developing new cleanup technologies, he said.
   The Fernald plant was opened in 1951 to process uranium for
atomic weapons. The cost of cleaning up hazardous materials at the
plant has been estimated at $1 billion to $5 billion.
   Stored at the plant are more than 500,000 metric tons of
radioactive wastes dating from current plant operations to the
World War II-era Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb.
   Meanwhile, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the decision to shift
management authority from DOE's production side to the cleanup
offices was a major step toward ending uranium production Fernald
and should trigger a retraining program for workers.
   ``According to my legislation which was passed last year, the
end of Fernald's production mission requires DOE to have a job
retraining plan for existing workers,'' Glenn said through his
press office.

<HEAD>Israel to Distribute Gas Masks to 4 Million Residents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel will start distributing gas masks to its
entire population of 4.7 million citizens next week following Iraqi
threats to attack the Jewish state with chemical weapons, the army
announced Monday.
   Each kit contains a gas mask, a syringe with a nerve gas
antidote and purifying powder. Instructions will be in Hebrew,
Arabic, English and Russian.
   The announcement followed assessments of an increased threat of
war in the Persian Gulf and foreign reports suggesting that Israel
has decided to absorb Iraq's possible first strike without taking
preemptive action.
   Distribution was advanced by two months and ended a heated
public debate. Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said Sunday it
was originally planned to issue gas masks in December.
   Officials had feared an immediate distribution of gas masks
could panic the Israelis or send Iraq an incorrect message that
Israel planned an attack.
   The army sought to allay public concern, saying ``distribution
of gas masks in no way whatsoever constitutes a change to an
emergency status.''
   ``The purpose . . . is to transfer the kits to citizens' homes
to shorten the time of distribution, should a need arise.''
   Army spokesman Brig. Gen . Nachman Shai maintained the
distribution plan was developed long before the gulf crisis, and
other officials say Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is unlikely to
attack Israel, but that his actions are unpredictable.
   The spokesman said sealed gas mask kits will be distributed next
week in three towns in the center of Israel, the Negev desert and
the north. Starting Oct. 15, kits will be handed out at schools
throughout Israel, beginning with cities and expanding to rural
areas.
   Distribution announcements have gone to one-third of Israelis
living in towns, Israel radio said. Shai estimated the overall
distribution will take weeks.
   Shai said foreign residents also will get masks, and masks would
be available for tourists at hotels. He expressed hope the army's
decision would not deter foreigners from visiting.
   The spokesman said 140,000 Arabs living in the annexed east
Jerusalem will be issued gas masks.
   He said purchase of the kits has begun for the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but they
will have to pay the $100-plus cost because they are not covered by
Israeli national insurance.
   Shai said the public will be ordered to keep the kits sealed
under threat of legal punishment. Special sirens are supposed to
sound a chemical attack warning, he said.
   Experts have said Israel could have little warning of attack.
Zeev Eitan, a military analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffe
Center for Strategic Studies, said Israel could get a six-minute
early warning if it got immediate data from U.S. spy satellites.
   Debate about distributing gas masks began in April, when Saddam
threatened to hit Israel with binary chemical weapons and ``make
fire eat half of Israel'' in retaliation for an Israeli nuclear
attack.
   Israel in 1981 bombed a nuclear reactor near Baghdad, saying
Iraq was using it to develop weapons.
   Saddam's threats intensified after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   But Shai insisted, ``There is no urgency in the distribution
now. We don't have any actual information stating, God forbid, that
hostilities will start tonight or tomorrow or in a week or two.''
   Still, signs of public anxiety emerged minutes after the army
announcement.
   ``I never thought that would happen. When I heard it today, my
first thought was, oh my God, this is not a joke,'' said Margo
Iyoun, a 29-year-old immigrant from Orinda, Calif.
   ``Coming and living in Israel, that for me was an idealistic
thing. But it's hard to leave anything on the level of idealism
when you have a child.''
   The only previous distribution of gas masks was experimental. It
was conducted 1{ years ago in two towns and was declared successful
after the army found the population kept the kits in good shape.

   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a
$1 million legal fee that the seller of a Louisiana television
station was ordered to pay in a breach-of-contract case.
   The court said it will examine the power of federal judges to
order such payments.
   The case stems from a 1983 agreement in which NASCO Inc., a
Tennessee company, signed a contract to buy KPLC-TV in Lake
Charles, La., for $18 million from G. Russell Chambers.
   NASCO later sued, accusing Chambers of breaking the contract.
   A federal judge ruled that Chambers acted in bad faith in
conducting his defense in the suit and in 1989 ordered Chambers to
pay about $1 million in legal fees to NASCO.
   The ruling was upheld in February by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Chambers said Louisiana
state law provided no basis for the attorney fee award. He said the
award was unreasonable and violated his rights.
   The case is Chambers vs. NASCO, 90-256.

<HEAD>New Nursing Home Requirements in Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New requirements to improve the quality of
nursing home care went into effect Monday, but nursing home owners
say they will have trouble complying without adequate state funding
or implementing regulations.
   The comprehensive nursing home reforms were passed by Congress
in 1987, setting requirements for nursing homes to follow to
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
   Those include provisions on quality of living conditions, access
to social activities, accommodation of personal needs, assessments
for health care services, protection of residents' personal funds
and privacy.
   Other provisions require confidentiality of medical records,
limitations on the use of physical and chemical restraints, choice
of personal attending physicians and access to telephones.
   Some of the regulations to implement the new requirements are in
place, but nursing home owners have complained that regulations for
critical provisions of the law have not been issued.
   Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care Financing Administration,
which handles Medicare and Medicaid, said the majority of the
regulations were in place and those that aren't yet final soon will
be.
   ``States, consumer groups and nursing home industry groups have
been consulted and have been fully informed of the new requirements
as we have developed and issued guidelines, instructions and
regulations during the past three years,'' she said.
   In a petition to the Department of Health and Human Services,
the American Health Care Association said many states have not
allocated adequate funds to implement the law.
   The association, representing 10,000 nursing homes, asked
Wilensky's agency to issue regulatory guidance to the states
outlining what actions the federal government will take to ensure
that state plans are funded.

<HEAD>McDonald's Nearly Doubles Price of a Big Mac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feasting on a Big Mac is going to take even a
bigger bite out of Soviet wallets.
   McDonald's has nearly doubled the price of the two-patty
hamburger in Moscow, where a meal at the restaurant has become
``practically unaffordable for the average Soviet citizen,'' the
government newspaper Izvestia reported Monday.
   The price hike to 6.95 rubles - more than four hours' pay for
the average Soviet worker - was attributed to the rising cost of
meat, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast-food chain has been serving more
than 1 million customers a month in Moscow since the restuarant
opened in January. Previously, a Big Mac cost 3.75 rubles.
   Restaurants in state hotels charge 2 to 3 rubles for an entree,
while private restaurants may demand up to 50 rubles. The exchange
rate for rubles varies greatly.
   In Chicago, near McDonald's headquarters, a Big Mac costs $1.95.
Officials at McDonald's headquarters could not be reached for
comment.
   The price-hike decision was made by the board of the joint
Soviet-Canadian McDonald's venture after the Soviet government
announced it was increasing prices for meat and other products this
month, according to M. Tulupnikova, business manager of the Moscow
McDonald's, the world's largest.
   The ingredients are produced locally at a $50 million factory
built by McDonald's of Canada.
   The newspaper said the line at the restaurant wasn't noticably
smaller Monday because of the price increase.
   During the summer, some customers waited up to 90 minutes to
reach the counter.
   Last month, the official Tass news agency reported that ``it
would be wrong to say that all Muscovites are satisfied with
McDonald's.''
   ``Some are deterred by high prices,'' it said. ``Visitors spend,
on average, about 10 rubles in the shop. For many, this is much
more than their daily pay.''
   McDonald's plans to build 19 more restaurants in the Soviet
capital.

<HEAD>She Sells Sea Shells, So Why Not Gatorade?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If she sells sea shells by the seashore, so
will corporate America.
   Targeting Los Angeles County's big beachgoing crowd, advertisers
are slapping their messages on trash barrels, phone booths, tide
charts and county beach vehicles.
   The wave of ads could swell with a law passed last week in
Sacramento that generally expands advertisers' access to the coast.
   ``It's not as if we're trying to sell every square inch of
beach,'' said Dusty Brogan, who oversees marketing for the county's
beaches. ``Everything has to be harmonious with the surroundings.
We'd never permit something like free-standing billboards.''
   The county is considering the sale of ad space on bicycle racks
and benches to a swimwear maker and wants to post oversized
thermometers, underwritten by advertisers, on lifeguard towers.
   Officials say the advertising will raise much-needed funds for
the upkeep of 31 miles of Los Angeles County beach property. The
beaches, which cost about $17 million to maintain and patrol,
operate at an annual deficit of about $7 million.
   The county could eventually bring in up to $4 million in
additional yearly revenue from various beach marketing programs,
Brogan said.
   ``How else are we going to keep services up?'' she asked.
``Where do we go?''
   The Board of Supervisors must approve each facet of the program.
The ad expansion also is being closely watched by environmental
groups.
   ``In Los Angeles, going to the beach is the closest many people
come to a natural environment,'' said Peter Saundry, chairman of
the Sierra Club's regional Clean Coastal Waters Task Force.
   ``It's of concern to us any time advertisers show up on the
beach. But we realize the county is in a tricky situation,'' he
said. ``Environmental groups like ours are pushing them to clean up
the beaches, but those things do cost money.''
   The new law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, broadens the
authority of counties to sell ad space and license their property.
Los Angeles County is considering licensing a clothing line similar
to that worn by lifeguards.
   Companies that have tried beach ads include the maker of
Gatorade sports drink, who paid the county $12,500 to place clocks
featuring the Gatorade logo on 120 lifeguard towers this year.
   ``If the ad is relevant to what someone is doing, thinking or
buying at the beach, it makes a lot of sense,'' said advertising
executive Alan Pando, president of DDB Needham West.
   ``But it would be too bad if the beach ended up looking like
NASCAR,'' he added, referring to the car racing circuit featuring
autos plastered with sponsors' logos.
   Longtime lifeguard Larry Kraus is philosophical about the ad
blitz.
   ``Look at all this graffiti,'' he said, pointing to a lifeguard
tower at Venice Beach. ``On the scale of things that bother you at
the beach, advertising is very low.''

   Five senators criticized the Bush
administration Monday for refusing to give them documents on South
Korea's plan to buy 120 F-A-18 jet fighters and components in a
$4.7 billion deal.
   Democratic Sens. Alan Dixon of Illinois and Wendell Ford of
Kentucky told reporters they plan to introduce legislation
requiring President Bush to give House and Senate leaders documents
related to the U.S.-South Korean deal worked out last year.
   ``To intelligently exercise our constitutional authority, we
must be able to see and read the documents involved in this
transaction with South Korea,'' the lawmakers said in a letter to
their colleagues.
   Joining Dixon and Ford were Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., and John Heinz, R-Pa.
   Under the arrangement, the South Koreans will buy 12 of the
aircraft from U.S. production lines, will be provided with kits for
36 aircraft that will be assembled in Korea and have licensing
agreements allowing 72 aircraft to be produced in Korea.
   The agreement has been a matter of dispute for some months in
Congress, particularly among members who wanted more of the
U.S.-produced aircraft to be included in the deal.
   But the arrangement also provides for modernizing South Korea's
aging air fleet of F-4s and F-5s, and increases its military
alignment with the U.S. forces.
   The primary contractor of the F-A-18 ``Hornet'' is McDonnell
Douglas Corp. of St. Louis, Mo.

<HEAD>Peter Boyle in Fair Condition After Apparent ``Mild Stroke''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Peter Boyle was in fair condition at
a hospital Monday after apparently suffering a mild stroke,
hospital officials said.
   Boyle, 54, was expected to remain at the University of Utah
Health Sciences Center for several days to undergo tests, hospital
spokesman John Dwan said.
   Boyle was admitted to the hospital at Sunday after experiencing
what a nursing supervisor described as ``mild weakness and a
headache.''
   ``It was a mild stroke,'' nursing supervisor Charlene Barrett
said. ``His blood pressure was up, so we're giving him medicine for
that.''
   Boyle was in Salt Lake to film ``Rubin and Ed,'' a comedy
produced by the British Working Title Productions, said Doug
Lindeman, a Los Angeles-based spokesman for the company.
   Lindeman said Boyle and the rest of the company had been
preparing to go to Hanksville, in southeastern Utah, to begin ``an
intense stretch in the desert'' when Boyle became ill.
   Boyle was nominated for a 1989 Emmy as guest actor in the
television drama series, ``Midnight Caller.''
   His film credits include ``Young Frankenstein,'' ``Joe,'' ``Taxi
Driver,'' ``F.I.S.T.,'' the ``Dream Team,'' and most recently,
``Speed Zone,'' opposite comedian John Candy.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo's been called a lot of names in
his political lifetime but on Monday he was given a bodacious new
one: ``your honorable dudeship.''
   The title was bestowed on him by a three-fingered, mutant
amphibian named Michelangelo, one of the rock-singing Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   The occasion was the start of the State Division of Substance
Abuse's drug prevention program featuring the pizza-loving turtles
at P.S. 33 in Manhattan.
   ``Anybody here know the Ninja Turtles?'' the governor asked a
gymnasium filled with squealing first, second and third graders.
The deafening, affirmative response prompted Cuomo to quip:
   ``Man, I hope they don't run for office.''
   He then gave a high fived to turtle-member Donatello before the
group performed their anti-drug song, ``Walk Straight.''
   ``Hey, your honorable dudeship,'' Michelangelo said, looking
around for Cuomo, ``we're gonna work together to beat this drug
thing.''
   The popular television turtles, who recently launched a singing
career complete with a national tour and a show at Radio City,
offered to help with the state's drug prevention campaign because
``they wanted to do something positive, give kids a positive
message,'' said Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the Division of
Substance Abuse.
   Cuomo said he personally thanked the turtles - Michelangelo,
Leonardo, Donatello and Raphael - for their help. ``It's really a
selfless thing for them to be doing this.''
   Then the Italian-American governor added, ``And I love their
names.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran President Proposes Truce With Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani on
Monday proposed a cease-fire with leftist rebels in a bid to
improve the atmosphere for peace talks.
   The truce would take effect as soon as the guerrillas declare a
reciprocal cease-fire, Cristiani said in a speech to the General
Assembly.
   ``Peace in El Salvador will not come out of the muzzle of any
rifle,'' Cristiani said. ``There is no reason for war in El
Salvador. We do not want war.''
   The fifth round of U.N.-mediated peace talks between the
government and rebels ended in a stalemate Sept. 18.
   Cristiani, who took office June 1989, also pledged to end abuses
in the Salvadoran armed forces. The military has been linked to
``death squad'' activity against peasants and labor activists
suspected of liberal or leftist tendencies, human rights observers
say.
   A cease-fire arranged last year collapsed after several union
halls were attacked and labor organizers were slain.
   The rebels blamed the killings on the government, and launched
an offensive on the capital of San Salvador.
   Last November, during the height of the guerrilla attacks, men
dressed in army uniforms killed six Jesuit priests who had
criticized government policy. Their cook and her daughter were also
slain.
   Cristiani said his government was not involved in the Jesuit
slayings, but an army unit has been identified as being
responsible.
   In late 1989, a U.N. human rights report said Cristiani's
government presided over a ``resurgence of torture'' that included
sexual abuse and beatings of prisoners, and executions of political
opponents.
   The annual report by Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo, a special
representative of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, criticized
both the government and leftist rebels.
   Pastor blamed the rebels for assassinating alleged collaborators
with the armed forces, among others.
   Salvadoran authorities said the claims of torture were part of a
campaign by the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Movement.
   The United States has heavily subsidized the Salvadoran
government during the 11-year civil war, currently spending about
$1 million daily in foreign and military aid.
   The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, however, is
considering a bill to withhold half of the U.S. military aid to El
Salvador for a year in retaliation for the slayings of the Jesuits
and other abuses by the army.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts Force Independence Park to Shut Down 8 Buildings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekend budget agreement in Washington
headed off federal spending slahes, but eight buildings at
Independence National Historic Park closed Monday to save money
anyway.
   ``We knew in March that we were looking at a possible shortfall
in the range of $850,000,'' said Bernard Goodman, assistant park
superintendent. ``We began reducing our hires of guides,
substituting temporary workers who were hired through the month of
September.''
   The tight budget is expected to last through the fiscal year, so
the buildings may not reopen until next October, Goodman said.
   Closed were Old City Hall, the home of the U.S. Supreme Court
from 1791 to 1800; the reconstructed Graff House where Thomas
Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence; the 2nd Bank of
the U.S.; Pemberton House, which houses artifacts of the Army and
Navy; New Hall, a museum dedicated to the Marine Corps; the Todd
House, a refurnished Quaker home where Dolly Todd, better known as
Dolly Madison from a later marriage, lived; and the Bishop White
house, a refurnished historic house.
   Also, about 30 temporary guides were fired, according to
Goodman.
   Goodman said more of the park's 19 historic buildings may be
closed. He didn't say which ones.
   ``We chose this particular group because they are lesser-used
buildings in the park,'' he said. ``We have decided that under no
circumstances will we close Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell
Pavilion or the Park Visitor Center.''
   During 1989, Goodman said, attendance at the now-closed sites
ranged from 12,869 at the Bishop White House to 140,036 at the 2nd
Bank of the U.S. By contrast, more than 1,400,000 people visited
the Liberty Bell pavilion last year, he said.
   A spokesman for the National Park Service said parks across the
country are squeezed for funds and many can cut back on such things
as lawn-mowing. The Philadelphia park doesn't have that
flexibility, he said.
   Goodman said Monday's actions had nothing to do with the
Graham-Rudman budget balancing law, which would have forced
across-the-board cuts in federal spending and even more cutbacks
here and at other parks. Those cuts were averted by the Sunday
budget agreement in Washington, D.C.
   In Washington, park system spokesman Duncan Morrow said all of
the national parks are acutely aware that government spending must
be kept under control. The only difference is that the cutbacks at
Independence National Historic Park may be ``a little more
dramatic'' because about the only way to save is to close down
buildings.
   ``Plenty of parks have to shorten hours at various facilities,
close them on certain days a week or reduce their maintenance
schedule,'' he said.
   ``But at Independence Hall, cutting back on maintenance is
different from cutting back on lawn mowing at some of our other
parks. When you cut back on maintaining a historic structure, it
has a snowballing effect and the rate of decline accelerates
rapidly - particulary in the face of heavy public use.''

   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas on Monday dismissed
Iraq's release of nine French hostages as insignificant but
suggested Baghdad may be softening its line in the gulf crisis.
   On Sunday, Saddam complimented President Francois Mitterrand for
offering positive ideas to resolve the crisis and called for
replacing the language of ``threats and warnings'' with dialogue.
   In an interview from the United Nations, Dumas told the French
television network La Cinq: ``We are obliged to say that no gesture
has yet come from Iraq that modifies the basic problems. We simply
note a change in tone.''
   But he added, ``This change in tone could be a prelude to a
change in attitude. The coming days will show us.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced Monday he would free
nine French hostages held at strategic locations throughout his
country.
   ``It's good news that changes nothing,'' Dumas said.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Hussein released
the nine Frenchmen as part of a ``humanitarian gesture.''
   In a speech to the United nations last week, Mitterrand
suggested settling the conflict over Kuwait together with other
regional problems.
   Dumas noted the positions of the French and American leaders
``are very close.''
   Bush denounced Iraq on Monday for plundering Kuwait but
suggested an Iraqi withdrawal could spur talks on Arabs'
territorial grievances with Israel.

<TEXT>
   A Police Department report on how to deal with
the city's crime wave is due on Mayor David Dinkins' desk, and
officials said Monday the mayor will call for a tax on every
paycheck earned in the city to help fund it.
   Under the fixed-rate tax, someone earning $50,000 a year would
pay $50 in the first year and $75 in subsequent years, and
employers would have to match their employees' payments, said a
City Hall source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Albany, Gov. Mario Cuomo was non-committal about whether the
Legislature would approve the tax plan.
   ``We'll know quickly ... if there's any interest in doing it,
because it's an election year,'' Cuomo said.
   Republican Sen. Nicholas A. Spano said he would try to organize
opposition to the tax.
   ``At a time when suburbanites' property taxes are already a
burden and their own municipal services are strained, it's unfair
to expect them to pay for more of New York City's needs,'' he said.
   The Police Department report, due on the mayor's desk Monday
night, is expected to shape the city's response to a flurry of
violent, highly publicized street crimes.
   Dinkins said he would discuss the report with Police
Commissioner Lee Brown on Tuesday, when he also is expected to
announce plans to put 880 more police officers on subway duty.
   The additional transit police would patrol trains from 8 p.m. to
4 a.m., fulfilling one of Dinkins' campaign promises to put a cop
on each train at night.
   Dinkins declined to comment on the number of extra police he
wants or how he would pay for them, but agreed commuters should be
taxed. ``They're (using) city services and of course I want them to
pay for it,'' he said.
   Last week, the mayor said that other revenue options included a
raise in real estate taxes and a 25-cent surcharge on $1 state
lottery tickets sold in the city.
   It appears Dinkins wants the new payroll tax to cover half the
initial cost of the new officers. All workers would be taxed at the
same rate, no matter their income. The tax would start at one-tenth
of 1 percent next July and jump by half a year later, the sources
said.
   Brown was expected to recommend the hiring of 6,000 more
officers and another 2,700 civilians to free officers from desk
jobs.
   But the new officers won't be on the streets for months, and
possibly years. The Police Academy can handle 2,600 students at one
time by splitting classes into two shifts. It takes six months to
train an officer.

   The four victorious powers of World War II
decided Monday to suspend their rights over Berlin and Germany,
allowing the divided nation to become fully sovereign from the
moment of reunification this week.
   Foreign ministers of the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and France signed a document suspending operation of the rights
they have exercised in Germany since the war ended in 1945.
   The rights will formally terminate when all four powers have
ratified a Sept. 12 Moscow treaty that paved the way for
reunification Wednesday.
   ``Those strokes of a pen bring to an end an era of discord and
division,'' said President Bush at the opening of a two-day,
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   ``We rejoice with the German people that their nation is united
once more and we will soon welcome a united Germany into (the
conference's) community of states,'' Bush said.
   The conference is an outgrowth of the 1975 Helsinki conference
on European security that the nations intend to use as a framework
for cooperation in the post-Cold War era.
   ``We are uniting in happiness and gratitude, not in
nationalistic exhuberance,'' said West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. ``The dark chapters of our history are a
cause for reflection ... on what was done in Germany's name. That
will not be repeated.''
   Genscher reaffirmed that a reunited Germany will make no
territorial claims against its neighbors and will renounce use or
possession of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
   ``We commemorate all victims of the war and totalitarianism,''
he said, adding that Germans ``are conscious of our special
responsibility in relation to the Jewish people,'' who were
persecuted by Nazi Germany.
   The document, titled ``Declaration on the Suspension of
Operation of Four-Power Rights and Responsibilities,'' makes
Germany ``effectively sovereign from the moment of unification'' on
Wednesday, said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   The World War II victors ``declare that the effectiveness of
their rights and responsibilities with regard to Berlin and Germany
are suspended,'' the document said.
   It added that the suspension will run until the treaty itself
comes into effect.
   The Moscow treaty, which must be ratified by the U.S. Congress
and the Soviet, British and French legislative bodies, contains
results of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the three
Western allies on the future of Germany and Berlin.
   Monday's declaration was countersigned by the West and East
German governments. East Germany ceases to exist Wednesday and
becomes part of the Federal Republic of Germany, which has been the
formal name for West Germany.
   Secretary of State James Baker was host of the signing ceremony
here.
   East German Education and Science Minister Hans-Joachim Meyer
signed for East Germany, one of the last acts in his government's
existence. The other signers were Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   The signing ceremony took place without speeches before 300
journalists and diplomats. It was followed by applause and quick
champagne toasts by the six ministers befoe they departed for the
main conference.

   President Bush, who has praised the United
Nations for its support of U.S. initiatives during the Persian Gulf
crisis, promised on Monday to pay the $521.9 million in U.S.
arrears to the U.N. budget.
   ``Some money from the United States will be necessary by the end
of the year just to meet our daily operating expenses,'' U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
   U.N. officials said without the U.S. payment, they cannot meet
the payroll in December.
   Undersecretary-General Ronald Spiers, the top-ranking American
in the world body, recently warned that the United States could
have its voting rights in the General Assembly suspended in the new
year if it doesn't start to pay up.
   ``I am advised that the United States could be in that position
Jan. 1 if no new payments are forthcoming,'' Spiers said.
   A State Department official refused to discuss the possibility,
saying ``That is strictly hypothetical, and we don't comment on
hypothetical situations.''
   For years, however, the United States has come up with most of
its annual dues in a lump sum in the last months of the year.
   Bush told the General Assembly on Monday, ``My administration is
fully committed to supporting the United Nations, and to paying
what we are obligated to pay by our commitment to the Charter.''
   Congress and the Reagan administration began withholding part of
the annual U.N. dues in the 1980s to goad the world body into
trimming its budget and bureaucracy and reforming its budget
process.
   By 1988, President Reagan announced his satisfaction with the
United Nations' progress and recommended resumption of full
funding.
   However, Congress has dawdled on payments.

   Heavy fighting was reported on Monday
after a West African task force, backed by Nigerian warplanes and
heavy artillery, fired on Charles Taylor's rebel army.
   The force also began taking up positions around the Executive
Mansion, where about 1,000 soldiers from the army of slain
President Samuel Doe remain holed up.
   The firing signaled an end to a week-old truce, but that
cease-fire had proved largely ineffective. Monday's action could
force a quick conclusion to the fighting that has cut this capital
city off from the outside world for three months.
   A second rebel faction, under Prince Johnson, has threatened to
launch an all-out assault on Taylor's rebels and the remnants of
Doe's army if the task force failed to intervene.
   The force - composed of more than 5,000 soldiers from Nigeria,
Ghana, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Gambia - has come under criticism
for failing to end the 9-month-old civil and tribal war that has
killed at least 5,000 people here. Even a peace in Monrovia was not
enforced.
   A new field commander was sent in last week. Under Nigerian Gen.
Joshua Dogonyaro, tanks and armored cars from the five nations
began moving throughout the city. Roadblocks were set up.
   The force's artillery opened fire on territory on the city's
eastern edges held by Taylor. His fighters have fired on the
regional force often, killing or wounding soldiers.
   Taylor says Nigerian jets also attacked his forces.
   Johnson on Sunday called the cease-fire a failure and demanded
that the West African force act.
   He told reporters: ``If I do not see them out there, there will
be trouble. I am ready to mount my missiles and attack the mansion.
If they don't get them out, we will bomb the mansion. I am also
ready to move against Charles Taylor, since aside from Doe, Taylor
is my second target.''
   Johnson killed Doe on Sept. 10 after taking the president
prisoner in a surprise attack.
   Johnson supports the peace plan proposed by the Economic
Community of West African States. It calls for an interim
government to oversee elections restoring a civilian government.
   Taylor opposes a transitional government and has declared
himself president.
   The move east by the task force also could be an effort to take
the city's airfield, which could be used by Nigerian jets. A radio
station used by Taylor to castigate the task force also is near the
airport, and task force commanders would like to seize it.

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rangers and tourists
celebrated Yosemite's unique status as the granite gem of the
Sierra on the park's 100th birthday Monday.
   A moment of silence recalling the tranquillity before humans
came to Yosemite Valley highlighted a centennial ceremony in
sun-drenched Sentinel Meadow. The silence was broken only by a blue
jay's shrieks.
   ``Yosemite is not just for today; it is for the children and
their children tomorrow,'' said Yosemite Indian Jay Johnson,
reciting a traditional Miwok Indian blessing.
   Lee Stetson, who depicted naturalist John Muir during the
ceremony, said ``wilderness is a necessity ... as fountains of life
and fountains of people. If enough of us go among spirits of this
wilderness, ... we need not despair.''
   President Bush, restricted by the Middle East crisis, did not
attend as expected, leaving it to other federal officials to depict
the legacy of Yosemite in the majestic Sierra range.
   ``Given all the history relating to Yosemite and all of its
controversies, still it's a marvelous place for the American public
to see,'' Superintendent Michael Finley said in an interview.
   The history ranges from Muir's unswerving commitment to make
Yosemite a national park in the late 1800s to lighting-caused fires
that blackened 23,000 acres this summer, forcing an 11-day closure.
   Critics blame the National Park Service for failing to carry out
a 1980 plan to remove most public facilities from the narrow
valley, which is visited by 3.4 million people a year. Park Service
Director James Ridenour said this summer that funds will be
budgeted to relocate maintenance facilities.
   Another issue involves a concession contract with Yosemite Park
&amp; Curry Co., a subsidiary of the MCA entertainment conglomerate. An
environmental group announced plans last week to take over the
contract to run the park's hotels, restaurants and concession
stands. The contract expires in 1993.
   Despite such issues, Finley said the Park Service has been a
good steward of Yosemite and its famous features such as El
Capitan, Half Dome and Yosemite Falls.
   ``We believe we've seen 100 years of preservation, and we're
working hard to ensure that the next 100 years are even going to be
better for the visitors and the park,'' Finley said.
   ``We've undertaken major programs for restoration of the
ecology, reintroduced Bighorn sheep, recovered peregrine falcons -
up to four nesting pairs at this point,'' he said.
   ``We're restoring trampled down meadows, replanting oak trees,
have a major program to restore the Merced River and will undertake
another program on the Tuolumne River and our lakes.''
   No one would appear to know more of Yosemite's history than
87-year-old Carl Sharsmith, who has served as a naturalist in
Tuolumne Meadows almost every summer for six decades.
   ``My duties are light,'' Sharsmith said. ``I get a group and go
for a bit of a walk and chat along the way - three hours at the
most.''
   The park's centennial is attracting more attention in the area
than did the historic formation of the park by Congress on Oct. 1,
1890.
   Back then, the weekly Mariposa Gazette, the closest community
newspaper, put the story of Yosemite's beginning on page 2.

   The prosecution rested its case Monday and
jurors got their first look at the seven Robert Mapplethorpe
photographs that resulted in obscenity charges against an art
gallery and its director.
   The eight-member Hamilton County Municipal Court jury remained
expressionless as the photographs were passed around.
   The Contemporary Arts Center and Director Dennis Barrie are on
trial on misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and using
children in nudity-related material.
   If convicted of both charges, Barrie could be sentenced to one
year in jail and fined $2,000. The gallery could be fined $10,000
for conviction on both counts.
   The prosecution completed its case after questioning its third
witness and entering the photographs into evidence. All of the
witnesses were police officers.
   After prosecutors rested, Judge David Albanese rejected a
defense request to dismiss the charges, and the defense began to
present witnesses.
   The seven photographs were among 175 pictures in an exhibit
called ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.'' The seven-week
exhibit drew 80,000 people before it ended May 26.
   Five of the photographs show sexually graphic acts involving
men, and two are of children whose genitals are exposed.
   Prosecutors contend all that is necessary for a conviction under
Ohio obscenity law is to prove the photos were displayed.
   ``The bottom line is the pictures. We're not required to show
contemporary community standards because the court determines
that,'' prosecutor Frank Prouty said.
   The prosecution entered the photographs into evidence over
defense lawyers' objections. They argued that the photos were being
taken out of context and should be presented as part of the entire
exhibit, as they were displayed.
   During questioning of the first defense witness, defense lawyer
Marc Mezibov gave the photos to jurors to help them understand
remarks by the woman who assembled the exhibit.
   Janet Kardon, former director of the University of
Pennsylvania's Institute of Contemporary Art, testified that she
worked closely with Mapplethorpe in choosing photographs for the
exhibit. She said the 175 photos were culled from more than 2,000
and that each was chosen for its artistic merit.
   ``We looked for a body of work that has consistency - saying
something that is important to say,'' Ms. Kardon said.
   She said she felt an urgency to put the exhibit together between
April 1987 and December 1988 because Mapplethorpe was dying of
AIDS. He died in Boston in March 1989 at age 42.
   ``He was one of the most important photographers working in the
'80s. I felt it was my responsibility as a curator to work with him
while he was alive,'' Ms. Kardon said.
   When asked by prosecutors to describe the artistic merit of four
photos depicting sexually explicit acts, Ms. Kardon said they were
artistically lighted and framed, and showed symmetry and use of
horizontal and vertical lines.
   Jacquelynn Baas, director of the University of California's art
museum, referred to texture and effectiveness of expression in
describing the same photos.
   ``Robert Mapplethorpe was an artist who set out very consciously
and with a great deal of courage to create a wide range of art. ...
He very consciously explored what makes a work of art a very
powerful experience,'' she said.
   Barrie's lawyer, H. Louis Sirkin, told jurors that the gallery
director and its officers knew the exhibit would be controversial.
But he said they believed the educational and cultural value
outweighed other considerations and was consistent with the
gallery's mission to display contemporary art.
   ``There was controversy, but there was only one intent and
purpose ... to add to the cultural enhancement of the citizens of
this city and this area,'' Sirkin said.
   ``It was brought here not to appeal to anyone's prurient
interest,'' he said. ``It was brought here to teach and ... to show
the world this brilliant photographer and some of the inner makings
of that man and some of the torture that, perhaps, he suffered.''

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators staged a ``mutant pageant''
Monday, the eve of the 10th anniversary of the last evacuation of
Love Canal, to protest resettlement of the neighborhood near the
infamous dump.
   The demonstration attracted about two dozen environmental
activists, some in costume to suggest the result of ruinous
environmental policies. One woman dressed as a smiling face with
only one eye. A multilegged ``mutant'' dubbed ``Miss Environmental
Bonding'' was two women in one dress.
   The demonstration outside the Capitol included a blistering
attack on Gov. Mario Cuomo, who is running for a third term this
year and is considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
candidate.
   ``We are Governor Cuomo's walking, talking, living victims and
potential victims of his bad policies,'' said Lois Gibbs, a former
Love Canal resident who heads the Washington-based Citizens
Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.
   One demonstrator serving as pageant judge dressed as a
caricature of Cuomo, with fluorescent ping-pong balls coming out of
his ears and a badge proclaiming him a ``part-time
environmentalist.''
   Among other things, the activists are fighting the state's
effort to resettle part of Niagara Falls' Love Canal neighborhood,
renamed ``Black Creek Village'' in an effort to attract potential
home buyers.
   The activists also protested nuclear power and New York's effort
to find a dump site for its low-level radioactive waste.
   Love Canal became a symbol of the nation's toxic waste problem
in the late 1970s after about 2,500 people were forced to abandon
their homes. They left when 22,000 tons of dioxin, PCBs and other
hazardous chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier by the Hooker
Chemical Co. were discovered to have spread through the
neighborhood.
   The first evacuations were ordered in August 1978.
Then-President Carter ordered the last round of evacuations on Oct.
2, 1980.
   The dump has been capped, but most of the chemicals are still
buried under a fenced-off 70-acre mound. State officials insist the
area planned for resettlement is no more contaminated than
comparable neighborhoods in Niagara Falls.
   Thomas Conroy, a spokesman for Cuomo, said state Health
Department studies were the only consideration in the Love Canal
resettlement.
   ``Love Canal's resettlement was done exclusively on the
scientific evidence, period,'' Conroy said.

<TEXT>
   The government on Monday
announced the arrests of three black men in connection with a
shooting rampage on a train that left 26 blacks dead and more than
100 injured.
   The statement by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok did not
name the men or say if they were associated to a particular
political group.
   According to witnesses, men with guns and machetes randomly
attacked black commuters on an evening train Sept. 13 heading from
Johannesburg to the neighboring township of Soweto.
   The attack was one of the worst single incidents in the recent
fighting in the townships around Johannesburg. About 800 blacks
have died since early August.
   Most of the battles have been between the African National
Congress and the rival Inkatha movement. But the ANC says it
believes a ``third force,'' possibly tied to the security forces,
has been orchestrating the violence.
   Also Monday, police said 11 blacks had been arrested in the
killing of four whites in a black township.
   The four victims - three men and a woman - were stabbed and set
ablaze Saturday evening after visiting a bar in Khutloanong, 150
miles southwest of Johannesburg, police said.
   The area has had several racial confrontations in recent months,
but police have not said if Saturday's attack was racially
motivated.

   Texas and California savings and loans
dominate a list of the top 100 federal thrift investigations by the
Justice Department, a trade newspaper said Monday.
   Among the prominent S&amp;Ls on the list are Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, Irvine, Calif., whose former owner, Charles H.
Keatin  Jr. has been jailed awaiting trial on criminal charges,
National Mortgage News reported.
   Also listed are:
   -Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, Denver, where
Neil Bush, the president's son served as a director.
   -CenTrust Savings Bank, Miami, whose former chairman, David
Paul, was a prominent Democratic campaign contributor.
   -Columbia Savings and Loan Association, Beverely Hills, Calif.,
which held the industry's largest junk bond portfolio and had
extensive links with Michael Milken, once head of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s junk bond department.
   There were 36 Texas S&amp;Ls on the list and 20 from California.
Both states had liberal laws permitting S&amp;Ls a wide range of
investments not permitted most thrifts. Oklahoma and Illinois and
eight institutions listed, Florida had six; Colorado, five, and
Louisiana and New Jersey, four each.
   Nearly all of the thrifts already have been seized by the
government. There are 116 institutions listed because in some cases
several thrifts were part of one investigation.
   The weekly trade newspaper obtained a copy of the list, which
has not been publicly released. It was compiled earlier this year
by the Justice Department and the Office of Thrift Supervision as
an aid to managing S&amp;L probes.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments Begin in Shawcross Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer conceded Monday in opening
arguments that his client killed the 10 women he is accused of
murdering during the past two years.
   ``Only a fool would come up here and tell you that Mr. Shawcross
did not commit some of these murders, or all of these murders,''
Thomas Cocuzzi told the Monroe County Court jury.
   Arthur J. Shawcross, 45, was arrested in January after state
police found him near the body of one of the victims. During
questioning, he told police he had killed the women during sexual
encounters gone awry.
   ``One of the non-issues in this case is that Mr. Shawcross
committed the acts that caused the deaths of these women,'' Cocuzzi
said. ``But conduct alone does not constitute a crime. You must
consider the context of the mental state of the accused.''
   Cocuzzi said the defense will ask jurors to acquit Shawcross by
reason of insanity. At the least, he said, the jury will be asked
to reduce the charges from murder to manslaughter because he was
emotionally disturbed at the time of the killings.
   Assistant County District Attorney Charles Siragusa said in his
opening argument that Shawcross himself supplied police with their
best evidence when he confessed.
   Most of the victims were prostitutes, he said. ``All were easy
prey, easily approached, easily isolated, easily killed and easily
disposed of,'' he said.
   Siragusa also said police found fibers on many of the victims'
bodies that matched carpeting in cars used by Shawcross, as well as
other evidence linking him to the killings.
   Judge Donald Wisner granted a request to impose an order
prohibiting members of the district attorney's office and the
offices of the defense lawyers from publicly discussing the case.
The order does not extend to the defense lawyers themselves or to
Siragusa, but does include District Attorney Howard Relin.
   Defense lawyers complained that comments Relin made last week to
a newspaper about the insanity defense could affect the trial.
   When he was arrested, Shawcross was on parole after serving 15
years in prison for the 1972 strangling of an 8-year-old girl in
Watertown, his hometown. Shawcross also confessed to killing a
10-year-old boy there.
   Shawcross' lawyers said during jury selection last week that
there will be testimony that Shawcross was sexually abused as a
child and had traumatic experiences in Vietnam.
   He faces a later trial in Wayne County for a November 1989
strangling.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department said Monday an
investigation has proven that a graduate mathematics program at the
University of California at Los Angeles discriminated against Asian
Americans.
   Michael Williams, assistant secretary for civil rights, said a
30-month investigation found ``a statistical disparity in the rates
of admission to the mathematics department on the basis of race''
and ``an inconsistency in how Asian and white applicants who
received the same evaluation ratings were treated.''
   There was ``insufficient evidence to show a nondiscriminatory
basis for this pattern,'' said Williams.
   Seventy-five other departments were cleared of discrimination
allegations, while eight departments were found to have
inconclusive records, Williams said.
   The Office of Civil Rights also is investigating undergraduate
admission practices at UCLA and at Harvard.
   As a result of the findings, Williams said UCLA must offer
admission to five Asian-American students who had been
``discriminatorily denied admission.'' The university also must
establish a uniform system of admission and improve recordkeeping
``to allow us to determine whether or not it is observing the civil
rights laws.''
   UCLA Chancellor Charles Young said the university will appeal
the violation finding because te admissions processes, enrolling 15,000
students
per year. A total of 2,000 student files were examined and dozens
of interviews with students, faculty and administrators were
conducted.
   The department said UCLA must maintain certain records on their
admission decisions in eight other graduate programs, including the
school of management, computer science department, electrical
engineering department, philosophy department, biological chemistry
department, school of public health and school of architecture and
urban planning.

<HEAD>News Report: 1,000 Egyptians Died in Iraq the Past 9 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,000 Egyptian workers died in Iraq
the past nine months, and evidence from those who had autopsies
performed showed that 60 percent of the deaths were caused by
bullet wounds and skull fractures, the government said.
   Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa told the state newspaper
Al-Ahram the dead were all men aged 19 to 44. Moussa's statement is
set for publication Tuesday, but an advance copy of the report was
obtained by The Associated Press.
   Moussa made his statement after submitting a report Monday to
President Hosni Mubarak about the marked increase in the number of
Egyptians dying in Iraq following Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   More than 1 million Egyptians - most of them imported workers -
were in Iraq when it invaded Kuwait. Egypt has strongly opposed the
invasion and has contributed thousands of troops to the
multinational force sent to Saudi Arabia to defend against a
possible Iraqi attack.
   There were reports before the invasion that some Iraqi soldiers
returning home after the 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war
attacked Egyptian workers in the belief the Egytians had taken
their jobs.
   Moussa said 995 bodies of Egyptian workers arrived from Iraq the
past nine months and autopsies by Egyptian doctors indicated 60
percent of the deaths were caused by assault. It was not
immediately known how many autopsies were performed.
   He said recent Iraqi medical reports shipped with the bodies
said the deaths resulted from bullet wounds or skull fracture, but
did not indicated the circumstances that led to the violent deaths.
   Before the invasion, Moussa said, Iraqi medical reports
mentioned only natural causes for the deaths.
   He said the number of deaths since the invasion has grown
sharply, but there were no reliable detailed figures.
   He said the Egyptian foreign ministry has asked Iraq for
detailed reports on the circumstances of the deaths and added that
his ministry is questioning Egyptian workers returning from Kuwait.

   The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation said Monday
it will donate 20 percent of its yearly gross revenues for the next
three years to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
   The foundation said the pledge could amount to $3 million and is
the largest amount ever pledged by a single donor.
   ``Robert Mapplethorpe lives though his art and now also through
his legacy to those who will put an end to the scourge of AIDS,''
said director Mathilde Krim.
   Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March 1989. He was 42.
   The Mapplethorpe Foundation said the money would come primarily
from the sale of Mapplethorpe's photography.
   Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis
Barrie, are on trial on charges of pandering obscenity and using a
child in nudity-related material because of seven photographs in
the exhibit ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''

   A highly publicized strike called by
the leftist Sandinista labor unions fizzled on Monday. Most people
went to work and only minor incidents were reported.
   Tires burned at a few intersections, but drivers skirted them as
traffic proceeded as usual for a Monday morning.
   A protest march called by the unions drew at most 500 people.
Expecting a bigger turnout, the government had assigned about 2,500
police to the route.
   The only violence was the burning of the transmission tower of a
pro-Sandinista radio station Sunday night.
   The strike was called to protest an austere economic recovery
program by President Violeta Chamorro's government. It includes
privatizing the broad state sector, trimming the public payroll and
doing away with state subsidies to diminish the financial deficit.
   Those programs plus weekly devaluations of the Nicaraguan
currency, the cordoba, have boosted inflation to about 80 percent a
month.
   The government granted broad concessions Friday, hoping to head
off strikes similar to those that crippled the nation in May and
July. Labor leaders said the strike would take place anyway,
although the government announced a suspension of layoffs, a food
distribution program for peasants, a commission to supervise land
distribution and a job bank.
   Pro-Sandinista newspapers ran exaggerated front-page headlines
Monday promoting the strike call.
   ``The People To Defend Themselves'' trumpeted Barricada,
official newspaper of the Sandinista Front.
   ``Neighborhoods On Fire!'' a headline read in El Nuevo Diario,
with a second line below, ``Civic Protest Takes Off in Managua.''
   However, ENABUS, the government bus depot, was the only site in
Managua where Sandinista supporters were visible. Even there only a
dozen militants showed up, all helping keep the fires going.
   ``Bums! Why don't you go to work!'' shouted a taxi driver at the
supporters as they piled fresh tires on the pyres.
   ``I don't agree with this,'' carpenter Mario Mora, 61, said of
the announced strike on his way to work at the state construction
company Sovipe.
   ``Even an illiterate can understand that we can't behave like
macho cats all the time.
   ``It's like Dona Violeta says. If we don't work, this country is
going to go down the drain.''

<HEAD>Report: Mauritania Waging `Undeclared War' Against Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mauritania's Arab-led security forces have stepped
up a campaign of murder and torture against blacks in the northwest
African nation, Amnesty International said in a report released
Tuesday.
   Some of the victims were decapitated or their heads were crushed
by stones, according to the London-based human rights organization.
   ``A year ago, we said the persecution of Mauritania's black
community had reached a peak,'' the organization said. ``That
appalling situation has now gone from bad to worse.''
   The conflict began with a 1989 border dispute between
predominately Arab Mauritania and Senegal, a mostly black nation to
the south. The two former French colonies are separted by the
Senegal River.
   Amnesty said Mauritanian troops have abducted and killed
hundreds of Mauritanian blacks and paraded through rural villages
with the decapitated bodies of victims.   About 19 percent of Mauritania's
1.9 million people are black.
   ``What is taking place in southern Mauritania is, in effect, an
undeclared war in which one community is using the resources and
power of the state against another,'' Amnesty said.
   In April 1989, two Sengalese goat herders who crossed the border
were shot. Hundreds of Mauritanians and Senegalese were killed in
the ensuing clashes and tensions escalated between Mauritania's
black and Arab-Berber communities. Tens of thousands of blacks were
expelled from Mauritania.
   The report said the government troops were backed by Haratine
militia, composed of descendants of freed black slaves who share
Arab-Berber culture.
   ``People are `disappearing' or being killed by government
soldiers in the south every day,'' the report said.
   ``People taken by troops have had their heads crushed with heavy
stones or cut off and paraded around village centers to intimidate
others. Other have been shot dead simply for fishing while a curfew
was in force,'' the report added.
   Amnesty said security forces have picked up hundreds of black
villagers the past year and detained many without trial.
Authorities have imposed curfews that vary in different areas.
   ``The security forces seem to have a free hand in abusing
innocent villagers,'' the report said.

   Protesters at the University of the District
of Columbia said they were successful in persuading most students
to stay away from classes Monday, the sixth day of a demonstration
called to oust the school's board of directors.
   Administrators opened the university for the first day since
Wednesday, when several hundred students barricaded themselves
inside a campus building and refused to leave until the 11 mayoral
appointees to the 15-member board resigned.
   All buildings except the one occupied by the students were
reopened. But instructors were seen conducting classes with fewer
than 10 students each.
   Some students who arrived on campus Monday said they showed up
even though they were not sure whether classes would be held.
   ``As far as we are concerned, school is still closed,'' student
Mark Thompson, a leader of the protest, told about 500 students who
were on campus Monday morning.
   Trustees and students have reached agreement on nearly all of
about 40 demands submitted by students. Talks have stalemated on
the issue of the resignations, with most board members refusing to
quit.
   ``It would not appear to be in the best interests of the
university for them to quit,'' UDC spokesman John Britton said.
   ``We want to reiterate that the resignations are still on the
table and it is ludicrous for them not to do what we've asked them
to,'' Thompson said.
   Two trustees have agreed to resign, but for personal reasons,
not because of the protest, Britton said.
   Trustee Lourdes Miranda submitted her resignation three weeks
ago, and Trustee Arthur Reynolds has verbally agreed to resign, he
said.
   Thompson said Trustee Herbert O. Reid has agreed to quit because
of illness, but Britton said the school had not received a letter
of resignation from him.
   Trustee Nira Long has agreed to step down as board chairwoman,
but has refused to resign.

<HEAD>Man Who Sold 2 Live Crew Record Goes to Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An all-white jury on Monday began
hearing the trial of a record store owner who is charged with
selling a 2 Live Crew album to an undercover officer after a judge
had ruled it obscene.
   The trial is the first time the black rap group's album ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be'' has faced scrutiny in criminal court.
   Charles Freeman was arrested in his E-C Records store by six
undercover Broward Sheriff's deputies on June 8. The arrest came
two days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez said the
Miami-based group's album was obscene.
   The lyrics include sexually explicit language and have been
criticized as promoting violence against women.
   Using Gonzalez' ruling, prosecutors say they have a strong case
before Broward County Judge Paul Backman.
   ``When you have listened to (the album), you will know that it
is openly offensive to an average person,'' Leslie Robson, Broward
assistant state attorney, told the jury in her opening statement.
   If convicted of selling obscene material, 31-year-old Freeman
faces up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Freeman, who is black, said before the panel was chosen that he
would be comfortable if other blacks were selected.
   But he declined to comment about the jury's racial makeup after
its selection. His attorney, Bruce Rogow, who also represents 2
Live Crew, said the defense was surprised that of a pool of about
35 potential jurors, only one was black.
   Rogow said he was confident that if the defense's arguments are
clearly presented, ``whatever kind of jury we have will come back
with the right answer.''
   The defense, which will present its case after the state rests
Tuesday, will argue the album does not appeal to anyone's prurient
interests and that it has literary and artistic value, Rogow said.
   ``They may be strong words, words that are not used in everyday
conversation but they are spliced together into ways that are
imaginative and creative,'' said Rogow. ``The mistake here is to
only hear the nasty words. You have to listen to the whole
record.''
   Although Backman refused to allow a transcript of the ``As Nasty
As They Wanna Be'' lyrics presented in court, he did allow the
album to be played Monday.
   The judge also has forbidden prosecutors from referring to
Gonzalez' ruling. The federal judge ruled that the album violated
community obscenity standards in three south Florida counties.
Backman said that since Freeman was arrested for selling the record
to an adult, prosecutors will not be allowed to discuss any
possible impact on juveniles.
   First Amendment experts are monitoring the case, and that of the
2 Live Crew members who were arrested after performing live
versions of the banned lyrics at a nightspot in nearby Hollywood.
   Their trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 9.

according to the Tsunami Warning Center here.
   The quake was centered 30 miles north of Homer, about 90 miles
southwest of Anchorage, and struck at 2:23 p.m.
   It registered magnitude 3.8 on the Richter scale. A quake of
magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a
quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage.
   ``It was felt sharply in Homer for a few seconds,'' said

   A man who bombed a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration office was sentenced Monday to life imprisonment
without possibility of parole.
   Jeffrey Matthews, also known as Jeffrey Ciganek, had entered a
guilty plea July 31 to federal charges including the March 17
bombing that leveled the DEA office in Fort Myers and homicide in
furtherance of a criminal enterprise.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich also sentenced
Matthews, 23, for running a criminal enterprise and possession with
intent to distribute more than 11 pounds of cocaine.
   The judge also sentenced Matthew's uncle, Kenneth Bird Sr., to
70 months in prison for possession with intent to distribute more
than 11 pounds of cocaine. Bird also had pleaded guilty.
   The case stemmed from an investigation of the drug-related
slaying of a federal witness and the activities of Matthews' drug
trafficking organization in Fort Myers Beach, according to the U.S.
Attorney's Office.
   In his plea, Matthews admitted to killing witness Steven Franken
in January to further his cocaine-trafficking.
   Matthews' brother, John Ciganek, along with Kelly Susskind are
scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 17 for conspiracy to possess and
distribute cocaine. Agents say John Ciganek and Susskind, who
pleaded guilty last month to the charges, conspired with Matthews
and Bird.
   The bombing of the DEA office came two days after federal drug
indictments were issued against the four.
   Matthews was the only person charged in the bombing, which
caused damages estimated at $4 million. No one was injured.

<TEXT>
   A clash in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga River
Valley has left 15 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and two soldiers
dead, the army said Monday.
   The battle Friday was the latest in fighting that has left at
least 70 dead on both sides in the region the past week.
   In the central Andes, Shining Path rebels killed six members of
a local peasant defense unit 155 miles northeast of Huancayo,
police said Monday. Huancayo is a major central Andean city 120
miles east of Lima.
   In Lima, meanwhile, the newspaper Expreso reported Monday that
the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement had offered to lay
down its arms.
   The jungle ambush came two days after President Alberto Fujimori
rejected $36 million in U.S. military aid for Peru's armed forces
to fight drug trafficking.
   Fujimori had criticized the proposed military aid package,
saying military repression alone will not put an end to the coca
trade in the Upper Huallaga region.
   Hundreds of thousands of peasants grow coca in the valley.
Fujimori says economic aid is needed to develop the area and wean
farmers from coca.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an
airbase jointly with Peruvian police in the Huallaga Valley.
   In Lima, Tupac Amaru leader Victor Polay, who escaped from
prison in July, offered to halt attacks if the government accepted
certain conditions, the newspaper Expreso reported.
   A man identifying himself as Polay called the newspaper and said
he he had made the offer in an interview with Interior Minister
Gen. Adolfo Alvarado.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman had no comment on the news
report.
   The Tupac Amaru group, which began operations in 1984, is a
smaller and less dangerous band than the Shining Path.
   Nearly 20,000 people have died in the 10 years since the Shining
Path took up arms. The majority of the victims have been civilians
caught in the crossfire between the rebels and the armed forces.

<HEAD>10 People Reported Wounded in Lebanese Clash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese radio report said at least 10
people were wounded Monday night by gunfire from troops loyal to
rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun at a checkpoint at the Death River
in east Beirut.
   The broadcast by Voice of Free Lebanon, outlet for the rival
Lebanese Forces militia, was monitored in Nicosia.
   It said some victims were taken to two hospitals after gunfire
erupted in the Christian enclave north of Beirut, but others lay
where they fell. The radio quoted the Lebanese Red Cross as saying
the area was full of land mines and too dangerous for ambulances at
night.
   Neither Aoun's forces nor authorities in Beirut could be
contacted immediately for comment on the report.
   The checkpoint area is less than 1 mile from the northern edge
of Christian east Beirut.
   The radio claimed that pro-Aoun troops, manning a roadblock on
the crossing, let almost 150 people cross, then opened fire from
behind to make it appear the shooting came from a rival checkpoint
manned by the Lebanese Forces.
   Aoun refuses to recognize the government of President Elias
Hrawi. He has been increasingly pressured by an economic blockade
imposed by Hrawi's army.
   The maverick general has accused Hrawi's government of seeking
Syrian army support to attack the enclave held by Aoun's 15,000
troops in parts of east Beirut and the adjoining mountains in the
Christian heartland.
   Newspaper reports said Hrawi would order a military thrust to
evict Aoun from the Presidential Palace if the blockade against his
60-square-mile enclave fails.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, acknowledged
Monday that the home heating oil tax of 2 cents per gallon in the
budget deal between the White House and Congress was included at
his urging to spread the pain of tax increases to the Northeast.
   Bentsen, who chairs the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee,
said he objected to home heating oil being left out of the
agreement just before it was struck Sunday.
   ``It's a question of equity, of ensuring that all regions of
this country bear a fair share of the burden of reducing the
federal deficit,'' Bentsen said.
   Residents of the South and West will have to shoulder a greater
burden through the increase in taxes on gasoline amounting to 12
cents per gallon eventually, 2 cents from a general fuels tax and
10 cents specifically levied on gasoline.
   ``Symbolically it is important to send a signal that the
different regions of the United States will all carry a fair share
of this burden,'' Bentsen said.
   The inclusion of the tax was done so close to the announcement
of the agreement by President Bush on Sunday that it stunned Rep.
Silvio Conte, a Massachusetts Republican who opposed it in the
budget talks.
   It caught Senate Finance Committee staffers by surprise. They
told told reporters heating oil had been exempted from the fuel
tax.
   ``When I went into the White House, it was not taxed,'' Conte
said on Sunday. ``When I left, it was taxed.''
   The Northeast is not the only cold region of the country in
winter by any means, but it is the one where oil dominates the home
heating market.
   Conte said Monday he was furious at the last-minute change and
was trying to get Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who
selected Bentsen as his vice presidential running mate in 1988, to
lobby the Texas senator. He used unusually harsh language in
criticizing Bentsen.
   ``It was real affront to his running mate Mr. Dukakis,'' Conte
said of Bentsen's move. ``He spat at him. He spat at (New York Gov.
Mario) Cuomo. He just better not come up to the Northeast; there's
a bounty on that guy.''
   Both Conte and Bentsen were participants in the budget summit.
   Bentsen said home heating oil was in the tax provisions Saturday
but on Sunday it was gone.
   ``When I learned Sunday morning that, in a midnight deal, home
heating oil had been totally exempted from any tax at all, I
protested in the strongest possible terms,'' Bentsen said.
   A typical New England household used 736 gallons of home heating
oil in the winter of 1987, the latest for which figures are
available, said Tom Welch of the Energy Information Administration.
The increased tax would add $14.72 to the cost of that much fuel
oil.
   In 1988, average gasoline consumption per household was 917
gallons in the Northeast, 1,016 gallons in the Midwest, and 1,046
gallons in the South and West, Welch said.
   Based on those figures, the average driver in the Northeast
would pay $110.04 more each year with the gasoline tax increase. A
Midwest driver would pay $121.92 more while one in the West or
South would pay $125.52 more.
   The tax on home heating oil is expected to yield the government
$200 million over five years. The gasoline tax is expected to bring
in $45 billion in that period.
   Both fuels have seen sharp price run-ups since the Aug. 2
takeover of Kuwait by Iraq.

   Iraq unexpectedly postponed its speech to
the General Assembly on Monday, just hours after President Bush
hinted an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could help resolve
Arab-Israeli tensions.
   Iraq's U.N. Mission gave no explanation for rescheduling the
address to Wednesday, but diplomats speculated Baghdad wanted time
to evaluate Bush's message.
   Earlier Monday, Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari praised
Bush for saying he preferred ``a diplomatic outcome.''
   In his speech, Bush said Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from
Kuwait could create ``opportunities for Iraq and Kuwait to settle
their differences permanently; for the states of the gulf
themselves to build new arrangements for stability; and for all the
states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that
divides the Arabs from Israel.''
   Bush, in the speech and in a later news conference, did not
elaborate on what settlements could be possible. The United States
has long been committed to a Mideast settlement in which Israel
would exchange territory for Arab recognition of its right to
exist.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has suggested he would pull his
troops out if the Arab dispute with Israel is handled
simultaneously. On Sunday, Saddam announced he wanted to pursue
dialogue toward a ``reasonable solution, and that this solution
should be comprehensive so that we could enjoy peace.''
   Saddam also said Palestinians should be given a homeland that
``occupation armies'' must leave the region.
   ``We do support any peaceful settlement of the situation, or of
the crisis,'' said al-Anbari, who is scheduled to give Iraq's U.N.
speech. ``Fortunately, he did mention he would prefer to have a
peaceful diplomatic solution.''
   The tone of Bush's remarks echoed French President Francois
Mitterrand's speech to open the 45th General Assembly on Sept. 24.
   ``If Iraq were to withdraw its troops and free hostages,
everything may be possible,'' said Mitterrand.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   More than 70 world leaders prepared to leave the
city Monday after the historic Childrens Summit, not soon enough
for New Yorkers who leaned on car horns because of chaotic traffic
conditions all around the town.
   Streets around the United Nations and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
where the President and Barbara Bush were staying, were blocked off
at various times during the day, leading to near-gridlock in many
areas and frustrated drivers.
   ``Traffic is a nightmare,'' said Martin Furillo, 26, who said he
jumped out of a friend's car coming out of the Holland Tunnel
because the traffic was at a standstill. ``It was backed up
forever.''
   Miles uptown, several blocks around the Waldorf were blocked off
by police when Bush left for the Jacob Javits Convention Center to
address the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on
Monday afternoon.
   ``Traffic is basically gridlock all over,'' said Tom Lodato, an
inspector with the Department of Transportation's Traffic Major
Incident Response Team.
   Crowds of irritated pedestrians were forced to congregate for
more than five minutes at the intersections of Park Avenue and East
50th Street near the Waldorf as hundreds of police officers and
Secret Service agents guarded the t.
   Transportation officials were relieved Sunday when the predicted
traffic nightmare never materialized.

   New York City's 85,000-member teachers' union reached a
tentative agreement Monday hours after its contract ended, and
negotiators in Washington state agreed to settle the nation's
longest strike of the school year.
   A strike by public school teachers in New Orleans entered its
third week after union negotiators rejected what Orleans Parish
School Board officials said was a $13 million contract.
   In New York, the city and its teachers' union reached a
tentative agreement on a $236 million contract that would raise
salaries 5.5 percent, both sides said. The pact was limited to one
year because of the rocky economy.
   ``To enter into a multi-year contract without some concept of
your ability to fund it doesn't seem to be wise,'' Mayor David
Dinkins said. ``We're fortunate everybody sort of understood
that.''
   The raise would bring starting salaries to $26,375 and senior
salaries to $52,750. The old contract, covering 65,000 public
school teachers and 20,000 other school employees, expired at
midnight. School was in session Monday.
   The pact went to the United Federation of Teachers' 3,000-member
delegate assembly, which voted overwhelmingly Monday to recommend
it to the full membership. Voting by the membership could three
weeks.
   About 80 percent of the delegates backed the new contract in a
voice vote, said union spokeswoman Susan Amlung.
   ``It was a very strong vote, but I don't think anyone is really
content,'' said Amlung. ``The feeling is that the city went as far
as it was reasonably expected to go, given the financial situation.
It was clearly a compromise.''
   She said the teachers had been seeking a raise of at least 8
percent.
   The new contract will cover employees of about 1,000 elementary,
junior high and high schools that serve about 946,000 students. The
20,000 employees who are not teachers include counselors, social
workers and secretaries.
   In Everett, Wash., where 460 teachers have been on strike since
Aug. 30, negotiators assisted by three state mediators reached a
tentative agreement after talking through the night, said
Washington Education Association spokesman John Cahill.
   The proposal was ratified on a voice vote Monday evening by
teachers in the Mukilteo School District, but contract details were
not immediately disclosed. Classes were set to start Wednesday for
the 9,100 students.
   ``We are especially pleased for the children. It's been a long
month out of school,'' said Schools Superintendent James Shoemake.
   Classes were to have started Sept. 5. Key issues included class
size, teacher assignment and transfer policies, school
decision-making panels and pay for extra time, responsibility and
incentives.
   In New Orleans, about 3,000 of the city's 4,500 teachers are on
strike, which disrupted classes for 84,000 students.
   Board president Dr. Carl Robinson said there was little else the
financially strapped school system could do to meet the demands of
the United Teachers of New Orleans and its president, Nat La Cour.
   ``We stepped over backwards to do what we've done, and his
response was to ask for more money,'' Robinson said.
   LaCour said the offer was unacceptable because it did nothing to
raise teacher salaries this year.

<TEXT>
   The owner of the home where four members of
the Herb Clutter family were slain in a celebrated 1959 murder case
has changed his mind about offering tours.
   For years the house near this southwestern Kansas community has
attracted gawkers who ignored the ``no trespassing'' signs posted
by owner Leonard Mader, who lives in the house.
   Finally, Mader decided to capitalize on interest in the death
house and began offering tours on weekends, at $5 per person.
   But after about a month, Mader has concluded it was a bad idea.
   ``We just got too many phone calls, too many complaints,'' he
said.
   The house was the scene of the murders of Clutter, his wife,
Bonnie, and their children, Nancy, 16, and Kenyon, 15. They were
slain by Richard Smith and Perry Hickock, who were convicted of
murder and hanged in 1965.
   That year author Truman Capote published his book about the
case, ``In Cold Blood,'' which was later made into a movie.

<TEXT>
   New television sets with 13-inch screens or
larger would have to include built-in decoders for displaying
closed captions for the deaf under a bill approved Monday by the
House and sent to President Bush.
   On a voice vote the House approved a measure passed by the
Senate in July requiring TV sets sold after July 1993 to be
equipped with circuitry for converting audio portions of a TV
program into subtitles on the screen.
   Decoders are available now but they sell for $160 to $200
separately.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee estimated that decoder
chips could be included in sets when manufactured without adding
more than $15 to the retail price.
   ``For a small cost ... we can ensure that the promise of the
Information Age is accessible to all Americans,'' said Rep. Edward
J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the committee's telecommunications
and finance subcommittee.
   In addition to the estimated 20 million to 24 million Americans
who are deaf or hearing impaired, Markey said the decoders also
would benefit millions of children and functionally illiterate
adults in learning to read as wells as immigrants trying to learn
English.
   All prime-time television shows broadcast by the three major
networks now carry closed captions, as do most national news shows
and sports events.

   A explosion believed caused by a gas leak
leveled a townhouse Monday, killing an elderly woman, injuring two
people in nearby houses and scattering debris over a wide area,
authorities said.
   Firefighters found the body of Marian Wilderson under a stove in
her kitchen, said Fire Capt. Pat Flynn. Wilderson was in her 70s,
he said.
   The blast flattened her house, tore away large chunks of another
house and blew a hole in the wall of third house. The explosion
rattled windows blocks away.
   Samuel Bianco, 74, and Kathleen Billnyre, 70, were treated in
hospital for cuts, officials said.
   Beams, roofing slate and glass from Wilderson's brick house, as
well as pieces of furniture and clothing, were strewn around the
neighborhood.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but a gas
leak was suspected, said Peggy Mulloy, spokeswoman for Baltimore
Gas and Electric Co. More than 50 homes were evacuated while
utility crews tried to shut off the gas.
   The utility said it received a call about a strong odor in the
neighborhood at 9:51 a.m. The explosion occurred about 10 minutes
later while a crew was on its way to investigate, said spokesman
Art Slusark.
   ``It just sounded like a great big boom,'' said Ernest Ennels,
who lives five blocks away. ``I thought it was right next door.''

   A retired Philippine Supreme Court Justice
and his son were sentenced Monday to a year in prison for trying to
smuggle hundreds of guns into their homeland.
   Antonio Paredes, 65, of Long Beach, and Quintin Paredes III, 42,
of the Philippines, also were fined $6,000 each by U.S. District
Judge A. Wallace Tashima.
   Antonio Paredes is the former vice governor of Abra province.
His son was a lawyer in Manila.
   The men pleaded guilty in August to exporting guns without
permits.
   They were charged in an attempt to smuggle 371 pistols and
500,000 rounds of ammunition into the Philippines. The shipment
included 299 low-quality Targa brand handguns and 72 higher quality
Colt .45-caliber semiautomatic pistols.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carol Gillam said authorities were
investigating allegations the guns were intended for opponents of
Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   Defense attorney Ronald Litt dimissed the allegations. He said
the motive was profit, arguing that a weapon that might sell for as
little as $30 in the United States could bring $800 in the
Philippines. He said the guns had little military value.
   Kerwin Hang, 42, and his wife, Maria Louisa Tan Hang, 34, both
of the Philippines, also have pleaded guilty in the case. Maria
Hang was sentenced last month to nine months in prison. Her husband
received six months.

<TEXT>
   The president of El Salvador assured President
Bush on Monday that he will pursue the murder investigation of six
Jesuit priests and two others ``to the end,'' a U.S. official said.
   Bush met with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani during his
string of one-on-one meetings with world leaders attending a United
Nations session.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for Latin American
affairs, told reporters Bush noted the importance of the case for
U.S.-Salvadoran relations and said he supported Cristiani's
efforts.
   The priests, their housekeeper and her daughter were shot to
death last November. Eight military officers have been charged with
the crime, but none has been brought to trial.
   Aronson quoted Cristiani as saying he would ``push the murder
investigation ... until the end.''
   This is the same message that Cristiani has been giving members
of Congress in a lobbying effort aimed at heading off deep cuts in
U.S. aid
   The judge in the case, according to Aronson's account of
Cristiani's conversation with Bush, is more optimistic about a
resolution of the case since members of the military high command
visited him to promise cooperation in the investigation.
   He quoted the Salvadoran leader as saying he was concerned that
the rebels in his country were waiting to see what Congress did
about aid before agreeing to a cease-fire.
   The House already has voted a 50 percent reduction in the $85
million in annual military aid. The Bush administration is trying
to keep the Senate from going along.
   Cristiani has he would accept the cut if Congress made it
contingent on the rebels signing a cease-fire.

   Divers recovered the remains of a

the crash of a World War II plane that intruded on an air show and
performed stunts before plunging into a lake.
   No one survived the crash of the Lockheed P2V Harpoon, which
went down nose-first in six feet of water Saturday.
   Divers pulling pieces of the Navy patrol plane out of the murky
water found the remains of a seventh victim and were looking for
another body Monday because the aircraft could seat eight, the
Sheriff's Department said.
   The plane had intruded on a seaplane air show, staging an
aerobatics display before crashing into Clear Lake, 100 miles north
of San Francisco.
   Pilots and spectators said the plane made four low passes over
the crowd and floating seaplanes, then stalled and plunged into the
lake, sending up a plume of water 60 to 70 feet high.
   Aviation officials said a heavy load of fuel and passengers
combined with high temperatures may have caused the stall.
   The identities of those aboard were not immediately released,
although officials said Doug Lacey, 40, of San Rafael, the plane's
owner, was at the controls when the aircraft stopped to refuel
Saturday morning in Santa Rosa.

   Chinese attended sports events and viewed floral
displays on the site of last year's savage crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators as part of National Day celebrations
Monday.
   The holiday, marking the 1949 birth of the People's Republic of
China, was extended this year because it fell just two days before
the traditional autumn moon festival, a time for family reunions.
   Tens of thousands took advantage of the day off from work to
visit the 11th annual Asian Games under way in Beijing. The
Olympic-style event features athletes from 36 nations this year.
   In Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of pro-democracy activists
died when stormed by troops in June 1989, more than 100,000 potted
plants were arranged in a dozen floral arrangements - including one
depicted Pan-Pan, the panda mascot for the Asian Games.
   ``I've lived in Beijing for 36 years now, (and) come to see the
flowers every year. They get prettier every year,'' official
reports quoted Zhang Shuyu, an old woman from the captial's Qianmen
district.
   Last year, the government held an elaborate evening ceremony in
the square with fireworks, a 28-gun salute and performances by
thousands of dancers. Such events are held only once every five
years.
   But in Hong Kong on Monday, vandals doused two stone lions
outside a Bank of China building with black paint in an apparent
protest of the 41st National Day, celebrating the defeat of the
Nationalist government. Last year, vandals splashed red paint on
the lions.
   The acts were widely regarded as a protest over the Tiananmen
Square crackdown. Hong Kong, under British administration, is
scheduled to return to China in 1997.
   Stores and shops will be closed in China until Wednesday.
   On Sunday night, Premier Li Peng toasted the party's 41-year
rule at an annual reception for foreign diplomats.
   The Communist Party turned ``an impoverished, backward old Chian
which was subjected to the bullying and enslavement by colonialism
and imperialism, into a socialist new China with initial
prosperity,'' Li said.
   The premier's National Day toast serves as an abridged
state-of-the-nation address, summarizing China's political and
economic situation and the basic domestic and foreign policies.
   This year's toast contained no surprises, reaffirming the
government's determination to maintain a planned economy.

   President Bush assailed Iraq on Monday for invading Kuwait, but
hinted an Iraqi withdrawal could lead to settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict. Israel warned its response to an Iraqi
attack would be ``harsh and painful,'' and said it was giving out
gas masks to all citizens.
   America announced it was sending two batteries of Patriot
air-defense missiles to Israel to help defend against an increased
threat from ballistic missiles in Iraq.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered the release
of nine French nationals believed to have been held at Iraqi
targets as shields against attack - his second conciliatory gesture
in two days.
   On Sunday, he urged a peaceful international dialogue, and
mentioned France as a possible negotiating partner.
   U.S., French and British officials said Monday they wouldn't
talk until Iraq withdrew from Kuwait.
   Also Monday, Iran's official news agency said the foreign
ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia met Sunday in New York for the
first such high-level talks since the nations broke diplomatic ties
2{ years ago.
   No progress was reported, but the meeting was the most positive
sign yet the two countries may be moving toward a rapprochement. A
reconciliation would help draw Iran into the anti-Iraq camp and
intensify Saddam's isolation.
   Saddam has been courting Iran, its war enemy from 1980-88, for
help in puncturing the U.N. economic embargo imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   In other developments:
   -Oil prices tumbled $3 per barrel to $36.10 following Bush's
speech at the United Nations, which was seen as raising hopes of a
diplomatic solution to the 2-month-old crisis. As oil fell, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 63 points to 2,515.84. Gold
prices fell $15.90 an ounce, to $386.60, on the New York Commodity
Exchange.
   -Saddam addressed a message to participants in a U.N. summit on
children, telling them U.N. sanctions are depriving Iraqi children
of milk and food - ``a matter of deep concern and regret.''
   -Iraq denied responsiblity for a grenade attack Thursday on a
Djibouti cafe in which a French child was killed. French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas said France would retaliate if Iraq was found
responsible.
   -Britain announced it is sending a 3,500-strong support force,
including a 400-bed field hospital, to the gulf to back up an
armored brigade, the Desert Rats.
   In his address to the General Assembly, Bush echoed his previous
harsh line against Iraq but tempered it with talk of a diplomatic
solution.
   Iraq ``has plundered Kuwait, terrorized innocent civilians and
held even diplomats hostage,'' Bush said.
   Aligning himself with remarks last week by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Bush said Iraq and its leaders ``must
be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction.''
   A British U.N. briefing quoted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
as saying on a talk show Monday, ``You can't go in and cause all
that damage and desolation and damage to life . . . without
expecting to have to pay some compensation. . . . Nor can you go
and have your soldiers do some of the things that have been done
without expecting them to be brought before the court and be
answerable for their terrible deeds.''
   In Bush's demand for unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait,
he suggested this could lead to a resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   ``In the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from
Kuwait, I truly believe that there may be opportunities,'' he said.
   ``For Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently;
for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for
stability; and for all the states and peoples of the region to
settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.''
   The Bush administration has rejected Saddam's attempts to link
his pullout from Kuwait with a simultaneous Israeli pullout from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Bush, who has praised the United Nations for its handling of the
crisis, also promised to pay the $521.9 million in U.S. arrears to
the U.N. budget.
   Shevardnadze called Bush's speech ``brilliant.'' Iraq's
ambassador said his government ``disagreed with everything,'' but
took positive note of Bush's mentioning a desire for a peaceful
solution.
   A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he
did not see Bush's speech as linking the gulf crisis to Israel's
conflict with the Arabs.
   ``I don't think that is a linkage,'' Avi Pazner said. ``He said
similar things before.''
   The Israeli army announced it will begin distributing gas masks
next week to all its 4.7 million citizens, including Jews and
Israeli Arabs.
   Saddam has repeatedly threatened to attack Israel, at one time
threatening to burn half the Jewish state with chemical weapons.
   Officials said the distribution plan was developed long before
the gulf crisis.
   The 140,000 Arabs living in annexed east Jerusalem will be
issued gas masks. The government said the 1.7 million Palestinians
of the West Bank and Gaza will have to pay the purchase price of
$100-plus per kit because they are not covered by Israeli national
insurance.
   Each kit contains a gas mask, a syringe with a nerve gas
antidote and purifying powder. Instructions will be in Hebrew,
Arabic, English and Russian.
   Gas masks will be available for tourists at hotels, officials
said.
   At the United Nations, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said
Israel ``will know how to defend itself if attacked and its
response will be harsh and painful.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted as saying on the
French La Cinq television network on Monday that Saddam has had
secret contacts with Israel during the gulf crisis. Israel denied
it.

   Disabled activists barricaded themselves in the
president's office at Morehouse College on Monday to try to force a
meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, a
former dean at the college.
   More than a dozen demonstrators in wheelchairs rolled into
Morehouse President Leroy Keith's office before noon Monday.
   Scores of additional protesters followed, blocking the front
door and hallways and chanting, ``We want Sullivan!'' and ``We
shall overcome!''
   Keith left by a rear door.
   The protesters belonged to Americans Disabled for Attendant
Programs Today, or ADAPT, a national advocacy group for the
disabled.
   The group's members were angered that Sullivan, a former dean of
the Morehouse School of Medicine, did not respond to an invitation
to meet with them but agreed to speak at a recent AIDS symposium in
San Francisco.
   ``This group invited him to speak on an issue as serious as
AIDS. He chose to ignore the issue,'' said Michael Auberger,
co-founder of ADAPT.
   At least 50 demonstrators said they planned to remain in the
president's office overnight.
   Morehouse officials told the protesters that Sullivan had
refused to meet them.
   ``He will not meet with you under these circumstances - by
holding an institution hostage,'' said Richard Ammons, vice
president of development.
   The protesters said they came to Georgia because the state is
one of the worst at caring for its disabled citizens.
   Georgia and 12 other states do not provide state-funded care for
disabled people outside of nursing homes, said Mark Johnson,
spokesman for the Georgia branch of ADAPT.
   Protesters also complained that many operators of nursing homes
for the disabled have nothing more than a business license.
   ``The nursing home lobby is real strong in Georgia, and that is
who the decision makers are listening to right now,'' Johnson said.
``Institutions are being rewarded for bad work and the people who
need help are not getting it.''

   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou was
hospitalized early Tuesday after complaining of heart and breathing
problems.
   A medical bulletin at the cardiac unit of the General State
Hospital described the 71-year-old Papandreou's condition as
satisfactory.
   It said he was being treated for a possible irregular heartbeat,
slight breathing difficulties and bronchial spasms.
   Papandreou, socialist prime minister from 1981 to 1989, was
treated for kidney problems last June and underwent triple-bypass
heart surgery in August 1988.
   Since then, he has led a campaign against the governing
conservatives, despite being indicted on corruption charges in
connection with a bank scandal. No trial date has been set.
   Papandreou complained shortly after a parliamentary debate late
Monday that he was having trouble breathing, and his doctor decided
he should be hospitalized immediately, radio stations reported.
   Another former official charged in the Bank of Crete scandal,
Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, was jailed Monday pending trial.
   Koutsogiorgas, a deputy premier and justice minister under
Papandreou, is accused of accepting a $2 million bribe for helping
block an audit at the bank, and two other charges.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said
Monday that his country intends to commit non-military personnel
and material to other nations to bring peace to the Middle East and
Cambodia.
   Kaifu said the Persian Gulf crisis provides an opportunity for
Japan to consider ``what it can do to cooperate fully with the U.N.
and other countries,'' although its constitution restricts such
action.
   ``We have heard that when we cooperate with the United Nations,
we should not limit ourselves to simply putting up money but should
should toil together with others. That is my feeling as well,.''
Kaifu said.
   He spoke hours before his departure for a seven-day trip to
Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman - the first visit to
the Middle East by a Japanese prime minister since Takeo Fukuda
visited Saudi Arabia 12 years ago.
   Kaifu told a news conference Japan is not only commiting $4
billion in the crisis, but, ``It is also Japan's policy to commit
personnel, material and wisdom and toil together with all the other
countries.''
   Japan has committed $2 billion to support the multilateral
military operation in the gulf and another $2 billion to support
countries in the area hard hit by the crisis. Japan is giving
humanitarian aid to refugees, he said.
   His country's post-World War II constitution bars stationing
soldiers outside Japan's territory. Kaifu said his government is
trying to amend it to permit a non-military presence in U.N. and
international peace operations abroad.
   The prime minister said Japan may be able to provide civilian
monitors of free and fair elections and aid in Cambodia's
reconstruction under a U.N. peace plan.

   The chief of the Customs Department, Mahdi
Farhan, said Monday that Jordan stopped commercial traffic from
Saudi Arabia, but stressed that Jordan was not closing down its
borders with that country.
   ``Jordan has stopped all trucks from entering its territory
through the Saudi border,'' Farhan said.
   He said it was in reponse to an unexplained closure of Saudi
borders to Jordanian commercial trucks Sunday.
   The development was another sign of the growing tension between
the two kingdoms because of Jordan's pro-Iraqi stance in the
Persian Gulf crisis.

   The Supreme Court said Monday it will use a
dispute growing out of a settled strike by Continental Air Lines
pilots to set new guidelines on unions' duties to represent their
members.
   The court will consider killing a lawsuit against the Air Line
Pilots Association by striking pilots who said their union denied
them fair representation.
   The Bush administration had urged the justices to hear the case.
   ``Uncertainty regarding the extent to which settlements will
expose unions to liability for a breach of the duty of fair
representation can only complicate the efforts of management,
unions and federal mediators to achieve negotiated resolutions of
those disputes,'' government lawyers told the court.
   A strike against Continental that began in October 1983 ended
two years later. In the interim, more than 1,600 pilots either
stayed on the job or were hired to replace the strikers, who
numbered about 1,000.
   The pilots union agreed to a settlement that let striking pilots
return to work on terms considerably less favorable than pilots who
flew for Continental during the strike.
   Striking pilots sued in federal court, accusing the union of
violating the Federal Railway Labor Act that governs employment for
railroads and airlines.
   A federal appeals court said the case should go to trial to
determine whether the settlement was ``arbitary and a breach of the
union's duty to represent its members.''
   Continental filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983 and has
undergone an extensive financial reorganization.

   Air Force Gen. Curtis E.
LeMay, who relayed the order to drop the A-bomb on Japan and said
the United States should threaten to bomb North Vietnam ``back into
the Stone Age,'' died Monday. He was 83.
   LeMay, who also directed the 1948 Berlin Airlift and ran for
vice president in 1968 as George Wallace's running mate, died of a
heart attack at the 22nd Strategic Hospital, said Sgt. Steve
Mahnke.
   An ambulance had picked him up minutes earlier at his retirement
home outside this base east of Los Angeles.
   ``He was one of the real American heroes of World War II,''
Wallace said. ``I am proud to have served under him in World War II
and proud to have had him on the ticket as a vice presidential
candidate in my third-party campaign. ... I will always count it a
high honor to have been his personal friend.''
   The former four-star general who built the Strategic Air Command
into a global strike force.
   Considered the father of strategic bombing, LeMay and his
tactics were instrumental in pressing the daylight bombing
offensive against the Nazis in Europe in World War II.
   LeMay was the architect of B-17 bombing formation tactics in
Europe, and later transferred to the Pacific where he organized the
B-29 bombing campaign against the Japanese islands.
   Years later, he said the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki were unnecessary to force Japan's surrender.
   ``We felt that our incendiary bombings had been so successful
that Japan would collapse before we invaded,'' LeMay said in a 1985
interview with the Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald.
   ``We went ahead and droppped the bombs because President (Harry)
Truman told me to do it. He told me in a personal letter.''
   But LeMay told the newspaper he felt the United States could
have defeated Japan in ``a few more days'' if it had continued the
firebombing of Japanese cities.
   After the war, LeMay was given command of the U.S. Air Force in
Europe. He was there in 1948 when the Soviet Union cut off ground
access to West Berlin. His management of the airlift that kept West
Berlin supplied brought LeMay much notice at home.
   He was named commanding general of the Strategic Air Command in
October 1948 and held the command until June 1957 - longer than any
other general.
   The 1955 Jimmy Stewart movie, ``Strategic Air Command,''
provided a glimpse of the strike force LeMay built. A
cigar-chomping Frank Lovejoy portrayed a character that displayed
LeMay's tough, demanding persona.
   He was SAC's second commander but was widely credited with
having built its bomber force to a formidable level.
   Within a few short years he transformed the largely demobilized
air arm into a global striking force that could deliver nuclear
weapons anywhere at any time.
   In a 1965 biography, ``Mission with LeMay,'' published in 1965
after his retirement as Air Force chief of staff during the early
years of the Vietnam War, h wrote that a solution to the war might
be to warn the North Vietnamese that they ``have got to draw in
their horns and stop their aggression, or we are going to bomb them
back into the Stone Age.''
   His reputation was that of a man who was equally unsparing of
his men and himself. He said he was unable to distinguish between
the unfortunate and the incompetent, and he tolerated little if any
error from his subordinates.
   But he would willingly do any job that he demanded of his
followers. He was as comfortable in a machine gun cupola as he was
in the cockpit. He personally led dozens of missions in Europe.
   One of many famous stories about LeMay was that he once found a
SAC sentry who had put down his weapon to eat a sandwich.
   ``This afternoon I found a man guarding a hangar with a ham
sandwich. There will be no more of that,'' LeMay's subsequent memo
said.
   He was promoted to full general while at SAC.
   After leaving SAC, LeMay became vice chief, then President
Kennedy named him chief of staff of the Air Force.
   LeMay retired in 1965, frustrated by the politics of the
Pentagon and by Robert S. McNamara, defense secretary under
presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
   McNamara had denied LeMay the B-70, which the general had wanted
as the successor to the B-52, and forced him to accept the F-111
fighter-bomber. In so doing, McNamara had subordinated LeMay's
coveted bombers to the new ballistic missiles.
   LeMay also grew angry over McNamara's restraints on U.S. air
power in Vietnam, a sore point for LeMay who believed in an all-out
war.
   At a news conference at which he was introduced as Wallace's
running mate, LeMay said he saw nothing wrong with using nuclear
weapons to shorten any war and, thus, save lives.
   LeMay had been living in Air Force Village West, a military
retirement community outside March.
   A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at the air base
chapel. Burial will be at the U.S. Air Force Academy on Thursday.
   He is survived by his wife, Helen, and a daughter.

<HEAD>San Jose City Council Member Loses Libel Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former San Jose, Calif., City Council member
who won, and then lost, a $1.01 million libel award against his
local newspaper lost a Supreme Court appeal Oct. 1.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that Claude
Fletcher failed to prove the San Jose Mercury News published
statements about him with ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless
disregard of their falsity.
   Fletcher sued the Mercury News over a series of 1984 articles
reporting on his conduct while a city council member and as a board
member of a local antipoverty agency.
   Fletcher's 1984 bid for re-election failed after the articles
were published. The articles reported that five agency officials
said Fletcher tried to steer a $1.6 million contract to an
insulation business in which he became a partner.
   The articles quoted the agency's executive director as saying
Fletcher once offered him and his wife a trip to Hawaii, which the
agency official interpreted as a bribe.
   A jury in 1986 awarded Fletcher $250,000 in general damages,
$25,000 in special damages and $735,000 in punitive damages.
   But the trial judge threw out the award, ruling Fletcher had
failed to prove the articles were published with actual malice - a
burden facing any public official who sues for libel.
   A state appeals court upheld the dismissal of the award, and the
California Supreme Court refused to hear Fletcher's appeal last
February.
   In its 1989 ruling, the appeals court said, ``The evidence
suggests a sincere attempt to report what the Mercury News viewed
as unethical behavior on the part of a San Jose public official.''
   It added, ``Clearly the articles contained factual errors. But
was there clear and convincing evidence that (the paper's reporter)
did not believe his story was true? We do not think so.''

<HEAD>Top Court Won't Let Newspaper See Some Pentagon Probe Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused Oct. 1 to let the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch see some confidential documents in the
government's corruption investigation of Pentagon contracts.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling that
the privacy rights of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the nation's largest
defense contractor, and some of its employees outweigh the public's
right to know more about the weapons procurement case.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear
arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   The Justice Department investigation, called ``Operation Ill
Wind,'' began in 1987 and has yielded more than three dozen guilty
pleas or convictions on fraud- and bribery-related charges.
   Among the contractors investigated was McDonnell Douglas, which
is based in the St. Louis area and receives some $9 billion a year
in Pentagon contracts.
   The FBI in 1988 conducted a search of defense contractor
offices, including those of McDonnell Douglas and its vice
president Thomas Gunn. Search warrants were based on information
the FBI obtained listening to wiretapped telephone conversations.
   The Post-Dispatch asked to see sealed documents related to the
warrants, particularly government affidavits that might reveal what
was learned by listening to the wiretaps.
   The Justice Department initially opposed making the documents
public but substantially dropped its opposition in December 1988.
The government, now siding with the newspaper, said it no longer
had a compelling interest in keeping portions of the material
secret since it had concluded part of the investigation.
   But McDonnell Douglas, Gunn and five unidentified employees
continued to oppose disclosure.
   A federal judge ordered parts of the documents unsealed. But the
ruling was reversed in February by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The appeals court said the absence of an indictment against the
company and its employees ``weighs heavily in favor of the privacy
interests and non-disclosure.''
   ``These search warrant affidavits implicate some individuals
directly in criminal misconduct, others only indirectly,'' the
appeals court said. ``Disclosure could seriously damage their
reputations and careers.''

<HEAD>Court Permits Libel Suit in Comparative Ads Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Oct. 1 refused to kill a
libel lawsuit stemming from advertisements comparing Blue Cross and
Blue Shield services to those of a health industry competitor.
   The court, without comment, left intt could send
U.S. Healthcare's libel allegations against Blue Cross and Blue
Shield to a federal jury in Philadelphia.
   At issue was whethact a ruling thaer some libel cases involving commercial
speech could be held to less stringent standards than others.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in reviving Healthcare's
suit last March, relaxed the rules for commercial-speech libel
cases.
   Since 1964, public figures - including most businesses - suing
for libel must prove that the sued-over statements are false and
were made with ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless disregard
of falsity.
   Private citizens suing for libel face a far less demanding
burden: having to prove only that the statements are false and were
made negligently.
   In ruling on Healthcare's lawsuit, the 3rd Circuit court said
the more stringent ``actual malice'' standard need not be arise over what
the agency is entitled to censor.
   Snepp worked for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1968 to
1976, working either in Vietnam or on Vietnam matters at CIA
headquarters in Langley, Va.
   In 1977, he published a critical account of the final days of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The book, ``Decent Interval,'' was
published without first having been submitted for agency
preclearance.
   The Supreme Court in 1980 ruled that Snepp's publication of the
book was a breach of his employment contract with the CIA and
ordered that he forfeit all proceeds from the book to the agency.
   The high court also ruled the CIA could continue to require
Snepp to submit any agency-related writings for prepublication
approval.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Taylor Sues National Enquirer for $20 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Elizabeth Taylor filed a $20 million
libel suit Sept. 25 against the National Enquirer, over articles in
the tabloid that labeled her as a heavy drinker with a disfiguring
disease.
   The Superior Court suit says the actress was hospitalized
earlier this year with a near-fatal pneumonia when a front page
headline June 12 screamed: ``Liz Docs Furious. She's Boozing It Up
In The Hospital.''
   The newspaper will not back down from the stories, Editor Iain
Calder said.
   ``All I can really say is we stand by our story, which we
investigated very thoroughly,'' he said, declining to discuss the
suit further on the advice of the newspaper's attorneys.
   The complaint alleges the Enquirer was notified about
inaccuracies in its stories and headlines four days before
publication.
   ``Both the cover headline, as well as the accompanying article,
are and were false, untrue, libelous and defamatory and were
published at a time when defendants . . . knew such allegations to
be false . . . ,'' the lawsuit said.
   The complaint also points to a Jan. 19 article titled: ``Liz's
Beautiful Face Ravaged By Killer Disease. Doctors Order Suicide
Watch After They Finally Diagnose The Mystery Illness.''
   The suit states that story suggested Miss Taylor had lupus, a
destructive skin condition.
   The story also said Miss Taylor had liquor smuggled into her
hospital room.
   The articles were ``outrageous and extreme conduct intended to
cause (Miss Taylor) to suffer great humiliation, mental anguish and
emotional and physical distress, and substantial loss of income,
with the sole purpose of improving sales of the National Enquirer
for the weeks in which the articles appeared,'' the lawsuit claims.

   Guy Gannett Publishing Co. said it will
close the Evening Express afternoon newspaper in February and merge
it with the Portland Press Herald.
   The last edition of the Express will be Feb. 1. Reporters and
editors at both papers said the decision was not a surprise. They
said the Express had been losing circulation steadily for almost 10
years. Its daily circulation is now between 22,000 and 23,000.
   ``While we're very proud of the Evening Express, changing
lifestyles have, for the past decade, caused an increased
readership of morning newspapers and a corresponding decrease of
evening circulation,'' Jean Gannett Hawley, publisher of both
papers, said Sept. 25.
   The new Press Herald will continue to publish Monday through
Saturday mornings and include many of the features now contained in
the Evening Express. The company also will continue to publish the
Maine Sunday Telegram, which has been produced by the Press Herald.
   The Press Herald has a daily circulation of 64,000 and the
Sunday Telegram has a circulation of about 150,000.
   The closing of the Express will leave Maine with only two
afternoon dailies, the Journal Tribune in Biddeford and the Times

<TEXT>
   A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, reportedly
threatened with ``bodily harm'' over his book that takes a critical
look at an obsession with high school football in Odessa, Texas,
canceled a promotional visit to the city.
   The book by H.G. Bissinger, ``Friday Night Lights,'' focuses on
Permian High School, where funds for film prints of its football
games exceed teaching materials for the English department by
$1,000 a year.
   The school won the Class 5A football championship last year and
has won the state title four other times since 1965.
   In his book, Bissinger refers to the alleged illegal use of pain
killers and to a pattern of apparent racism.
   Odessa police said they were aware of the threats.
   Lee Buice, president of the Odessa School Board, said the book
had angered some in the community.
   ``Mr. Bissinger has every reason to think he might face an
unpleasant situation if he came. I'm not sure that it would be
life-threatening, but I think he made a good call,'' she said.
   She said people were angry because they felt the book ``had a
significant impact in a decision made last week to bar Permian from
this year's state football playoffs.''
   The ban was imposed by the State Executive Committee of the
University Interscholastic League, which regulates high school
sports and other extracurricular activities in the state's public
schools.
   Bissinger is an investigative reporter at the Chicago Tribune.
When he was working at The Philadelphia Inquirer, he was part of a
three-person team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for a series of
articles on corruption in the Philadelphia court system.

   Cartoonist Richard Carr said in a column afterward that the

   About 3 percent of the school's 15,500 students are black.
   Carolyn Pione, the student editor of the newspaper, and another

<HEAD>California Reporters Protected in Civil Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporters can't be jailed for refusing to
provide notes, photos or news sources to people who sue one another
based on an eventthe reporter covered, the state Supreme Court
ruled Sept. 27.
   California's press shield law, which forbids holding reporters
in contempt for withholding confidential sources or unpublished
material, provides ironclad protection in civil cases, the court
said in a unanimous decision.
   The shield law was made part of the state Constitution by the
voters in 1980, in response to the jailing of several reporters for
refusing to reveal their sources.
   The court ruled in May that in criminal cases, reporters can be
required to testify or provide evidence if necessary to protect a
defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial. But the justices
ruled Sept. 27 that parties to a civil suit have no similar
constitutional right that can overcome the shield law.
   ``This is a complete victory for the journalists and the
public,'' said C. Michael Cooney, lawyer for New York Times Co.,
publisher of the Santa Barbara News-Press. The case arose when an
automobile company, sued in a 1984 accident, sought a News-Press
photographer's pictures of the crash.
   Michael Zuk, lawyer for the company, Volkswagen of America, said
the ruling would ``deny my client access to what may be critical
evidence in civil litigation.'' The voters who passed the shield
law did not intend to foreclose any evidence held by reporters that
could be essential to a civil suit, he argued.
   The ruling's main impact is on civil suits that do not directly
involve the news media, in which evidence is sought from a
reporter. If the reporter cannot be held in contempt of court, and
jailed until he or she testifies, there is little a judge or a
party to a suit can do to compel the testimony.
   The opinion by Justice David Eagleson said the party seeking the
evidence could sue the reporter, under a law providing a $500
penalty plus actual damages caused by a witness' refusal to provide
evidence. But Eagleson said the law was rarely used and would be
``virtually ineffectual'' in compelling testimony.
   In a case that has a news organization as a party, such as a
libel suit, the ruling has a lesser impact, because judges can take
other steps against parties who withhold evidence, such as deciding
the case in the opponent's favor.

<HEAD>Backers of Cable Controls Vow Tougher Bill Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of legislation to re-regulate cable
television prices and services say they'll be back next year with
an even tougher bill following a defeat in the Senate.
   On Sept. 28, Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., objected to bringing
the bill to the floor for debate or a vote, where it was expected
to pass easily. Faced with a possible filibuster, a sponsor of the
bill, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, declared the measure ``dead and
buried'' for the 101st Congress.
   Congress is expected to adjourn as early as the middle of
October.
   Backers of the bill said that the cable industry's victory might
be short-lived and that it would only strengthen the hand of
would-be competitors.
   Home satellite companies are itching to compete with cable and
are expected to push provisions of the Senate bill that would
guarantee them access to cable programming. Broadcasters also want
cable to pay for the programming it now takes virtually for free.
   ``There may come a time when the cable industry will devoutly
wish they had taken today's deal,'' said Edward O. Fritts,
president of the National Association of Broadcasters.
   The Office of Management and Budget had issued a veto warning on
the bill, which would have restored some of the government
oversight of cable that Congress lifted in 1984.
   OMB said that the bill imposed too many restrictions on cable
and that increased competition - perhaps from the telephone
industry - was the answer to any problems in the cable industry.
Basic cable prices on average have risen 43 percent in the past
three years.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Denied Meeting With Mohawks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson was prevented from meeting with
Mohawks holed up in a drug and alcohol detoxification center in
nearby Kahnesatake on Sept. 25, a day before the standoff ended.
   Canadian military officials said Jackson, who is host of a
syndicated television show, was being treated like any other
journalist when he was refused entry to the center.
   Jackson was accompanied to the reservation, about 18 miles west
of Montreal, by Kahnawake Mohawk Chief Joe Norton.
   ``The Mohawks in the detoxification center cannot get spiritual
or legal advice and, moreover, the Canadian and the world press is
denied access to them,'' Jackson said. ``This is undemocratic and
inconsistent with Canada's great history.''
   Canadian forces surrounded the treatment center Sept. 1 after
about 50 Mohawks, some armed, occupied the building. The standoff
ended Sept. 26 when the 22 people remaining inside left. Several
scuffles broke out as some of the Mohawks refused to submit to
questioning afterward. There were no serious injuries.

   CBS is determined not to be shaken if
there is a replay of last year's World Series earthquake.
   The quake rocked San Francisco's Candlestick Park, where the
third game of the 1989 World Series was just getting under way last
Oct. 17.
   ABC, which broadcast the championship series last year, didn't
have a backup power supply and lost all video from the stadium for
about 30 minutes.
   CBS promises it won't be caught in the dark during upcoming
playoff American League Championship Series telecasts from Oakland.
   The network will lug a generator to the Coliseum for a standby
power source in the event of a disaster similar to last season's
temblor.
   ``We will be self-sufficient in Oakland,'' said producer Rick
LaCivita. Playoff games are scheduled in Oakland Oct. 9, 10 and 11.

   President Bush and key lawmakers avoided a
crisis as the new fiscal year dawned today but they now must
convince an election-year Congress to vote for $134 billion in new
taxes and widespread cuts in federal programs.
   ``It's a tough sale,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, one of many
lawmakers who was troubled by what he was hearing of the package
Sunday.
   Democrats, too, were expected to swallow hard before agreeing to
raising Medicare premiums while cutting the benefits, increasing
taxes on gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes, and trimming everything
from defense to student loans.
   And despite a claimed $500 billion in deficit reduction, it
would stretch out the goal of a balanced budget and let the
national debt increase another $1 trillion.

   WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) - Boston Celtics rookie Dee Brown, forced
from a car by police and ordered to lie on the ground at gunpoint
in a case of mistaken identity, is thinking twice about moving to
this wealthy, mostly white suburb.
   The basketball team's top draft choice is black, 21 and fresh
out of Jacksonville State in Florida, where he heard of Boston's
reputation for racism.
   ``When you think of towns up North and you think of racism, you
think of Boston,'' Brown said.
   Wellesley police converged on Brown and his fiancee, who is
white, as they sat in a parked car Sept. 21 across from a bank that
had been robbed of about $1,700 a few days before.
   Police arrived after a bank employee saw Brown and reported he
could be the robber. Brown, who is 6-1, said he was forced from the
car by at least five officers, told to lie face down on the
pavement and had guns pointed at his head before his identity was
confirmed and the two were freed.

   They say the military government's refusal to declare an

obtaining and distributing the million tons of food necessary to
head off the famine.
   They say up to 8 million Sudanese are at risk, and that the
famine is expected to peak by April. Some people already are
starving.
   ``This famine will be worse than (the Ethiopian-Sudanese famine
of) 1984-85 and the conditions to relieve it are 100 times worse,''
said a Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Scottish Teacher in ``Head of the Class'' A Hoot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a lot of babble about unconventional TV
shows nowadays, mainly by people who talk about but don't watch
``Twin Peaks.'' But there are some truly unconventional shows
about.
   Case in point: ABC's veteran Tuesday series about high school
life, ``Head of the Class,'' which began its fifth season last
month. It's well-crafted, literate - and even funny.
   This can't be said of the newer high school sitcoms, NBC's
``Ferris Bueller'' and Fox's ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose.'' They're
so conventional that the students are smarter than their teachers
and high school principals.
   ABC's ``Class,'' on the other hand, is set in an honors program
class, its students are there to learn, and, as in the earlier era
of ABC's long-running ``Welcome Back, Kotter,'' the teacher knows
more than they do.
   If you haven't yet seen this season's ``Class,'' you might take
a look tonight, because it has yet another unconventional touch - a
new history teacher from Scotland played by comedian Billy
Connolly.
   Connolly, who even is from Scotland, brings a wonderful warmth
and exuberance to the show.
   Full of good will, with a musical lilt to his voice, he belies
the rumor that all Scots are dour (the rumor started in 1746 after
the Scots and the English had a frank exchange of views at a place
called Culloden).
   As Oxford-educated Billy MacGregor, Connolly succeeds Howard
Hesseman, who played the original, more laid-back teacher, Charlie
Moore, but left to pursue ``various non-series projects.''
   In the ``Class'' premiere, Moore's departure was explained as a
sudden exit to take a shot at acting. As one student jokingly put
it, he left to be in ``a low-budget musical - `Seven Brides for One
Brother.' ''
   There is some resentment of the newcomer with the strange accent
and obvious eyes for the lovely vice principal (Jeannetta Arnett).
   Most of the resentment is by Dennis (Dan Schneider), the rotund
chemistry whiz who berates the class nerd, Arvid (Dan Frischman),
for taking such an immediate liking to the new teacher.
   But it's hard not to like a guy who not only knows his history,
but also describes the first westward rush of East Germans after
the Berlin Wall came down as ``a tangled wave of bad denim.''
   In tonight's episode, Connolly, who greets his young charges
each morning with a cheery ``Good morning, geniuses,'' has to cope
with the impact of a flu epidemic on a citywide high school
Shakespeare competition.
   There might not be an epidemic at his school were it not for
Arvid. Obsessed with maintaining a perfect attendance record, he
insists on coming to class, even tough he's so stricken by flu he
faints at the start of the show.
   This prompts MacGregor to tell him, ``You look like something
the cat dragged in, changed its mind, dragged back out again, came
back in, threw up, went back out, dragged it farther away, and
diiiiiiiied.''
   It's not said meanly, though, but in the caring tradition and
gentle humor of yesteryear's Kotter - who like MacGregor taught in
a New York school, albeit to a class that was, er, of a lower I.Q.
   There also are nice bits of byplay in ``Class'' between the
lovely vice principal and the new teacher, as when he agrees to
help out in the flu-ravaged Shakespeare competition.
   Assuming a Shakespearean look, he intones: `I would sooner mine
eyes be plucked from my head than deny thy lip's request.''
   She smiles sweetly: ``That's beautiful. But it's not
Shakespeare.''
   Yep, this is unconventional television. Don't know if it'll
survive. Why, the kids don't even say ``Surf's up.''
   But take a look at this ``Class'' tonight. You may enroll in it.

Ground,'' it's a collaboration by Moyers, the Center for
Investigative Reporting and San Francisco public TV station KQED.

<HEAD>Whatever Happened To Standards In The 1980s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States lost its financial bearings in
the late 1970s and 1980s, not slowly but in a rush, as if
institutions that once locked pennies away suddenly sought to force
millions on borrowers.
   Billions of dollars were sent abroad to earn the high interest
rates that less developed nations were willing to pay, while some
of the same banks were turning down American homebuyers seeking
mortgages.
   The money people claimed to know what they were doing too, that
as bankers they could tell a good customer from a bad one. They
were warned that loans to less developed countries could turn bad.
Nonsense, said many well-known bankers.
   Individuals saw the phenomenon in the form of letters urging
them to accept bank cards with ``built-in'' lines of credit, a
surprising turn, they mused, since the same bank wouldn't have
given them a dime a year or so before.
   And, as we are reminded again and again in these days of big
debt, budget deficits, rising taxes, bankuptcies, high interest
rates and recession-like economic activity, the people of the 1990s
will pay for it.
   In a discussion on corporate takeovers earlier this year,
William M. Kearns Jr., managing director of Shearson Lehman
Brothers, graphically compared the old days with the new in a way
that few in his audience could forget.
   Back in the late '60s and early '70s, he said, ``if Wall Street
was going to do a hundred-million (dollar) bond offering for
somebody like Exxon, they would inspect all that company's
properties.'' That was just the beginning.
   Then, ``representatives from all the major underwriting firms -
First Boston, Salomon Brothers, Goldman (Sachs) - would sit down
and talk with Exxon's CEO, CFO (chief executive and chief financial
officer) and other officers.
   ``You'd go through a `CIA' due-diligence study of a triple-A
credit in order to float a hundred-million-dollar offering.'' All
this for a relatively small loan to one of the most financially
secure companies in the world.
   ``Then we hit '86 or '87. A guy you've never seen walks into
your building and says, `I've got a million bucks. Can you lend me
one-hundred-million dollars?' And Wall Street would say, `Sure. . .
Step right over here.' ''
   Simon Business, the magazine of the University of Rochester's
graduate school of business administration - named for William E.
Simon, former Treasury secretary - recently published some of
Kearn's remarks revealing the extent to which standards were
lowered.
   Referring to the easy money, Prof. Gregg Jarrell asked him: ``So
the door was opened to corporate raiders?''
   Kearns responded: ``Yes - to black-hat guys who never should
have been financed by Wall Street.
   ``In those days, you didn't need a lot of money to buy a major
asset. Accessibility to money increased, either through banks or
through junk bonds. People were putting up 2 percent and borrowing
98 per cent.''
   In a typical deal, said Kearns, you could put up 10 percent in
equity, obtain secure debt financing on 50 percent to 60 percent,
and then, for the balance, offer unsecured, subordinated (call it
third-rate) debt to investors.
   That's the mentality and morality that led to savings and loan
disasters, the downfall of securities firms, a bear market, and the
shaky structure of many banks. It probably has led also to the
recession of 1990.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - America's military service academies have a
reputation for accepting only the top students, with thousands of
applicants rejected each year. But there's a way for students with
mediocre grades to join the cadet corps, especially if they are
minorities or good athletes. Almost one in five of today's cadets
are graduates of special prep schools.

   Eric Ver Hage, by his own admission, was a
lousy high school student and a troublemaker who earned ``almost
ridiculously low grades.''
   He finished near the bottom of his class of 310 at
Mechanicsburg, Pa., and didn't have enough credits to graduate.
   Six years later, Ver Hage is entering his senior year at the
U.S. Naval Academy, where he ranks in the top third of his class.
   A change of heart and a lot of hard work helped Ver Hage make
the transformation from high school goof-off to successful scholar.
   So did a $40,000, one-year prep school education financed by
taxpayers.
   Ver Hage, like generations of naval officers before him, is a
graduate of the 75-year-old Naval Academy Preparatory School (NAPS)
in Newport, R.I. It is run by the Navy solely to qualify students
for the Naval Academy and the Coast Guard Academy.
   The Army and Air Force have similar schools that serve as feeder
schools for their academies.
   The armed forces spend more than $20 million annually to prepare
about 800 young men and women for the service academies, while each
year the academies turn away hundreds of qualified applicants. In
fact, prep school graduates make up about 15 percent to 20 percent
of the cadet corps.
   ``We wire-brush them, get them all shined up, get the brass
looking good and then we deliver them,'' says Capt. Thomas P.
Danaher, director of the Navy prep school.
   Generally, the prep schools have gone about their business with
little interference from the outside. But now Congress has asked
the General Accounting Office to look at the three schools and
submit a report next year.
   ``Congress just wants to know if the schools are doing their job
well and if the money is being well spent,'' says James Schweiter,
a staff aide with the House Armed Services Committee.
   Some prep school students, such as Ver Hage, are late bloomers
seeking a second chance. Others are minorities whose grades and
test scores are too low.
   Still others are athletes recruited to play sports.
   Schweiter says some members of the committee have questioned
whether prep schools are improperly used to groom intercollegiate
athletes. The GAO study may answer that question, he says.
   The Navy prep school, the oldest of the three, began in 1915
with 13 enlisted men as students.
   ``It was a very small school to provide a commissioning path for
enlisted men,'' says John W. Renard, dean of admissions at the
academy.
   The original mission of the schools was to help men and women
from the regular Army, Air Force and Navy enter the academies. But
the role has been expanded in recent years to help athletes and
minorities qualify for the academies.
   Prep schools also offer a way into the academies for students
who do not follow the normal admission route, a nomination from a
member of Congress.
   Despite the cost, there is no talk at the academies of cutting
back or eliminating the prep schools even in a time of tight money
and dwindling military budgets.
   The academies are not short on applicants.
   At the Naval Academy, more than 12,000 applied for admission
this year. More than 2,000 of them qualified scholastically,
medically and physically for the 1,232 openings in the class of
1994.
   Renard acknowledges he could easily fill the class each year
without the prep school.
   ``But would I want to? The answer is no,'' he says.
   Students at prep schools may have had shaky academic records in
high school, but they are bright and often have the motivation and
leadership qualities that produce the best officers, Renard says.
   Officials at all three schools emphasize the importance of the
prep schools to their efforts to enroll minorities. They say prep
school graduates add a diversity that would not exist if the
academies restricted enrollment to the top scholars.
   The Air Force Academy ``just couldn't meet our minority
recruiting goals'' without the prep school, says Col. James Wright,
head of the Air Force Academy Preparatory School at Colorado
Springs, Colo.
   ``If you close the prep school, you eliminate a source of entry
to West Point...for soldiers, for minorities, for some females who
wouldn't otherwise have a chance to go,'' says Col. Jim Orahood,
commandant of the U.S. Military Preparatory School at Fort
Monmouth, N.J.

   ``You need all these segments of society,'' he says.
``Minorities don't come from the best schools as a group. We do
want to keep them in the mainstream of our military, and often this
is the best way for them to get in.''
   Orahood is a walking advertisement for the Military Academy
Preparatory School. The West Point graduate returned to Fort
Monmouth as its commanding officer 26 years after he graduated from
the prep school.
   ``I came from one of those small high schools,'' he says.
``There were 20-something in my class. I didn't know what a slide
rule was. I didn't know calculus.''
   The prep schools say their graduates often go on to become medal
winners, war heroes and top-echelon officers.
   Astronaut Loren Shriver is a graduate of the Air Force prep
school. So is Graham Shirley, who flew 200 combat missions in
Vietnam and rose to the rank of brigadier general.
   The Naval Academy prep school numbers among its graduates Vice
Adm. Joseph Metcalf, now retired, who commanded U.S. forces during
the invasion of Granada, and Vice Adm. Frank Donavan, currently
commander of the Military Sealift Command.
   All three academies use the prep schools to boost their athletic
programs.
   ``We would not be able to field the athletic teams that we do''
without prep school, Wright says.
   ``We need every little edge we can get because of the high
academic standards at the academy,'' says Jack Lengyel, Navy's
athletic director.
   ``If an athlete meets normal admission standards but the
academics are shaky, then we will offer the athlete the prep
school,'' Renard said.
   That was the case with John Casey, a junior from Doylestown, Pa.
He was asked to go to prep school when he was recruited to row on
Navy's crew team.
   ``That was fine with me,'' he says. ``I figured that would give
me a good background for my military training and boost my
academics.''
   Mark Smith, a wrestler from Holt, Mich., went the prep school
route because he made a last-minute decision to attend the naval
academy instead of Michigan State.
   ``I called the academy and they said they were interested,''
Smith says. ``They said they could get me into NAPS on short
notice. It was a great avenue for me.''
   By accepting appointment to the prep school, students commit
themselves to military service whether they go on to the service
academy or not.
   If they pass the course, they are virtually guaranteed
appointment to one of the academies.
   If they don't pass, they become part of the regular military
service as enlisted personnel.
   All prep school students take the same basic course - two units
of math, one of English and one of science. Students also begin
military training.
   Those who go on to an academy graduate at about the same rate as
those who enter directly from high school or college.
   Prep schools say their graduates tend to stay in the military
longer than other academy students.
   A study by the Army showed retention rates higher by 5 percent
to 10 percent at key landmarks such as five years, when academy
graduates can first leave the service, and 20 years, the first
retirement mark.
   Prep schools require applicants to commit an extra year of their
young lives to the military.
   ``My brother had gone that route. He recommended it,'' says
Chris Oddo, a junior at the Naval Academy.
   ``I don't think I had the grades to get in here first. I don't
think I could have made it here'' without a year at NAPS.
   Ver Hage says he did poorly in high school because ``I was
lazy.''
   ``Now I am the complete opposite,'' he says. ``I don't want to
miss anything again because I'm lazy.
   ``Academically, I learned an incredible amount at NAPS. NAPS was
my foot in the door.''

actors mouth have been grossly underpaid, compared with the people
in front of the camera. But that is changing now, with major
studios shelling out millions of dollars for scripts.

   Actor Michael Douglas wants $10 million a
picture. Tom Cruise commands just a little less. Arnold
Schwarzenegger collects as much as $12 million per film. Joe
Eszterhas recently got $3 million.
   Joe who?
   The screenwriter.
   A handful of working movie writers - whose median annual pay
floats around $39,000 - are starting to draw spectacular salaries,
with several scripts selling for $1 million and more.
   ``It's wonderful to have Paul Newman in a movie, but if he
doesn't have great words, he can't improvise them,'' says Ray
Gideon, who wrote 1984's ``Starman'' with partner Bruce Evans for
the then-unheard-of sum of $300,000.
   The movie studios still fawn more lavishly over actors, and even
director Renny Harlin (``Die Hard 2'') gets $3 million a picture.
   Although screenwriters are perhaps the most important ingredient
in a film's recipe, their compensation continues to be far from
commensurate.
   The Writers Guild of America says salaries across the board are
growing. All the same, many can't make a living at the craft. Half
of the WGA's 7,500 members have no writing income at all some
years.
   ``Writers are really starting to catch up, but they still are a
long way behind,'' says a leading Hollywood deal maker.
   That's the case even though star power doesn't necessarily
guarantee packed houses, as this past summer proved.
   The season's biggest hit didn't have million-dollar names such
as Tom Cruise, Eddie Murphy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce
Willis. The runaway smash was anchored by a strong script, and for
that reason long lines materialized for writer Bruce Joel Rubin's
``Ghost.''
   ``In the end, story is what people want,'' Rubin says.
   Most of the precious screenplay sales these days are for
so-called ``spec'' scripts, written on speculation of sale, not on
an assignment from a producer or studio.
   In frantic bidding wars, these scripts - and sometimes book
manuscripts, when no screenplay is yet penned - are auctioned off
to the studios and major independent producers.
   Even the Walt Disney Co., the stingiest studio, paid out $1
million in a deal for ``The Ultimatum'' and one other script from
its writers, and $1 million for ``Hell Bent...And Back'' by Doug
Richardson and Rick Jaffa.
   Selling spec scripts isn't a new way of doing business. Preston
Sturges sold 1933's ``The Power and the Glory'' on spec and William
Goldman wrote 1969's ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' with no
guarantee of income. The new twist is the price.
   Veteran writers with strong track records on assignment earn
around $200,000, with another $200,000 or so paid if the movie is
made. For the spec gamble, the stakes grow logarithmically.
   This April, Shane Black sold his script for the action movie
``The Last Boy Scout'' to music mogul David Geffen for $1.75
million. Black had a better offer ($2.25 million from Carolco
Pictures) but chose Geffen because he preferred Geffen's producer,
Joel Silver.
   Previously, Black earned $250,000 for writing ``Lethal Weapon.''
   A fascinating account of instant Hollywood riches comes from
Brian Helgeland and Manny Coto. Talking on the telephone not long
ago, the two jokingly decided not to hang up until they concocted a
$1 million script idea.
   With their script completed, the agent for Coto and Helgeland
mailed on a Thursday ticking clocks to 20 industry executives with
the warning, ``The Ticking Man is coming.'' The script for the
pair's ``The Ticking Man,'' a story of a nuke-toting android, was
sent out the next Tuesday morning. It sold that night, for $1
million.
   In these bidding wars, some scripts age like vintage wines.
Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool wrote a script for ``The
Ultimatum'' in 1980, but couldn't sell it for a decade. Their
patience had a good price - the $1 million Disney deal.
   So warm is the script fever that some screenwriters without
recent hits - or even any real credits - are selling spec scripts
for astounding sums. Joe Eszterhas, a former journalist, sold
``Basic Instinct'' for $3 million, even though his latest movies,
``Betrayed'' and ``Music Box,'' generated only moderate box-office
business.
   ``It was ready to go into principal photography, more or less,''
Thomas Levine, a spokesman for Cexplaining the
extraordinary ``Basic Instinct'' purchase price. (The total costarolco,
said in 
for the film will be staggering. Star Michael Douglas will be paid
more than $10 million and director Paul Verhoeven will earn as much
as Eszterhas.)

<HEAD>HAMBURG, Germany: fatherland again.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Among them was Bechler, until then a loyal soldier and a loyal
Nazi. But he changed sides while a prisoner, he said later, because
of the traumatic experience at Stalingrad where Hitler had ordered
the outgunned, outmanned 6th Army to fight ``to the last man.''
   Bechler joined the Moscow-based National Committee for Free
Germany, comprising communists and disillusioned German officers,
that sought to demoralize the Wehrmacht. News of his defection was
broadcast by Soviet propaganda stations.
   The communist underground in Germany focused on his wife in the
hope of gaining an ally. She received hundreds of anonymous letters
denouncing the Hitler regime and was called on by mysterious
visitors.
   ``Knowing him, I did not believe them when they told me that my
husband had changed sides,'' she recalls. ``I thought this was a
provocation that could endanger my family. I thought above all of
my two children.''
   Under the Nazi wartime rule, even close relatives of people
found guilty of ``anti-state activities'' risked being sent to a
concentration camp.
   To ward off any suspicion of being a communist sympathizer, she
handed the letters to police who placed her home under
surveillance. When another uninvited visitor arrived, he was
arrested and executed in 1944.
   ``Like many others of my generation, I grew up with this kind of
patriotism that seems inextricably linked with thinking in terms of
black or white, enemy or friend,'' explained the silver-haired
author, now 76.
   The Nazis sentenced her husband to death in absentia for high
treason. When word of his defection passed through Wehrmacht
channels, the local commander urged her to divorce him. She
stubbornly refused. It meant ostracism for her and her children,
reduced food rations, exclusion from public schools and other
sanctions.
   Bernhard Bechler returned to Germany with the victorious Red
Army before his wife was arrested in June 1945 and charged with
murder in the execution of her communist visitor.
   Bechler told friends later he gave up an attempt to locate his
wife after he was told that she was a prisoner of the Soviets.
Their two children, whom she had left with friends, got a new
mother with his second wife.
   For Margret Bechler, the arrest meant 11 agonizing years in
seven prisons. She was among the last inmates of Buchenwald, the
former Nazi concentration camp, used by the Soviets for another
five years. Mass graves recently discovered in East Germany suggest
that thousands failed to survive Soviet-run internment camps.
   In 1950, she was turned over to East German jurisdiction and
sentenced to death as being responsible for the wartime execution
of her communist visitor. Only six of the 32 prisoners convicted
then for alleged war crimes escaped execution, including Ms.
Bechler, the only woman in the group.
   She was released in 1956 and moved to the West. She became a
teacher ``so I could be with children again after I had lost my
own.'' Among those helping her was her husband's brother, a highly
decorated former Wehrmacht general turned preacher in West Germany.
   Her husband had long severed all links with his family,
including his brother. Through a friend, Ms. Bechler obtained the
East German address of her son, who also had become a teacher. A
letter she wrote was sent back with a curt note that drove her ``to
sheer despair'', she recalls.
   ``We have the best possible mother since 1945, '' said the
typewritten note, signed by her son, Hans-Bernhard, and daughter,
Adelheid. It added ominously that ``competent authorities'' would
be alerted ``in case of further molestation by you.''
   ``You will realize that we were forced to sign this letter,''
her son told her after their reunion.
   Her son has already visited her three times in West Germany and
she has visited him and his family north of Berlin. He also keeps
in touch with his sickly father.
   ``That's a good thing,'' Ms. Bechler says. ``I don't want him to
lose his father because he found his mother.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The Motor City, Motown, Detroit was a legend of
the manufacturing world, a beehive that spawned wealthy suburbs
such as Bloomfield Hills and Grosse Pointe. But today its decrepit
center decays under the blows of poverty and crime. Yet there is
fight left in this Great Lakes city, which may become the free
trade link to Canada.

   At least a third of this city's population has
left since 1960 and a third of those who remain are on welfare.
   There is bad news everywhere. The per-capita homicide rate is
among the nation's highest, 60 per 100,000 people in 1989. In the
last decade, it has had the biggest population loss of all the
nation's top 15 cities.
   A federal grand jury is probing the police force's use of a
secret fund; the debt-haunted school system's students test below
the national average.
   Adding insult to injury, the Motor City and its suburbs lost 43
percent of their auto dealers in the past 11 years, down from 51 to
29, including the suburbs of Highland Park and Hamtramck.
   Some experts say that Detroit, a 70-percent black island
surrounded by mostly white suburbs, now faces the flight of
middle-class blacks.
   That defection is partly blamed for a preliminary 1990 census
count showing the city's population about 30,000 people below 1
million, costing Detroit money, prestige and a congressional seat.
   There has been a steady decline from a population of 1.67
million in 1960 to 1.51 million in 1970 to 1.2 million in 1980.
   The city, considered the country's sixth-largest until last
year, would drop to ninth if the contested 1990 count stands.
   Detroit is the quintessential big, industrial Northeast and
Midwest city, says Mark Neithercut of the Michigan Metropolitan
Information Center.
   ``It is clearly in decline,'' he says. ``The same thing is
happening in Baltimore. But it's greater here.''
   Wilbur Rich, a political scientist at Detroit's Wayne State
University and the author of a biography on five-term Mayor Coleman
Young, says the flight is a double tragedy.
   ``Why Detroit? It had so much going for it,'' Rich says. ``It
was one of the few places where a black could make a decent wage,
buy a house that wasn't attached. Living in Detroit meant success.
   ``We don't attract people anymore. People get on a bus now to
leave.''
   Not all Detroiters are packing up. Some, perhaps personified by
the 4-ton outstretched bronze fist of boxer Joe Louis that graces
the median along Jefferson Avenue downtown, are fighting back.
   ``I think Detroit has reached its lowest number of population.
It'll start to come back,'' says Paul Hubbard, president of New
Detroit Inc., an advocacy and community-action group founded after
riots in 1967 left 43 dead.
   Detroit has what suburbs need: workers, a water system, and
recent tony, waterfront housing developments. They are luring
people back, which may in turn draw back businesses, he says.
   The new U.S.-Canadian free-trade pact could make Detroit the
Midwest's major port, he says, ``if we take advantage of it. We're
headed in the right direction.''
   New Detroit is pushing free trade, which could be its biggest
success, Hubbard says. To date, major triumphs include breaking up
gangs that sprang up in the 1970s and nurturing more than 100
citizens groups that fix up neighborhoods or drive out the drug
dealers who lurk in Detroit's thousands of abandoned houses.
   There's been a resurgence of community groups rebuilding
neighborhoods in the past three years, says David Dasher of the
non-profit Michigan Avenue Community Organization, founded in 1975
to battle blight. It renovated and resold 22 homes in the past
three years, trying for a 10-percent profit to plow into the next
project.
   His group's west-side neighborhood ``is holding its own, which
is no small accomplishment. As long as people care, there's a
chance.''
   Mayor Young thinks the most pressing need is jobs, to counter
Detroit's high unemployment rate. Hubbard and Rich believe a better
school system is essential.
   ``We're putting more emphasis on preschool to break that welfare
cycle,'' Hubbard says. ``That's what the school system has to do. I
don't think they understood that until recently.''
   The 262-school, 172,000-student system was so indebted that the
state considered taking over last year to balance its budget. Bond
issues, approved by voters last fall, eased that, while making city
residents' total tax bill the highest of any Michigan city,
Cupidore says.

   Before the referendum passed, comedian Jay Leno, on national
television, poked fun at the system's $1 million
how-to-be-more-frugal study. Until 1988, school board members were
driven to meetings by chauffeurs.
   It isn't just money. An April attendance report showed that only
21 schools had 90 percent to 94 percent attendance each day. A
dress code took effect this fall, a measure to curb violence such
as the shooting of an Osborn High School student over his $135
jacket, and the slaying of a Kettering High School student who was
stripped of his coat and $70 sneakers.
   Mayoral spokesman Bob Berg says racism is part of the city's
trouble. ``The city's about 70 percent black; the suburbs are
white,'' he says.
   ``There are people who brag about not coming downtown in years.
They say it's not racial. But it is.''
   Detroit's black population soared from 28.9 percent to 63.1
percent between 1960 and 1980, census data shows. Detroit's 1980
black population was the largest among the nation's 10 major
cities.
   The racial divide between Detroit and its suburbs is deepening,
as it is in Chicago, Baltimore and Gary, Ind., according to the
University of Michigan's 38th Detroit Area Study, its most recent.
   ``The social segregation is astonishing,'' says Steven
Rosenstone of the Ann Arbor school's Center for Political Studies.
Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties are 92.2 percent white, compared
with 75.1 percent black in Detroit. Detroit's 20.6 percent
unemployment includes people who have given up looking for jobs. A
third of Detroiters surveyed lacked access to a car in good
condition, meaning ``blacks cannot get out to the better-paying
jobs.''
   ``I think things are going to get worse before it gets better,''
Rosenstone says.
   What Detroit needs is jobs, says Berg, explaining Mayor Young's
sometimes controversial strategies - knocking down a neighborhood
for a Chrysler Corp. plant, plans to demolish another neighborhood
to expand the airport and to exploit the free trade pact,
encouraging more riverfront development such as the downtown
Renaissance Center complex.
   Detroit is lifting itself from the doldrums of population decay,
auto industry slumps and a bad image, say Hubbard and Berg.
   During last October's Devil's Night, about 30,000 residents from
an array of community groups patrolled the streets to dampen the
annual arson spree.
   The Detroit Civic Center hosted 14 percent more business in 1989
over 1988, an increase to 8.4 million visitors. A survey of 24
major metropolitan areas by national accounting firm Grant Thornton
found Detroit's economy advanced in the 1989 fourth quarter to its
highest in five years.
   The racial controversy over a white woman heading the council of
a mostly black city ended with Maryann Mahaffey's election last
fall to council president.
   The Detroit Pistons, who play their home games 30 miles north of
downtown, won their second straight NBA champsionship.
   Ten years from now, Detroit ``will be more of an information and
service industry for manufacturing. We'll be more of a convention
industry,'' Hubbard says, stressing the need to shift from the
cyclical auto industry that has dominated and determined much of
Detroit's past.
   And the city might just make it over the 1-million mark in the
census count, Neithercut says.
   Berg says there are easily 30,000 Detroiters missed by the
count.
   ``I think all this is going to turn around. I think the movement
to the suburbs will collapse. You can't have a rotten core in the
doughnut,'' Rich says. ``The same economic forces working on the
city will work on them.
   ``People in the suburbs will realize they don't want those
overpriced homes and they'll reclaim the city,'' Rich says,
pointing to the so-called ``gentrification'' of Washington, D.C.
   ``Detroit is not going to be the Bangladesh of the Midwest.''

   Lenny Clarke is a fast talker, which might
explain why he was torn between politics and comedy.
   While in his early 20s, Clarke ran for mayor, city council and a
congressional seat in Cambridge, Mass. But he eventually chose the
tougher course and became a comedian.
   That's good fortune for TV fans. Clarke stars in ``Lenny,'' a
CBS comedy on Wednesdays about a Boston blue-collar Irish-Catholic
family that's one of the funniest new shows of the season.
   Lenny is not a man who suffers life's indignities silently. He
has an line on everything, and it's from his lips to your funny
bone.
   Clarke grew up in the Massachusetts stronghold of the Kennedys
and like them went through Harvard. But Clarke was on foot. ``Every
day I passed through Harvard yard on my way to high school,''
Clarke says.
   At the age of 13 he personally contacted Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill, former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and
got his father admitted to a local hospital which had a long
waiting list.
   As a student at the University of Massachusetts, Clarke
supported himself as a janitor in the mayor's office in Cambridge.
Then he decided to really clean up city hall.
   ``It was 1975 and my friends convinced me I should run for
mayor,'' he says. ``I was 21. So what the hell, I gave it a shot. I
was upset about the way they were treating the homeless and the
elderly. I lost, but I still cleaned up city hall as janitor. Then
I ran for city council and came in 16th out of 26. They only picked
nine.''
   Next, he ran for Congress when Tip O'Neill retired. ``By then I
was a full-time comedian,'' he says. ``When Joseph P. Kennedy II
bought a house in the district I dropped out of the race. I spent
$80, but I forced him to spend $2 million. I still got a few
write-in votes.''
   As Lenny Callahan in the CBS comedy, Clarke's a man who holds
down two jobs to support his wife and three children. He's got a
father whose opinions are more outrageous than his, an
independent-minded mother who's rarely allowed to open her mouth in
her husband's presence, and a good-for-nothing brother.
   The scripts for ``Lenny'' have been running longer than the
usual sitcom script. That's to accommodate Clarke's rapid tongue.
``I talk so fast everybody on the show's starting to talk faster,''
he says.
   On the set this day he's rehearsing a scene with Eugene Roche,
who plays his father, and Alice Drummond, who plays his mother. Lee
Garlington also stars as his wife and Peter Dobson is the brother.
   ``My father passed away, but having Gene around is like having
my father around,'' Clarke says of Roche. ``He's always there for
me. My sister saw the pilot and wrote Gene a sweet letter. And my
Mom approves of the woman playing her.
   ``The set looks just like my house growing up. And we're like a
big family on the show. We call everybody every day. I grew up with
four sisters, three brothers, Mom and Dad, and one bathroom.''
   As a former politician, Clarke also has a few campaign promises.
``I think CBS will go to first, and I think my show will be one of
the shows that turns it around.''
   CBS has been in last place in the ratings for several years, and
Clarke faces formidable ratings competition from ABC's ``The Wonder
Years'' and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' on Wednesday nights.
   Clarke has no children of his own, but says, ``If the show's a
hit I'll have kids in every room. My wife's the one thing that's
more important to me than the show. It's family first.''
   He met his wife while performing in a comedy club in Birmingham,
Ala. ``She's a red-haired Jewish girl named Ferd,'' he says. ``The
first week after I met her my phone bill was $600. I said I could
fly there cheaper. We got married a year to the day after we met.
That was six years ago.''
   It was about the time he dropped out of the congressional race
that Clarke decided to move to Los Angeles.
   ``My wife felt I had reached my water level in Boston,'' he
says. ``I sold out all my performances. She said if I wanted to see
how good I was I'd have to come here. I came out here and I
couldn't even get on stage. I got a few walk-ons for $20 a night.
   ``For the next few years I lived in L.A. and flew to Boston
every week to perform. It was the time of the air fare wars and a
ticket was $198. I made enough to pay for the ticket and live out
here. I once owed the airline $13,000 on my credit card. When they
started the frequent flier program I broke all the records. I sent
all my relatives to Europe and Hawaii, and I still have 30,000 free
miles left.''
   Clarke was discovered while making one of his rare Los Angeles
appearances by someone from Witt-Thomas Productions. Paul Junger
Witt and Tony Thomas were persuaded to go see him - and then Jeff
Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment.
   Sagansky immediately ordered a show to be created for Clarke.

<HEAD>Peruvian Volcano Threatens To Erupt Any Day, Villages in Danger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MACA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When water came to this drought-stricken
Andean village, it seemed like a miracle, but within a day it was
clear it was an omen of disaster.
   The water didn't come from rain. It surged from an underground
spring that started flowing through a crack in the village square
this year. Within a day, half the village was flooded and now Maca
is sinking into the Earth.
   The crack was the result of tremors from Sabancaya, a nearby
volcano that lumbered to life in August after several months'
dormancy.
   The 19,720-foot Sabancaya has been rumbling off and on since
1987. In late April it began spewing gases, ash and rocks, sending
up clouds over 3 miles high.
   More than 600 earth tremors a day kept farmers and villagers
jittery until the volcano appeared to calm down in June. But
vulcanologists now warn it could erupt any day.
   Sabancaya is 80 miles north of Arequipa, Peru's second-largest
city. Scientists say the city's 500,000 people wouldn't be
endangered by an eruption.
   But the people of the steep slopes and precipitous valleys
around the volcano have a lot to worry about.
   Mateo Casaverde, director of the Geophysical Institute of Peru,
says an eruption would send a massive landslide thundering down the
populated Colca and Siguas valleys, burying towns and fields along
the way.
   Thousands of tons of ice, mud and rock could shake loose from
Sabancaya and the neighbouring 20,790-foot mountain of Nevado
Ampato, he said.
   Casaverde believes the landslide could be of a similar magnitude
to the one that buried the northern Andean town of Yungay in 1970,
killing all 20,000 inhabitants.
   Lava from Sabancaya represents no real threat, however.
Vulcanologists say the lava has never flowed farther than 6 miles
from the crater in previous eruptions thousands of years ago.
   Several thousand farmers and their famililes live in the shadow
of Sabancaya in the villages of Maca, Pinchollo, Achoma and
Cabanaconde. They are the ones Casaverde pinpoints as the first
victims in an eruption.
   Despite having been evacuated several times, the villagers
always return to look after their crops of potatoes and corn and
their livestock.
   The known dangers are bad enough, but the geophysical institute
also fears what it does not know. It says it lacks equipment and
staff to predict when the volcano is going to erupt.
   ``We're not experts,'' said Leonides Ocola, who heads a team of
volcanologists in Arequipa studying Sabancaya. ``Just because some
of our members have been to universities doesn't mean we're
qualified to be studying the volcano. But if we don't, no one else
will.''
   And the longer villagers stay, the more they and their livestock
are at risk. Several thousand head of cattle, sheep and llamas have
already died from grazing on ash-covered vegetation.
   Residents are also suffering from respiratory illnesses like
silicosis caused by inhaling ash and sulphurous and carbon monoxide
fumes, which have darkened skies in the area.
   ``If you think about it, they're breathing the equivalent of
ground glass,'' Ocola said.
   The volcano is also threatening Majes, a $1.1 billion irrigation
project near Arequipa, one of the largest in the world.
   ``If it blows, I'm going to look for another job,'' said Rafael
Urday, head of operations at the 1.6-billion-cubic-foot dam that
provides water for the Majes project.
   Project coordinators fear an eruption could destroy miles of
canals, causing millions of dollars in damage.
   The Colca canyon, one of Peru's biggest tourist attractions,
would also be threatened by an eruption. The canyon plunges 11,220
feet, the world's deepest gorge.
   Nearby, village artisans embroider delicate and complex designs
on skirt and blouses. Llamas wander through picturesque villages
and ancient stone agricultural terraces.
   The Colca valley also is sprinkled with ruins from the pre-Inca
Huari culture.
   The influx of tourists, already cut to a trickle by fears of a
growing rural insurgency and highway robbery, would likely dry up
altogether if towns and roads are destroyed by an eruption.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Actor Feared He Couldn't Act Evil Enough</HEAD>

   Playing Lips Manlis in ``Dick Tracy'' was a
cinch, but Paul Sorvino worried that he couldn't act with enough
cold evil for the role of the mafia don in ``GoodFellas.''
   ``I think I was more attracted to Martin Scorsese and others
involved than I was to the part,'' says the rangy, moon-faced
actor. ``I never felt the part was sufficiently like me to be
really good in it. But I thought I would take a shot anyway.
   ``Most of the time when I read a part, I know I can do it, and I
know how to do it. Very rarely will I take an assignment that I
don't have a strong inkling about in terms of its playing. In this
case, I really didn't feel I had that kind of lethality that the
part called for. But I was willing to make the investigation into
my innards and come up with and strengthen that kernel of whatever
part of my personality that might exist.''
   The reviews indicate Sorvino's success. He has been praised as
the figure of stability, albeit evil, amid the trigger-happy
``GoodFellas,'' who include Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe
Pesci. Sorvino is Don Paul Cicero, who directs the misdeeds of a
Brooklyn mob over a 30-year period.
   ``It's not a matter of his actually doing it; he orders it,''
explained Sorvino. ``He does it with the same dispatch he would
order asparagus: `I don't want to see him again.' To have that kind
of stone-like internal persona must come out as absolutely
believable in terms of his remorseless, souless business.
   ``On the other hand, I had to retain a humanity, a love for
Henry Hill (Liotta), a love for my children and for all the right
things. An august gentleman in his middle years and then to his
twilight years, behaving as one should as head of a corporation.
Except that their product is death.''
   You'd think that Sorvino would have special insight into the
``GoodFellas'' world, having grown up in Brooklyn. You'd be wrong.
   ``I never had any truck with gangsters or tough people,'' he
said. ``Our lives were very different. I never saw beatings. I knew
these things existed, as we all did. There were certain gangsters
who lived in the neighborhood, but I never saw them, I never had
anything to do with them.
   ``I was like Ferdinand the Bull - 6 feet, 2 inches of poetic
sensibility. A good bit of athleticism and strength, but my ideas
were more about Keats and Shakespeare and Verdi and Pucci and
Constantin Stanislavski.''
   The husky Sorvino graduated from Brooklyn's Lafayette High
School and began acting in summer stock. His acting career failed
to take off because, as he once explained, ``I had the body of an
Olympic athlete but with a cherubic face. The look was off, so I
was hard to cast. I sang and acted in New York, but I was only
marginally effective.''
   With a wife and three children to support, he veered into
advertising and became an agency vice president. But after seeing
Jack Warden performing in ``The Man in the Glass Booth,'' he
realized he had to return to acting. By this time, the face and the
body seemed more compatible, and the jobs kept coming.
   Sorvino has appeared on Broadway (``That Championship Season''),
in TV series (``We'll Get By,'' ``Chiefs'') and in films (``Reds,''
``Oh, God!,'' ``Slow Dancing in the Big City.'') Often he has been
cast as a hoodlum: ``The Brinks Job,'' ``Bloodbrothers,'' ``Dick
Tracy.'' Never had he faced such a challenge as Paulie Cicero.
   ``That kind of deadliness is so antithetical to my nature that
it took me two full months to find it,'' he said. ``When I crossed
a mirror once when I was preparing, all of a sudden I saw that in
myself and I was startled. I couldn't believe that existed in me.
   ``I'm in good company, because that also existed in Shakespeare.
Otherwise, he couldn't have written those horrific villains.''
   Sorvino plans to pursue a less villainous endeavor: opera
singing. After two more films, ``Rocketeers'' and ``Life in the
Food Chain,'' he will make his ``re-debut'' in grand opera (he
appeared in ``Die Fledermaus'' with the Seattle Opera).
   ``I take two hours of lessons every day, five days a week,'' he
a. His favorite movie star as a boy: Mario Lanza.

<HEAD>The Artists: House of Collections</HEAD>

   The Garretts passed on to their heirs two
family traditions - collecting fine objects and adding on to their
mansion.
   T. Harrison Garrett bought carefully, but even so, his
collections had outgrown Evergreen House a few years after he moved
in in 1878. He either had to stop buying the coins, rare books,
prints and manuscripts, or build more rooms.
   So he added on. And on. A wing here, a library there, servants
quarters and reading rooms.
   Sixty years and a few generations later, the classic revival
house ended up as 48 rooms with a separate wing for the gymnasium,
school room and bowling alley.
   ``There are other big houses in the United States. This is a
little bit different because the house actually grew out of the
collections,'' said Susan G. Tripp, director of university
collections at Johns Hopkins University, which owns the museum.
``As the collections grew, they loved adding to the house to house
the collections.''
   The house museum reopened to the public last month after a
three-year, $4.3 million renovation to replace the heating, air
conditioning, wiring, plumbing and roof. The furniture was
refurbished by Sotheby's Restorations.
   The yellow mansion is a fine example of the way people of wealth
and culture lived in the early days of the 20th century in the
mid-Atlantic region, Tripp said.
   The Garretts' immense wealth was built on commerce and
investment banking. Two generations of Garretts served as president
of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.
   The family's passion for beauty and the arts is evidenced by
their collection of Tiffany light fixtures and glassware, a theater
decorated by Russian designer Leon Bakst, and a collection of Dutch
marquetry furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries.
   The former bowling alley is a gallery for an extensive display
of netsuke, inro and lacquer boxes, 18th- and 19th-century Chinese
snuff bottles, Chinese ceramics dating from 200 B.C. and Japanese
ceramics from the 18th to 19th centuries.
   Exhibition rooms on the second floor display a comprehensive
collection of Tiffany and Steuben glass, Rookwood pottery and 16
paintings by Dufy. Works by Modigliani, Degas and Vuillard are
scattered throughout the mansion.
   The house boasts a splendid bathroom where the window frame,
shutters, cabinet and water tank are gilded with 23 carat gold
leaf. The floors, walls and ceilings were finished in a marble
mosaic.
   ``People who visit love to see the grandeur of a house. People
come to see not so much each object, but the house as a whole,''
said Tripp.
   John Work Garrett, a career diplomat who inherited the house in
1920, continued the family traditions of collecting and enlarging
the house until he died in 1942.
   ``John Work Garrett originally was motivated to be a collector
of books and coins,'' said James Garrett of Baltimore, the
grand-nephew of John Work Garrett and a member of the board of the
Evergreen Foundation. ``He was particularly interested in books
that dealt with the natural world. They had a real appreciation and
desire to preserve wonderful things.''
   The estate is tucked away on 50 acres in the city, a few blocks
from Johns Hopkins University. The property and its collections
were given to the university on Garrett's death.
   ``The renovation was carried out in a sensitive way to the
intent of the wills of the last residents - that is be used for
future generations,'' Garrett said.
   ``Their motivation would have been for developing a collection
which would be available to share,'' he said. ``Throughout their
lives, they didn't specifically open the doors to the city, but
they did share their things with friends and acquaintances. They
did have performances by various theater and music groups that
sometimes were in residence, so they opened the house up to others
in that way.
   ``They were very thoughtful in what they chose to add to the
collection, the Chinese and Japanese works being an example, and
specific in certain areas of the book collection.''
   The reading room, added in 1885, contains painted panels
depicting each of John Work Garrett's diplomatic postings - Rome,
Berlin, The Hague, Paris, Rome, Argentina, Venezuela, Luxembourg
and Washington.
   ``He was interested in early voyages and travels. He collected
the maps the explorers used. He was a very fussy collector. People
asked why he didn't have a Gutenberg. He had looked for a wonderful
copy but it was a continual search for best one,'' said Jane Katz,
assistant director of museums for Johns Hopkins.
   Alice Warder Garrett, John's wife, had a passion for the visual
and performing arts. Under her direction, the gymnasium was turned
into a theater designed by Bakst, a Russian artist who dazzled
Europe with his imaginative costume and set designs for the Ballet
Russe. It is the only surviving theater designed by Bakst.
   The designs on the walls, the stage sets and decorations belong
to what is considered one of the largest and most important private
collections of Bakst's works. He decorated the walls and ceilings
with stencils based on Russian peasant motifs.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Los Lobos Return to Rock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seemingly poised three years ago to supplant
Ritchie Valens as the most successful Mexican-American rockers
ever, Los Lobos turned away. Now they're back to reclaim their
turf.
   ``The Neighborhood,'' a collection of bluesy rockers and pointed
social commentary, is the first the rock world has heard from this
East Los Angeles band since their cover version of Valens' ``La
Bamba'' saturated the airwaves in the summer of 1987.
   Most musicians would sell their soul for a hit of the magnitude
of ``La Bamba.'' Los Lobos acted as if they'd stumbled upon a
hornet's nest.
   ``We were becoming like a household word,'' said songwriter
Louie Perez. ``I was at the checkout stand and I could hear us
blaring out of a car radio. That's a real good thing, but it's
another thing you have to deal with. It's as scary being struggling
as it is equally frightening being successful.''
   The 15-year-old band reacted to stardom by recording ``La
Pistola y El Corazon,'' a collection of Mexican folk tunes. As
expected, it was commercial suicide.
   Los Lobos have a definite love-hate relationship with ``La
Bamba.'' In recent concerts, they've pointedly refused to play the
one song with which most of the general public identifies them.
   That's because it was a cover song by a band that takes fierce
pride in its own material.
   ``If it was one of our own songs, I think we would have felt a
lot differently about it,'' said singer David Hidalgo, who shares
writing chores with Perez and Cesar Rosas. ``For a lot of people,
that was all they were expecting from us. We were getting tired of
that and wanted to get away from it.''
   So, for the second time in their career, Los Lobos abandoned
rock 'n' roll - at least temporarily.
   ``I talked to people who said that it really took a lot of guts
to not chase after the heels of the big hit and to do something
that was not going to be a hit record but really said something,
really meant something,'' Perez said.
   ``We didn't snub our nose at success. We appreciate what
happened. In a responsible way, we put out a record of music that
was not known to people in the United States. It also gave us
enough time to take a little bit of a break, to cleanse ourselves
of things. To get back on track.''
   ``We personally needed to reaffirm our identity to ourselves as
well as show some responsibility,'' he added.
   In interviews, members of Los Lobos talk a lot about
responsibility - to themselves as musicians and to their community
as role models.
   Sometimes, it seems, responsibility weighs too heavily on this
band. ``The Neighborhood'' retrieves the sense of fun that was
missing from ``By the Light of the Moon,'' their last album of rock
originals, without sacrificing social conscience.
   You can't take a song such as ``Jenny's Got a Pony'' too
seriously, especially when a chorus of neighborhood kids are
singing in the background. Los Lobos also cover an old rhythm and
blues song called ``Georgia Slop.''
   ``We wanted to get away from the kind of deep, introspective,
narrative feel that `By the Light of the Moon' had,'' Perez said
``But we somehow gravitated to something we wanted to say. `The
Neighborhood' has a lot to say about the inner city and urban
life.''
   Perez doesn't live in East Los Angeles anymore, but his mother
still lives in the house where he grew up. The neighborhood has
deteriorated to the point where his mother has iron bars covering
her windows and makes sure she's home by dusk after visiting her
son and his family.
   The disillusionment that Perez and other band members feel about
their neighborhood is reflected in the new album's title cut.
   ``The accessibility and affordability of hard drugs in the
community is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the
neighborhood,'' he said. ``In the song, we take a particular family
and go from brother, sister, father and mother to show how one
family is torn by the social and economic struggles.''
   He calls ``The Neighborhood'' the most direct song the band has
ever written, but it's still in terms general enough so a listener
can feel it's his or her neighborhood the band is talking about,
not Los Lobos'.
   ``It's really easy for us being in an ethnic group - not so much
a minority any more - living in a very insular kind of community,
to write things that are directly out of our personal reality,'' he
said. ``We wanted to take things beyond those boundaries and
communicate an idea that we're all survivors.''
   Musically, ``The Neighborhood'' is a melange of folk, rock,
country and blues. One song even sounds vaguely Irish. John Hiatt
and Levon Helm lend their voices to a few verses.
   But listen closely to ``Be Still,'' a gentle Hidalgo and
Perez-penned ballad. It may represent an important middle ground
for a band that's won a Grammy for its Mexican recordings, yet also
plays for fist-pumping rock fans.
   ``That was the last song we wrote for this record and it seems
that might be a new direction that might be leading to something
else,'' Hidalgo said. ``That was the first time we successfully
used traditional Mexican rhythms with English lyrics.
   ``It's a combination of rock and traditional. Little by little,
they're moving closer together.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Found Writer From the Lost Generation</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobody from the Lost Generation of American
expatriate writers has been more lost than Robert McAlmon.
   He squandered fame, fortune and friends during the 1920s in
Paris. He lost the manuscript of his major work, ``Family
Panorama,'' and practically all his belongings fleeing the Nazi
occupation in 1940. And, somewhere near oblivion, McAlmon lost his
life - to alcohol - at Desert Hot Springs, Calif., on Feb. 2, 1956.
   McAlmon, the last of the Lost, is the one whose life most
exactly fulfilled Gertrude Stein's prophecy that his generation was
indeed lost.
   But as Ernest Hemingway replied to Stein, ``the sun also
rises.'' It is rising finally for McAlmon 35 years after his death
with the publication for the first time in the United States of his
two surviving novels, ``Village'' and ``Post-Adolescence.''
   The University of New Mexico Press, with the prodding and
editing of English doctoral candidate Edward N.S. Lorusso, sold out
it first printing of ``Village'' in a few months this summer and
is going into a second printing. ``Post-Adolescence,'' and about 20
McAlmon short stories will be published next year.
   ``At this point, McAlmon is a discovery,'' Lorusso says. ``Most
people have only known him as a footnote to the story of the Lost
Generation, more of a social figure than a literary figure, and
that may change.''
   The spare, straightforward ``Village'' is a series of loosely
linked sketches set in the fictional town of Wentworth, N.D.,
around the turn of the century. Turning the century is precisely
what McAlmon set out to do, Lorusso says.
   ``There is a difference between `Village' and `Winesburg, Ohio,'
or `Main Street' that really does give McAlmon the edge,'' he says.
``He has one foot in the 20th century, I think, while (Sinclair)
Lewis and (Sherwood) Anderson are still sort of 19th century in
their approaches. There's sentimentality and a lot of judgment and
direction on how the reader should feel about characters, which
McAlmon doesn't do and which Hemingway also went on not to do. ...
It's left to the reader to make those kinds of decisions, and I
think McAlmon might really have been the starting point of that.''
   Like many American towns, Wentworth is made up of disparate,
desperate people who somehow nonetheless have a collective
conscience, consciousness and will. McAlmon's eye roves from family
to clique, quirk to eccentricity.
   ``Having grown up in a town very similar to the Wentworth of
`Village,' I think he (McAlmon) is very conscious of this fact that
the individual is robbed of his or her individuality because of
this collective consciousness.''
   McAlmon was born on March 9, 1896, in Clifton, Kan., son of an
Irish-born Presbyterian minister and the youngest of eight
children. The family moved from town to town and stayed mainly
poor, says McAlmon's nephew, George McAlmon, an attorney in El
Paso, Texas.
   ```Village,' that's the family. That's autobiographical as far
as I can tell,'' George McAlmon says.
   As a young man, Robert went to New York and became an artist's
model. There he met and married British heiress Winifred Ellerman,
who wrote under the pen name of Bryher. An odd marriage, as Bryher
was an acknowledged lesbian. When they divorced, McAlmon received a
large settlement which enabled him to establish a small publishing
business in Paris during the early '20s.
   ``If he has his rightful place, it's more often given him as a
publisher than as a writer,'' Lorusso says. ``He did publish
Hemingway's `Three Stories and Ten Poems.' He did publish Stein's
`The Making of Americans.' He did publish other things by H.D.
(Hilda Doolittle), William Carlos Williams and Nathanael West. It's
easy to see, yes, he was the one who started these people and got
them into print first.
   ``But as a writer, I think this is where he is likely to be some
kind of a discovery.''
   Lorusso says the missing body of McAlmon's work, including
dozens of short stories, must be resurrected in print so his proper
place in literature can be assessed.
   ``I think at that point we can decide objectively whether or not
McAlmon was the beginning of the whole new literary tradition, the
break from the 19th century, the break from the British English so
commonly used by people like Henry James and Edith Wharton.''
   His own generation of writers, with a few exceptions, already
had relegated him to a literary scrapheap, even though he had given
so many of them money, food and their first break.
   It had been McAlmon who paid for Hemingway's 1923 trip to Spain,
from which emerged ``The Sun Also Rises.'' He helped James Joyce
type ``Ulysses,'' editing and rearrangingportions of Molly Bloom's
concluding stream-of-consciousness soliloquy.
   ``He literally supported Joyce for a long period of time,''
Lorusso says.
   But when McAlmon wrote a memoir about the Paris period, ``Being
Geniuses Together,'' Joyce called it ``the office boy's revenge.''
   And when F. Scott Fitzgerald learned that Charles Scribners'
Sons might consider publishing McAlmon's ``Family Panorama,'' he
wrote to Scribners editor Maxwell Perkins advising him to pass.
   ``By the way,'' Fitzgerald's letter says, ``McAlmon is a bitter
rat and I'm not surprised at anything he does or says. He's failed
as a writer and tries to fortify himself by tying up to the big
boys like Joyce and Stein and despising everyone else. Part of his
quarrel with Ernest (Hemingway) some years ago was because he
assured Ernest that I was a fairy - God knows he shows more
creative imagination in his malice than in his work. Next he told
(Morley) Callaghan that Ernest was a fairy. He's a pretty good
person to avoid.''
   Perkins passed.
   ``All those people he literally supported turned on him,''
Lorusso says.
   What was it about McAlmon, anyway?
   ``Honesty,'' says Lorusso, ``because he was willing to look
objectively at people around him, including himself.''
   Generosity.
   ``I think it's like with any kind of handout,'' says Lorusso.
``Maybe at first you're appreciative of it, then after a while you
become resentful. ...
   ``McAlmon had money, McAlmon had a press, plus with his own
personality he ended up alienating just about everybody. When he
tried to establish a foothold in America to try to get some of his
work published here, it all worked against him.''
   After McAlmon returned to the United States in 1940 with little
more than the clothes he wore, he took a job in his uncle's medical
supply business in El Paso.
   ``He got out of Europe just ahead of the Germans,'' nephew
George McAlmon says. ``At that time I was 16. I knew him pretty
well. He had a drinking problem. All those guys (writers) ... they
either went to AA or they died from it. He died from it.
   ``It was a sad existence for him. ... He wasn't doing any
literary work. He went downhill, lost a lot of interest. His
friends died. I remember him commenting on when James Joyce died.''
   He moved to California in 1953 to be near his sister, Victoria.
   Less than three years later he was dead.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Vince Gill Resurrects Career With a Weeper</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vince Gill has resurrected a sputtering
recording career with a classic country music weeper about lost
love.
   Gill was a little noticed singer throughout the mid-1980s who
finally asked to be released from his recording contract with RCA
Records in 1987.
   He went without a record deal until he emerged this year with
MCA Records and put out the acclaimed single ``When I Call Your
Name'' and the album of the same name. The LP is closing in on gold
status (500,000 copies sold) - or 10 times more than his three
previous albums.
   ``A lot of people figured I was done,'' the amiable 33-year-old
Gill said as he reflected on his lean years. ``Nothing major had
happened, and people started losing enthusiasm.
   ``I never doubted the fact that I had a hit record in me. It was
just trying to find it.''
   Gill found it with ``When I Call Your Name,'' which he wrote and
which has become one of the year's top country hits. The song
featuring a whining steel guitar and a compelling piano solo, tells
the story of a man who thinks about his lover all day and rushes
home to find a goodbye note on the table. Patty Loveless provides
backup vocals.
   ``It's the kind of song that gave me goose bumps,'' said Gill,
former lead singer for Pure Prairie League. ``It has a haunting
chorus and it's a very lonesome and sad song.
   ``When I first heard it, I definitely felt that if this was not
a hit, then I could throw my hands up and say I don't have a clue
to what is.''
   Gill said he treats records the way a casting director does a
movie: ``Every part is so critical. There are things that can
enhance them or detract and I think we made all the right calls in
what we did to the record.
   ``It really took off when Patty put her vocals on there. I just
love our voices together.''
   Even without his newfound success, Gill had fashioned a
rewarding behind-the-scenes career using his velvet tenor as a
backup vocalist for recording sessions. By his count, he has sung
on records done by more than 100 other singers.
   He was with Pure Prairie League from 1979 to 1983, recording
three albums and singing their hit ``Let Me Love You Tonight.''
   Gill, the son of a lawyer in Norman, Okla., grew up playing
bluegrass and country music.
   He was considering a career as a pro golfer when he chose to
join the group Bluegrass Alliance instead. He later joined
Sundance, then hooked up with Pure Prairie League.
   He arrived in Nashville with dreams of a country music career,
but found himself perceived as a pop singer instead because of his
stint with Pure Prairie League.
   ``I had sung `Let Me Love You Tonight' and been on `American
Bandstand,' '' Gill said. ``But I can't complain that I got to sing
a No. 1 pop record and met the Solid Gold Dancers.''
   He was able to launch his solo career but didn't meet with much
success until this year. His album has been near the top of the
country music charts and the single was No. 1 during the summer.
   ``It's been like Christmas a few months early,'' Gill said.
   He called on some old recording session friends to provide guest
vocals on the album: Loveless, Emmylou Harris, Reba McEntire, Herb
Pederson of the Desert Rose Band and Kathie Baillie of Baillie and
the Boys.
   ``I was there for their careers and helped their careers and
they seemed to have a similar feeling for me,'' Gill said. ``I
think it's a good calling card to have them in your camp.''
   The album includes dance hall swing tunes, rodeo songs and
contemporary pop music.
   ``We've got a real good chance to go gold,'' Gill said. ``We
even got on the pop charts for awhile. It's been fun.
   ``Looking back, I'm kind of thankful in a way that the success
didn't happen right away. That's real dangerous to go to the top
and be the rage. It doesn't allow time to build. The way down might
be just as quick.''
   He has no regrets about choosing music as a career instead of
golf.
   ``Music is more fun, much more creative. I love golf but music
is much more rewarding by writing songs and communicating with
folks,'' he said.
   ``That's the true God-given talent I was given. I don't think a
golf swing is my best blessing. I can sing a little better than I
can make a four-footer.''

<HEAD>Former TB Patients Remember Days in Saranac Lake</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Trudeau `Sanatorium' cq throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOEL STASHENKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The joy of life is what most people
recall about the years they battled death in Saranac Lake's
tuberculosis sanitariums.
   ``It was a very hopeful atmosphere, there was very little
depression,'' said George Conklin, 81, of Woodbridge, Conn. His
wife, Anne, moved with the couple's two children to Saranac Lake
when her husband contracted TB in the Navy in 1944.
   Mrs. Conklin remembered ``lots of parties'' in the village that
came to be known as the ``City of Sick.''
   ``We had parties for the people who lived here and parties for
the patients. . . . it was very cheerful,'' she said.
   The Conklins were among about 100 people at a reunion last month
of former TB patients who took the open-air ``cure'' in the
Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. Extended exposure to the
bracing mountain air and regimented bed rest was thought to arrest
the disease, which was brought under control by antibiotics in the
early 1950s.
   In the Trudeau Sanatorium and the private ``cure cottages'' with
rambling unheated porches, where patients would sit by the hour in
the mountain air, the goal was to get well.
   The enemy was a congestive respiratory disease that attacks the
lungs and other organs. So prevalent was TB in the early decades of
this century that it became known as the ``White Plague'' and,
experts say, many of those afflicted with it carried the stigma
that people do now who suffer acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Indeed, the AIDS crisis is blamed for a resurgence in TB. This
summer, experts at an AIDS conference in San Francisco were told
that TB has emerged as the world's biggest bacterial killer and
that scientists fear the immune system-weakening AIDS will again
allow it to become a major health problem, especially in Africa.
   Kenneth Ho, 67, of Syracuse, N.Y., said doctors tricked him and
other patients when lung X-rays revealed his TB infection in late
1948.
   ``You accept the news of the diagnosis: TB. Then comes word of
the therapy: a sanitarium,'' he recalled as he and about three
dozen other reunion participants toured the grounds of the former
Trudeau Sanatorium, which has been a training center for a
corporate management group since the early 1960s.
   ``The doctors fool you into accepting it. They say, `Well, maybe
you'll be there three months,' '' he said. ``It turns out to be
three years. It turns out there are people who've been there five
years.''
   Some patients stayed longer, though usually doctors tried to
move them from Trudeau to cure cottages to make beds available for
newer patients. The families paid for their stay, Ho said.
   Many of the one-time tuberculars said they were too young to be
daunted by spending several months or years doing, quite literally,
nothing.
   The motto of open-air ``curing'' was, ``Never stand when you can
sit and never sit when you can lie,'' the one-time patients said.
   Edward Burgeni, 76, of Greenville, S.C., said he ``worked out
all kinds of strategies'' to pass his two years of bed rest in
Saranac Lake, starting in 1934.
   Once, he recalled being chided by a doctor just for playing
chess with another patient.
   Time still had a way of going by, he said.
   ``People who were ambulatory would come in, the nurses would
come in,'' he said. ``Each thing was an event, a highlight. I would
tell you, quite frankly, that time did not wear heavily at all.''
   Burgeni said many people who survived TB were strengthened
emotionally. Others turned into what he called ``professional
invalids.''
   ``Some people used this as a stepping stone in life, as part of
a growing experience,'' he said. ``There were some people who found
in this life their mother, and they were afraid to get well. . . .
They never made the break to get out. Or, if they did, they would
return very promptly because the outside world was very
frightening.''

<HEAD>System Allows Seniors To Check on One Another</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some elderly residents can have a
watchful eye as near as their front door.
   Borrowing on the familiar ``Do Not Disturb'' signs found in
hotel rooms, two Rhode Island Crime Stoppers programs have started
in-house monitoring systems.
   Plastic cards are distributed to interested residents in senior
citizens complexes. One side of the card is blue and printed with
the words, ``I'm OK, A.M.'' The other side is red and reads, ``I'm
OK, P.M.''
   ``During the day, they put the card on the blue side, at night
they switch it to red,'' said Police Chief Robert Sasso. ``A floor
captain will check the doors every day. If the card hasn't been
changed, they'll call management.''
   ``We've had cases where people in manors have died and no one
knew for a while. This is an in-house system for them to check on
each other,'' he said.
   The program was invented by the late Doris Dubios, who was
president of the Riverside Village complex in Cumberland. It
started in Cumberland earlier this year and spread to neighboring
Central Falls.
   The cards cost about $1 each to print and there are about 1,100
targeted apartments in Central Falls. The money was raised through
bake sales, car washes and donations.

and his wife, Linda, take care of his 88-year-old aunt, Mini
Satterfield. They were the first to use the service.
   ``I was going out of town on a business trip, and had the chance
to take my wife with me, and at the time we really needed a
break,'' Perry said. ``And you can be gone and be confident that if
something happens, the appropriate care will be given.''
   The fee at Riverside includes three meals a day, housekeeping, a
television and phone, and a certified aide to assist with dressing.
Nurses supervise any required medication, and doctors are consulted
if a client becomes ill.

   New York manager Stump Merrill has stopped his
daily medical checks on Don Mattingly. Mattingly is feeling just
fine, even if it's way too late to the help the Yankees this
season.
   But there's 1991 and the Yankees, buried deep in the American
League East cellar this season, will need all the help they can
get. And that starts with Mattingly, their former All-Star first
baseman.
   ``The first couple of days back he (Merrill) was asking me how I
felt. Now he just puts me in there,'' said Mattingly, who has
rebounded the last three weeks after spending six weeks on the
disabled list with a bad back.
   Mattingly went 2-for-3 with three RBIs Sunday as the Yankees
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-2. Since coming off the DL earlier
this month, he's 16-for-42 and has hit safely in 11 of 13 games.
   Sunday's performance lifted his batting average to .260, far
below his career mark of .332. But he's demonstrated to Merrill and
himself he's ready for next year.
   ``As far as coming back off injury, I think I've accomplished
all I wanted to do, getting back and just playing some defense and
playing on a regular basis and knowing that I'm going to be fine
for next year,'' Mattingly said.
   ``That's really what I wanted to accomplish. I think it's been a
success.
   `It's a good step for us. Coming into next year I'll just keep
up with the work and stay with the routines and next season I can
play every day with it.''
   When did Mattingly know he'd be able to play again with his
back?
   ``Soon as I got all the information from the doctors, who
assured me that there was really nothing I could do to hurt it. I
just needed to keep up with my work and if I do exercises and
strength I'm going to be fine,'' he said.
   ``He's all right,'' Merrill said. ``If we get the question
answered before this season even ends so you don't go to spring
training with some doubts, it's great. He's worked hard on his
rehabilitation and gone about his business.''
   Jesse Barfield also had three RBIs Sunday, including a
bases-loaded double to spark a four-run fifth inning. Greg Cadaret
pitched four perfect innings of relief for his third save and Dave
Eiland (2-1) got the victory.
   Greg Vaughn hit his 17th homer of the season for the Brewers,
who are just above the Yankees in the AL East. MIlwaukee starter
Bill Krueger left after 1 2-3 innings with a groin strain and
reliever Tom Edens (4-5) gave up the four runs in the fifth.
   ``It was all-in-all a lackluster Sunday afternoon game,'' said
Milwaukee manager Tom Trebelhorn. The Yankees' big inning started
when Bob Geren, batting .212, walked and Alvaro Espinoza, hitting
.224, was hit by a pitch.
   ``You allow less than .220 hitters to get on base without
swining the bat, you set yourself up for something negative,''
Trebelhorn added.

   President Bush and congressional leaders
forged a $500-billion, five-year compromise package of tax
increases and spending cuts, giving Congress a down-to-the-wire
chance to block slashes in federal services due today.
   The package contained $134 billion in new tax revenues,
including new taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol and luxury
items. Medicare costs for the elderly and disabled were increased;
defense spending was slashed as well.
   The pact, described by Bush in a mid-afternoon Rose Garden
announcement, was likely to prevent a chaotic disruption in federal
programs that would otherwise have occurred when the 1991 fiscal
year begins Monday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The government's main economic forecasting
gauge plunged 1.2 percent in August, its steepest fall in three
years and an indication, one economist said, of ``nothing but dark
clouds'' ahead.
   Seven of the 11 components of the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Indicators were off, including stock prices and an index
measuring consumer confidence, the department said Friday.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The House voted to give President Bush
authority to triple the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil sale he
announced Wednesday, but a White House spokesman said he has no
intention of doing so.
   On a voice vote Friday with no dissent, the House raised to 15
million barrels the ceiling on test sales from the government
stocks after Energy Secretary James Watkins told lawmakers Thursday
a 5 million-barrel test was inadequate.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - Oil prices closed little changed in a quiet yet
volatile session Friday. Traders saw evidence that President Bush's
attempt to calm the energy markets was having some effect.
   The November contract for delivery of light sweet crude fell 3
cents to $39.51 a 42-gallon barrel Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after trading as high as $39.95 a barrel and
falling as low as $38.65.
   There was no news directly from the Middle East to influence
trading.

   PARIS (AP) - The International Energy Agency advised Western
nations to brace for a possible oil shortage but said there was no
immediate need to tap strategic reserves to offset the loss of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Echoing the conclusions drawn at a meeting last month, the
group's governing board said in a comunique Friday that rising oil
price rises were driven by ``extreme political uncertainty,'' not
short supplies.
   Supplies lost due to the embargo on Kuwait and Iraq's oil have
been offset by increased production by other nations, it said, and
oil markets remain adequately supplied.

   MOSCOW (AP) - President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, struggling to
maintain central control over Soviet political and economic life,
plans to transform 550 armament factories to civilian production,
his spokesman said.
   Gorbachev and top aides met Friday to complete the conversion
plan as representatives of seven Soviet republics agreed to bypass
central authorities in working out a new system of economic and
political cooperation.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament has been unable to pass a cohesive
reform plan, and on Monday granted Gorbachev extraordinary powers
to transform the national economy from a planned to a market
system.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - California adopted strict auto emission rules
to compel production of a new generaion of ultra-clean cars and

   The effort, announced Friday, is an attempt to grapple with
California's enormous dilemma: some of the wors air pollution in
the nation, a population of 30 million people, 22 million vehicles
on the road and few mass-transit alternatives.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Whitman Corp. announced it will spin off its
slumping Pet foods division, consolidate several of its operations
and lay off about 1,000 employees.
   The company said Friday it will take a charge against its
third-quarter earnings to pay for the program, which will cause
losses for the quarter and year. The reorganization is an attempt
by the consumer products conglomerate to cope with lagging
profitability.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Plans to rescue two United Mine Workers health
care funds, now staggering under an $88 million deficit, are
stirring anxiety among non-union coal operators.
   The operators fear a new industry-wide coal tax will be proposed
to bail out the troubled 1950 and 1974 UMW health benefit trusts,
which serve 127,052 retired union miners, widows and dependents.
   In March, U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed an
11-member commission to study the trusts. The panel, which has no
lawmaking power, will release its recommendations at two meetings,
scheduled for Oct. 11 and Oct. 17. ---

<HEAD>Higher Oil Prices Will Boost Farm Costs, But Crop Exports May Gain</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

   Soaring crude oil prices because of the
Persian Gulf crisis will mean higher operating costs for farmers,
but an Agriculture Department analysis says there is a brighter
side too.
   Exports of U.S. agricultural products are expected to rise as
recycled oil dollars whet the appetites of overseas buyers.
   ``The shutoff of petroleum exports from Iraq and Kuwait has
raised the specter of rapid, destabilizing oil price increases,
perhaps by enough to spark a worldwide recession,'' the report
said.
   But the track record of previous oil price shocks in 1974-75 and
again in 1979-81 shows that U.S. agricultural exports do not
necessarily decline.
   ``Recycled petrodollars can, under the right conditions, boost
world demand for U.S. farm products,'' the report said. ``The
strength of this linkage, to a large degree, depends on the
monetary policies adopted by the industrialized countries.''
   According to USDA researchers, if oil prices were to average $25
per barrel in 1990 and continue up at a 12 percent annual rate, the
value of U.S. agricultural exports would rise $1 billion to $3
billion over the next three years.
   The lower value in the range would reflect tight monetary
policies, while the higher value assumes that more
``accommodative'' policies will be adopted.
   In another report - both were in the October issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine - the department's Economic Research
Service said farmers are not only seeing higher fuel prices but can
expect costlier agricultural chemicals and fertilizer.
   World crude oil prices jumped 50 percent within three weeks of
Iraq invading Kuwait, the report said.
   Further price increases have occurred. Last week, for example,
the November contract for light, sweet crude oil traded for as high
as $40.10 per 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
double the July price.
   The USDA agency, using computer simulations, said that while
farm chemical and fertilizer prices are rising, they will not do so
in step with the crude oil increases.
   Instead, the report said, those supplies probably will rise
about one-fourth the percentage increase in oil prices and would be
spread over 24 to 28 months.
   However, analysts cautioned that factors other than oil prices
will influence the costs of agricultural production items, or
inputs, in the coming months.
   ``Farmers' expectations of crop and livestock prices will help
determine acres planted next year and the demand for inputs,'' the
report said. ``All these factors will further influence chemical
and fertilizer prices.''
   But a review of trends over 28 years and computer models used in
the projections suggest that prices for agricultural chemicals -
including petroleum based pesticides - would rise 0.24 percent for
each 1 percent rise in crude oil prices.
   The initial 50 percent increase in crude oil prices, for
example, would generate a 12 percent increase in agricultural
chemical prices over the following 28 months.
   By the same token, August's 50 percent hike in crude would mean
fertilizer prices would go up about 13 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Chile has been officially declared by the
Agriculture Department to be free of foot-and-mouth disease and
rinderpest, two major cattle diseases that have impeded livestock
and meat imports from the South American country.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said last week that the absence of
the two diseases in Chile means ``some of our prohibitions and
restrictions on importing meat from Chilean cattle, sheep and
goats'' can be removed.
   ``However, we must keep in place a number of special
restrictions on imports of these meat products, and we also will
continue current restrictions on swine and pork products,'' he
said.
   Glosser said he doesn't expect Chile to ship much meat but
foresees the possibility of ``a new flow of llamas and alpacas''
coming into the United States under the liberalized rules.
   Special health certification, testing and quarantine
requirements have been developed for these animals, he said.
   Llamas and alpacas will continue to be quarantined at the Harry
S. Truman Animal Import Center, a high-security facility on Fleming
Key, near Key West, Fla., before they are allowed U.S. entry.
   Rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease are viral infections that
strike cloven-hoofed animals and are no threat to human health,
Glosser said. Rinderpest has never been known to occur in Chile,
and foot-and-mouth was eradicated in 1987.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An annual report by the Agriculture Department
shows the 1989 potato crop was worth a record $2.72 billion to
growers.
   That was up 27 percent from the value of the 1988 harvest and 61
percent more than the 1987 crop, the report said.
   Production, at 370 million hundredweight, was up 4 percent from
1988 but was down 5 percent from 1987.
   Prices paid to farmers averaged $7.36 per 100 pounds last year,
compared with $6.02 in 1988 and $4.38 in 1987, the report said.

   Stock prices partially recovered after a
precipitous fall today on expectations the government will take
action to support the stock market, traders said.
   Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen following
news of a budget agreement in Washington.
   The closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues finished
the day at 20,221.86, down 761.64 points, or 3.63 percent, from its
Friday finish.
   At one point the index fell below the key 20,000 level for the
first time in 3{ years.
   ``It's really snowballing. Everything, all that's bad is just
carrying over,'' one stock trader said during the slide.
   The Nikkei's fall brought it closer to 19,458 points, the level
at which it would have erased half its value from a peak of
38,915.87 points at the end of last year.
   Dealers said the fall was caused in part by uncertainty over the
Middle East, combined with continuing sales of stock by individual
investors.
   An estimated 400 million shares changed hands.
   In a report released today, Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. said the
continuing distress of Tokyo equity markets was primarily linked to
growing fears about the possibility of war in the Middle East.
   But ``second, and most ironic, the market is suffering from the
economy's strong momentum: above-potential growth and higher oil
prices together imply that central bank policy will need to tighten
further later this year to stem inflationary pressures,'' it said.
   Higher interest rates, if realized, would make stocks less
attractive to investors.
   Monday's decline was halted by a last-minute buying spree
stimulated by rumors that the Ministry of Finance would announce
new market support measures, traders said.
   In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 137.15 yen,
down 0.80 yen from last Friday's close.
   Dealers said the day's trading was mixed on news of a budget
settlement in the United States that might lead to lower interest
rates, as well as rumors that Iraq might be willing to negotiate a
compromise in the Middle East.

   Saddam Hussein's conquest of Kuwait has
sent economic shock waves around the globe, doubling oil prices,
plaguing stock markets, undermining business confidence and leaving
poor countries in Eastern Europe and Asia in dire straits.
   But it has brought windfalls for oil-producing countries who
will make billions of extra dollars this year as crude prices
climb. Since Iraq's invasion, they have gone from $16 a barrel to
around $40.
   Some analysts believe prices could pass the $65 mark before
long, fueling inflation and raising the specter of recession and
higher interest rates.
   ``The (Persian) gulf crisis is not only disrupting world peace
and security, it's also casting a dark shadow over the prospects
for world economic development and prosperity,'' Japan's Finance
Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, declared last week in Washington.
   The industrialized world was better prepared to cope with this
crisis than the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, despite inflationary
pressures. But the debt-ridden Third World faces a grim time.
   The Financial Times, London's respected business daily, said the
Iraqi invasion ``has put on hold hopes that the 1990s might usher
in a new world order, founded in the eclipse of Communism and
generating prosperity in which all mankind might share.''
   Among the hardest hit victims so far are the infant democracies
of Eastern Europe, who face a hard winter as they struggle to
reorient their socialist economies to the marketplace.
   They have been dependent for decades on cheap Soviet oil and
made little effort to develop alternative energy supplies or curb
consumption, which had been double that of Western Europe.
   Earlier this year, Moscow cut back on its oil deliveries because
of declining production and its own economic woes. Now Romania,
Poland and much of the rest of Eastern Europe - with little hard
currency to pay for increasingly expensive oil - are in deep
trouble.
   In Czechoslovakia, officials say they will not be able to cope
if oil prices hit $65 dollars a barrel.
   ``If that happens, we'd have to give up on economic reforms. I
guess we wouldn't be the only ones,'' said a Finance Ministry
official in Prague.
   ``If the price of oil goes as high as $50 a barrel, retail
prices will go up so much that gasoline will become a luxury
item,'' said Leszek Plotczyk of the Poland's state fuel monopoly
CPN.
   The United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq is squeezing
Baghdad, as intended - but it is also causing hardship to many
other countries, costing them billions of dollars in lost trade.
   Iraq owed $30 billion to $40 billion to the Soviet Union,
France, Italy and others. It was repaying some of that with oil.
Now that that flow has been cut, economists and government
officials say the debts are a writeoff.
   Some countries are hoping that the positions they stake out in
the gulf crisis - even if painful now - will pay off in the long
run. Turkey, which hopes some day to become a member of the
European Community trading bloc, has taken big losses supporting
the embargo against Iraq.
   ``This crisis will set a precedent as to how the West acts
toward its allies,'' said Turkish Central Bank Governor Rusdu
Saracoglu.
   Impoverished Asian countries like India, the Philippines,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as Arab states, have lost
billions of dollars in remittances from two to three million of
their nationals working in Kuwait.
   The cost of airlifting home the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who have fled Kuwait and Iraq has further drained their
treasuries.
   Few of these countries, already deep in the red, will be able to
cope with rising oil prices without substantial aid.
   In India, political analysts are predicting trouble for Prime
Minister V.P. Singh's already unstable government once the
financial effects of the crisis are fully felt.
   The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European
Community and other organizations have rallied to help cushion the
economic hardships caused by the crisis.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported that 11
countries have asked for assistance: Bulgaria, India, Jordan,
Lebanon, the Philippines, Romania, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen
and Yugoslavia.
   Japan has pledged $2 billion to help Egypt, Jordan and Turkey
bear the brunt of the embargo. South Korea says it will donate
30,000 tons of rice worth $10 million to these countries and extend
long-term, low-interest loans of $40 million.
   The EC has pledged another $2 billion.
   IMF and World Bank officials have said more money will be
available from oil producers, who are reaping hefty benefits from
high oil prices.

   Here are some of the countries hit
hardest by the Persian Gulf crisis, and their economic prospects:

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TURKEY: As one of the so-called front-line states, it will lose
an estimated $7 billion because of higher oil prices and reduced
exports and tourism by the end of next year. Turkey got 60 percent
of its oil from neighboring Iraq before the crisis and earned $300
million a year from Iraq in oil pipeline fees.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INDIA: India will lose $3.5 billion this year, said a senior
Foreign Ministry official in New Delhi. That includes $1 billion
spent evacuating Indian nationals from Iraq and Kuwait. Half the
185,000 Indians in the two countries have been repatriated so far.
   The cost of oil imports, 40 percent of which came from Iraq and
Kuwait, will rise by $1.5 billion to $6 billion a year. That will
drive the balance of payments deficit to a critical $5.5 billion.
Fuel prices were raised by 20 percent shortly before the crisis
broke, and another increase is expected.

<TEXT>
   THE PHILIPPINES: Few statistics are yet available, but Merill
Lynch said in its monthly Asian commentary that the Philippines
economy will likely be the hardest hit in the Far East. Manila
imports all its oil and high prices mean a severe drain on its
foreign currency reserves. Inflation is expected to increase by as
much as 5 percent to 16-18 percent this year.
   More than 15,000 of the estimated 93,000 Filipinos in Kuwait and
Iraq have been repatriated and thousands more are expected to need
return home. Apart from the loss of remittances, the returning
nationals will push up unemployment past the current 8 percent
total.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EGYPT: Officials expect Egypt can weather the crisis provided
aid is forthcoming, although it has a $50 billion debt. Prime
Minister Atef Sedki has estimated losses at $4.5 billion, including
$2.4 billion in remittances from the 1 million-plus Egyptians who
worked in Kuwait and Iraq.
   That total does not count $10 billion to $12 billion Egyptians
lost in Kuwait banks looted by the Iraqis, or writing off $446
million owed by Iraq.
   However, Egypt will earn an extra $1 billion this fiscal year
from oil exports. President Bush has asked Congress to write off
Egypt's $6.7 billion foreign debt.

<TEXT>
   BRAZIL: Soaring oil prices mean its import bill could double to
$6 billion a year. That will make it harder to pay off Brazil's
$117 billion debt. Fuel price increases will push up the cost of
living and there is already speculation of rationing, which would
slow down the economy.
   Brazil was Iraq's closest ally in South America, but economic
and military links have been sharply reduced. Brazil has not sold
weapons to Iraq since 1988 because of debts on previous arms sales
unofficially estimated at $3 billion. ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ROMANIA: Officials estimate the crisis will cost $3 billion,
including writing off Iraq's $1.7 billion debt. Baghdad was to
repay 70 percent of that in cheap oil. Now Romania, its Soviet
supplies curtailed, will have to pay out an estimated $770 million.
   Officials estimate that contracts with Iraq worth $1.2 billion
have been lost.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA: The embargo will cost Czechoslovakia an
estimated $1 billion and it will have to write off Iraq's $1.7
billion debt, mostly for arms purchases. The loss of these sales
will deprive the country of sorely needed foreign currency to buy
oil after the Soviets slashed deliveries by 18 million barrels this
year.

   POLAND: Warsaw has told the U.N. Security Council the crisis has
caused ``serious social and economic problems.'' Iraq was Poland's
biggest trading partner in the Middle East. Losses will total about
$2.4 billion for a country saddled with a $42 billion foreign debt.
   Warsaw was owed $500 million by Iraq, mainly for arms purchases
and cancelled contracts amount to $1.5 billion. Iraq was Poland's
main source of oil after the Soviet Union.
   Already hit by recession because of tough economic reforms,
Poland is highly vulnerable to high oil prices.

<HEAD>China Announces Record Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will harvest a record 422 million tons of
grain this year, providing the economy's lone bright spot amid poor
factory output and growing government debt, official reports said
Monday.
   The China Daily quoted Agriculture Vice Minister Chen Yaobang as
saying the grain crop will be about 15 million tons over last
year's record 407 million tons.
   He said good harvests also are exected in cotton, edible oils
and sugar.
   Chen's announcement comes as good news to the Communist Party
leadership, which typically emphasizes grain production on the
premise that a well-fed population is its best guarantee of staying
in power.
   During the past 18 months, the party has been under particular
stress from the collapse of Communist rule in the East bloc,
demands for greater democracy at home and deep divisions among
party leaders on how to respond.
   Determined to maintain stability in the countryside, at least,
the government last spring increased investment in land reclamation
and irrigation and made more credit available to farmers. It
recentralized the sale of fertilizer and pesticides, which had been
sold on the free market and were becoming expensive as demand drove
up prices.
   The government also renewed its insistence that farmers plant
more grain and fewer vegetables and other crops. Grain production
slumped in the mid- and late 1980s because farmers found they could
earn more by planting other crops.
   This summer, the government announced plans to raise its grain
purchase price but did not say by how much.
   It also said the state would buy the entire grain harvest, a
practice abandoned in the 1980s. In recent years the state
contracted with each farmer to buy part of his harvest, leaving him
free to sell the rest on the free market for a potentially higher
price. The arrangement was considered a first step toward market
reform.
   However, the China Daily said the government feared farmers
would not get good prices on the free market this year because the
supply of grain was so plentiful, and that would discourage them
from planting grain next spring.
   So far, the government has not announced any increase in the
price at which it sells grain to city residents, which has remained
unchanged for 25 years. City dwellers pay about 2 Cents a pound,
about one-seventh of what the state pays the farmers.
   Subsidizing grain has become a major drain on the state budget.
The China Daily recently said that by Western accounting methods,
the budget deficit this year will total $9 billion.
   State-owned industry has become another drain, with profits down
more than 50 percent from last year's level. A record number of
state factories are reported in the red.

   Victor Co. of Japan said Monday it will create a
new record company with the music division of the U.S.
entertainment giant MCA.
   The new company, formed between JVC and MCA Music Entertainment
Group, will market and promote the record labels MCA, Geffen and
GRP in Japan, according to a statement from JVC, manufacturer of a
wide range of audio equipment, records, compact discs.
   JVC spokesman Masayuki Murakami said the move was not related to
reports of a buyout of MCA by JVC's parent company, the consumer
electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   Murakami said the agreement will cover records and compact
discs; music videos were under negotiation. Among the artists that
record under the three labels are Tom Petty, Guns 'n Roses,
Aerosmith and Chick Corea.
   The deal gives Matsushita access to audio software while helping
MCA market its products in Japan, said Barry Dargan, senior
technology analyst at James Capel &amp; Co.
   The new venture, which will be owned equally by the two
companies and begin operations next year, also could help JVC
develop a market for digital audio tape, or DAT.
   Murakami said MCA approached JVC about the record deal, and
negotiations began last spring.
   ``As far as our talks with MCA are concerned, it was ... nothing
related to Matsushita talks with MCA,'' Murakami said.
   Last week, Matsushita confirmed it was holding talks with MCA
but refused to elaborate. Reports said the Japanese company was
considering a buyout of MCA, which includes Universal Pictures,
valued at $7 billion.
   Last year, rival Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, in large part to gain control over its rich library
of old films and television shows.
   Purchases of film libraries allow consumer electronics companies
to release old movies and television shows for the videotape
recorders they manufacture, and also provide material for future
high-definition television recordings.
   JVC originated the VHS video format, while Sony is a strong
backer of 8-millimeter video.

<TEXT>
   The 133-percent rise in the federal gasoline tax
included in the proposed budget agreement could be good news for
the nation, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca says.
   ``Our biggest economic need is lower interest rates, everybody
agrees to that,'' Iacocca said in a statement after negotiators
reached agreement on the program Sunday. ``This budget package
gives (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan the tools to make
sure we get them.''
   But other U.S. automakers, who have been wrestling with slumping
sales, rising gasoline prices and declining profits, were more
cautious when reacting to the greement reached this weekend between
congressional leaders and the Bush administration.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman Bill Noack said this morning that
company officials were reviewing the proposal. In the past, GM has
oppos, let the FBI keep parts of its
file on Todd Patterson of North Haledon, N.J., secret for
``national security'' reasons.
   When Patterson was an elementary school student in 1983, he
began an ambitious project - to prepare a personal world
encyclopedia. To that end, he wrote letters to representatives of
169 countries seeking information about their peoples and
governments.
   Patterson mailed his inquiries in envelopes bearing the return
address of Laboratory Disposable Products, a business operated by
his parents from their home.
   According to government lawyers, the large amount of
international mail generated by the project ``came to the attention
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation through classified means.''
   The agency opened an investigation, but it apparently was halted
after an agent visited the Pattersons' home and discovered the
nature and purpose of Todd's correspondence.
   Patterson, now a student at the State University of New York at
Plattsburgh, requested copies of his personal FBI file in 1987.
   The request, made under the Freedom of Information Act, was
denied. Patterson was told the files could not be released because
of national security reasons.
   Some information from the files subsequently was released, but
the rest remained classified.
   Patterson sued the FBI and an unknown government agency in 1988,
seeking full disclosure of the files and monetary damages.
   In response to his lawsuit, the government offered to expunge
his name from all FBI records. The offer was not accepted.
   U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin in New Jersey threw out
Patterson's suit last year after looking at the entire FBI file. He
ruled that the files properly were exempted from disclosure under
the FOIA.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that rulin last
January.
   In the appeal acted on today, Patterson contended that his
rights under the Privacy Act of 1974 were violated by the FBI
investigation.
   The law strictly limits government investigations into the
free-speech activities of U.S. citizens.
   The case is Patterson vs. FBI, 89-1731.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a
dispute from Arkansas over the power of states to tax cable
television companies and subscribers.
   The court said it will review a ruling that Arkansas may tax
cable TV as long as it also imposes the levy on similar
communication services, such as the unscrambling of satellite
signals.
   With millions of dollars in tax revenue at stake, the ruling was
challenged in separate appeals by both the state and cable
operators and subscribers.
   Arkansas in 1987 imposed its sales tax on cable TV service. The
law did not apply to those who own satellite dishes and subscribe
to services that unscramble satellite signals.
   Also exempted from the tax were all newspaper sales and magazine
subscription sales.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in February that the tax
unlawfully discriminated against cable TV service because satellite
service was excluded.But the state court said it is permissible
for the state to exclude the newspaper and magazine sales.
   ``We are unwilling to hold that all mass communications media
must be taxed in the same way,'' the state court said. ``We must,
however, hold, that a tax which discriminates between mass
communicators delivering the same service runs afoul of the First
Amendment'' guarantee of free expression.
   By the time the state court ruled, the Arkansas Legislature had
amended the law to extend the tax to satellite service ``and all
other distribution of television, video or audio services with or
without the use of wires.''
   The state court ordered Arkansas officials to refund to cable
operators and subscribers more than $8 million in taxes paid prior
to enactment of the amended tax.
   State officials, seeking to avoid the refunds, asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to overrule the state court decision.
   The cable operators and subscribers also appealed, urging the
high court to issue a more sweeping decision that the state may not
single out the electronic media for taxation when print media are
exempt.
   The justices in 1987, in a case from Arkansas, said states
generally may not tax some types of publications while exempting
others.
   The court, by a 7-2 vote, struck down an Arkansas sales tax
imposed on general interest magazines but which exempted newspapers
and religious, professional, trade and sports journals.
   The cases acted on today are Pledger vs. Medlock, 90-29, and
Medlock vs. Pledger, 90-38.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Oklahoma may collect a sales tax on cigarettes and other
items sold at a Shawnee convenience store owned and run by an
Indian tribe.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that would bar the
imposition of such a tax.
   Asked for its views, the Bush administration advised the
justices to send the case back to a federal appeals court for
further study. The justices ignored that advice.
   The store belongs to the Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe,
and is located on land held in trust for the tribe by the federal
government.
   Oklahoma law requires all vendors to collect from consumers
sales taxes of 6 or 7 percent - 4 percent for the state and 2 or 3
percent for local communities.
   The state also imposes an excise tax on the sale of cigarettes.
   The Potawatomis have never collected sales taxes or the
cigarette excise tax on items sold in their convenience store. In
1987 state officials assessed the tribe $2.7 million for the sale
and distribution of untaxed cigarettes.
   The tribe challenged the assessment in court, and U.S. District
Judge Lee R. West blocked enforcement of the cigarette tax pending
the tribe's lawsuit.
   West later ruled that cigarettes sold to tribal members could
not be taxed but that the tribe must collect taxes on cigarettes
sold to non-members.
   But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last November ruled
that the tribe does not have to collect any state or local taxes on
items sold at the store, even to non-members.
   The appeals court said Oklahoma officials wrongly relied on a
1980 Supreme Court ruling in a Washington state case to justify the
taxing of sales to non-tribal members.
   In the 1980 case, the appeals court said, ``the Indian tribe had
opted to come under state jurisdiction.'' It said, ``Because no
such jurisdiction exists in this case, Oklahoma's reliance on (the
1980 decision) is misplaced.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Oklahoma officials said, ``The
case turns on whether federal law has pre-empted state law or
whether state action has infringed tribal self-government.''
   The appeal added, ``The state simply suggests that the tribe may
operate its government in any way that it sees fit. However, if the
tribe operates a business in the state, it must obey applicable
state laws.''
   The case is Oklahoma Tax Commission vs. Citizen Band Potawatomi
Indian Tribe, 89-1322.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether savings and loan associations and other financial
institutions may claim tax deductions for ``reciprocal sales'' of
mortgage loans.
   With a reported $419 million plus interest at stake, the court
said it will hear Internal Revenue Service arguments against
allowing such deductions.
   Two federal appeals courts have ruled against the IRS and one
has ruled for the tax agency. The justices' decision, expected by
July, will resolve the conflicting rulings.
   An IRS victory would mean more bad news for some struggling
S&amp;Ls.
   In the lead case granted review today, a Greenville, Texas,
savings and loan challenged an IRS refusal to treat the sale of its
mortgage loans to another S&amp;L as a transaction that generated a
loss for tax purposes.
   Centennial Savings Bank, formerly known as First Federal Savings
and Loan of Greenville, entered into a deal with another savings
and loan in which it sold a package of interests in a group of
residential mortgage loans for a similar package of mortgage loan
interests.
   The thrifts were taking advantage of a rule adopted in 1980 by
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board allowing reciprocal sales of
depreciated ``substantially identical mortgage loans'' without
having to record a loss for regulatory accounting purposes.
   The rule allowed savings institutions to engage in transactions
to generate deductible losses for federal tax purposes without
worrying about failing to meet the bank board's minimum reserve and
liquidity requirements.
   In 1981, Centennial's mortgage loan portfolio was comprised
primarily of long-term home mortgage loans that had been issued in
the late 1960s at fixed interest rates significantly lower than
current rates.
   Because of the low interest they earned, the fair market value
of these older loans fell far below their face amount.
   Centennial had a tax incentive for disposing of the old mortgage
loans. Selling them would enable it to realize a tax loss based on
the difference between the face amounts and the sale prices of the
mortgages it sold.
   After the IRS ruled that Centennial could not claim a tax
deduction for the transaction, the savings and loan paid its
assessed taxes and sued for a refund. A federal judge ruled for the
government, but the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last November reversed the judge's ruling.
   The appeals court also ruled in cases involving savings and
loans from San Antonio and Temple, Texas.
   In seeking Supreme Court review, government lawyers noted that
the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled
that such transactions do not result in tax-deductible losses.
   That case involves the Cottage Savings Association of
Cincinnati.
   ``The IRS has advised that there are currently pending
administratively and in the courts 96 cases involving approximately
$419 million (excluding interest) that turn on the resolution of
the mortgage exchange issue,'' the government's appeal in the
Centennial case said.
   While the dispute was pending before the 5th Circuit court,
Centennial was found insolvent by the bank board and the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation was appointed as receiver.
The successor Resolution Trust Corp. then took over as receiver.
   The cases are U.S. vs. Centennial Savings Bank, 89-1926, and
Cottage Savings Association vs. Commissioner, Internal Revenue,
89-1965.

   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
libel lawsuit stemming from advertisements comparing Blue Cross and
Blue Shield services to those of a health industry competitor.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that could send
U.S. Healthcare's libel allegations against Blue Cross and Blue
Shield to a federal jury in Philadelphia.
   At issue was whether some libel cases involving commercial
speech could be held to less stringent standards than others.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in reviving Healthcare's
suit last March, relaxed the rules for commercial-speech libel
cases.
   Since 1964, public figures - including most businesses - suing
for libel must prove that the sued-over statements are false and
were made with ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless disregard
of falsity.
   Private citizens suing for libel face a far less demanding
burden: Having to prove that the statements are false and were made
negligently.
   In ruling on Healthcare's lawsuit, the 3rd Circuit court said
the more stringent ``actual malice'' standard need not be used when
the allegedly libelous statements were advertisements.
   The appeals court overturned a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Marvin Katz, who had dismissed the suit.
   As described by the appeals court, the underlying dispute stems
from ``a comparative advertising war between giants of the health
care industry in the Delaware Valley'' of southeastern
Pennsylvania.
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield fired the first salvos in 1986 after
losing some subscribers to the health maintenance organization
(HMO) offered by Healthcare.
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield ran what it termed a deliberately
aggressive and provocative comparative advertising campaign for
about six months at a cost of $2.17 million.
   Healthcare responded to that campaign by starting its own
comparative ad campaign and by suing. Its suit alleged, among other
things, defamation.
   The case is Independence Blue Cross vs. U.S. Healthcare,
89-1869.

   Oil and petroleum products prices fell on the
futures market this morning as traders sensed a more conciliatory
stance being taken by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Saddam today ordered the release of nine French nationals who
were believed to have been held at key locations in an effort to
deter an attack by Western military forces. The release comes a day
after Saddam praised French President Francois Mitterrand for
offering ``positive'' ideas on resolving the Middle East crisis.
   Light sweet crude was down $1.61 to $37.90 per barrel for
November contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange late this
morning. Other contract months were also trading lower.
   Home heating oil fell 3.22 cents to $1.027 per gallon for
November delivery, with other months also lower. Unleaded gasoline
dropped 3.56 cents to 95.15 cents per gallon on November contracts,
with other months also down.
   Natural gas contracts were down for all months, with November
delivery falling 1.5 cents to $1.92 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   ``This is just not a buying opportunity,'' said Thomas
Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.,
in Hoboken, N.J. ``Most important is a slight ease in tensions now.
It might be premature, but it's some type of hope that we haven't
been seeing.''

   Prices advanced broadly on Wall Street today
after the monthly purchasing managers report on the economy and a
federal budget-cutting agreement raised hopes that interest rates
will soon decline.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.35 to 2,491.83 as of
noon EDT.
   Advancing issues surpassed decliners by a margin of about 5 to
2, with 1,002 stocks rising, 432 falling and 389 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 94.99 million shares at midday,
compared with 100.47 million at the same time Friday.
   The monthly report on the economy from the National Association
of Purchasing Management, coupled with the long-awaited budget
accord announced over the weekend, raised hopes that the Federal
Reserve would finally allow interest rates to decline.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the approval of a deficit
cutting agreement would give the nation's central bank more leeway
in allowing rates to drop.
   The purchasing managers report, meanwhile, provided further
evidence of a weakening manufacturing economy. The purchasing
managers monthly index fell sharply in September to 44.4 percent
from 47.0 percent in August, the third consecutive drop.
   The market expected the report to put further pressure on the
Fed to lower rates as a means of stimulating the economy.
   Stocks also got some help today by a drop in oil prices. The
November contract for light, sweet crude fell $1.73 to $37.78 a
barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.
   Philip Morris led the NYSE most-active list, rising 1| to 46~.
   Among other blue chip issues, IBM was up 2 to 108&rsqb;, General

   America West Airlines on Monday announced
agreements to buy or lease 74 to 118 Airbus Industrie A-320s in a
deal worth up to $5 billion.
   Airline President Michael J. Conway said the carrier has lined
up 74 aircraft on firm order, including the lease of 16
immediately, and has options on another 44. Assuming the exercise
of the options, Conway said, the aircraft will be delivered over a
15-year period.
   Parties to the agreement include Kawasaki Enterprises, which is
to deliver 24 aircraft over a five-year period beginning in 1992;
Guinness Peat Aviation, which will supply the first 16 planes and
lease another 10 to America West through an affiliate between 1993
and 1996; and International Aero Engines.
   International Aero builds the engines for the fuel-efficient,
148-passenger jetliner.
   America West plans to begin A-320 service in January and have 16
in service by mid-1991, Conway said.
   He said as part of the agreement, America West received cash
advances, supplier and lessor support, and spare parts totaling
$220 million.
   ``This is by far the largest single aircraft order in our
history, and by its terms it makes America West a much stronger
carrier,'' Conway said.
   ``With long-term lease financing already in place for the first
50 aircraft, and a very strong up-front support package, our
company is in an excellent position to realize several
opportunities in the marketplace over the near term,'' he added.

   Ford Motor Co. on Monday issued three safety- and
emissions-related recalls and extended a transmission warranty
affecting about 606,000 civilian and 1,200 police cars.
   No injuries have been reported stemming from any of the
problems, Ford said.
   The automaker said it would replace heavy-duty steel wheels on
the 1990-model Taurus police cars because they could break apart.
The company said it has received one report of a cracked wheel and
would replace all wheels, including spares.
   The company also recalled about 144,000 1989-90-model Ford
Bronco and F-series super cabs with tip-slide seats to reinforce
the floor pan under the seats. The company said crakks have been
noticed in seats in about 10 percent of the trucks.
   Ford said it was recalling about 228,000 1986 Ford Thunderbird,
Mustang, LTD and Mercury Cougar, Capri and Marquis cars with
3.8-liter engines because of potentially excessive hydrocarbon and
carbon monoxide exhaust emissions.
   Finally, Ford said it would extend the transmission warranties
on about 234,000 1986-87 Ranger and Bronco II vehicles to six years
or 60,000 miles, or six months from the notification date.
   The company said a shift-lever housing could crack during a hard
shift into gear, which may freeze the transmission in the last gear
selected. Ford will replace the shift lever and housing in vehicles
where such cracks occur.
   Repairs or replacements will be performed for free.

<HEAD>Railroad Commission Votes Against Raising Oil Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Railroad Commission voted 2-1 Monday
against raising oil production in the East Texas Field by 8,000 to
15,000 barrels a day. One commissioner said the extra oil isn't
needed despite the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``There is no shortage of oil on the market any more. ... The
only thing hiking the price of oil is the New York Mercantile
Exchange, based on rumor,'' said Commissioner John Sharp.
   Sharp and Commissioner Jim Nugent outvoted Chairman Kent Hance
in keeping the East Texas Field production at 86 percent. The U.S.
Energy Department had asked the commission to increase production
to help offset oil lost due to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The commission in August voted to allow the production of about
20,000 more barrels of oil per day from wells outside the East
Texas Field. Most of the higher production is coming from fields in
the Austin Chalk in South Texas.
   ``All of the oil that was stopped from Kuwait and Iraq has been
replaced either domestically, by Venezuela or by Saudi Arabia,''
Sharp said.
   According to the Railroad Commission, the state produced 1.78
million barrels of oil a day last year, down from 3.36 million a
day in 1974 and 2.55 million a day in 1980.
   Many independent oil producers in East Texas opposed the
production incrnglish husband. An Americanized version of the British film
starring Dudley Moore, the show was started while the team was
still taking classes at BMI. Only later, when the musical was
nearly finished, did the two collaborators learn they couldn't get
the rights to the movie. They still haven't, but that hasn't
stopped them from trying.
   Ira Weitzman, major domo of the musical theater program at
Playwrights Horizons, spotted them at one of their many
presentations of songs from ``Bedazzled.''
   ``He was interested in us as writers,'' Flaherty recalls. ``He
said, `Show me what you have.' ''
   Through Playwrights, the team got a government grant and a lot
of encouragement to keep writing. Weitzman put them together with
George C. Wolfe, author of such off-Broadway hits as ``The Colored
Museum'' and ``Spunk.'' They collaborated on a musical called
``Antler,'' but it fizzled too.
   ``It was a good idea in search of a story,'' Ahrens says now.
   Then they wrote ``The Emperor's New Clothes,'' which was
produced as an hour-long children's musical by Theaterworks U.S.A.
at New York's Town Hall and later toured the country.
   Playwrights Horizons nourished their next show, ``Lucky Stiff,''
a non-stop musical farce in which the title character is anything
but alive.
   The musical had a short run at Playwrights Horizons in 1988, and
since then has had productions around the country and in Japan. A
Toronto company is pending for this season.
   Emotion was what Ahrens and Flaherty were looking for in their
fifth musical project. They found it in ``My Love, My Love'' by
Trinidad-born writer Rosa Guy. Ahrens discovered the novel on a
remainder shelf in a discount book shop. It eventually became
``Once on This Island.''
   The story, set in the French Antilles, is simple and sweet. It
tells the tale of i Moune, a dark-skinned peasant girl who falls
in love with a wealthy young mulatto. She saves his life, but he
marries among his own class. Ti Moune dies of a broken heart but
the gods take pity on her. They transform her into a tree to guard
the young man's home.
   The pair wrote ``Once on This Island'' in about six months.
   ``We made an outline of the scenes,'' Ahrens recalls. ``We said,
`This or that will happen here.' And then we just started coming up
with the songs. And the songs became the story.''
   Ahrens also wrote dialogue for the musical, but the team found
the show's energy level dropping whenever the characters stopped
singing and began speaking.
   ``It's not that we set out to musicalize everything, it's just
that's the way it evolved,'' Flaherty says.
   If they can, composer and lyricist work together five days a
week, usually three or four hours a day in either Ahrens' Greenwich
Village apartment or Flaherty's tiny East Side studio.
   Their newest project, musical No. 6, is ``My Favorite Year,''
based on the Peter O'Toole movie about a drunken movie star and the
young writer hired to keep him out of trouble.
   Act 1 is complete, as are parts of the second act. The book is
by Joseph Dougherty, writer of television's ``thirtysomething.''
   Eventually the team hopes to have a reading of the show, perhaps
at Playwrights Horizons, and then maybe shop it around to a
regional theater before braving New York again.
   ``It's a big musical with 12 principal roles,'' says Flaherty.
``It's got a real brassy, '50s sound to it. It's so much fun.''
   ``The show is what musicals used to be like,'' sighs Ahrens.
``It really belongs on Broadway.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Decide on Cable TV Tax</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version also on general news wires</NOTE>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to resolve a dispute over the
power of states to tax cable television companies and subscribers.
   Separately, the court also left intact a policy that allows
federally regulated banks to sell insurance and agreed to decide
whether U.S. businesses break the law if they discriminate against
Americans they employ outside the country.
   In the cable TV case, the court will review a ruling that
Arkansas may tax cable TV as long as it also imposes the levy on
similar communication services, such as the unscrambling of
satellite signals.
   A 1987 Arkansas law imposed a sales tax on cable TV service but
did not apply to newspaper and magazine subscriptions as well as to
those who own satellite dishes and subscribe to services that
unscramble satellite signals.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled the tax unlawfully
discriminated against cable TV service and ordered officials to
refund to cable operators and subscribers more than $8 million in
taxes paid.
   State officials, seeking to avoid the refunds, asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to overrule the state court decision.
   Separately, the court rejected an appeal by insurance industry
lawyers who said the Federal Reserve Board policy of allowing
federally regulated banks to sell insurance could lead banks into
the same ``morass that has befallen the savings and loan
industry.''
   In other matters, the court:
   - Will decide whether Congress intended a major anti-bias law to
reach beyond the nation's borders. The case involves a former oil
industry employee who was working in Saudi Arabia. A federal
appeals court said the law has no effect outside the country, but
federal trial judges have ruled otherwise.
   - Agreed to decide whether Oklahoma may collect a sales tax on
cigarettes and other items sold at a Shawnee convenience store
owned and run by an Indian tribe. The justices said they will
review a ruling that would bar the imposition of such a tax.
   - Left intact a ruling that USX Corp. illegally discriminated
against blacks at a Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill.
   - Let stand a ruling that threw out former major leaguer Jim
Bouton's $1 million damage award over a baseball Wrigley
subsidiary's bubble gum product that resembles chewing tobacco.
   - Refused to kill a libel lawsuit stemming from advertisements
comparing Blue Cross and Blue Shield services to those of a health
industry competitor. Without comment, the court left intact a
ruling that could send U.S. Healthcare's libel allegations against
Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a federal jury in Philadelphia.
   - Asked the Bush administration whether state ``lemon laws''
should be allowed to give buyers of chronically defective
automobiles more legal protection than they receive under federal
law. The court invited Justice Department lawyers to comment on
arguments by domestic and foreign car makers that such state laws
impermissibly conflict with federal law.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were sharply
down Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, as a result of increased
harvest pressures and declines on the precious metal and energy
markets.
   Wheat futures prices fell to levels from two weeks ago amid
doubts the Soviet Union does not plan to buy subsidized wheat flour
from the government, along with professional selling by major
companies and near-ideal harvest conditions, analysts said.
   ``There's a very weak export outlook to buy grains,'' said
Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
in New York. ``You're moving grains into positions to be sold and
you don't have any ready buyers, so that's going to push prices
lower.''
   Soybean futures pushed toward double-digit losses as major
corporations sold off their interest. Near-ideal weather conditions
in areas where the crop is grown also added pessimism the entire
harvest would be sold, Spilka said.
   Corn followed soybeans and wheat amid the same fears.
   At the close, wheat futures were 7} cents to 3\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.70a bushel ; corn was 5
cents to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.23 a bushel; oats were
1{ cents lower to { cent higher with December at $1.19{ a bushel;

   The stock market ran up a strong gain today,
encouraged by falling oil prices and hopes for lower interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 53.46 points to

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 among New York Stock

   The market expected the report to put further pressure on the
Fed to lower rates as a means of stimulating the economy.
   Stocks also got some help from a drop in oil prices. Crude oil
for November delivery fell more than $3 a barrel to just above $36

<HEAD>AmBase Corp. in Definitive Pact to Sell Insurance Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AmBase Corp. said Monday it has reached a
definitive agreement to sell its insurance subsidiary to a group of
European investors in a deal valued at $970 million.
   The deal, with Trygg-Hansa Holding AB, Sweden's second-largest
insurer, and the European investor group Vik Brothers
International, finalizes a tentative agreement announced in August.
   Under terms of the deal, which includes the brokerage unit
Gruntal Financial Corp. and Sterling Forest Corp. real estate
holdings, the acquirers will pay $507 million in cash and assume
outstanding debt.
   The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.
   The sale comes as AmBase, a financial services holding company,
faces lower earnings stemming from weak insurance results, a
decline in the value of its junk bond investments and a slow
banking business due partly to weakness in the real estate market.
   AmBase common stock was trading below $1 a share in late trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's bonds, however, were
up as much as $14 per $100 in face value.
   AmBase will retain Carteret Bancorp, leaving itself as a holding
company with assets totaling $6 billion and less than 2,000
employees. AmBase currently has $13 billion in assets and 9,400
workers.
   AmBase said in February it was putting its insurance operations
on the auction block to help boost its stock price and repay debt.
   Home Insurance, which was founded in 1853, is AmBase's largest
insurance company with 2,000 agents and brokers nationwide and $2.3
billion in gross premiums written in 1989. Most of its premiums
were in commercial and specialty lines.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - What's in a name? Plenty, if you're in the hotel
or motel business. Small, independent hostelries are fast
disappearing, unable to compete with the big franchised operations.
For one thing, people in the industry say, travelers don't like
surprises.

  eep the Henry Clay Hotel
alive.
   That's how Funerals help k bad business is at the 14-room hotel that
Alma
Jarrett's parents bought in their hometown 25 years ago.
   Most of the Henry Clay's guests aren't staying for pleasure.
Some of them are motorists who just got lost.
   ``Usually the people who come in here are coming to do some kind
of job, or they're here for a funeral,'' Mrs. Jarrett says.
   The story is the same at thousands of small, independent hotels
and motels across the land. They are being choked out by the big
franchised operations.
   ``The mom-and-pops are dying,'' says Frank Torres, franchise
coordinator of Econo Lodges of America, based in Charlotte, N.C.
``You have a lot of independents that are feeling the pressure. It
might be a good-looking pro 1988,
citing Iranian terrorism and subversion. The Saudis were one of
Iraq's main backers in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The meeting apparently did not go much beyond both sides
spelling out their positions. But it was the most positive sign yet
that the two countries may be moving toward a rapprochement amid
the political upheaval triggered by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The meeting apparently came out of a mediation effort by Syrian
President Hafez Assad, Iran's key Arab ally and longtime rival of
Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Assad, who is now also allied with the United States and Saudi
Arabia against Iraq, visited Tehran for the first time last month.
He apparently encouraged Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to
speed up efforts to end the feud with Riyadh.
   Healing the rift would help draw Iran into the anti-Iraq camp
and intensify Saddam's isolation at a time when U.N.-imposed
sanctions are believed to be having an impact and a U.S.-led
multinational force is growing mightier by the day.
   An Iran-Saudi rapprochement would be a major setback for Saddam
not only in his efforts to rally Moslems to his cause, but by
perhaps causing Iran to seal its long border with Iraq, making
sanctions more effective.
   Saddam has been courting Iran in efforts to puncture the U.N.
embargo.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, is keen to
end Iran's isolation and restore relations with the West and gulf
states.
   Rafsanjani faces powerful, anti-Western radicals at home who
favor helping Iraq confront the swelling multinational military
buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   But the diplomatic and economic gains Iran has garnered since
the gulf crisis erupted has helped strengthen Rafsanjani's hand.
   IRNA gave no timetable for a rapprochement. But it quoted Saud
as saying his country is eager to resolve the issue of how many
pilgrims Iran can send to Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine, before the
next pilgrimage season that starts in June.
   IRNA quoted Velayati as telling Saud that the main stumbling
block for resuming relations is the pilgrimage dispute.
   Prince Saud ``promised that his government will do its best so
that Iranian Moslems perform their rituals in a suitable manner,''
the agency said.
   In 1987, more than 400 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims,
were killed in what the Saudis said were Iranian-inspired riots in
Mecca, birthplace of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder.
   The following year, the Saudis announced a quota system that
restricted the number of pilgrims to 1,000 for every 1 million
citizens of Moslem countries.
   The Iranians protested the move, which would have cut their
contingent from 150,000 to around 55,000. They have boycotted the
pilgrimage since then.
   IRNA said Velayati stressed that Tehran ``is strongly opposed to
the presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf and especially
holy lands'' in Saudi Arabia.
   However, the Iranians have also condemned Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait and blamed him for bringing U.S.-led Western forces back
into the gulf.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Economy Hits Lowest Level Since Late 1982</HEAD>

   The nation's manufacturing economy last month
hit its lowest level since the end of the previous recession in
late 1982, according to a key business survey released Monday.
   The third straight monthly drop in the National Association of
Purchasing Management index provided more evidence of an imminent
recession and reflected increased prices from the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The group said its indexes for production, new orders, imports,
inventories and employment all dropped sharply last month.
Meanwhile, its price index shot up to its highest level since
September 1988.
   ``Coupled with sharply rising prices for petroleum-related
products spawned by the Middle East crisis, the immediate outlook
appears to be the worst of all combinations, a declining economy
with rising inflation,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the
group's business survey committee.
   The group's Purchasing Managers' Index, which tracks overall
business activity at 300 industrial companies, fell to 44.4
percent, down sharply from 47.0 percent in August. A reading below
50 indicates the manufacturing economy is declining.
   September's reading was the lowest since 42.8 percent in
December 1982, the first month of the current economic expansion.
The index stood at 46.0 percent a year ago.
   In other economic news, the government reported that
construction spending stalled in August after posting its first
gain in four months in July. Sagging consumer confidence and the
Gulf crisis were to blame, analysts said.
   A real estate trade group said the average American family's
ability to buy a home improved in August, thanks to a combination
of falling prices, lower mortgage rates and rising incomes. But the
National Association of Realtors said the improvement was curtailed
by the Gulf crisis and the general weakness of the economy.
   The purchasing management report, although grim, helped spark a
rally in the stock market. Coupled with the long-awaited federal
budget accord announced over the weekend, the report raised hopes
that the Federal Reserve would finally allow interest rates to
decline.
   David Wyss, chief economist with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc. in
Lexington, Mass., said the purchasing management figures were not
surprising because the manufacturing sector has been slumping for
more than a year. But he added that ``right now we're looking for
evidence of recession and this is certainly one more bit.''
   The manufacturing sector has been in what some economists label
a recession because of a decline in consumer purchases of durable
goods such as automobiles, a slowdown in non-defense capital goods
purchases and a decline in defense spending.
   New orders by companies fell for the third straight month, to
44.5 percent from 46.4 percent in August, the lowest level since
November 1982 at the trough of the recession.
   Thirty percent of those businesses surveyed said their new
orders declined from August, while 23 percent said they were better
and 47 percent unchanged.
   The group's production index fell to 45.1 percent from 48.5
percent in August, its lowest level since December 1982. A total of
29 percent of those surveyed said production declined, while 23
percent said it increased and 48 percent reported no change.
   The imports index fell to 45.5 percent from 47.5 percent, its
lowest level in nine months. New export orders, though, increased
for the 33rd straight month, with the index up to 54.0 percent from
53.0 percent.
   But Wyss said even the exports sector is likely to be pinched in
the coming months. ``Now with the oil shock hitting the rest of the
world too, that is likely to be slowing down,'' he said.
   Inventories declined in Septmeber for the 22nd straight month,
while supplier deliveries were slightly faster, indicating a
declining economy.
   Prices shot up, with 50 percent of those surveyed reporting
increases against just 6 percent reporting decreases. The price
index leaped to 73.4 percent in Septemer from 58.2 percent in
August, the biggest one-month gain since August 1975.
   Meanwhile, the group's employment index declined for the 19th
straight month at its greatest rate in five years, adding to the
sector's woes.
   The group said purchasers were concerned suppliers would use
uncertainty from the Middle East crisis to raise prices more, even
when increases are not warranted.
   In a special question on capital spending plans for the next six
to 12 months, 88 percent of respondents said their plans had not
changed because of the Gulf standoff, 8 percent said they were
revised downward and 4 percent revised upward.
   Of the 69 percent of respondents who said they had requested new
or additional credit since June, 96.5 percent said they had
encounted no difficulty and 3.5 percent reported tightened lending
conditions.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is a research
and education organization with more than 33,000 members.

   The stock market staged a strong rally today,
encouraged by falling oil prices and hopes for lower interest
rates.
   A monthly report on the economy from the National Association of
Purchasing Management, coupled with the long-awaited federal budget
accord announced over the weekend, raised hopes that the Federal
Reserve would finally allow interest rates to decline.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has said the approval of a
deficit cutting agreement would give the nation's central bank more
leeway in allowing rates to drop.
   The purchasing managers report, meanwhile, provided further
evidence of a weakening manufacturing economy. The purchasing
managers monthly index fell sharply in September for its third
consecutive drop.
   The market expected the report to put further pressure on the
Fed to lower rates as a means of stimulating the economy.
   Stocks also got some help from a drop in oil prices. Crude oil
for November delivery fell more than $3 a barrel to just above $36
a barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.

<HEAD>Saudi To Increase Output, Calls For Stockpile Dips By Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil Minister Hisham Nazer expressed
concern about spiraling oil prices on Monday and said Saudi Arabia
would continue to increase production.
   The kingdom has raised its own output by more than 2 million
barrels per day to help remedy the situation and ``will increase
its output at close intervals in the near future,'' Nazer was
quoted as saying before the weekly session of the Saudi government
chaired by King Fahd.
   ``There is no need whatsoever for panic to spread in the market,
since consumption in the fourth quarter of the year is estimated at
54.5 million barrels per day, with various sources capable of
providing 53 million barrels per day,'' Information Minister Ali
al-Shaer quoted Nazer as saying in a report on the cabinet session
to the Saudi Press Agency.
   ``The remainder would be no more than 1.5 million barrels per
day or 2 million at most, and that can be withdrawn from the
commercial stockpiles which are estimated at 700 million barrels at
present,'' Nazer said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the price of oil has reached as high
as $41 dollars a barrel for Brent crude and $37 for Dubai crude.
Nazer warned that ``the effects of such increases, if they continue
to escalate, will be grave for both developing as well as
industrialized countries.''
   He recalled the special meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries at the outset of the gulf crisis, when prices
were $27.50 per barrel for Brent and $25 for Dubai.
   ``It was a price far beyond what the market could absorb
economically or be borne by the developing nations,'' he said.
   With the Aug. 2 invasion, the market suffered a shortfall of 4.5
million barrels per day that the two countries used to export.
   Nazer noted that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter,
had raised its oil by ``more than 2 million barrels a day.''
   The kingdom is using the best industrialized techniques in its
production, he said, ``and will increase that output at close
intervals in the near future without affecting its oil fields.''
   The statement was an apparent denial of reports that Saudi
Arabia might not be able to maintain its output of 7.5 million
barrels per day because of technical difficulties.

<HEAD>Ford Next for Auto Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Workers at General Motors overwhelmingly ratified
a new three-year contract, the United Auto Workers union announced
Monday. Union and company officials said the next round of talks
would shift to Ford.
   UAW President Owen Bieber plans to resume negotiations Tuesday
with Ford Motor Co. which had been placed on hold for over a month
during the General Motors Corp. talks.
   ``We want to get on with this thing,'' Ford spokesman Dick Routh
said Monday.
   Negotiations between the union and Ford had been stalled since
Aug. 28, when the UAW chose to focus its attention on GM. The new
GM-UAW pact was approved by 86,032 votes in favor to 21,461
opposed, the union said in a statement Monday. Less than 36 percent
of the approximately 300,000 eligible UAW members cast ballots
during elections last week and Sunday.
   About 100,000 active Ford employees are covered under the
existing contract that technically expired at midnight Sept. 14.
   Contract provisions at all three auto makers were extended while
bargaining continued. In all, more that 450,000 active auto workers
are covered by the three contracts.
   ``This agreement will serve as an excellent pattern for new
contracts at Ford and Chrysler,'' Bieber and Vice President Stephen
Yokich, in charge of the union's GM Department, said in a joint
statement.
   There are a few provisions of the GM-UAW agreement that will be
troublesome to Ford, including new premiums on overtime work. But
it's expected that an agreement nearly parallel to the GM deal will
be signed by Ford.
   The GM agreement contains three years of income guarantees for
workers laid off because of slumping car and truck sales. GM has
said it would spend up to $4.1 billion on income-guarantee programs
in the new contact, compared with about $1.3 billion in the 1987
agreement.
   Various estimates put the cost of similar guarantees for Ford
workers at about $1.4 billion.
   The GM-UAW agreement also calls for a 3 percent increase in the
base wage in the first year and lump-sum payments equal to 3
percent in the second and third years. Cost of living adjustments
on wages were continued from the previous contract negotiated in
1987.
   Barring unforeseen complications, it's expected that negotiators
will be able to present a tentative agreement to Ford workers
within two weeks.
   The story may be different when intensive bargaining resumes
with Chrysler after a Ford agreement is reached. Chrysler officials
have called UAW-GM agreement very expensive.
   Chrysler, by far, is in the worst financial shape of the Big
Three. Later this month, it's expected to report a substantial loss
of $200 million or more for the third quarter.

   Around Washington, legislators, lobbyists and
public interest groups looked Monday at the plan to cut government
spending with the foreboding of a motorist receiving his mechanic's
estimate.
   They knew it would be costly but not exactly how costly.
   The $500 billion dent the government plans to make in its red
ink the next five years will trickle up from many streams small and
large: From a nickel from each gallon of gasoline, at first, to an
added $5.70 a month for Medicare, from $134 billion in new taxes
and fees to a $182 billion cutback in defense and domestic
programs.
   It starts with $40 billion in cutbacks the first year.
   The broad targets are there, but the details will have to be
worked out.
   Here's a quick look at some of the prospects.
   - Medicare:
   The federal health care program for 33 million elderly and
disabled Americans would take the largest hit of any of the
entitlement programs, with a hoped-for reduction of $60 billion.
   About half would come from recipients, whose $28.60 monthly
premium for doctors' care would increase to $34.30 next year, and
whose $75 deductible on doctors' bills would double by 1995.
   The other half would come from cutting back on reimbursements to
hospitals and physicians.
   The 1.45 percent tax that helps support the Medicare program
would rise from the first $51,300 of income to the first $73,000.
   Groups representing the elderly cried foul. Arthur Flemming,
head of the Save Our Social Security coalition, said it was
indefensible that the summiteers put half the revenue burden on
Medicare.
   ``President Bush and the budget summiteers are asking one eighth
of the population to shoulder one-half of the cuts in domestic
spending, and that eighth represents the oldest, the sickest, the
poorest adults - those least able to pay,'' said Ron Pollack,
director of Families USA.
   - Agriculture:
   House and Senate agriculture committee leaders spent Monday
conferring with staff over how to cut $13 billion from agriculture
programs without seriously damaging farmers' income.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was said to insist on
across-the-board cuts so no single commodity gets hurt worse than
others.
   Crops protected by government price supports are wheat, rice,
cotton and feed grains. If market prices fall below the target
price set by Congress, the government makes up the difference with
a direct payment to the farmer.
   The 1990 farm bill being worked out in a House-Senate conference
committee calls for $54 billion in spending on such subsidies over
the next five years.
   However, under the budget agreement that figure must be cut 25
percent.
   ``We don't want to see target prices dropped, but we'd rather
see target prices go down than loan rates go up,'' said Don Lipton,
director of media relations for the American Farm Bureau
Federation.
   Loan rates are a method of helping farmers who sell abroad, a
big moneymaking enterprise for American farmers.
   Leland Swenson, president of National Farmers Union, said the
$13 billion slash in USDA programs would ``throw the farm sector
into a tailspin.''
   - Post Office:
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank says the price of stamps will
go up more and sooner than had been planned because the budget
agreement calls on the Postal Service to absorb some $5 billion
over the next five years.
   ``Postage rates will be as much as 5 cents higher by 1995 than
they otherwise would have been,'' Frank said. There already is an
increase scheduled for next February, expected to raise the price
of a first class stamp to 30 cents.
   ``This is a conscious decision to shift obligations from the
Treasury to the Postal Service and has been characterized by many
as a `stamp tax.' Clearly it is,'' said Frank.
   - Energy:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary, said he did not think the
cutbacks would affect the department's massive cleanup efforts at
atomic weapons plants.
   - Taxes:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The gasoline tax, now 9 cents per gallon, up 5 cents Dec. 1,
another 2 cents Jan. 1 and 5 cents more next July 1 for a new total
of 21 cents per gallon. The cigarette tax, now 16 cents per pack,
up 4 cents in 1991 and another 4 cents in 1993, for a new total of
24 cents per pack.
   Beer and wine: The 16-cent tax on six-packs doubles; the $12.50
per gallon tax for 100 proof (50 percent) alcohol goes up to $14,
with lower-proof liquor going up by the same ratio; and the 3-cent
tax on a fifth of wine goes up to 25 cents, all in January.
   Cars worth more than $30,000, private boats exceeding $100,000,
furs and jewelry exceeding $5,000 face a 10 percent on their value
exceeding those levels. The tax applies to newly manufactured
items.
   Individuals or couples earning more than $100,000 could lose 3
percent of their deductions for their income over that amount.
   The largest increase in federal fees will be an increase in the
amount the government charges banks to insure deposits, a boost
that will garner $4 billion.
   - Defense:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Cut $68 billion below the amount needed to stay even with
inflation for the first three years, as much as $182 billion over
five years.
   - Education:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The budget agreement calls for trimming $2 billion from the
guaranteed student loan program. Negotiators suggested that
officials eliminate from the federal loan program all schools with
default rates above 30 percent. Officials acknowledge that many
trade and vocational schools, as well as historically black
colleges, will be eliminated.
   - Other benefit programs cuts:

   Save $8 billion by no longer letting civil service retirees take
their benefits in a lump sum, after a one-month grace period; $4.6

the government buys pharmaceuticals.

<HEAD>Gold, Energy, Grains Slide As War Fears Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold, grains and energy futures prices declined
sharply Monday as conciliatory gestures from the United States and
Iraq's Saddam Hussein produced a domino-effect easing of war
jitters.
   On other commodity markets, silver and platinum continued their
slide; meat futures prices were sharply higher; and soybeans were
lower.
   Gold settled $19.30 to $15.90 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in October at $386.60 a
troy ounce.
   Gold extended its losses from Friday's poor close. It followed
energy futures and continued its fall after saber-rattling speeches
and comments from Iraq and the United States softened Monday,
analysts said.
   ``There was no fresh (bad) news,'' said John Sak, a metals
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``Nothing in
the market propelled gold upwards, then you had the oil markets
crack - that's all you needed.''
   Energy futures led off the markets' decline, opening lower amid
a perceived decline in chances of impending war. Prices fell
further after President Bush made a moderate speech to the United
Nations.
   Light sweet crude oil settled $2.42 to its $1 limit lower with
November at $37.09 a barrel; heating oil was 5.89 cents lower to
unchanged with November at $1.0003 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
4.8 cents to 2.5 cents lower with November at 93.9 cents a gallon.
   Platinum settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange $7.30 to
$6.30 lower with October at $426.80 a troy ounce. Silver settled
15.5 cents to 12.1 cents lower on the Commodity Exchange with
October at $4.64 an ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were sharply down on the
Chicago Board of Trade, as a result of increased harvest pressures
and declines on the precious metal and energy markets.
   Wheat futures prices fell to levels from two weeks ago amid
doubts the Soviet Union does not plan to buy subsidized wheat flour
from the government. Analysts also attributed the losses to
professional selling by major companies and near-ideal harvest
conditions.
   ``There's a very weak export outlook to buy grains,'' said
Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
in New York. ``You're moving grains into positions to be sold and
you don't have any ready buyers, so that's going to push prices
lower.''
   Soybean futures pushed toward double-digit losses as major
corporations sold off their interest. Near-ideal weather conditions
in areas where the crop is grown also added pessimism the entire
harvest would be sold, Spilka said.
   Corn followed soybeans and wheat amid the same fears.
   Wheat futures settled 10 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.67} a bushel; corn was 5
cents to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.23 a bushel; oats were
1} cents to } cent lower with December at $1.19\ a bushel; soybeans
were 13 cents to 9{ cents lowe with November at $6.04{ a bushel.
   Meat futures were sharply higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Hogs and frozen pork bellies futures prices closed at their
trading limits after speculators reacted favorably to Friday's
release of the Agriculture Department's quarterly hogs and pigs
report, which showed a slower-than-expected growth in the breeding
herd and a decline in market hogs.
   Cattle rose on spillover support from hogs and pork bellies and
higher cash prices.
   Live cattle settled .48 cent to 1.12 cents higher with October
at 80.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .85 cent to 1.37 cents
higher with October at 88.12 cents a pound; hogs settled at its
trading limit 1.5 cents higher with October at 56.32 cents a pound;
pork bellies closed at its trading limit 2 cents higher with
February at 60.20 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary
have filed notices of claims against the U.S. Coast Guard totalling
more than $2 billion in connection with the Exxon Valdez shipwreck.
   Exxon spokesman Les Rogers said the Sept. 21 filings satisfy an
administrative requirement that preserves options for Exxon and
Exxon Shipping Co. to sue the Coast Guard over the spill.
   Exxon has said it has spent more than $2 billion for both its
cleanup efforts and payments to fishermen and related businesses
for losses related to the spill.
   ``The claimants allege the Coast Guard is wholly or partially
liable for costs Exxon incurred in cleaning up the spill and for
amounts paid to parties in settlement of claims, as well as for
future costs expected to be incurred by Exxon as a result of
pending litigation,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. John McElwain.
   Exxon declined to offer an explanation for why company officials
think the Coast Guard should share responsibility for the March 24,
1989, oil spill that dumped nearly 11 million gallons of crude into
Prince William Sound.
   But in the past Exxon has claimed that the cleanup was hindered
by cleanup authorities' refusal to give it blanket permission to
use dispersants in the first three days after the spill. The Coast
Guard was involved in the decision. Exxon has said broader use of
the chemical would have kept more oil off the shores of the Sound.
   ``We're trying to evaluate the claims (against the Coast Guard)
to see if they have any basis in admiralty law,'' McElwain said.
   Some 200 civil lawsuits involving thousands of plaintiffs have
been filed against Exxon, mostly in state court in Alaska.
   Plaintiffs include the state, residents of villages in the
spill's path, fishermen, fish processors, tourism companies,
fishing lodges and some of the nation's largest environmental
organizations.
   Court dates have not been scheduled.

   The volatile price of oil took its
second-sharpest fall of the Persian Gulf crisis, tumbling more than
$2 per barrel Monday as traders thought they saw glimmers of peace.
   Light sweet crude for November delivery dropped $2.42 to $37.09
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil's largest one-day
fall since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 was $4 per barrel on Aug.
27.
   Crude was down as much as $3.66 per barrel in light trading
Monday afternoon, but regained part of that ground late in the day
as some speculators bought futures to avoid being short on oil
overnight.
   Later contract months for crude delivery fell by the exchange's
limit of $1 per barrel.
   Oil opened lower on a weekend statement from Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that was viewed by traders as being more
conciliatory than usual. Oil then fell sharply around midday, when
President Bush told the U.N. General Assembly he hoped there could
be a diplomatic solution to the Mideast turmoil.
   ``The market was looking for some saber-rattling,'' said Brian
Tagler, a broker at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``We know Bush
wants the U.N. to approve taking military action. We thought there
might be mention of that. There was none. It was a very peaceful
speech.''
   Refined petroleum products also fell Monday.
   Home heating oil dropped 5.89 cents to $1.0003 per gallon on
November delivery contracts, with later months also falling.
Unleaded gasoline fell 4.80 cents to 93.91 cents per gallon for
November, with other months down as well.
   Natural gas fell 2.6 cents to $1.909 per 1,000 cubic feet for
November. Later contracts months also went down.
   As oil fell, stock prices increased. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials jumped 63.36 points to 2,515.84, its largest point gain
since rising 78.71 points on Aug. 27.
   Traders said oil's fall on Monday was evidence of shifting
psychology in the chaotic markets.
   ``Most important is a slight ease in tensions now,'' said Thomas
Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in
Hoboken, N.J. ``It might be premature, but it's some type of hope
that we haven't been seeing.''
   Brokers said oil prices seemed to be testing the $36 range as a
potential base for future trading, after hitting the $40 level late
last week in what is viewed as the potential ceiling for prices, at
least in the short term.
   ``The market is just trying to find a range,'' said trader Ed
Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

<HEAD>Gold Falls $16 an Ounce; Dollar Lower in U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices fell nearly $16 an ounce Monday,
following the price of oil lower on a belief of better prospects
for a negotiated settlement to the Middle East crisis.
   An agreement on a U.S. deficit-reduction package sent the dollar
lower against major foreign currencies. Traders said the package
heralded a move to lower interest rates soon by the Federal
Reserve.
   Lower U.S. interest rates would make dollar-denominated
investments less attractive to foreigners seeking high yields.
   The decline in gold prices in New York followed sharp drops in
Asia and Europe, which reacted to weekened reports that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein might be willing to negotiate with Kuwait
over his occupation of the Persian Gulf nation.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for October
delivery settled at $386.60 a troy ounce, down $15.90 from Friday's
close. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late gold bid of
$387.90, down $15.10 an ounce from Friday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $395.25 per ounce,
from $404.75 bid per ounce late Friday. In Zurich, the bid price
was $396.60, down from $406.25 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold fell
$5.67 to close at a bid $398.07.
   Gold futures prices have mirrored the rise and fall of oil
futures since Iraq's takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The pattern held
Monday, as light sweet crude dropped $2.42 to $37.09 a barrel for
November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Higher oil prices increase inflation, which tends to push
investors to gold, which is seen as stable in times of economic
turmoil. The U.S. budget accord also helped to push down gold,
traders said.
   ``With oil prices down, the pyschology is to get out of gold,''
said Jim Koppel, managing director of Deak International Trading
(U.S.) Ltd.
   The idea of a negotiated settlement in the Middle East gained
strength Monday when President Bush told the U.N. General Assembly
he wanted a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the crisis.
   In the currency market, the dollar ended lower in New York after
sharp declines overseas with selling linked to the U.S. budget
accord providing for large tax increases and spending cuts.
   ``People went out and sold the dollar because they're looking
for the Fed to cut the discount rate,'' said Arnold Sherrer, chief
foreign exchange trader for the Royal Bank of Canada.
   Traders said, though, that the decline stalled in New York with
some selling to take profits after the drops on foreign markets.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.80 yen to a closing 137.15 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted lower at 137.00 yen. In New York,
the dollar traded at 136.75 yen, down from 138.50 late Friday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8890, more
expensive than $1.8735 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.8830 to
buy one pound, up from $1.8760 late Friday.
   Other dollar rates late in New York, compared with Friday's late
quotes included: 1.55735 German marks, down from 1.5670; 1.2960
Swiss francs, down from 1.29735; 5.2195 French francs, down from
5.2455; 1,167.25 Italian lire, down from 1,173.25; and 1.153825
Canadian dollars, down from 1.15425.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates included: 1.5520 German marks, down from 1.5655; 1.2885 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2980; 5.1985 French francs, down from 5.2420;
1.7495 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7655; 1,163.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,172.25, and 1.1526 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1563.
   Silver prices declined more than 12 cents an ounce in New York.
   On the Comex, silver bullion for October delivery settled at
$4.64 a troy ounce compared to the Friday settlement price of
$4.761. Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.725 a troy
ounce, from Friday's $4.79.

<HEAD>Regan Says Reagan's Policies Delayed S&amp;Ls' Worst Troubles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said
Monday the savings and loan industry would have plunged ``into the
tank'' deeper and faster without the deregulatory policies of the
Reagan administration.
   ``Absolutely not,'' Regan replied when asked by Rep. Chalmers
Wylie, R-Ohio, if the thrift debacle discredited deregulation.
Regan appeared before the House Banking Committee in the first of a
series of hearings examining the causes of the S&amp;L mess.
   ``When you see the Eastern European countries ... coming over
here to find out how did we do it, you have to say our policies
were correct and deregulation was one of them,'' said Regan, who
served as Treasury secretary from 1981 to 1985, when he became
White House chief of staff.
   Regan said that after interest rates soared in the 1980s, a
result he said of the economic policies of the Carter
administration, it became clear that a financial business confined
to taking deposits from savers and lending the money to home buyers
could not survive.
   He said he had favored giving thrifts the same investment powers
as commercial banks, but had opposed the broader deregulation in
some states that had given thrifts non-bank powers.
   If not for the administration-backed banking deregulation bill
of 1982, ``I think the thrift industry would have gone into the
tank sooner and may have never emerged,'' he said.
   Regan, who was chairman of Merrill Lynch before becoming
treasury secretary, was described as ``the father of brokered
deposits'' by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Such high-interest deposits, placed by Wall Street brokerage
houses, usually in amounts just under the $100,000 deposit
insurance limit, are blamed for fueling the explosive growth in
risky investments at many S&amp;Ls.
   Regan, however, said he had recused himself from any policy
matters affecting brokered deposits because of his connection to
Merrill Lynch and said the firm did not deal in them extensively
until after he left.
   ``I want a blood test as far as being the father of brokered
deposits. I am not - in no way, shape or fashion,'' he said.
   Kennedy countered that Regan allowed his subordinate, Deputy
Treasury Secretary R.T. McNamar, to forcefully advocate their use.
   Regan blamed the explosion of brokered deposits on Congress'
1980 decision to raise the deposit insurance limit from $40,000 per
account to $100,000. As a reform, he advocated forcing depositors
to pay for their own deposit insurance on amounts over $100,000.
   Edwin Gray, the nation's top thrift regulator from 1983 to 1987,
has accused Regan of trying to force him from office when he tried
to rein in the industry in general and brokered deposits in
particular.
   Regan, who previously had not had a chance to reply to Gray in a
public forum, described him as an absentee, lax regulator.
   ``In 1985, when I became chief of staff, I began to hear rumors
that this man was not paying attention; he was part of the problem,
not the solution. ... He was sort of a front for the industry. I
didn't like that,'' Regan said.
   He sid that between September 1983 and June 1986, Gray was in
his office only 397 weekdays and absent 466 days. He also noted
that Gray was forced to repay his agency, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, $26,000 for travel and entertainment.
   ``He want to Pebble Beach. He went to Greenbriar. My crack was,
`I think he's working more on his handicap than he's working on the
thrifts,''' Regan said, adding later, ``This guy gets religion when
he's found out.''
   Gray and former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker are
scheduled to appear before the committee Wednesday. The committee
chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, plans to hear from
Carter administration officials later. Richard T. Pratt, Gray's
predecessor at the bank board from 1981 to 1983, testified after
Regan.
   Pratt said he was rejected by Congress and the Reagan
administration in his attempts to get money to pay for more S&amp;L
examiners. Regan, he said, would not take his calls.
   Pratt also defended his decision early in the S&amp;L crisis to
permit thrifts to use accounting techniques to hide their losses.
Otherwise, it would have cost $178 billion - $350 billion in 1990
dollars - to liquidate insolvent thrifts, he said.
   Pratt said when he took office nearly every S&amp;L in the nation
was technically insolvent because soaring interest rates had
drastically cut the value of their low-interest, fixed-rate
mortgages. Regulators' strategy was to close the worst institutions
and to buy time for the others until interest rates fell, as they
did, he said.

<HEAD>Emerson President Resigns, Other Changes Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH BERGEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation last week of the
president of Emerson Radio Corp., was unconnected with the
simultaneous announcement of two international joint ventures, the
new chairman said Monday.
   Stephen Lane, resigned on Friday amid questions over whether he
was competent to manage his firm's affairs because he was
recuperating from surgery for two brain tumors.
   The resignation coincided with the announcement of two major
international joint ventures, one with a Japanese firm and a second
with a Swiss concern, said William Lane, the new president and
chief executive, who assumed those positions from his brother.
   In resigning, Lane said he also feared that adverse publicity
from a lawsuit he filed against investment bankers Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. could harm Emerson, where he worked for the past 30
years.
   The suit charged that Lane lost millions of dollars during the
1987 stock market crash because Drexel's broker - Lane's wife, Tina
- was unqualified.
   He will continue as a consultant to the firm, which produces
consumer electronic products, Lane said.
   Tomei Industrial Holdings Ltd., based in Hong Kong, has
purchased 2 million shares of Emerson's common stock at $3.75 a
share, or nearly $7.5 million, for 5 percent of the company, the
company announced Friday. Emerson stock closed at $2.875 that day,
up $0.25. The agreement includes a seat on the eight-member board
of directors.
   Tomei will have to purchase another 2 million shares at $4 per
share within a year in order to retain its board seat, William Lane
said.
   Emerson also plans to enter a joint venture with Zurich,
Switzerland-based Fidenas Investment Ltd., Emerson's largest
shareholder at 12 percent, William Lane said.
   ``Fidenas will run Emerson operations in Europe, where it has
contacts and expertise,'' William Lane said.
   Fidenas will seat two directors on the board, William Lane said.
   The Fidenas agreement must still be formally presented to
Emerson stockholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Chrysler Corp. said Monday that
prices for its 1991 cars and trucks would rise an average of less
than 1 percent over comparably equipped 1990 models.
   Earlier, Ford Motor Co. announced its 1991 prices would increase
an average of 3.2 percent and General Motors Corp. said its 1991
models would cost an average of 2.3 percent more than 1990
versions.
   Prices for Chrysler's two best-selling and most profitable lines
of vehicles - minivans and Jeeps - will go up 2 percent and 3.2
percent respectively.
   The company said the price changes vary from a $1,270 increase
in the cost of a Chrysler Imperial to a $1,300 reduction in the
base price of a Dodge Monaco.

<HEAD>Comfed Savings Files Suit Against 34 Former Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts thrift filed suit Monday
against 34 former employees, claiming that widespread misconduct
exacerbated the financial troubles of the struggling Comfed Savings
Bank.
   Among the defendants named in the suit were Raymond F. Miller
Jr., who was ousted as bank president; and James G. Baldini, former
president of Comfed Mortgage Co. Inc.
   The suit filed in Middlesex Superior Court marks the latest
development in Comfed's battle for survival. Company Chairman Jack
Zoeller said Comfed, like most banks in New England, ``has
sustained substantial losses as a result of the downturn in the
region's real estate market.''
   ``However, we firmly believe that our loan losses were increased
materially due to the misconduct of the individuals as alleged in
this suit,'' Zoeller said in a statement.
   The charges contained in the suit include intentional
misconduct, mismanagement and fraud in the processing and approval
of residential and commercial loans.
   Comfed said it will seek to recover the amount of losses
determined by the courts.
   Miller was unavailable for comment Monday. Baldini said he could
not respond to specific allegations since he had not seen the
complaint.
   But he added, ``I have done nothing wrong.''

   The stock market recouped some of its summer
losses with a sharp rally Monday, encouraged by falling oil prices
and hopes for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 63.36 points to
2,515.84, for its largest point gain since it rose 78.71 points on
Aug. 27.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,203 up, 442 down and 365 unchanged.
   A monthly report on the economy from the National Association of
Purchasing Management, coupled with the long-awaited federal budget
accord announced over the weekend, raised hopes that the Federal
Reserve might adopt an easier credit policy.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has said the approval of a
deficit cutting agreement would give the nation's central bank more
leeway in allowing rates to drop.
   The purchasing managers report, meanwhile, provided further
evidence of a weakening manufacturing economy. The purchasing
managers monthly index fell sharply in September for its third
consecutive drop.
   The market expected the report to put further pressure on the
Fed to lower rates as a means of stimulating the economy.
   Stocks also got some help from a drop in oil prices. Crude oil
for November delivery fell $2.42 a barrel to $37.09 a barrel in New
York Mercantile Exchange trading.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris,
up 2{ at 47}; General Electric, up 1} at 56\; Boeing, up 2| at 44\;
International Business Machines, up 2| at 109, and American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1&rsqb; at 32\.
   Energy stocks were mostly lower. Atlantic Richfield dropped 2&rsqb;
to 132; Amoco 1 to 55}; Texaco ~ to 60&rsqb;, and Halliburton 1~ to 49{.
But Exxon rose | to 49|.
   Airline issues climbed on hopes for relief from soaring fuel
costs. AMR gained 2} to 45; UAL 6&lsqb; to 103&rsqb;, and Delta Air Lines 2&lsqb;
to 57&lsqb;.
   Precious-metals stocks weakened as the price of gold fell. ASA
Ltd. dropped 1~ to 47{; Battle Mountain Gold 1 to 9{; Newmont Gold
3~ to 41{, and Homestake Mining 1| to 20.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 202.21 million
shares, against 201.01 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 235.96 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $75.41 billion, or
2.62 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 4.37 to 172.22.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 10.07 to 370.54, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 8.89 at 314.94.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees To Hear Age Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether workers who accuse employers of violating a federal law
against age discrimination sometimes may be forced to submit their
case to arbitration.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by a North Carolina
man fired at age 62 by a securities firm.
   Robert Gilmer was fired in 1987 as manager of financial services
for Interstate-Johnson Lane Corp. and was replaced by a 28-year-old
who Gilmer said was less qualified.
   Six years earlier when he was hired, Gilmer signed a
registration form as a securities representative with the New York
Stock Exchange in which he agreed to submit any dispute between
himself and his employer to arbitration.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in February that the
arbitration agreement is binding.
   Gilmer said the agreement violates the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act.
   But the 4th Circuit court said nothing in the law forbids
arbitration. ``Congress clearly did not intend that all ADEA
disputes be resolved in federal court,'' the appeals court said. It
also noted that the Supreme Court in recent rulings has endorsed
arbitration as an alternative to lawsuits in some cases.
   The case is Gilmer vs. Interstate-Johnson Lane, 90-18.

<TEXT>
   Copyright ownership of telephone directories
will be explored in a Kansas case granted Supreme Court review
Monday.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by a company that
distributed an edited version of a Kansas telephone directory.
   The company, Feist Publications Inc., unsuccessfully tried to
buy the white pages from Rural Telephone Service Company, which has
customers in the northwest part of the state. The telephone company
has a monopoly for its area.
   Feist then edited the Rural directory, relisting the names by
towns in a 15-county region that included the area served by Rural.
Feist has distributed its directory since 1978.
   A federal judge ruled that Feist violated copyright law and
awarded Rural $6,000 and attorneys fees.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the damage award
last March.
   The appeals court rejected Feist's arguments that Rural violated
antitrust law by monopolizing the listing of its customers.
   Feist's appeal to the high court is supported by the Association
of North American Directory Publishers and the Directory Publishers
Association representing more than 100 publishers of telephone
directories.
   The case is Feist Publications vs. Rural Telephone, 89-1909.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Bracing for Gas-Tax Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's Big Three automakers said
Monday a deficit-reduction proposal that includes a hefty
gasoline-tax increase is difficult, but good for the country.
   ``The nation needs a meaningful budget-reduction package,'' said
Susan Shackson, Ford Motor Co.'s director of public policy
development. ``Is this the best one? Probably not. But we are where
we are. I would say at this point, let's get on with it.''
   Congressional and administration negotiators reached an
agreement Sunday which would, if enacted, boost the federal
gasoline tax by next July to 21 cents a gallon from the current 9
cents.
   It also would impose a 10 percent tax on new cars that cost more
than $30,000.
   On the positive side, Shackson and Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca said the proposal was likely to be accompanied by
interest-rate reductions.
   ``This budget package gives (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan
Greenspan the tools to make sure we get them,'' Iacocca said in a
statement.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman Bill Noack said company officials
were reviewing the proposal. In the past, GM has opposed any gas
tax increase earmarked for deficit reduction.
   ``We have said we thought a gasoline tax used in that way would
be a regressive tax and would be disproportionately burdensome on
low-income families,'' he said. ``And there are Americans who drive
long distances, and for those people it would be difficult.''
   The three-step boost in the gas tax - 5 cents on Dec. 1, 2 cents
Jan. 1 and another nickel on July 1, 1991 - couldn't have come at a
worst time for the auto industry.
   Oil prices have been creeping up ever since Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2. Today, gasoline prices are about 30 percent higher than
before the invasion.
   So far, automakers have insisted that consumers aren't turning
toward smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and away from large,
gas-gulping cars and trucks.
   But evidence of a change may show up Wednesday when the
companies report September car and light truck sales figures. It's
expected the downward trend sales have shown since the first of the
year will continue.
   The degree of decline may indicate if consumers are beginning to
take a wait-and-see approach to purchasing a new car or truck.
   Through Sept. 20 of this year, the Big Three have sold 7,196,364
North American-made cars and trucks, 8 percent lower than sales
during the same time last year.

   Electric Boat gave layoff notices Monday to
582 employees at its Groton and Quonset Point, R.I., plants, citing
declining military orders and uncertainty about federal defense
expenditures.
   The layoffs, mainly of support personnel, represent less than 3
percent of the total work force of Electric Boat, a division of
General Dynamics Corp. But company officials said as many as 5
percent could receive layoff notices by November.
   ``How many people we're going to lay off in the end will depend
on the defense budget. It could be up to 1,000, but it won't be
more than the 4 percent to 5 percent we've announced,'' said Neil
Ruenzel, a spokesman for the submarine builder.
   Of the employees laid off Monday, 415 are salaried staff and 167
are hourly, Ruenzel said.
   Most of the layoffs occurred in Groton, where 17,000 are
employed. About 110 of those getting notices work at the Rhode
Island plant, which employs about 5,000.
   A few workers are also being laid off at EB satellite locations
in such places as Avenel, N.J., and Charleston, S.C., Ruenzel said.
   ``This will affect primarily overhead and support personnel -
people in areas like financial management, purchasing and materials
control - and few of the men and women actually involved in
building the submarines,'' Ruenzel said. ``We may have fewer orders
now, but we still have to build the ships.''
   Employees in all departments of the Groton plant milled around
nervously Monday during breaks, many of them reading and re-reading
an announcement distributed all over the plant that morning in the
company's employee bulletin.
   The company said employees were being notified on a one-on-one
basis by their supervisors.
   Employees laid off Monday will lose their jobs 60 days later,
Ruenzel said. In the meantime, the company's new Career Transition
Center will help laid-off employees think through their options,
manage their stress and work on brushing up resume and interview
skills.
   But to many of those who woke up Monday uncertain whether they
would come home at the end of their shifts with or without their
jobs, the center is little comfort.
   ``It's like propaganda. First they take away your job, then they
say they want to help,'' said one employee of the nuclear
department who asked that his name not be used. ``It doesn't help
much to work on your job skills when the only job you're likely to
get has just been taken away from you.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Surge as Oil Prices Fall, Budget Accord Reached</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury bond prices surged Monday as the market
cheered a sharp drop in oil prices and the federal budget accord
reached by Congress and President Bush over the weekend.
   ``The bond market was kind of deluged with good news today,''
said Susan Hering, a Treasury bond economist at Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1-32 point, or
$10.32 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when
the price rises, dropped to 8.84 percent from 8.94 percent late
Friday. It was the lowest yield for the ``long bond'' in about six
weeks.
   Bond prices usually rise on signs that inflation may be easing.
One such signal is a drop in oil prices, which bonds have tracked
closely since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The November contract for oil dropped $2.42 a barrel to $37.09
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the second-largest price drop
since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Oil prices were influenced by a weekend statement from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein that appeared to ease tensions in the
Middle East, and by comments from Bush, who told the U.N. General
Assembly on Monday that he hoped there could be a diplomatic
solution to the Mideast turmoil.
   Meanwhile, the bond market was encouraged by the accord on the
fiscal 1991 federal budget. The market has looked to the Federal
Reserve to ease interest rates after the budget was resolved. Lower
rates benefit fixed-rate securities such as bonds.
   William V. Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., attributed the sharp run-up in bond prices to
``one-third budget, two-thirds oil.''
   ``It wasn't until the sharp plunge in oil (following Bush's
United Nations address) that the bond market re-energized itself,''
he said.
   Bond prices also were supported by another signal of growing
weakness in the economy. The nation's corporate purchasing managers
announced that their widely watched monthly index of industrial
activity dropped for the third straight month to its lowest level
in nearly eight years.
   Signs of economic sluggishness often are viewed favorably by
bond investors because they may cause the Fed to ease interest
rates.
   But Ms. Hering wasn't optimistic that bond prices would retain
their new-found strength. She said the market remains tied to Iraq
and its effect on oil prices.
   Also Monday, the Treasury sold at auction $9.2 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.18 percent, and
$9.2 billion in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.21
percent.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.17
percent on Sept. 19, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 7.19
percent on Aug. 6, 1990.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term
issues gained 3-32 point to 3-16 point, intermediate maturities
rose 11-32 point to 13-16 point, and long-term issues jumped 29-32
point to 1 1-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, advanced 3.61 to 1,150.16.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.34
percent as the discount remained at 7.12 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell marginally to at 7.504 percent as the discount
remained at 7.15 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.61
percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 7.11 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another
for overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, up from 8 percent
late Friday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose &rsqb; point to 88 19-32. The average yield
to maturity fell to 7.78 percent from 7.79 percent late Friday.

<HEAD>Possible Takeover Bid for Toymaker Tonka Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malcolm I. Glazer, a businessman who last year
bought a sizeable chunk of Harley-Davidson Inc., announced Monday
he holds an 8.6 percent stake in Tonka Corp. and may seek control
of the Minnesota-based toymaker.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Glazer,
who maintains offices in Rochester, N.Y. and Boynton Beach, Fla.,
said he and his six children have acquired approximately 1.25
million Tonka common stock shares for a total of $4.4 million.
   The Glazer group said in the filing that it had ``no definitive
plans at this time'' but ``may seek to acquire a controlling
interest'' in Minnetonka, Minn.-based Tonka or to obtain seats on
the board of directors.
   Joe Joyce, general counsel for Tonka, said the company is aware
of the SEC filing but will not comment on it. He declined to answer
whether Glazer has contacted the company or whether Tonka officials
view it as a serious takeover threat.
   In the SEC filing, Glazer described himself as a self-employed,
private investor with holdings in the communications, real estate,
health care and banking industries.
   Last fall he purchased a large chunk of Harley-Davidson, the
Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer. After acquiring a 7.26
percent stake, he urged the motorcycle maker to sell off its
recreational vehicle subsidiary. Harley-Davidson refused and Glazer
later reduced his stake.
   The Glazer group said it bought Tonka stock at prices ranging
from $4.55 to $5.50 per share between Aug. 7 and last Thursday. All
of the Tonka shares were purchased in open-market transactions on
the New York Stock Exchange, according to Glazer's SEC documents.
   Tonka stock closed down 25 cents Monday, at $4.37{ a share.

<HEAD>Ralph Nader Says He May Sue Forbes If It Doesn't Retract Article</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Nader said Monday he would consider suing
Forbes magazine if it doesn't respond within a week to his request
to retract a highly critical cover story on the consumer activist.
   Nader, in an interview, called the story in the Sept. 17 issue
of the biweekly business magazine ``on the low order of
journalism.''
   ``They didn't do their homework,'' he said, claiming the article
contains ``deep-rooted error.''
   ``Almost every derogatory statement is wrapped around a false
statement,'' he continued.
   ``They're used to going after people who have skeletons in their
closet,'' he said. ``They picked on the wrong crowd this time. By
the time we get through with Forbes magazine there will be a case
study for journalism schools.''
   Nader said he would consider filing a suit seeking a retraction
if the magazine doesn't voluntarily print one.
   The story claims that although Nader portrays himself as an
independent activist free of outside influence, he in fact
represents the interests of trial lawyers who sue companies in
product-liability cases and take other legal actions against
companies.
   In turn, these lawyers contribute financially to Nader's
organizations, Forbes claims.
   The article also claims that one of Nader's groups, the Center
for Study of Responsive Law, founded in 1968, has never made
required tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service.
   In addition, Forbes wrote that though Nader says he lives a
Spartan life in ``a simple room'' near his Washington, D.C.,
office, he actually lives in an expensive townhouse that is owned
by his sister.
   Forbes Editor James Michaels said the magazine stands by its
story.
   ``At this point, and we're making a very careful check, we don't
see that there's anything to retract,'' he said.
   He said the magazine also hasn't decided whether it would print
a letter from Nader rebutting the article. ``It's a very abusive
letter,'' Michaels said.

   A sigh of relief sounded on Wall Street Monday
after the Bush administration and leaders of Congress finally
compromised on a budget, but the best thing many observers could
say of the accord was that it exists.
   ``I think the financial markets are grateful that the issue is
going to be put behind us for a while,'' said David H. Resler,
chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
``Regardless of whether people like or dislike the compromise,
there is some feeling that an albatross has been removed from
around the market's neck.''
   A stalemate in the negotiations over a package of tax increases
and spending cuts had added to the worries weighing down the stock
market in recent weeks. Markets welcomed the break in the deadlock
as a sign that interest rates could be header lower.
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 63.36 points, closing
at 2,515.84, amid hopes that the budget accord will make the
Federal Reserve more likely to relax its monetary policy. In the
credit market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 1&lsqb; point,
or $11.25 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Assuming that Congress enacts most of what has been cobbled
together by White House and congressional negotiators, the most
crucial question about the new 1991 budget proposal can only be
answered over time: Will the higher taxes and spending reductions
hit the economy too hard?
   ``To the extent one can see through the smoke and mirrors, I
don't think it will harm the economy as it sinks into recession,''
said Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.'s chief economist Irwin
Kellner. ``In the short-term, it probably isn't enough fiscal
restraint to push the economy down any more than it's going on its
own.''
   Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu, said there
is a danger, however, that the 1991 budget ``could be viewed in
history as maybe the most ill-timed fiscal response ever.''
   With the economy entering or already in recession, this year
might be the wrong time to enact measures that further discourage
consumer spending.
   A report released Monday by the National Association of
Purchasing Management furnished fresh evidence of economic
problems. The group's index that tracks the manufacturing sector
sank in September to the lowest level since the cusp of the last
recession eight years ago.
   Imposing heavier taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline will
take money out of people's pockets, meaning there will be less
income available for discretionary purchases of other items, Fabbri
said.
   Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc.,
said he expects the Fed will ease policy slightly, soon nudging
down short-term interest rates by about \ percentage point. If the
economy continues to deteriorate, the central bank might have to
ease again later.
   The Fed might wait to act until after Congress completes the
ratification process and the budget is a done deal a few weeks from
now.
   No matter what the Fed does or when it does it, interest rates
probably will sink. Resler said rates will go down as credit demand
shrinks ``because the economy is crumbling beneath our feet.''
   The deficit-cutting blueprint isn't without merit, which even
cynical Wall Street insiders were willing to concede.
   Fabbri of Midland Montagu said the plan is based on fewer phoney
economic estimates and less accounting gimmickry than past budgets
because it includes some genuine tax hikes and spending cuts. The
administration also owned up to more realistic projections.
   For Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover, the White House and
Congress appear headed on a proper course.
   ``It is encouraging. For the moment, it seems to be one tiny
step in the right direction,'' he said. ``I'm sure glad that they
reached some semblance of an agreement instead of not reaching one
at all.''

   Toll-free numbers no longer will be
limited to business telephones with the availability of a new 800
residential service, US Sprint announced Monday.
   The service will offer an alternative to collect and
operator-assisted calling, said Steve Akin, president of Sprint's
Consumer Services Group.
   ``Parents of college students can stay in touch with their sons
and daughters on a regular basis and control costs,'' Akin said.
``Large, scattered families can talk economically with each
other.''
   He said the service is also aimed at independent business
people, such as real estate agents, sales representatives and
attorneys, who would offer the 800 number to out-of-town clients
and friends.
   Robin Pence, a US Sprint spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., said
the 800 service would save customers about 50 percent over collect,
credit card or operator-assisted calls.
   Customers also would save between 12 and 15 percent over
direct-dial calls, Pence said. Users will be billed a flat $10
monthly fee, plus normal long distance charges for calls received.
   US Sprint said it would waive the $50 installation fee for those
signing up in the next three months. Customers won't be required to
change their long-distance companies. The service uses existing
equipment and telephone lines.
   US Sprint is a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., a
diversified international telecommunications company based in
Kansas City.

<HEAD>3 Get Promotions at TBS; Say Ted Turner Still Runs The Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three veteran executives at Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. were promoted, but they said company Chairman Ted
Turner, while less of a day-to-day presence, remains at the
controls of the cable television empire.
   ``This doesn't change Ted's role at all. He's still extremely
pervasive. But there are some areas he doesn't need to be involved
in day to day,'' said Terence F. McGuirk, who was promoted from
president of Turner Sports to executive vice president of TBS.
   McGuirk, who has been with Turner since 1972, will retain his
position as head of the TBS sports division.
   Also promoted Monday was Scott Sassa, from executive vice
president of Turner Network Television to president of Turner
Entertainment Networks. Sassa first joined TBS in 1982.
   And Julia W. Sprunt was promoted from supervisor of the
company's advertising and promotions department to vice president
of marketing and communications. She joined Turner, in the
company's cable affiliate, in 1981.
   McGuirk told reporters in a conference call that he has worked
closely with Ted Turner for many years. McGuirk said there would be
no radical changes as a result of the management moves.
   The promotions follow a string of defections from the TBS upper
echelon over the past year, including senior executive Robert
Wussler and, last month, entertainment networks president Gerry
Hogan.
   McGuirk characterized the recent departures as part of the
natural evolution of the 4,500-employee company.
   ``We're a big and deep company,'' McGuirk said. ``The fact that
a few people have left ... I don't follow the story that there's
any pattern to that.''
   He also denied that the changes signal the end of an
entrepreneurial spirit at TBS in favor of a more conservative
approach to business.
   ``I don't think that our growth is coming to an end,'' McGuirk
said. ``I don't think the entrepreneurial spirit will ever go away.
Ted sets the tone for that.''
   Sassa said one of his main goals is to usher in the ``next stage
of maturity'' for the Turner's flagship cable SuperStation. He said
he wanted to inject some new life into the station's marketing and
promotions, rather than make any significant changes in its
content.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday ordered Eagle-Picher
Industries Inc. and lawyers for asbestos disease victims to begin
settlement talks on tens of thousands of claims that threaten the
company's future.
   Also, Eagle-Picher asked U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
to rule that the company has limited funds to meet its asbestos
liability, which would allow him to declare a mandatory
class-action lawsuit to resolve the claims.
   Eagle-Picher has said it has more than 64,000 asbestos claims
pending with another 20,000 being filed each year.
   Weinsten did not certify the proposed national class but
appointed two lawyers to serve as counsel for the proposed class
and ordered settlement talks to begin immediately.
   ``It is necessary and in the best interest of the proposed class
to expedite resolution of this matter to prevent further financial
deterioration of Eagle-Picher so as to secure prompt and equitable
payments to eligible present and future claimants,'' the judge
said.
   A former federal judge, Marvin E. Frankel, recently found that
Eagle-Picher likely faces insolvency unless it finds a way to
resolve asbestos personal injury claims. The Cincinnati-based
company makes industrial products that used asbestos widely for
years.
   Weinstein said efforts must be made to agree ``quickly and
consensually'' on the claims of the proposed class members against
Eagle-Picher.
   The judge has said he would pool the resources of Eagle-Picher,
the Manville settlement trust fund and up to four other companies
that cannot afford to fight cases in court or pay asbestos claims.
   Weinstein appointed New York attorney Kenneth R. Feinberg as a
special master to coordinate the settlement talks. Feinberg is to
present an oral report to Weinstein by Oct. 10.
   Weinstein also named Peter G. Angelos of Baltimore to serve as
counsel for the members of the proposed class with an existing
claim against Eagle-Picher. Angelos' firm currently represents
about 11,000 victims of asbestos-related diseases.
   David I. Shapiro, a Washington lawyer who served as a settlement
master in the Agent Orange litigation, will represent class members
who may file future claims against the company.
   Asbestos, a mineral used for decades for insulation and
construction, causes lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.
More than 90,000 lawsuits surrounding asbestos ailments are pending
in state and federal courts.
   Weinstein has taken the lead is resolving the asbestos
litigation. He is supervising the reorganization of the Manville
trust, the nation's biggest asbestos claims resolution facility,
which earlier this year ran out of money to pay new claims.

<HEAD>Unisys Unveils Strategy To Link Its Computers With Competitors'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. on Monday unveiled its strategy to
link its computers with those of competitors, saying it would
provide a method unmatched by IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and
other computer makers.
   Unisys, the nation's third-largest computer company, said its
Integrated Information Environment would provide software that
would mask the differences between Unisys machines and those of
other companies so they can be joined in a network.
   Unisys said it would do this by adhering to the increasingly
popular ``open systems'' strategy, in which computers and software
follow sets of industry standards so they can be used
interchangably.
   ``It's a milestone in the strategy we've been pursuing since
Burroughs and Sperry became one,'' said James Unruh, Unisys'
president and chief executive, referring to the 1986 merger that
formed the company.
   However, Unisys' plan is similar in many aspects to the
strategies of other computer companies as they contend with
computer users who want their machines to operate together no
matter which brand. That means Unisys will face tough competition.
   ``They have no choice - it's a standards world,'' said Daniel
Mandresh, a computer analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. But, he said,
``You've got to capture the customer before the other guy.''
   As part of its plan announced at a news conference here, Unisys
said it would provide a new version of the operating system for its
mainframe computers. Operating systems control a computer's
internal functions.
   The new mainframe operating system will allow the machines to
serve as ``information hubs'' in networks with other types of
computers, Unisys said.
   That strategy is similar to a plan announced last month by
International Business Machines Corp., which also said it wants to
position the mainframe at the center of computer networks that link
personal computers and midsize machines.
   But Unisys claims its strategy for linking computers of
different makes differs from that of IBM and other companies
because it is not based on the computers themselves but on an
overlay of software based on industry standards.
   The strategy also differs from that of NCR Corp., which
announced last month that it would replace its entire computer line
with models based on industry standards.
   In contrast, Unisys has said it will continue to make its two
older mainframe lines, based on proprietary standards, but will
mesh them with other machines with the new software.
   On another matter, Unruh said the company's directors put great
thought into their decision last week to eliminate Unisys'
quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share. The move is designed to
save cash and help reduce Unisys' debt. He said that
``philosphically'' Unisys wanted to pay stockholders a dividend,
but that it would not resume doing so until ``the company's
profitability and capital structure warrant it.''
   Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., has been struggling to return
to profitability since reporting a $639 million loss last year.
Last October, it announced it would eliminate more than 8,000 jobs,
close plants and refocus its mishmash of product lines inhereted
from its predecessor companies.
   Unruh again said the company expected to report a loss for the
third quarter but that it expected a profit in the fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Chairman Denies Allegations Of Improper Share Dealings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asil Nadir, chairman of Polly Peck International
PLC, Monday night denied allegations of improper dealings in the
shares of the beleaguered conglomerate.
   Polly Peck's shares have been suspended from trading since Sept.
20 when their price fell 55 percent within hours. The stock traded
at 108 pence ($2.04) at the time of the suspension, a 135-pence
slide ($2.55) from its close a day earlier.
   Nadir's statement Monday night said: ``Any suggestions that I
have been involved in improper share dealing are false.''
   Polly Peck's interests span Turkish leisure industries, Japanese
electronics and North American and European fresh fruit
distribution.
   The stock crashed after it was revealed that investigators from
the Serious Fraud Office had searched the London premises of a
company called South Audley Management.
   Nadir, Polly Peck's largest shareholder, said in his statement
Monday night that South Audley Management is owned indirectly by a
Nadir family trust of which he is a principal beneficiary.
   He said it provides management and administration services to
the other Nadir family interests.
   ``There is no connection between Polly Peck and South Audley
Management,'' he said.
   On Sept. 20, Nadir was interviewed for 3{ hours by investigators
of the Serious Fraud Office.
   The Serious Fraud Office is a department of the attorney
general, the governments's senior law officer. Working with the
police and staffed by lawyers and accountants, it investigates and
prosecutes cases where serious fraud is alleged.
   He said of his Sept. 20 interview by the Serious Fraud Office:
``I attended a meeting at their office and answered the questions
put to the best of my information.''
   He said he had informed the Stock Exchange of all transactions
of which he was aware involving Polly Peck shares and companies in
which he held an interest.
   In a separate statement Monday night, the Polly Peck directors
said they were ``cooperating fully with Serious Fraud Office in
providing them with information and documentation.''
   They added: ``The board has also offered to provide any help it
can to assist with the speedy resolution of this investigation.''
   News reports said Polly Peck is facing a growing liquidity
crisis caused by the share price collapse. One of its bankers has
called a meeting of lenders for Friday to plan a financing package.
   The steering committee of London's Stock Exchange said Monday it
would remove Polly Peck shares from the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index, effective immediately.
   The index represents Britain's top 100 stocks in terms of market
capitalization, and the exchange's committee adjusts the index at
least four times a year.
   Food and commodities concern Dalgety PLC will replace Polly Peck
in the key index, beginning Tuesday, the stock exchange said.

   Layoffs at a company that supplies meat to
McDonald's Northeast restaurants is the latest indication that
Americans are looking beyond the burger for fast-food fixes,
analysts said on Monday.
   The Equity Group, a processor of hamburger patties and steaks
for McDonald's, gave notice Friday to 54 of its 115 employees that
they would be laid off Oct. 26.
   The layoffs are to let the subsidiary of Philadelphia-based
Keystone Foods ``reposition itself for the 1990s,'' said Andrew
Kornick, vice president and general manager of the plant just north
of Albany.
   Kornick would not say Monday what precipitated the layoffs.
   But he told the Albany Times-Union on Friday that the cuts at
the plant, which produces exclusively for McDonald Corp., were
``due to a national decline in beef consumption.''
   McDonald's Northeast regional coordinator, Terri Capatosto,
denied hamburger consumption has fallen. She said work at the
upstate New York plant has been moved to plants in Pennsylvania and
Ohio to be closer to beef suppliers in the Midwest and Southwest.
   ``We are in fact selling more hamburgers this year than last ...
by several million pounds,'' she said.
   Overall sales at McDonald's have risen 8 percent in the first
six months of 1990 compared with the first half of last year,
Capatosto said. She could not say how much of the increase could be
attributed to hamburger sales.
   Hugh Zurkuhlen, an industry analyst with Salomon Bros. in New
York, said the layoffs were the first of their kind he had heard
about. He said they are probably due to the ``double hit'' of a
weak economy and the national decline in beef consumption.
   ``There's no question that beef consumption could have something
to do with it,'' Zurkuhlen said.
   ``Restaurant sales in the industry are very, very soft, and any
future growth in sales in McDonald's is not likely to come from
hamburgers. They account for less than 50 percent of sales.''
   Kathy Duguid, regional marketing supervisor for McDonald's in
Albany, said she could not comment on Equity's decision or reveal
the company's meat patty demand from Equity.
   The burger, once the undisputed king of fast food, began facing
challenges in the 1980s as health-conscious Americans switched from
fat-heavy beef to lighter fare. Fast-food restaurants began
offering more non-beef items.
   McDonald's introduced Chicken McNuggets in 1983, salads in 1987
and a chicken sandwich in 1989.
   In May, Miami-based Burger King Corp., the nation's No. 2
fast-food chain after McDonald's, introduced the ``BK Broiler,'' a
broiled chicken sandwich on an oat bran bun.
   Cori Zywotow, director of media relations for the chain, said
the new sandwich has been a ``tremendous success.'' She said the
company is selling 1 million BK Broilers a day, already half as
much as Burger King's flagship sandwich, ``The Whopper.''
   Burger King, like other fast-food chains, does not release a
breakdown of sales figures.
   Hardee's Food Systems Inc., which ranks right behind Burger
King, has in the last 18 months introduced a non-fried chicken
sandwich and ``The Lean 1,'' advertised as the quarter-pound
hamburger with the least total fat - 18 grams - in the fast-food
market.
   ``Look at the menus at any of the burger giants and it becomes
clear that Americans are leaning to more low-fat, low cholesterol
items,'' said Jerry Singer, director of public relations for the
Rocky Mount, N.C.-based chain.
   ``Sales of red meat in the entire industry have been declining
for the past five years,'' he said. ``White meat has been on the
increase for the past five years.''
   James Murren, an industry analyst with C.J. Lawrence, suggested
that a decline in beef production probably wouldn't be enough in
itself to cause the layoffs. He said he thinks the plant likely
closed because of reduced overall sales at McDonald's.
   ``McDonald's is declining most severely in the Northeast,'' he
said.
   Michael Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, said the
layoffs also could reflect sales losses McDonald's has incurred
since 1988 due to lower-priced competition and delays in
diversifying their menu.
   ``A lot of McDonald's problems are self-inflicted,'' Mueller
said.
   Zurkuhlen said that although the hamburger will probably never
regain the dominance it once had, it will remain a fast-food anchor
for the foreseeable future.
   ``Hamburgers are always going to be part of McDonald's as long
as people are eating them,'' he said.
