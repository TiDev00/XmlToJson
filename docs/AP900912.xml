<HEAD>Comedian Accused Attorney of Giving Him No Respect</HEAD>

   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield, angered over
questions about the severity of an eye injury he says he suffered
in a steam bath accident at Caesars Palace, lashed out Wednesday at
a lawyer for the casino-hotel.
   Attorney Louis Meisinger, defending the casino against a lawsuit
filed by Dangerfield, questioned the comedian about the extent of
problems he has had since the March 1988 incident.
   ``What you're trying to do is make a liar out of me and I'm
not,'' Dangerfield told Meisinger during his second day on the
stand.
   ``You have a way of putting things in people's mouths,''
Dangerfield said at one point.
   The comment drew a rebuke from U.S. District Judge Roger Foley.
   Meisinger spent the morning session in a painstaking
interrogation of Dangerfield, mostly about his actions following
the backstage accident that prompted him to cancel several shows at
the Las Vegas Strip resort.
   Dangerfield is suing Caesars for non-payment of the $45,000 a
show he was to receive, plus $5 million in damages. Caesars filed a
countersuit seeking $100,000 plus punitive damages.
   Dangerfield testified that he must put salve in his eyes nightly
or he wakes up in extreme pain in the morning, a condition he
blamed on the accident.
   ``The condition is always there now, every minute. It was never
there before,'' he said.
   Meisinger tried to show that Dangerfield had gone to doctors for
eye problems since 1977, and that he had used a dangerous
prescription analgesic that doctors warned him against.
   The only flash of humor came when the attorney produced records
showing Dangerfield's vision had improved from 20-30 in his right
eye in 1977 to 20-25 in December 1988.
   ``I can't wait until I'm real old,'' Dangerfield replied. ``I'll
have 10-10 then.''
   Dangerfield testified earlier that he scalded his eyes so bad he
had to cancel shows at Caesars because he was in too much pain to
be funny.
   Dangerfield said he got relief from the pain only by wearing
sunglasses, which he said he could not wear onstage and still get
laughs.
   ``I can't work with sunglasses,'' he said. ``It's not my image.''
   Dangerfield admitted, however, that he went to see other
comedians performing on the Las Vegas Strip one of the nights he
missed, and went to a boxing match another night.
   ``It was better than sitting in my room doing nothing,'' he said.
   Dangerfield missed shows on March 17, 18 and 19, then performed
March 20 and 21 before cancelling a March 22 show before a packed
house.
   He said he walked onstage and cancelled the March 22 show
because he was miffed over an effort by Caesars to delay paying him
for the shows he missed.
   Dangerfield left Caesars after that and now performs across the
Strip, at Bally's Hotel.

<HEAD>U.S. Commander Says Two Months More Needed</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf,
though adequate to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq, won't be
completed for about two months, the U.S. commander is quoted as
saying.
   Such a completion would be about a month later than had been
reported earlier.
   ``Give me another couple of months and we will surely have the
forces on the ground that we need to defend Saudi Arabia against
any attack they could possibly have,'' said Army Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf in an interview appearing in Thursday editions of The
Washington Post.
   The interview was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   The general was reported as saying the buildup is currently five
or six days behind schedule because of delays caused by breakdowns
aboard the Navy's eight fast transport ships that were supposed to
have been ready to use at a moment's notice.
   The Navy has been forced to use slower ships.
   Air Force transport flights fell from 80 a day to 70 a day in
the last week and will drop further as the heavily used aircraft
are taken out of service for much-needed maintenance, including
replacement of engines, Schwarzkopf said.
   Only about a third of the Army's heavy tanks have arrived, the
newspaper said.
   Other unidentified officials were quoted as saying the Air Force
planned to complete its deployment of combat units in the next two
weeks and all commando units should be in place in the same period.
   ``The good news is that at the most dangerous time, everything
went great,'' Schwarzkopf said. ``The bad news is that it has
slowed up, but it doesn't matter as much as it did before.''
   The newspaper said officials put the U.S. buildup at 143,000 men
and women, including sailors at sea, and are expecting more than
50,000 additional soldiers. The current total is about 10,000 fewer
than some other reports.

   Relatives of U.S. hostages and soldiers caught up in the Persian
Gulf crisis wanted to know more Tuesday after President Bush
promised the nation that Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait
ultimately will fail.
   They wanted to know how it will end and when their loved ones
might come home.
   Yet at the same time, they knew the president couldn't provide
those answers.
   ``It left me with a non-feeling ... because all I know is that
my husband is hot and miserable and without power,'' said Bonnie
Anderton of Larkspur, Colo., who last week left her husband at the
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``I'm not a political analyst but my basic feeling was kind of
fractured Shakespeare: I'd like a little more matter and a little
less art,'' Mrs. Anderton said after watching Bush's address with
her 10-year-old daughter.
   Bush hailed the ``opportunity to move toward an historic period
of cooperation'' among nations aligned against Saddam's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. And relatives of those in hiding or under the
hot Saudi Arabian sun said they took comfort in his strong stand.
   Still, the president's vigor and words were not enough.
   ``It was a good general talk, but I'm at the point where I need
more than generalities,'' said Donnita Cole of Odessa, Texas. ``I
want specifics. I want my husband.''
   Her husband, oil worker John Cole, is among about 1,800
Americans stranded inside Iraq and Kuwait.
   At the same time, more than 150,000 U.S. combat forces so far
have been deployed to the region.
   For all of their families, the Persian Gulf situation that Bush
painted Tuesday evening already has come home in a very personal
way.
   ``None of us want to fight, but we will if we have to _ and win.
That's what the president was saying ... and I believe him,'' said
David Heard of Manassas, Va., who has two sons on duty in the
Middle East.
   Congress and the public have appeared overwhelmingly supportive
of the military buildup ordered by Bush, but polls have also shown
growing concern over how long it will last and how much it will
cost.
   ``So far the Persian Gulf episode has been a great success story
for Mr. Bush and he is ... basking in the glory,'' said Gary Orren,
a public opionion specialist at Harvard University. ``But any day
now things could get a lot messier.
   ``And then ... things will get much more specific in terms of
what this is costing us and whether it's worth the loss.''

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham battled millionaire
developer J. Fife Symington III and three other Republicans on
Tuesday as he sought an astonishing comeback 2{ years after he was
ousted through impeachment.
   The three others, Sam Steiger, Fred Koory and Bob Barnes,
claimed selection of either Mecham or Symington would split the
party and lead to a Democratic victory in November.
   With 3 percent of precincts reporting, Symington had 1,205 votes
or 45 percent to Mecham's 786 votes or 29 percent.
   The prospect of a low turnout in Arizona was regarded as a
factor that could help Mecham, whose core of loyal supporters could
be counted on to vote. ``If the turnout is under 35 percent, Mecham
could win it,'' said Bruce Merrill, director of the Media Research
Center at Arizona State University.
   Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard had 1,729 votes or 82 percent
in the early going, while perennial candidate David Moss had 379
votes or 18 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who inherited the job when Mecham
was forced out, decided not to run for a full term.
   No one issue dominated the campaign so much as Mecham himself,
although a $350 million tax hike enacted last June angered many
voters.
   Mecham was elected governor in 1986 on his fifth try. His term
in office was short and stormy; he was impeached by the state House
and convicted by the Senate in 1988 on charges of misusing money
from supporters and interfering with a police investigation of an
alleged death threat by one of his aides.
   In office, he was known for a conservative, populist brand of
politics and an outspoken _ some would say bombastic _ personal
style. He drew national attention for some of his positions, most
notably his die-hard opposition to a holiday in honor of Martin
Luther King Jr.
   Symington, the great-grandson of U.S. Steel founder Henry Clay
Frick and nephew of former U.S. Sen. Stuart Symington, spared no
expense in his first campaign for public office and spent much of
his time attacking Mecham for having made Arizona ``the object of
national derision.''
   Steiger, a former congressman and Mecham aide, ran an
old-fashioned campaign, shunning media consultants and taking
positions similar to the ones he espoused while running for
governor as a Libertarian in 1982.
   Koory, a former Maricopa County supervisor, had support from
many of the party's rank-and-file workers. Barnes, a former Mecham
aide and teacher, had little visible support.
   On the Democratic side, Goddard held commanding leads in money,
organization and polls over Moss, a former businessman.

   Political novice Sharon Pratt-Dixon scored an
upset victory Tuesday in the Democratic primary to nominate a
successor to Mayor Marion Barry, while Jesse Jackson gained the
party's backing to become a ``shadow senator'' for the nation's
capital.
   ``It looks wonderful,'' Dixon told supporters. But she refused
to to claim victory.
   ``We're going to wait until we get the final returns _ we don't
count it until we have it. That's exactly how we're going to run
the government,'' Dixon said.
   In the race for the city's non-voting House seat, former Carter
administration official Eleanor Holmes Norton defeated veteran city
councilwoman Betty Ann Kane.
   Former police chief Maurice Turner was unchallenged in the
city's Republican mayoral primary, and attorney Harry Singleton was
the only candidate for the GOP delegate's nomination. But winners
of the city's Democratic primaries will be heavy favorites for
election in November, since Democrats outnumber Republicans by a
9-1 margin.
   Barry announced in advance of his conviction on a single drug
charge earlier this year he would not seek election to a fourth
term as mayor. His decision touched off a chain reaction that
guarantees the city a top-to-bottom realignment of political
leaders next year.
   Dixon won with 35 percent of the vote to 25 percent for city
councilman John Ray, her closest rival, in complete totals from the
city's 140 precincts. Delegate Walter Fauntroy, who gave up his
non-voting House seat to seek Barry's job, finished last in the
five-way field.
   In the race for a non-voting Senate seat, Jackson had 56 percent
of those ballots in a five-way race for a pair of nominations.
   It was Jackson's first time on any ballot other than in a
presidential primary. The unofficial ``shadow senator'' post offers
neither salary nor voting privileges in the Senate, and was
established to lobby Congress to grant statehood to the District of
Columbia.
   Ray led every poll taken in the weeks leading up to the
election, but Dixon gained momentum from an endorsement by The
Washington Post. Barry took a similar path to his first term in
1978, winning a hotly contested three-way race after receiving an
election-week endosrement from the Post.
   Norton had 39 percent of the vote to 33 percent for Kane.
   The battle for the city's non-voting House seat heated up last
weekend after the disclosure that Ms. Norton _ front-runner in the
polls _ had filed no local tax returns from 1982 through 1989. Kane
had hoped an election-eve endorsement by The Washington Post would
push her to victory.
   Norton said she thought her husband had filed the returns, and
over the weekend the couple sent the city more than $25,000 to
settle a 1982 tax dispute.
   Barry is running as an independent this fall for a city council
seat.

   Former Gov. Richard Snelling took the
first step Tuesday toward winning back the office he held for eight
years.
   Snelling, who served as governor from 1977 to 1985, defeated one
minor candidate in the Republican primary to capture a place on the
November ticket against former state Senate President Pro Tem Peter
Welch, who won the Democratic primary.
   With 85 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Snelling had
33,157 votes, or 88 percent, against 4,624 votes, or 12 percent,
for Richard Gottlieb, a perennial candidate of the leftist Liberty
Union party.
   On the Democratic side, Welch had 12,811 votes, or 90 percent,
to Montpelier writer William Gwin's 1,439 votes, or 10 percent.
   Welch, who unsuccessfully sought his party's 1988 congressional
nomination, entered the 1990 gubernatorial contest this spring when
Gov. Madeleine Kunin, also a Democrat, decided not to bid for a
fourth term.
   A contest for the state's lone seat in the U.S. House attracted
wide attention, but mainly for the potential general election
matchup between former Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders, a
socialist, and incumbent Rep. Peter Smith, a Republican.
   Sanders had no primary opposition as an independent; Smith
turned back Timothy Philbin by 24,027 votes to 14,826, a 62-to-38
percent spread.
   Peter Diamondstone and Dolores Sandoval were running
neck-and-neck in the Democratic primary. With 225 of 262 precincts
reporting, Sandoval had 5,319 votes, or 51 percent, to
Diamondstone's 5,077 votes, or 49 percent.

   John Harmer, who served briefly as
California's lieutenant governor under Ronald Reagan, was soundly
beaten Tuesday in his Utah primary bid for a Republican
congressional nomination.
   With 373 of 470 precincts counted, former state senator Karl
Snow had 24,589 votes to 12,394 for Harmer, or 66 percent to 34
percent.
   ``I don't ever expect to resurface in the candidate's role,''
Harmer said. ``I don't ever want to go through this again.''
   Their acrimonious battle for the 3rd Congressional District
nomination was one of two noteworthy GOP congressional contests in
an election with no statewide races. In the otehr, Genevieve Atwood
defeated former congressman Dan Marriott in the 2nd District.
   With 231 of 566 precincts counted, Atwood had 8,725 votes to
Marriott's 5,608, a 61-39 percent split.
   Atwood will face three-term Democratic incumbent Wayne Owens in
November.
   The conservative Harmer, appointed by then-Gov. Reagan in 1974
to fill a vacancy, failed to win election a month after taking
office and served just three months.
   His contest with Snow was marked by charges and counter-charges
of financial troubles and dirty tactics.
   Snow, winning in the most conservative of the state's three
districts, will face Democratic newcomer Bill Orton for the right
to succeed retiring four-term Republican Rep. Howard Nielson.

   The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday had rejected a last-ditch
effort by two other Death Row inmates to block the execution, and
Illinois' high court turned back a challenge from death-penalty
opponents as well. The appeals had argued that the injection system
did not comply with the Illinois capital punishment law.
   Walker, however, had opposed any attempt to save his life,
saying he preferred death to imprisonment for the murders of a
young couple he tied to a tree, shot and robbed. ``I'm guilty. I
can accept my punishment,'' he once said. ``I'm sorry I done it,
yeah, but it's done.''
   Walker became the 139th person executed in the United States
since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling allowing states to
resume use of the death penalty.
   Illinois, which had not put an inmate to death since it sent a
man to the electric chair in 1962, became the 16th state to resume
executions since 1976. Oklahoma became the 15th on Monday.
   Walker watched television, saw visitors and crocheted in his
cell hours before his execution. Outside the prison, about 200
people held a silent candlelight vigil on a foggy hill. Most
opposed the death penalty.
   ``God said, `Thou shalt not kill,' and I don't think he meant
`except when the state of Illinois says it's OK,' '' said Mary
Ellen Evans of Palos Park.

   The case was closely watched by death penalty advocates,
including Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, who praised Gov. James R.
Thompson's refusal Monday to commute Walker's death sentence.
   ``I'm all for Walker being executed,'' Daley said Tuesday.
``Think about the people he killed, didn't they have a right to
live?''
   Walker had said a thirst for alcohol and money led him to kill
Kevin Paule, 21, and his fiancee, Sharon Winker, 25. They were
slain while fishing near Mascoutah in southwestern Illinois.
   Less than eight hours before Walker went to his death, the U.S.
Supreme Court refused a stay by a vote of 6-1, with Justice
Thurgood Marshall, who opposes capital punishment in all
circumstances, voting to block the execution. Justice Harry
Blackmun did not take part in the case.
   The Illinois Supreme Court denied another request to block
Walker's execution. That effort, filed Monday by the Illinois
Coalition Against the Death Penalty, sought to block the state from
using tax money on an execution method that opponents say fails to
comply with the state's death penalty law.
   Walker quit high school in Fayetteville and went to
Jacksonville, Fla., where his criminal record began with a vagrancy
arrest.
   He returned to Fayetteville and worked as a laborer until 1958,
when he was arrested for participating in an auto-theft ring. From
then until 1979, he was in prison most of the time _ for burglary,
for attacking a girlfriend and shooting at police, for robbing a
convenience store.
   In all, he has spent 24 of his 50 years in prison.
   In 1983, Walker decided to visit a favorite fishing spot, where
he met Winker and Paule enjoying an afternoon of fishing along
Silver Creek.
   Walker said he talked with the couple, then decided to rob them.
He said he threatened them with a pistol and began using duct tape
to tie them to trees.
   He planned to leave with their fishing tackle, the $40 in
Paule's wallet and Winker's car. But Paule changed his plans.
   Paule ``said something to the effect of, `You can't get away
with this. I know you. You're Walker,' '' said Sheriff Mearl
Justus. Walker shot each once in the head with a .25-caliber pistol
and left to buy beer.
   That night he robbed a bar and abandoned his car, which held the
couple's fishing tackle and gave police the link between Walker and
the murders. Walker fled to Colorado, but was caught and returned
to Illinois, where he confessed.

   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson won an easy
Republican primary victory Tuesday over an advocate of legal
marijuana and a used-tire salesman.
   He meets Democrat Tom Loftus, the speaker of the Wisconsin
Assembly, on Nov. 6. Loftus was unopposed in the primary.
   With 86 percent of the precincts counted, Thompson rolled up 93
percent, or 172,506 votes. Ben Masel, a marijuana legalization
activist who appeared nude in campaign posters proclaiming
``Nothing to Hide,'' had 5 percent, or 9,757. Edmund Hou-Seye, a
used-tire salesman who promised to cut bureaucracy by firing half
the state's employees, had 2 percent, or 4,156 votes.
   In his first term, Thompson, 48, championed economic development
and welfare experiments that require recipients to work or attend
school.
   He scheduled a debate Wednesday with Loftus.

<TEXT>
   The army-backed caretaker government
today filed more charges of corruption against ousted Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto in what she sees as a political vendetta
against her.
   The charges were filed in the provincial capital of Punjab,
before a special one-judge court set up by the caretaker government
to try graft cases and disqualify candidates from the scheduled
Oct. 24 election.
   Ms. Bhutto is planning to contest at least four seats in the
217-seat National Assembly, the law-making lower house of
Parliament. Nominations were to close at midnight tonight.
   Meanwhile, another special court in Lahore threw out a
corruption charge against one of Ms. Bhutto's former Cabinet
ministers, citing lack of evidence.
   The caretaker government, comprised of Ms. Bhutto's most
outspoken critics and former allies, provided few details about the
charges against the former prime minister.
   Justice Rashid Aziz Khan is expected to begin the proceedings on
Sept. 16.
   Ms. Bhutto had no comment about the latest charges against her,
but earlier said the caretaker government's action was ``a
political vendetta.''
   The 37-year-old former prime minister, head of the Pakistan
People's Party, was dismissed Aug. 6 by President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, who accused the 20-month-old government of rampant
corruption, nepotism and abuse of power.
   Earlier this week, the caretaker government, which accuses Ms.
Bhutto of heading Pakistan's most corrupt and inept government,
filed two corruption charges before a special tribunal in Karachi,
her hometown. The judge set a hearing for Sept. 18 to decide
whether to accept the cases.
   The charges allege she misused her power by hiring a foreign
consulting firm with an Asian Development Bank loan to oversee a
power project in Karachi and awarding a lucrative contract to a
British firm to export cotton at rates below the international
market.
   If convicted of any charge, the tribunals could not only
disqualify her from next month's polls but bar her from politics
for seven years.
   Ms. Bhutto, who won election in November 1988 and took office a
month later as the first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation, has
previously she will not appear before the tribunals. If she
refuses, legal experts she could be arrested.
   At least five former Cabinet ministers had been charged with
corruption and more than 100 supporters have been arrested in the
past month.
   Besides her ministers and supporters, Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif
Ali Zardari, also is a key target of corruption investigations. The
caretaker government has alleged Zardari used the prime minister's
position to hand out government jobs to friends and to demand
commissions on government contracts.
   Zardari, a Karachi businessman, has not been charged and he has
repeatedly denied the allegations.
   He has announced he will seek a seat in the federal legislature.

   The thrill-seeking sport of bungee
jumping was banned today pending review of an accident that injured
the former Miss Australia and an experienced jumper.
   Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss Australia ended Monday,
suffered a broken collarbone when a cord came free as she and a
staff member of the Bungee Bats group plunged 130 feet.
   John Fahey, the New South Wales industrial relations minister,
said the sport would be outlawed pending a report into the
accident. It was not immediately clear whether jumps would be
allowed elsewhere in Australia.
   Ms. McCurry made a successful solo jump from a cage suspended by
a crane off Sydney's Birkenhead Point. She then took a tandem
plunge with crew member Andy Gulby.
   They had their arms wrapped around each other, and elastic cords
attatched to their ankles were supposed to stop their fall a couple
of yards above the water.
   But one of the cords broke free from the cage, leaving only the
other to support the couple's combined weight.
   They hit the water and went under before the remaining cord
stretched back. Then they dangled upside down for several minutes
with their heads just above the surface.
   An ambulance spokesman said they were treated for neck and back
injuries and taken to nearby Balmain hospital.
   Bungee Bats director Wayne Page said all regular safety checks
had taken place before the pair jumped.
   He said the jumpers had gone through the usual weigh-ins, where
cords were allocated with a tension to match their combined weight
so they would not hit the water.
   ``We don't really know what caused the problem,'' he said.
   Bungee Bats began public jumps in Sydney last month after a
three-month battle with the Department of Industrial Relations over
safety concerns. The department granted approval after tightening
safety standards, which included shortening cords to ensure jumpers
did not enter the water.
   Participants pay $56 per jump.
   One fatality and another serious injury have been reported in
New Zealand, where the activity got its commercial start two years
ago.
   France recently introduced rules on bungee-jumping after three
deaths in 1989.

   Primary voters set up the third
gubernatorial battle in six years between Republican incumbent
Edward D. DiPrete and Democratic businessman Bruce G. Sundlun.
   With New England's economy sagging, DiPrete is vulnerable in his
bid for a fourth two-year term, polls taken before Tuesday's
primary indicated. DiPrete's approval rating, 70 percent two years
ago, hovered around 20 percent.
   DiPrete overwhelmed his sole GOP primary challenger; Sundlun
finished 9 percentage points ahead of his closest competitor in a
field of three.
   Former Rep. Edward P. Beard's comeback try fell short as
Democrat John F. Reed easily won the Democratic primary in the 2nd
Congressional District. Trudy Coxe won the district's GOP primary.
   DiPrete said voters wouldn't have to change governors to get
change in state government.
   ``We feel that the voters of this state have been signaling that
they want change and we are prepared to bring the experience and
the plans for major change,'' DiPrete said. He did not elaborate.
   Sundlun, a 70-year-old millionaire, spent more than $2 million
to gain the nomination.
   ``We started with little or nothing and achieved probably the
most amazing come-from-behind and politically decisive victory,''
Sundlun said.
   DiPrete won 71 percent, or 7,418 votes, against former radio
talk show host Steve White. Sundlun got 67,260 votes, or 41
percent, to 32 percent for Warwick Mayor Francis X. Flaherty and 27
percent for Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino, who had the party's
endorsement.
   DiPrete beat Sundlun by fewer than 7,000 votes out of 400,000
cast in a 1988 campaign marked by ethics questions. DiPrete beat
Sundlun by a 2-1 margin in 1986.
   In the House race, Reed won 49 percent to Beard's 28 percent in
a field of four.
   ``This was my last shot,'' said Beard, a former house painter
whose Capitol Hill trademark during his three terms was the brush
he carried in his coat pocket.
   Ms. Coxe won the GOP nomination with 69 percent over accountant
David Gingerella.
   The seat is open because Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider is
challenging 30-year veteran Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.

   A Russian parliamentary committee called today for
the immediate withdrawal of Soviet military specialists from Iraq,
even though it could endanger 5,800 Soviet citizens still in that
country.
   The international affairs committee of the republic's parliament
also called for suspension of the Soviet treaty of friendship and
cooperation with Iraq, the official news agency Tass reported.
   ``Under the present circumstances, the committee believes it
unacceptable and immoral to maintain any contacts in the military
sphere with the aggressor,'' Tass said.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told the Soviet
parliament that the military men would leave as their contracts
end. He said the government was worried about what might happen to
the 5,800 Soviet citizens if the advisers are pulled out right away.
   ``If the contracts are not fulfilled by our side, that will
concern not only our military specialists, but also a very large
group of civilian specialists,'' he said.
   ``As soon as their contracts are finished, they will leave,'' he
added. He did not say exactly when that would be.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug 2., it has held thousands of
Westerners as hostages against possible attack by the U.S.-led
multinatioonal force building in the Persian Gulf region.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's largest arms supplier and a longtime
ally, cut off weapons shipments on Aug. 3, the day after Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
   But about 190 military specialists remain, training Iraqi
soldiers to use and repair their Soviet gear.
   The issue of Soviet military specialists in Iraq has been a
concern of President Bush, who encouraged President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at Sunday's summit in Finland to withdraw the advisers
from Iraq. Gorbachev refused.
   The Baghdad government has allowed the Soviet Union to evacuate
nearly 3,000 of its citizens, including all 883 from Kuwait, all
274 children from Iraq and most of the 699 women from that country,
Shevardnadze said.
   He said the 5,800 Soviets, mostly men working on civilian
construction projects, remain behind.
   In the past, Soviet spokesmen have refused to say whether their
citizens were barred from leaving. They deliberately blurred their
answers to reporters' questions to avoid accusing Iraq of holding
the Soviets as hostages.
   Shevardnadze also acknowledged Tuesday that financial
considerations played a role in the Soviet decision to fulfill its
contracts in Iraq, despite the U.N. embargo on trade with that
country.
   ``We also would have to make up for the financial losses''
amounting to tens of millions of dollars, he told the legislature.
``We must keep these material facts in mind when we decide the
question of withdrawal of our specialists.''
   The Soviet economy is in dire straits. Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov told the legislature earlier in the day that imports of
medicine and consumer goods would have to be cut by two-thirds due
to a shortage of foreign currency.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union is already suffering
financially from the Persian Gulf crisis. It has not received an
expected $800 million worth of oil and hard currency from Iraq and
Kuwait this year, he said.
   The foreign minister said only about 90 to 95 of the 190
military specialists are engaged in direct work with the Iraqi
armed forces. Many of the others are translators and other support
personnel, he said.
   He also said the Soviet Union might be willing to send troops to
the gulf to participate in a U.N. peacekeeping force if Iraqi
troops leave Kuwait.
   After hearing Shevardnadze's report, legislators passed a
resolution approving Soviet policy in the crisis and the joint
U.S.-Soviet statement at the Helsinki summit condemning the
invasion.
   The vote was 277-19 with 61 abstentions.

   A helicopter dropping water on a forest
fire crashed in a ravine of charred timber, killing the pilot,
authorities said.
   The accident occurred Tuesday while 250 firefighters, three air
tankers and another helicopter battled a 970-acre blaze in the
steep, rugged terrain near Silver Creek in northeastern Washington.
   The Bell 204 helicopter that crashed on the Colville Indian
Reservation, about 10 miles east of Keller, was under contract from
Can-Air of Castlegar, British Columbia, said tribal police Sgt.
Gary Carden.
   The pilot's identity was not immediately released. He was killed
on impact, authorities said.
   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration were to
inspect the wreckage today, Carden said. The cause of the crash,
which destroyed the helicopter, was not known, he said.
   Fire crews hoped to finish digging a line around the fire today,
officials said. The fire started Monday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is finding himself drawn by the
Persian Gulf crisis into a role he once shunned as much as Ronald
Reagan relished: television communicator.
   Bush's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening
_ his third in 20 months in office _ was the latest installment in
a battle of the airwaves that Bush, the reluctant communicator, is
waging with Saddam Hussein.
   Unable so far to budge the Iraqi leader from Kuwait with a
massive U.S. military presence or international sanctions, Bush has
been engaging in a series of high-profile events choreographed to
showcase world unity.
   After all, Saddam himself has been making extensive use of
television to attempt to influence public opinion in broadcasts
aired by the Cable News Network.
   Last weekend's orchestrated superpower summit in Helsinki,
arranged by Bush, had a high symbolic content _ the image beamed
around the world of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Bush
standing, as Bush put it, ``shoulder to shoulder'' against Saddam.
   And in his speech to Congress and the nation, the president
sought to deliver the same message, declaring, ``It is Iraq against
the world.''
   He also used the occasion to steel the nation to a possible long
engagement. He said he did not know how long U.S. troops would have
to remain in Saudi Arabia or how long Iraq could endure the
international economic sanctions. But, he declared, ``Let no one
doubt our staying power. We will stand by our friends.''
   Today, Bush videotaped a message to the Iraqi people. The
administration really doesn't have high expectations that Saddam
will allow the tape to be televised in his country, so the message
was made with an eye toward domestic consumption and for viewing in
other Arab nations. It was accompanied by Arabic subtitles and
voice dubbing.
   Saddam had offered to send an Iraqi film crew to interview the
president. Bush rejected that offer but said he would send his own
tape.
   Televised addresses _ including speeches to joint sessions of
Congress _ were Reagan's forte, but Bush has tended to avoid them.
He favors less formal events, and behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
   He acknowledges feeling uncomfortable giving nationally
televised speeches _ a point underscored again Tuesday night, when
Bush on occasion smiled in an inappropriate moment, or failed to
deliver a powerfully written phrase with enough vigor. And that was
after coaching from Roger Ailes, his television coach from the 1988
campaign.
   Regardless, the president's address was warmly received from
both sides of the congressional aisle.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
Bush ``essentially laid out in one document a very comprehensive
argument for our position in the gulf.''
   And Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said, ``If there
are any fence-sitters on the president's decisions in the Middle
East, this speech ought to push them off the fence.''
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Bush has given four
speeches on the crisis and 10 news conferences, all or parts of
which were carried live by the major TV networks.
   And, even though Bush may not have quite the smooth delivery and
timing of former actor Reagan, ``He's just used to different kinds
of forums,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``His approval rating speaks to his ability to talk on
television as good as the best of them,'' Fitzwater added. ``His
techniques are just different.''

   Reusing plastic bread bags to store food
could be hazardous because the paint on the outside may contain
lead, a health official warns.
   People who use the wrappers inside out risk having the lead mix
with their food, Dr. Bernard Goldstein, director of the
Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute in
Piscataway, said Tuesday.
   ``It's ironic that in this case recycling may actually pose an
environmental health risk,'' Goldstein said.
   Because the plastic acts as a barrier between the paint and the
food, lead-based paints aren't considered a hazard on the outside
of a bread bag.
   But once the bags are inverted and used for storage, the paint
can either flake off or be extracted by acids in the food, said
Goldstein.
   The institute's interest in bread wrappers began in late spring
when, in response to a telephone query, it began researching
obscure sources of lead in the environment.
   After finding lead-based paint on 17 of 18 bread wrappers, the
institute surveyed 106 middle-class families in central New Jersey.
Seventeen _ or one out of six _ said they stored food in bread
packaging.
   Exposure to lead levels in bread bag paint is not dangerous in
itself, Goldstein said, but if people continually ingest lead, the
amount in their bloodstream could rise to dangerous levels.
   ``Our advice to consumers is to stop reusing bread bags for food
storage,'' he said.
   Goldstein said evidence is compelling that exposure to even
relatively low levels of lead can harm mental development and
produce hyperactivity in small children. Higher concentrations can
cause mental retardation, he said.

   Forty-nine blacks and a white
policeman were killed in some of the most vicious factional
fighting since violence erupted in townships around Johannesburg a
month ago, police said today.
   A pre-dawn bombing damaged the offices of the governing National
Party, but caused no injuries, police said.
   The deaths occurred Tuesday and early today in the townships
ringing Johannesburg, where battles between rival black groups have
claimed some 700 lives in the past month.
   Worst hit was Tembisa, northeast of Johannesburg, where 25
bodies were found, police said. Also, 13 people were killed in
Vosloorus, seven in Tokoza and one in Katlehong _ all townships
southeast of johannesburg.
   The policeman was killed and three colleagues seriously wounded
when they were ambushed with assault rifles while driving through a
squatter camp in the Soweto township.
   Also in Soweto, three blacks were killed when their yellow van
was riddled with gunfire from AK-47 rifles. The attackers
apparently mistook the van for a police vehicle, most of which are
painted yellow.
   The blast at the deserted National Party offices in Pretoria,
the capital, shattered windows and damaged computer equipment, said
the party's regional secretary Danie Labuschagne.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, which was carried
out with commercial explosives, according to police.
   Extreme right-wing groups have claimed responsibility for
several recent nighttime bombings, including attacks on other
National Party offices. Commercial explosives were used in those
bombings.
   White extremists have vowed to resist plans by President F.W. de
Klerk to dismantle the apartheid system of racial segregation and
share power with the black majority.
   Meanwhile, skirmishes continued today in the black townships.
Houses and cars were set alight in Katlehong, Tokoza and
Vosloosrus, southeast of Johannesburg. Corpses remained on the
street in several areas.
   Women and children packed belongings into wheelbarrows and
shopping carts and fled the area.
   In Tokoza, armed men at a squatter camp said they planned to
avenge an overnight attack by Zulus from a nearby migrant workers
hostel. Hundreds of the squatter shacks were burned to the ground
in Tokoza and nearby Vosloosurs.
   ``The Zulus are killing us,'' said one resident of the Tokoza
squatter camp who was carrying an ax. ``Every night they come with
guns.''
   The fighting in Tokoza has been mostly between Zulus in the
hostels and other blacks in the squatter camps, but on Tuesday
night the violence spread to nearby middle-class homes.
   Township residents said white men wearing masks took part in
attacks in the area, a charge made frequently in recent days.
Police say they are investigating, but have no evidence to support
the claim.
   The townhsip fighting erupted Aug. 12 between Zulus loyal to the
conservative Inkatha movement and other blacks supporting the
African National Congress. The fighting spread from the eastern
province of Natal, where the ANC-Inkatha feud has killed about
5,000 blacks since 1986.
   De Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela met Tuesday, but
announced no new plans to stop the bloodshed.
   Mandela accused the government of waging war against the ANC and
said failure to halt fighting threatened talks on ending apartheid.
   ``We will do everything in our power to ensure that the peace
process remains on track, but the government has to do its part,''
Mandela said after Tuesday's meeting. If the government ``is
dragging its feet as it is doing now, then the peace process is
definitely threatened.''

<HEAD>New York Post Could Fold Saturday If Unions Don't Make Concessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saturday's edition of the New York Post, the
nation's oldest continuously published daily, could be its last if
its unions do not come up with millions in concessions demanded by
the publisher.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow told the unions Sept. 4 that he is
losing $27 million annually on the tabloid and that he wants the
unions to relinquish $17.4 million in payroll and $1.9 million in
benefits by Saturday.
   But because he wants to write an editorial either saying goodbye
to New Yorkers or telling them of the Post's survival, Kalikow
changed the deadline on Tuesday to 8 p.m. Friday.
   ``Whatever the decision, he wanted it clearly explained to the
public,'' said Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, a group of newspaper unions,
says that Kalikow has always been honest with the unions and
therefore they are willing to renegotiate the contract that ends
next March.
   Formal talks began Tuesday night with a 90-minute session
covering ground rules, following confirmation by the unions'
auditors that the Post was fighting for its financial life.
   The Allied also is negotiating over contracts that expired in
March at the Daily News, the nation's second largest metropolitan
daily. Talks there have been intense but fruitless since January in
what both sides say is a fight for the newspaper's life.
   The News management demands rights to eliminate rules it says
force it to pay for excess production workers. The unions claim the
News is seeking to eliminate the unions and either sell or shut
down the paper.
   The unions are asking retail advertisers to boycott the News
until a settlement is reached.
   The News has been losing money also and has been hit by an
industrywide advertising decline.
   News management told the Newspaper Guild on Tuesday that it
demands the same concessions the Guild makes to the Post.
   Guild President Barry Lipton said the News' demand was ``a naked
attempt to collapse these negotiations.''
   John T. Sloan, News vice president for human resources, said a
provision in the expired contract guaranteed that concessions made
to one publisher be made to others contracting with the same union.

   Impeached former Gov. Evan Mecham of Arizona failed in his
comeback try and Jesse Jackson won his first primary race for
something other than the presidency as voters selected nominees in
10 states and the District of Columbia.
   Jackson's victory Tuesday in Washington, D.C., was in a
Democratic primary for the purely symbolic post of ``shadow
senator,'' created to lobby for statehood for the city.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown said the party had
nominated ``a strong field of candidates'' for November elections
that he said will hinge largely on domestic issues mishandled by
the GOP and the Bush administration.
   ``American people want to know who's going to clean up the
savings and loan mess, who is going to get this economy moving
again and who is going to provide the leadership to get these
budget deficits under control,'' Brown said.
   ``I've got to feel optimistic about November,'' he said. ``I
wish the general election was tomorrow.''
   Republican National Committee spokeswoman Leslie Goodman was
equally upbeat about the GOP's lineup heading into the fall.
   ``We're very confident of our candidates,'' she said.
   Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich, whose eccentric habits
earned him the nickname ``Governor Goofy,'' won a closely contested
bid for renomination to another term after 10 years in office. With
94 percent of precincts reporting, Perpich had 55 percent to 42
percent for former commerce commissioner Mike Hatch.
   In the Republican race to oppose Perpich, businessman Jon
Grunseth defeated state auditor Arne Carlson and a third candidate.
Perpich said he got the opponent he wanted.
   ``This makes it much easier for us because we've got the middle
ground,'' Perpich said.
   Charles Black, the RNC's chief spokesman, said the fact that
Democrats had nominated Perpich gives Republicans ``a great chance
to win the governorship'' in November.
   Other incumbents had an easy time on the biggest primary day of
the election year, and one which nearly completes the fall election
lineup.
   Three Republican governors easily won renomination: Judd Gregg
in New Hampshire, Edward DiPrete in Rhode Island and Tommy Thompson
in Wisconsin.
   Democratic Gov. William Donald Schaefer coasted to renomination
in Maryland.
   One former governor who was making a comeback try, Vermont's
Richard Snelling, easily won his Republican primary and will face
Democrat Peter Welch in the fall. Snelling served four two-year
terms before retiring in 1984, and was succeeded by Democrat
Madeleine Kunin, who decided not to run again this year.
   Mecham lost to Phoenix developer J. Fife Symington in the race
for the GOP nomination for governor of Arizona. Former Mayor Terry
Goddard of Phoenix, son of a former governor, swamped his opponent
in the Democratic primary.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Symington had 44 percent
to Mecham's 24 percent, and the rest was divided among three other
candidates.
   ``I'll support Fife,'' Mecham said. ``Even he'll be better than
Goddard. As I've said many times, Goddard will be a 100 percent
disaster. Fife will only be an 80 percent disaster.''
   Mecham, a former car dealer, was impeached in 1988 after two
tumultuous years as governor in which he stirred controversy for
his outspoken opposition to establishing the Martin Luther King
holiday and drew charges of financial wrongdoing. Democratic Gov.
Rose Mofford, who inherited the job when Mecham was forced out,
decided not to run for a full term.
   In Washington, D.C., Sharon Pratt Dixon, who had been an
also-ran in pre-election polls, scored a surprising victory in the
Democratic primary for mayor to succeed Marion Barry. Barry,
convicted on a single drug count in August, is running as an
independent in November for a city council seat.
   ``The bottom line now is to close ranks,'' said Dixon, a former
utility company executive and Democratic National Committee member
who was making her first bid for elective office. She will face
former police chief Maurice Turner, a Republican, though she will
be heavily favored in the city where Republicans are outnumbered 9
to 1.
   Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate who moved to the
heavily black city from Chicago just last year, had 57 percent of
the vote in a five-way race for a pair of nominations for unpaid
``shadow senator'' posts that carry neither voting nor floor
privileges.
   Nonetheless, it was Jackson's first time on any ballot other
than in a presidential primary.
   In another D.C. race, Eleanor Holmes Norton narrowly won
nomination for the city's non-voting congressional delegate,
despite a weekend disclosure that she and her husband had failed to
file city tax returns over an eight-year period. Norton said she
thought her husband had filed them.
   She is seeking the post given up by Delegate Walter Fauntroy,
who ran last in the Democratic mayoral primary won by Dixon.
   In a closely watched congressional race, Rep. Roy Dyson, a
Maryland Democrat, won renomination in a Democratic primary over
state legislator Barbara Kreamer and two others. He was considered
one of the most vulnerable congressional incumbents and had been
shaken by the recent disclosure that he avoided military service as
a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War _ a contrast to his
hawkish positions on defense issues in Congress.
   Dyson won 54 percent of the vote against three opponents. He
will face Republican Wayne Gilchrest, who narrowly lost to Dyson in
1988 and defeated seven opponents for the GOP nomination.
   In Rhode Island, 70-year-old Democrat Bruce Sundlun won a tough
three-way primary for the nomination to oppose DiPrete, defeating
Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. and Warwick Mayor Francis X.
Flaherty.
   DiPrete has defeated Sundlun in the last two elections, but the
Republican governor's popularity has sunk with the state's
beleaguered economy, and Democrats believe he is vulnerable this
time.
   ``It's deja vu, here we go again,'' said DiPrete.
   Sundlun called DiPrete ``an opponent from whom I expect the
worst,'' and said, ``Governor DiPrete showed last time that he will
stop at nothing to win an election and we have no reason to believe
that he has changed his stripes.''
   In the race for New Hampshire's open Senate seat, Rep. Bob Smith
defeated Thomas Christo and two others for the Republican
nomination.
   Former Sen. John Durkin won the Democratic nomination in his bid
for a return to the Senate from New Hampshire. The seat is vacant
because of the retirement after two terms of conservative GOP Sen.
Gordon Humphrey.
   Lowering his sights, Humphrey, 49, won the Republican primary
for a state Senate seat, a job that pays $100 a year.
   Former New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Joe Grandmaison
won his party's nomination to challenge Gregg in the governor's
race.
   Minnesota Sen. Rudy Boschwitz had no trouble against token
opposition in the Republican primary. He will face Paul Wellstone,
a political science professor who won the Democratic primary.
   In Connecticut's governor's race, Rep. Bruce A. Morrison
defeated state legislator William J. Cibes Jr. The retiring
incumbent, William O'Neill, is a Democrat, but Morrison goes into
the three-way general election an underdog, largely because of the
state's poor economy and record-setting tax increases of the past
two years.
   He will face Republican Rep. John G. Rowland and the
front-runner, former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, a Republican running
as an independent.
   In a test of abortion as an issue, two veteran Maryland state
senators were handily defeated by abortion-rights candidates.
Pro-choice forces said the defeat of state Sens. Frank Shore and
Margaret Schweinhaut helps them achieve a filibuster-proof state
Senate. Abortion rights activists were galvanized by a bitter
anti-abortion filibuster last March that prevented passage of a
liberal abortion bill.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $1.9 Million to Fired Hughes Aircraft Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury awarded a fired Hughes Aircraft worker
$1.9 million after finding the company retaliated against him for
uncovering alleged overcharges on government military contract work.
   Hughes spokesman Bill Herrman said an appeal would be filed.
   A Superior Court jury deliberated one week before deciding
Tuesday in favor of Bobby Coffey, a former program control
administrator in Hughes' radar system group. The jury also found
the 55-year-old was fired because of his age.
   ``The message that Hughes needs to understand is that it is not
a one way street,'' said Coffey's attorney Melanie Lomax. ``You
don't just discard older workers like used toilet paper.''
   Hughes attorney Joel Krischer contended that the Woodland Hills
resident was terminated because he charged eight hours overtime
that he did not work.
   The jury found Coffey had been fired without cause. The panel
found Hughes had improperly billed the government and acted with
malice against Coffey.
   Coffey said he had an exemplary work record in 11 years with
Hughes until he pointed out inconsistencies involving government
contracts in 1983-84.
   A former Pentagon contracts officer and another ex-Hughes
employee filed separate lawsuits against the company charging about
$70 million in inflated labor costs from 1983-89 and flaws in 4
million defense system microchips.
   Both lawsuits were dropped earlier this year.
   The jury awarded Coffey $127,477 in economic damages, $75,000
for emotional damages and $1.75 million in punitive damages.
   ``Mr. Coffey says he feels like a much younger man,'' Coffey's
attorney said. ``He has the satisfaction of knowing that Hughes was
wrong.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Deficit-Reduction Top Priority Despite Gulf Crisis,
Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and the Bush administration should
not use the weakening economy or the Persian Gulf crisis as excuses
to avoid a significant deficit-reduction plan this year, the
General Accounting Office said today.
   The GAO, an arm of Congress, offered the advice as it issued a
report saying the deficit could reach a staggering $400 billion
next year if the economy slides into a recession.
   The latest forecast from the White House Office of Management
and Budget is for a $230 billion deficit _ a far smaller figure
chiefly because OMB uses surpluses in Social Security and other
trust funds to offset shortages in general government accounts.
Just nine months ago, OMB forecast a $100 billion deficit.
   Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who heads GAO, used the
words ``out of control'' to describe the deficit. Within a year, he
told a news conference, the federal government will be spending
more for interest on its debt than on the military.
   The GAO report, which lists a series of options for correcting
the problem but makes no recommendations, was issued by Sens.
J.James Exon, D-Neb., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, members of the
Senate Budget Committee.
   Exon praised the report as ``a frank and telling assessment of
the magnitude of the federal budget crisis,'' but acknowledged he
opposes farm-program cuts outlined by GAO.
   Grassley said the report makes clear that the $50 billion
one-year deficit reduction that the administration and
congressional leaders are trying to put together would be only a
first step. ``This report says we've got to lower the deficit by
... $1.05 trillion by 1997,'' he said.
   The report noted the economy is weakening and says this fact
calls for caution in the timing of short-term tax increases and
spending reductions.
   Also, ``The situation in the Middle East calls for prudence in
shaping short-term defense budget decisions while accentuating the
need to reassess the forces needed to meet future post-Cold War
threats,'' GAO wrote.
   ``We urge the administration and the Congress to consider
alternatives that take all of these factors into account but not to
use them as an excuse for postponing action,'' the report stated.
``None of them changes the size or nature of the long-term
fundamental problem the country faces.''

<HEAD>House Panel Nears Vote on Aid to Angolan Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Intelligence Committee neared a vote
today on helping the rebels of Jonas Savimbi in Angola, and sources
said it was ``a close call'' whether the aid would be cut for the
first time since it began.
   Whether the aid was cut or not, conditions would probably be
attached to its use, said one source, who spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
   It would be the first crack in the almost unanimous
congressional support for Savimbi that has been built up in
Washington since 1986 by a well-financed lobbying operation.
   But support for Savimbi has been eroded by peace initiatives
throughout the world, improved ties with the Soviet Union _ which
is Angola's main backer _ and growing budget problems here.
   A clear sign of this came this summer when the Senate
Intelligence Committee put off a decision on Savimbi's aid for the
fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. The panel agreed to decide on the
aid figure later this year in a joint conference with the House
committee, said another source.
   ``It's a close call'' in the House, said the source, speaking of
the closed-door vote planned for later in the day. Current aid is
estimated at $60 million or more.
   Today's vote is part of a covert aid bill that includes proposed
money for rebels in Cambodia and Afghanistan.
   An Angolan official lobbying to defeat the aid has been telling
members of Congress and the administration this week that
right-wing South Africans, with the tacit approval of their white
minority government, are providing the U.S.-armed rebels with
weapons.
   Maj. Gen. Roberto Leal Monteiro, chief military adviser to
Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, is also arguing that
further U.S. aid to the rebels prolongs the 15-year civil war in
his country.
   Two ships from South Africa recently docked at the port of
Matadi in Zaire and unloaded two Puma helicopters and a group of
uniform-clad black Angolan mercenaries or rebels, Monteiro said.
   Angolan intelligence believes white right-wing extremists
opposed to an emerging settlement between South Africa's white
minority government and the country's black majority are forging
alliances with radicals in the region, Monteiro said.
   South Africa was Savimbi's biggest arms supplier until last
year, when it agreed to stop as part of a regional peace plan.
   But, Monteiro said, the government has turned a blind eye to
some of the radicals' activities, including their regular flights
ferrying weapons to the Angolan rebels via an air strip in
Lubumbashi, Zaire.
   Monteiro is arguing that his government has done all the United
States has asked _ agreeing to hold multiparty elections and
changing to a market-oriented economy _ and yet the administration
keeps aiding Savimbi.

   The four World War II powers that defeated and
carved up Nazi Germany signed a treaty today with the two Germanys
sanctioning their unification and heralding the return of their
full sovereignty.
   Foreign ministers from the United States, the Soviet Union,
France and Britain signed the historic document along with
representatives from the two German states in the Soviet Communist
Party's plush Oktyabrskaya Hotel.
   The so-called two-plus-four agreement is the last major document
needed to clear the way for unification and will lead to an end of
the World War II Allies' special rights on German soil.
   It marks the crowning of months of sometimes worried talks over
Germany's future strategic role. Nagged by the specter of Germany's
Nazi past, some nations expressed concern over what they perceived
as the potential threat of a single nation of 80 million Germans in
the heart of Europe.
   The treaty thus incorporates built-in limits _ demanded by the
Soviets _ on the Germans' military might. It also contains the
Germans' acknowledgment that they cannot regain lands forfeited to
Poland after the Nazis' defeat in 1945.
   The end of the special powers for the World War II Allies above
all concerns Berlin, which is now technically under the
adminstration of the four nations and not part of West Germany.
After unification, Berlin becomes one city within a united Germany.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev watched West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher affixed the first signature,
followed by East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   The four Allies were next: French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   After the signing, Shevardnadze shook hands with Genscher and de
Maiziere. The six ministers, plus Gorbachev, drank a champagne
toast.
   ``This treaty marks the end of the Cold War era,'' de Maiziere
said in a speech. ``It is part of the most important body of
European treaties of the postwar period.''
   Western diplomatic sources said the participants did not resolve
until two hours before the treaty was signed a dispute over NATO
troop maneuvers in what is now East Germany after the withdrawal of
Red Army troops by 1994.
   The ministers negotiated until 3 a.m. and again later this
morning before reaching a compromise, the sources said, speaking on
the condition of anonymity. They did not say what the compromise
was.
   Genscher lauded the treaty late Tuesday, saying it marks ``a new
chapter not just in German history but also in European history.''
   The two Germanys have chosen Oct. 3 as their unity date, less
than a year after East Germany's hard-line Communist rulers were
ousted in a peaceful popular revolution.
   Full German sovereignty is expected a couple months later, after
ratification by the legislatures of the four Allies and an
all-German parliament.
   Genscher said the four Allies are expected to sign a pact in New
York on Oct. 1 to suspend Allied rights in Germany after
unification.
   He said the rights, including control over air corridors to
Berlin, will permanently end after the ratification of the treaty.
   In addition to the two-plus-four agreement, Bonn and Moscow have
been negotiating agreements covering long-term financial aid for
the Soviets as well as generous payments to facilitate the
withdrawal of Red Army troops from East Germany. West German
officials say the two strictly German-Soviet documents are nearly
ready to sign.
   The Soviet Union's decision to give full blessing to German
unity has been made in tandem with Bonn's promises of financial
help. The aid will mean a sizable commitment by the Germans to help
salvage the Soviet Union's devastated economy.
   Details on the financial aid package have not been released.
However, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Tuesday that
his government had agreed to pay $7.6 billion for retraining Red
Army troops and for building housing for soldiers returning home to
the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets had demanded about $12 billion to cover the costs
for the four-year withdrawal of the 370,000 Red Army troops from
what is now East Germany. Bonn had initally offered $4.5 billion.
   The final haggling was left to West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Gorbachev, who discussed the matter by telephone Monday.
   The United States and its two Western partners were quick in
giving their approval to German unity, but the Soviets were harder
to move. At first, Moscow stiffly rejected Western insistence a
united Germany belong to NATO.
   The Soviets dropped their objections after a pledge that NATO
troops would not be stationed on what is now East German soil, that
Red Army troops would have up to four years to withdraw, and a
united Germany would keep its troop levels down to 360,000.
   The two German nations have a combined troop strength of about
600,000.
   The celebrations in both Germanys were in contrast with a
statement from an Israeli group today protesting the treaty's
failure to mention the Nazi killings of European Jews during World
War II.
   ``After only a few years the Germans are trying to deny and
erase from their memories the horrible deeds of the German
people,'' wrote Matityahu Drobles, chairman of the Israeli wing of
the World Jewish Congress, in a letter to the West German Embassy
in Tel Aviv.

<HEAD>Judge Stops Distribution of Book on Israeli Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today temporarily barred St. Martin's
Press from distributing a book purporting to expose secrets of the
Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad, the publisher said.
   St. Martin's said the order was signed by state Supreme Court
Justice Michael J. Dontzin at 1:05 a.m. in his home after he heard
oral argument by lawyers but ``without any testimony of witnesses
or formal legal papers.'' Supreme Court in New York state is a
trial-level court.
   The ``extraordinary and unprecedented order'' was issued at the
request of Israel, the publisher said in a statement.
   St. Martin's said it intended to ask an appeals court to vacate
Dontzin's order later today.
   ``We are shocked and dismayed that Israel's attempts to enlist
the support of an American court in censoring this book have so far
met with success,'' said St. Martin's lawyer, David N. Kaye.
   The book, ``By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer,'' was barred from release in Canada, its Canadian
publisher, Stoddart Publishing Co., said earlier this week in
Toronto. The author, Victor Ostrovsky, who collaborated with Ottawa
journalist Claire Hoy on the 300-page book, also was ordered not to
discuss the book.
   Ostrovsky, 40, now living in Canada, claims to have been a
Mossad agent form 1984 to 1986.
   Jonathan Lerner, a lawyer for the Israeli government, declined
to comment today.
   Dontzin set a court date on Friday for arguments on whether the
book should be released.
   The judge said he was acting on Israel's contention that
publication would ``disseminate extremely confidential information
which would, among other effects, endanger the lives of various
people in the employ of the state of Israel, and would be
detrimental to the government of the state of Israel.''
   According to Israeli press reports, the book asserts that the
Mossad had advance knowledge of the terrorist bombing that killed
240 U.S. Marines in Beirut in 1983. It said the Israelis did not
pass the information along because the bombing would worsen
relations between the United States and Arab nations.
   The book also was said to describe Mossad espionage activity
inside the United States.
   Dontzin ordered St. Martin's to stop shipping the book to
bookstores or ``otherwise disseminating any books, essays or
articles containing information provided by the defendant Victor
Ostrovsky or any other person on his behalf'' in connection with
Ostrovsky's work for Mossad.
   Dontzin also directed St. Martin's to recall all of the 17,000
copies believed to have been shipped.

<HEAD>Search Continues For Missing Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Canada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searchers scoured the North Atlantic
today for signs of a Boeing 727 jetliner that ran out of fuel and
ditched at sea with 18 people aboard.
   The jet, owned by Faucett Airlines of Lima, Peru, was carrying
airline employees and members of their families when it disappeared
Tuesday afternoon off Newfoundland.
   Authorities said the plane strayed off course on a flight from
the Mediterranean island of Malta to Miami.
   All of the crew members were from Peru, and it was not clear if
there were any survivors.
   Eight Canadian planes were searching a 60,000-square-mile area
centered 185 miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland, aided by ships. Two
U.S. Air Force planes were sent from Detroit and Iceland to help
search.
   Tom Cole, a spokesman for the Boeing Co. in Seattle, said the
Boeing-designed aircraft was capable of floating after ditching,
perhaps for hours.
   ``We've done a lot of analysis on ditching and we designed the
airplane with that possibility in mind,'' he said.
   The 727's operating manual includes ditching procedures, ``how
to set up the airplane, flaps down, gear up, what kind of speeds
... that kind of thing,'' he said.
   This aircraft was delivered to Western Airlines in 1969 and had
gone through several owners before being bought by Faucett, which
leased it to Air Malta.
   ``We have a number of signals, we have several different
soundings hundreds of miles apart,'' Walt Chipchase, a search and
rescue spokesman in Halifax, said of attempts to find the plane
from its emergency radio beacon.
   Authorities said they had no explanation for unusual signals
picked up by satellites, and did not know if they had come from a
plane or life raft.
   Equally mysterious was why the airplane was so far off course.
   Authorities said the plane should have reached Gander,
Newfoundland at 3 p.m. Tuesday for a routine refueling stop but
that the pilot radioed a fuel emergency at 3:23 p.m. and said he
was ditching hundreds of miles out to sea.
   ``We don't know why it was off course,'' Faucett Airlines
spokesman Betty McDaniel said in Miami.
   The jet had been under contract to Air Malta for about six
months and was being returned to Faucett's operations base in Miami.
   It had stopped in Keflavik, Iceland, but a refueling supervisor
in Keflavik said there was no problem during the stop there.
   Gander, in east central Newfoundland, is a major refueling stop
for international flights between Europe and North America.

   The Bush administration is threatening to veto
any congressionally approved defense bill that hampers the Persian
Gulf operation, which Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says could cost
up to $15 billion in the next year.
   The Pentagon chief offered the cost estimate Tuesday as the
House weighed a $283 billion defense budget for fiscal year 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, and searched for a way to defray the expense
of the U.S. military buildup.
   A decision on using the defense bill as a vehicle for a down
payment on Operation Desert Shield is contingent on White House and
congressional negotiators agreeing on how to cut next year's
federal deficit by $50 billion.
   House Democrats are considering using money originally earmarked
for the Strategic Defense Initiative and a Navy guided-missile
destroyer _ a total of just over $1 billion, said congressional
sources who requested anonymity.
   Another option for lawmakers is to complete the defense budget
and craft a separate, supplemental package to cover the cost of the
gulf operation.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters today he
tends ``to be optimistic we'll reach a conclusion this week'' in
negotiations on paring the deficit.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers today began the first full day of debate on
the defense bill by venting their frustration over the response
from U.S. allies in aiding the campaign against Iraq.
   ``It's time for our allies, especially Japan, to pay their fair
share,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the
Democratic leadership.
   Bonior, the chief deputy whip, said Japan has announced a
package of $1 billion in aid but the assistance ``is a very small
amount compared to what is going to be needed in that region for
the next year.''
   Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday:
   ``We expect these incremental costs to total about $15 billion
in fiscal year 1991 if the crisis continues for the entire fiscal
year. If the conflict occurs, these costs would multiply many
fold.''
   Previous estimates for the cost of massing more than 100,000
U.S. troops in the gulf region were $1 billion a month.
   The defense budget, which the House Armed Services Committee
crafted before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, would slash nearly
$2 billion from President Bush's request for SDI, halt production
of the B-2 bomber and reduce U.S. troop strength by 129,500.
   The measure came under fire Tuesday from the administration and
House Republicans.
   ``If the House bill is enacted in its present form, then the
president's senior advisers and the secretary (Cheney) would
recommend that the president veto it,'' Defense Department
spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.
   He singled out the cuts in strategic programs and the reduction
in active-duty strength that far exceeds the 38,000 called for by
the Pentagon.
   ``That would pose an undue risk to national security, greatly
complicate the department's ability to deal with the current crisis
in the gulf and also rob the department of the flexibility we need
to manage the force draw-down in an effective way,'' Williams said.
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee,
Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, said the legislation ``breaks faith
with the men and women in uniform.''
   A group of House Republicans said the $24 billion cut from
Bush's request of $307 billion in military spending for fiscal 1991
``threatens the security of the United States.''
   Democrats defended the bill as the appropriate response to a
changing world environment in which the Soviet threat to the West
has diminished while conflicts such as the standoff in the Middle
East have moved front and center.
   ``The House Armed Services Committee has fashioned a bill that
makes real progress toward restructuring United States military
forces to meet changing circumstances of the 1990s and beyond,''
Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla. said during debate on the House floor.
   Other lawmakers focused their criticism on the slow response
from U.S. allies toward helping the effort in the gulf, and in
particular the actions taken by Japan.
   Although Japanese officials said Tuesday they are considering
giving $2 billion to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, the House plans to
consider a measure today that would force Japan to pay all the
costs associated with stationing U.S. troops in the Asian nation.
   The House also will weigh several amendments on increasing and
decreasing funds for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars. Votes on all
the legislation was scheduled for late in the day, a move to allow
budget negotiators to meet without interruption.
   On Tuesday, the House rejected an amendment that would have
forced the Navy to close the planned ``home port'' battleship base
at New York City's Staten Island, an installation in which the
Pentagon has invested more than $230 million.
   The House also overwhelmingly approved a measure sponsored by
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., to create a professional work
corps within the Pentagon to purchase weapons and other
defense-related items.
   Meanwhile, the Senate approved, 97-2, a non-binding resolution
saying the United States should prosecute Saddam Hussein and other
Iraqi leaders as ``war criminals'' if hostilities break out in the
gulf.

   President Bush applauded the German
reunification treaty signed in Moscow today as a ``historic
event,'' but sent his regrets that he will be unable to attend the
Oct. 3 ceremonies in Berlin, his spokesman said.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that scheduling problems
prevented Bush from accepting the invitation from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to join in the unification celebration.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has also been invited.
   Bush discussed the reunification ceremonies in a phone call on
Tuesday with Kohl, Fitzwater said.
   Reading from a prepared statement on behalf of the president,
Fitzwater said, ``The signing in Moscow this morning of the German
unification treaty is a historic event.''
   ``Today's treaty signing makes the dream of a unified, free and
democratic Germany just a short step away.''
   The treaty was signed by the foreign ministers of the United
States, Soviet Union, France and Britain as well as representatives
of the two Germanys. The so-called two-plus-four agreement is the
last major document needed to clear the way for unification.
   ``The successful conclusion of the two-plus four process is a
tribute to the hard work and good faith of all the parties
involved,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Three weeks from today there will be a single Germany,
anchored in the West and participating as a full member of NATO.
President Bush has worked assiduously for the last year to help
guide this process. In the glare of today's Persian Gulf crisis, it
is easy to forget the anxiety and turmoil for East and West during
the unfolding of these events.
   ``But they were successfully managed. And today we can look
forward to a unified Germany that is a partner with its neighbors
and committed to fostering new world order.''
   On a related subject, Fitzwater said that the administration is
still hopeful that a treaty can be signed this year to reduce
conventional arms in Europe, even though progress is slow.
   The reunification of Germany dramatically altered the ground
rules for the treaty, since it means the withdrawal of far more
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe than originally envisioned by
either Moscow or Washington.

   President Bush today taped a ``very
forthright'' message to the Iraqi people, explaining in eight
minutes his reasons for the U.S. military buildup in the Persian
Gulf, aides said.
   Bush stood in front of his desk in the Oval Office for the
taping, which was to be delivered to Iraqi officials for broadcast
on Iraqi television, said Sig Rogich, the president's media adviser.
   ``I'm very pleased with it. He was very forthright,'' Rogich
said after the taping.
   Officials did not release Bush's message, saying the White House
wanted to first give Iraq a chance to air the tape.
   However, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
reiterated his statement that the United States has no quarrel with
the Iraqi people and that their suffering is due to their
president's invasion of Kuwait. Bush said on the tape that ``we
want a peaceful resolution; we want peaceful coexistence with the
people of Iraq,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman, asked if Bush used harsh rhetoric against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, said the message was ``personal and ...
directed toward the people of Iraq.
   Fitzwater said the tape would be delivered to the Iraqi
ambassador, Mohammed al-Mashat, later today by Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger. The White House will give the Iraqi
government five days to broadcast the tape before releasing it to
the U.S. media and to other governments around the world, Fitzwater
said.
   Rogich said that he was putting Arabic subtitles on the tape and
that a simultaneous audio translation would be added.
   Bush made the tape following an announcement by the Iraqi
government last week that it would broadcast a message to the Iraqi
people from Bush, and an offer to send a television crew to
interview him.
   The president chose to make his own videotape rather than submit
to an interview.
   There has been no formal contact between the two governments
about the message, Fitzwater said today.
   ``It was a very straightforward message,'' said Rogich, who also
produced many of Bush's campaign television ads.
   Fitzwater said that Bush worked on the message with officials
from the State Department and National Security Council and that he
also consulted with experts on the Arab world.
   Rogich said Bush read from a TelePrompTer and also read a
quotation from a piece of paper he pulled from his pocket.
   The Iraqi offer was announced after Bush commented that he would
like to have the same access to address the Iraqis as Saddam has
had in getting his message to the American people. Saddam's
interviews and statements have been widely televised, often live,
on U.S. networks.

<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra today passed its
baton to Wolfgang Sawallisch, naming him to the high-profile
position of music director of the venerable orchestra.
   The German-born Sawallisch, 67, was chosen from more than 230
candidates and will succeed Riccardo Muti for the 1993-94 season,
said Theodore A. Burtis, president of the Philadelphia Orchestra
Association.
   Sawallisch has been a guest conductor in Philadelphia on several
occasions and will conduct for two weeks during the current season
and two weeks next season.
   ``I am so pleased that I will be able to continue to make music
with the Philadelphia Orchestra,'' he said in a statement released
at a news conference. ``All of my experiences in Philadelphia since
my debut over 20 years ago have been extremely rewarding.''
   A search committee unanimously recommended Sawallisch, Burtis
said.
   Muti, conducting in Vienna, sent congratulations to Sawallisch.
   ``I know that I will be leaving the orchestra in the hands of a
colleague for whom I have great respect, admiration and
friendship,'' Muti said.
   Sawallisch also is music director and general director of the
Bavarian State Opera in Munich, West Germany.
   Muti, who also is music director of the opera house La Scala in
Milan, Italy, has been associated with the Philadelphia Orchestra
for 20 years, 10 as music director. He said a career on two
continents left him little time for his personal life.
   Sawallisch is the sixth director since Fritz Scheel first stood
on the podium in 1900. Scheel was followed by Carl Pohlig in 1907,
Leopold Stokowski in 1912, Eugene Ormandy in 1936 and Riccardo Muti
in 1980.
   Muti announced last spring that he would not renew his contract
when it runs out next year.
   The orchestra took on world class status under Stokowski's
direction and continued under Ormandy, who, in turn, passed on the
Philadelphia legacy to Muti.

<TEXT>
   Police today detained about 10,000 Hindu
students on their way to a protest rally in the Kashmir Valley,
where a day earlier 21 Moslems were killed in a reported shootout.
   The caravan of buses and trucks that was stopped in Udhampur, 45
miles north of Jammu, was headed toward Srinagar, where the Hindu
activists of the All India Students' Federation had planned to
hoist Indian flags.
   The government, fearing violence, had appealed to the Hindu
activists not to hold their procession to Srinagar, a Moslem
stronghold in Kashmir, the northern sector of Jammu-Kashmir state.
   The students, based in Jammu in a predominantly Hindu sector,
had ignored the official pleas.
   The Hindu students are opposed to a Moslem secessionist movement
that is attempting to get independence for Jammu-Kashmir state, the
only Indian state in which the majority of the population is Moslem.
   The students were arrested without resistance, one official
said, speaking under condition of anonymity. They were expected to
be released after a few hours without charges being pressed.
   In Srinagar, shops were closed and traffic stayed off the roads
today in response to a general strike call given by Moslem
militants.
   The strike was to protest the deaths of 21 Kashmiris Tuesday
during a shoot-out with paramiltary troops near Srinagar.
   The government claimed all the victims, including 17 people in a
bus which exploded and caught fire, were militants. A government
statement said the bus exploded when a stray bullet hit a pile of
ammunition inside it.
   At least 1,175 people have ben killed in Kashmir since January,
when the government started a crackdown on the secessionists.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems. About 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus
while Moslems account for 12 percent.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on campaign finance:
   The latest campaign finance report from the Federal Election
Commission simply reaffirms the steady and deeply disturbing trend
toward electoral domination by political action committees.
   According to the FEC, congressional candidates have received a
total of $93.7 million from PACs during the first 18 months of the
1989-90 election cycle. That represents a 320 percent increase over
the same 18-month period just four years ago.
   As disturbing as the amount of money _ and its accompanying
political influence _ is the fact that 12 times as much PAC money
went to incumbents as to challengers. ...
   Moreover, the $93.7 million in PAC money represents one-third of
the $279 million that congressional candidates will raise and spend
this year. ...
   (T)he two campaign finance reform bills that have passed one
chamber or the other are certainly welcome steps toward lessening
the impact of middlemen _ PACs and other special interests _ in the
elections process. Of the two, the Senate bill is clearly superior.
   (It) would establish much-needed spending limits in conjunction
with partial public funding of congressional campaigns. It would
also ban the acceptance of honoraria, which the House has already
done by rule. To curb the influence of PACs, the Senate bill takes
a two-tier approach: an outright ban on PAC contributions or, if
that were found unconstitutional, an aggregate limit _ equal to 20
percent of the spending limit _ on all PAC giving. ...
   The matter of campaign finance reform should be of concern to
every member of Congress. A recent New York Times-CBS News poll
found that 42 percent of Americans surveyed believed at least half
or more of the members of Congress are financially corrupt.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on poverty:
   The Bush Administration is beginning to look at major revisions
in the way poverty is defined for purposes of federal benefits.
   The current system stems from a crude measure created by a civil
servant in the early 1960s. She took the Agriculture Department's
cheapest recommended food budget and multiplied it by three to
arrive at a poverty line.
   It is unclear whether a redefinition would raise or lower the
numbers of people defined as poor. While it is true that many
people defined as poor and receiving benefits don't seem to receive
nearly enough to make ends meet, the current method may also, in
some cases, actually overstate the extent of poverty.
   On the other hand, some say the current formula sets the poverty
line unrealistically low because it's based on outdated spending
assumptions. While 30 years ago the average American family was
thought to spend a total of three times its food budget to keep
body and soul together, it now spends five times that amount,
largely because of rises in the cost of housing and child care.
   We shall see. For now, though, let us praise the administration
for being willing to open up a hornet's nest to get at something
like the truth. Once that's found, we hope demagoguery from right
and left won't harm efforts to improve programs to help the poor.

   Valley News, Lebanon, N.H., on acid rain:
   After spending 10 years and $537 million, a federal study group
... released a draft of its report on the effects of acid rain. ...
   The report and its reception could prove crucial to the fate of
acid rain legislation.
   The question naturally arises: How can these findings possibly
be used by those who oppose enactment of concrete measures to
reduce emissions responsible for acid rain? The answer lies in the
one thin straw the report offered to those desperate enough to
clutch it. It said that acid rain is a serious problem, but not a
crisis. ...
   Common sense tells us that a serious problem is best addressed

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on the newly-opened Ellis Island
Museum:
   They were astonishing people, these ancestors of yours and ours,
who passed through Ellis Island in the past century on their way to
new lives in America.
   Courage the immigrants possessed above all else. They left home,
family, friends, everything they had known, and cast off aboard
crowded ships for a New World where they believed they would find
the freedom to go as far as their talents and their determination
would allow.
   Husbands left wives and children behind, not knowing how long it
might be before they could earn enough money to send for them. The
wives, when the summons finally came after lonely months and years
of waiting, then made the trip with sons and daughters _ often many
of them _ in tow. Sometimes small children travelled alone to join
parents or other kinfolk. Fear, anxiety and confusion must have
been the travelling companions of them all.
   And, when you can, take a trip to the Ellis Island Immigration
Museum. The visit will give you a renewed appreciation of how much
the idea of America _ and of being Americans _ meant to your
forebears.

   The Sun Herald, Biloxi, Miss., on TV football games:
   The Federal Trade Commission is making a fool of itself by
charging that this country's football fans are not getting a full
selection of college games on television. The FTC's TV antenna must
be broken or its set has been disconnected from the cable.
   Kevin Arquit, FTC Bureau of Competition's director, said he
wants the marketplace to determine what games are shown and when.
That's happening now.
   If anything, television is showing more college football games
to more fans this season than ever before. The arrangement between
the College Football Association, representing 64 schools, and
Capital Cities-ABC, promises to increase the number of televised
games, not reduce it.
   Yet, the CFA deal is what has the FTC in a dither.
   At a time when the nation is faced with $1 billion in costs for
Operation Desert Shield, when congressional budget negotiators are
struggling to find ways to reduce the national deficit by $50
billion in 1991, taxpayers don't need government bureaucrats
wasting time and tax dollars messing up an arrangement that's
giving fans more options of televised college games than they've
ever had before.

   The Times, London, on the Persian Gulf:
   Following the Helsinki summit (between Presidents Bush and
Gorbachev), the (Persian) Gulf confrontation begins what could be
the final diplomatic preliminary to war. ...
   Every shred of evidence suggests that Saddam Hussein was set on
a determined campaign of regional destabilization.
   He would not only have toppled one Gulf state after another,
possibly with the aim of subjugating his old enemy, Iran. He would
also have directed his attention west toward the Levant, where
there are many fuses for him to ignite.
   His declared ambition is to ``liberate'' Jerusalem and there is
no reason to doubt his sincerity. He is plainly without moral
constraint in his regard for international law, common humanity or
the use of the world's most horrible weapons.
   Saddam presents the ``nightmare scenario'' of nuclear@chemical
warfare strategists: of a threat not from a superpower but from a
dictator with nothing to lose. ...
   The United States is the one world power capable of projecting
and paying for a true challenge to this menace.

   This is why we concur with British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd that peaceful means should be sought before resorting to other
options.
   Although no significant headway has been made so far there are
chances that something positive may be achieved in future. ...
   We also maintain that Arab leaders should try to make (Saddam)
Hussein see some sense because what this leader is doing is
certainly not in their interests. He must be made to realize that
in the long run he will have to yield to pressure.
   But before this happens efforts must be made to ensure that the
situation does not degenerate into a physical confrontation. This

   The Straits Times, Singapore, on the Persian Gulf:
   The Gulf crisis ... has entered a wearying phase. Economic
sanctions were decided upon with unprecedented speed and resolve,
but their effects will be slow. President Saddam Hussein is a
ruthless dictator, and as such, has a certain cruel stamina that
comes from being able to make his people endure terrible punishment
in the name of God, Arab glory and country.
   Waiting for sanctions to choke Iraq into submission may not be
enough. Time is on Saddam's side, not the world's.
   The resolve that the world demonstrated early on is slowly but
surely wilting and the horror of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait seems to
have lost much of its shock value.
   With each passing day, the burden of standing up to Iraq mounts.
Defending Saudi Arabia, imposing a naval blockade, stopping trade
with Iraq, and compensating waverers for sticking to sanctions is
expensive all round.
   The United States, in particular, is straining under its
self-appointed and thankless job of world policeman.
   It has not been simply a matter of sending in a couple of handy
carrier groups. As President George Bush has stressed, the
commitment has been more on the scale of planting a complete
medium-sized American town in the Saudi desert.
   It is estimated that the 100,000-strong U.S. military force will
ring up a bill of $2.5 billion ... by the end of this month.
   With each passing day, calls in the West for action against
Saddam become more muted and are being joined by more and louder
discordant voices. With no single obvious solution, politicians and
commentators are pushing their own theories. ....
   With each passing day, despair among Kuwaitis _ and all small,
vulnerable countries _ must also increase.
   Economic sanctions, naval blockades, diplomatic isolation, and a
defensive shield in Saudi Arabia are all very useful. But they do
not look like the most effective weapon against an adversary that
was able to endure eight years of grinding war against Iran without
too much difficulty.
   One thing is certain. As long as the current situation endures,
the international community is in a crisis of principle: Might will
be proved right, and size the master over sovereignty.
   The result at the end of each day that passes with Iraq still in
possession of Kuwait is not a stalemate or a draw.
   It is a victory for Saddam Hussein and the forces of
international terror.

   Tass, Soviet news agency, on Cambodia:
   The Cambodian knot can be untied. This seems obvious after the
decision to form the Supreme National Council, made by the
Cambodian parties at the Jakarta meeting.
   The move signals a breakthrough in the political settlement in
the spirit of national reconciliation.
   This important decision fully attunes with the recommendations
elaborated by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council. They regard the Supreme National Council as an embodiment
of the independence, sovereignty and unity of Cambodia. ...
   The Khmer Rouge ... first balked at supporting (Norodom)
Sihanouk's proposal. According to available information, these
objections have now been lifted, but hardly anyone can forecast how
the Khmer Rouge will behave in future. ...
   A statement made by Sihanouk in Beijing ... introduced a new
element of uncertainty into the situation. Sihanouk, who was to
head the council, said that he was compelled, on health grounds, to
abandon political and diplomatic activity for six months.
   It is important ... to complete the formation of the council and
to make sure that the inter-Khmer dialogue is kept going. ...
   The Soviet Union's proposal to announce a moratorium on military
aid to all Cambodian parties as a component of a comprehensive
settlement is assuming particular importance.
   The organization and holding of free and fair elections under
U.N. auspices in Cambodia and the implementation of measures that
would rule out a return to the policy and practice of the past,
when Pol Pot and his clique perpetrated horrible crimes in the
country, will require enormous efforts.
   Lastly, international guarantees need to be adopted to ensure
the independent and neutral status for Cambodia.

   China's few remaining nomadic herders will be
required to lease fixed plots of pasture, ending their wandering
ways, an official report said Wednesday.
   The English-language China Daily said China plans to lease
millions of acres of grassland to herders, who roam relatively
freely over state-owned pastures.
   The newspaper, quoting Li Shoude, an official from the
Agriculture Ministry, said the new policy will require herdsmen to
contract pasture from the government for a period up to 15 years at
annual rates dependent on grass quality.
   The program is aimed at saving China's grassland from
deterioration due to overgrazing, Li said. He said the herdsmen
would be responsible for keeping up the land they lease and could
renew their leases.
   Li estimated the policy will take more than 10 years to be
implemented nationwide as some herdsmen might find it difficult to
switch from their nomadic lifestyle.
   China's nomadic herders live mainly in the border areas of
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia. The
size of the herding population was not immediately available.

<HEAD>Soviets Running Out of Ink to Print Rubles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer shortages caused by printing too many
rubles are coming home to the Soviet government. It's running out
of ink.
   The national newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Wednesday
that the country is down to just two or three weeks' supply of
printer's ink. ``It's entirely possible that in a short time,
presses for newspapers, passports and rubles will come to a halt,''
the article said.
   The Soviet Union is plagued by shortages, including bread,
cigarettes and recently, five-kopeck coins for the Moscow subway
system. Economists blame the government policy of printing excess
rubles to pay workers more than the value of their production.
   As a result, the ruble is becoming worthless, citizens are
resisting working for nothing, and production is falling. With
fewer exports, the Soviet Union has been unable to pay its foreign
bills on time.
   Asked if the ink shortage meant rubles soon would be
disappearing, Sergei Galkin of the state Printing Committee told
the newspaper, ``Well, maybe that's good?''
   The author agreed, commenting, ``If we judge it logically, why
do we need money? After all, there's nothing to buy.''
   Adding to the embarrassment, the Soviets need dollars to print
more rubles.
   Galkin said Western suppliers of printer's ink have not been
paid for their last shipment and refuse to send any more on credit.
He said he needs $12 million to $17 million before he can replenish
supplies.
   The article was printed under the sardonic headline, ``Marx's
Dream Comes True _ Money is Abolished.'' It referred to Karl Marx's
belief that money would not be needed in a communist society
because everything would be free, and freely available.

suicide.
   Police and friends said the 21-year-old unemployed man tried to

   As doctors were preparing to sedate him, Quinanola slipped away
and ran to a nearby restaurant, where he grabbed a knife and
slashed his wrists, witnesses said.
   Police saw the incident and tried to subdue Quinanola, the
witnesses said. But Quinanola put up such a struggle that officers
shot him, first in the leg and then in the chest. He died a few

   Quinanola's family filed a complaint with the government's Human

<HEAD>IMF Reports U.S. Regained World Trade Leadership in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States regained its leadership in
world trade volume last year with a bigger increase in exports than
any other major industrial country, the International Monetary Fund
said Wednesday.
   But the United States may not hold the lead long against
competition from a united Germany.
   West Germany's share of world trade has held steady, dropping by
only half a percentage point, to 13 percent, since its 1986 peak.
The fund does not report on East Germany, which is not a member.
   After the scheduled Oct. 3 German unification, the numbers will
be combined. Some West German exports may be diverted for a time to
help build up the eastern part of the country, but a united Germany
could take the lead again.
   U.S. traders boosted their exports by 10.5 percent in 1989,
accounting for 13.5 percent of the volume of goods bought and sold
internationally. That does not include oil, which is considered
separately.
   The U.S. share of world trade rose from the 11.5 percent low of
1987, but was still under the 15 percent average of the 1970s,
according to the fund's annual report.
   ``By contrast, the share of Japanese exports in world trade
declined from a peak of 11.5 percent in 1986 to 10 percent in
1989,'' the report said.
   Japan has been under heavy international pressure to improve its
standard of living at home instead of concentrating so heavily on
exports.
   The report was sent to the fund's 151 member governments Aug. 1,
the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. It does not take into account
the invasion or subsequent events.
   The fund's figures dealt with the volume of goods traded, not
their dollar value. They were given only in percentages, not in
actual tons.
   Ups and downs in the price of currencies sometimes distort the
picture when trade is reported in terms of the dollar. In this
case, dollar figures also show the United States back in the lead
for exports in 1989, shipping $363.985 billion worth of goods
compared with West Germany's $341.231 billion worth.
   West Germany held the lead in dollar value of exports from 1986
to 1988.
   The report urged U.S. authorities to resist pressure for
protecting domestic industries against imports and to continue to
lead efforts for freer trade. It also urged a policy of national
and private savings.
   ``An increase in national savings _ achieved mainly through
fiscal restraint _ was, in the board's view, the key to further
reductions in the external deficit,'' the report said.
   The fund report, reflecting the opinions of board members, said
``a majority view held that the Federal Reserve would be well
advised to continue focusing mainly on inflation control since the
abatement of cost and price pressure was not yet fully confirmed.''
   The board said U.S. inflationary pressures had lessened in the
second half of 1989 and that a recession did not appear imminent,
but that lower inflation should be a goal.

   Thomas Cicippio went to mass Wednesday to
pray once again for the release of his youngest brother, who on
that same day finished his fourth year as a hostage in Lebanon.
   The sign in front of the Cicippio house said Joseph Cicippio had
spent 1,460 days in captivity.
   On Thursday, the family planned a quiet observance of Cicippio's
60th birthday. Cicippio was acting controller at American
University in Beirut when he was kidnapped on Sept. 12, 1986.
   Thomas Cicippio said the telephone calls have slowed down and
there aren't many people showing up at the house anymore. But there
are still daily reminders that one of the family is missing.
   Cicippio is one of seven Americans still held by extremists in
Lebanon along with 12 other Westerners.
   Joseph Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, remains in
Beirut, waiting.
   ``It changed all of our lives,'' said Thomas Cicippio, 66, a
retired postal worker. ``Joseph is always on our mind. I don't
wander too far. I'm always waiting for something to break, and I
want to be around when it does.''
   Thirteen months ago, his brother's captors threatened to execute
him in retaliation for Israel's abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric
in southern Lebanon.
   Thomas Cicippio said he speaks with his brother's wife several
times a month and is in occassional contact with the State
Department.
   He also carefully listens to news reports, hoping.
   ``Iran let hostages go even during the Kuwait crisis (and) that
was a good sign for us,'' he said. ``I keep thinking they will be
released tomorrow and tomorrow. I still truly believe our tomorrow
will come.''

   The housing authority director in this ritzy
mountain resort area is resigning because he and his wife cannot
afford the sky-high housing prices.
   ``We would still like to own an American dream,'' said Jim
Adamski, outgoing director of the Aspen-Pitkin County Housing
Authority.
   But with limited space for building and price tags for homes
hovering at $1 million, that's difficult on a $46,500 salary, said
Adamski, who has been living in nearby Carbondale, a 45-minute
commute.
   Adamski is going to be housing director in Yakima, Wash., where
he said he's been looking at a four-bedroom house with a two-car
garage and circle driveway in ``a nice part of town,'' for $98,000.
   In Aspen, $186,500 will buy a three-bedroom house in a
subsidized employee housing project under construction _ if one is
lucky enough to win a lottery to be allowed to buy it.
   Sixty-four families are trying for one of 13 single-family
houses in the project.
   Adamski said he's also fed up with the politics of housing in
Aspen, charging that politicians campaign on the issue but don't
get nails banged after the ballots are counted.
   ``Housing is a basic human need,'' he said. ``It should not be a
political issue.''

   The children of northeast Saudi
Arabia this week became one of the biggest obstacles to press
coverage of the American military buildup in the region.
   The U.S. military has been using rented buses to take groups of
reporters on organized tours of various military camps and
installations. The most popular atractions have been guided tours
of an air base where many newly arrived soldiers take their first
steps in Saudi Arabia.
   But the military lost most of its buses Tuesday when the Dhahran
Academy opened the school year. While the kids were heading back to
school, a lot of reporters were sitting around a hotel.
   ``We better figure this one out soon because I'm already tired
of looking at this group,'' one military spokesman said just hours
after the buses were surrendered.

   For most American military personnel, Saudi Arabia is a new
experience, requiring a number of cultural adjustments. Not for Air
Force Col. John Miller.
   When Miller arrived last month it was his 15th trip to Saudi
Arabia. He supervises maintenance for U.S. AWACS planes and had
several stints here in the early 1980s when Americans were training
the Saudis to fly the airborne radar stations.
   ``We parked on our old ramp,'' Miller, a 46-year-old native of
Crestview, Fla., said in describing his flight to his latest
deployment at a Saudi airbase. ``I got my old office. I got my old
couch.''
   Miller said he expected to be in these familiar surroundings for
awhile.
   ``I'm in here for the long haul,'' he said during an interview
Saturday. ``I didn't hurry and leave my shaving kit.''

   The heat, boredom and uncertainty at times take their toll on
the morale of U.S. military personnel. But it seems every unit here
has had some special delivery from the states that has picked up
morale at just the right moment.
   For Air Force Capt. Michael Hatcher of Front Royal, Va., that
moment came last week when the AWACS unit in which he is a pilot
received several packages of cookies from schoolchildren from three
Maryland towns outside Washington.
   Hatcher was half asleep when a reporter sat down next to him
during an overnight AWACS mission Saturday, but he roused himself
long enough to offer a note with the childrens' names and a request
that they somehow be thanked for their gesture.
   ``It means a lot to us,'' he said of the cookie shipment, which
provided dessert for the 30-member crew on the flight. ``You
realize that someone else in the world cares about you. It was a
real nice surprise.''
   The cookies, he said, came from Maura O'Rourke of Bethesda, Md.;
Mark Fedders of nearby North Potomac; and Laura and Colleen McAdam
of Rockville.

   American football came to Saudi Arabia on Sunday, via Armed
Forces Radio and Television. Several Saudis joined Americans around
a television set connected by cable to the military station for a
season-opening game between the Green Bay Packers and the Los
Angeles Rams.
   The Saudis had the language down pat, but with the exception of
a Washington embassy staffer _ a Redskins fan _ they have developed
no team loyalties.
   ``Blitz, sack, great play,'' one of the Saudis said in calling
the action as Green Bay sacked Rams quarterback Jim Everett.
   But the same Saudi was cheering when Everett threw a long
touchdown pass a few plays later, prompting the embassy official to
ask, ``Who are you rooting for anyway?''
   The other Saudi simply shrugged and said: ``What do I care,
whoever has the ball.''

<HEAD>Government Declares Unilateral Halt to Action Against Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday halted
offensive actions against Communist rebels in Manila and three
northern provinces but demanded a show of sincerity from rebels
before the cease-fire is expanded.
   There was no immediate reaction from guerrillas. If they agree
to a cease-fire, it would be the most extensive truce between
rebels and government since a 60-day truce in December 1986.
   The government move is widely seen as an attempt to stop
fighting so that the government can concentrate on rehabilitating
areas devastated by the July 16 earthquake.
   Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon, a member of the Cabinet
security committee, said the truce would cover the Manila area and
the provinces of Benguet, Mountain Province and Nueva Vizcaya,
which were badly damaged by the quake.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said rebels must prove their
sincerity in wanting peace before it can be expanded to other areas
of the country.
   President Corazon Aquino said she called the cease-fire in
response to calls for peace in the Philippines. She did not say how
long it would last.
   ``In response to the people's call for a genuine peace, I have
directed the armed forces of the Philippines to maintain the
suspension of offensive military operations in the
earthquake-affected areas and the National Capital Region,'' Mrs.
Aquino said.
   The statement avoided the word ``cease-fire.'' Deputy Press
Secretary Horacio Paredes said the military was ``allergic'' to the
word.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, who proposed the move, said insurgents can
still be arrested, but soldiers will not conduct patrols in known
rebel strongholds to avoid shootouts with guerrillas. The move also
does not apply to military rebels who have threatened new attacks.
   Last week, the rebel umbrella National Democratic Front said a
cease-fire would be ineffective unless the government offered ways
to solve the nation's problems, including poverty, repression and
the presence of U.S. military bases. The rebels oppose the U.S.
presence in the Philippines.
   The military has objected to the word ``cease-fire'' because it
feels the term gives belligerency status to the insurgents. The
military believes the nationwide cease-fire declared in 1986
enabled rebels to regroup and retrain.
   Last July, rebels declared a limited cease-fire in
quake-devastated areas but the government did not respond.
   Meanwhile, guerrillas killed two militiamen in a pre-dawn
assault Wednesday on a military checkpoint in the town of
Catbalogan on central Samar island.
   Almost simultaneously, two rebels on a motorcycle lobbed a
grenade at the town's police headquarters, wounding two policemen.
Samar, a rebel stronghold, is not covered by the truce.

   Nine people convicted of murder or robbery were
executed as part of an anti-crime crackdown that has resulted in
hundreds of convicts being put to death, a report said.
   Shanghai's Intermediate People's Court ordered the death
penalties, and the executions were carried out from Friday to
Monday, according to Shanghai's Liberation Daily newspaper Tuesday.
The report gave details of the crimes of only two convicts.
   One man with a criminal record was charged with forcing 15 women
from Shanghai into prostitution. The other, a peasant from eastern
Anhui province, stole about $1,063 from a sleeping villager and
then killed the villager.
   Executions in China are usually carried out immediately after
sentencing with a bullet to the back of the head.
   China's media do not report all executions. It is estimated that
more than 1,000 convicted criminals are executed every year.

   For the second time in two weeks, scientists
report cloning a gene of a brain communication system that may shed
light on treating schizophrenia and other brain disorders.
   The gene tells brain cells how to make a dopamine receptor, a
structure that a brain cell uses to receive a chemical messenger
called dopamine from other brain cells.
   The newly cloned gene is for a type of dopamine receptor called
D3. Last week, other scientists announced the cloning of the gene
for D1. The gene for D2 was cloned in 1988.
   The new work, by scientists in Paris, is reported in Thursday's
issue of the British journal Nature.
   Dopamine receptors are sites of action for drugs used in
treating schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, a potentially
disabling condition that can include a tremor, rigidity and gradual
loss of spontaneous movement.
   The new cloning may lead to ``powerful new strategies'' for
developing safer and more effective drugs to treat psychosis, the
loss of touch with reality seen in schizophrenia, Solomon Snyder of
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore
commented in a Nature editorial.
   The finding also may help shed light on Parkinson's, said
Olivier Civelli, one of the researchers who announced cloning of
the D1 gene last week.
   Scientists eventually may uncover five or even 10 types of
dopamine receptor, said Civelli, of the Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland.

<TEXT>
   A Senate committee today overwhelmingly
approved a five-year extension of the beleaguered National
Endowment for the Arts and proposed recouping federal funds from
any grant recipient convicted of violating obscenity or child
pornography laws.
   The 15-1 vote by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
sent the bipartisan compromise to the Senate floor for action.
Similar legislation in the House has bogged down in bitter
wrangling over NEA support for works that some critics consider
obscene or blasphemous.
   The Senate bill, which supports the White House request for $175
million for the federal arts agency next year, was supported by
committee liberals and conservatives on both sides of the NEA
controversy.
   Arts supporters said the bill's support by such figures as Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee's liberal chairman, and
Orrin Hatch of Utah, its ranking Republican and a staunch
conservative, would heighten the bill's chances for passage by the
full Senate.
   Before it approved the compromise, the panel rejected on a 14-2
vote a proposal by Sen. Dan Coates, R-Ind., to impose
anti-obscenity guidelines on NEA panels that select grant
applications for approval. Coates was backed by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., who then voted in favor of the committee
compromise.
   Hatch said the bill would take the arts endowment out of the
business of judging which artistic and literary works might be
obscene, and leave those questions for the courts to decide.
   The compromise would require the NEA to recover grant money from
any recipient convicted of using federal funds to produce works
that violate obscenity or child pornography laws.
   The guilty artists would be banned from receiving NEA grants for
three years or until the funds are repaid, whichever is longer.
   Coates, the lone dissenter on the final vote, said the arts
endowment's very existence will be jeopardized unless Congress
takes stronger steps to halt federal subsidies for what he called
the ``filth'' and ``garbage'' that is ``profoundly offensive to the
majority of the American people.''
   His proposal would have required NEA panels to reject grants for
works that violate the Supreme Court's obscenity standards, portray
sexual exploitation of children or attack historic religious
figures, principles or symbols.
   The endowment has been buffeted for the past 18 months by
criticism of its past support for controversial exhibitions of
works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres
Serrano, which conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists
have denounced as obscene and sacrilegious.
   The NEA's statutory authority will expire Sept. 30. Also
expiring on that date will be a congressional ban on NEA support
for works that ``may be considered obscene.'' The ban was attached
to the NEA's current $171 million budget last fall at the urging of
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Meanwhile, a bipartisan commission's plea for Congress to omit
anti-obscenity restrictions on the NEA in its reauthorization
legislation drew cheers from liberal activists and boos from
conservative lawmakers.
   The 12-member study panel said Tuesday that it unanimously
opposed any new legislative curbs on the content of works financed
by NEA grants.
   ``Content restrictions may raise serious constitutional issues,
would be inherently ambiguous and would almost certainly involve
the endowment and the Department of Justice in costly and
unproductive lawsuits,'' it said.
   The commission, established by Congress last fall to examine NEA
operations amid the obscenity furor, also suggested that NEA
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer scrap a requirement that all grant
recipients sign an anti-obscenity pledge.
   Both proposals were applauded by the liberal People for the
American Way Action Fund, which called them ``an utter repudiation
of the proposals of the NEA's attackers.''
   The commission's report drew a mixed response from Rep. E.
Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., a leader in House negotiations over a
compromise bill to extend the endowment's life.
   Coleman welcomed the report as a possible framework for a
compromise, but he made clear that ``it's not enough for most
members to accept.''
   He predicted that the House will ignore the commission's appeal
and ultimately approve some form of anti-obscenity curbs on NEA
grants. Coleman also deplored the panel's rejection of his proposal
to shift as much as 60 percent of federal grant money to the
control of state arts agencies.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a vocal conservative critic of
the NEA, dismissed the commission's report. He said the panel was
created to provide ``political cover'' for NEA supporters who are
fighting legislative restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for
federal grants.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Economic War Against Drug Cartels A Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general said in statements
published Wednesday that the government's financial war against
billionaire cocaine cartels has been a failure.
   Speaking to Congress on Tuesday, Attorney General Alfonso Gomez
Mendez said the government's campaign to seize drug wealth ``has
been a failure because it has represented more costs to the nation
than benefits for the community.''
   Gomez's statements were published in major Bogota newspapers.
   Since beginning an anti-drug crackdown in August 1989, the
government has seized about 670 real estate properties allegedly
belonging to drug traffickers. Among the seizures are hotels, night
clubs, luxury homes, ranches, 23 clandestine airports, 365 cars and
68 airplanes, according to government figures.
   Gomez said the goods, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions
of dollars, were taken by the state ``without being judicially and
technically prepared to administer them.''
   He warned that innefficient bureaucracy may force the government
to return many of the properties.
   Gomez added that the confiscations have generated corruption in
the judicial branch because many judges have returned properties
under suspicious circumstances. About 40 Colombian judges are now
being investigated for possible abuses.
   Other officials are being investigatied for alleged embezzlement
of drug traffickers' goods.
   Gomez said police and army costs for maintaining the goods are
too high. He said 16,000 security officers are needed to guard them.
   President Cesar Gaviria has said Colombia's drug war cost the
country $1 billion in the last year.
   Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, began the crackdown in
August 1989 after the Medellin cocaine cartel was blamed for
murdering a presidential candidate.

least eight of the stolen works are copies of paintings by Pablo
Picasso, Pierre Auguste Renoir and other 19th- and 20th-century
artists.
   But the thieves last week left behind an original work by
Camille Pissaro that probably was worth more than all the stolen
items together, police said.
   The man who owns the burgled apartment and the paintings told
police Tuesday of their true value.
   Schwarz-Fuchs sginal pieces by lesser-known
artists also were stolen, but they not of great value.

   When the call came from the White House,
the Merritt family thought they were being taken for a ride.
   The caller said President Bush, in his nationally broadcast
address to Congress on Tuesday night, wanted to single out Army
Pfc. Wade Merritt of Knoxville. He wrote to his parents of his
pride in serving in Saudi Arabia, but also stated, ``I don't
believe in war . . . .''
   ``We thought it was a hoax, you know,'' said Merritt's sister
Kim Inklebarger. ``We're big jokers. It really didn't get real
until President Bush said it. Once he actually said it, it was very
incredibly real.''
   Bush ended the family's suspense when he read an excerpt of a
2{-page letter Merritt wrote several weeks ago from Saudi Arabia to
his parents, Ann and Kenneth Merritt. Mrs. Merritt, who Ms.
Inklebarger said is ``extremely patriotic,'' had sent the White
House a copy of the letter.
   Wade Merritt told ABC's Good Morning America today that some of
his mother's friends had encouraged her to send his letter to the
president.
   But he added, ``I was very shocked.''
   ``I am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane
aggression,'' the 22-year-old soldier wrote. ``I am proud of my
Army and its men. ... I am proud to serve my country.''
   The soldier also wrote, in a section not read by the president,
``As much as I love my job, I don't believe in war or the
unnecessary acts of violence against fellow human beings, but it is
my job.
   ``When I made a decision to make the Army my career, I knew that
this day would come, but I was hoping it wouldn't.''
   In his speech, Bush vowed that Iraq would not prevail in its
Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait, and said, ``Let me just say, Wade,
America is proud of you. And grateful to every soldier, sailor,
Marine and airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf.''
   Family members videotaped the speech.
   Merritt serves in the 124th Military Intelligence Battalion
based at Fort Stewart, Ga., and had been scheduled to come home for
a week's leave when the Mideast crisis erupted.
   After sending the letter to the White House, Mrs. Merritt got a
response Sept. 4.
   ``It's a beautiful letter,'' she said. ``The president was very
proud.''

   A bank controlled by Republican gubernatorial
candidate Clayton Williams may have violated state and federal
consumer protection laws in financing hundreds of new cars in
Houston, a newspaper reported today.
   The Houston Chronicle said many of the car buyers _ generally
poor credit risks _ complain they were forced to purchase unwanted
and unnecessary insurance through ClayDesta National Bank of
Midland as a condition of getting the loans.
   In addition to the price of the car, most buyers said, the loans
financed insurance policies, typically ranging from $1,000 to
$7,000, that would cover payments in case of illness or death.
   ClayDesta President David N. Jones denied any wrongdoing and
said the insurance was simply an option.
   Jones said he doesn't believe any laws were violated in the loan
transactions. But he said he had little control or knowledge of
what the customers were told by employees of dealerships where
borrowers signed for loans.
   There was no immediate comment from Williams, a controlling
partner in the bank. His spokesman Gorden Hensley said today,
``There is nothing improper here.'' Hensley referred all questions
about the story to Jones, who said it was ``riddled with
inaccuracies.''
   ``ClayDesta Bank has never required insurance to be purchased
through us as a requirement for a loan,'' Jones said. ``I am upset.
I'm upset any time the bank and its policies are misrepresented. We
always have managed our business with honesty and integrity and I'm
upset when that comes into question.''
   According to documents obtained by the Chronicle, ClayDesta made
more than 400 car loans _ at 18 percent interest _ in the Houston
area between June 1989 and February 1990.
   Texas Assistant Attorney General Clyde Farrell said if insurance
was required as a condition of the loans, it must be included as
part of the finance charge and calculated into the interest rate.
Some of the loan agreements obtained by the Chronicle, however, did
not fulfill that requirement, the newspaper said.
   One purchaser, Noelia Rodriguez, said she and her husband were
told they had to buy the bank-provided insurance when they financed
a new pickup last December.
   Another Houston purchaser, Gladys Dickerson, said more than
$1,000 in insurance premiums was included in her loan agreement.
   ``I thought it was mandatory,'' she said.
   Jones said that although loan papers were drawn up with the
insurance costs included by bank personnel, buyers could decline
the insurance and the papers would be redrawn.

   Gov. Rudy Perpich boasted that his
Democratic-Farmer Labor Party had reclaimed Minnesota's political
middle ground after he turned back a tough primary challenge to win
nomination to a fourth term.
   Perpich defeated his former commerce commissioner, Mike Hatch,
on Tuesday to bound into a general election race against political
newcomer Jon Grunseth, the winner in a six-way
Independent-Republican primary.
   Among the losers in the GOP race was state Auditor Arne Carlson,
a moderate who had been endorsed by the state's largest teachers'
union.
   ``Now that Arne Carlson's not in the race, we have the center
back,'' Perpich told supporters in a victory speech.
   Minnesota's other Rudy _ U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz _ breezed past
token opposition in the Republican primary. He stepped into a
general election campaign against Carleton College political
science professor Paul Wellstone, the winner of a Democratic race
against state Agriculture Commissioner Jim Nichols.
   With 81 percent of the state's precincts reporting in the
governor's race, Perpich had 161,065 votes to Hatch's 123,830 _ a
56-42 percent margin. Kent Herschbach had the remaining 2 percent.
   Perpich, 62, has served 10 years as governor, longer than anyone
in Minnesota's history. But his re-election bid had appeared doomed
earlier this year.
   Hatch, 41, criticized Perpich for having been in office too
long. The two also disagreed on access to abortion, which Perpich
opposes and Hatch supports.
   Still, in his concession speech, Hatch promised to back the
governor in the general election. ``I support Rudy Perpich in his
efforts and will do my best to see that he is re-elected,'' he said.
   On the GOP side, Grunseth captured 127,349 votes, or 50 percent,
to Carlson's 82,087, or 32 percent. Former federal prosecutor Doug
Kelley had 17 percent and Beatrice Mooney, Mary Jane Rachner and
Samuel A. Faulk split the remainder.
   Grunseth, a St. Paul businessman, had attacked Carlson for being
too liberal; among other things, he supports a woman's right to an
abortion and Grunseth opposes it.
   ``The abortion issue played awfully, awfully big _ much bigger
than anybody expected,'' Carlson said.
   In the GOP Senate race, Boschwitz trounced John Zeleniak by an
87-13 percent margin. In the Democratic race, Wellstone, a member
of the Democratic National Committee, claimed 60 percent to
Nichols' 35 percent. Gene Schenk had 5 percent.

   Iran's spiritual leader called today for ``holy war'' against
the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf in another sign that Tehran
was moving to mend fences with Iraq.
   In Washington, President Bush reaffirmed the U.S. commmitment to
force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to relinquish Kuwait.
   Bush said his heart went out to the families of the hundreds of
Americans held hostage by Iraq, but he declared, ``America and the
world will not be blackmailed.''
   ``Let no one doubt our staying power. We will stand by our
friends,'' Bush told a joint session of Congress Tuesday night.
   More than 400 Americans and Britons who had been stranded in
Kuwait, meanwhile, took off Wednesday from Baghdad, ending a
six-week ordeal. Their Boeing 747 was chartered jointly by the
United States and Britain.
   Also today, President Bush taped a message aimed at the Iraqi
public explaining why most of the world stands united against
Iraq's conquest of Kuwait. White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater expressed doubt Iraq would actually show the full
unedited tape.
   Facing Iraq's estimated 260,000 troops in and around Kuwait are
more than 150,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region, hundreds
of warplanes and a multinational flotilla enforcing a U.N. embargo.
   In Iran, which has said it endorsed the embargo, official anger
at the U.S. presence in the Middle East seemed to be overshadowing
opposition to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The struggle against American aggression, greed, plans and
policies in the Persian Gulf will be counted as Jihad (holy war),
and anybody who is killed on that path is a martyr,'' declared
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, in a radio
broadcast monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   ``Moslem nations will not allow America to set up its security
and defense system in the region,'' Khamenei said.
   Iran on Tuesday reportedly agreed to give Iraq food and medicine
in exchange for cash and up to 200,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to a source in Tehran, who spoke on condition of
anonymity,
   There has been no official comment on the accord or on
discussions Sunday between Iranian officials and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz, the first senior Iraqi official to visit Iran
in 15 years. The two nations waged an eight-year war that ended in
1988.
   Saddam on Monday offered free oil to developing nations, if they
would send their own tankers to get it. But at least publicly,
there appeared to be no takers.
   In Moscow, a Russian parliamentary committee called today for
the suspension of a Soviet treaty of friendship with Iraq and the
immediate withdrawal of Soviet military specialists, even though it
could endanger 5,800 Soviet citizens still in that country.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told the Soviet
parliament that the military men would leave as their contracts
end. He said the government was worried about what might happen to
the Soviet citizens if the advisers are pulled out right away.
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, one of
Saddam's few strong Mideast backers since the invasion of Kuwait,
arrived in Amman, Jordan today for talks with King Hussein on the
crisis.
   At the United Nations in New York, a committee looked for a way
to allow food to be delivered to the hundreds of thousands of
foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait without breaking the embargo.
   ``The Iraqi authorities have refused to deliver foodstuffs,''
Marjatta Rasi, the Finnish ambassador who chairs the sanctions
committee, said Tuesday.
   ``I don't think that the Iraqi government is willing to take the
responsibility of the starvation of thousands and thousands of
third-state nationals,'' she said.
   The U.N. embargo has cut off virtually all trade but could
permit humanitarian shipments. A U.N. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said today the committee was ``deadlocked.''
   The United States is trying to push through a statement laying
down general guidelines for providing food, while developing
nations want a simple resolution allowing India to send a ship
loaded with 11,000 tons of food for its nationals.
   The ship was sitting in port while 140,000 Indians risked
starvation, said India's U.N. ambassador, C.R. Gharekhanhe.
   The Philippines has also appealed for permission to send food to
about 5,000 Filipinos stranded in Kuwait.
   The five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ on Tuesday presented a
plan for letting food into Iraq and Kuwait.
   Under the U.S.-sponsored plan, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar would send a team to check conditions in Iraq and Kuwait to
see if emergency food is needed, said a Western diplomat who spoke
on condition of anonymity. But Iraq has so far declined to grant
permission to a top U.N. official in Baghdad, Kofi Annan, to travel
to Kuwait to investigate.
   A U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said Tuesday that up to 800 more
Americans and Britons will fly out of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait this
week, most of them women and children leaving their husbands behind.
   Saddam has said he is keeping foreign men as human shields.
   The State Department said Iraq had told U.S. officials that
American men residing in Iraq and Kuwait who were born in Arab
countries will be allowed to leave. Iraq generally has not let
American men leave.
   Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad traveled today to
Turkey and planned a later stop in Saudi Arabia for talks aimed at
speeding the repatriation of thousands of Bangladeshis stranded
after fleeing Iraq and Kuwait.
   In Iraq today, lawyers continued work on an indictment charging
Bush with a variety of human rights violations ``against the Arab
people,'' the Iraqi News Agency reported. The trial could begin in
October, the agency reported.
   The idea of trying Bush was announced shortly after Western
officials suggested Saddam might be tried for crimes against
humanity for the use of chemical weapons in 1988 against Iraq's
minority Kurdish population.
   In Cairo, Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency said today
that a coup to oust Saddam was increasingly likely.
   Without citing its sources, the agency quoted recent reports
that a number of officers from Saddam's elite Republican Guard were
executed recently _ indicating problems of loyalty _ and said
anti-Saddam leaflets were circulating in Iraqi cities.

   The United States sent troops, guns and tanks
to Saudi Arabia; the USO is sending in the clowns.
   Steve Martin and Jay Leno have been booked and other big-name
talent is being wooed to entertain the more than 100,000 American
troops deployed in the area.
   Bob Hope, who's made a practice of bringing laughter to U.S.
troops since World War II, may swap deserts and go from his Palm
Springs, Calif., home to Saudi Arabia for one of his famed
Christmas shows.
   ``If he's called, he'll go,'' said an aide to the 87-year-old
Hope.
   Martin is scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia next month,
accompanied by his wife, actress Victoria Tennant.
   The couple will meet with soldiers at the main U.S. airbase in
the northeastern Saudi city of Dharan, where most Americans are
stationed, and in remote posts around Saudi Arabia.
   Martin, the stand-up comic turned actor, won't stage a show,
preferring to spend his time in impromptu sessions with the troops.
   ``Just the fact that he is coming to see soldiers in their
tents, bunkers, is a very important message that people care about
them,'' said Kevin McCarthy, executive producer of USO _ United
Service Organization.
   ``If anyone can make these men and women forget about the heat
and pressure for a few hours, it's this wild and crazy guy,''
McCarthy said.
   Leno has been lined up for two Thanksgiving shows, and other
performers will be announced as their tours are finalized.
   The Dallas Cowboys' cheerleaders _ regulars on the USO circuit
in recent years _ probably won't wave their pompons for the troops
because such a show wouldn't sit well with the Saudi hosts.
   In keeping with strict Moslem law, Saudi women are hidden behind
veils and robes, limited in their movements and prevented from
associating with men who aren't their relatives.
   ``We will have to have special sensitivities for the cultural
and religious differences,'' McCarthy said, adding that the USO
will consult with the State and Defense Departments about what's
acceptable by Saudi standards.
   ``There's nothing wrong with a clean, wholesome dance show. But
our role is entertainment, not just pretty girls,'' McCarthy said.
   However, he said, entertainers will have more leeway aboard the
dozens of U.S. warships in the region.
   The USO's morale building is getting off to a slow start because
priority has been given to the massive task of moving the troops
and their equipment to the region.
   ``We would have liked to be in there earlier,'' McCarthy said.
``But we also don't want to get in the way.''
   Martin, Leno and the others are donating their time. USO will
pay for the productions out of a $2 million Gulf Crisis Fund
established with corporate gifts since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The USO also is setting up centers in Egypt, Turkey, Saudi
Arabia and other locations to provide troops with currency
exchange, phones, televisions, movies and other off-duty comforts.
   The operation also will be funded by private donations and $3
calls to a 1-900 number where callers may leave messages for the
troops.

<HEAD>GOP Heaves Sigh of Relief in Arizona; Sees `Great Chance' in
Minnesota</HEAD>

   GOP leaders heaved a sigh of relief Wednesday after Evan
Mecham's defeat in Arizona and hailed Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich's
victory in a hotly contested Democratic primary as offering ``a
great chance'' to capture that office.
   Abortion opponents celebrated the latest election results while
conceding they were ``very mixed.''
   The results of Tuesday's 11 primaries offered a little bit for
many to celebrate.
   In Arizona's Republican gubernatorial primary, J. Fife Symington
beat Mecham, whose term as governor ended 2{ years ago with his
impeachment conviction.
   ``We nominated our strongest candidate,'' said Charles Black,
the principal Republican Party spokesman in the absence of GOP
chairman Lee Atwater, who is battling a brain tumor.
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown also professed delight
with the primary results.
   ``I wish the general election was tomorrow,'' said Brown who
contended that the lineup of Democratic candidates in the 36 races
for governor this year was ``almost too good to be true.''
   Tuesday's primaries left only a few states that haven't
completed the lineup for the November elections. Next week, voters
in Massachusetts, Washington and Oklahoma will settle contests.
   The customary professions of unity were heard across the primary
states the day after the votes were counted.
   Perpich's primary opponent, Mike Hatch said he would work for
the governor's re-election. But Mecham offered Symington an
endorsement with a difference.
   The former governor said he would back the millionaire developer
because he would be better than Democratic nominee Terry Goddard.
   ``Goddard will be a 100 percent disaster,'' said Mecham. ``Fife
will only be an 80 percent disaster.''
   Despite the latest primary results, Brown insisted that support
of abortion was ``playing very positively for Democratic
candidates.'' He conceded there were some exceptions, including
Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Kansas, where the Democratic nominees
for governor were firmly anti-abortion.
   ``In a close contest, I think it can make a difference,'' said
Brown.
   Speaking for a party that is trying to move away from hard-line
opposition to abortion, the GOP's Black said, ``There are very few
races where abortion is a big issue.''
   ``In Minnesota, the fact that Governor Perpich was renominated
gives us a great chance to win the governorship,'' said Black.
   But Perpich, ridiculed by critics as ``Governor Goofy'' looked
as tough as a Minnesota winter as he defeated Hatch by 56 percent
to 42 percent after a campaign that once looked like a dead heat.
Businessman Jon Grunseth won the GOP nomination for governor in a
primary in which his anti-abortion views were called a major factor.
   ``The abortion issue played awfully, awfully big _ much bigger
than anybody expected,'' said the GOP loser, state auditor Arne
Carlson, who was attacked for his pro-choice views.
   A similar contrast existed in the Democratic race, with Perpich
opposed to abortion and Hatch pro-choice.
   Anti-abortion activists also hailed the primary victory by
Maryland congressman Roy Dyson over three challengers, including
state legislator Barbara Kreamer, who was endorsed by the National
Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL).
   But elsewhere in Maryland, three legislators who led a state
Senate filibuster against pro-choice legislation were defeated by
abortion rights advocates.
   ``The results are very mixed,'' said Nancy Myers of the National
Right to Life Committee. ``We are thrilled with the results in
Minnesota. We basically cleaned their clock. ... In Maryland, we
lost the Senate races but we kept Dyson.''
   In New Hampshire, Democratic Senate nominee, John Durkin,
promised to make abortion an issue in his campaign against the
GOP's Rep. Bob Smith in the race for the Senate seat being vacated
by Republican Gordon Humphrey. Durkin, who served one six-year term
in the Senate in the 1970s is pro-choice; Smith is anti-abortion.
   Leaving Washington after two Senate terms, Humphrey immediately
sought a seat in the New Hampshire Senate and defeated state Rep.
Jack Sherburne in a primary in which abortion was an issue.
   ``There's no one we'd rather beat than Gordon Humphrey,'' said
Peg Dobbie, executive director of NARAL. Despite NARAL's efforts,
Humphrey captured 58 percent of the primary vote.
   In the Arizona primary campaign, Symington said he would support
unlimited access to abortion during the first three months of
pregnancy and would oppose a total ban on abortion. Democratic
nominee Goddard campaigned as a supporter of abortion rights.
   In the District of Columbia, Sharon Pratt Dixon scored a
surprise victory in a five-way race for the Democratic nomination
for mayor and received congratulations from the current mayor,
Marion Barry, who decided not to seek a fourth term after he was
indicted on cocaine posesssion and perjury charges.
   ``I feel some relief that this is over now,'' said Barry.
``Obviously, the voters wanted some major changes.''

   Two Greenpeace protesters chained themselves to
the rudder of the Exxon Mediterranean today but were quickly
removed as the tanker formerly called the Exxon Valdez returned to
service.
   Several Greenpeace boats hovered near the dock where the Exxon
Mediterranean was scheduled to depart after dawn today, said Exxon
spokesman Les Rogers in Houston. The time was pushed back several
hours because of the incident, Rogers said.
   The tanker left a pier at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co.
shortly before 10 a.m., but was further delayed by fog in San Diego
Bay as tug boats, Harbor Police boats and Coast Guard vessels
hovered nearby.
   Nine Greenpeace protesters were arrested and were being cited
for suspicion of trespassing and disturbing the peace, said Harbor
Police Chief Arthur LeBlanc. He said they would be released after
being processed.
   Company officials said the ship was undamaged and they hoped it
would leaving San Diego without further disruption.
   Before it was renamed, the Exxon Valdez caused the worst oil
spill in U.S. history when it ran aground in Alaska's Prince
William Sound on March 24, 1989. It spilled almost 11 million
gallons of crude, killing scores of animals and fouling hundreds of
miles of coastline.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Dori Smith said that at about 4:30 a.m.
two members of the group used suction cups to climb to the ship's
rudder and fastened themselves to it with a metal chain.
   Police Sgt. David Rohowits said that shortly after 6 a.m., a
Harbor Police diver used bolt cutters to get the two protesters off
the rudder. Officers arrested them and a third protester in a
rubber raft trying to put a Greenpeace sign on the ship, Rohowits
said.
   ``Our goal was to attempt to prevent or delay departure of the
ship and we hope we have been able to delay them so they would miss
the morning tide,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Bill Walker. ``We
think we have been partially successful.''
   The ship is scheduled to go to Singapore for refueling before
heading to the Mediterranean, where Exxon officials say it will
haul crude from Middle East countries to European ports.
   Repairs on the 32,000-ton tanker, the largest in Exxon's 13-ship
fleet, began in August 1989 and ended in July. Workers replaced
one-third of its hull, which was mangled by the grounding, with
3,000 tons of new, inch-thick steel. Repair costs totaled $30
million.
   The tanker can hold nearly 1.4 million barrels of crude. A
barrel is 42 gallons.
   The ship was renamed the Mediterranean in July. Exxon officials
denied that its renaming and relocation were related to last year's
spill, and said it is company policy to name tankers according to
the areas they serve.

more than one mile underground killed 19 workers and injured 22 on
Wednesday, company officials said.
   Anglo-American Corp., the world's largest gold mining company,
said an investigation was under way into the cause of the blast at
the Vaal Reefs mine, 100 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
   No details were immediately available.
   South Africa has the deepest gold mines in the world and several
hundred workers are killed annually in underground accidents.

   The second typhoon to lash China's southeast
coast this month caused at least 74 deaths and about $225 million
damage, but both figures are expected to rise, an official report
said Wednesday.
   Electricity and water remained out to about 90 percent of homes
and businesses in the coastal city of Fuzhou, about 1,000 miles
south of Beijing, the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily
said. The city was in one of the areas hardest hit by Typhoon Dot
on Saturday.
   The report estimated more than 1 million people were stranded by
flooding.
   The rain washed away 27 bridges and destroyed roads at 127
locations, the report said. About 45,000 houses collapsed and 5.3
million acres of farmland were damaged, it said.
   Before hitting China, Dot cause at least seven deaths and
widespread damage to the Philippines and Taiwan with winds up to
105 mph.
   Typhoon Abe hit China's southeast coast earlier this month,
killing more than 100 people.

<BYLINE>Woman Finds New Sense of Patriotism After Mideast Ordeal
^By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suzette Woodruff says patriotism wasn't a big
deal in her young life _ until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent
her scrambling in an escape that was assisted by the royal families
of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   She found herself joining six companions in an emotional
rendition of ``God Bless America'' when their plane touched down in
New York City.
   ``I really did want to get down and kiss the ground,'' the
21-year-old Las Vegas woman said Tuesday. ``When you get away from
this country, when you see what we saw, you really take pride in
America.''
   Woodruff returned home Saturday. Family members were waiting for
her with streamers and small American flags.
   ``I was never so thankful to see an American flag,'' she said.
   Earlier this year, Woodruff got a part as a dancer with a group
of entertainers going to the Middle East.
   The group, including singers and dancers, performed three months
at a hotel in Bahrain.
   At the end of their engagement they were invited to Kuwait by a
member of the royal family who was a friend of the group's leader,
Gypsy Norton of Honolulu.
   ``We thought that would be great, no problem,'' Woodruff said.
   She recalled going to a grocery store in Kuwait City the night
the group arrived, and finding long lines of people stocking up on
food.
   ``We should have known something was wrong,'' she said.
   Back at their host's beach house, they were approached by
officers dressed in uniforms of the Kuwaiti coast guard, but
learned later they were Iraqi soldiers in disguise.
   Early the next morning, they found that Kuwait had been invaded.
   ``Our host told us to grab our suitcases, that we had to get out
quickly,'' she recalled.
   ``We headed for the border of Saudi Arabia after our host made a
couple of calls,'' she said. ``It was chaos at the border. People
were panic stricken. It was so bizarre. We sat for three hours,
crammed in a van. Finally we were able to get across because of our
host's connections. We got out 30 minutes before they closed the
Saudi border.''
   She said there was an eerie change in the environment in the 24
hours they spent in Kuwait.
   ``When we got there it was so beautiful, so peaceful. You could
feel the gloom, the panic when we left. We didn't realize the
danger we were in. Everybody thought he (Saddam Hussein) would pull
his troops out in a day or two.''
   She said the group's host had the instinct not to take them to
the American embassy, where they would have faced further danger
and delay.
   ``His first instinct was just to get us out of the country,''
she said.
   The entertainers, accompanied by a driver from the Kuwaiti royal
family, made it to Alkabar, Saudi Arabia. They were eventually
contacted by representatives of the Saudi royal family and got
assistance from a source Woodruff won't identify, even to her
family, because of security concerns.
   The group was able to get out of Saudi Arabia in time to finish
a scheduled engagement in Morocco before returning home.
   Woodruff's mother, Shirley Rankin, spent many tense hours early
in the invasion when news reports indicated the entertainers and a
member of the royal family were missing.
   ``This has made the world a lot smaller to us,'' she said
Tuesday.
   ``I thought it would be an adventure for her, but nothing like
this,'' Mrs. Rankin said.

<HEAD>Symington, Goddard Declare War; Mecham Out Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican J. Fife Symington III heads into a
gubernatorial showdown against Democrat Terry Goddard with a
less-than-ringing endorsement from former Gov. Evan Mecham.
   ``I'll support Fife,'' said Mecham, who lost his comeback
attempt in Tuesday's primary. ``As I've said many times, Goddard
will be a 100 percent disaster. Fife will only be an 80 percent
disaster.''
   With 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Symington
had 161,347 votes or 44 percent to Mecham's 89,496 votes or 24
percent in the five-way GOP race. Goddard had 209,454 votes or 84
percent to beat perennial candidate David Moss, who 39,970 or 16
percent.
   ``Now, the great battle begins,'' said Symington, a millionaire
developer, of his general election contest with Goddard, the former
Phoenix mayor who also is known as Samuel P. Goddard III.
   Mecham was seeking a political comeback 2{ years after his
impeachment conviction and removal. Analysts said his chances were
doomed by higher-than-anticipated turnout. In addition, the
five-way race split the vote.
   ``This isn't particularly an excuse because we knew this going
in _ it's a little difficult for ... one Libertarian and two
conservatives to beat a liberal,'' Mecham said, referring to others
among the GOP losers.
   Mecham refused to say whether he would run for office again.
   Democrat Rose Mofford, the secretary of state who became
governor upon Mecham's ouster, had decided to retire rather than
seek the office in her own right.
   The Republican turnout of about 41.3 percent was well above the
expected 35 percent to 37 percent. Pollsters Earl DeBerge and Bruce
Merrill attributed it Symington's last-minute ad blitz.
   ``We saw the undecided vote dropping very quickly in the last
week,'' said Merrill, who had predicted a possible Mecham victory
if turnout stayed below 35 percent. ``The decideds flowed
principally to Symington.''
   Symington, 45, portrayed as the liberal in the GOP primary, used
his victory speech to get in his first jabs at Goddard, 43, son of
former governor Sam Goddard and a descendant of one of Abraham
Lincoln's confidantes.
   Goddard ``is a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis
liberal Democrat, and I'm a Goldwater conservative, and I'm proud
of it,'' said Symington, who graduated from Harvard in 1968.
   ``Actually, I'm not a professional politician,'' replied
Goddard, Harvard class of 1969. ``I'm a professional lawyer and am
not politically employed at the moment.''
   Symington, no stranger to politics, ran a major campaign in the
mid-1980s to promote a retail office complex that he was developing
over then-Mayor Goddard's objections. His great-grandfather, Henry
Clay Frick, founded U.S. Steel and his uncle, Stuart Symington, was
a U.S. senator.
   Symington announced for the Republican nomination last year,
saying he feared Mecham would win it by default even though he was
``a schoolyard bully'' who deserved ``a poke ... in the nose.''
Mecham in his turn attacked Symington as a candidate of corrupt
powerbrokers.
   Goddard, elected mayor as an anti-establishment outsider in
1983, quickly moved to the center. His family is wealthy and, like
Symington who far outspent his GOP opponents, Goddard can mobilize
wealth for his campaigns. He resigned as mayor for the governor's
run.
   Goddard loves ceremonies, treasures the plaques he receives and
has kept a firefighter's uniform in the trunk of his car.
   Symington was a major financial backer of the drive to recall
Mecham in 1988. The recall election was called off when the state
Senate, sitting as Court of Impeachment, voted to oust Mecham on
charges of obstructing justice and misusing state money.
   Among the other GOP primary candidates, former Maricopa County
Supervisor Fred Koory had 17 percent. Former congressman and Mecham
aide Sam Steiger, who previously had run for governor as a
Libertarian, had 13 percent. Former Mecham aide Bob Barnes had 2
percent.

   When it comes to acting, ``thirtysomething''
star Ken Olin says his wife is definitely the better half.
   ``I don't think I had a great natural gift for acting, the way I
believe Patty (Wettig) does,'' Olin says in the Oct. 1 issue of US
magazine.
   The couple co-star on the hit yuppie ensemble drama and that
success can cause difficulties, Olin confessed.
   ``It has its problems . . . There's also a competition there. We
don't want there to be, but there is. And you have to deal with
that and give each other a lot of support,'' said Olin, who has
directed his wife in an award-winning episode.
   ``She performs differently when I direct. She has a luminous
quality. It's fun to work that way,'' he said.

   Andrew Dice Clay and Eddie Murphy will likely
tone down their comedy routines to keep their acts popular,
predicts veteran funny man Bill Cosby.
   ``A comedian has to be liked. If people don't like you, they
definitely don't see anything funny about you,'' Cosby said in an
interview this week on the syndicated television show
``Personalities.''
   ``The only business that I know of is in the field of sports,
where you can be disliked and make a living,'' Cosby said.
   Cosby singled out Murphy and Clay as examples of comics whose
humor will probably change as they get older.
   ``I know that when they hit 30, whatever it is, man, they're not
going to want to be known as the guys who said and grabbed and did
all of that (scatological humor). Especially, if they have kids
growing up,'' said Cosby.

   Actor Matthew Modine says the worship of movie
stars might come from a troubled state of world affairs.
   ``Throughout history, actors have been outcasts. People locked
up their daughters when they came to town, and God forbid your son
should become one,'' Modine says in the October issue of Details
magazine.
   ``Maybe they're revered today because the world has become a
rather grim place and people need something to entertain them,''
said the blond, dimpled actor who has also starred in ``Married to
the Mob'' and ``Birdy.''
   The actor of the soon to be released movies, ``Memphis Belle''
and ``Pacific Heights,'' says he works in a ``cutthroat business''
where people will do some extreme things, including having sex, to
be a success.
   But Modine, who grew up in Utah, says that's not him.
   ``Early on I decided there were certain things I wasn't going to
do, and I've tried to be true to that decision,'' he told the

   Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller say they
were working New York City nightclubs when contemporary comedy was
still elbowing its way onto stages.
   After taking the stage in the late-1950s, and with help from the
``Ed Sullivan Show,'' Stiller and Meara took their act on the road
and began to reset the American funny bone.
   ``When we started, it was something you had to do to find your
own voice,'' Stiller said during a recent interview. ``The whole
business fell into place, like the people who came into the scene.
Improvisation was just beginning, it was pre-Second City.
   ``The genre changed, it became more cerebral,'' he recalled.
   ``We kind of fool around and improvise, get maybe 25 minutes of
talk and look for the core of what's going on,'' Stiller said of
their creative process.
   The husband-and-wife team went West and worked at casino resorts
in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Reno, where the more ethnically
diverse casino crowd quickly embraced the act and their popularity
grew.
   The pair will make their first appearance in Atlantic City when
they begin a weekend stand at Trump Plaza on Friday night.
   Although they have enjoyed success as stand-up comedians, both
have been critically acclaimed in dramatic roles ranging from
Shakespeare to public television's Great Performances and American
Playhouse.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has decided to sell her Silver
Fox Farm horse ranch for nearly $4 million, and she's hung a ``for
sale'' sign again on her Bel-Air mansion. She wants $15 million for
that property.
   Miss Gabor and her husband, Fredrick von Anhalt, bought the
20-acre Ventura County ranch in February for $1.75 million, said
Beverly Hills real estate agent Mike Silverman.
   Listed seven months later for $3.95 million, the ranch has a
48-stall barn, corrals, a six-horse electric walker, lighted show
ring, an eight-unit apartment building and a ranch house, Silverman
said Wednesday.
   Silverman and Associates also has the Bel-Air listing.
   The home, once owned by Howard Hughes and Elvis Presley, is a
two-story French Regency on a one-acre parcel near estates owned by
former President Reagan and movie star Warren Beatty.
   The house, which has been on and off the market since 1988,
features city views, a swimming pool, two master suites, an
upstairs ballroom and an aerobics room.

<HEAD>East Germany Fires Officers Who Worked in Secret Police</HEAD>

   East Germany fired 30 former secret police
agents from official posts after learning that thousands may be
working in the government, officials said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, activists who helped bring down the Communist
government went on a hunger strike Wednesday to demand access to
their secret police files.
   The country has become obsessed with the remnants of the vast
Communist intelligence network as the nation moves closer to
unification with West Germany on Oct. 3. The two nations are
fighting over which territory should have the files the old regime
kept on 6 million Germans.
   The activists and some East German politicians are demanding
that only East Germans control the documents compiled by the secret
police, known as the Stasi.
   Last week, a Parliament committee formed to oversee the
dissolution of the dreaded security arm turned over a list of 6,000
one-time agents who were employed in the country's various
ministries, the East Berlin paper Der Morgen reported Wednesday.
   Government spokesman Matthias Gehler told a news conference on
Wednesday that 30 former agents had been fired and 26 placed on
leaves of absence, and that others were under investigation.
   Forty-two of those affected were working in the Interior Minstry
of Peter-Michael Diestel. He has come under fire for his reluctance
to dismiss former agents known to be working in his ministry.
   Diestel's resignation is among the demands of 22 activists who
have been occupying the archives of the secret police in East
Berlin. The activists include leaders of the New Forum civic group,
which helped lead the peaceful revolt last fall that toppled the
hard-line Communist regime.
   They began occupying the building Sept. 4 and announced a hunger
strike beginning Wednesday. They are demanding that the East
Germany retain control of the files after unification and that
people who were spied upon have an opportunity to read their
records.
   Officials from both Germanys have been negotiating a solution to
the question of where to put the potentially explosive records.
They agreed on Tuesday that the West German intelligence agency
will not have control over them.

   A 66-year-old physician, a botanist and a
marine biologist were among four men and four women picked today to
spend two years inside a 2\-acre sealed dome intended to be a
microcosm of Earth.
   The eight from the United States, West Germany, England and
Belgium will be the crew of the giant terrarium known as Biosphere
II. The privately financed $30 million project aims for a December
start.
   Biosphere II will resemble a space colony tethered to Earth. It
will be a laboratory for solving environmental problems on
Biosphere I _ the Earth _ as well as a prototype for sustaining
life outside this world.
   The crew, all single, consists of:
   _ Dr. Roy Walford, 66, the oldest crew member and only
physician, a research gerontologist, nutritionist and professor of
pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine, and the project's medical
chief and biomedical consultant.
   _ Linda Leigh, 38, a botanist who directed and coordinated the
project's ecosystem planning for land areas, or biomes, directed
the collection and acquisition of more than 2,000 plant species and
spent three weeks last fall inside a completely closed test module.
   _ Bernd Zabel, 41, an electrical engineer from Munich, West
Germany, who served as construction general manager for the project.
   _ Sally Silverstone, 35, a native of Walthamstow, England, who
has administered the Space Biospheres Ventures' architectural
division.
   _ Abigail K. Alling, 31, a marine biologist from Maine with
degrees from Middlebury College and Yale University who has
directed the Biosphere's marine ecological systems.
   _ Taber Kyle MacCallum, 26, of Albuquerque, N.M., in charge of
the Biosphere's analytical laboratory.
   _ Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, a native of Surrey, England, who
has been manager of the intensive agriculture system.
   _ Mark Van Thillo, of Wilrijk-Antwerp, Belgium, who has been in
charge of construction quality control.
   Two others who had been finalists included Norberto
Alvarez-Romo, 37, of Guadalajara, Mexico, and Silke Schneider, 31,
a West German.
   For two years, the crew's world inside the geodesic frame of
glass and steel will consist of seven ecological regions: rain
forest, savannah, ocean, fresh and saltwater marshes, desert,
agriculture and human habitat. The latter includes apartments and
laboratory, office and recreational facilities.
   Sprinkled into the ecological stew will be 3,800 plant and
animal species. All air, water and food will be generated
independently of the Earth's atmosphere and will be recycled, as
will all wastes.
   The only link between the dome's ecological system and Earth
will be electrical power transmissions, as well as computers and
telecommunications.
   The experiment, a stepchild of Texas financier Edward P. Bass,
could become a money-producing venture, particularly as a means of
showing ways of responding to environmental problems such as
pollution, scientists have said.

   Iran's spiritual leader today called the
struggle against the United States a ``holy war,'' and said Moslems
who die fighting the U.S. presence in the region would go to heaven
as martyrs.
   The call by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came a day after Tehran
reprtedly agreed to give Iraq food and medicine in exchange for oil
and cash. Such a deal could puncture the U.N. embargo that aims to
force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   It also came two days after Iran said it plans to renew full
diplomatic relations with Iraq, which is seeking to break out of
the isolation imposed on it since it invaded Kuwait Aug 2.
   Speaking on Tehran radio, Khamenei said: ``Moslem nations will
not allow America to set up its security and defense system in the
region.''
   ``The struggle against American aggression, greed, plans and
policies in the Persian Gulf will be counted as Jihad (holy war),
and anybody who is killed on that path is a martyr,'' he said on
the radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   Analysts said Khamenei's comments may have been aimed at
placating anti-Western radicals in the Tehran hiearchy who have
been critical of the U.S. presence as well as the moderating
policies of President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Both Khamenei and Rafsanjani have in recent months headed off
criticism from radicals by issuing hard-line statements that appear
intended for internal consumption.
   A well-informed source in Tehran, speaking in a telephone
interview late Tuesday, said Iran's leaders had agreed to Iraq's
request for the trade deal, which he said would involve shipments
of 200,000 barrels of refined oil a day.
   There was no official comment from Tehran or Baghdad on the
reported agreement. But the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it was struck during a visit Sunday by Iraq's
foreign minister, Tariq Aziz.
   He was the first senior Iraqi official to visit Iran in 15 years.
   Facing mounting international isolation after its seizure of
Kuwait, Iraq suddenly sought a formal settlement with Iran, its foe
in an eight-year war that ended in a 1988 cease-fire.
   It exchanged prisoners of war, withdrew troops from disputed
territory and agreed to share the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, for Iraq
a vital outlet to the Persian Gulf.
   The effort is expected to free up hundreds of thousands of Iraqi
troops along the 730-mile Iranian border for redeployment in the
faceoff with a U.S.-led multinational force across the Kuwaiti and
Iraqi borders in Saudi Arabia.
   The Tehran Times reported in an editorial today that Iran was
``studying the issue of providing food and medicine to Iraq.''
   The English-language daily, which reflects government thinking,
said ``once Iran finalizes its decision and starts shipping food
and medicine to Iraq, political circles here believe, Iraq will
have an outlet in its present strapped situation.
   ``Iranian officials are convinced that the Moslem Iraqi people
should not pay for the mistakes of their government. Iraqi children
and women have had no role in the occupation of Kuwait by Baghdad
troops,'' the paper added.
   It made no mention of receiving oil in return. Oil is Iraq's key
earner, but the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Baghdad has
choked exports.
   Tehran has called for Iraq's immediate and unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait and Rafsanjani of Iran said last month that
his country would would honor the international sanctions.
   But Iran also opposes the U.S. military buildup in the region
and claimed on the eve of the Aziz visit that food and medicine
shipments would not violate the U.N. embargo, which aims to force
Saddam Hussein to relinquish Kuwiat.
   Iraq has been desperately seeking ways of beating the sanctions.
   On Monday, Saddam offered free oil to developing nations. But at
least publicly, there appeared to be no takers.
   The source in Tehran said the Iranians refused Iraq's offer of
full payment in oil for the commodities but agreed to take up to
200,000 barrels of refined oil a day _ about $6 million worth.
   Well-informed oil industry sources in the region, contacted by
the AP, say that although Iran is a major oil exporter itself, it
currently has to import about 150,000 barrels of refined oil a day
for domestic use.
   Iranian refineries, damaged in the 1980-88 war with Iraq, are
unable to meet the domestic daily consumption of 750,000 barrels.
   The oil industry sources said Iraq's Bazargan oilfields, or a
refinery in Basra, just 12 miles from the border, could be used to
supply that oil.
   Iran currently is exporting about 2.5 million barrels of crude a
day. It has already benefited from the Persian Gulf crisis, which
has nearly doubled the price of oil over the last few weeks to
about $30 a barrel.
   That windfall has earned billions of dollars for Tehran, which
is desperate for foreign exchange for post-war reconstruction.
   Unconfirmed reports from Baghdad say the Iranians already have
allowed rice, flour and wheat consignments across the border.
   But Iran, which imports more than 40 percent of its food, would
be hard-pressed to divert much food to Iraq, experts say. They note
that it lacks the port facilities to deal with a much higher volume
of imports.

   A quarrel between passengers and the
operator of an overcrowded ferry started a melee that caused the
boat to capsize, drowning about 90 people, officials said Wednesday.
   About 150 people were jammed aboard the boat when it overturned
Wednesday in the Mahava River in Uttar Pradesh state, said the
officials.
   The state's home secretary, A.K. Rastogi, blamed the tragedy on
an argument over the fare, which began as the vessel reached
midstream.
   Most of the victims were Moslems packed into the boat to attend
a fair commemorating an Islamic saint, the officials said. The boat
was built to carry between 90 and 100 people, they said.
   The state promised $575 to each family suffering a loss in the
accident.

   Drop the date with destiny, it's back to
the doghouse for Asta, a wirehair terrier whose owners thought was
on the verge of a Broadway bow-wow.
   The dog was one of five finalists for the Broadway role of the
original Asta, the terrier thespian who starred in the ``Thin Man''
movies.
   Owner Joanne Eisenberg, an aficionado of all things ``Thin
Man,'' had named her dog after the movie's dog.
   But the namesake, though seemingly a natural, didn't get the
role in ``Nick and Nora,'' the Broadway musical based on Dashiell
Hammett's famous gumshoe.
   Asta got the rejection notice in a letter addressed to Eisenberg.
   How is she taking it?
   ``She's just with her scrapbook and her memories,'' Eisenberg
said Sunday.

   A 1940 law that protects military reservists
on active duty from debt collectors back home needs updating to fit
today's economic realities, witnesses told Congress Wednesday.
   For example, the provision prohibiting landlords from evicting
members the reserves and the National Guard who have been called up
applies only if the rent is $150 a month or less.
   ``Obviously, inflation has seriously affected the usefulness of
that figure in today's rental market,'' said Assistant Defense
Secretary Christopher Jehn. The law was last revised in 1966,
during the Vietnam War.
   Since Irag occupied Kuwait Aug. 2 and the United States began
its Persian Gulf buildup, lenders, landlords and employers have
been cooperating with the military call-up, in many cases writing
down the expenses of soldiers and sailors on duty in the gulf or in
the United States filling in for others sent to the gulf, said a
House Veterans Affairs Committee aide who requested anonymity.
   But that isn't expected to last forever.
   ``Recently, the president announced that by Oct. 1, about 47,000
of the 1.17 million civilians who belong to the reserves and
National Guard will be called to active duty'' since the buildup
began, said Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee.
   He told Wednesday's joint hearing with the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee that the call-up has prompted many inquiries
about the protections in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief
Act.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. and the chairman of the Senate
committee, said service members told him during his recent four-day
trip to visit troops in Saudi Arabia that they were worried about
their financial obligations back home.
   The law prohibits debt collectors and others from taking any
action against reservists who are on active duty and who
temporarily are unable to meet their obligations because of their
military duty.
   Assistant Secretary Jehn said his office is preparing
recommendations for Congress to revise the law in the following
areas:
   _Eviction Protection. Jehn said a suggestion has been made to
raise the $150 limit on protected rent to $750, with an escalator
provision tied to the Consumer Price Index.
   _Interest Rates. Under current law, interest owed by an
active-duty reservist on debts ranging from mortgages to credit
cards must drop to 6 percent during the active duty, but it is not
clear whether the interest is compound or simple and whether that
portion unpaid is to be forgiven or must be paid later.
   _Credit Protection. Jehn said the law needs specific language
that protects the service member's credit rating.
   _Court Proceedings and Default Judgments. More detailed language
is needed to protect service members involved in legal proceedings
from problems that could arise from missing court appearances.
   _Malpractice Insurance. Doctors called to active duty need
adjustments in their insurance rates to account for losses in
income during military service.
   _Tuition Reimbursement. Some students called into active duty
need to be assured they will be reimbursed for pre-paid tuition for
classes they find they cannot attend.

<HEAD>Tourism Rises Despite War in Sri Lanka</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite renewed warfare between Tamil
rebels and the government, tourism is on the rise in this Indian
Ocean island of beaches, gems and jungles, officials said Wednesday.
   The number of foreign tourists who arrived in the past three
months, when Tamil guerrillas and the army were fighting their
biggest battles in recent years, soared 62 percent over the same
period last year, the government tourist board reported.
   For the first eight months of 1990, the rate of increase was 4
percent over the comparable period in 1989.
   ``The increase is mainly because the situation has improved in
Sri Lanka,'' said M.N.L. Lantra, director of research for the
Tourist Board. ``Last year there were problems in the south and
central regions of the country, but this year the violence is
confined to the north and east.''
   In June, Tamil rebels resumed their 7-year-old violent campaign
to carve out a separate homeland for their ethnic minority. Tamils
have long accused the Sinhalese majority of discriminating against
them in jobs and education.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, while
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government. The violence has claimed more than 14,000 lives since
1983.
   Lantra said 18,050 tourists arrived in June, compared to 11,630
in June 1989. July arrivals were 26,410 this year, compared to
15,194 in 1989. And 26,786 tourists arrived last month, compared to
17,220 in August 1989.
   Last year tourism was badly hit by a murderous cycle of
assassinations and retaliations involving Sinhalese extremists and
pro-government forces. They peaked during the summer in the beach
resort areas of the south coast. The government quashed the revolt
last winter with the arrests and killings of the top leaders of the
People's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group that opposes
government concessions to the Tamils.
   Sri Lanka, formerly called Ceylon, had a short-lived respite
from its ethnic wars until June 11, when the Tamil Tiger rebels
broke a 13-month-old cease-fire and resumed the war in the
northeast.
   Shortly before the battle flared anew, tourists were starting to
return to the northeast, which has some of the island's best
beaches. Since June, the Tourist Board and some embassies have
advised foreigners to avoid unnecessary travel to the north and
east.
   Tourism has been a mainstay of Sri Lanka's economy. It provides
more than 50,000 jobs. When the Tamil revolt started in 1983,
tourism was at its peak with 337,000 arrivals per year.
   The number of arrivals dropped to 317,000 in 1984 and has
remained below 300,000 every year since then. The worst year was
1987 when 182,620 tourists arrived.

<TEXT>
   An improperly installed seal is
believed to have caused the hydrogen leaks that halted last week's
launch of the space shuttle Columbia, and it has been replaced,
NASA said today.
   The seal had been crushed and was found Tuesday during a check
of fuel lines inside the shuttle's aft compartment, said James
Hartsfield, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The seal was replaced Tuesday night and helium tests conducted
today produced no leakage in the area.
   NASA said today that Tuesday is its target date for a fourth
attempt to launch Columbia, and that Oct. 8 is the day it hopes to
launch Discovery.
   The Teflon seal, about 2{ inches in diameter, is part of a valve
on a hydrogen line that leads to one of the shuttle's three main
rocket engines, he said.
   ``They feel extremely confident that's what stopped our show
last time,'' Hartsfield said. ``They think they've cured it. It's a
great thing to be able to say.''
   Officials believe the seal was misinstalled after Columbia's
last flight in January, Hartsfield said.
   The countdown for Columbia's astronomy mission was delayed for
the third time last week by leaking hydrogen. Workers on Monday
installed a new set of recirculation pumps, which engineers
initially believed was the source of the leaks.
   Columbia's flight with seven astronauts and a $150 million Astro
observatory has been on hold since May, when leaking hydrogen fuel
first was detected. A second launch attempt earlier this month was
put off because of problems with one of Astro's four telescopes.
   Time is running out for Columbia, which must lift off next week
or be delayed until after Discovery is launched on a top-priority
mission in October.
   Discovery has from Oct. 5 to Oct. 23 to lift off with a
plutonium-powered satellite called Ulysses that will be sent on a
five-year journey to study the sun's polar regions. If NASA misses
that deadline, Discovery's $750 million mission will have to be
postponed until late 1991, when Earth is aligned properly again
with the sun and Jupiter.
   Jupiter's gravity will be used to whip Ulysses into the proper
orbit around the sun. It will be the first spacecraft to circle
over the sun's poles.
   Milt Heflin, flight director for the Ulysses mission, said at a
news briefing today at Johnson Space Center that he is confident
Discovery will be able to lift off on Oct. 5 or soon afterward. No
hydrogen leaks were detected during Discovery's last flight in
April, and that is a good sign the shuttle will not leak during
fueling, he said.
   A leak in Discovery's cooling system is not rapid enough to
force a postponement of the mission, NASA officials said.
   NASA has not launched a shuttle since Discovery's April flight
with the Hubble Space Telescope, which later was found to have a
defective mirror.

   The European Community should impose lower speed
limits throughout its member countries to fight air pollution,
French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde said in an interview
published Wednesday.
   Lalonde also told Le Figaro newspaper that German automakers
were losing their reputation for environmental awareness by
producing too many powerful cars. There is no speed limit on many
sections of the West German highway system.
   Lalonde noted that the EC has no jurisdiction over traffic
safety rules in the 12 member nations. But if the EC set limits for
carbon monoxide emissions, he said, ``we could then limit speeds on
the European level in the framework of the fight against
pollution.''
   He did not suggest specific speed limits.
   Outside West Germany, speed limits among EC countries range from
86.6 mph on some Italian highways to 55 mph in Ireland, which does
not have an extensive highway system.
   The 12 EC nations are France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,
Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and
the United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Study: Crack Cocaine Linked to Strokes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who smoke crack cocaine appear to increase
their risk of strokes, and doctors should consider drug abuse
whenever treating young people with strokes, a study concludes.
   The report found ``a strong temporal, if not causal,'' link
between crack and strokes.
   ``We believe that the ongoing crack epidemic will lead to more
cocaine-related strokes,'' the researchers wrote.
   The report describes 28 people who suffered strokes within 72
hours of smoking crack. Other researchers have found similar links
between strokes and other forms of cocaine.
   They said that doctors should take a thorough history of drug
use and give blood and urine tests when evaluating ``any young
patient with a stroke.''
   The report, by Dr. Steven R. Levine of Henry Ford Hospital in
Detroit and other doctors, was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   Of the patients studied, two-third suffered symptoms of strokes
within an hour of using cocaine.
   Most had been regular crack users for at least two years,
although one had smoked it only occasionally and another was
stricken after his first use.
   The researchers theorize that crack and other forms of cocaine
could trigger strokes in several ways. The drug raises blood
pressure, and this could cause a blood vessel in the brain to
burst. The drug also causes heart rhythm abnormalities, which could
trigger the formation of a clot that travels to the brain and
blocks a blood vessel. Cocaine could also causes spasms that make
blood vessels in the brain squeeze shut, starving brain tissue.
   The study was based on stroke cases seen by doctors in Detroit,
New York, Miami and New Haven, Conn.

   Following are excerpts from the treaty signed
Wednesday by the four World War II Allies and the two Germanys
settling the global aspects of German unification. The document is
titled Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect To Germany:
   The Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic,
the French Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America,
   Conscious of the fact that their peoples have been living
together in peace since 1945;
   Mindful of the recent historic changes in Europe which make it
possible to overcome the division of the continent;
   Having regard to the rights and responsibilities of the Four
Powers relating to Berlin and to Germany as a whole, and the
corresponding wartime and postwar agreements and decisions of the
Four Powers;
   Resolved in accordance with their obligations under the Charter
of the United Nations to develop friendly relations among nations
based on respect for the principle of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate
measures to strenghen universal peace;
   Recalling the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed in Helsinki;
   Recognizing that those principles have laid firm foundations for
the establishment of a just and lasting peaceful order in Europe;
   Determined to take account of everyone's security interests;
   Convinced of the need finally to overcome antagonism and to
develop cooperation in Europe;
   Confirming their readiness to reinforce security, in particular
by adopting effective arms control, disarmament and

their right of self-determination, have expressed their will to
bring about the unity of Germany as a state so that they will be
able to serve the peace of the world as an equal and sovereign
partner in a united Europe;
   Convinced that the unification of Germany as a state with
definitive borders is a significant contribution to peace and
stability in Europe;
   Intending to conclude the final settlement with respect to
Germany;
   Recognizing that thereby, and with the unification of Germany as
a democratic and peaceful state, the rights and responsibilities of
the Four Powers relating to Berlin and to Germany as a whole lose
their function;
   Represented by their Ministers for Foreign Affairs who, in
accordance with the Ottawa Declaration of 13 February 1990, met in
Bonn on 5 May 1990, in Berlin on 22 June 1990, in Paris on 17 July
1990 with the participation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
the Republic of Poland, and in Moscow on 12 September 1990;
   Have agreed as follows:
   The united Germany shall comprise the territory of the Federal
Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the whole
of Berlin. Its external borders shall be the borders of the Federal
Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and shall be
definitive from the date on which the present Treaty comes into
force.
   The united Germany and the Republic of Poland shall confirm the
existing border between them in a treaty that is binding under
international law.
   The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against
other states and shall not assert any in the future.
   The governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the
German Democratic Republic reaffirm their declarations that only

and of Berlin ... only German territorial defense units which are
not integrated into the alliance structures ... will be stationed
in that territory as armed forces of the united Germany. During
that period .... armed forces of other states will not be stationed
in that territory or carry out any other military activity there.
   For the duration of the presence of Soviet armed forces in the
territory of the present German Democratic Republic and of Berlin,
armed forces of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain ... and the United States of America will ... remain
stationed in Berlin. ...
   Following the completion of the withdrawal of the Soviet armed
forces ... units of German armed forces assigned to military
alliance structures ... may also be stationed in that part of
Germany, but without nuclear weapon carriers. This does not apply
to conventional weapon systems which may have other capabilities in
addition to conventional ones but which in that part of Germany are
equipped for a conventional role and designated only for such.
Foreign armed forces and nuclear weapons or their carriers will not
be stationed in that part of Germany or deployed there.
   The united Germany shall have ... full sovereignty over its
internal and external affairs.

<HEAD>Helen Hayes Says Artist Edward Hopper was Grumpy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As she approaches her 90th birthday, grande dame
of the theater, Helen Hayes, has some stories to tell. There's not
many who can say they danced the conga with artist Diego Rivera or
knew Edward Hopper well enough to call him ``a grumpy old son of a
gun.''
   Hayes, whose birthday is Oct. 10, is an avid art collector and
was a friend to many contemporary artists including Peter Hurd and
Walt Kuhn.
   In an article written for the October issue of Arts &amp; Antiques
magazine, she talks about some of those friends including Hopper,
who lived down the street from Hayes and her playwright husband
Charles McArthur in Nyack.
   She recalls her husband asking Hopper to paint a picture of
their beloved Victorian home, ``Pretty Penny.''
   ``Oh, what a grumpy old son of a gun he was! So unappealing.
There we all sat in our living room with his wife and agent and he
refused to have anything to do with painting the house,'' Hayes
recalled. ```I have to have air in my paintings' he said adamantly
and left.''
   A few weeks later, the actress' daughter, Mary, came home and
announced there was a man outside making a picture of their house.
   ``I went to the window and sure enough, there was Hopper, grumpy
as ever, sketching our house.''
   She said she met Rivera in Acapulco when she was invited to a
New Year's Eve party at the home of a woman who often posed for the
artist.
   ``While Diego labored in his studio above us, we began to make
merry and started a conga line. Suddenly, Diego appeared downstairs
in his pajamas and joined the line.''
   And Hayes' assessment of the artists dancing prowess? ``He
congaed the way he did everything else _ very intensely.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers from energy-dependent states
proposed legislation Wednesday that would allow the president to
prohibit unreasonable oil and gasoline price increases during a
national emergency.
   ``The price of gas has gone up more than 20 percent in the last
month and has stayed up, even when crude oil prices dropped
temporarily, and even when other nations began increasing their
output of oil to make up for the Iraq and Kuwait shortfall,'' said
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who introduced the legislation.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the major oil
industries, called the proposal a thinly disguised effort to revive
the price controls of the 1970s that led to long lines at gas
stations.
   Under the proposal, the attorney general would have the power to
investigate cases of alleged price gouging. A conviction for
profiteering could result in jail time and up to a $500,000 fine.
   The federal government would also have the power to seize any
illegally obtained profits from oil companies.
   Seventeen senators and 29 representatives, most from northern,
energy-consuming states, joined in proposing the legislation.

   Fourteen teachers' union leaders were
sentenced to jail terms starting Thursday for defying a court order
to end a week-long strike in suburban South Orange and Maplewood.
   Officials for the South Orange-Maplewood Education Association
said Wednesday they would appeal the 30-day jail sentences.
   ``This punitive action will not end the strike,'' said Farrell
Fand, a union spokesman. ``Only a fair and equitable contract for
school staff members in South Orange-Maplewood will bring the
strike to an end.''
   New Jersey wasn't the only state troubled by disputes with its
teachers.
   In Washington's Mukilteo School District, 470 teachers were in
the third week of a strike with no new talks scheduled. Talks broke
down Monday in the 9,100-student district, and all classes remained
closed despite earlier plans to hire substitutes.
   And in Illinois, teachers in the Knoxville School District were
on strike, idling 1,300 students. A spokesman for the Illinois
Education Association said Tuesday the 79 union-covered teachers
overwhelmingly rejected the latest school board offer and voted to
strike. Pickets went up Tuesday morning.
   Nancy Oxenfeld, an attorney for the 572-member South
Orange-Maplewood union said she would file an appeal with the
Appellate Division of Superior Court challenging the sentence
imposed Tuesday.
   Superior Court Judge Irwin Kimmelman ordered union president
Sally Talmadge and 13 officers to begin serving the sentence
Thursday morning at the Essex County Jail. Each officer also was
fined $500 for disobeying a back-to-work order issued last week.
   Kimmelman said he would reduce the sentence to 15 days if union
leaders wrote a letter to the membership encouraging them to return
to work. He also fined the union $35,000.
   Strikes by teachers and other public employees are barred under
state law and they are usually ordered by the courts to return to
work.
   A judge in Gloucester County also dealt a blow to striking
teachers in the 3,400-student Deptford school system.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Francis said he would begin contempt
proceedings if teachers in the 331-member Deptford union did not
report to work Wednesday. Francis issued a back-to-work order Sept.
5, when teachers set up pickets on the first day of school.
   Teachers did not show up for work Wednesday. Francis was meeting
with attorneys privately Wednesday afternoon and contempt
proceedings had not yet been filed.
   Deptford union officials say the dispute centers on how much
instruction time should be added to each teaching day in elementary
schools.
   Substitute teachers have held classes in Deptford and in South
Orange-Maplewood since walkouts began.
   In South Orange-Maplewood the dispute centered on salary, fringe
benefits and working conditions, union officials said.

<TEXT>
   A man who admitted he killed a young couple
in a $40 holdup and opposed efforts to appeal his death sentence
has died by injection in Illinois' first execution in 28 years.
   Charles Walker, 50, was pronounced dead at 12:12 a.m. at
Stateville Prison. The high school dropout had spent 24 years of
his life in prison for various offenses.
   The case had been watched closely by opponents of capital
punishment _ who feared it would open the floodgates on executions
in Illinois, where 124 people are on Death Row.
   ``Tell Jesse and tell Vi that I will see them later. You're a
good man,'' Walker told Warden Thomas Roth as he went to his death.
He was referring to Jesse Mathes, a minister, and to his girlfriend.
   In the death chamber, Walker looked out at the witnesses, nodded
briefly, and then seemed to glance about the room. At his right
stood a metal pole holding an intravenous bag with the drugs that
would kill him.
   There was no direct signal when the injection started, but
Walker blinked and moved his lips, his eyes raised toward the
ceiling. After a moment, he shook his head twice from side to side.
He seemed to take three or four deep breaths, his chest rising and
falling slowly.
   He looked as if he was staring at something far away before his
eyes closed altogether.
   The U.S. Supreme Court and Illinois' high court Tuesday had
rejected challenges by death-penalty opponents and two Death-Row
inmates, who contended the combination of drugs used in the
execution did not meet state law.
   Gov. James R. Thompson on Monday had refused to commute Walker's
sentence.
   Walker had opposed any attempt to save his life, saying he would
rather die for the 1983 murders of Kevin Paule, 21, and Paul's
fiancee, Sharon Winker, 25. The couple, who had been fishing near
Mascoutah, were tied to trees, robbed and shot.
   ``I'm guilty. I can accept my punishment,'' Walker once said.
``I'm sorry I done it, yeah, but it's done.''
   He became the 139th person executed in the United States since
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume use of the
death penalty.
   Illinois, which had not put an inmate to death since it sent a
man to the electric chair in 1962, is the 16th state since 1976 to
resume executions. Oklahoma became the 15th on Monday.

   The victors of World War II on Wednesday signed
one of the most important documents of the postwar era, giving
international sanction to both German unity and a major reshaping
of the East-West balance of power.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III proclaimed the signing a
``rendezvous with history.''
   ``This represents the end of a 45-year journey,'' Baker said
after he and the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and the two Germanys signed a treaty settling the global
aspects of German unification.
   At the signing ceremony inside Moscow's posh October Hotel,
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev watched West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher affix the first signature, followed
by East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who is also
foreign minister.
   The Allies were next: French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Baker and British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   The seven men shook hands and drank a champagne toast
immediately after the signing.
   The sweeping document, called the Treaty on the Final Settlement
with Respect to Germany, climaxes seven months of tough bargaining
between the six nations.
   In it, the same four powers that defeated Germany in 1945 give
their seal of approval to German unity. It will lead to scrapping
their special rights in Germany _ such as their control of air
corridors into Berlin.
   The treaty was the last major document needed to clear the way
for merging the two Germanys on Oct. 3.
   Under the document, the Soviet Union loses East Germany as its
most valued military ally. The six nations agreed all of Germany
can belong to NATO.
   The Soviets will be allowed to keep their estimated 370,000
troops in East Germany for a maximum of four years. Armed forces of
the three Western World War II allies will be permitted to remain
in Berlin as long as Soviet troops are still in East Germany.
   The treaty also addresses Soviet concerns about the potential
might of a united Germany and about shifts in the European balance
of power.
   The Soviets won a pledge from the Germans they would put a cap
of 370,000 on their total troop strength. The two Germanys
currently have about 600,000 soldiers.
   Both German nations also vowed to renounce ownership or use of
atomic, chemical and biological weapons.
   The Soviets won a concession that no nuclear weapons would be
deployed on East German soil even after all Red Army troops are
withdrawn.
   The treaty also states that a united Germany will never try to
claim land forfeited to Poland after World War II.
   Poland had expressed reservations about a united Germany,
fearing the Germans might try to reclaim the territory.
   The horrible devastation of World War II, started by Nazi
Germany in 1939, is evoked in the six-nation treaty. Germany's
division _ and the start of the the Cold War era _ followed the
Nazis' 1945 defeat.
   ``The governments of the Federal Republic of Germany (West
Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) reaffirm
their declarations that only peace will emanate from German soil,''
the treaty states.
   It adds, ``According to the constitution of the united Germany,
acts tending to and undertaken with the intent to disturb the
peaceful relations between nations, especially to prepare for
aggressive war, are unconstitutional and punishable.''
   Genscher said the treaty signing was ``a day of joy and
jubilation'' for Germans, but that the victims of World War II and
the Nazi terror must never be forgotten and the ``agony of the
Jewish people'' never repeated.
   ``In this hour we remember the victims of war and totalitarian
domination,'' he said.
   Baker and his counterparts heralded the impending birth of a new
German nation.
   ``We have closed the book on World War II and started a new
age,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Negotiations on the treaty continued up until hours before
Wednesday afternoon's signing because of technicalities in the
wording.
   The Soviets wanted assurances there would be no large-scale NATO
maneuvers in what is now East Germany after the Red Army
withdrawal. A post-midnight session between Baker and Genscher
produced last-minute language, approved by the others, that the
Germans will judge what sort of maneuvers the Western alliance
might conduct _ but without any nuclear weapons.
   Resolving another nagging issue, the six ministers agreed to
permit launchers that could fire a nuclear payload to be based in
the present East Germany, but not actual nuclear weapons themselves.

   A gang of off-duty U.S. immigration guards
masqueraded as law enforcement officers and stole from people they
thought were illegal aliens or drug dealers, prosecutors said
Wednesday.
   Indictments unsealed Wednesday charged four Immigration and
Naturalization Service guards with robbing and burglarizing eight
``legitimate citizens'' who reported the crimes, District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau told reporters.
   But they are suspected of committing dozens of armed robberies
during the past year, preying mainly on people unlikely to go to
the police.
   ``There are probably victims who are drug dealers and who are
illegal immigrants,'' Morgenthau said. ``But it's more difficult to
get them to cooperate.''
   Gang members, who called themselves the ``Nasty Boys,'' posed as
FBI or INS agents or city police, usually wearing uniforms and
carrying badges and phony warrants, prosecutors said.
   They forced themselves into homes by telling their victims they
were on government business, although their only real jobs were as
guards at the INS detention center in lower Manhattan.
   Morgenthau said other guards from the center were involved, but
he would not speculate on a number. INS spokesman Charles Troy said
the center employs about 80 guards, supervisors and guard managers.
   The INS and the U.S. Justice Department are continuing the
investigation, along with local authorities.
   The defendants carried ``illegally possessed weapons'' in the
robberies, Morgenthau said, noting that they were unarmed when at
work.
   Most of the victims were Hispanic.
   The district attorney said any illegal alien who was victimized
by the gang and comes forward to help the prosecution might be
granted the legal right to remain in the country.
   ``It makes a difference to the INS,'' he said. ``The Number 1
thing is to root out corruption in government. That's our
priority.''
   Asked how someone might recognize that the perpetrators were not
real federal agents, Morgenthau said, ``They can't. That's why this
is such a really horrendous practice.''
   But he added: ``When they take your money, you know they're not
on official business and you should report that immediately.''
   The indictments charge that Pedro Galiano, 36, held up two men
May 22 in the lobby of their apartment building, handcuffed them
and physically assaulted them.
   Luis Nelson, 22, and Carol Canedo, 26, allegedly broke into an
apartment on July 7, forced a family into the living room and told
them they were searching for someone.
   When they left, the family discovered items missing, including
cash and jewelry, and realized they had been robbed, Assistant
District Attorney Michael Warren said.
   Nelson, Canedo and Benjamin Nazario, 36, also burglarized two
apartments on July 14, Warren said.
   All four are being held in lieu of $25,000 bail, he said.
   Nazario and Nelson had left their jobs at the time of their
arrests, said Troy. Canedo and Galiano were suspended without pay,
he said.
   Galiano was a supervisor and the most senior of the suspects,
having worked at the Manhattan center since 1983, Troy said.

   The letter from a soldier cited by
President Bush as a symbol of patriotism included some notes the
president didn't mention in his nationally televised address.
   ``As much as I love my job,'' wrote Army Pfc. Wade Merritt, ``I
don't believe in war or the unnecessary acts of violence against
fellow human beings, but it is my job.''
   The 26-year-old soldier, now in Saudi Arabia, told his parents
in the Aug. 5 letter that, ``When I made a decision to make the
Army my career, I knew this day would come, but I was hoping it
wouldn't.''
   ``It is not inconsistent with the president's message,'' Alixe
Glen, a White House spokeswoman, said Wednesday of the letter.
   Merritt's mother, Ann, of Knoxville, sent the letter to the
White House at the prompting of a neighbor. Bush quoted part of it
in his speech to Congress and the nation Tuesday night on the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``My mom, I talked to her several weeks ago before I came over
here and she said some of her friends had read it,'' Merritt said
in a television interview Wednesday from the Middle East. ``They
got her to send it to the president. I was shocked.''
   In his speech, Bush cited Merritt as a symbol of patriotism.
``In the face of danger, they are brave, well trained and
dedicated,'' Bush said.
   Then the president read a passage from Merritt's 2{-page missive:
   ``I am proud of my country and its firm stand against inhumane
aggression. I am proud of my army and its men. ... I am proud to
serve my country.''
   The president continued, ``Let me just say, Wade, America is
proud of you. And grateful to every soldier, sailor, marine and
airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf.''
   Merritt's sister, Kim Inklebarger, said the family has ``always
felt that he was very special. He's always had a real special
artistic writing ability. So we are glad that it has been
recognized and we are pleased for him.''
   Mrs. Merritt said she told her son she sent the letter to Bush
was ``because it was beautiful and everybody loved it.''
   ``As Americans we often take our freedom for granted,'' wrote
Merritt, a member of the 24th Military Intelligence Battalion,
which shipped out from Fort Stewart, Ga., for Saudi Arabia on Aug.
19.
   ``Now the freedom of peaceful nations is being jeopardized and
it is the just duty of myself and my fellow men to restore freedom
and rights to our fellow men.''
   He wrote of how children take their parents for granted, how his
parents shouldn't worry about him and how hard he and his fellow
soldiers have been working ``so hard, in fact, that events
occurring hardly pass a thought.''
   ``I ask you to think about and pray for the safety and well
being of all our men and women in our armed forces and the other
peaceful and friendly nations,'' he wrote.
   ``Wish and pray for a peaceful and speedy solution to this whole
affair and may our adversaries think in this way too. Have faith in
our president and his decisions.''
   Merritt's father, Ken, said ``Wade has always been very macho
and gung ho about his country.'' But the elder Merritt added, ``He
lives within himself, he's sort of quiet. It takes something
special for him to express himself.''
   The family was notified Tuesday by the White House that the
letter would be included in the president's remarks. They gathered
round the television set to watch the speech, and then found
themselves on television Wednesday being interviewed by the network
morning talk shows.
   ``Wade, I never knew just writing this one letter would cause
all this,'' Mrs. Merritt told her son Wednesday in a telephone
conversation conducted in front of the TV cameras.
   Merritt's father said the family was ``quite elated that
President Bush mentioned the letter and mentioned our son's name.''
   ``But what's really important is that these are the feelings of
my son, not my feelings imposed on him. This is from his heart,''
he said.

   Dear Mom, Dad
   How are things going back home? I guess you know what's been
happening here. It happened at a bad time, I was really excited
about coming home. I can't tell you where I'm at or will be. You
should know by watching the news. All I can say is that it's going
to be a long and difficult time for all of us.
   As much as I love my job, I don't believe in war or the
unnecessary acts of violence against fellow human beings, but it is
my job. When I made a decision to make the Army my career, I knew
that this day would come, but I was hoping it wouldn't.
   As Americans we often take our freedom for granted. Now the
freedom of peaceful nations is being jeopardized and it is the just
duty of myself and my fellow men to restore freedom and rights to
our fellow men.
   I am proud of my country and its firm stand against inhumane
aggression. I am proud of my army and its men. I am proud to serve
my country and the interest of it and its allies.
   Things have been tough here and I know that you are concerned.
It's stupid but all I can ask from you is not to worry about me. If
it's the last thing I do I will see a Tennessee game this fall.
   We have been working very hard _ so hard in fact that events
occurring hardly pass in thought. I'm so tired at the end, I just
sleep and forget. I guess I don't try to think about it because it
scares me. It frightens all of us. If there is one thing that I
think about every minute, it's you.
   We children take our parents and family for granted. We are
always in such a hurry to live and lead our own lives that we
forget to think about it if we ever see them again. But I will see
you again and it will be a most joyous occasion.
   As I close this letter, I ask you not to think of just me, but
the important sacrifices that your other children make every day. I
ask you to think about and pray for the safety and well-being of
all our men and women in our armed forces and the other peaceful
and friendly nations. Wish and pray for a peaceful and speedy
solution to this whole affair and may our adversaries think in this
way too. Have faith in our president and his decisions.
   I will write you again at the next available time.
   Remember I love you very much, I love all of you. I look forward
to seeing you again, I will see you again. Keep the faith.
   Always your loving son,
   Wade

   One of the highest ranking Israeli delegations
to visit the Soviet Union in years left Wednesday for talks in
Moscow on bilateral and Middle East issues, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
   The visit, yet another sign of improving Israeli-Soviet
relations, comes against the background of a changing Soviet role
in the region.
   The Israeli delegation includes Arieh Levine, head of Israel's
consular delegation in Moscow; David Afek, head of the Foreign
Ministry's Center for Political Research; and two of the ministry's
deputy director-generals.
   ``This is the first time that diplomats of this level have been
invited by the Foreign Ministry of the Soviet Union,'' an Israeli
Foreign Ministry spokesman said. He briefed reporters on condition
of anonymity.
   The team is to lay the groundwork for Foreign Minister David
Levy's meeting this month with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, at the U.N. General Assembly. Government officials
said talks also would focus on Moscow's role in the Middle East
arms race, including its relations with Iraq and Syria.
   According to press reports, the team also may discuss Israel's
request for expanding its diplomatic mission in Moscow and raising
the level of political meetings in the Soviet capital.
   Moscow broke off diplomatic relations with the Jewish state
following the 1967 Middle East war. Ties have improved over the
past three years, and both countries have set up diplomatic
missions.
   ``I hope full diplomatic relations will be established very
soon,'' Levy told a news conference Wednesday.
   In addition to the diplomatic team, Israeli Housing Minister
Ariel Sharon is in Moscow to encourage more Soviet Jewish
emigration. He is the second Cabinet minister to visit the Soviet
Union in the past year.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials were quoted in Israeli newspapers
Wednesday as saying Washington may be willing to allow an expanded
role for the Soviet Union in Middle East peace efforts because of
Moscow's ``positive role'' in the gulf crisis.
   ``Israel must get used to a new era proclaiming a greater extent
of U.S.-Soviet coordination in political issues,'' the Hebrew daily
Maariv quoted a senior American official as saying.
   The official, who was not identified, suggested that
Israeli-Arab peace efforts in the future could involve a ``meeting
under joint auspices of the superpowers.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has long opposed Moscow's
proposal for an international peace conference on the region, but
he has not ruled out talks sponsored by the superpowers.
   Levy said at the news conference there was room for Soviet
involvement if Moscow changed its policy of arming Arab nations
hostile to Israel.
   American rapprochement with Syria, a longtime Soviet ally and
enemy of Israel, has given rise to suggestions the United States
may try to bring Israel and Syria together. Israeli officials said
they have not seen any specific proposals but are ready for direct
talks with any Arab leaders.

   President Bush videotaped a message Wednesday
telling the Iraqi people he has ``no quarrel'' with them and they
should blame any hardship from the Mideast crisis on their own
government, the White House said.
   On the eight-minute tape, which the White House hopes will be
broadcast unedited in Iraq, Bush says the U.S. military is in the
Persian Gulf only to defend Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression.
   ``We want a peaceful resolution. We want peaceful coexistence
with the people of Iraq,'' Bush says on the tape, according to
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The White House held off releasing a transcript, but Fitzwater
gave an overview of Bush's comments.
   The president's address was intended to create internal problems
for Saddam by emphasizing Iraq's isolation in the world community
as a result of the invasion of Kuwait. ush has said previously he
would not be unhappy if the people of Iraq removed Saddam from
power, and the address stressed that Iraqis are paying a heavy
price for his actions.
   The president consulted with Arab specialists, and met twice
with State Department and National Security Council officials to
come up with the wording, Fitzwater said.
   The Arab specialists were asked to look at the wording ``to make
sure that the tone of it translates well into Arabic,'' said one
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``You can write a
speech that sounds perfectly good to Western ears,'' but might not
convey the right impression in Arabic, the official said.
   Fitzwater described the message as ``a very candid but personal
description of our goals and our objectives in the region.''
   ``The president was forthright and didn't stage anything, just
gave a direct message,'' said Sig Rogich, Bush's assistant for
media consultation who produced the tape for the president.
   The White House worked Wednesday on adding Arab subtitles and
audio translation to the tape before sending it to the Iraqi
ambassador via Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   The Voice of America said in a statement that it was doing the
translating before the tape is handed over ``to forestall any
excuses for not using the tape.''
   Fitzwater said although there had been no direct contact between
the two governments regarding the videotape, ``We expect that Iraq
will honor its invitation to allow this to be addressed to the
Iraqi people, and we will ask them to provide us an air time within
the next five days.''
   He told reporters that the White House will release the tape to
the media after it is aired, or after five days if the Iraqis do
not show it.
   Bush made the tape after the Iraq government offered to sent a
TV crew to interview him and broadcast the interview on national
television. He opted to make his own tape instead of submit to an
interview.
   He taped the message at 7:30 a.m. in the Oval Office, standing
in front of his desk and reading from a TelePrompTer.
   ``Essentially it repeats some of the themes that the president
expressed last night, particularly that we have no quarrel with the
Iraqi people, that the Iraqi government has forced incredible
hardships on the people of Iraq by virtue of the naked aggression
against Kuwait,'' said Fitzwater.
   Asked if Bush used any of the harsh rhetoric against President
Saddam Hussein that he has used for domestic consumption, Fitzwater
said the message was ``personal and it's directed toward the people
of Iraq and the hardship they've had to bear in this matter.''
   He said Saddam is mentioned in the tape, but it the message is
not an attack on the Iraqi leader.
   The Iraqi government offered Bush TV time after the president
stated publicly that he would like to have the access to the Iraqi
people that Saddam Hussein has had on U.S. TV networks.
   Saddam Hussein's news conferences and appearances with hostages
have been widely aired, often live and in full, on TV news programs
in the United states.
   Fitzwater said he anticipated ``broad international interest''
in Bush's message.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's airlines, saying they already
face losses of billions of dollars because of soaring fuel prices,
appealed Wednesday to federal budget negotiators to reject calls
for higher aviation taxes.
   ``Higher tax rates would depress consumer demand for air travel,
depress airline earnings and depress government tax receipts, all
in one fell swoop,'' Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air
Transport Association, said in a letter to the negotiators.
   Aaronson said that since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
gasoline prices have risen 30 cents to 90 cents a gallon.
   Every penny increase adds $150 million to annual industry
operating expenses, he said.
   ``If fuel prices stay above 90 cents a gallon, and demand for
air services remains soft, the industry will lose an estimated
$1.25 billion this year and possibly $2 billion over the next two
quarters,'' Aaronson said.
   Including an aviation tax in a federal deficit reduction package
would have ``severe financial consequences,'' he said.
   Airlines have been slow to raise prices to cover the rapid rise
in fuel prices because they fear they would lose customers,
Aaronson said, adding that demand for air service already is weak
because the U.S. economy is on the edge of a recession.

   More than 650,000 cans of French corned
beef ``full of hair'' and ``other dirty and smelly stuff'' were
recalled from refugee camps along the border with Iraq, officials
said Wednesday.
   The United Nations Relief and Works Agency had delivered the
donated food to the refugee camps. The camps are home to at least
50,000 foreigners, mostly Asians, who have been stranded here since
fleeing Iraq and Kuwait after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Health Minister Mohammad Adoub Al-Zaben said the cans of corned
beef, delivered Monday, had ``to be immediately trashed because
laboratory tests proved they were unfit for consumption.''
   He refused to say who made the donation, but reporters who saw
the shipment read on the cans: ``Not for Sale. Gift of the European
Economic Community.''
   Al-Zaben said the shipment was originally directed to the 1.2
million Palestinian refugees who have been living in Jordan for
years. But the U.N. agency suggested the food be diverted to the
more recent refugees.
   ``The food is polluted,'' Al-Zaben said. ``Anybody who looks at
the cans would not accept to eat what is inside it. It is full of
hair and other dirty and smelly stuff.''
   Apparently no one at the camps ate any of the beef, Al-Zaben
said.
   The minister said the food ``was not old or expired, but it is
just not fit for consumption.''
   To ensure the health safety of the refugees, he ``instructed all
concerned authorities to inspect any food donations before they are
distributed'' for refugees, Al-Zaben said.
   Previously, 10 tons of dates donated by Egypt had to be returned
because they were too hard to chew.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Charged in Fire at Socialist Party Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior opposition leader has been
indicted in connection with a fire set by demonstrators at the
Socialist Party headquarters, the state news agency BTA said
Wednesday.
   Konstantin Trenchev, leader of the Podkrepa independent labor
confederation, was charged for his role in the Aug. 26 blaze, BTA
said.
   Trenchev caused embarrassment in the ranks of the opposition
Union of Democratic Forces after witnesses quoted him as saying a
group of supporters would attack the party headquarters unless the
Socialists removed the red Communist star from atop the building.
The fire was set the same night.
   Alexander Lilov, chairman of the successor party to the
Communists, subsequently accused ``hawks in the opposition'' with
masterminding the fire.
   The charge against Trenchev was announced by Sofia's prosecutor,
Borislav Yotov.
   Trenchev denied wrongdoing, saying his comments were taken out
of context.
   BTA also reported criminal charges have been filed against
Plamen Stanchev, a member of the Civil Disobedience group who
threatened to set himself on fire if the Stalinist symbols were not
removed from public buildings.
   He was charged with draft evasion and ``besmirching'' the state
flag, BTA said. It did not elaborate on the charges.
   Witnesses said Stanchev poured what appeared to be a flammable
substance over himself just before the building was set ablaze, but
was prevented by bystanders from lighting a match.
   Twenty people have been charged so far for complicity in the
fire, and 11 of them are under arrest, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
   The attack on the building was a reflection of dissent with the
Socialists, who won democratic elections in June, but have since
been increasingly blamed for the country's growing economic crisis.
   Trenchev was subsequently barred from traveling abroad, and
Podkrepa said the restrictions were imposed under an article of the
passport law applied to persons whose departure would threaten the
national interest.
   Trenchev planned to attend trade union congresses in Paris and
Vienna later this month.

<HEAD>Police Discover Filmed `Murder' Really Rock Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious ``murder'' film turned out to be no
mystery at all when police discovered the evidence was really a
rock music video.
   The film, found in a movie camera lying in a Michigan cornfield
last year, shows Trent Reznor, lead singer for the Cleveland rock
group Nine Inch Nails, lying face up in an ally on Chicago's North
Side.
   Chicago police Detective Hal Ardell said Tuesday the rock group
made the film last September using 8mm movie cameras held aloft
with helium balloons for some of the scenes. But a tether broke and
the balloons carried one of the cameras to a cornfield 125 miles
away, near Burr Oak, Mich.
   The farmer who found the camera turned it over to Michigan State
Police, who developed the film and sent a copy to Chicago police.
   Pathologists at the Cook County medical examiner's office said
it appeared Reznor was dead. But Ardell said it was starch powder
placed on Reznor's face that gave him the deathly look.
   Inquiries at college film departments turned up a former Art
Institute of Chicago student who said his employer, H-GUN Video
Productions, had been hired by a New York firm to produce a music
video for Nine Inch Nails. The man explained how the camera broke
loose.
   ``The bottom line is we don't have a body and we don't have
mystery or homicide,'' said John Townsend, chief of detectives of
the Chicago Police Department.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city seems to be getting over a civic
identity crisis that was touched off by the slaying of a young
tourist. Some New Yorkers hope that the long, violent summer might
yet prove a turning point in the fight against crime.
   The optimists are led by the family of Brian Watkins, who was
knifed to death last week while trying to defend his parents from
muggers.
   In a letter in Wednesday's New York Times, the family from
Provo, Utah, said they bore no hard feelings toward the city or its
people.
   ``We know that New York is sometimes depicted as a cold and
heartless city, but we have found the opposite to be true,'' they
said. They thanked New Yorkers ``who called, sent flowers and
cards. ...
   ``New York has been the site of many pleasant and fun memories
for our family,'' they wrote. ``We only hope that this experience
will make New York City a better place for others to enjoy. ... It
is our hope that Brian did not die for nothing.''
   About 1,500 people, including Mayor David Dinkins, signed a
2-by-3 foot condolence card for the family. The card, which has 15
sheets of paper, was created by co-workers at a Manhattan real
estate office who stood on the street to collect signatures.
   There were other signs of hope:
   _ Gov. Mario Cuomo supported Dinkins' plans to hire more police,
and promised to send 100 state troopers to the city.
   _ Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger unveiled ``We're
Making it Shine,'' a campaign to boost civic pride with stickers
and buttons, good citizen awards, and small cash grants to
community groups fighting crime.
   ``This is the greatest, most complex, most exciting metropolis
in the world,'' said Messinger. ``We also have monumental problems
_ not the least of which is the crisis in confidence.''
   _ A convicted drug dealer, out of jail on a work program, helped
catch two chain-snatchers on a subway.
   The inmate was riding the train back to the Rikers Island jail
when a gang of four men surrounded a woman and snatched a chain
from her neck.
   The man jumped up and chased the gang through the car and out of
the station. Two police officers in the next car also gave chase,
and two men were arrested.
   The city's fortunes seemed to hit bottom Monday when Time
magazine appeared with a cover story on ``The Rotting of the Big
Apple'' and a poll saying that most New Yorkers would move out if
they could.
   City officials countered Tuesday with some responses from the
same poll that Time had not reported: 70 percent agreed New York
was the greatest city in the world and 78 percent thought the
opportunities in the city were unmatched anywhere.
   And on Wednesday another magazine, House &amp; Garden, appeared with
an issue on New York weighted heavily toward a more gracious side
of local life.
   The cover, which features a $6 million view of the skyline from
the terrace of a Central Park West penthouse, promises ``Tom Wolfe
on the Perfectly Crafted Town House'' and ``Gloria Steinem on
Decorating Her Apartment.''
   The surest sign the city was regaining its stride was found in
the tabloids. Native son Jim Dwyer, writing in New York Newsday,
pointed out all the good things that were done or made in the city
the day Watkins died, from pop music to Irish soda bread.
   Fellow columnist Sheryl McCarthy admitted she finds the city so
difficult that she backed out of a deal to buy a co-op, but still
can't bring herself to leave because she doesn't know any place
better.
   ``As I and other New Yorkers search for another place to go, we
must do something to make this city better,'' she wrote. ``We have
no other choice.''
   There were even signs that the old feistiness was coming back.
   ``New York, Dead?'' asked a headline in the Daily News. ``It's a
Lot Better than Iowa, Alive.''

   It'll take more than three coins in a fountain to
get water spurting at Miami's Bayfront Park. City officials want to
install a credit card slot that would charge gawkers $21 an hour
for the privilege.
   Miami's City Commission discussed the idea Tuesday after
learning that operating the $3.15 million Claude and Mildred Pepper
Fountain costs $42 an hour, and the city has no money in the budget
for it after Oct. 1.
   ``Any scheme that helps us pay for running a fountain and gets
tourists more interested in the park is fine by me,'' said Mayor
Xavier Suarez.
   The idea for a teller-like machine at the fountain, named after
the late congressman and his wife, was suggested by a contracting
company that offered to build the device to help defray the cost.
   ``To our knowledge this is a unique concept,'' said Francisco
Farach, president of Edd Helms Electrical Contracting Inc.
   Suarez asked if the machine would accept quarters for shorter
periods. Farach said no, but added that it could take $5 or $10
bills.
   The commission took no final action on the project.

<TEXT>
   The activity known as bungee-jumping
was banned Wednesday after two people were injured when one of the
cords attached to their feet broke free, leaving them dangling with
their heads just above water.
   Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss Australia ended Monday,
suffered a broken collarbone when she and a staff member of the
Bungee Bats group plunged 130 feet.
   John Fahey, the New South Wales industrial relations minister,
said the sport was banned until a report was completed on the
accident. It was not immediately clear whether jumps would be
allowed elsewhere in Australia.
   Ms. McCurry made a successful solo jump from a cage suspended by
a crane off Sydney's Birkenhead Point. She then took a tandem
plunge with crew member Andy Gulby.
   They had their arms wrapped around each other, and elastic cords
attached to their ankles were supposed to stop their fall a couple
of yards above the water. One of the cords broke free from the
cage, leaving only the other to support the couple's combined
weight.
   They hit the water and went under before the remaining cord
stretched back. Then they dangled upside down for several minutes
with their heads just above the surface.
   An ambulance spokesman said they were treated for neck and back
injuries and taken to nearby Balmain hospital.
   Bungee Bats director Wayne Page said all regular safety checks
had taken place before the pair jumped. He said the jumpers had
gone through the usual weigh-ins and that the cords used had a
tension to match their combined weight so they would not hit the
water.
   ``We don't really know what caused the problem,'' he said.
   Bungee Bats began public jumps in Sydney last month after a
three-month battle with the Department of Industrial Relations over
safety concerns. The department granted approval after tightening
safety standards, which included shortening cords to ensure jumpers
did not enter the water.
   Participants pay $56 per jump.
   One fatality and another serious injury have been reported in
New Zealand, where the activity got its commercial start two years
ago.
   France banned the activity after an elastic cord gave way and a
man plunged to his death from a 180-foot crane at a festival in
eastern France in June 1989.It was legalized again last October
after rules were established. Under them, jumpers must undergo
heart exams; elastic bands must be changed every 150 jumps; and the
number of jumps per hour for each set of elastic bands must be
limited.

<TEXT>
   Four bank offices in Bastia were bombed
early Wednesday, and a caller claimed responsibility on behalf of a
nationalist guerrilla group, police and news reports said.
   There were no injuries and damage was slight, they said.
   The bombs exploded in quick succession about 2 a.m. at branches
of four different banks in and near Bastia in northern Corsica.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said a man later
telephoned its local office to claim responsibility on behalf of
the Corsican National Liberation Army.
   Similar claims were made last weekend in which vacation homes in
southern Corsica were bombed.
   Police investigators have said they are unsure whether the
Corsican National Liberation Army is a new, distinct group, or a
splinter faction of the Corsican National Liberation Front, for
many years the main pro-independence guerrilla group on the French
island.
   At each bombing site, the attackers have painted an ``R.'' The
caller reportedly said this signified ``revolt.''
   According to AFP, the caller said the banks ``don't serve the
Corsican people. They were established to assist the colonialists,
whatever their nationality.''
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe described the bombers as ``a few
desperados.'' He said they apparently were upset at political
developments aimed at reconciling Corsican demands for more
automony.

<HEAD>NASA Replaces Crushed Seal, Next Launch Attempt Tuesday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crushed seal that escaped
repeated checks of Columbia's leaking rear compartment has been
replaced, and a confident NASA set Tuesday as the date for the
shuttle's fourth launch attempt.
   Engineers initially believed one of Columbia's three
recirculation pumps leaked during fueling last week for NASA's
third attempt to send the shuttle on an astronomy mission. The
crushed seal was discovered Tuesday as technicians checked the
newly installed pumps.
   NASA spokesman James Hartsfield said Wednesday the seal
apparently was damaged when it was installed improperly after
Columbia's last flight in January. The Teflon seal, about 2{ inches
in diameter, is part of a valve on a hydrogen line that leads to
one of the shuttle's three main rocket engines.
   ``They feel extremely confident that's what stopped our show
last time,'' Hartsfield said. ``They think they've cured it. It's a
great thing to be able to say.''
   NASA has been trying to send Columbia on an astronomy mission
since May, when the shuttle's hydrogen leaks first were detected.
The space agency replaced the hydrogen lines between the orbiter
and external tank, and made minor repairs in the aft compartment.
   The new components did not leak during fueling for Thursday's
launch attempt. But hydrogen flooded the rear compartment, where
the pumps and three main engines are located.
   Tests of the pumps that were removed found only minor leakage,
and that could not account for the amount of hydrogen that filled
the compartment, Hartsfield said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has only a few
days next week in which to launch Columbia with seven astronauts
and a $150 million observatory called Astro. After that, the flight
will have to wait until after Discovery's top-priority mission to
send a satellite on a five-year journey to study the sun's polar
regions.
   The space agency on Wednesday targeted Oct. 8 as a launch date
for Discovery, although officials said that could change by a few
days either way depending on flight preparations. Discovery must
lift off by Oct. 23, otherwise the $750 million mission will have
to be delayed until 1991 when Earth is aligned properly again with
the sun and Jupiter.
   The plutonium-powered sun probe, called Ulysses, will use
Jupiter's strong gravitational field as a slingshot back to the
sun. It will be the first spacecraft to orbit over the sun's poles.
   Discovery's five astronauts, in interviews at Johnson Space
Center on Wednesday, said they have full confidence in NASA and
their shuttle. Discovery is the only spaceship in which a hydrogen
leak has not been detected.
   Nonetheless, ``we're all going to be anxious and be watching our
tanking a few hours before launch,'' said astronaut Tom Akers.
``We're keeping our fingers crossed.''
   Two of Columbia's three launch scrubs occurred during fueling
five to six hours before liftoff. Problems with one of four
telescopes inside the cargo bay accounted for the second failed
launch attempt.
   Atlantis' leaks were discovered when hydrogen was pumped into
the shuttle during a tanking test in June.
   NASA has not launched a shuttle since April, when Discovery was
sent into space with the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope
later was found to have a mirror that was manufactured with a
serious flaw, preventing sharp focusing.
   Discovery astronaut Bruce Melnick attributes NASA's trouble with
Hubble and leaking shuttles to ``an unusual string of bad luck.''
   ``It's a shame that we've had our poor batting average here over
the summer,'' Melnick said. ``It's time we started launching
shuttles again.''

<TEXT>
   A Senate committee Wednesday endorsed a
five-year extension of the National Endowment for the Arts, but
with a demand that grant recipients convicted of violating
obscenity laws forfeit their federal subsidies within 90 days of
the conviction.
   The bill was approved 15-1, with strong bipartisan support, and
sent to the full Senate after the committee resoundingly defeated a
proposal by Sen. Dan Coates, R-Ind., that would have imposed much
stricter anti-obscenity curbs on the federal arts agency.
   The bill includes $175 million in spending authority for the
endowment next year, the same amount requested by the White House.
In the House, a subcommittee has voted to boost the NEA's current
$171 million budget to $180 million in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
   The Senate compromise was drafted by a coalition of liberals and
conservatives on the committee, including the chairman, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and the ranking Republican, Sen. Orrin Hatch
of Utah.
   Arts supporters predicted that the Senate bill's broad,
bipartisan support in the committee will heighten its chances of
passage by the full chamber. The fate of similar legislation in the
House was clouded by bitter political wrangling over the ``obscene
art'' issue.
   The NEA's statutory authority expires Sept. 30. Lapsing on the
same day will be a congressional ban on NEA support for artistic
and literary works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including
depictions of homoeroticism, sadomasochism, individuals engaged in
sex acts and sexual exploitation of children.
   The anti-obscenity ban was enacted in October at the urging of
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who led a conservative assault on the NEA
for supporting exhibitions of works by photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano that critics charged were
pornographic and sacrilegious.
   Hatch said the Senate compromise would take the NEA out of the
business of determining what is obscene, and would leave those
decisions to the courts.
   The bill would require repayment of federal grant money awarded
to artists or arts organizations convicted of violating obscenity
and child pornography laws. Convicted grant recipients would be
forbidden to receive further NEA grants for three years or until
their funds are repaid, whichever is longer.
   Coates, the lone dissenter, said the bill didn't go far enough
to halt what he called NEA support for ``filth'' and ``garbage''
that is ``profoundly offensive to the majority of the American
people.''
   He proposed imposing guidelines on NEA panels that select grant
applications for approval, forbidding them to approve works that
violate the Supreme Court's obscenity standards, involve child
pornography or attack historic religious figures, tenets or symbols.
   Coates' amendment was defeated on a 14-2 vote after Kennedy said
it probably would be held unconstitutional as a form of prior
restraint on grant recipients, and would ``have a chilling effect
on the arts.''
   Coates was supported only by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who
then voted in favor of the committee compromise and predicted it
would provoke ``a terrible fight on the floor'' of the Senate.
   The Senate bill made no mention of a proposal pushed by NEA
reformers in the House that would shift the bulk of the endowment's
grant money _ as much as 60 percent _ to the control of state arts
agencies.

   The phone rings constantly in the
offices of Saudi officials dealing with Kuwaiti refugees. Another
call often means another demand.
   One man in a regular hotel room wanted a luxury suite. Another
wanted $3,000 for car repairs. Both requests were denied.
   Officials are still looking into a refugee's plea to move from
his 12th-floor apartment to a lower level.
   While the Jordanian government struggles with about 50,000
impoverished Asian refugees who fled after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait, the Saudis face a different challenge in coping with up
to 100,000 displaced Kuwaits, many accustomed to a privileged
lifestyle.
   ``They think of themselves as guests,'' said one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Besides the problems of sheer numbers, Saudi officials also
confront conservative families not used to living outside the
privacy of villa walls. Meanwhile, Saudis try to tone down the
grandiose expectations of one of the richest refugee populations in
history.
   ``They all want accomodation and financial help,'' said Prince
Fahd bin Salam on Wednesday. ``If I was going to see all the
Kuwaitis, I would have to see 1,000 per day.''
   There is extra pressure on the Kuwaiti women, many of whom have
never traveled much outside their homes before.
   One Kuwaiti woman dressed completely in black, with her face
shrouded, pointed an angry finger at a tape recorder carried by a
reporter.
   ``Turn it off! Turn it off!'' she yelled, retreating into a
corner. She was later told the music was spewing out of the
elevator's loudspeaker.
   The government is seeking to move people into about 2,000 empty
apartments built in skyscrapers for low-income Saudis but never
claimed.
   But 16,000 refugees remain in schools in the Eastern Province,
and officials fear classes may be delayed up to a month if the
refugees are not moved by the start of the session in two weeks,
Prince Salman said.
   Saudi Arabia is paying for food, housing and laundry for the
refugees in the kingdom, many in luxury hotels. Private caterers
churn out 20,000 meals a day to those families that don't want to
cook.
   So far, Saudi officials have not released the cost of caring for
the refugees.
   The deposed government of Kuwait announced this week that it
would take over the expenses of the refugees, paying each family a
salary.
   Married couples will get about $300 dollars a month each plus up
to $150 per child.
   The money will be distributed through refugee committees, who
are trying to help Kuwaitis who fled without any papers proving
their citizenship.
   One corner of a parking garage in a 12-story building in Damman
has been converted into a mosque.
   Kuwaitis also flock to daily sessions held by the ruling
princes, a sort of government complaints service where they listen
to individual problems.
   One Sudanese man showed up at the province offices Monday and
used the public audience to say he was destitute and needed a
ticket home. Prince Fahd assured him he would get it.

   Democratic challenger Joseph E. Brennan's
campaign says it ``embarrassed'' Maine's Republican governor into
ordering salary freezes for top administration officials.
   But Gov. John R. McKernan dismissed that assertion, saying the
move had been under consideration since last spring.
   McKernan on Tuesday ordered a freeze of a scheduled 3 percent
pay increase for top Executive Department officials. He said the
order ``sends a signal that state government is tightening its
belt.''
   Barbara Reinertsen, a spokeswoman for Brennan, said McKernan's
action came in response to a suggestion Brennan made during a
televised debate last week.
   ``We're declaring success,'' she said. ``Congressman Brennan
embarrassed McKernan into making this freeze.''
   State finances have become a central issue in the gubernatorial
campaign. Brennan, a former governor seeking to make a comeback,
has accused McKernan of mismanaging state finances. McKernan,
meanwhile, defends his administration's responses to the economic
slowdown in the Northeast.

   Abortion rights activists say they plan
to use a phone campaign aimed at Iowa women to help defeat GOP Gov.

November.
   Women between the ages of 25 and 45 who are registered as

can get them to the polls.''
   The phone campaign will be launched in separate projects
sponsored by the action league and the Freedom Fund of Planned

   Bierkamp said callers will tell the women that Tauke is opposed
to abortion rights but that his opponent, Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin, is pro-choice. They also will tell women that Branstad is
opposed to abortion rights but that his Democratic rival, Don
Avenson, favors them.
   ``The entire project, of course, is to defeat Tauke and
Branstad,'' she said.
   Both races are considered competitive matchups.

   Sen. Jim Exon of Nebraska said he stands by

   In a letter last week, the president of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee asked Exon to apologize for making
the remarks at an August fund-raiser.
   Albert Mokhiber said Arab-Americans recently have been subjected
to an alarming increase of anti-Arab bigotry, threats and violence.
   Democrat Exon said Tuesday that he didn't believe there was
anything to apologize for. In a written reply to Mokhiber, Exon
said his remarks had concerned ``parts'' of the Arab world, not all
Arabs.
   ``My view is that there is indeed less concern today and respect
for human life in parts of the Arab world than elsewhere,'' Exon
wrote. ``Without question this is true with some of the leadership,
by warring factions in several places and by obvious government
policy in other tragic events.''
   He added: ``I am saddened to learn of any threats or violence
against American Arabs. I condemn this and it is not of my doing. I
do not support bigotry.''
   Exon had said at the August fund-raiser: ``In the Arab world,
force and force of arms is the only thing they understand. ... In
the Arab world, human life is not as important as it is in the
non-Arab world.'' He added: ``I don't mean all Arabs are bad, and I
don't want to disdain Arabs as a whole.''

   Chaotic violence raged
Wednesday through black townships, where armed gangs set fire to
homes and chased people through the streets. Police said at least
50 people were killed.
   It was some of the worst unrest in a month of black faction
fighting in townships near Johannesburg. More than 700 people have
died.
   People piled possessions in wheelbarrows and supermarket carts
to flee clashes between groups armed with machetes, axes, spears
and clubs in the black townships.
   ``We have to leave. We are helpless without guns,'' said one man
who refused to give his name.
   Ambushes in Soweto killed a white policeman and three blacks,
while street fighting killed 46 blacks in four other townships,
police said.
   Later in the day, police reported four black men in a van opened
fire with an AK-47 assault rifle on passersby in downtown
Johannesburg, killing at least three blacks. The independent South
African Press Association said 10 people were wounded.
   Officers fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse crowds in
Vosloorus and Soweto. Houses and cars were set alight, and charred
corpses remained on the street in several areas.
   ``The Zulus are killing us,'' said one man at the Tokoza
squatter camp, who was carrying an ax. ``Every night they come with
guns.''
   A resident of the Katlehong township told the South African
Press Association that youths attacked a train there Wednesday
night, setting three wagons on fire. The man, Muzi Mango, told the
news agency that he heard gunshots and people screaming.
   Police said they had no report of such an attack.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela discussed the
violence Tuesday with President F.W. de Klerk and called for the
military to end the fighting. Mandela and other black leaders have
been unable to bring peace, despite repeated pleas. They have
accused police of fueling the fighting and allege that whites with
blackened faces or wearing masks have joined in the attacks.
   The fighting involves Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement and Xhosas and other blacks linked to the ANC. It began
Aug. 12 in Johannesburg-area townships after spreading from Natal
Province in the east. Natal is the traditional Zulu homeland.
   ANC supporters have charged that much of the recent fighting
began with Inkatha attacks on squatter camps and other dwellings.
   A senior police official said sending more security forces to
the townships could control the violence, but would fail to address
its root causes.
   ``I think we can only put the lid on,'' Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler
told Radio 702. ``The pot is still boiling.''
   The latest victims included a police officer and three
colleagues who were ambushed with assault rifles while driving
through a squatter camp in Soweto. The policeman was killed and the
others were seriously injured.
   Police said the ambushed patrol went to the camp after ANC
leader Walter Sisulu told them Tuesday night that Inkatha was
attacking residents. Police Brig. Gen. Vic Haynes said Sisulu's
report proved false but that the quick police response showed the
force was not siding with Inkatha.
   ``We do not at all say that Mr. Sisulu deliberately led the
policemen into an ambush,'' Haynes added.
   Also in Soweto, three blacks died when their yellow van was
riddled with gunfire from AK-47 rifles, police said. The attackers
apparently mistook the van for a police vehicle, most of which are
yellow.
   The government sent troops into the townships last month to back
up police, but fighting didn't stop. Mandela said Tuesday the
government could stop the fighting if it wanted to by using its
powerful military.
   He also said the continued unrest threatened talks with the
white-led government on ending apartheid. Mandela has made similar
statements in the past, but the talks have continued.
   Both Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid but differ over
tactics and plans for a future South Africa. Inkatha accuses the
ANC of trying to monopolize power by terrorizing political
opponents. The ANC says Inkatha spread the violence from Natal in a
bid to broaden its constituency.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha, in a letter to the United
Nations, called for international pressure to get Mandela and
Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to join forces in seeking an
end to the fighting. The ANC has so far rejected contact with
Buthelezi.
   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded overnight at a governing National
Party office in Pretoria. No one was injured. A man who identified
himself as a member of an extreme right-wing group claimed
responsibility in a telephone call to a Johannesburg radio station.
   Right-wing groups oppose de Klerk's efforts to end apartheid,
the system of racial segregation that denies blacks a voice in
national affairs.

<HEAD>Former Congressman, Klan Official Rejected in Maryland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former congressman wanted to resurrect a
disgraced political career. A Ku Klux Klan official hoped to begin
one. Both found Maryland voters to be an unsympathetic audience.
   Charles Diggs Jr., who represented Michigan for 25 years in the
House of Representatives, lost a bid Tuesday to become a member of
the Maryland legislature. He ran next to last among 10 candidates
for the Democratic nomination for three seats in the House of
Delegates.
   Diggs operates a funeral home in the Maryland suburbs of
Washington, D. C. He left Congress in 1980 after the Supreme Court
refused to hear an appeal of his conviction on 29 counts of mail
fraud and skimming $66,000 from his staffers' padded paychecks.
   The Democrat claimed he was a victim of selective prosecution
and double standards. Diggs, who is black, maintained that position
through his trial and a lengthy congressional inquiry that ended
with a formal censure.
   Roger Kelly, Grand Dragon of the Maryland Ku Klux Klan, did even
worse than Diggs. He finished last in a field of 16 candidates
seeking the Democratic nomination for five seats on the Frederick
County Council. Kelly got just under 1.5 percent of the vote.
   Kelly, who works at a brick company just a few miles from Camp
David, the presidential retreat in the mountains of western
Maryland, did not make an issue of his Klan membership, but he
didn't deny it.
   A former Klan member, Edgar Harris, also finished last in a
Frederick County race. He got 1.38 percent of the vote in a losing
bid for election to the county's Democratic central committee.

<HEAD>Donor Makes Possible Five Organ Transplants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As a young boy, Valdies Doss ran into a burning
building to save a neighbor child. At his death, the 29-year-old
man donated organs for transplants that saved five more lives.
   ``He loved people, he helped people all the time,'' his mother,
Marva Odister, said Wednesday.
   Her son suffered fatal head injuries in a traffic accident
Friday. Doctors approached her about the organ donations.
   Surgical teams from four states flew to Detroit Receiving
Hospital late Saturday and worked until 5 a.m. Sunday to remove
Doss' heart, lungs, pancreas, kidneys and liver, hospital
spokeswoman Diane Cuper said.
   They also saved his eyes, skin and many bones and veins, Cuper
said.
   It was the first time such a procedure had been performed in
Michigan and one of only a few times nationally, doctors said.
   At stake was the gift of life, said Dr. Emanuel Reinitz, chief
of transplantation at Detroit Medical Center who headed the team.
   A patient awaiting a heart transplant has an 80 percent chance
of survival if a donor of the proper organ size and blood type is
found, Reinitz said.
   At any time, 1,200 to 1,500 people nationally are awaiting heart
transplants and 17,000 await kidney transplants, the doctor added.
   ``These are precious, precious things. That's why there's all
these communications going back and forth and these teams flying
back and forth when this happens,'' he said.
   Doss' heart was given to a 40-year-old St. Louis man who had
been waiting two years for a transplant. His liver went to a
40-year-old Richmond, Va., man, and a 38-year-old Minnesota man has
Doss' left lung.
   Both of his kidneys went to Michigan women, Cuper said.
   ``The number of patients that have benefited from this one
donation is what's so exciting,'' said Gerda Lipcaman, executive
director of the Organ Procurement Agency of Michigan. ``The heart
recipient, the liver recipient, the lung recipient _ they have no
recourse. They either get a transplant or they die.''
   Doss was struck by a van Friday night as he left his job as a
cook at the Van Dyke Park Hotel in suburban Warren.
   Doss hadn't married, his mother said. ``He never had any kids.
This way, he's helping somebody,'' she said.

<HEAD>Corn Crop at 4-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are harvesting a bumper corn crop
estimated at a four-year high of 8.12 billion bushels, up 8 percent
from last year's crop and 3 percent more than forecast a month ago,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Last year's corn harvest was 7.53 billion bushels, and the
department in its initial forecast Aug. 9 put this fall's harvest
at 7.85 billion bushels.
   ``Above-normal temperatures the last of August accelerated
development (of the corn crop), but it still lagged behind normal
in most of the major producing states,'' said the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board.
   By Sept. 2, only about 7 percent of the corn acreage was mature,
19 percentage points was behind normal, although harvest had begun
as far north as Kentucky.
   The September estimate of 8.12 billion bushels would be the
largest corn output since 8.23 billion bushels were harvested in
1986.
   Based on early September surveys, corn yields were estimated at
121.7 bushels per acre harvested, compared with 116.2 last year and
117.7 indicated last month. The record is 119.4 bushels in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent this year.
   The huge corn harvest, along with bumper wheat yields, will help
cushion against sharp food price increases in 1991.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.83 billion bushels, down 5 percent from
last year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels and virtually unchanged
from the August estimate.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.7 million bales, up 21
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales but down 1
percent from the August forecast.
   The September report showed total 1990 wheat production at 2.76
billion bushels, up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest and up 2
percent from last month's estimate. Average yields, at 39.4 bushels
per acre, equal the record high of 1983.
   The department's all-crops production index was reported at 112
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison. That is the
highest reading since the index averaged 116 percent in 1985.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1990-91 marketing year, which
began Sept. 1, is expected to be about 8.075 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production, that will
mean a small increase in U.S. corn stockpiles to about 1.375
billion bushels left over by Sept. 1, 1991.
   A month ago, with a smaller harvest expected, analyst expected
the corn stockpile to decline in the coming year.
   Despite the modest upturn, it is a sharp turnaround from last
season's decline, when it plummeted from 4.26 billion bushels on
Sept. 1, 1988 to 1.93 billion bushels on hand last Sept. 1.
   The report said U.S. corn prices may average in the range of
$2.10 to $2.50 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, down 25
cents from the August projection. Corn prices at the farm averaged
about $2.38 per bushel last season.
   With larger-than-expected wheat production, the stockpile at the
end of the 1990-91 marketing year next June is expected to be 946
million bushels, 100 million bushels more than forecast in August
and almost double the 535 million bushels carried over June 1.
   As a result of the larger wheat supply, prices at the farm are
expected to decline to an average of $2.55 to $2.85 per bushel this
marketing year from $3.72 in 1989-90.
   Soybean prices at the farm were forecast at $5.50 to $7 per
bushel in 1990-91, compared with $5.70 the past marketing year.
That was unchanged from the August forecast.
   Other 1990 crop estimates based on Sept. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 572.4 million bushels and an average yield of 61.8
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   _Rice, 159 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,641 pounds per
acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   _Peanuts, 3.56 billion pounds and a yield of 2,043 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   _Tobacco, 1.55 billion pounds and a yield of 2,127 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   _Sugar beets, 27.3 million tons and a yield of 19.9 tons per
acre, compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   _Sugar cane, 24.7 million tons and a yield of 34.9 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

   An outbreak of anthrax in
Kruger National Park has killed more than 200 animals, including
buffalo, impala, jackals, lions and elephants, the park's head of
research said.
   Vossie de Vos told the South African Broadcasting Co. on Tuesday
that an innoculation campaign had started against the disease. The
last major anthrax outbreak in the huge game park in northeastern
South Africa was in 1970.
   Anthrax is caused by tiny flesh-eating flies that lodge in the
wounds of animals and lay eggs. The disease can be transmitted to
humans, but can be halted by washing the wounds.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday praised
German unification as the first modern merger of a nation without
war and suffering.
   Germans in the East and West hailed the historic signing of the
unification pact in Moscow as the end of the postwar era.
   There was none of the euphoria that greeted the opening of the
Berlin Wall 10 months ago, however.
   Most East Germans now are more concerned about soaring
unemployment. West Germans have become upset over the costs of
unification, and many are worried about possible tax increases.
   The only negative voices in Germany came from the powerful
lobbying group of Germans thrown out of Eastern Europe after World
War II.
   The Federation of Expellees clings to hopes of one day regaining
lands forfeited to Warsaw after World War II, and it objects to the
formal recognition of Poland's present western border.
   A protest also was lodged by a Jewish leader in Israel who
condemned the treaty for failing to mention the Nazi Holocaust, in
which 6 million Jews were killed during World War II.
   With the treaty signing, Germans have been guaranteed full
rights over their own united country 45 years after it went down in
flames.
   ``World War II is truly over,'' the ARD television network
commented shortly after the signing. ``These signatures
re-establish the sovereignty of a united Germany.''
   The four World War II powers that defeated and carved up Nazi
Germany signed the treaty with the two German states. It approves
of their unification and heralds the return of full sovereignty.
   In Bonn, Kohl said Wednesday was ``another key date on the way
to German unity.''
   ``This is the first unification of a country in modern history
that is taking place without war, suffering and disputes that cause
new bitterness,'' he said in a written statement.
   While the recent rush to unification has been amicable, the road
has been long. The division of Germany was filled with
world-threatening tensions between the late 1940s and the 1960s,
when the superpowers struggled over Berlin.
   ARD television showed dramatic film clips of the German
separation as part of its report on Wednesday's historic signing.
   Germans also saw, as they have many times before, film clips of
the Berlin Wall being built in 1961 and President Kennedy giving
his famous ``ich bin ein Berliner'' speech.
   The more recent shots showed a smiling Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev chatting amicably with Kohl.
   ARD noted that Gorbachev's policies and the end of the East-West
conflict ``cleared the way for German unity and the normalization
of Soviet-German relations.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and their French, British and German
counterparts signed the treaty in the plush Oktyabrskaya Hotel.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the
treaty signing was ``a day of joy and jubilation'' for Germans, but
that the victims of World War II and the Nazi terror must never be
forgotten. He also noted the ``agony of the Jewish people'' and
said it must never be repeated.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi
Pazner, said he hoped that the united Germany would adopt ``the
same friendliness and cooperation with Israel as has West Germany
through all these years.''
   But Matityahu Drobles, chairman of the Israeli wing of the World
Jewish Congress, sent a protest letter to the West German Embassy
in Tel Aviv because the treaty did not mention the Holocaust.
   ``The fact that Germany totally ignores its basic moral
obligation already at the beginning of the unification should be a
warning light to the Jewish nation and to humanity as a whole,''
said Drobles, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon's spokesman labeled ``simply
wrong'' a newspaper report Wednesday that said the Illinois
Democrat made several calls on behalf of a political supporter who
owed a thrift millions of dollars.
   The Chicago Sun-Times said it obtained internal government memos
that questioned Simon's phone calls to First Nationwide Financial
Corp. of San Francisco.
   Simon, a frequent critic of the government's handling of the
savings and loan crisis, has acknowledged making only one call on
behalf of Stephen Ballis, a Chicago developer who defaulted on a
loan once held by Pathway Financial. The savings and loan failed
and was taken over by First Nationwide in a rescue that was aided
by public tax dollars.
   The newspaper said it obtained a memo to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation's legislative affairs office that was written
by the FDIC's James Tenney.
   ``One call to get the story is understandable, but five-six
calls seems highly inappropriate,'' Tenney said in the Aug. 2 memo,
according to the Sun-Times. ``We thought you should be aware of
this type of contact.''
   ``The memo is simply wrong. It's untrue,'' Simon spokesman David
Carle said. ``They were playing phone tag trying to reach each
other for a long period of time. Counting phone message slips is
not the same as counting phone conversations.''
   Tenney told The Associated Press he is an ombudsman at the FDIC
but said he could not comment on the memo.
   Simon's rival in the November elections, GOP Rep. Lynn Martin,
said she sent has the Sun-Times story to the Senate Ethics
Committee, which she has asked to investigate the Simon-Ballis
connection.
   ``I can't imagine, with all the problems going on in the savings
and loan industry, that you would find it normal procedure to call
someone you do not know on behalf of a major contributor,'' she
said.
   Another FDIC memo, dated July 31, said Simon's calls ``caused''
thrift officials to meet again with Ballis, even though he ``had
refused the latest workout offer,'' the Sun-Times said.
   First Nationwide has said Simon's intervention didn't affect its
handling of the loan, but a settlement was soon worked out with
Ballis.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says National, Republic Parliaments Have Economic Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday a
plan for converting the Soviet Union to a market economy has been
submitted simultaneously to the national parliament and those of
the 15 republics.
   Gorbachev, saying the entire country should be involved in this
``difficult choice,'' was for the first time seeking nationwide
approval _ via the elected parliaments _ of a policy that
previously was determined by the Communist regime's central
government.
   In an interview with the evening television news program
``Vremya,'' Gorbachev confirmed that the plan he endorsed and
submitted to the national and republic parliaments was based on a
radical proposal by economist Stanislav Shatalin.
   In doing so, Gorbachev has rejected the proposal for a more
moderate reform program put forth by Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, who has indicated he would resign if his plan is defeated
when the national legislature reconvenes next week.
   Reflecting the political uncertainty and public anxiety over the
economy, some Soviet newspapers raised questions about the
stability of society. ``Democracy that doesn't provide food is
doomed,'' said an editorial in Wednesday's Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   A columnist for the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta suggested the
military-industrial complex might well decide ``it's cheaper and
safer to launch a military coup.'' He then suggested such an action
would return the nation to the ``stagnation'' that existed under
former leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   The government newspaper Izvestia ran an interview Tuesday with
Col. Gen. Vladislav Achalov, who sought to calm readers by telling
them the presence of paratroops near Moscow was benign. The troops
are helping with the harvest and drilling for the Nov. 7 Revolution
Day parade, he said, and are not a ``threat to democracy. ... So
please don't suspect them in any actions against the people.''
   ``It's a difficult choice to be made,'' Gorbachev said in the
nationally televised broadcast, speaking about the decision to
launch the overall economic reforms.
   ``This is not the choice of one person or of a group of
people,'' he said. ``It is the country that should make its choice.
And having made the choice, to have it going and moving forward.''
   Shatalin's plan calls for transferring most economic authority
from the national government to the republics, who then could move
to free prices, privatize government industries, legalize private
ownership of land and take other steps toward a market-based system.
   Ryzhkov's plan calls for keeping central control over the
economy and making a much slower transition to a market-based
system. He recommended keeping price controls on most food and
household products, while raising the cost of some major items,
such as televisions, radios and refrigerators.
   The parliament of Russia, the largest of the republics, on
Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a version of the Shatalin plan. The
republic, led by popular reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, has taken the
initiative on pressing for economic change, increasing the pressure
on Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev had asked a group of economic experts, led by Abel
Aganbegyan, to hammer out a program to submit to the national
parliament taking elements from both the Shatalin proposal and the
government plan, which was written by Ryzhkov.
   On Tuesday, he told the parliament of his preference for the
Shatalin proposal, and on Wednesday he said the unified plan
submitted to the parliaments ``is generally based on the concept
suggested by the group headed by academician Shatalin.''
   ``But at the same time, it is a new document,'' Gorbachev told
the ``Vremya'' interviewer. ``It has absorbed lots of ideas and
suggestions of the government's program, and of the program
suggested by many scientists ... and many ideas and suggestions
made by our union republics.''
   Gorbachev also appeared to calm the anxieties of a Soviet
populace that has endured shortages of the most basic goods such as

   ``No matter what program we choose, this transition will be the
most difficult compared with anything we have done so far during
the perestroika years,'' he said, referring to the economic and
social program he has launched since taking power in 1985.

<HEAD>Search Continues Without Success for Jet that Disappeared Tuesday</HEAD>

   Canadian, British and American search
planes and vessels on Wednesday combed a 40,000-square-mile area of
the North Atlantic for a jet carrying 16 people that apparently ran
out of fuel and crashed.
   The Boeing 727 jet disappeared about 3 p.m. Tuesday but
officials were still hopeful because the plane was capable of
floating for hours after ditching and carried at least four
liferafts, said Dick Pepper, a federal department of transport
spokesman.
   The jet, owned by Faucett Airlines of Lima, Peru, was carrying
airline employees and their relatives, all Peruvians, when it
disappeared. Earlier reports said there were 18 people aboard but a
Faucett spokesman said Wednesday two people got off the flight
during a stopover in Iceland.
   The plane was bound for Miami from the Mediterranean island of
Malta. It was headed for a refueling stop in Gander, Newfoundland,
when it veered off course.
   The pilot radioed about 200 miles southeast of Cape Race,
Newfoundland, that he was running out of fuel. There were reports
of strong winds in the area Wednesday.

   The Army will recall several hundred regular
Army and reserve retirees to help support the Persian Gulf buildup,
the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   They are needed to fill critical requirements for doctors,
nurses, linguists, aviators and water purification specialists.
   Army spokeswoman Capt. Barbara Goodno said it is the first time
the service has ever taken such a step.
   The recall is expected to affect fewer than 500 retirees, the
service said. It is expected that the initial recall will be for a
180-day period.
   Of the number recalled, about half will perform medically
related duties and 150 will provide family support services.
   Most will stay in the United States, although a few may be sent
to the Middle East, the Army said.
   The Secretary of the Army has the legal authority to recall
retirees who have completed at least 20 years of active duty and
are receiving retired pay.
   ``There is no age restriction,'' Goodno said.
   She said nearly any retiree could be recalled if he were
specifically needed, but that each must meet the physical criteria
required for all soldiers.

<HEAD>Sawallisch Becomes Music Director of Philadelphia Orchestra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON BEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maestro Wolfgang Sawallisch on Wednesday was
appointed music director of the venerable Philadelphia Orchestra,
the third major U.S. orchestra to pass the baton to a German in the
past two years.
   ``This orchestra stands at the top, and I've known a lot of
orchestras,'' the 67-year-old Sawallisch told reporters.
   ``It is the most important thing I can remember,'' he said of
his appointment.
   Sawallisch becomes the sixth music director since the orchestra
was founded in 1900, the latest in a distinguished line that
included Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy.
   ``These are some pretty big shoes for me to fill,'' Sawallisch
said.
   Sawallisch will succeed Riccardo Muti starting with the 1993-94
season.
   ``I know that I will be leaving the orchestra in the hands of a
colleague for whom I have great respect, admiration and
friendship,'' said Muti, who also is music director at Milan's La
Scala opera house and is conducting in Vienna this week.
   Theodore A. Burtis, president of the Philadelphia Orchestra
Association, said 230 candidates were considered since Muti
announced in the spring that he would not renew his contract, which
expires in August 1992.
   Sawallisch is currently music director and general director of
the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, where he was born in 1923.
Sawallisch will leave that job at the conclusion of the 1992-93
season. He plans to keep his Munich home and spend three to four
months a year in Philadelphia.
   Sawallisch becomes the third German to take over as music
director of a major U.S. orchestra. In April, Kurt Masur was
appointed by the New York Philaharmonic. Christoph Eschenbach took
over in Houston in September 1988.
   John Rockwell, a critic for The New York Times, said the moves
seem to reflect a growing preference for Germanic musical
interpretation _ traditional, structured music, the opposite of
what the flashy, flamboyant Muti is likely to produce.
   Larry Grika, a violinist for Philadelphia and a member of the
search committee, said Sawallisch doesn't necessarily fit the mold.
   ``He shows up in a conservative German business suit and tie,
but he is a romantic when he picks up the baton,'' Grika said.
   Sawallisch began his conducting career with the Opera Theatre of
Augsburg. He was later named music director in Aachen, Wiesbaden
and Cologne. In 1953 he became the youngest conductor ever invited
to lead the Berlin Philharmonic as well as the Bayreuth Festival.
   In the 1960s, he was chief conductor of the Vienna Symphony
Orchestra and music director of the Hamburg Philharmonic. He was
named music director of the Bavarian State Opera in 1971 and chief
conductor and artistic director of the Orchestre de la Suisse
Romande in 1973. He held both jobs until 1980.
   Stokowski, the Philadelphia Orchestra's third music director,
lifted the orchestra to world-class status during his reign from
1912-36. He and the orchestra appeared in the Disney movie
``Fantasia.'' Ormandy replaced Stokowski in 1936 and the big,
booming ``Philadelphia Sound'' further boosted the orchestra's
stature.
   That sound attracted Muti, who replaced Ormandy in 1980.

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Says China Pursuing Torture, Arrests in Tibet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities are arresting and torturing
Tibetans despite the end of martial law in Tibet, the Dalai Lama
said Wednesday.
   The Nobel prize winner and spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists
was in New York to help launch a yearlong campaign to raise public
awareness of Tibetan culture and call attention to China's rule
over his homeland.
   In March 1989, civil strife rocked Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,
and martial law was imposed for a year. The Public Security Bureau
in Tibet later said 387 Lhasa citizens died in the anti-Chinese
riots. Most of them were Tibetans but some security forces also
were killed, the bureau said.
   Tibetans claim more than 450 of their people were killed.
   Martial law was lifted in March, but the Dalai Lama told
reporters ``the actual situation has not at all improved.''
   ``The military uniformed personnel changed their clothes to
police uniforms and plainclothes. ... Incidents of arrest and
torture, these also continue,'' said the Dalai Lama, who won the
1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership of his people.
   He said he feared that ``in 15 years, if present conditions
don't change, the Tibetan community will become insignificant in
its own land,'' now a province of China.
   About 6 million Tibetans still live in their homeland, but they
are outnumbered by Chinese even in Tibet.
   ``After 40 years of Chinese occupation, much of Tibet's
civilization has been destroyed,'' the Dalai Lama said.
   Actor Richard Gere, who is the president of Tibet House in New
York, introduced the Dalai Lama at a news conference to begin the
Year of Tibet, a series of art exhibits and cultural events to
promote public awareness of Tibetan culture.
   ``Many of my friends find Tibetan culture quite healthy, quite
useful,'' said the Dalai Lama, who then chuckled and added, ``But I
don't know.''
   Many of his remarks were sprinkled with self-deprecating humor.
   The Year of Tibet opens with a show of more than 150 works of
Tibetan art, including 31 from the Hermitage collection in
Leningrad, in April 1991 at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco.
It moves to New York in October 1991.

   Troops engaged in Operation Desert Shield can
send letters home for free, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank
announced Wednesday.
   Frank told postal workers to immediately begin accepting mail,
without postage, from troops engaged in the buildup in the Persian
Gulf region.
   ``Now our military personnel can send messages to friends and
loved ones back home without postage,'' said Frank. ``We'll take
all the letters they give us.''
   The free mail applies to letters and audio cassettes sent to the
United States, but not to other parcels, Frank said. Mail sent to
personnel in the Middle East must still carry postage.
   Frank said he acted in response to bills in Congress designed to
give the free-mail privilege to Desert Shield personnel. By taking
immediate action, Frank said, he avoided the delay of having the
bills pass both houses and go to the president.
   Service personnel can obtain the free postage by writing
``Free'' on the upper right hand corner of envelopes and placing
their name, military grade and military address on the upper left
hand corner, postal officials said.

<HEAD>Israeli Security Forces Disrupt Palestinian Peacemaking Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's security forces disrupted a
peacemaking meeting of rival Palestinian groups Wednesday in an
occupied West Bank town and arrested some of the participants,
according to news reports.
   Israel radio and the national Itim news agency said the
gathering in Tulkarem was held to work out a truce between the
fundamentalist Moslem Hamas movement and factions of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   At least 20 Arabs were injured this week in warfare in and
around Tulkarem, where the rival movements also have traded angry
underground leaflets. Some incidents of Hamas-PLO fighting also
were reported in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Hamas and the PLO have been allied in the 34-month-old uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied lands, but they also have had
disputes over tactics and control. The latest outbreak of street
battles and knifings was among the most violent, Arab reports say.
   Participants in the Tulkarem meeting, held at the municipal
building, included representatives of Hamas and Fatah, the PLO's
largest faction. Such figures as Faisal Husseini, a leading pro-PLO
activist from east Jerusalem, and sheik Subhi Al Bitawi, a regional
Hamas leader, also were invited, Itim said.
   Itim and Israel radio said agents of Israel's Shin Bet security
service and paramilitary border police surrounded the building and
prevented Husseini from entering. Security forces then went in and
detained participants.
   Leading ``Palestinian personalities'' were later released but 20
Hamas and Fatah activists, among them some wanted by Israeli
authorities, were arrested, Itim said.
   An army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
keeping with military rules, confirmed there were ``arrests in
Tulkarem in the framework of routine activities of the security
forces'' but said he had no further details.
   Some Palestinian observers expressed suspicions that the action
was aimed at prolonging the warfare between the rival Arab factions.
   In 1989, there were fistfights and knifings in the West Bank
between Hamas activists, who advocate an Islamic state, and pro-PLO
factions, who traditionally have been secular in their approach.
   Hamas, one of the groups that started the uprising, has argued
for the overthrow of Israel, while the PLO factions have backed PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat's call for negotiations.
   In July, three Palestinians from the West Bank village of Idna
were killed in a clash that pitted Fatah supporters against members
of other PLO factions. Family rivalries also were blamed.
   At least 258 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs in
the uprising, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Some
729 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians
in the revolt; 47 Israelis also have been killed.

<HEAD>Report Typifies Lack of Rural Health Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half a million Americans live in counties with
no obstetrician and more than 300,000 live in counties that have no
physicians at all, said a congressional report issued Wednesday.
   These figures typify the health care problems facing people who
live in sparsely populated areas, where hospitals are losing money,
one in six families lives in poverty and 18 percent are uninsured,
the report said.
   Nearly 57 million people _ about 23 percent of the U.S.
population _ live in what are considered rural areas, said the
report by the Office of Technology Assessment.
   ``The future prospect for rural health care in the absence of
intervention (by the federal or state governments) is grim,'' the
report said. ``Rural America cannot support its present complement
of hospitals and the hospitals are going broke.''
   Rural hospitals tend to have low occupancy rates because they
are losing patients and ``many small community facilities will
continue to lose wealthier patients to more distant urban hospitals
and clinics,'' the report said.
   Rural hospitals are also losing money because they have a high
rate of patients who cannot pay the full costs for their care.
   Rural areas also have a difficult time recruiting and retaining
doctors, nurses and other health care professionals, and in some
areas ``an absolute lack of providers may become a crisis
situation,'' the report said.
   In 1988, 111 counties with a total of 325,100 residents had no
physicians, the report said.

   The plan requires passage of a law by Congress and the signature

   The idea was prompted by attacks in recent years on some federal

<HEAD>Poindexter Appeal Assigned to Judges Uninvolved in North Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has refused to assign
John M. Poindexter's appeal of Iran-Contra convictions to the same
panel that set aside guilty verdicts against Oliver L. North.
   The three judges of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia that set aside North's Iran-Contra convictions
July 20, this week issued an order assigning Poindexter's case to a
different panel.
   Poindexter had argued in a motion filed Aug. 1 that the same
panel should consider his appeal of a six-month sentence for five
counts of lying about the Iran-Contra affair because the case
presented the same issues that were confronted in North's case.
   The panel voted 2-1 to set aside North's convictions, ruling
that references to the immunized testimony he gave Congress may
have seeped into the trial. Both North and Poindexter gave
testimony to the congressional panels that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair under limited grants of immunity from
prosecution.
   Those grants meant that their testimony could not be used
against them in criminal trials.
   The appellate panel, over the vigorous defense of Chief Judge
Patricia Wald, ruled that the judge in North's case should hold a
``witness by witness'' hearing to determine if any testimony was
influenced by what North told Congress during highly publicized
hearings.
   In his petition to assign his case to the same panel, Poindexter
said his appeal ``raises the identical issues based upon identical
facts and the identical ruling by the same trial court.''
   But independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh opposed what he called
Poindexter's ``undisguised attempt to select the judges who decided
adversely to the government in U.S. v. North.''
   The panel, which also included circuit judges Laurence Silberman
and David Sentelle, denied Poindexter's request because it was not
filed before the July 23 deadline for procedural motions.
   Poindexter was convicted April 7 of lying to Congress about the
covert military assistance to Nicaraguan rebels and the sale of
U.S. arms to Iran. Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who was
once then-President Reagan's national security adviser, was given a
six month prison sentence June 11 by U.S. District Judge Harold H.
Greene.
   Poindexter remains free pending the appeal, which will be
assigned to another three judge panel of the court.

<HEAD>EC, Syria Move Toward Normalization of Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy will propose that the European Community
normalize relations with Syria, Italy's foreign minister said
Wednesday.
   Economic ties have been frozen since 1986, when the 12-nation EC
accused Syria of involvement in international terrorism.
   However, Syria has been among the Arab nations that have worked
closely with Western nations since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2
and set off the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``It is time for a full restoration of relations between the EC
and Syria,'' Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis told reporters
after talks in Rome with his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Sharaa.
   A five-year EC economic aid package for Syria of $191 million
was suspended in 1986. De Michelis said he will propose Monday at
the EC's headquarters in Brussels that those funds be released
immediately and that negotiations begin on a new five-year accord.
   Italy holds the rotating presidency of the community.
   ``This is the first important step for complete normalization of
relations,'' De Michelis said.
   Al-Sharra said, ``We are looking forward to much better
relations between Syria and the European Community. Our cooperation
is very important for stability and security in the Middle East,
and the gulf as well.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was to travel to Damascus,
Syria, on Thursday, and al-Sharaa said the visit ``will certainly
normalize and improve very much'' the relations between Syria and
the United States.
   ``We have been pursuing dialogue for a couple of years,'' he
said. ``This visit will prove that this dialogue has yielded
results.''
   The two countries have been at odds in the past over Middle East
issues and U.S. allegations of Syrian involvement in terrorism.
   Italy and Syria will reopen talks in Damascus this fall on
commercial, technical and scientific relations, he said. It will be
the first such meeting in three years.
   De Michelis said Wednesday's talks produced a ``complete
identity of views between the EC and Syria'' on the gulf crisis.
   Both agree on the need for strict implementation of the U.N.
resolutions calling for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, as well as
compliance with the economic embargo against Iraq. Syria and the EC
also believe a military solution must be avoided, De Michelis said.
   De Michelis reacted coolly to the release of 10 Italian male
hostages by Iraq. The 10, including seven who were ill, flew
Wednesday to Jordan from Baghdad and were scheduled to return to
Italy on Thursday.
   It is believed to be the first time Iraq has allowed a group of
Western male hostages to leave since the Rev. Jesse Jackson
arranged for the departure of four American men on Sept. 1.

   About 2,700 textile workers from mills up and
down the East Coast marched Wednesday outside the White House,
asking Congress to back a bill restricting the growth of U.S.
imports despite President Bush's veto threats.
   Waving signs that read ``Save Our Jobs: Limit Imports,'' workers
from shoe and clothing factories in New York, Pennsylvania, North
Carolina and other states marched from the Capitol down
Pennsylvania Avenue to Lafayette Park, just across the street from
the White House.
   They urged support for a Senate-passed measure to restrict the
growth of U.S. imports of textiles and apparel to 1 percent a year
and freeze imports of shoes at 1989 levels.
   The House could vote on a similar plan Tuesday, supporters said.
   The Senate bill is nearly identical to measures passed by
Congress in 1985 and 1988 but vetoed by President Reagan.
   Bush's senior advisers have recommended a veto as well.
   Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III wrote House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley to say the textile bill would hurt U.S.
efforts in the Persian Gulf.
   Baker said the textile bill would violate existing trade
agreements with Turkey and Egypt, ``countries that are
indispensable to our efforts to solidify crucial international
collaboration.''
   In addition, Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser, said
the legislation would hurt American consumers by driving up prices,
threaten progress in ongoing trade talks and reduce U.S.
international competitiveness.
   Supporters of the measure contend the domestic textile industry
and its workers are being used as a ``sacrificial lamb'' in the
administration's jockeying to reduce foreign trade barriers to U.S.
exports.
   At the rally, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said U.S. textile
workers' jobs should not be ``sacrificed on the altar of the State
Department's foreign policy notions.''
   Since 1980, the U.S. trade deficit on textiles and apparel has
jumped from $4.7 billion to $26.5 billion, making it the second
largest component of the nation's trade deficit behind oil.
   Over the same time, more than 1,800 textile and apparel plants
have closed and employment has dropped by 400,000, to just over 1.9
million jobs, despite an $18 billion modernization effort.
   But critics contend the bill would cost consumers $25 billion to
$27 billion a year in higher prices.
   Jack Sheinkman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Unions, said the workers who traveled to Washington
were trying to drum up enough support so the bill could pass the
House with enough votes to override a veto, or more than two-thirds.
   The Senate passed the measure by a potentially veto-overriding
68-32.
   ``These people are fighting for a job _ not a handout,''
Sheinkman said.
   Loretha Miller, a 36-year-old mother of three from Andrews,
S.C., said the textile mill where she used to work let her go three
weeks ago.
   ``I'm laid off right now because of the imports,'' she said.
   When the Senate passed the bill, Bush rejected a request from
lawmakers from textile-producing states to back away from his
threatened veto.
   ``I can't say I think the answer to the problem of textiles is
further protection,'' Bush said at the time.
   The Senate measure would establish nation-by-nation quotas on
U.S. imports of textiles, apparel and non-rubber footwear beginning
this year, except for certain products from Canada and Israel,
which have free-trade agreements with the United States.
   Textile and apparel imports, which have tripled in the last
decade, would be allowed to grow only 1 percent a year while shoe
imports would be frozen at their 1989 level.
   However, to reduce opposition from farm interests who fear
retaliation, the bill would provide increases in quotas to
countries that increase their purchases of U.S. agricultural
products.

   The Congressional Budget Office predicted
Wednesday that even without a recession, 600 to 700 commercial
banks will fail over the next 3{ years and drain the government's
deposit insurance funds by more than $20 billion.
   The projection came just one day after a report that the
government already is only the hook for at least $8 billion in as
yet unreported losses from the collapse of Texas banks in the 1980s.
   The budget office assessment added to fears that banks, just
like S&amp;Ls, will require a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout.
   Robert Reischauer, director of the budget office, agreed with an
assessment Tuesday by the General Accounting Office that a
recession or the failure of a single major commercial bank could
force the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s $13.2 billion bank
insurance fund into insolvency.
   ``There is a possibility there, yes,'' Reischauer told the
Senate Banking Committee. ``We're on thin ice, but the pants are
still dry.''
   If the declining real estate values now plaguing the Northeast
spread nationwide and fall as far as they did in the Southwest, the
FDIC could experience up to $40 billion in net losses by the end of
1993.
   Lawmakers, reeling from the political fallout of the savings and
loan debacle that has forced President Bush to renege on his ``no
new taxes'' pledge, introduced bills in both the House and Senate
to bolster the FDIC's funds. The bills would permit higher
insurance premiums assessed against banks.
   The FDIC now charges banks 12 cents a year for every $100 in
insured deposits. Under the S&amp;L bailout law passed last year the
premium will automatically rise next January to 15 cents, but the
agency has proposed raising it to 19.5 cents.
   Even with the larger increase, the General Accounting Office
said insurance funds would still not have enough money, without a
taxpayer rescue, to cover possible losses to bank depositors during
a recession.
   ``It would be a mistake for Congress to adjourn this fall
without ensuring that the FDIC has whatever authority it needs to
raise assessment premiums,'' said Senate Banking Committee Chairman
Donald Riegle, D-Mich.
   Riegle introduced a bill to allow the FDIC to raise the premiums
by however much is necessary to increase reserves by $25 billion to
$35 billion.
   ``I hope such increases will not be needed, but Congress' first
priority must be to protect the bank insurance fund and the
taxpayers that stand behind it,'' he said.
   A similar bill introduced in the House Wednesday by Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., the chairman of the Banking Committee's financial
institutions subcommittee, would require the FDIC to raise its
annual premiums to $1 for every $100 of deposit coverage.
   ``The taxpayer should not be saddled with another bill for
financial institution failure,'' said Annunzio, who scheduled a
subcommittee vote on his proposal for Sept. 27. ``We must act to
prevent this catastrophe.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Wednesday that the
Bush administration also will send a bill to Congress ``in the next
several days'' to raise deposit insurance premiums.
   ``We believe the FDIC should have all the tools it needs to act
responsibly,'' Brady said.
   Two other House Banking Committee members _ Reps. Richard
Lehman, D-Calif., and Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis., introduced a bill
Wednesday that would limit deposit insurance to $100,000 per
individual depositor.
   The FDIC now insures each account up to $100,000 with no limit
on how many insured accounts a single depositor can have.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, has
endorsed the idea of limiting the number of insured accounts and
reducing the insurance limit.
   The Bush administration had previously asked Congress to wait
until it completes a study early next year on the entire issue of
deposit insurance before making any changes in the law.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan, who once used the
Berlin Wall to give the East bloc a rhetorical bashing, grabbed a
hammer and chisel Wednesday to take a few real whacks at the
remnants of the Cold War barrier.
   Onlookers applauded and shouted, ``We love you Ronnie!'' and,
``Bravo, Ronnie!'' as the 79-year-old Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
walked through the landmark Brandenburg Gate between East and West
Berlin.
   A hundred yards further, the Reagans came to one of the few
remaining sections of the concrete wall in central Berlin. The
ex-president, his tongue sticking through his teeth in
determination, gave it a few smacks.
   In a speech three years ago in West Berlin, Reagan challenged
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''
   Reagan's presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif., has a
three-ton section of the wall, which was opened in November
following an autumn of pro-democracy demonstrations. The two
Germanys are scheduled for reunification Oct. 3.
   ``Looking back one year, who would have believed that today you
would be in the final stages of uniting your country?'' Reagan said
in a speech later to a forum on Germany's future.
   ``Today, that symbol of separation, the Berlin Wall, is a fading
memory. Yet, for nearly three decades it had separated the German
people and it symbolized the lack of freedom for those in East
Germany to travel, to speak out, to live and to work where they
chose.''
   He predicted the united Germany would be a partner in Western
security and economic growth and join international peacekeeping
forces.
   ``It will also serve as a symbol of the unquenchable human
spirit, a spirit embodied in the terms `freiheit' _ freedom _ and
`einigkeit' _ unity.''
   After visiting the wall, Reagan visited East German Parliament
President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl. She said she hoped Reagan would
return to visit the country after unification.
   Berlin was Reagan's first stop on a 10-day European trip that
also includes scheduled stops in Poland, the Soviet Union and
Italy. On Thursday, he is expected to travel to Bonn, the West
German capital, to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Reagan said he believes the course for reforms in Eastern Europe
began in the early 1980s when West Germany agreed to accept bases
for cruise missiles with nuclear warheads and the U.S. began its
``Star Wars'' Strategic Defense Initiative, conceived as a shield
against nuclear strikes.
   Both decisions forced the Soviets to accept a treaty on
intermediate-range nuclear forces and focus more on internal
economic problems, he said.
   ``Inevitably, they loosened their grip on the states of central
and Eastern Europe,'' Reagan said.

<HEAD>Ex-Czech General Says Warsaw Pact Planned to Invade Poland in 1980</HEAD>

   A retired Czechoslovak general said Warsaw
Pact troops were prepared to invade Poland in 1980 to crush the
Solidarity labor movement, according to an interview published
Wednesday.
   But the former Czechoslovak officer, Gen. Stanislav Prochazka,
said the invasion plans were abruptly scrubbed after former Polish
Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski told Pact leaders some
Polish army units would probably fight back.
   Prochazka made his remarks in an interview headlined, ``We Were
Already in the Tanks,'' published in the current issue of the
Polish weekly Polityka.
   Prochazka was the commander of the western region of the
Czechoslovak army, but retired after he opposed the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that suppressed the Prague Spring
reform movement.
   He is now a military adviser to Czechoslovakia's new
non-Communist government involved in efforts to democratize the
army. Although he did not participate in the 1980 preparations,
Prochazka said he obtained his information from reports now
accessible to him.
   In August 1980, a nationwide strike wave forced Poland's
Communist authorities to allow workers the right to form
Solidarity, the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc.
   The strikes toppled then-Communist leader Edward Gierek, and
aroused fears among the conservative Kremlin leadership headed by
Leonid Brezhnev.
   Prochazka said the Soviet-led military alliance prepared its
invasion plans in earnest in November 1980.
   ``Soldiers were told that Poland needs international help,
because Solidarity seriously threatens socialism,'' Prochazka
recalled.
   ``The soldiers were prepared mentally and physically for
possible fighting. They were told that they could expect military
resistance from the Polish army.''
   Troops were moved into attack positions in early December, but
the invasion plans were suddenly called off on Dec. 5 after a
meeting of Warsaw Pact leaders in Moscow, he told Polityka.
   Prochazka credited Jaruzelski, then Poland's defense minister,
with averting a ``tragic battle'' by convincing other Pact leaders
that an invasion would mean a high price in bloodshed because at
least part of the army would likely resist.
   ``I think that Jaruzelski successfully explained at the Kremlin
what was obvious to everyone: that intervention in Poland would not
be another Czechoslovak August 1968.''
   There was no organized resistance from the Czechoslovak army
when troops from the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations,
including Poland, invaded.
   ``I know how Gen. Jaruzelski is criticized in Poland for
implementing martial law (in December 1981). But it is a fact that
then, in 1980, he prevented a massacre,'' Prochazka said.
   According to Prochazka, the invasion plans called for 45,000
Czechoslovakian troops and a tank divison to cross the border in
two columns directed toward the southwestern Polish cities of
Wroclaw and Opole.
   Soviet troops were to invade from the east, and a ``symbolic''
contingent of East German troops was to come in from the west, he
said.
   ``The date of full military readiness was set for Dec. 6,'' he
said.
   Troops were issued live ammunition and officers received maps
with their objectives, he said.
   ``We were supposed to surround Polish military units in their
barracks, completely disabling them from doing anything and
allowing Polish authorities to intern Solidarity activists,'' he
said.
   Prochazka said ``everyone was convinced that the intervention
was inevitable,'' but on Dec. 5 at 8 p.m. the troops were ordered
to lower readiness.
   On Dec. 6, the troops began to withdraw from the border, and by
Dec. 10 they were back in their barracks, he said.
   The power struggle between Poland's Communist authorities and
Solidarity continued through 1981, amid recurring Soviet threats.
   On Dec. 13, 1981, Jaruzelski, who had been named prime minister
and Communist Party leader, led the military crackdown that
suppressed Solidarity.
   Jaruzelski defended his action as a ``lesser evil,'' implying
that if the Polish army had not acted decisively the result would
have been a Soviet-led invasion with much bloodshed.
   Although banned, Solidarity survived underground throughout the
1980s and regained its legal status in April 1989 under a
power-sharing agreement with Communist authorities.
   Solidarity won an overwhelming victory in partially free
elections in June 1989 and went on to establish the East bloc's
first non-Communist government.
   Jaruzelski was elected president by Parliament in July 1989, but
has been under pressure to resign.

   Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Silber was
shouted out of a neighborhood Wednesday as he tried to explain why
he called its residents ``a group of drug addicts.'' He did not
apologize for the remark.
   ``I'm not a drug addict,'' Priscilla Flint Russell told Silber.
``Hey man, get the hell out of here.''
   Russell repeatedly asked Silber where he thought the drugs came
from and peppered him with unrelated questions about Boston
University. He is on leave as the college's president. After
several minutes, Silber said: `I have no time for that
fanaticism,'' and ended the press conference.
   Silber called the session in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury
to explain a comment he made during a debate Tuesday with candidate
Francis X. Bellotti, a former attorney general. The Democratic
primary is next Tuesday.
   Silber, asked how often he campaigned in the high-crime police
district including Roxbury, Mattapan and parts of Dorchester, said:
``I will tell you something about that area. There is no point in
my making a speech on crime control to a group of drug addicts.''
   Black community leaders were outraged, but Silber did not
apologize Wednesday, insisting that that his words were
misinterpreted by opponents who paint him as racist. The
neighborhoods are mostly black.
   ``I am sorry that you've been misled,'' he said to the crowd of
mostly journalists. Neighborhood residents milled around and
watched from front steps and balconies.
   ``And if your feelings have been hurt, I certainly regret
that,'' he said. ``But my intentions were quite clear. My
intentions were to point to crime in this area and to the fact that
it's long overdue that we clean this area up.''
   Russell interrupted Silber, saying that two of her sons had
died, but neither from drug abuse. One died in a fire and another
in a car accident, said Russell, who said she once worked for the
Boston University school of nursing, which closed in 1987.
   Shortly before Silber arrived in Roxbury on Wednesday, black
leaders held a press conference nearby at a neighborhood park.
   ``No wicked, racist individual who deserves no name _ a wicked
individual _ should slander our community by calling us drug
addicts or mad dog killers to perpetuate the kind of racist
attitudes and the kind of racist atmosphere that was created around
the Charles Stuart murder case,'' said Rep. Gloria Fox, D-Boston.
   Racial tensions were heightened last October, after Carol Stuart
was shot and killed in the Mission Hill section of Boston. Her
husband, Charles, blamed a black attacker and police scoured black
neighborhoods. A black man was arrested on unrelated charges and
identified as a suspect in the murder.
   Later, Charles Stuart apparently killed himself after learning
his brother had implicated him in the killing.
   Vernice Gabriel, 76, who has lived in the neighborhood for
almost 40 years, said Silber made a mistake, but acknowledged the
area had problems.
   ``It's true we can't come out in the street,'' Gabriel said. ``I
know I'm a prisoner in my house. I can't even sit on my steps.''

   Frustrated by the slow response of allies to
the campaign against Iraq, the House adopted legislation Wednesday
to force America's friends to pay a greater portion of the overall
defense burden.
   By a vote of 370-53, the House approved an amendment to the $283
billion defense bill to require Japan to pay all the costs of
stationing U.S. forces in the Asian nation, or begin losing the
troops.
   ``Collective security means collective responsibility,'' Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the Democratic leadership, said
before the vote that lawmakers believed would send a clear message
to Japan.
   Legislators spent the first full day of debate on the defense
budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, lashing out at Japan
and other allies that have limited their contributions to the U.S.
effort to stop Iraqi aggression.
   Although the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., didn't vote for the measure, he
acknowledged the motivations of his colleagues.
   ``It is not the right thing to do substantively but it's
irresistible politically,'' Aspin said.
   The House also agreed to require the Defense Department to come
up with a plan by 1994 to ``dual base'' all military units _
permanently stationing all American troops in the United States and
ordering short-term rotation overseas.
   It agreed to prohibit using any Defense Department money for
building a new air base at Crotone, Italy, for the 401st Tactical
Air Wing of F-16 jet fighters.
   An amendment by Rep. David Martin, R-N.Y., to eliminate the
``dual base'' provision as well as the language on the facility at
Crotone failed by a vote of 249-174.
   The measures are not included in the version of the defense bill
approved by the Senate and will have to be worked out in conference
between the two chambers.
   Under the amendment on Japan, the Asian nation would be required
to pay all the costs associated with the 50,000 U.S. troops
deployed to the Asian nation. For each year Japan does not cover
the costs, 5,000 troops would be taken out of the country.
   The United States spends $4.5 billion annually for U.S. forces
in Japan; Japan contributes $2.9 billion.
   ``This is a wake-up call. This is a real wake-up call for the
new world order,'' said Bonior, sponsor of the legislation.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., said the allies ``will allow us to
pay the expense of their defense as long as Uncle Sugar will do
it.''
   The House, however, rejected an amendment that would impose a
permanent ceiling of 30,000 on the number of U.S. troops in South
Korea with that goal to be achieved by 1993. The vote was 265-157
against.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has called for reducing the
current number of 43,000 troops by 7,000 over the next three fiscal
years.
   In other action, the House approved, 287-134, a measure calling
for establishment of a new base closure process similar to the
independent commission that selected 86 installations for closing
or new missions two years ago.
   The amendment prohibits Cheney from closing any domestic base
until Congress has approved a new system, or until Jan. 1, 1992,
whichever comes first.
   This past January, the secretary recommended closing or changing
more than 50 bases worldwide, a move than led to charges of
partisanship from Democrats on Capitol Hill who contended the list
targeted bases in their districts.
   Legislators also clashed over amendments to increase or decrease
the 1991 budget for the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as Star Wars. A vote on the SDI amendments was delayed until
Thursday as the House sought to wrap up Wednesday's action on the
bill by early evening.
   President Bush proposed spending $4.7 billion on the
anti-missile shield in his January budget request. The Senate cut
about $1 billion from the proposal and the House Armed Services
Committee slashed nearly $2 billion.
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed Services panel, Rep.
Bill Dickinson of Alabama, said he received a letter from Bush
stressing that Star Wars ``has made tremendous progress to
strengthen deterrence.''
   ``If we continue to decimate the program,'' Dickinson told his
colleagues, ``the final product will look something like a lace
doily and it will not be signed by the president.''
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sponsor of an amendment to end
Star Wars, said it was time to stop paying ``billions of dollars on
a fairy tale.''

   Eight environmental pioneers were named
Wednesday to spend two years with just each other _ and 3,800
varieties of plants and animals _ inside a glass-and-steel dome
trying to duplicate Earth's ecosystem.
   Among the crew are a 66-year-old gerontologist, an electrical
engineer, a marine biologist and a botanist. They are two Britons,
a Belgian, a German and four Americans.
   All the ``biospherians'' have worked together for at least three
years on the Biosphere II project, an attempt to copy the planet's
natural environment inside a 2\-acre closed, self-sustaining
system. The planet's natural environment is designated Biosphere I.
   ``I'm working five years toward this aim of a two-year closure,
and the closer the day comes, the more excited I get,'' said crew
leader Bernd Zabel, a 41-year-old German.
   As a laboratory for showing ways to solve environmental problems
such as pollution, the privately funded Biosphere could become a
moneymaking venture, scientists have said. It also is a prototype
for sustaining life in space.
   Inside the sealed geodesic frame, all air, water, food and
wastes will be regenerated and recycled.
   Only electricity will link its ecological system with the
outside. Computers and telephones will provide communications with
mission control and the rest of the world.
   Crew members will be able to leave via airlocks in event of
emergency.
   Plans call for the venture to begin Dec. 5.
   The other crew members, all single, are Abigail K. Alling, 31, a
marine biologist and co-captain; Dr. Roy Walford, a nationally
noted gerontologist and nutritionist and professor of pathology at
the UCLA School of Medicine who will be medical officer; Linda
Leigh, 38, scientific director; Sally Silverstone, 35; Taber K.
MacCallum, 26; Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, and Mark Van Thillo, 29.
   The $30 million world-within-the-world will be like a space
colony tethered to Earth. It consists of distinct ecological areas,
or biomes: desert, ocean, savannah, fresh and saltwater marshes,
agriculture and human habitat.
   ``I'm sure there'll be many emergencies that arise during that
two-year period, but I think also that it ought to be an extremely
stimulating and mind-expanding experience,'' said Margret
Augustine, chief executive officer of Space Biospheres Ventures.
   She said all the crew members are highly qualified, talented,
dedicated, enthusiastic and ``extremely special people.'' By facing
difficult and dangerous situations in other ventures, she said,
they have shown themselves capable of ``coming up with the needed
decisions and actions at the appropriate time.''
   Augustine said six other people who were candidates for the crew
also hold key management positions with the project and will be
involved in the experiment.
   Asked about possible relationships developing among the people
sealed inside the Biosphere, Leigh said that would be a personal
matter as long as it doesn't interfere with their work.
   ``I anticipate there will be relationships developing as there
are in Biosphere I. I don't really see that will change,'' she said.
   The wildlife areas interconnect, with only the agriculture and
human habitat areas partitioned. The latter includes apartments,
offices, labs and recreational space.
   Plants will dispose of the humans' and animal's carbon dioxide,
breaking it down into oxygen and carbon, and will provide food.
Microbes will break down wastes; filters will purify air and water.
   Moisture in the fairly humid confines will condense on
refrigerated coils over the tropical rain forest.
   The biospherians will monitor and take advantage of the
ecological mix, which will range from rice to papayas, sorghum to
sweet potatoes, plus wild plants, rotating from among 150 crops
seasonally.

<HEAD>Indians Climb Andes to Demand Return of Ancestral Lands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 800 Indians are marching 470 miles
from the jungle lowlands to the thin air of this capital to
dramatize their anguish over the deforestation of the rainforest
where they live.
   As the marchers entered the highlands in the third week of a
trek that has gained widespread attention here, Bolivian President
Jaime Paz Zamora flew Wednesday with members of his Cabinet to meet
with them along a dirt highway.
   ``The march is not against anybody but a call for Bolivians to
pay attention to their plight,'' Paz Zamora said in a radio
interview after the meeting near Yolosa, 90 miles east of La Paz.
   Fernando Cajias, governor of the La Paz province, said ``initial
agreements regarding the need to prevent the exploitation of
forests from affecting the survival of indian groups have been
reached.''
   The marchers, pressing for the return of 750,000 acres of land
deeded to lumber companies, left their jungle villages and began
the march last month from Trinidad.
   This week the march route left the tropical lowlands and began
its climb into the Andes. The marchers are expected in La Paz,
which is 13,000 feet above sea level, this weekend.
   The march, which involves various small Indian tribes, has
captivated the attention of Bolivians by exposing the misery of the
oft-neglected tribes from the isolated lowlands of interior Bolivia.
   Residents along the way have provided marchers with food and
lodging. Support groups from La Paz assisted with emergency medical
care. Doctors said at least 100 of the Indians were suffering from
high-altitude sickness.
   Indian leaders say the march is ``for the dignity and defense of
native territories.'' The Indian groups are asking the government
to overturn contracts that granted the huge tracts of tropical
rainforest in the Amazon and La Plata river basins to four lumber
companies.
   The contracts were signed under the administration of Victor Paz
Estenssoro, who turned over the presidency to Paz Zamora, his
nephew, after elections in May 1989.
   A coalition of Indian groups say the logging companies are not
replanting the mahoganies and other fine woods they cut and are
destroying the delicate ecological balance of the area.
   The government's forestry board, which advocates the interests
of logging companies, took out adds in local papers Wednesday
saying loggers were not damaging the environment.
   Several hundred thousand Indians live in isolated communities,
or as nomadic fishermen and hunters, in the vast tropical lowlands
of eastern Bolivia.
   Bolivia, a poor landlocked country in South America's
midsection, has about 7 million residents.

   A British military helicopter
returning to a Canadian base from a training exercise crashed
Wednesday, killing one of three people on board, officials said.
   Capt. Viv Thatcher, spokesman for Canadian Forces Base Suffield
in southern Alberta, said the survivors managed to escape after the
crash, but the third crew member was killed when the helicopter
caught fire.
   None of the crew members were identified. Thatcher said the
cause was unknown and the crash was under investigation.
   The Gazelle helicopter was returning from exercises when it went
down about nine miles northeast of the base. British armed forces
use the Suffield base, about 125 mile southeast of Calgary, as a
training center.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighters loyal to rebel leader Charles
Taylor advanced to within firing distance of the presidential
mansion Wednesday, filling a vacuum left by a rival group's
execution of President Samuel Doe.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., quoting exiled Liberians in the
United States, said Taylor had executed some opponents, among them
prominent politician Jackson Doe.
   Doe, no relation to the late president, was the 1985
presidential candidate of the Liberian Action Party. Many observers
said he was robbed of victory by election officials appointed by
Samuel Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup.
   Taylor's force, mainly untrained youths, had been bogged down by
Samuel Doe's men for nearly three months on Monrovia's eastern
outskirts.
   But Doe died Monday after being captured by rebels under Prince
Yealu Johnson, and his loyalists fled in disarray, offering an
opening for Taylor. Columns of smoke rose as Taylor's rebels
advanced through eastern suburbs behind a barrage of shell, rocket
and gunfire. They moved past the Spriggs Payne Airfield and John F.
Kennedy Hospital to City Hall, a few hundred yards from the
executive mansion.
   About 230 relatives and remnants of Samuel Doe's army were
trapped inside the hilltop, seven-story mansion.
   Prince Johnson _ who earlier in the week had been hunting down
Doe loyalists around the city _ agreed Wednesday to allow the late
president's followers to leave Monrovia if they surrender their
arms.
   Johnson made the offer in response to a request by the chairman
of the Economic Community of West African States, Gambian President
Sir Dawda Jawara, who ordered a West African task force to save
Doe's supporters.
   A long convoy of vehicles from the 3,000-strong West African
peacekeeping force in Monrovia was approaching the mansion late
Wednesday to offer safe conduct in a convoy escorted by two tanks
and a small group of Johnson's men.
   A spokesman for the West Africans said no decision has been
reached about where the Doe supporters would go.
   Taylor started the war when he invaded Liberia from Ivory Coast
on Dec. 24. Johnson was one of Taylor's commanders, but quarreled
with him in March and formed a splinter group.
   The three warring factions have slaughtered more than 5,000 of
Liberia's 2.3 million people, often because of their tribal
affiliations. About 500,000 people have fled their homes.
   Doe was a Krahn, one of 14 small tribes in Liberia. Johnson is
the son of a Gio, and Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian and
native ancestry.

   NASA restored high-speed communications
with Magellan for the first time in four weeks Wednesday, then
released more of the spacecraft's pictures of jagged lava flows and
giant craters on Venus.
   The irregularly shaped craters _ one measuring 5 miles wide _
are called calderas. Each one probably formed when lava flowed out
from underneath the planet's volcanoes, causing the entire top of a
volcano to collapse, said Steve Saunders, Magellan project
scientist.
   A lava flow shown in another picture is ``much like flows on
Earth that are called by geologists `aa' (ah-ah), a Hawaiian word
that probably mimics the sound the ancients uttered while running
barefoot over the rough, jagged surface,'' Saunders said in a news
release.
   The images were made during an Aug. 16 test of Magellan's
picture-making radar, just before the spaceship temporarily lost
contact with Earth for the first time. Engineers at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spent Wednesday preparing Magellan so that it can attempt to make
more pictures during a crucial test on Saturday.
   They turned the spacecraft so its main antenna pointed toward
Earth, experiment representative Steve Wall said. That allowed
Magellan to send back information at up to 268,800 ``bits'' per
second, 6,720 times faster than was possible through its secondary
antenna, which has been used since the communications problems
developed.
   The secondary antenna has a broader radio beam, allowing it to
maintain contact with Earth more easily than the main antenna.
   Restoring the high-speed link was necessary so engineers could
play back the contents of an onboard tape recorder. The recorder
contains more of the radar picture data collected Aug. 16 and
engineering information that may provide clues about Magellan's
troubles.
   The engineers still haven't identified the problem that made
Magellan lose radio contact with Earth for 14 hours starting Aug.
16 and for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21, Wall said.
   Magellan's computers rejected a command Wednesday to turn off a
faulty gyroscope that developed problems when the spacecraft
started orbiting Venus Aug. 10. The device is no longer needed to
help point Magellan, and engineers said it won't harm the mission.
   Plans call for Magellan to formally start its $744 million
mission to use radar to makes maps and pictures of Venus'
cloud-covered surface late this month, Wall said.
   But unless the tape playback reveals an unforeseen problem,
Magellan's radar will be turned on Friday and tested Saturday. If
all goes well and Magellan produces more highly detailed pictures,
officials might simply declare afterward that the formal mapping
mission started Saturday.
   One of the pictures released Wednesday shows a basalt lava flow
11 miles wide and at least 15} miles long. It has lobed edges, is
extremely rough, and probably flowed in a ``thick, pasty'' manner
before it solidified, Saunders said.
   Another picture shows at least two volcanic calderas, similar to
those in the summit area of broad shield volcanoes such as Mauna
Loa and Kilauea on Hawaii. The largest measures 5 miles long by 2.2
miles wide.
   Calderas on Earth usually are much larger than typical volcanic
craters. Hawaiian, Icelandic and apparently the Venusian calderas
were created when lava flowed from vents on the flanks of
volcanoes, causing their summits to collapse.
   Earth's biggest calderas were formed by extraordinarily
explosive eruptions. Examples include calderas at Yellowstone
National Park in Wyoming and at California's Long Valley-Mammoth
Lakes resort area.
   A third new Venus picture shows a valley, about six-tenths of a
mile wide, that formed when a block of land dropped down between
two faults as the area was being stretched apart, Saunders said.
The valley cuts through a series of older ridges and valleys, but
was partially flooded by later lava flows.
   Similar fault-bounded valleys are found in California, East
Africa and Germany.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus after traveling a looping
948-million-mile path since its from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.

   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held talks
with King Hussein on the gulf crisis Wednesday, and the PLO's
Executive Committee issued a statement condemning the U.S. military
buildup in the region.
   Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, held two
rounds of talks with the Jordanian monarch before leaving Amman,
said the PLO's representative in Jordan, Al-Tayeb Abdul-Rahim.
   He would not disclose Arafat's next destination, citing security
considerations.
   Arafat and Hussein have supported Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
during the crisis while seeking to play a mediating role.
   Abdul-Rahim said the two ``discussed the recent developments in
the gulf and the dangers threatening Arab national security in view
of the foreign military buildup in the gulf Arab region.''
   He said they also assessed the outcome of Sunday's superpower
summit between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Helsinki, Finland.
   Arafat and Hussein ``supported all efforts for a peaceful
settlement of the gulf conflict and those aimed at preventing a
military explosion in the region,'' Abdul-Rahim said.
   Hussein has been holding numerous meetings at home and abroad in
recent weeks after pledging to seek a diplomatic solution to the
crisis, triggered by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   A statement released by the PLO's Executive Committee at the
group's headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, deplored the U.S.-led
military buildup in the gulf region.
   It also criticized the United States for separating the gulf
crisis from the Palestinian question.
   ``The United States continues to beat the war drums, to
concentrate more and more American and foreign forces to prepare an
aggression against brother Iraq,'' said the statement.
   The Executive Committee called for ``an Arab political
solution'' to the crisis.
   The PLO has supported Saddam against potential threat from
foreign forces, but has also condemned the invasion of Kuwait.
   The PLO has circulated a peace plan calling for the withdrawal
of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and U.S. forces from Saudi Arabia, and
the dispatch of an Arab and U.N. peacekeeping force to Kuwait until
elections could be held in the oil-rich emirate.
   Echoing Saddam, the PLO also has accused the United States of
hypocrisy in demanding enforcement of U.N. resolutions calling for
an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait while tolerating Israel's refusal to
comply with resolutions calling for an end to the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Bush's Request to Dismiss S&amp;L Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge has denied Neil
Bush's request to dismiss the government's case against him for
alleged conflict of interest in his role as a former director of a
collapsed Colorado thrift, the government disclosed Wednesday.
   Judge Daniel J. Davidson turned down Bush's petition in an order
issued Tuesday. The Office of Thrift Supervision, which is seeking
to bar the president's son from working for any bank or savings and
loan, made Davidson's decision public late Wednesday.
   Bush, 35, was an outside director of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that failed in late 1988 at a
cost to taxpayers estimated at $1 billion.
   In written arguments submitted to Davidson late last month, Bush
said there was no possibility that he could continue the alleged
abuses since Silverado already has been taken over by the
government. Bush continued to deny any wrongdoing.
   The judge rejected Bush's argument in his one-page order, saying
it is not supported by existing regulations and case law.
   Bush's attorney, James Nesland, did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking comment. Bush and Nesland have maintained
that the regulators' actions are politically motivated.
   Davidson's decision clears the way for a public hearing that has
been scheduled before him starting on Sept. 25 in Denver. Following
the hearing, the judge is expected to make a recommendation to the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, Timothy Ryan.
   In its response to Bush's request, the office had told Davidson
in a brief filed Monday that Bush could become a director at
another financial institution and repeat the conduct that harmed
Silverado.
   ``Indeed, throughout these proceedings (Bush) has evinced no
willingness to consider that he has done anything wrong, nor even
any understanding that he ever had potential conflicts of
interest,'' the thrift agency's brief said.
   The office said it wa clear that Bush's conduct ``was contrary
to generally accepted standards of prudent operation'' and could
cause harm to any financial institution if continued.
   The regulators have accused Bush of conflict of interest for not
disclosing his business ties to two big Silverado borrowers,
developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters.
   Bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering filing against him
and other former directors of Silverado.

<HEAD>Opponents Accuse Mulroney of Attempting to Pack Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Wednesday
appointed two new members to the Senate, and opponents accused him
of attempting to pack the legislative chamber in order to win
approval of an unpopular tax measure.
   Mulroney appointed John Buchanan to the Senate moments after he
quit as Nova Scotia premier amid allegations of a patronage scandal.
   Also named to the upper chamber was Noel A. Kinsella of
Fredericton, New Brunswick, the former president of the Canadian
Human Rights Commission.
   The latest appointments raise the number of Mulroney's recent
Senate nominations to 10.
   Buchanan's appointment drew particular scorn from opposition
leaders.
   ``It's cynicism to the utmost,'' said Liberal House Leader
Jean-Pierre Gauthier.
   Mulroney's government has been frustrated by the upper chamber's
refusal to pass his proposed 7 percent goods and services tax. He
has been appointing new Senate members in an effort to whittle away
the Liberal majority.
   There are 52 Liberals in the 104-seat Senate, along with 41 of
Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives, and six independents or
members of smaller parties.
   The latest appointments leave five vacancies. The prime minister
can also use an obscure constitutional provision to add as many as
eight new Senate seats.
   Liberal Senator Sid Buckwold, chairman of the committee studying
the tax measure, warned Mulroney against packing the Senate with
extra members to speed passage of the unpopular tax.
   ``That would be one of the greatest political blunders of all
time,'' Buckwold said.
   It's expected that his committee will recommend changes to
Mulroney's proposed consumption tax.
   Buchanan's appointment came as a surprise.
   Buchanan's provincial government has come under fire in recent
months after a former deputy minister, Michael Zareski, raised
allegations of corruption.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been investigating
Zareski's claims that Buchanan was at the center of a wide net of
patronage and payoffs.
   Buchanan, a 59-year-old Progressive Conservative, was elected
premier of Nova Scotia in October 1978.
   Kinsella, 50, was most recently a deputy minister in the new
federal multiculturalism department and has been a member of
Canadian delegations to several U.N. bodies.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday threatened to veto
a major anticrime bill nearing action in the House unless lawmakers
strengthen its death penalty features and other major provisions
designed to aid police.
   ``The bottom line is really this: I will not sign a crime bill
that handcuffs the police,'' Bush told prosecutors gathered in the
Rose Garden as the House positioned its bill for floor action.
   Bush renewed his criticism of Congress for refusing to act on
major portions of his anticrime program, saying they were needed to
``fight back against the epidemic of violent crime still raging in
America.''
   A leading sponsor, Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., said on Capitol
Hill later the bill had a few defects that he would attempt to iron
out on the floor. But he argued the bill was strong overall and
added, ``It's just unfortunate that once again we have seen a crime
bill disintegrate into partisan posturing.''
   The House bill calls for capital punishment for 10 offenses
ranging from presidential assassination to treason and sets a
time-limit on filing some kinds of appeals.
   It also calls for tougher penalties for drug offenses along with
a mixed bag of law enforcement measures ranging from scholarships
for police to a ban on state lotteries based on sporting events.
   The Bush administration has been critical, saying provisions
designed to end long delays in carrying out executions would
actually do the opposite. It said a provision allowing
death-penalty appeals based on racial statistics would effectively
wipe out capital punishment in America.
   Bush and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh suggested that
formulas drawn up on Capitol Hill could be more helpful to
criminals than to law enforcement.
   Thornburgh was asked why lawmakers would draft a bill helpful to
criminals. ``They may have been mistaken; they may have been overly
idealistic; they may have been naive,'' he said.
   Bush told prosecutors visiting in Washington to lobby against
the House bill that ``for the past two weeks America has been
gripped by chilling headlines that tell of kids going back to
school in bulletproof coats. ...''
   He recalled how ``a visiting Utah man _ a kid, really _ sports
lover _ (was) killed while defending his mother from a New York
subway gang said to be after pocket money so they could go
dancing.''
   ``The American people really are fed up,'' Bush said. `` ... And
I urge the Congress to heed the voices of our people, our police
and our prosecutors, and send me a crime bill that will help take
back the streets.
   Unlike the president's package and legislation passed by the
Senate, the House bill does not contain major provisions designed
to curb firearms. But sponsors of such measures were hoping to add
them on the floor.
   If they fail to do that, the House plans to take up a separate
bill that would ban domestically made semiautomatic assault rifles
not designed for sporting purposes. The Senate bill would ban nine
specified assault weapons.
   The president's plan would ban ammunition clips containing more
than 15 rounds.

<HEAD>Police Chief Fired After Indictment on Misdemeanor Perjury Count</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police chief was fired Wednesday after he was
indicted for allegedly lying to a panel investigating his dismissal
of an officer.
   Mack Vines was charged with one misdemeanor perjury count by a
Dallas County grand jury and fired by City Manager Jan Hart. Vines,
52, chief for two years, had been suspended with pay last month.
   The grand jury rejected the district attorney's recommendation
that Vines be indicted on seven felony perjury counts.
   ``I am surprised and saddened by the precipitous action that has
been taken by the Dallas city manager. I plan to ... fight the
minor legal charge returned by the grand jury,'' Vines said in a
statement.
   At a news conference, Ms. Hart said the dismissal was in the
best interests of the city. ``The issue is really one ... of public
confidence and trust,'' she said.
   Prosecutors had urged felony charges against Vines for
statements he made in August to a panel investigating the firing of
Dallas police officer Patrick LeMaire. Details of his testimony
were not released.
   LeMaire was fired in June 1989, about two weeks after he killed
a Mexican man. He was reinstated last July by a civil service panel
that said Vines did not justify the dismissal. He did not rejoin
the Dallas force.
   Assistant District Attorney Ted Steinke said Wednesday that he
thought the evidence was sufficient to convict Vines on the felony
charges, but he would not contest the grand jury's decision.
   ``The grand jury has spoken. They have acted as the conscience
of the community,'' Steinke said. ``We respect that decision.''
   Vines faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $2,000
fine if convicted.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency announced Wednesday a pilot program for treating wastewater
so it can be used to irrigate trees.
   Speaking before a meeting of the Interamerican Association of
Sanitary and Environmental Engineering, EPA regional director
Constantine Sidamon Eristoff said the program would ``put to use
new technology in wastewater disposal and at the same time provide
a new energy source.''
   He said the trees would be used for firewood.
   Eristoff said the water would be used for irrigation only after
secondary treatment. Primary treatment removes solids from the
water, while secondary treatment disinfects it.
   Eristoff said the program would be implemented next year on the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques and the eastern Caribbean island of
St. Lucia.
   He said the EPA is working with the United Nations Environmental
Program to come up with a policy for water standards in the
Caribbean region.
   The United Nations and the EPA will hold a conference on water
quality for the whole Caribbean region in November, he said.
   Eristoff is the director for Region 2 of the EPA, which covers
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

<HEAD>Law And Order of Priority: Chief Makes Crime List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FITCHBURG, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For police Chief Edward Gallant it was a
pretty simple equation: more crime and less money to pay overtime.
So, he made a list of crimes in order of severity and ordered his
force to work from the top down.
   That's when he ran up against another simple fact: Some
residents of this city of 40,000 about 40 miles northwest of Boston
were not prepared to hear that their police department was no
longer a phone call away.
   The policy requires residents to go to the police station report
cases of minor assault or petty larceny, rather than calling an
officer to their homes.
   Gallant, whose department of about 70 received 26,000 calls last
year, said prioritizing has been a fact of life for more than two
years in Fitchburg.
   But the formal list, released last month, prompted some
complaints.
   ``I've definitely found that the response has been that they
would have rathered that I didn't say anything,'' Gallant said last
week. ``People have to face reality and this is certainly reality
and I had to provide reasonable guidelines to my people.''
   Councilman Bernard Foley said the policy should have been
debated by council before being implemented and perhaps volunteers
could help bolster the force.
   ``I think the kind of comments I'm getting (from residents) is
they're not all that happy with some of the delays that may result
for some of the lesser priority actions,'' Foley said.
   The economic crisis gripping Massachusetts translated to a $1.2
million cut in Fitchburg, which has an overall budget of $45
million, said Mayor Jeffrey Bean, who supports the crime list.
   The police department has lost about $75,000 in overtime and has
been unable to hire more officers for the last three years, Gallant
said.
   Overall crime rates have increased about 10 percent over the
past few years, he said. In 1989 the city had two murders, 33
rapes, 58 robberies, 384 assaults, 570 burglaries, 1,340 larcenies
over $500, 200 auto thefts and 14 cases of arson.
   The department's list divides crime into seven ranked
``priority'' crimes and four ``non-priority'' offenses. The list
was written down to guide officers if they are swamped with calls.
   The seven priority crimes begin with felonies in progress
involving violence or potential violence and end with a misdemeanor
(not in progress) currently being reported with an identified
witness or complainant.
   Police also instituted a self-reporting system for the
non-priority offenses of vandalism and larceny below $250 and minor
assault, excluding domestic violence.
   Also on that list are shoplifting below $250 and a nonviolent
misdemeanor where the complainant declines to identify himself, for
example, anonymous calls reporting loud parties.
   Gallant said officers wasted the most time on noise complaints,
because so many callers were unwilling to let their neighbors know
they made the calls.

   Bush administration and congressional
bargainers considered a boost in the federal tax on cigarettes
Wednesday as they pushed with new optimism toward the end of
marathon talks to reduce the federal deficit, officials said.
   After months of deadlock, budget bargainers' positions have
moved toward each other and participants have begun to predict they
will soon produce a package cutting the deficit $50 billion next
year and $500 billion through 1995. Negotiators planned to work
non-stop until they either succeed or deadlock.
   ``I tend to be optimistic we'll reach a conclusion this week,''
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters during the
sixth day of talks at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, near
Washington.
   The two sides spent much of their time Wednesday discussing the
makeup of a package of tax increases to raise revenue toward
deficit reduction. They have already agreed to boost taxes by $25
billion next year and $130 billion over the next five years, but
sharp disputes over the specifics remain.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman proposed several new
taxes, officials said.
   One was a 1 percent tax on almost all petroleum products,
including gasoline, heating oil, chemical raw materials and the
hundreds of items that leave refinery gates. The tax would raise
$800 million next year and $7 billion over five years.
   Other taxes he suggested included a levy on luxury items,
including expensive automobiles, jewelry, furs, private planes,
boats and electronic equipment. Democrats have proposed taxing
similar items, but at a higher rate than Darman proposed. The
figures were not immediately available.
   Participants confirmed that they were discussing increasing
tobacco taxes. One official, asking to not be identified, said
bargainers were considering doubling the 16-cent-per-pack federal
tax on cigarettes. Such an increase would add an estimated $2.8
billion to government coffers next year.
   He indicated both parties have agreed to take responsibility
jointly for the proposal, which would be unpopular in tobacco
states as well as among smokers.
   Another official said the proposal was made by Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, although Archer later said the idea had come from a
Democrat. But this official expressed uncertainty over the amount
of the proposed increase.
   The same official said the two sides, which have previously both
proposed increasing alcohol taxes, were trying to agree to the
amount of the boost.
   The Bush administration was also beginning to indicate it was
willing to accept some type of tax on energy, this official said.
Democrats have proposed putting a 4 percent sales tax on various
fuels, and on increasing the 9-cent-per-gallon federal levy on
gasoline by 11 cents.
   Another major battle was waged over President Bush's proposal to
cut the tax rate on capital gains. Bush says lowering that levy,
which is imposed on the sales of property, will boost government
revenues by encouraging people to sell.
   But Democrats continued to insist that such a reduction would do
nothing but reduce federal tax collections and hand the proceeds to
wealthy property owners.
   ``There is a dispute about capital gains that continues ... that
comes, in our view, under the heading of fairness,'' Foley said.
   Democrats said they would not accept a capital gains tax
reduction unless Republicans accept higher income taxes on the
rich, a change the GOP opposes.
   Among the newest Democratic proposals is one that would increase
by 20 percent _ double their initial proposal _ the income taxes of
people earning more than $500,000 annually.
   The two sides are also trying to narrow differences over
domestic spending. Democrats want to limit reductions to about $90
billion over five years, while Republicans want cuts $40 billion
higher.
   Military spending, which would grow to $306 billion next year to
account for inflation, would be pared by $10 billion or $11 billion
under an agreement the bargainers are nearing. Over five years, the
saving would be $170 billion to $200 billion, with Republicans
championing the lower figure.
   If a deficit-cutting deal is not enacted by Oct. 1 _ the start
of fiscal 1991 _ the Gramm-Rudman law will slash overall spending
by $100 billion. Such a reduction in the $1.2 trillion budget would
be staggering to many individual programs, officials said.
   Also Wednesday, the bargainers were told that the massive
deficit they were fighting appears to be even bigger.
   Robert Reischauer, director of the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office, told the Senate Banking Committee that the fiscal
1991 deficit now looks $30 billion to $35 billion larger than it
did in June because of the weakening economy and rising oil prices.
In June, Reischauer projected the shortfall would be $232 billion.

<HEAD>Parental Consent Bill Speeds Through Legislature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A measure to require girls to obtain
parental consent for an abortion flew through the Michigan
Legislature on Wednesday, but abortion-rights activists pledged a
quick counterattack.
   The measure requires unmarried girls 17 and younger to have
permission from a parent or a judge to get an abortion. It will
become law 90 days after the last legislative session in December,
taking effect about April 1.
   The Legislature approved an identical bill earlier this year but
Gov. James Blanchard vetoed it. Right To Life of Michigan then
gathered about 330,000 signatures to put it back before the
Legislature, which took less than five hours to approve it.
   Because it began with a petition drive, Blanchard can't veto the
latest version.
   Barbara Listing, president of Right To Life of Michigan, said it
would encourage sexually active teenagers to use birth control.
Girls who do become pregnant will be able to get help, guidance and
support from their families in deciding what to do, she added.
   State Rep. Maxine Berman denounced the bill as ``a mean-spirited
shame. A lot of teen-agers are going to find themselves in horrible
positions because of this.''
   Katherine Spillar, national coordinator for the Fund for a
Feminist Majority, said laying the groundwork for a repeal effort
will start immediately.
   ``We will be organizing the outrage and the anger. We know it's
an uphill battle here,'' she said. ``When people understand what
will happen, we will turn public opinion around.''
   Repealing the law would take a vote of the people or another
vote by the Legislature. Spillar said her group hadn't decided
which route to follow.
   Liberal Democratic activist Zolton Ferency already has filed a
legal challenge to the measure. No hearing date has been set for
that lawsuit in Ingham County Circuit Court.
   Carol King, executive director of the Michigan Abortion Rights
Action League, said her group will start an effort to help pregnant
girls ask probate judges for permission for an abortion.
   She said she expected the measure would lead to an increase in
teen-age suicides and mothers, and dangerous back alley and
self-induced abortions.
   One of the measure's strongest Senate backers, state Sen. Fred
Dillingham, said it would allow parents to help their daughters.
   ``The parental rights in this doesn't prevent abortion. Parental
rights simply allow parents to guide their children through a very
traumatic time,'' he said.
   Blanchar, a Democrat seeking his third four-year term, has vowed
to veto any bill that restricts abortion rights.
   His Republican opponent, Senate Majority Leader John Engler,
opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to save the
life of the mother. He voted for the parental consent bill.
   The measure's speedy journey through the Legislature began with
a Senate committee meeting at which two Indiana parents, Bill and
Karen Bell, told how their 17-year-old daughter died after a
botched back alley abortion.
   ``Bill and I were just any Mom and Dad,'' Mrs. Bell said.
``We're saying if it can happen to us it can happen to any family.''
   States that currently enforce parental consent or notification
laws are: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.
   Parental consent bills are pending in several other states.

<HEAD>House Panel Preserves Covert Aid Programs for Angola, Cambodia,
Afghanistan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 5th graf: ``Another source,'' vote described as close
and aid amount</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The House Intelligence Committee approved
legislation Wednesday that largely preserves intact America's
controversial covert aid programs to rebels in Angola, Afghanistan
and Cambodia, sources said.
   The move, if upheld when the 1991 intelligence authorization
bill is considered by the full House, would put the committee at
odds with its Senate counterpart, whose members voted sharp cuts in
the Afghan and Cambodian programs, according to sources who
discussed the divergence on condition that they not be identified.
   A potential battle still looms in the House over aid to the
UNITA rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, who are fighting the
Soviet-backed government of Angola.
   One source said he expected members of the Congressional Black
Caucus, who oppose aid to the UNITA rebels, to demand an open
debate on the secret military assistance.
   Another source said the vote was ``really close.'' He said the
panel approved the administration's request of about $60 million
for UNITA.
   In its version of the intelligence bill the Senate left the
UNITA question open, deferring it until the House-Senate conference
on the bill.
   While most of the bill is secret, it is belived to authorize
roughly $30 billion for programs ranging from support for the three
rebellions to spy satellites.
   The program of aid to the non-communist resistance in Cambodia,
two rebel groups fighting the Vietnamese-installed government of
Hun Sen, is believed to total about $13 million a year. The Senate
panel eliminated the program in its version of the bill.
   For Afghanistan, the Senate committee voted a cut of about $100
million in the nearly $300 million annual support for the
mujaheddin rebels.
   Both moves reflect a growing distaste on Capitol Hill for covert
proxy wars, and an erosion of the old Cold War rationale for many
of the regional conflicts.
   One member of the panel, declining to discuss the committee's
action, said nevertheless that he was annoyed by the heavy lobbying
he had been subjected to on the Angola issue. It was clear from the
number of lobbyists involved that the matter is far too open to be
a ``covert'' program, he said.
   Savimbi since 1986 has used a well-financed lobbying operation
to build support for his forces in Congress. Current aid is
estimated at $60 million or more.
   An Angolan official lobbying to defeat the aid had been telling
members of Congress and the administration this week that
right-wing South Africans, with the tacit approval of their white
minority government, are providing the U.S.-armed rebels with
weapons.
   Maj. Gen. Roberto Leal Monteiro, chief military adviser to
Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, also argued that
further U.S. aid to the rebels prolongs the 15-year civil war in
his country.
   He said two ships from South Africa recently docked at the port
of Matadi in Zaire and unloaded two Puma helicopters and a group of
uniform-clad black Angolan mercenaries or rebels.
   South Africa was Savimbi's biggest arms supplier until last
year, when it agreed to stop as part of a regional peace plan.
   But, Monteiro said, the government has turned a blind eye to
some activities of radicals in the region, including their regular
flights ferrying weapons to the Angolan rebels via an air strip in
Lubumbashi, Zaire.
   Monteiro is arguing that his government has done all the United
States has asked _ agreeing to hold multiparty elections and
changing to a market-oriented economy _ and yet the administration
keeps aiding Savimbi.

<HEAD>Prosecution: Gross Negligence Behind Zeebrugge Ferry Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gross negligence by a ferry company and seven
former employees caused a 1987 ferry disaster in which 193 people
were killed, the prosecutor said Wednesday in opening arguments in
the manslaughter trial.
   P and O European Ferries, three former directors and four former
crew member have pleaded innocent.
   The car and passenger ferry overturned on March 6, 1987, in the
Belgian port of Zeebrugge with 454 passengers and 80 crew on board.
The ship had set sail minutes earlier for Dover, south England,
with its main car deck doors open.
   Charges in the 12-page indictment center on the ``obvious and
serious risk'' posed by sailing with the bow doors open and the
alleged reasons why they were not closed.
   The trial is considered a test case. Relatives of the victims
fought for more than three years to bring what is believed to be
only the second charge of corporate manslaughter against a British
company. In the first case, a construction company was acquitted in
a 1965 hearing.
   To keep the case simple, the accused are charged with the
unlawful killing of one victim, 27-year-old Alison Gaillard.
   The trial began Monday, and Prosecutor David Jeffreys outlined
his case Wednesday.
   He said 154 passengers and 38 crew died when the ferry sank. The
death of a person who died later is the subject of a separate civil
action.
   Jeffreys said the defendants either ``gave no thought to the
possibility of there being any risk or, having recognized there was
some risk, went on to take it and behaved with gross negligence.''
   ``You don't have to be a maritime expert to see what it meant to
sail with those bow doors open,'' he told the jury. ``The ... case
is that the capsize was avoidable.''

<TEXT>
   The FBI on Tuesday arrested a Mohawk
wanted for allegedly blocking off a New York reservation to keep
federal authorities out after a helicopter passing overhead was
targeted by gunfire.
   Michael R. Thomas, 32, of Altona, N.Y., was surrounded by FBI
agents and a contingent of local police outside a cafe and
surrendered without resisting.
   Three other Mohawks, who said they were from Kahnawake, Quebec,
were taken into custody and later released. Thomas was scheduled to
appear Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Hugh Morgan.
   He was indicted in northern New York state after the March 30
shooting of the Vermont National Guard helicopter over the
Ganienkeh Indian Territory near Plattsburgh, N.Y., about 150 miles
north of Albany.
   A doctor aboard the aircraft was wounded.
   Mohawks, who contend they have jurisdiction over criminal
investigations on reservation lands, barred federal authorities for
11 days. Indians armed with assault rifles manned roadblocks and
barricades.
   Ultimately, authorities were allowed onto Ganienkeh to
investigate the shooting for a couple of hours. No arrests in the
shooting have been made.
   Thomas was one of 16 people indicted for allegedly resisting and
impeding an FBI search.
   The four Indians were in Key West for two or three days and had
been under surveillance since Monday, FBI spokesman Paul Miller
said. No weapons were found, he added.
   The Indians may be members of the Mohawk warrior society, a
self-proclaimed Indian security force that has skirmished with
authorities in Canada and the United States, he said.
   Mohawks from the Kahnesatake reservation have been embroiled in
a standoff with Quebec police and the Canadian Army since July over
the attempt by Oka officials to expand a golf course onto land the
Indians considered sacred.
   An early confrontation in the standoff erupted in gunfire that
left a policeman dead.
   In solidarity with Mohawks in Oka, about 18 miles northwest of
Montreal, Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal set
up a barricade on the Mercier Bridge in Montreal. The Mercier is a
key commuting bridge in the city. That barricade finally came down
two weeks ago and the bridge reopened last week.
   The Quebec government on Tuesday rejected an offer from Mohawks
holed up Oka to end a two-month impasse by surrendering. In a brief
statement by Premier Robert Bourassa, the government called the
proposal ``unacceptable'' because it ``contradicts fundamental
principles of democracy and our justice system.''
   The Mohawk offer hinged on creation of a special commission that
would exercise ultimate authority for determining any criminal
charges. The panel would produce a final report within 60 days.
   ``We've gotten information recently through our legal attaches
in Ottawa and contact with the (Quebec) provincial police that
Thomas and other individuals may be involved in the incident at Oka
or the Bridge,'' Miller said.
   Key West police had closed off local streets before the FBI and
special weapons officers moved in to make the arrests, Miller said.
Florida Marine Patrol and Florida Department of Law Enforcement
teams helped with the surveillance.

<TEXT>
   The highest-ranking officer
accused in the murder of six Jesuit priests was relieved from his
command more than a month before authorities acknowledged his
implication, the judiciary said Wednesday.
   The judiciary issued a statement giving details on closed-door
hearings held on the murder case.
   The statement raised questions as to when members of the high
command learned of Col. Guillermo Benavides' alleged involvement in
the massacre.
   President Alfredo Cristiani announced on Jan. 13 the names of
the nine men _ Col. Benavides, three lieutenants and five soldiers
_ charged with the killings. The priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter were slain before dawn on Nov. 16.
   The president and top military authorities have said the
suspects were identified through the work of an armed forces
``honor commission'' formed Jan. 5.
   The judiciary statement said Lt. Col. Juan Velasco testified
Monday before an investigating judge that he replaced Benavides as
commander of security for the sector encompassing the Defense
Ministry and the Military College ``at the beginning of December.''
   Benavides was director of the Military College.
   The sector also included the Central American University, where
the slain priests taught and lived.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora asked Velasco if, at the time he took over
Benavides' command, he knew of Benavides' implication in the
massacre.
   ``I do not remember,'' the communique quoted Velasco as saying.
Velasco is currently commander of the Bracamonte elite infantry
battalion.
   The office of Defense Minister Col. Rene Emilio Ponce said he
was unavailable for comment on why Benavides was removed from the
command only three weeks after assuming it.
   Ponce was chief of the joint chiefs of staff last November.
Velasco said his order to replace Benavides came from the joint
chiefs.
   U.S. Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., heads a bipartisan commission
overseeing the investigation into the Jesuits' murders.
   He issued a statment last month saying ``Salvadoran military
officers have withheld evidence, destroyed evidence, falsified
evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in testimony before the
judge.''
   U.S. legislators have said the amount of future economic and
military aid to El Salvador depends in part on a successful
investigation into the massacre and punishment of those responsible.

   Capital: Riyadh
   Government: Monarchy
   Arabia was united for the first time by Mohammed, in the early
7th century. His successors conquered the entire Near East and
North Africa, spreading Islam and the Arabic language.
   Arabia fell under Turkish rule in the 18th century. In 1913 Ibn
Saud, founder of the Saudi dynasty, overthrew the Turks and took
the Hejaz in 1925. The Hejaz contains the holy cities of Islam _
Medina where the Mosque of the Prophet enshrines the tomb of
Mohammed, who died in 632, and Mecca, his birthplace. Puritanical
Islam prevails.
   Leader of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia has oil
reserves estimated at 255 billion barrels.
   The Saudis have permitted and will pay for most of the large
deployment of U.S.-led military forces in their nation to try to
prevent any aggression by Iraq.

   Capital: Ankara
   Government: Republic
   Before World War I the Turkish Ottoman Empire ruled what is now
Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the islands in the
Aegean Sea. Turkey allied itself with Germany and Austria during
World War I and their defeat resulted in the loss of much territory
and the fall of the sultanate. A republic was declared in 1923. An
ally of the United States, Turkey has played host to American
planes and supplies in the present crisis.

<HEAD>JORDAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Population: 3,031,000
   Area: 37,737 square miles
   Capital: Amman
   Government: Constitutional monarchy
   Jordan was conquered by the Arabs in the 7th century and by the
Ottoman Turks in the 16th century. Britain's 1920 Palestine Mandate
installed an emir of an autonomous Transjordan, covering two-thirds
of Palestine. An independent kingdom was proclaimed in 1946.
   Situated between Iraq and Israel, Jordan is in a dangerous
position in the present crisis. Dependent on Iraq as his major
trading partner and for all oil imports, King Hussein has
nevertheless agreed in principle to adhere into the U.N. embargo on
trade with Iraq. Refugees have fled from Iraq and Kuwait to Jordan
by the thousands, straining the already precarious economy.

<HEAD>IRAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Population: 51,005,000
   Area: 636,293 square miles
   Capital: Tehran
   Government: Islamic Republic
   Turks and Mongols ruled Iran, formerly known as Persia, in turn
from the 11th century until 1502 when a native dynasty reasserted
full independence. The past ruling dynasty was founded by military
leader, Reza Khan, in 1925. Following his abdication in 1941, Shah
Reza Pahlavi ruled until his ouster by Moslem fundamentalist in
1979.
   Iran and Iraq were at war from 1980-81. The war tentatively
ended with a cease-fire in August 1988. Facing mounting
international isolation after its seizure of Kuwait, Iraq has
sought a formal settlement with Iran.

   Syria was the center of the Seleucid empire but was absorbed by
the Roman and Arab empires. Ottoman rule prevailed for four
centuries, until the end of World War I.
   Syria was formed from Turkish districts, made a separate entity
by treaty in 1920 and administered by France until 1941, when the
French declared Syria a republic. Full independence came in 1944.
   After decades of anti-Western policy, Syria is working with the
United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf crisis.

   The seven Trucial Sheikdoms gave Britain control of defense and
foreign relations in the 19th century. They merged to become an
independent state in 1971. Oil revenue and international banking
combine to give the UAE one of the world's highest per capita GNPs
in the world at $23,000 per year.
   The UAE, a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, is strongly

   Oman has a long history of rule by other nations including
Portugal in the 16th century until its ouster by the Persians in
1744. In the early 19th century Oman controlled much of the Persian
and Pakistani coasts.
   Oman has vast oil reserves as its major source of income. A

   Qatar was under Bahrain's control until the Ottoman Turks took
control from 1872 to 1915. In 1916, Qatar signed a treaty giving
Britain responsibility for its defense and foreign relations. When
Britain removed its military forces from the region in 1971, Qatar
declared itself independent. Oil reserves of 3.3 million barrels
give Qatar a per capita income of $27,000.
   A member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Qatar is aligned with

   Civilization in Egypt dates to 4,000 B.C. A host of conquerors _
Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Arab _ ruled until the
Ottoman Empire took control in 1517. Egypt was a British
protectorate from 1914 to 1922, and while a 1936 treaty
strengthened Egyptian autonomy, the British maintained military
forces there until Egypt abrogated the treaty in 1951.

mainstay of the economy until oil was discovered in 1932. By the
1970s the oil was depleted, but international banking thrived.
   Bahrain is firmly anti-Iraqi and since well before the present

   North Yemen and South Yemen merged in May. By merging they
regained their former status as part of ancient Arabia Felix and
the kingdom of Sheba that lasted for 800 years until the 2nd
century B.C. For the next 800 years it was ruled by the Himyarites,
Ethiopians and Persians until Islam arrived in the 7th century. In
1517 South Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain seized
Aden in 1839 and the surrounding territory later became a British
protectorate.
   Aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign, and
South Yemen became the Arab world's only self-proclaimed Marxist
state. The northern Yemen Arab Republic was established in 1962
after an Egyptian-supported revolution ousted the Saudi
Arabian-backed Imam.
   Yemen has said it will abide by the U.N. embargo but seems
sympathetic to Iraq nonetheless.

<HEAD>Iraq Censors CNN Report, Rivals Say It Happens to Them, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

   Iraqi officials censored a CNN report Wednesday
in which a woman who had been trapped in Kuwait said Iraqis killed
people simply because they had pictures of the country's deposed
emir.
   As in previous cases, the report was censored by fast-forwarding
past the woman's comments during the report's satellite
transmission from Baghdad, making her words unintelligible, a Cable
News Network spokesman said.
   However, correspondent Tom Mintier, who filed CNN's report from
Baghdad, called a colleague in Jordan with his recollection of the
woman's comments, which was relayed to CNN in Atlanta for a later
broadcast, CNN said.
   The woman, whose name was not released, was on a London-bound
charter flight filled with foreigners who had been trapped in
Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of that country, said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth.
   She was interviewed during the flight's stopover in Baghdad, he
said.
   The woman was quoted as saying that ``they (Iraqis) are killing
them for having pictures of the emir and paper flags the kids have
for school. They are killing them for this. It's getting really
bad.''
   The woman apparently referred to Kuwaitis and paper replicas of
the flag of Kuwait, he said.
   Iraqi censorship of U.S. network reports, occuring even as Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein continues to try to portray himself
positively on television, is neither unusual nor yet excessive,
network officials say.
   ``It's a common experience among all the networks,'' said Ed
Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering.
   Turner said another network's shot of baking pita bread was
censored and yet another ``had a sound bite from Saddam himself,
and that was fast-forwarded.''
   CNN has been censored about six times, which is ``not so many as
to be onerous, but it is annoying,'' Turner said.
   Each time, including Wednesday, CNN showed the full report as it
was received from Baghdad, but noted which parts were censored.
   Iraqi officials seem more concerned with pictures than words,
although Wednesday's incident involved both.
   NBC News foreign editor David Miller said since last week, three
taped NBC reports, all about hostages, were censored during
satellite transmission.
   The correspondent's words were not altered, but the picture was
blurred, he said.
   Each time, the ``NBC Nightly News,'' aired the full report.
   Iraqi censors seem most sensitive to reports on hostages, said
CBS foreign editor Al Ortiz. But the censorship has not been so
severe ``that we haven't been able to...still manage to get the
story reported,'' he said.
   Miller said there are no advance warnings from Iraqi officials
and they seem to have no rules.
   ``I don't think they have guidelines...there's no set of rules
the way the U.S. military (in Saudi Arabia) does it.''

   The United Auto Workers union has an array of
options open to it as national contract talks with General Motors
Corp. enter their final hours. Some of the strategies, if carried
out, carry potentially devastating effects for the U.S. economy.
   In a nutshell, the union has three choices: Reach agreement
before the current contract expires at midnight Friday, extend the
current agreement beyond then or stage some kind of strike.
   It difficult Wednesday to accurately assess the chances of an
agreement before the deadline. However, union leaders in California
and Indiana said the UAW had scheduled a meeting Monday in Dearborn
of the GM bargaining council.
   That group typically would be briefed on a tentative agreement
before a ratification vote is taken. It was possible that the
council could be briefed on strike activities, but a UAW official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was more likely that
the leaders would discuss a settlement.
   The tone of negotiations since they began in mid-July has been
mostly cordial and calm, but some auto analysts have said for
months that a strike by the union against GM is likely.
   The UAW also is bargaining with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., but the union has put talks with those two companies on hold
pending the GM negotiations. In all, more than 450,000 active auto
workers are covered by UAW contracts with the Big Three, each of
which expires at the same time.
   With a strike fund of about $770 million, the union has the
fiscal flexibility to take a large number of the 300,000 GM workers
out of the company's plants for a long time.
   But the union may feel that such a labor bomb is unnecessary to
demonstrate its dissatisfaction with GM.
   The company, like other automakers, brings parts to its assembly
plants within hours of them being installed in vehicles. That means
even a small strike can take on huge proportions as it dries up the
parts pipeline.
   The UAW demonstrated that last month, when it staged a walkout
involving about 2,800 workers at GM's AC Rochester West plant in
Flint, where fuel tanks and other parts of GM cars and trucks are
made.
   When the supply of fuel tanks stopped, so did assembly plants.
   The strike was seen as a signal of what the union could do to
the automaker if national talks broke down.
   By the time the six-day strike was over, seven assembly plants
and portions of more than a dozen component factories had been shut
down, temporarily idling more than 20,000 workers.
   Whenever an assembly plant shuts down, layoffs ripple out.
Depending on how long production at an assembly plant is
interrupted, effects can be felt throughout the auto supplier
industry, including plastic, glass, rubber and steel makers.
   Negotiations in the auto industry come as the economy is slowing
down and predictions of a recession are growing.
   The government recently reported that unemployment in August
reached 5.6 percent, the highest in two years; annual growth of the
gross national product has dropped to 1.2 percent and many analysts
project it to fall further; and orders for durable goods, including
cars, have been flat.
   In 1970, an already-weak economy slipped into recession when the
UAW struck GM for 69 days, said Donald Ratajczak of the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta. At that
time, he said, GM played a much larger part in the economy than it
does now.
   ``Therefore, it (GM) by itself isn't going to take down the
economy,'' Ratajczak said Wednesday of this year's negotiations.
``Although it's a negative. We're being hit by negatives all over
the place.''
   He said the negotiations come ``at a bad time when consumer
psychology is hurting anyway. You start to run up the unemployment
rate (from a strike) and you'll kill Christmas.''
   A strike that slows production conceivably could help clear out
dealers' lots of unsold cars, but inventories are already at
optimum levels for this time of year, the dealers say.
   Auto dealers, struggling with slumping sales for nearly a year,
have been decreasing their orders to increase their profits.
Inventories of unsold new and used cars and truck stands between 55
and 60 selling days, according to Tom Webb, senior economist with
the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   Dealers would feel the effects of any kind of strike quickly,
Webb said. The uncertainty grows, he added, because at this time of
year, dealers are struggling to maintain a balance between supplies
of 1990-model cars and the new 1991 versions.
   ``If it's prolonged, you'll have a severe falloff in
inventory,'' Webb said. If that occurs at GM dealers, customers may
turn to competitors for their new vehicles.
   Should the choice be Japanese, the strike would fulfill the
worst nightmares of labor and management. The Japanese share of the
new-car market has grown from about 25 percent to close to 30
percent since the last contract agreement in 1987.

   A judge Wednesday issued a middle-of-the-night
order temporarily barring St. Martin's Press from distributing a
book about the Mossad, Israel's secret intelligence service.
   The Israeli government sought the ban of the book, ``By Way of
Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer.'' The
author, Victor Ostrovsky, claims to have been a Mossad operative in
the mid-1980s.
   Lawyers for the Israeli government argued that the book
contained information that could, in the language of the judge's
order, ``endanger the lives of various people in the employ of the
state of Israel, and would be detrimental to the government of the
state of Israel.''
   State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Dontzin signed the order
in his apartment at 1:05 a.m. after hearing from lawyers for Israel
and St. Martin's. Supreme Court in New York state is a trial-level
court, not a court of appeal.
   Dontzin said he would hear arguments Friday on whether to keep
the ban in effect.
   The judge ordered St. Martin's to tell bookstores that none of
the 17,000 copies shipped so far are to be sold.
   Ostrovsky's book says Mossad knew in advance about the terrorist
bombing that killed 240 U.S. Marines in Beirut in 1983 but said
nothing because it wanted relations between the United States and
Arab nations to worsen.
   The book also describes Mossad spying inside the United States.
   Roy Gainsburg, president of St. Martin's, denounced the order
and denied that anyone would be endangered by the book.
   ``Wherever the disclosure of a person's name might endanger
them, that name is not mentioned,'' Gainsburg maintained. ``We are
confident this book doesn't endanger anybody.
   ``It'll certainly embarrass a lot of people. But can you imagine
a book being banned in the United States because it's detrimental
to some other government? Or to the United States government, for
that matter? The First Amendment says you can be as critical as you
want about the U.S. government or any government.''
   A St. Martin's lawyer, John Lankenau, commented: ``There are
17,000 books out there already. Is any foreign intelligence agency
so inept that it can't get a copy?''
   Lankenau said he was filing an appeal of Dontzin's order.
   On Friday, Israel obtained a court order in Ontario barring
release of the book in Canada, where Ostrovsky, 40, was born and
now lives. The book's primary publisher, Stoddart Publishing Co.,
is Canadian.
   Ostrovsky, in an interview Wednesday in Canada with The
Associated Press, said two of his former Israeli commanders turned
up a week ago at his home in suburban Ottawa, first trying to buy
his silence, then threatening him.
   ``They said money was no object. They said it was for my own
good and the good of my family.'' Ostrovsky has a wife and two
daughters.
   ``They said that it's better for me that I don't write it. They
told me to stop it. They wanted to know if I still controlled it
(publication).'' He said he asked for police protection but was
refused.
   Gainsburg said nothing about Ostrovsky's book was heard in New
York until Tuesday, when lawyers representing Israel telephoned to
ask that copies not be shipped to U.S. sellers.
   The publisher said that when they learned several thousand books
already were out, the lawyers said they wanted to see a judge.
   He said Dontzin heard from lawyers for both sides for two hours
in his apartment, but received no evidence.
   ``They referred to an affidavit under seal in the Canadian court
in Ontario, which neither we nor the judge have ever seen,''
Gainsburg said. ``We do not know what that affidavit said, nor does
the judge.''
   A call to Dontzin seeking comment was not returned immediately.
   Jonathan Lerner, one of the lawyers for Israel, refused to
comment, saying: ``I don't want to make my legal arguments in the
press.''
   Asked about First Amendment implications, he said: ``If I didn't
feel there was precedent, I wouldn't have made the application.''
   At the Israeli consulate, spokesman Yuval Rotem said his
government would make no comment about a matter before a court.

   A Roman Catholic bishops' organization said
Wednesday it had asked the Bush administration to make sure the
trade embargo against Iraq does not cover essential food and
medicine for civilians.
   ``The moral justification for our intervention requires that we
maintain the distinction between the Iraqi regime and ordinary and
vulnerable Iraqi citizens,'' said a letter to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III from the chairman of the U.S. Catholic Bishops's
Committe on International policy.
   ``We urge that in the implementation of the embargo and other
sanctions against Iraq the utmost care and sensitivity be exercised
so that innocent civilians are not deprived of those essentials for
the maintenance of life, i.e., food and medicines,'' wrote the
committee chairman, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles.
   A United Nations sanctions committee could not agree on what
kind of food aid to allow into Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Most of
the delegates want to allow shipments only to foreigners and
children, while Cuba and Yemen called for a broader resolution
allowing in food to all civilians.
   Bush has said the United States favors ``humanitarian'' food and
medical shipments but has not spelled out what that should mean.

<HEAD>Four-Year-Old Girl Reported Killed While Fleeing Albania</HEAD>

   Albanian border guards shot and
killed a 4-year-old girl who was among a group of Albanians
attempting to cross illegally into Yugoslavia, the official
Yugoslav Tanjug news agency said Wednesday.
   Eighteen other Albanians, including an army officer and two
soldiers using a military boat, managed to safely flee to
Yugoslavia in the same escape attempt Tuesday, Tanjug said.
   The girl, identified as Anisa Gruda, was fatally shot when
border guards opened fire on the escapees while they were crossing
Lake Skadar on the Albanian-Yugoslav border.
   The report gave no further details.
   Albania, the last hard-line Communist nation in Europe, is at
odds with Yugoslavia over the fate of ethnic Albanians in the
Serb-controlled Yugoslav province of Kosovo. It frequently disputes
the accuracy of Yugoslav reports concerning Albania.
   In May, Albania announced a package of limited reforms,
including a liberalization of travel restrictions and the abolition
of the death penalty for those fleeing the country. In July, a
measure took effect allowing any adult to apply for a passport to
travel abroad.
   But despite the changes, about 70 Albanians illegally crossed
into Yugoslavia in July and August, according to Yugoslav
statistics.
   The refugees normally cite the harsh economic conditions in
Albania as their main reason for fleeing.
   Over 4,000 Albanians were allowed to leave for the West in July
after they took refuge in Western embassies in Tirana, the Albanian
capital. But authorities have since put up a wall around the
embassy district to prevent a similar incident.

<TEXT>
   Worried that Michigan is becoming a haven
for suicide after two widely publicized cases, a lawmaker said
Wednesday he'll sponsor a bill that would make it a felony to help
people kill themselves.
   ``We've had these examples of people traveling thousands of
miles to reach what is considered to be the safe state of Michigan
to perform assisted suicides. I think that is certainly a very
black eye on Michigan nationally,'' said Sen. Fred Dillingham.
   Michigan now has no law against assisted suicide. Murder laws
don't cover it, the state Court of Appeals has ruled.
   Janet Adkins, an Oregon woman who suffered from Alzheimer's
disease, traveled to suburban Detroit in June and committed suicide
using a machine developed by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Kevorkian hooked
her up to it, but Adkins pushed a button that sent lethal drugs
into her body. Kevorkian wasn't charged.
   Bertram Harper, 79, of California, faces trial on murder and
conspiracy to commit murder charges in the Aug. 19 death of his
wife, Virginia, 69, in a Detroit-area hotel. Harper told police he
pulled a plastic bag over her head after she took some sleeping
pills.
   ``Myself and others are very, very concerned about Michigan
continuing to be considered some type of suicide haven,''
Dillingham said. ``It's wrong and it needs to be stopped.''
   His legislation would make it a felony to help someone commit or
attempt to commit suicide. It would carry a maximum penalty of four
years in prison and a $2,000 fine. He said he would introduce the
measure this week.

<HEAD>Fujimori: Won't Sign U.S. Military Aid Agreement to Combat Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday he
would not sign an agreement with the United States for $35 million
in military aid to fight cocaine trafficking.
   Speaking at a press conference, Fujimori said Peruvian military
advisers ``consider it against our interests at this time'' to sign
the accord this year.
   The U.S. agreement was to have included $20 million to build a
training base near Peru's coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley and
provide arms and equipment for Peruvian soldiers.
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's principal supplier of coca
leaf, the raw material for cocaine. Political analaysts estimate
more than 1,000 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas operate in the
valley, a jungle region 250 miles northeast of Lima.
   The guerrillas provide protection for the drug traffickers in
exchange for money and weapons.
   The agreement had been drawn up by Washington and presented to
Fujimori's predecessor, Alan Garcia, who insisted the agreement be
accompanied by economic aid.
   Fujimori repeatedly warned he would not sign the agreement
unless it included economic aid to wean farmers from growing coca.
Fujimori stressed the need to develop alternative crops in the area
and build a paved highway to bring the products to markets on the
coast, where most of the populace lives.
   Fujimori said because the aid package ``is destined only for the
fight against drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this
agreement.''
   The aid package was planned for the 1990 fiscal year, which
concludes at the end of September. U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton
said in an interview with the news magazine Caretas this week that
if Peru ``does not sign the agreement, the aid would go to other
countries.''
   The Peruvian military is more preoccupied with the country's
10-year guerrilla war than with controlling Peru's annual $1
billion cocaine trade. In Peru, the police force is in charge of
the drug fight.
   Peruvian politicians have criticised the agreement, fearing it
could lead to direct U.S. involvement in a guerrilla war that has
left nearly 20,000 dead since 1980.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an
anti-drug base in the Huallaga Valley jointly with Peruvian police.
The Shining Path attacked the base in April.
   Fujimori's refusal to sign the agreement comes at a time when
Peru is reeling from tough austerity measures aimed at curbing
3,000 percent annual inflation.
   Fujimori, who was sworn in on July 28, inherited a moribund
economy and a huge government deficit generated by the freespending
government of Garcia.
   Fujimori is to travel to the United States at the end of
September for talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, according to the state news agency Andina.
   Quaynton said Fujimori may also meet with President Bush, Andina
said.

<HEAD>Protesters Delay Departure of Rebuilt Tanker</HEAD>

   The rebuilt Exxon Valdez returned to service
Wednesday, delayed a few hours by environmentalists who climbed
aboard its rudder and chained themselves to a boom near the ship.
   Nine Greenpeace protesters were arrested, charged with
misdemeanor suspicion of trespassing and disturbing the peace and
later released, said Arthur LeBlanc, chief of harbor police.
   The environmentalists said they used the departure of the ship,
renamed the Exxon Mediterranean, to protest the United States'
dependence on foreign oil and lack of energy-saving programs and
alternatives to fossil fuel.
   The tanker caused the country's worst oil spill when it ran
aground March 24, 1989, in Alaska's Prince William Sound, spilling
nearly 11 million gallons, killing scores of animals and fouling
hundreds of miles of coastline.
   ``We're trying to make a point that the Exxon Valdez represents
our addiction to oil, which will cause more spills like Prince
William Sound and also has us on the verge of war in the Persian
Gulf,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Kelly Quirke.
   ``The Exxon Valdez isn't the only tanker that's a danger to
coastlines around the world. There are hundreds of tankers out
there and they're all an accident waiting to happen.''
   Arrested were two protesters who handcuffed themselves to the
rudder and were removed by police, one in a rubber raft who tried
to put a banner on the ship and six swimmers chained to a boom set
around a 20-foot inflatable ``globe'' floating next to the tanker.
   After the two-hour protest, scuba divers checked the ship's hull.
   ``We did a routine sweep of the bottom, which we would have done
anyway to make sure the propeller wasn't fouled and to make sure
that no one had put anything in the propeller or the rudder
shaft,'' said Fred Hallett, a spokesman for National Steel &amp;
Shipbuilding Co.
   The tanker left the pier about four hours late and then waited
another 30 minutes in San Diego Bay for fog to dissipate.
   ``We regret this incident happened. Our desire (was) to get
underway and to launch the vessel on her initial voyage and to have
a timely and safe voyage,'' said Les Rogers, an Exxon spokesman in
Houston.
   The ship is to refuel in Singapore before continuing to the
Mediterranean. The company said it would carry oil from the Middle
East to Europe.
   After the Alaska spill, the 4-year-old ship returned to the
shipbuilding company's shipyard in San Diego _ where it was built _
for nearly a year of repairs totaling $30 million.
   Workers replaced one-third of its hull with 3,000 tons of new,
inch-thick steel. The 987-foot-long tanker holds nearly 1.4 million
barrels of crude oil. A barrel is 42 gallons.
   The ship was renamed the Mediterranean in July. Exxon officials
have denied that the change in name and base stemmed from the spill.
   Exxon officials said the tanker was too big for U.S. Pacific
ports, and declining production from Alaskan oil fields reduced the
need for such large tankers on the West Coast.

   Edward Lewis Humphrey's history of
mental illness, scarred face and fondness for knives helped make
him stand out in the search for the methodical killer of five
college students.
   But after nearly two weeks, authorities won't say for sure he's
their man.
   Police called for National Guard help for an intensive search
Thursday of 10 square miles near Humphrey's Gainesville apartment
in a search for evidence. Police refused to reveal what they are
looking for, but say the evidence they are seeking could rule out
or confirm Humphrey as a suspect.
   Also Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department approved a $941,639
emergency grant to help pay for the investigation. Much of the
money will be used for personnel costs, said Jon Peck, a spokesman
for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   While circumstantial evidence mounted against the 18-year-old
University of Florida freshmen, even those close to him wondered
about dramatic changes evident in the Eagle Scout and high school
honor student.
   Humphrey has been in the Brevard County jail in lieu of $1
million bond since Aug. 30 on unrelated charges, including one that
he beat his 79-year-old grandmother. He has not been charged in
connection with the Gainesville deaths.
   Normally, police won't publicly identify a suspect before an
arrest is made. But this is a high-profile case.
   ``He's the one we've received the most information about,'' said
police spokeswoman Lt. Sadie Darnell. ``So I think that's why he
became the focus _ rightly or wrongly.''
   Police searches of Humphrey's Gainesville apartment and
Indialantic home and car turned up six long-bladed knives, a
butcher knife hidden in a milk jug, a fishing gaff and an advanced
version of the fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons, The Orlando
Sentinel reported Wednesday. It said police are looking for
videotapes or audiotapes recording the slayings, human flesh and
photographs of the victims.
   Police have refused to discuss such details.
   Humphrey enjoyed dressing up in military clothes, strapping on a
knife and slipping into the woods around his apartment for
nighttime pseudo reconnaisance maneuvers, neighbors told police.
   Neighbors said he bragged he was going to fight in Saudi Arabia
and, three weeks before the slayings, he was found in a restricted
area on the Patrick Air Force Base near his home, walking in
circles and claiming to be a member of the elite 82nd Airborne
Division.
   He was freed without being arrested, a base spokesman said. But
two knives with 6-inch blades were confiscated from his car.
   ``He's not the same person he used to be,'' said friend Jeff
Deratany. ``He's not Ed Humphrey.''
   During high school in the upscale coastal town of Indialantic _
about 180 miles southeast of Gainesville _ Humphrey appeared to be
the All-American boy with looks, good grades, positions on the
student council and junior varsity football team. He hung around
with surfer buddies and dreamed of becoming a lawyer.
   Friends said the youngest of four children was emotionally
affected by his parents' bitter divorce about five years ago.
   Two years ago, when Humphrey was hospitalized for several weeks
with mononucleosis during his senior year at Melbourne High School,
he became severely depressed, telling friends he could ``smell
death.''
   Soon after that, Humphrey either fell or jumped from a car
traveling at 70 mph in Gainesville.
   The accident left him with a limp and months of therapy, stays
in mental health programs and a reliance on the drug lithium to
control mood swings, friends said.
   Last fall, near his Indialantic home, his car rammed a utility
pole and his face smashed into the windshield, leaving deep scars.
   Humphrey used to complain that the lithium left him groggy and
fat and sometimes he would stop using it.
   ``You could tell when he wasn't on it,'' said Erik Bedesem, 19,
an Indialantic resident who describes himself as Humphrey's best
friend. ``He was real aggressive and high strung.''
   Asked if Humphrey could have killed, he said: ``It's not
unbelievable.''
   In May, he enrolled in the first summer term at the University
of Florida and relatives said he did well.
   For a time, he lived at the Gatorwood Apartments where two of
the slayings occurred. Manager Carol Hyde said he was asked to
leave, but would not say why. A resident of the complex told The
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale that he had a crush on one of the
victims, 23-year-old Tracy Inez Paules.
   He is registered at the school this fall as a freshman with no
declared major.
   After his summer courses, he traveled to Montana. Friends said
he once had a romance there with a girl who had written to him
saying she was in love with someone else.
   His mother and grandmother alerted authorities in Montana to
find him and send him home.
   Ravalli County Montana Sheriff Jay Printz said Humphrey had a
Rambo complex. ``He was definitely an emotionally troubled young
man,'' he said. ``He just didn't have all his marbles together.''
   Humphrey started the fall semester on Aug. 25, the day before
two bodies were found. He was arrested five days later after
entered his grandmother's Indialantic home during the night and
yelled: ``You are going to hell and you are going to die.'' He
allegedly began choking her and pummeling her face, according to a
sheriff's report.
   ``I hit her and I'm sorry,'' he reportedly told deputies.
Grandmother Elna Hlavaty was treated for broken facial bones and a
swollen eye.
   Authorities have refused to comment on published reports that
Humphrey told investigators he knew who killed two victims and gave
a name police believe is one of his multiple personalities.
   A jail guard testified at a hearing last week that Humphrey
often referred to himself as John, saying ``John doesn't take no
prisoners.''

<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities have executed more than 500
people this year in the most severe crackdown on crime since 1983,
Amnesty International said in a report released Thursday.
   The London-based human rights group said that some people were
put to death within two weeks of their arrest.
   Amnesty International said 1,100 people are known to have been
sentenced to death in the last 12 months, but it said the actual
figure of those put to death is undoubtedly much higher.
   Amnesty, which opposes the death penalty as a matter of
principle, appealed earlier this month to Chinese Prime Minister Li
Peng to suspend the executions.
   The Amnesty report said almost all those sentenced to death this
year have been tried under emergency procedures that give them
little opportunity to prepare their defense.
   ``Trials are often a mere formality, with the verdict decided
beforehand and little chance for appeal or pardon,'' the report
said.
   Amnesty said the number of executions was the greatest since
5,000 or more people were killed in 1983 during a major anti-crime
campaign. against crime.
   ``The courts have been ordered to `severely crack down' on such
crimes as drug trafficking, embezzlement, gang robberies and theft
_ the fourth such sweeping attack on crime in the last eight
years,'' the report said.
   ``Despite the increase in death sentences, the level of crime
has not dropped in the last decade,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   A river flowing through Seoul burst
its embankment Wednesday following record-breaking rains,
triggering landslides and flooding dozens of villages. The death
toll from the storm reached 83, and 52 people were missing.
   The figures did not reflect casualties from an area west of
Seoul, where more than 80 villages disappeared in a sea of
torrential water unleashed when a 100-yard section of the Han River
embankment collapsed before dawn.
   Thousands of people awakened by the thundering water raced to
rooftops and higher ground. Thousands were ferried to safety in a
rescue effort involving 4,000 soldiers, dozens of helicopters and
hundreds of boats. American troops also helped rescue stranded
Koreans.
   ``It happened so suddenly, I couldn't get anything from my
house,'' said a woman eight months pregnant. ``I'm in a shelter and
I cannot find my family.''
   President Roh Tae-woo said Tuesday the relief efforts in this
city of nearly 10 million were like ``fighting a war.''
   ``No amount of words can describe this situation,'' said Police
Lt. Kim Sung-ho. ``It's hellish.''
   Fifteen inches of rain fell in the Seoul area Wednesday in one
of the heaviest single-day rainfalls on record here.
   The Central Disaster Relief Center said early Thursday that at
least 83 people had been killed in flooding and landslides and 52
people were missing. At least 100,000 people were homeless, and
damage was estimated at $82 million.
   The center officials said casualty figures were expected to rise
sharply as communication links were restored.
   Government officials said about 450 businesses were closed or
suspended operation due to rain damage. Government officials,
soldiers and militia men worked round the clock. Workers struggled
to strengthen a portion of the Han river bank in eastern Seoul near
the Olympic facilities after water leaked through a crack.
   In southern Seoul, the Choongang Hospital and its 900 patients
were stranded and surrounded by flood waters Wednesday. About 50
patients were transferred to a nearby hospital by boat, news
reports said.
   Two cruise ships broke free from their moorings and capsized on
the Han River on Tuesday. Twenty crewmen were rescued but 10 were
missing, police said.
   Hundreds of rescue workers dug into hillsides buried in mud to
dig out homes that had collapsed.
   In Inchon, west of Seoul, 16 bodies were recovered from nine
houses crushed in a landslide. The bodies of five monks were
recovered near a Buddhist temple where they had been praying.
   U.S. Air Force helicopters based at Osan, south of Seoul, flew
helicopters on 26 missions to rescue stranded civilians. Relief
workers said American military personnel plucked about 1,000
Koreans from rooftops.
   The torrential rains stopped during the night and the three-day
storm headed southward and out to sea.

   Isidore barely maintained its strength as a
hurricane Wednesday, but its punch still threatened North Atlantic
shipping lanes.
   Isidore steamed slowly through the mid-Atlantic with top
sustained winds of 75 mph. It was expected to veer to the
northwest, then north and eventually to the northeast over open
waters.
   ``It's a little south of the main North Atlantic shipping lanes
and will threaten shipping for the next couple of days,'' said
Richard Pasch, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center. He
said the storm should gradually weaken over the next few days.
   Isidore, which reached hurricane strength last Thursday but
dropped back to tropical storm status over the weekend, was about
1,160 miles west southwest of the Azores.
   The hurricane's center at 10:30 p.m. EDT was near 34.4 north
latitude and 50.7 west longitude. Isidore is moving toward the
north northwest near 5 mph.
   Isidore's hurricane-force winds extended 35 miles from the
center and tropical storm-force winds extended up to 175 miles.
   The threshold for a hurricane is 74 mph, and a tropical storm
has a threshold of 39 mph.

   A key figure and prosecution witness in the
Bensonhurst racial slaying was sentenced Wednesday to three years
probation on a misdemeanor drug charge.
   Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Alan Meyer also ordered Gina
Feliciano, 19, to seek treatment and counseling.
   Miss Feliciano pleaded guilty in July to one count of criminal
possession of a controlled substance. She had faced up to six
months of detention as a youthful offender.
   Miss Feliciano was arrested in May at a subway station for
failing to pay a fare. A paper bag containing 15 vials of crack
cocaine fell out of her purse when she reached in to get
identification, police said.
   Investigators also found a crack pipe in her bra, police said.
   Miss Feliciano was a star witness against Joseph Fama and Keith
Mondello, the first of the young whites convicted in the racially
motivated murder last August of Yusuf Hawkins, a black teen-ager.
   She said they were angry that she invited black and Hispanic
friends to her 18th birthday party. Hawkins went to the
neighborhood the night of the party to look at a used car.
   Fama was convicted of second-degree murder in the death and
Mondello was convicted of lesser crimes.

<TEXT>
   Florida's Lotto jackpot reached an
estimated $96 million _ the second largest ever in the country _
after hopeful players Wednesday bought tickets at a rate of up to
300 every second.
   ``Will we go to $100 million? Anything is possible,'' Lottery
Secretary Rebecca Paul said.
   The national record is $115 million awarded to 14 ticket-holders
in Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   Florida ticket sales accelerated after nobody picked all six
numbers to win a $50 million jackpot Saturday.
   By 5 p.m. Wednesday, Florida sold 9.5 million $1 tickets for the
day, at a rate of up to 300 every second, Lottery Department
spokesman Ed George said. Ticket sales are expected to increase
Friday and Saturday.
   Among Wednesday's players were a Tampa father and son who came
to Lottery Department headquarters in Tallahassee and bought 10,000
tickets. It took nearly seven hours for the lottery computer to
print out all the tickets.
   ``I saved up for it. I figured it would be a good use,'' said
Anthony Giardino, 21. He bought 2,000 tickets _ 500 for friends _
and his father, who would not speak to reporters, bought 8,000.
They chose the numbers on 800 tickets and had the computer pick the
rest at random.
   ``I figured I have a good chance of winning,'' Giardino said.
   In reality, the odds of winning the jackpot are about 1-in-14
million, lottery officials estimate.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was a $58 million jackpot
split between five winners in April.
   Florida Lotto also holds the world record for largest single
prize for a computerized numbers game, $55.1 million to Sheelah
Ryan of Winter Springs in September 1988.

<HEAD>Catholic Scholars Say Blocking Dissent Harms Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a period of hardening Vatican demands for
doctrinal conformity, two top American Catholic thinkers have
zeroed in on a specific case of enforcing it, and cried foul.
   They say the action was unjust in the first place, and that
continuing academic complicity in it is harmful not only to the
victim but to Roman Catholic higher education and to the church
itself.
   The protest amounts to a challenge both to ecclesiastical
authorities and to administrations of Catholic universities.
   It comes after a recent tightening by the Vatican of
prohibitions against dissent, but focuses on a 1986 case against
the Rev. Charles Curran, a prominent moral theologian ousted from
the Catholic University of America.
   Arguing the ouster was carried out by unjust means, the Rev.
Richard P. McBrien, theology department chairman at the University
of Notre Dame, and the school's noted Christian ethicist, the Rev.
Richard A. McCormick, charge:
   ``Continuing exclusion of Father Curran from Catholic college
and university theology faculties represents complicity in the
original injustice.''
   The two scholars say efforts have been made by various Catholic
theology departments to get Curran on the faculties, but ``he has
been positively excluded by upper administration.''
   Writing in the Sept. 8-15 issue of the Jesuit-edited national
Catholic weekly, America, the two scholars say:
   ``We regard this exclusion as a continuing complicity in the
original injustice done to Father Curran and as harmful not only to
him but also to Catholic higher education in this country and to
the church.''
   Most of Curran's theological colleagues ``would give their
proverbial right arms to get him'' on their faculties, but the
resistance comes from ``upper administrations which are afraid,''
the article says.
   ``It is at once unintelligible and inexcusable that Catholic
educators who know better should now have assumed the disturbing
role of accomplices to the original injustice _ an injustice not
only to Father Curran but to Catholic higher education and the
church he continues to serve so faithfully,'' the article adds.
   The Rev. George W. Hunt, America's editor in chief, said he
expected the essay to cause a great deal of reaction both in
ecclesiastical and educational circles.
   Curran was ousted after some of his views on sexual ethics, such
as defending contraception, were denounced by the Vatican's
doctrinal arbiter, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.
   Ratzinger ruled him neither ``suitable nor eligible'' to teach
Catholic theology. More than 750 American theologians signed a
statement supporting Curran's stature in his field.
   In the last three years, he has held teaching posts at secular
institutions, at Cornell University, the University of Southern
California and now Auburn University.
   At issue in the case was ``not the right of the church to teach
and to defend its teaching against error, but the proper scope and
use of that right,'' the article contends.
   It says Vatican interventions in such cases have been
``improperly and unjustly exercised'' and flout ``rights recognized
in modern societies'' by such practices as these: Both prosecuting
and judicial authorities are combined; the accused has no access to
documents touching on charges; the proceedings are in secret; there
is no right of appeal.
   ``In brief, the institutional structures and procedures are
unfair to start with,'' the article says.
   It says that for ``a professional theologian to be so
stigmatized by the church's highest authorities'' brands the person
as not to ``be trusted in the very profession to which he has
devoted his life.''
   That is ``extremely serious business'' and puts Curran's past,
present and future work ``under a cloud, his theological _ and to
some extent his personal _ reputation sullied,'' the writers say.
   This was done ``on the basis of a rationale that is new and
disturbing and that will not survive historical and theological
scrutiny,'' McBrien and McCormick contend.
   They say Catholic higher education could repair some of the
damage to itself if a prestigious Catholic university such as Notre
Dame, Boston College or Georgetown University offered Curran a
theology professorship.
   But the administrations are ``intimidated by the actual or
potential opposition,'' McBrien and McCormick write.
   They say the single reason given for the punishment was ``public
dissent,'' meaning only ``disagreement with an officially
formulated position,'' even if _ as in Curran's case _ the position
was not considered absolute or infallible.
   As an upshot to that case and others, Ratzinger last June, with
papal approval, banned public dissent by theologians from any
teaching of the church's magisterium, the pope and bishops, whether
regarded infallible or not.
   Declaring that Ratzinger's position ``represents a denial of the
legitimacy of public dissent in principle,'' McBrien and McCormick
say:
   ``The legitimacy of dissent from non-infallible teaching is not
an episcopal grant or concession . . . Rather, such legitimacy is
rooted in the imperfection and contingency of human knowledge.''

<HEAD>`60 Minutes,' Once Unsponsored, Starts 23rd Season on CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Sunday, ``60 Minutes'' starts its 23rd
season, having been No. 1 in the ratings twice last month, in the
Nielsen Top Ten club 13 consecutive seasons, and a solid
money-maker for CBS.
   It still starts with a ticking stopwatch, still usually has
three features a show and, by the reckoning of Don Hewitt, its
executive producer and founding father, still earns a tidy sum each
year.
   ``There were years when we made $70 million, years we made $50
million, years we made $40 million,'' he said. ``What we made last
year I don't know, I swear to God.''
   But when it began in 1968, sharing Tuesdays on an
every-other-week basis with ``CBS News Hour,'' it had no sponsors
and literally no ratings, he recalls.
   In those days, Mike Wallace and Harry Reasoner were the show's
only correspondents (it has them and three others now). And Andy
Rooney was 10 years away from furrowing his bushy eyebrows near the
end of each week's show and asking viewers, ``Didja ever wonder
about . . .?''
   Hewitt's brainchild's was shifted to Sundays in 1972, and has
been a Sabbath staple since, save for a summer run on Fridays in
1973. It didn't lack viewers when it began, even though it lacked
ratings.
   It just wasn't counted by Nielsen, Hewitt said, because CBS
authorities wouldn't sell advertising time on it and ordered it
aired as ``sustaining,'' or without sponsors. Such shows aren't
rated.
   As one executive explained things to him, Hewitt said, CBS brass
didn't want the low ratings they expected for the new show and the
``News Hour'' to pull down the prime-time average of the network's
entertainment shows.
   He forgets the executive's name but recalls him saying, ``I
don't even want to let a sponsor buy them . . . no matter what
money we make from them, it ain't worth pulling down the average
for CBS.''
   Times have changed a bit since then. The networks once commanded
a 90 percent share of the nation's prime time audience.
   Now, with more than 20 percent of that audience gone elsewhere,
they're scrapping for every cent and viewer they can get, facing
such viewing and advertising alternatives as cable, independent
stations and videocassettes.
   They're trying to look different, with shows like ABC's ``Cop
Rock'' and ``Twin Peaks,'' and letting the language get a little
rowdier, as on CBS' ``Uncle Buck.''
   But ``60 Minutes,'' the nation's highest-rated prime time series
in the 1979-80 season, when network TV was at its peak, still
retains its basic format despite some notable, if occasional,
personnel changes.
   (The most notable was last year's departure of correspondent
Diane Sawyer to jovially bicker with Sam Donaldson on ABC's
``PrimeTime Live'' and see if she could get by on a reported $1.6
million annual stipend.)
   The basic format consists of investigative stories, personality
profiles and the occasional light piece, such as Morley Safer's
report this Sunday on Parisian art galleries where one can buy
``genuine fake art.''
   But the format may be undergoing a slight change.
   When the Persian Gulf crisis was ignited by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, the series began airing late-breaking reports
on the crisis, including one by CBS anchorman Dan Rather, once a
``60 Minutes'' regular.
   Last Sunday, it also had a profile of Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces sent to the Middle East. That
story was done by an outsider of sorts _ David Martin, CBS'
respected Pentagon reporter.
   ``60 Minutes'' seldom has started with the day's hot news,
because ``there was a newcast on Sunday ahead of us and that was
enough,'' Hewitt said.
   But ``we never had something like this'' _ the Gulf crisis and
its continued uncertainties _ ``to contend with before,'' he said.
   So now, he said, ``I think what we'll probably do more often
than not is to run some headlines at the top of the show,'' giving
the latest Gulf crisis news and other reports in brief.
   Will the headlines become a regular part of the show?
   ``I don't know,'' Hewitt said. ``Whenever it warrants it. If
there's enough news that people want to know about it.''
   The dapper, ebullient producer, who turns 68 in December and
says he has an ``unbreakable contract'' to run the show until he's
74, was asked the Annual Question.
   Did he expect ``60 Minutes'' to run this long?
   ``I didn't expect it to run 23 weeks, let alone 23 years,'' he
said.

   POSSIBLE LATE-NIGHT WORD FOR CBS NEWS: CBS News President Eric
Ober, who with his bosses have been discussing what could prove a
late-night rival to ABC's ``Nightline,'' says he might get what he
calls ``the go, no-go'' decision next month.
   CBS has been airing late-night news specials, co-anchored by
Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl, on the Persian Gulf crisis. But
each one still is approved only on a day-to-day basis, Ober says.

<HEAD>Funds Set Global Course For the 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they try to avail themselves of the best
growth opportunities for the 1990s, many mutual-fund investors
pride themselves on taking an international approach.
   That's probably a smart idea, many financial advisers agree. But
they add that global funds may be an even more promising choice
than their international counterparts.
   What's the difference between the two? In the terminology of the
mutual fund business, ``international'' commonly describes a
portfolio made up of securities from outside the United States.
   In a global fund, by contrast, managers mix together both
American and foreign investments.
   Professional investors these days have a strong incentive to
operate with a global approach, since both stocks and
interest-bearing securities of many national origins now trade in
what is fast becoming a continuous 'round-the-world marketplace.
   The profits of American businesses and the levels of U.S.
interest rates are increasingly determined by events and trends
that take place overseas.
   Many observers now argue that growth rates may be greater over
the next several years in Europe, for example, than they are in
this country.
   ``The lure of global investing is a hot fund theme in 1990,''
notes the United Mutual Fund Selector, an investment advisory
service.
   ``Given the trends of the '80s, the odds favor an increasingly
unified world marketplace in the '90s. Naturally, this bodes well
for mutuals with the ability to capitalize upon business action
wherever it occurs.''
   Despite the current recession fears and oil-price worries
gripping most of the world's stock markets, some analysts see
dramatic opportunities in the years ahead.
   ``Facilitated by satellite telecommunications, money, goods and
services flow around the world with fewer restrictions than ever
before,'' observes Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the monthly letter
The No-Load Fund Investor.
   ``With global markets integrated there will be unprecedented
economies of scale, not only in manufacturing but in research,
materials sourcing and other areas.''
   Global funds have an edge over internationals, some analysts
argue, because the United States stands a good chance of
participating handsomely in the rewards of this growth.
   ``America will fare OK in this new world,'' Jacobs maintains.
``It's a myth that we are in decline.''
   The fund industry has seized on these prospects to create more
than two dozen global funds in recent years, with many more
expected to be added to the ranks.
   In a sampling of them that Jacobs examined, the portion of the
portfolio devoted to U.S. holdings ranged from 14 percent to 61
percent.
   Since the people who run these funds have such differing views
about where to allocate their assets, it is only logical that the
results achieved will vary significantly from one global fund to
another.
   Furthermore, managers of these funds have to cope not only with
questions of timing and security selection, but also with political
risk and currency risk. The greater the number of choices to be
made, the greater the possibility that some individual decisions
won't work out well.
   Also, the experts caution, a global portfolio may not provide
much protection from any sort of economic or financial calamity
that sets in worldwide.
   Concludes the United Mutual Fund Selector: ``Even though a
fund's operation and philosophy are worldwide in scope, several
other factors should be considered before jumping on board. These
factors include the costs to buy shares, the performance record,
expense ratio and quality of holdings.''

<HEAD>Common Christian-Jewish-Moslem Prayer Offered Over Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes, people have sought to use prayer as a partisan
weapon, presuming to enlist God on their side against others. But
that's not the case in prayers readied for wide American use this
weekend about the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Prepared on an interfaith basis _ Christian, Moslem and Jewish _
the prayers seek not God's partiality but his guidance. It's sought
to get people to straighten up themselves.
   ``O God . . . illumine our way, our hearts and our minds in this
hour of darkness,'' reads a Moslem-composed part of the prayers.
``Teach our leaders humility, wisdom and good judgment.''
   The old, narrow tendency to attempt to tie God to a particular
side in human conflicts got one of its most incisive and memorable
put-downs from Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War.
   Disagreeing with appeals for prayers that God side with Union
forces, Lincoln said that wasn't his concern ``for I know the Lord
is always on the side of right.''
   Lincoln added: ``But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I
and the nation should be on the Lord's side.''
   That is the emphasis of three prayers being distributed among
churches, mosques and synagogues across the nation for use this
weekend in regard to the international stand-off with Iraq over its
seizing of Kuwait.
   ``Save us from weak resignation to violence,'' reads a
Christian-composed part of the prayers. ``Teach us that restraint
is the highest expression of power, that thoughtfulness and
tenderness are marks of the strong.''
   The prayers were distributed by the U.S. Interreligious
Committee for Peace in the Middle East through national and
regional religious offices of Christian, Jewish and Moslem bodies
for use Sept. 14-16.
   ``How long, O loving God, will we continue to kill in your
name?'' reads a Jewish part of the prayers. ``How long will we
refuse to register the unalterable fact that all human creatures on
this earth are brothers and sisters?''
   Ronald J. Young of Philadelplhia, executive director of the
interreligious committee, said he was ``encouraged and surprised by
the wide pickup on this intiative'' by organizations of all three
religions.
   ``The prayers are going to be used in congregations all over the
country,'' Young said. ``It bespeaks a mood in this country of hope
that the crisis can be cooled down.
   ``On a deeper level, the common spirit of the prayers
demonstrates the oneness of the God we all profess to serve.''
   One of the three prayers was written by a Christian, one by a
Jew and one by a Moslem, but the prayers are not identified by
religion. Young provided that information in explaining the project.
   ``Help us all to defuse this crisis peacefully before it plunges
us into a whirlpool of sensless suffering, bloodshed and war,''
reads a Moslem-composed portion. ``O God, guide us to your ways,
the ways of righteousness and peace.''
   Accompanying the distribution was a call to prayer that
acknowledges religion sometimes ``appears to contribute to Middle
East conflicts,'' but adds:
   ``We believe the deepest sources in our traditions provide
inspiration and wisdom for resolution of these conflicts.''
   The call was issued by Dawud Assad, president of the Council of
Mosques; the Rev. Bryan Hehir, Roman Catholic international affairs
consultant; the Rev. Dale L. Bishop, head of the Middle East Office
of the National Council of Churches; and Rabbi Arthur Hetzberg,
vice president of the World Jewish Congress.
   ``Help us to love our enemies, not by countenancing their sins,
but by remembering our own,'' goes a Christian-composed portion.
   ``O God, as Moslems, Jews and Christians, we acknowledge that
thou hast made of one blood all the nations of the earth. Thou dost
love all of us, as if all were but one . . . .''
   The sponsoring committee, made up of 1,200 Christian, Moslem and
Jewish members, was formed in 1988 to support an active U.S. role
in encouraging peace between Israel, Palestinians and Arab states.
   ``That remains primary,'' Young said. But the constituency also
felt the need for a joint voice on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Although differences in religion often are blamed for conflicts,
Presbyterian leader William P. Thompson said such troubles are
caused by human deviations from religious principles, not adherence
to them.
   Thompson, associate secretary-general of the World Conference on
Religion and Peace, added, ``The sacred writings of all of the
great religions commit themselves to peace.''
   A Jewish part of the joint prayers over the Gulf crisis goes:
   ``O God . . . Help us to overcome the rationalizations that
ultimately end in justification of actions which inevitably lead to
bloodshed and suffering . . .
   ``Grant us the ability to find joy and strength not in the
strident call to arms, but in stretching out our arms to grasp our
fellow creatures in the striving for justice and truth.''

   Contending they have been excluded from positions
in the Southern Baptist Convention, moderates have organized a
fellowship of their own, but stopped short of forming a new
denomination.
   A three-day consultation of about 3,000 concerned Baptists was
held here two months after fundamentalists in June solidified their
control of the 14.9 million-member denomination.
   The consultation set up a mechanism, called the Baptist
Cooperative Missions Program, to handle contributions apart from
denominational channels, and also elected a 60-member interim
steering committee on future steps.
   ``This is the first time in Baptist history that any group of
folks has been systematically excluded,'' said the Rev. David Sapp
of Chamblee, Ga.
   The Rev. Daniel Vestal of Atlanta, twice defeated moderate
candidate for the convention's presidency and chairman of the new
steering committee, said the aim was renewal, not a new
denomination.
   However, he said, ``It will only be a matter of time until the
character of SBC institutions change so drastically that many
Bapltists will no longer be able to support them in good
conscience.''

   Democrat Theo Mitchell is making scant
headway in his bid to become the nation's second black elected
governor, and some South Carolina Democrats complain the candidate
has done little to help himself.
   Mitchell's campaign also has had to compete for attention with a
statehouse bribery scandal that so far has brought the indictments
of five state legislators.
   ``The only issue anyone wants to talk about is ethics,'' said
Lynn Stokes, a veteran of other Democratic campaigns.
   Democratic activists say Mitchell's campaign suffers from poor
organization and a lack of publicity.
   ``He's making little or no headway,'' said Charles T. ``Bud''
Ferillo, a Democratic consultant.
   Mitchell's campaign ``has not demonstrated any seriousness,''
said Samuel Tenenbaum, a key Democratic fund-raiser who has
contributed $1,000 to the Mitchell camp.
   Mitchell, however, maintains his campaign is in good health.
   ``I am elated at the momentum,'' he said. ``I don't understand
what the commotion is all about.''
   Mitchell, a lawyer and state senator who has spent 16 years in
the General Assembly, is hoping to follow the path of Virginia's
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who last year became the nation's first
elected black governor.
   But with less than 60 days before the Nov. 6 general election,
Mitchell faces long odds in his attempt to defeat first-term
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Earl Black, a professor at the University of South Carolina and
an expert on Southern politics, said a landslide Campbell victory
would devastate Democrats, who have long dominated South Carolina
politics.
   ``No Republican in South Carolina has ever had a send-off like
that,'' Black said.
   Some Democrats say Mitchell has done little to help himself.
   ``If I were running the campaign, I would have press conferences
every week on some issue,'' said Stokes. ``You have to draw a
crowd.''
   Activists say the campaign seems to have no organization beyond
a few people at its Greenville headquarters.
   ``You've got to establish a grassroots campaign. It's a
hackneyed phrase, but it's true,'' said a Democrat who is involved
in another statewide campaign. ``(Mitchell) could be in the Poconos
blue-fishing for all I know.''
   Mike Hart, who manages Mitchell's campaign, bristles at such
talk, insisting that the campaign has the assistance of several top
Democrats, including former Gov. Dick Riley and Charleston Mayor
Joe Riley.
   In addition, Hart said, Mitchell has coordinators in each of the
state's 46 counties. The campaign also has three top coordinators.
   ``We have a massive undertaking going on,'' Hart said.
   Ms. Stokes and several other Democrats said it may be impossible
for Campbell to get reporters to focus on any story that does not
relate to the bribery scandal, in which three state lawmakers have
pleaded guilty.
   Democratic state Rep. David Beasley, imposing his own grading
system on a potential Mitchell press conference, said the bribery
scandal takes ``what initially would be a `B' story, and it makes
it a `D' story.''
   Det Bowers, who is managing Democratic Lt. Gov. Nick Theodore's
re-election bid, said Mitchell must make stronger efforts to get
attention in the midst of the scandal.
   ``Any challenger has to be innovative and creative. And you've
got to be more creative to slice through that,'' Bowers said.
   Mitchell said he does not want to publicize all campaign
appearances for safety reasons. He also said some reporters are
biased in favor of Campbell and refuse to give him attention.
   ``Some reporters have written condescendingly about the
campaign,'' he said.
   Mitchell has several times questioned the racial motivation
behind the federal bribery investigation, and those accusations
have received some press attention.
   Only one of the five indicted lawmakers is black. But six more
present and former legislators last week were identified as
conspirators in the scandal, five of whom are black. A black
circuit judge, who is currently suspended, was also named. None of
the seven has been charged.
   Mitchell has said he turned down a lobbyist's offer of a
campaign contribution in exchange for a vote on a betting bill and
believes he was targeted in the FBI sting because he is running for
governor.
   ``Certainly it's a disproportionate number of black legislators
that were targeted,'' he said last month.
   Republicans say the main problem with Mitchell's gubernatorial
bid is that he is too liberal for the state's voters. State GOP
Chairman Barry Wynn said Mitchell is ``out of touch with what we
think is mainstream South Carolina.''
   Mitchell, meanwhile, describes himself as a supporter of
``fundamental, mainstream values'' and the ``God-given rights'' of
all people, including workers, women and homosexuals.
   He accuses Campbell of ``trying to take political advantage'' of
the bribery scandal in proposing ethics reforms. He also says the
governor has ``catered to the wealthy and privileged'' at the
expense of poor, elderly and working-class people.
   With the traditional Labor Day campaign kickoff now past,
Democrats say Mitchell must begin moving earnestly very soon.
   ``If you aren't within close striking distance about 30 days
before the election, it's very difficult to win,'' Bowers said.
``By Oct. 1, you've got to be within several points.''

   What scares Pam Dawber more, doing her own
stunt work on the side of a high-rise building or returning to a
situation comedy?
   She conquered the challenge of rappelling down the side of a
40-story building for the CBS movie ``The Face of Fear,'' to be
shown Sunday. But the memory of the murder of a co-star in the
series ``My Sister Sam'' holds a lingering dread as she prepares
for a new CBS sitcom.
   Recalling the slaying of Rebecca Schaeffer, who played Miss
Dawber's teen-age sister in ``My Sister Sam,'' the actress says she
worries the new series will ``bring the crazies out of the
woodwork.''
   ``Suddenly, it will start again,'' she said. ``The threats, the
letters. I'm more sensitive to it because of what happened to
Rebecca.''
   Miss Schaeffer, 21, was shot to death July 18, 1989, by a man
who was waiting outside her West Hollywood apartment. Robert John
Bardo, 19, of Tucson, Ariz., described by police as an obsessed fan
of Miss Schaeffer, goes to trial Oct. 15 for first-degree murder.
   That tragedy still in her mind, Miss Dawber faced new emotions
during her work on ``The Face of Fear.''
   She first thought the movie would be easy _ because a lot of the
action seemed to involve stunt doubles escaping down the outside of
a 40-story building.
   ``When I read the script I thought this isn't going to be bad.
There's going to be so much stunt work that I won't be working that
much.'' She laughed. ``We ended up doing most of our own stunts.''
   During the filming, Miss Dawber and co-star Lee Horsley were
suspended by ropes on the outside of a building. They were never
more than six stories high, but still high enough to give you a
case of acrophobia.
   ``I think they originally thought most of the work would be done
by stunt people. But in teaching us to rappel, Kenny Bates, our
stunt coordinator, found Lee and I are both comfortable with
heights,'' she said. ``And both of us enjoyed it as we learned how
to do it. He (Bates) said, `Look, this will look much better if you
two do most of your own stunts.'
   ``So we tried it . . . We had to climb out the window and hang
off a ledge. We truly rappelled down into space. That was the thing
that unnerved me. Even in the studio on a set we were still three
stories high. It frightened me enough to stop and ask: ``What am I
doing?' ''
   Doing a thriller movie in the role of a police forensic
psychologist is a change of pace for Miss Dawber, until now noted
for situation comedies, including ``Mork &amp; Mindy.''
   ``The reason I found the role attractive is the roles I get, the
roles I'm offered, I'm usually the nice girl or the mom,'' she
said. ``This is a (assertive) woman . . . She really forces the
story along.''
   In ``The Face of Fear,'' Horsley is a mountain climber who
suffers a devastating fall that leaves him afraid of heights. A
more unsettling side effect is that he's developed psychic
abilities. With the help of Miss Dawber and the police, he is about
to identify a serial killer.
   The killer wants to silence Horsley and traps him _ and Miss
Dawber _ at the top of the high-rise building. The only escape is
down the outside, where Miss Dawber helps Horsley overcome his fear
of heights.
   Farhad Mann directed from a script by Dean R. Koontz and Alan
Jay Glueckman, based on the novel by Koontz.
   Miss Dawber was not happy the long shooting schedule kept her
away from Sean, her 2-year-old son with her husband, actor Mark
Harmon.
   ``There were times when I'd leave home before Sean woke up, and
I'd come home and he'd be asleep,'' she said. ``It's just not the
way I want to live my life.''
   The actress said she will be more selective in her projects so
she isn't separated as much from her child.
   Despite the crushing memory of how ``My Sister Sam'' ended, Miss
Dawber thinks a half-hour comedy series offers the best working
conditions to combine work and family. She isn't talking about her
new series until the network approves the concept. Like her other
sitcoms, it will be a four-camera show filmed before a live
audience.
   ``I'd like for it to be a little more adult than what I've done
before,'' she said. ``I think it's a nine o'clock show. It depends
on whether they like it. But I'd rather see it a little more
sophisticated.
   ``It's so hard to describe a situation comedy. It's all about
casting, it's all about the characters, it's all about the jokes
and stories. I can just imagine that in the original pitch meeting
for `Cheers' it didn't sound very exciting: `There's this bar, and
people never leave it.' ''

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Dianne Feinstein and
Republican Pete Wilson are battling for the minds of
middle-of-the-road voters in the California governor's race.
   Both stress issues on which they differ with most activists in
their own party.
   Feinstein's latest television commercial features shots of her
being booed loudly by delegates to the California Democratic Party
Convention last April for stating her support of the death penalty.
   That stand was one of the principal reasons the former San
Francisco mayor lost the state party endorsement in the primary,
but it put her in step with the majority of California voters.
   She also has endorsed an inmate labor program sponsored by
retiring Republican Gov. George Deukmejian that is adamantly
opposed by her organized labor supporters.
   Similarly, Wilson, a two-term U.S. senator and former San Diego
mayor, refuses to rule out raising taxes, as conservatives in his
party wish.
   ``Am I taking a no-new-taxes pledge?'' Wilson asked one
conservative audience. ``No. I can't do that. I can't responsibly
tell you never. I can tell you that raising taxes to fund
government programs will not be my first choice, as it has been
that of Mrs. Feinstein. It will be my grudging last resort.''
   The Feinstein-Wilson race is a top national priority with both
parties. California will gain seven new seats in Congress in the
1991 reapportionment, increasing the state delegation to 52 seats.
   The only chance Republicans have to prevent a gerrymander by the
Democrat-controlled Legislature is the threat of a GOP governor's
veto. The difference between a compromise negotiated between a GOP
governor and Democratic Legislature and a reapportionment
controlled entirely by Democrats could be eight to 10 House seats.
   Spending in the governor's race may exceed $25 million and the
candidates have been running dead even.
   So far, Wilson has failed to capitalize on his enormous
fund-raising advantage. And Feinstein has been unable to sustain
the excitement her candidacy sparked when she became the first
woman to win a major party nomination for governor of California.
   Smear commercials marked the summer phase of the campaign.
   A Feinstein commercial cited $243,000 in campaign contributions
Wilson received in the past decade from savings and loan executives.
   ``California can't afford a politician like Pete Wilson as
governor,'' Feinstein's commercial concludes.
   Wilson accused Feinstein of hypocrisy, saying she and her
husband ``own'' a savings and loan which received federal bailout
funds. Feinstein's husband has a minority interest in an Oregon
savings and loan.
   ``He's lying about me,'' Feinstein replied.
   Wilson and Feinstein are well-suited for a battle for the
independent, undecided and middle-of-the-road voters.
   Wilson has a stronger environmental record than most
Republicans, supporting growth management and coastal zoning
restrictions and opposing offshore oil drilling.
   Feinstein has stronger ties than most Democrats to business
leaders, in part through her husband, multimillionaire investment
banker Richard Blum.
   Wilson and Feinstein, who both celebrated their 57th birthdays
in recent weeks, have had roughly parallel careers as big city
mayors. Wilson served 11 years as mayor of San Diego before his
election to the U.S. Senate in 1982, and Feinstein served nine
years as mayor of San Francisco.
   As mayors, both stressed consensus and compromise and collected
vocal critics on both the left and right. But both won repeat terms
by landslide margins.
   There is a maked difference in style between the two contenders.
There is a star quality about Feinstein, who is often described as
charismatic. Wilson, with bland good looks and a plodding speaking
style, is the very antithesis of charisma.
   Feinstein's political career is defined principally by one
dramatic event, when she was thrust into the mayor's office by the
assassination of then-Mayor George Moscone and brought what was
then a troubled city together.
   Wilson's political career is one of methodical, low-profile
consensus building.
   But while Feinstein's charisma creates excitement, especially
among women voters, pollster Mervin Field says it also is her
biggest negative. Voters report a higher comfort level with Wilson.
   Field said distrust of Feinstein is the No. 1 reason Wilson
voters cite for supporting the Republican. Field also said the
gender gap in Feinstein's favor among women voters is almost
exactly matched by a similar gap in men's preference for Wilson.

   Every Wednesday, the Democrats who represent
Texas in Congress eat lunch in the private dining room of the
Speaker of the House.
   The entree, like the politicking and gossiping, varies each
week. But cornbread and ice cream are always served.
   They were the favorite foods of Sam Rayburn, the Bonham farmer
and teacher who began a record 17-year tenure as House Speaker 50
years ago Sunday.
   Tough and gritty, warm and loyal, Rayburn was a statesman in
Washington and friend in the 4th District of Texas. After he
presided over the 1952 Democratic Convention, the first to be
televised, he became known to millions of Americans as ``Mr.
Democrat.'' To friends and colleagues, he was ``Mr. Sam.''
   ``He was the greatest man I ever served with in Congress,'' said
former Speaker Carl Albert, whose Oklahoma district was just across
the Red River from Rayburn's. ``He had wisdom. He had courage. He
had judgment.''
   ``I don't think we'll ever see his like again,'' said H.G.
Dulaney, one of only 38 staff workers Rayburn hired during his 48
years in Congress. Dulaney, who went to work for Rayburn in 1951,
has been in charge of the Sam Rayburn Library in Bonham since 1957.
The library is dedicating a new statue and plaza to celebrate the
Rayburn anniversary.
   Rayburn had enormous power as Speaker and few Democrats would
break ranks with him on a vote. At his strongest, Rayburn told
members of the House Appropriations Committee not to question $2
billion being secretly spent in 1944. Only he and a handful of
others knew it was to develop an atomic bomb.
   ``There really hasn't been a Speaker even approaching Rayburn's
power since him,'' said Donald Bacon, a Washington journalist who
in 1987 completed a biography that Rayburn associate D.B. Hardeman
started 30 years earlier.
   ``Part of that is because of changes in the way Congress
operates,'' Bacon said. And part, he said, was because in Rayburn's
waning days, ``members came to Congress who were better educated,
more independent-minded and less willing to accept strong direction
from within the House hierarchy.''
   Rayburn died of cancer in 1961 at age 79, but there are
reminders of him all over Washington. Portraits and statues of him
dot Capitol Hill. President Lyndon Johnson, his protege, dedicated
the mammoth Rayburn House Office Building in 1965.
   And the Texas lone star is still emblazoned near the ceiling of
the room in the Capitol where Rayburn hosted the so-called ``Board
of Education.'' Rayburn invited colleagues to H-128 after each
day's legislating to drink, gossip and trade information.
   Harry Truman was in the room on April 12, 1945, when he was
summoned to the White House upon the death of Franklin D.
Roosevelt. ``Jesus Christ and General Jackson,'' the new president
said as he left.
   Rayburn in the 1920s was a regular in a similar ``Bureau of
Education'' hosted by John Nance Garner, the Democratic leader from
south Texas who later became vice president, and Nicholas
Longworth, the Ohio Republican who was House Speaker.
   The nation was struggling out of the Depression and World War II
was looming when Speaker William B. Bankhead of Alabama died of a
stomach hemorrhage Sept. 15, 1940.
   Rayburn was sworn in the next day _ only the second man in the
history of the House to be elected its leader without opposition.
His service as Speaker was twice interrupted when Republicans held
the majority of House seats in 1946-48 and 1952-54.
   He had arrived in Congress in 1913 after working his way through
East Texas Normal College and serving in the Texas House, where in
1911 he was elected Speaker.
   A student of Garner's and Bailey's, Rayburn would become the
House architect of New Deal legislation, Johnson's patron and the
physical embodiment of the Congress to millions.
   ``Rayburn understood people and he knew how to make people work
for him and to work with each other,'' Bacon said.
   ``He was a legislator. He passed laws. But the content of those
laws concerned him less than getting them passed,'' Bacon said.
``Today, a leader has to be concerned both with content and
legislative procedure.''
   In later years, Rayburn boosted the young congressional careers
of Texans Lloyd Bentsen, Jack Brooks and Jim Wright.
   ``His was an art of gentle persuasion. He believed very strongly
in a man's commitment and his word,'' Bentsen said.
   Congressional sessions were shorter and less demanding 50 years
ago and Rayburn spent the long recesses on his farm in Bonham, 45
miles north of Dallas. His only marriage failed after a few weeks,
but he was devoted to his large family of brothers and sisters,
nieces and nephews.
   His rural background and patient belief that most problems
worked themselves out over time added to Rayburn's stature in
Congress, Bacon said.
   ``When Rayburn was coming up in the 20s, 30s and 40s, we still
thought of ourselves as a relatively simple people with little
ambition beyond our own shores,'' Bacon said in an interview. ``He
certainly represented what we like to think is an American attitude
and spirit of good will and honesty.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar remained lower against the Japanese yen
during morning trading Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange rose moderately.
   The dollar was changing hands at 139.05 yen at late morning,
down 0.80 yen from Tuesday's close. It opened at 139.30 yen and
ranged between 138.90 yen and 139.35 yen.
   It was the dollar's lowest opening since Oct. 2, 1989 when the
currency opened at 138.77 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 87.92
points, or 0.35 percent, closing the morning session at 24,692.58.
The index shed 476.24 points on Tuesday.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond edged higher to 8.375 percent, from
Wednesday's close of 8.360 percent. The price stood at 81.97
points, down from 82.03.
   Currency dealers said the yen was stronger against the dollar,
with action focusing on cross-trading in which traders bought the
yen against major European currencies.
   Traders said there was little noticeable reaction in the market
to President Bush's speech Tuesday night before Congress. In the
address, Bush urged Congress to finish work on a budget agreement
``to get America's fiscal house in order'' before the nation's new
fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said investors are trying to reduce their dollar holding
positions because of an increasing pessimism over the U.S. economy.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started lower with the
market taking a wait-and-see position over higher interest rates,
but buying on incentive-backed issues reversed the early trend,
dealers said.
   ``In particular, incentive-backed issues were bought because of
reasonable prices'' following declines the previous day, said a
dealer with New Japan Securities Co. who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. have won an extension until Feb. 28 of their exclusive
right to file a plan for emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization.
   But creditors and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., who
granted the permission Tuesday, said they will watch closely to
ensure that Federated and Allied do not ease efforts to get out of
reorganization.
   The Chapter 11 proceedings give the companies the bankruptcy
court's protection from creditors.
   ``I recognize that this extension is a long one,'' Aug told
lawyers for Federated and Allied and their creditors. ``This
extension isn't a sign to ease up.''
   Federated and Allied told the judge they were not ready and need
to concentrate on the upcoming Christmas retailing season.
   Without the exclusivity privilege, the companies' creditors
would have the right to file their own proposed reorganization
plans for the judge to consider.
   It is the second extension Aug has granted the Cincinnati-based
companies, which together operate 251 stores in 27 states and
employ about 100,000 people. The companies originally had until May
13 to file the reorganization plan. The deadline would have been
today if Aug had not granted Tuesday's extension.
   Aug told creditors' lawyers Tuesday that if he sees lack of
progress, he would reconsider whether Federated and Allied should
have exclusive rights to file the reorganization plan.
   Creditors complained they know little of the retailers'
progress. Federated and Allied had promised to file by last month
their projections of long-term business prospects, but the report
now is not expected until early October.
   Aug directed lawyers for Federated and Allied to give him status
reports every 60 days on the reorganization efforts.
   ``No one, more than this management, wants to get out of Chapter
11,'' company lawyer David Heiman told the judge. ``The management
has worked very hard for eight months to establish a foundation for
emerging from reorganization.''
   Federated and Allied filed Chapter 11 petitions Jan. 15 listing
$7.7 billion in debts, much of it inherited from Toronto-based
Campeau Corp.'s heavy borrowing for its leveraged buyouts of Allied
in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   Aug is to hear arguments Sept. 27 on whether a committee of
Allied bondholders should be allowed to proceed with a threatened
lawsuit. The committee said the prospective defendants include
Campeau Corp., its American retailing subsidiary Federated Stores
Inc., former Allied officers and directors and banks including Bank
of Montreal, Banque Paribas and Citibank.
   The bondholders contend that up to $1 billion in proceeds from
Allied's 1989 sale of the Ann Taylor store division and 1988 sale
of Brooks Brothers was fraudulently conveyed from Allied to buy
worthless stock or to pay off bank debt.
   The bondholders allege that the transactions stripped assets
from Allied to the detriment of its investors.
   The committee has notified Federated and Allied of intention to
file the lawsuit. The companies responded by asking Aug not to
allow the lawsuit to go forward. Federated and Allied said the
issue should be negotiated and that a lawsuit could delay progress
of the companies' reorganization.
   Ellen Werther, a lawyer for the bondholders' committee, told Aug
Tuesday that the committee is ready to negotiate, but believes it
should have the option of filing suit in order to resolve the
dispute.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Rises 3.7 Percent in August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus edged up 3.7 percent in
August to $3.49 billion from $3.37 billion a year earlier, the
Finance Ministry announced Wednesday.
   It was the third time this year that the nation's trade gap has
widened compared with a year earlier. The surplus had declined for
11 consecutive months until March.
   Ministry officials attributed the widening of the trade gap to
increased exports, but said they expect the surplus to trend lower,
at least in part because strong Japanese domestic demand has
spurred imports of a variety of products, including manufactured
goods.
   Domestic demand, corporate investment in plant and equipment,
and personal consumption have helped fuel 46 straight months of
economic growth in Japan.
   Exports climbed 2.6 percent in August to $22.39 billion from a
year earlier, while imports rose 2.4 percent to $18.90 billion, the
ministry said.
   Ministry officials noted that the surplus in August shrank 35.3
percent from the previous month, when it totaled $5.39 billion.
   On a regional basis, the trade surplus with the United States,
Japan's largest single trading partner, shrank 6 percent to $2.83
billion as exports fell 3.2 percent while imports fell 1.3 percent.
   A ministry official attributed the decline to the slowdown of
the U.S. economy.
   Japan's surplus with the 12-nation European Community dropped
16.2 percent to $1.13 billion, while the surplus with Asia soared
75.3 percent to $1.57 billion.
   Ministry officials said the impact of the Middle East crisis
began affecting Japan's trade with Iraq and Kuwait during the month.
   Japan's exports to Iraq plunged 78.3 percent from a year earlier
to $9.11 million while imports from that country, mostly crude oil,
dropped 30.6 percent to $81.86 million.
   Exports to Kuwait fell 86.6 percent while imports from Kuwait
were down 32.3 percent. Kuwait was invaded by Iraq on Aug. 2.
   ``There is no doubt that the impact of the Middle East crisis
has started making itself felt,'' said the ministry official, who
briefed reporters on the trade statistics.
   He said the Middle East conflict didn't affect the price of oil
in August as far as trade statistics were concerned because oil
prices averaged $16.33 a barrel in the month, down from $17.19 a
year earlier.
   From September on, however, rising oil prices will hit Japan,
boosting its import bills, he said.
   The ministry used an average exchange rate of 148.89 yen in
calculating exports and 148.90 yen for imports.
   Japan calculates its trade figures on a customs-clearance basis,
in which freight and insurance charges are included in imports but
not in exports.

   Apparel manufacturer Leslie Fay Cos. has cast
off the frumpy, old-fashioned image that clung to its skirts for
decades. In the process, it has reinvented the market for
moderately priced women's apparel _ a segment that retailers had
been taking for granted.
   Customers shopping for $100 dresses had not been courted
actively by store operators who preferred to exert their
promotional muscle on more glamorous and pricey apparel yielding
fatter profit margins.
   Trendy upscale fashions and eye-catching designer collections
traditionally have been deemed better lures for shoppers. Even if
expensive duds don't actually hook customers, retailers reasoned,
they yank people in the door.
   In some stores, price-conscious customers had been virtually
ignored, left to rummage through crowded racks of rumpled clothing.
   About three years ago, John J. Pomerantz, chairman and chief
executive officer of the company his father founded in the 1940s,
set out to persuade his department store clients they were making a
mistake.
   Necessity spawned the strategy. Leslie Fay enjoyed good growth
during the 1980s. But the sales gains were misleading because they
reflected an explosion in new stores.
   ``We thought we were doing great . . . but we didn't have a real
plan when all of a sudden the stores stopped building,'' Pomerantz
admitted.
   When the retail building boom died out, retailers looking for
ways to maximize profits latched on to the idea of selling
merchandise under their own names to reap higher returns. They also
tried to elevate their stores so they could sell a greater
proportion of costlier goods.
   ``We were doubly attacked. We were attacked by the private label
and we were attacked by the upgrading, getting into higher fashions
and more sophisticated garments,'' Pomerantz recalled.
   Apparently, Pomerantz has convinced many retailers that it pays
to pay attention to what budget-minded shoppers want. It helped
that retailers' love affair with private labels turned sour;
shoppers showed they preferred national brands. Also, cash-strapped
stores decided it was too costly to emphasize in-house lines.
   Pomerantz and his colleagues found from contacting consumers
directly that the way stores displayed Leslie Fay dresses and suits
devalued the label. Wearers of Leslie Fay clothing liked its
quality but felt it was fuddy-duddy.
   One of the results of this corporate soul-searching was the
development of in-store boutiques, a grander version of the special
sections set aside in department stores for single, typically more
expensive, brands.
   ``All of our clothes were just in a sea of merchandise. So we
decided we had to differentiate ourselves,'' Pomerantz explained in
an interview at Leslie Fay's New York headquarters. ``The whole
idea of the boutique means the merchandise is presented the way you
feel it should be presented.''
   It took a lot of persuasion to get retailers to foot the bill
for the boutiques and at first many balked. Maas Brothers in
Florida was the first to try the concept, which took off. Now there
are hundreds of Leslie Fay boutiques within department stores,
mainly away from big cities.
   In transforming Leslie Fay into a ``super brand,'' the company
consolidated its moderate lines under the Leslie Fay name and
licensed the name for use on shoes and other items.
   It tapped new designing talent to update styles to appeal to a
younger set and embarked on its most ambitious advertising campaign
ever. The Aug. 26 New York Times Magazine carried a splashy ad
touting ``Leslie Fay Women,'' a pitch refinement that has helped
enhance the image of a line long associated with staid matrons.
   Having achieved much of what he set out to accomplish in the
mid-level apparel range, Pomerantz has set his sights on bolstering
the company's clout in the better, bridge and designer parts of the
business.
   Moderate dresses and suits, the point at which prices start in
department stores, range from $80 to $120. The ``better'' category
runs from $125 to $190; ``bridge'' is around $250 to $275; and the
designer category generally is above that.
   The plan to move up market will bring Leslie Fay far from its
roots. When Fred Pomerantz started the company in the mid-1940s, he
applied what he had learned about fit and sizing from making World
War II uniforms. The company, named for his daughter, pioneered the
``petite'' catgegory.
   Leslie Fay has changed through acquisition and internal growth.
Its name has stayed the same, although its namesake has virtually
nothing to do with the company and devotes her time to charity
work. Its divisions include various specialized segments, from the
flagship Leslie Fay labels to the tony Albert Nipon designer
collection to HEAD sportswear.
   Denizens of New York's garment district look on Leslie Fay as
one of the industry's grand dames while securities analysts rate
the company favorably.
   ``As is in the retail industry, the men are being separated from
the boys. The strong are getting stronger and the weak are dropping
by the wayside. I'd put Leslie Fay in the strong category,'' said
Edward F. Johnson, of Prescott Ball &amp; Turben.
   The company's finances are on an even enough keel to withstand a
spending slowdown, according to Johnson. ``They won't be immune to
a pullback by the consumer but they should do better than others,''
he said.
   Testament to its financial well-being was that Leslie Fay
managed to survive two leveraged buyouts in the 1980s.
   The first was for $58 million in 1982 and the second, for $168
million, bought out investors in the first LBO. Leslie Fay went
public again in 1986 at $18 a share, a level the stock hasn't
achieved since. It recently has traded at around $10.50 a share.
   Sales and profits have grown steadily. The growth came despite
upheaval in retailing, instigated largely by the Campeau
Corp.-owned Federated and Allied department store chains, which
filed for bankruptcy in January 1990.
   Leslie Fay's earnings grew 15.8 percent last year to $25.76
million on a 15.2 percent sales gain to $786.3 million. Through the
first half of this year, sales rose 8.6 percent to $389.2 million,
while income was running 8.8 percent above last year, at $10.75
million. Pomerantz predicts sales will exceed $880 million this
year and the profit will reach a record level.
   The years of repositioning have brought successes but Pomerantz
isn't satisfied, saying the company has further to go in carrying
out its plans.
   ``We're not even there yet,'' he said.
   As for where ``there'' is, Pomerantz has a clear _ if ambitious
_ idea.
   ``I think what we want to do is be the best apparel maker in
America with the ability to create apparel for every woman in the
country no matter what her pocketbook is, no matter what her
physical size might be.''

   The stock market showed a small gain today in
another quiet session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 5.45 to
2,618.07 in the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with

   Analysts said traders appeared to respond positively to the
tough line taken by President Bush in his televised comments
Tuesday night on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush seemed to commit the United States to whatever measures
might be necessary to thwart Iraq's effort to annex Kuwait.
   However, investors were evidently in no rush to bid up stocks
until they could see more evidence of the likely future course of
the economy.
   The monthly report due out Friday on the producer price index of
finished goods is expected to show some of the unsettling effects
of the surge in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion on Aug. 2.

<HEAD>Ames Announces $152.5 Million Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc. on
Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of $152.5 million, but
store officials said the loss before non-recurring charges was
significantly smaller than expected.
   The loss for the discount store chain, which filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in April,
was $4.15 per share. The store lost $11.1 million, or 38 cents a
share, in 1989's second quarter.
   Ames said this year's second-quarter loss reflected $73.1
million in non-recurring charges, including adjustment in amounts
of accounts payable during the bankruptcy claims filing process, a
reserve for inventory markdowns, and a writedown of certain
management information systems installed as part of the Zayres
store consolidation.
   ``The $79.4 million loss before non-recurring charges, was
significantly less than we had anticipated because of
better-than-expected summer clearance sales,'' said Stephen L.
Pistner, Ames' chief executive officer.
   Ames reported total sales for the quarter of $563.3 million, a
33 percent decline from last year's adjusted total. The 1989
adjusted sales, excluding sales from 221 stores closed during this
year's second quarter, totalled $852 million.
   Pistner said the store started the second quarter in a poor
in-stock position on seasonal merchandise and had suspended
circular advertising. The store resumed sending weekly circulars on
July 29 because of dramatically improved stock positions and vendor
shipments, Pistner said.
   ``We essentially restarted the business during the quarter,'' he
said. ``Our most important priorities were to restore the flow of
merchandise to our stores and to resume the advertising program. We
restored both.''

<HEAD>Northwest Seeks Australian Route</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has applied to the U.S.
Transportation Department for special authority to enter the
well-traveled Australian market.
   The application filed Tuesday was made in the form of an
``emergency exemption.'' It says the route should be reopened to
applicants because it understood Hawaiian Airlines is preparing to
abandon its Australian service. Northwest said Hawaiian is not
booking flights to Sydney after Sept. 21.
   The Northwest application did not specify flight frequencies,
schedules or airplane types that it would operate. While the
airline would prefer to fly nonstop between Los Angeles and Sydney,
Northwest spokesman Robert Gibbons said it also would be interested
in service out of Honolulu.
   Australia is the only major market in the Pacific region that
Northwest does not serve. In addition to Hawaiian Airlines, United,
Continental and American airlines have flights to and from
Australia.
   American received its route authority last year from the
Transportation Department. Northwest, which had proposed nonstop
service between Los Angeles and Sydney, lost out when an
administrative law judge for the Transportation Department
concluded that Northwest already had a substantial presence in the
Pacific region and that for competitive reasons the available
Australian route should go to American.
   ``It's a good market, particularly as a leisure market,'' said
Northwest's Gibbons. ``We didn't feel we should be excluded from an
entire continent because we were big in Japan. Those are two
entirely separate markets.''
   Meanwhile, Northwest Chairman Al Checchi met Tuesday with
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner. But neither the
Transportation Department nor Northwest would comment on the talks.

   Oil futures prices were lower at midday today in
the wake of a report showing the U.S. supply of crude was up.
   After the market had closed on Tuesday, the American Petroleum
Institute issued its weekly report which said supplies of crude
oil, heating oil and gasoline were all higher.
   In late morning trading today on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, light sweet crude had fallen 41 cents to $30.35 per
barrel for October delivery.
   Unleaded gasoline fell .20 cent to 93.40 cents per gallon on
October contracts, while home heating oil fell 1.43 cents to 81.60
cents per gallon on October contracts.
   Contracts for later months were mixed on the petroleum futures,
but most of them were lower.
   The October contract for natural gas was up to $1.535 per 1,000
cubic feet, compared with Tuesday's close of $1.525.
   The oil futures market moved higher at the outset of trading
today, reflecting passimism about a quick end to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``The market opened up a little bit because of the story that
the Iranian religious leader said that those opposed the U.S.
presence in the gulf would be fighting a holy war,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today said that Moslems who die while
fighting the U.S. in the Persian Gulf would go to heaven as
martyrs. His comments came two days after Iran and Iraq restored
diplomatic ties for the first time since their extended war of the
1980s.
   ``The market reacted quite nervously to that in London,'' Hittle
said. ``The New York market market opened up, but then it came
down, I think maybe because of the API statistics.''
   The API reported distillate stockpiles rose from 126.7 million
barrels to 131.7 million barrels for the week ending Sept. 7, while
distillate production and imports were down. The stockpile of
distillates, which include heating oil, had been 119.8 million
barrels a year earlier, API said.
   Crude oil imports were up to 6.9 million barrels per day from
6.8 million barrels per day for the week, while crude stockpiles
were up to 374.3 million barrels, from 372.2 million barrels. A
year earlier, crude imports had been running at 6.5 million barrels
per day, while the stockpile had been 338.6 million barrels.
   Gasoline stocks stood at 211.1 million barrels, up from 210.5
million barrels a week earlier but down from 218.4 million barrels
a year earlier. Gasoline imports were at 261,000 barrels per day,
up from 192,000 barrels per day a week earlier but down from
272,000 barrels per day a year earlier.
   Meanwhile, gasoline prices at the pump were also up, according
to the latest figures from the American Automobile Association.
   AAA reported late Tuesday that a gallon of self-serve regular
unleaded rose 2.1 cents to $1.294 per gallon nationwide since last
Wednesday. The average retail price was 21.9 cents higher than Aug.
1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait and sent oil markets into a
state of chaos.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as
players took profits, then took to the sidelines to await this
afternoon's monthly government crop report.
   The Agriculture Department report, due out after the close of
trading, was expected to contain a significantly larger corn crop
estimate than last month but little change in the soybean harvest
projection.
   A survey of 32 grain analysts yielded an average corn crop
estimate of 7.97 billion bushels compared with last month's USDA
projection of 7.85 billion.
   The analysts' soybean crop projections averaged out to 1.84
billion bushels, unchanged from the government's August estimate.
   John Frazier, director of agricultural commodities trading with
Gerald Inc., said the early decline in prices also reflected
disappointment that President Bush made no mention in his speech to
Congress Tuesday of offering food export credits to the Soviet
Union.
   Frazier said trading volume was ``extremely dull.
   ``We expected it to be dull anyway because this is report day,
but this is ridiculous,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent lower
with the contract for delivery in September offered at $2.67{ a
bushel and the December contract at $2.83{; corn was } cent to 1{
cents lower with September at $2.40} a bushel; oats were \ cent to
{ cent lower with September bid at $1.11{ a bushel and December at
$1.20}; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
September at $6.24{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .32 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October
at 78.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent
lower with September at 87.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .07
cent lower to .23 cent higher with October at 50.65 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to 1 cent higher with February at
53.10 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures rose on Tuesday while pork bellies retreated.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds rose 5 percent
last month for their best August performance in four years, the
Treasury Department reported Wednesday.
   The department said sales totaled $653 million last month, up
from $622 million sold in August 1989 and the largest amount of
sales for the month since $1.1 billion was posted in 1986. Sales in
July totaled $629 million.
   Last month's sales brought the total amount of bonds sold

million more than during the same period last year.
   Savings bonds currently earn interest at a rate of 7.01 percent

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said today he
expects budget negotiators from the Bush administration and
Congress to agree by week's end to slice $50 billion from the
federal deficit.
   ``I tend to be optimistic we'll reach a conclusion this week,''
Foley, D-Wash., told reporters.
   Negotiators returned to work at Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Maryland for a sixth straight day, hoping to overcome what
they conceded were substantial remaining differences.
   Their mood turned optimistic Tuesday as they moved toward
agreement on a deal that could include higher Medicare premiums and
alcohol taxes and lower Pentagon spending. The package would save
$50 billion next year and $500 billion over the next five years.
   According to officials involved in the talks, the compromise
plan was likely to include $25 billion in new taxes for next year,
including higher levies on alcohol and some luxury items such as
fancy cars.
   Both sides said they were ready to accept larger monthly
premiums for higher-income Medicare recipients. Several proposals
remain alive, all pegging to family income the amount the elderly
pay each month for Medicare coverage of doctors' bills. The current
rate, $28.60 monthly, could increase as much as four-fold under one
plan.
   It would be the first time Medicare benefits were linked to
income.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
``we fully expect there to be an agreement'' on a deficit-reduction
package.
   In his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night,
President Bush said that in the absence of an agreement, both
houses should ``allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500
billion deficit reduction package _ not later than Sept. 28.''
   Asked to elaborate today, Fitzwater said the administration
would submit its own package for such a vote if talks break down.
   In a related development, the General Accounting Office said
today that Congress and the administration should not use the
weakening economy or the Persian Gulf crisis as excuses to avoid a
significant deficit-reduction plan this year.
   The congressional auditing agency offered the advice as it
issued a report saying the deficit could reach a staggering $400
billion next year if the economy slides into a recession.
   In his speech, Bush urged the negotiators to reach agreement by
citing the blows the Middle East crisis has dealt to the U.S.
economy.
   ``To my friends in Congress, together we must act this very
month _ before the next fiscal year begins Oct. 1 _ to get
America's economic house in order,'' Bush said. ``The gulf
situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than
we ever should be.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., one of the negotiators, predicted a
deal is likely within three days. ``I think now, even though we
have a long way to go, I begin to see some daylight,'' he said.
   ``We're on the path,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif. But he suggested the odds of success were only
50-50.
   One official who asked to not be identified said Democrats and
Republicans have agreed to increase taxes and fees by $25 billion
next year and $130 billion over five years.
   The two parties concurred that beer and wine taxes should be
increased, and that levies on luxury items _ such as expensive cars
_ should rise, the official said. Details remained unresolved.
   A major split remained, however, over which other taxes to
boost. Democrats, saying they were protecting the lower and middle
classes, wanted a 10 percent surtax on the incomes of people
earning more than $500,000 annually.
   They also were insisting on higher energy taxes, including an
11-cent-per-gallon increase in the current 9-cent gasoline tax.
   Republicans were demanding a cut in the capital gains tax rate,
which they argue would raise revenues by prodding people to sell
real estate and other property subject to the tax.
   The two sides have dramatically narrowed their differences over
defense cuts, the official said. They are discussing reducing the
$303 billion defense budget by $10 billion to $11 billion next year
and by $170 billion to $200 billion over five years.
   Major differences remain over how deeply domestic programs
should be pared, participants said, with proposals ranging between
$90 billion and $130 billion over five years.
   Unless a deficit-cutting package is in place by Oct. 1, the
Gramm-Rudman law will impose $100 billion in cuts on the $1.2
trillion federal budget. Reductions of that degree would stagger
most federal programs within weeks, officials agree.

<TEXT>
   A taxpayer bailout of commercial banks similar
to the savings and loan rescue may be necessary if the economy
slips into a recession, congressional budget experts told Congress
today.
   ``We're on thin ice, but the pants are still dry,''
Congressional Budget Office Director Robert Reischauer told the
Senate Banking Committee.
   He agreed with an earlier assessment by congressional auditors
that the $13.2 billion Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s bank
insurance fund could face insolvency.
   The General Accounting Office, in the darkest assessment yet of
the nation's banking system, said Tuesday declining real estate
values and risky bank loans might necessitate a taxpayer bailout
for banks if the economy sours.
   ``The fund is too thinly capitalized to deal with the potential
for bank failures in the event of a recession,'' said Comptroller
General Charles Bowsher. ``Such an event could exhaust the fund and
require a taxpayer bailout.''
   Asked today if he agreed with that assessment, Reischauer said,
``There is a possiblity there, yes.''
   Even assuming the economy remains stable, he said, the country
can expect 600 to 700 banks to fail over the next four years at a
net loss to the government of $5 billion to $6 billion a year
unless bank insurance premiums are raised. That would reduce the
annual balance of the fund to $4 billion, he said.
   Legislation removing caps on how much the FDIC can charge for
deposit insurance was introduced today in both the Senate and House
by Sen. Donald Reigle, D-Mich., and Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.
   Government figures do not yet show a recession, but many
economists contend the economy turned downward when unemployment
rose in July and again in August.
   ``Not since its birth during the Great Depression has the
federal system of deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such
a period of danger and uncertainty,'' Bowsher told the Senate panel
Tuesday. ``We have a lot of situations that could wipe the fund
out.''
   With 129 bank failures so far in 1990, FDIC Chairman William
Seidman has estimated the insurance fund will incur a net loss of
at least $2 billion this year atop losses of $5.1 billion in 1988
and 1989.
   Bowsher said the situation is much worse. Including ``several
billions of dollars in losses'' that banks have yet to report,
Bowsher said the insurance fund could already be insolvent.
   At least 15 of this year's bank failures have been among the
nation's 200 largest banks. An additional 20 of the largest 200 are
expect to fail or require bailout assistance in the next year,
Bowsher said. He said total cost to the government would be $4.4
billion to $6.6 billion.
   In addition, the GAO said, the FDIC has a contingent liability
of $8 billion for troubled loans now held by the acquirers of
already-failed banks in Texas.
   Altogether, more than 1,100 of the nation's 13,200 commercial
banks holding some $3.3 trillion in federally insured deposits are
in financial difficulty, the auditors said.
   ``A recession would exacerbate their problems and could lead to
their failing, as well as the failure of other banks,'' the GAO
auditors said in a 124-page report.
   Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the Senate
banking panel, said the banking crisis could be so severe that
Congress might have to reconvene in November to address it rather
than wait until next year for the Bush administration's
recommendations.
   Deciding how to come up with the $63 billion the administration
says it will have to spend on the S&amp;L bailout in fiscal 1991,
beginning Oct.1, is a major factor behind the budget stalemate and
President Bush's reneging on his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   Estimates of the total cost of the thrift cleanup over the next
40 years have ranged from $500 billion to $1 trillion _ or $5,00 to
$10,000 for every American family.

<TEXT>
   Edward Lowe Industries Inc., the maker
of Kitty Litter brand cat box filler, said Wednesday the company
has agreed to sell its marketing and manufacturing operations to an
investment group.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed. The buyer is a group led
by Good Capital Co. Inc. of New York and Knightsbridge Inc. of
Chicago.
   Philip L. Smith, a former chairman and chief executive officer
at Pillsbury and General Foods Corp., wiake daily insulin injections
to survive.
   Symptoms appear after the immune system has destroyed most of
the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas.
   Scientists do not know what triggers that onslaught. But they
have found that the immune system begins attacking several specific
targets long before the disease is diagnosed.
   The new study identifies one of those targets as a beta cell
enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase. The substance is also
found in brain cells, where it helps make a chemical messenger
brain cells use to communicate, said Steinunn Baekkeskov.
   Its role in beta cells is not clearly understood, said
Baekkeskov, assistant professor of microbiology, immunology and
medicine at the Hormone Research Institute of the University of
California, San Francisco, School of Medicine.
   She did the work with colleagues at the institute and scientists
at the Yale University School of Medicine and in Denmark. They
report the results in Thursday's issue of the of the British
journal Nature.
   The discovery should aid research into the substance by leading
to much more abundant supplies of it, either from brain tissue or
from genetic engineering, she said.
   Further research on the enzyme may lead to therapies that
prevent diabetes by stopping the harmful immune system attack
without suppressing the immune system generally, she said.
   But that potential depends on whether the attack on the enzyme
plays any role in causing the disease, which is not yet known, she
said.
   Other future research can follow up indications that a blood
test based on the enzyme can help identify people on the way to
developing diabetes, she said.
   The test looks for proteins of the attacking immune system,
called antibodies, that are specifically aimed at the enzyme. The
antibodies appear in 80 percent of newly diagnosed diabetics, and
they have been detected up to several years before symptoms of the
disease appear, researchers said.
   Antibodies to other targets appear before the diagnosis, too.
But antibodies against the enzyme may be the best predictor of
later diabetes, commented Mark Atkinson, assistant professor of
pathology at the University of Florida College of Medicine in
Gainesville.
   The enzyme antibodies must be studied in more people to better
assess their predictive power, he said.
   Dr. George Eisenbarth of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston
said combining the enzyme antibody test with other antibody tests
may improve the ability to predict insulin-dependent diabetes.
   Currently there is no proven way to prevent the disease in
people who show diabetes-related antibodies. Given the anxiety
caused by a positive test result, Baekkeskov said, early prediction
probably will not be a significant benefit until a prevention
method is found.
   But Eisenbarth said early prediction is useful for finding
people to participate in studies of therapies to prevent the
disease.
   The American Diabetes Association recently endorsed predictive
blood tests for close relatives of insulin-dependent diabetics as a
means of identifying possible participants for prevention studies.

<DATELINE>ZURICH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, said
Wednesday that the planned sale of its Swissotel hotel interests to
the Aoki Corp. of Japan has been dropped.
   A company statement cited recent uncertainty in world financial
markets for the joint decision.
   A spokeswoman added that the recent strength of the Swiss franc
was also responsible. The price, which has not been disclosed, had
been in Swiss francs.
   Analysts have said the deal, announced in March, could have been
worth as much as $577 million.
   The statement said the two parties had agreed to abandon
protracted negotiations after ``realizing that a satisfactory
solution was unlikely to be found.''
   Swissotel has interests in 17 hotels, while Aoki operates 67
hotels under the Westin name and nine others under the Caeser Park
label.
   The statement from the airline's Zurich headquarters said
Swissair would keep all options open on its hotel interests.

   The dollar sank today to a 13-month low against
the Japanese yen and finished lower against most other major
currencies.
   Gold prices moved higher.
   Dealers in London said expectations that U.S. interest rates are
headed lower depressed the dollar. Lower U.S. rates would make the
dollar less appealing to foreign investors.
   But traders said there was a brief flurry of dollar selling
after Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
characterized the struggle against the United States was a ``holy
war,'' and said Moslems who die fighting the U.S. presence in the
Gulf region would go to heaven as martyrs.
   An international force including U.S. troops has been massing in
the Gulf since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Dealers said they did not expect heavy dollar selling in the
next few days as investors await Friday's release of more U.S.
economic data _ figures for August on producer prices, industrial
production and retail sales.
   Some dealers said the dollar has also found support in White
House calls for a quick resolution of U.S. budget deficit reduction
talks.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at a 13-month low of 138.30 Japanese
yen from 139.85 yen at Tuesday's close. It was the dollar's lowest
closing since Aug. 4, 1989, when it finished trading at 138.05 yen.
   Later, in London, the dollar fell to 137.60 yen. At midday in
New York, the dollar was quoted at 137.75 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8650 from $1.8490 late
Tuesday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8655.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.5860 German marks, down from 1.5905; 1.3225
Swiss francs, down from 1.3290; 5.3180 French francs, down from
5.3270; 1.7875 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7935; 1,184.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,186.00; and 1.1623 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1627.
   Selected midday dollar prices in New York included: 1.5875
German marks, 1.32335 Swiss francs, 1,184.125 Italian lire and
1.16455 Canadian dollars.
   Bullion dealers said the statement by Khamenei triggered a
temporary burst of buying, some of it coming from the United States.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $381.75 a troy ounce from
$381.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of
$381.75 an ounce from $381.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents an ounce to $380.20.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $4.82 a troy

   Thirteen states that claim they must
dispose of an unfair share of the nation's hazardous wastes formed
an organization today to pressure the federal government for
changes.
   Representatives of the states, concluding a two-day conference,
voted to organize as States for Responsible and Equitable Waste
Management. The 13 states are among 17 states that receive more
toxic waste for disposal within their borders than they ship out.
   The ``net importer states,'' as they call themselves, say they
might sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enforce its
own toxic waste regulations, or as Congress to change laws.
   They want EPA to crack down on states that have failed to build
disposal sites or to make reciprocal arrangements for handling of
toxic waste generated inside their borders.
   All states ``must share the pain'' of hazardous waste disposal,
said William Child, Illinois' environmental agency manager.
   EPA officials said all 50 states and the District of Columbia
met last October's deadline for submitting proposed plans under a
1986 program, but only 38 were approved by the federal agency.
   Russ Wyer, EPA director of waste management, said the states had
delivered a ``strong message'' that he intends to take back to
Washington.
   ``We will evaluate sanctions'' that could start being imposed in
1991, Wyer said. The agency is still sorting the ``good states from
the bad states.''
   Under EPA rules, the agency could withhold Superfund cleanup
funds from those states that have failed to build toxic waste
disposal sites or reach an agreement with another state in their
region for a site.
   But Wyer said that just 20 states are qualified to receive
Superfund money in the first palce and that the EPA was not
prepared to withhold funds from a cleanup program that involves
public health.
   Alabama and South Carolina, with major hazardous waste landfills
inside their borders, organized the association of ``net importer
states.''
   California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New
York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, South Carolina and Alabama sent
delegates to the meeting.
   Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho and Oregon are among the 17
net-importer states but were not represented.

   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. on
Wednesday unveiled a redesigned 1991 Sentra that will cost 8
percent more and be aimed at more upscale buyers.
   ``It's an absolutely new car, new style and more stylish for the
1990s,'' said Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing U.S.A., the company's automaking arm.
   The base cost will be $7,999, up from $7,399.
   The introduction of the model at Nissan's Smyrna, Tenn., plant
rounds out a new generation of cars and trucks offered by the
Japanese manufacturer since 1988.
   ``With the introduction of seven new models over the past two
years, Nissan's commitment to design and technology leadership is
clear,'' said Robert Thomas, vice president and division manager
for Nissan Motor Corp. in the U.S.A., the company's sales arm.
   Nissan wants to upgrade the image of the Sentra to attract more
affluent customers without losing its core market of entry-level
buyers, Thomas said. ``We would like to get basically the best of
the buyers that need to price in the $8,000 to $12,000 range.
Almost 25 percent of the market is in that range, and those are the
buyers that we need to get,'' Thomas said.
   To that end, Nissan redesigned the Sentra and is offering more
models with new features such as anti-lock brakes.
   ``This new Sentra allows us to change the Sentra imagery of the
last few years,'' Thomas said.
   He predicted sales of 160,000 Sentras for 1991.
   The Sentras, as well as pickup trucks, are built by 3,700
workers at Smyrna, 40 miles southeast of downtown Nashville.
Workers finished producing the 1990 Sentras July 5 and then
switched machinery to produce the redesigned new model.
   The two- and four-dour Sentras have a 1.6-liter, four-cylinder
engine with 110 horsepower. The two-door SE-R model has a
2.0-liter, 140-horsepower engine.
   The Sentra had an internal launch Aug. 6 but was not shown to
the public until Wednesday.
   The Smyrna plant could produce 180,000 units a year, but will
build about 165,000 of the 1991 model, Benefield said.
   Sentra, whose basic design has been unchanged in five years, is
the last Nissan model to undergo a redesign in the last two model
years.
   Among other models, Nissan's 240SX line will have a new
front-end appearance, a 16-valve engine and four-wheel drive
steering in some 1991 models.
   The Stanza will be basically unchanged while the Maxima will
upgrade its standard audio system, include quieter air conditioning
and new-style leather interior in some models.
   The 300ZX lineup adds optional driver's side air bags. The model
also adds a two-seater coupe without T-tops.
   Nissan's four-door Pathfinder makes rear antilock brakes
standard equipment and adds leather seats as an option.
   In the truck line, rear antilock brakes are standard on all 4x4
models.

   Morocco's creditor governments have reached an
agreement that will allow the North African country to reschedule
foreign debt payments by up to 20 years, the French Finance
Ministry said Wednesday.
   It is the first time the lenders have offered such favorable
terms to a highly indebted middle-income country. Previous
recipients of such concessions have been much poorer than Morocco.
   The agreement was reached at a meeting Tuesday of the Paris
Club, a group of officials from creditor governments that meets
occasionally in the French capital to examine debt rescheduling
requests from cash-strapped countries.
   The ministry said the creditor governments agreed to let Morocco
spread repayments on part of its official development aid loans
over 20 years, and rescheduled debt service payments on other
credits over a 15-year period.
   The ministry gave no indication of the amount of rescheduled
debt.
   Morocco is the most debt-burdened country in North Africa and
the Middle East after Egypt, with total foreign debt estimated at
$20 billion.
   The Paris Club rescheduling agreement marks the implementation
of a strategy initiated at July's Economic Summit meeting in
Houston.
   At that time, leaders of the seven biggest industrialized
countries asked the Paris Club to lengthen its repayment periods
for middle-income countries that have implemented strong economic
reform programs.
   Morocco's last appearance before the Paris Club was in October
1989, when creditor governments agreed to roll over some $940
million of debt over 10 years, including a five-year grace period.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Has Impact in 1991 Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concerned about the fiscal impact of the Gulf
crisis, the government Wednesday presented a 1991 budget proposal
calling for a cut in the deficit and a 6.5 percent rise in spending.
   The budget envisions government spending of 1.278 trillion
francs, or about $240 billion, up from 1.2 trillion francs, or
about $235 billion, in 1990.
   Louis Le Pensec, the government spokesman, told reporters the
government had trimmed its proposed spending plan for next year by
8 billion francs, or $1.5 billion, below the initial spending
target.
   He said this cutback was made as a precaution against
uncertainties about the world economy and the price of oil in the
wake of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The draft budget calls for the deficit to fall to 80 billion
francs, or $15 billion, from 90 billion francs, or $16.9 billion,
projected for 1990.
   The budget will cut the tax rate on reinvested corporate profits
to 34 percent from 37 percent in a move that will save an estimated
8 billion francs for companies.
   To encourage companies to spend the saving on productive
investment as opposed to financial speculation, the draft budget
boosts the tax rate on financial capital gains by companies to 23
percent from 19 percent.
   Another key measure will cut the top value added tax rate to 22
percent from 25 percent.
   Le Pensec said the cut will take effect Sept. 13 for cars and
Sept. 17 for other products. This reduction will help to offset
inflationary pressure from rising oil prices, which are projected
in the budget at $25 per barrel.
   Le Pensec said the budget anticipates an annual inflation rate
of 2.8 percent, up from the 2.5 percent that had been forecast for
both 1990 and 1991 in April, before the Iraq-Kuwait crisis
rekindled inflationary fears.
   Gross domestic product is expected to rise 2.7 percent, down
from April forecasts of 3.2 percent growth.

   Japanese purchases of U.S. ``trophies'' such
as Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures had slacked off until a
Tokyo tycoon bought Pebble Beach Co., with its exquisite golf
courses and lone cypress tree.
   But don't be deceived by fewer high-profile deals. The Japanese
appetite for U.S. investment remains powerful, despite Japanese
government pressure to tone down purchases and a nearly 40 percent
drop in the value of stocks in that country this year.
   In fact, the Japanese are making more U.S. investments than
ever, and more sophisticated ones, as they become confident enough
to look past blue-chip targets.
   ``They're becoming insiders in the United States,'' said Jack
Barthell, a managing partner of the Los Angeles accounting firm
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., which closely tracks Japanese investment.
   Nowhere is that more apparent than in real estate, Leventhal's
specialty. Having moved from office buildings to hotels to resorts
and golf courses, the Japanese are now developing property, often
in partnership with U.S. companies, here and abroad, Barthell said.
   While their total real estate investment fell by 11 percent from
1988 to 1989, to $14.8 billion, ``the volume of transactions was
way up,'' Barthell said.
   The Japanese also are moving from primary investment areas, such
as Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, to other
metro areas and the suburbs.
   A Leventhal study showed that four-fifths of total investment
was in the primary areas in 1985; by last year, the figure was
about one-third.
   ``We're finding the very distinct move from the archetypical
downtown trophy office tower to developing single-family
residential in the suburbs, or even apartments,'' Barthell said.
   Another new target zone is Europe, where Japanese real estate
investment last year was twice the level of 1988 and nearly 4{
times that of 1987, according to Clark Whitehill, a British
accounting firm.
   A prominent example of the trends is the Japanese subsidiary
Shuwa Investments Corp., which owns $2.7 billion in U.S. real
estate. Shuwa led the charge into office towers, buying the ITT
Corp. headquarters in New York, the U.S. News and World Report
building in Washington, the Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, and the
Quaker Tower in Chicago.
   But during the past year, Shuwa made different kinds of
headlines: announcing plans to build luxury apartments in Los
Angeles; forming a $154 million partnership with Los Angeles-based
Tishman West Cos. in a London office building.
   Many observers say the Japanese were surprised last year by the
harshness of U.S. reaction to high-profile deals. Those included
Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s $846 million purchase of a controlling
stake in New York's Rockefeller Center, and Sony Corp.'s $3.4
billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   Despite the negative publicity, the Japanese still appear ready
to buy U.S. landmarks if the circumstances are right.
   Those acquainted with this month's deal for Pebble Beach, where
a round of golf can cost $175 and the scenic 17-Mile Drive winds
past the often-photographed lone cypress, say competition was
vicious between two final bidders, both Japanese.
   Finally, businessman Minoru Isutani bought the Monterey property
for more than $800 million from a partnership including Beverly
Hills billionaire Marvin Davis.
   But Davis' asking price was much higher, some say $1.2 billion.
And Isutani is a special case. Because he owns an empire of golf
clubs and sporting goods companies in Japan and abroad, he can
exploit Pebble Beach with cross-memberships and marketing tie-ins
of all sorts.
   So even the top-dollar price for Pebble Beach is not interpreted
as a sign of a new rush for megadeals.
   ``The situations where a guy walked around Manhattan or Waikiki
with a wad of money in his pocket and bought the first overpriced
property are gone,'' said Daniel Schwartz, managing director at
Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York investment bank specializing in
deals involving the Japanese.
   Research at Ulmer Brothers shows the trend extends beyond real
estate to investing in and buying out U.S. businesses. In the first
half of 1990, the company counted 103 such mergers and
acquisitions. That compared with 74 in the first half of 1989 and
47 in the same period in 1988.
   At the same time, the average deal size fell from $162 million
in 1988 to $51 million this year. That reflects the fact that the
Japanese increasingly are taking minority stakes in U.S.
businesses, often to provide new capital, Schwartz said.
   ``A lot of U.S. companies have found themselves in trouble, and
the ones with money are overseas, the Japanese and Europeans,'' he
said.
   The Japanese also have become quicker to back away from
overpriced deals, Schwartz noted. Whitman Corp. had hoped to get
$700 million for its Hussmann Corp. commercial refrigerator unit in
St. Louis, then pulled it off the market when Sanyo Electric Co.'s
bid came in substantially lower, he said.
   Similarly, Hilton Hotels Corp. removed its ``for-sale'' sign
this year after bids came in far below the $120 per share some
analysts expected. Several Japanese companies, including the
leisure and real estate conglomerate EIE International, had been
interested.
   Nowadays, Japanese investments in Midwest steel, automotive and
other manufacturing industries are being praised by such groups as
the Indiana Chamber of Commerce for upgrading the economy of what
once was the ``Rust Belt.''
   Even in Hawaii, where Japanese investments totaling $7.7 billion
have many residents worried that the character of their small state
will be ruined, some deals are welcomed.
   In one such case, Japanese brewing giant Suntory Ltd. bought
control of the Princeville Resort on Kauai in June after the
Australian owner, Qintex, went bankrupt. That allowed construction
to resume on a stalled luxury hotel project.
   Still, the huge island resort deals have drawn more protests
than praise. And they've been strengthened by a trend many
Hawaiians find disturbing: Japanese companies buying property in
Honolulu's older neighborhoods to develop large single-family homes.
   In reaction, Honolulu this year passed a law requiring
nonresident aliens to report real estate deals. Sponsors said it
will help the city develop regulations to control speculative
foreign investments. Similar measures have been proposed at the
state level.
   The Japanese, with their traditions of formality, deference and
courtesy, were keenly aware of American critics, even before the
deals for Rockefeller Center and Columbia, Barthell noted.
   But should they be? Some say the criticism is largely
unwarranted and emotional.
   That's especially true when the assets being purchased are
property, not technology or trade secrets, said David Germany,
senior economist for the Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. securities firm in
New York.
   ``They're not taking away the farm. They're taking away
ownership of a place where rich people play golf,'' Germany said.
``If we can't sell Pebble Beach, what can we sell?''

   Here is a look at the players and issues facing the United Auto
Workers and the Big Three automakers now in negotiations to replace
contracts covering more than 450,000 active workers. The contracts
expire at midnight on Friday, Sept. 14.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHIEF NEGOTIATORS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For the Big Three: General Motors Corp. Vice President Alfred
Warren. Jack Hall, Ford Motor Co. executive director of labor
relations. Chrysler Corp. Vice President Anthony St. John.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For the UAW: UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, head of the
union's GM Department (GM was selected as the UAW bargaining target
on Sept. 28). UAW Vice President Ernest Lofton, head of the union's
Ford Department. UAW Vice President Stan Marshall, head of the
union's Chrysler Department.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The contracts cover about 300,000 active workers at GM, 101,000
at Ford and about 63,000 at Chrysler, for a total of 464,000 for
the Big Three.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CURRENT WAGES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The average hourly base wage, without benefits, is about $14.00
for a Big Three assembly worker, the largest classification of
worker. Depending on the company, benefits can boost that amount
can rise to around $30.00 an hour.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ISSUES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For the Big Three: More flexibility in employee scheduling,
reduction of health costs.
   For the UAW: Job security, wage and pension improvements, more
time off, more accountable management.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MANUFACTURING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current contracts prohibit the closing of any plant except for a
slowdown in sales of its products. When the contracts were signed
(GM and Ford in 1987, Chrysler in 1988), UAW leaders hailed the
provision as a keystone in job security.
   Since 1987, GM has closed four assembly plants (Leeds, Mo.;
Pontiac, Mich.; Framingham, Mass.; and Lakewood assembly in
Atlanta) and Chrysler has closed two (Kenosha, Wis.; and Jefferson
Avenue in Detroit).
   The closings have idled about 20,000 workers.
   The last assembly plant Ford closed was its San Jose, Calif.,
car and truck factory, which ended production in 1983. Since then,
Ford has used overtime to handle additional capacity needs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CORPORATE PROFITS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Profits for each of the Big Three are down from last year. Here
are earnings figures for the second quarter, first half of 1990,
and percentage changes from a year ago:
   GM: $900.1 million, down 40 percent; $1.6 billion, down 47
percent.
   Ford: $770.7 million, down 45 percent; $1.4 billion, down 57
percent.
   Chrysler: $180 million, down 47.2 percent; $251 million, down 64
percent.

<HEAD>Volvo Joining Renault In Bid For Czech Auto Maker Skoda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French auto maker Renault said Wednesday that
Volvo has joined in its bid for a stake in the Czechoslovakian car
company Skoda.
   A Volvo-Renault cross-shareholding agreement signed in February
has not yet been completed, but a spokesman for the French partner
said it made sense for the two car companies to bid jointly for
Skoda.
   ``The latest dossier given to Czech authorities comes from both
Renault and Volvo,'' the spokesman said.
   Recent speculation has placed Renault ahead of rival bidders
Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. in the contest for a large,
possibly controlling interest in Skoda.
   Officials of the prominent East European automaker said in
August that a revised proposal by Renault had improved its chances
in the bidding. State-run Skoda is planning to become a joint stock
company by the end of October.
   Volvo Chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar is expected to join Renault
counterpart Raymond Levy in a delegation heading to Prague.
   Skoda produces nearly 200,000 vehicles a year and earns $100
million annually in hard currency. One-third of the company's cars
are exported.
   The future foreign partner will have to finance investments in
Skoda's plant aimed at doubling output.
   The Renault official said the French group expected a decision
from the Czech government by October.

<HEAD>Crop Futures End Mixed Ahead of USDA Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade ahead of a government crop
report that projected a much larger corn crop than last month's
estimate.
   Corn futures ended modestly lower, soybeans closed slightly
higher and wheat futures finished narrowly mixed in light trading.
   In a report released after the close, the USDA projected the
1990 corn crop at 8.12 billion bushels compared with last month's
estimate of 7.85 billion and market expectations that averaged 7.97
billion.
   The USDA estimated soybean production at 1.84 billion bushels,
unchanged from the government's August estimate, as expected.
   Growing conditions have been largely favorable in the Midwest,
where most of the country's corn and soybeans are grown. But the
most recent weekly USDA crop-progress report showed significant
deterioration of both crops, mainly due to dry weather in the
Mississippi Delta region and the Central Plains.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to { cent higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.66} a bushel;
corn was 1 cent to 2} cents lower with September at $2.38} a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1} cents lower with September at
$1.11{ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with
September at $6.27{ a bushel.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today in a
quiet session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.74 to 2,614.36 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers held a slight edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 685 up, 710 down and
529 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders appeared to respond positively to the
tough line taken by President Bush in his televised comments
Tuesday night on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush seemed to commit the United States to whatever measures
might be necessary to thwart Iraq's effort to annex Kuwait.
   However, investors were evidently in no rush to bid up stocks
until they could see more evidence of the likely future course of
the economy.
   The monthly report due out Friday on the producer price index of
finished goods is expected to show some of the unsettling effects
of the surge in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion on Aug. 2.

<HEAD>Bertelsmann Sees Profit, Sales Up in 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUETERSLOH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bertelsmann AG said Wednesday it
expects net profit to rise by 3.9 percent in the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1991.
   The company also expects a 3 percent gain in sales to 13.7
billion marks, or $8.6 billion.
   Executives of West Germany's largest media group also said
Bertelsmann is moving ahead in establishing a bridgehead in Eastern
Europe for its book clubs, newspapers, magazines, entertainment and
electronic media activities.
   Bertelsmann said it will ``now cautiously relax its policy of
carefully controlled growth and relative investment restraint and
make funds available to further develop its highly profitable core
businesses and to exploit new opportunities that result from the
opening of the Eastern bloc markets and from German unification.''
   The closely-held company, which also has major global
entertainment industry interests via its stable of record companies
including RCA and Arista, on Wednesday revised upward its previous
estimates of fiscal 1990 sales earnings.
   The company reported that net profit in the fiscal year ending
June 30 rose 26.9 percent from a year earlier to 510 million marks
($320 million) from 402 million marks ($252 million).
   Operating earnings gained 10.3 percent last year to 1.005
billion marks ($632 million) from 911 million marks ($573 million).
Sales rose 6.4 percent to 13.3 billion marks ($8.36 billion) from
12.5 billion marks ($7.86 billion).
   In March, the company had forecast a 25 percent increase in its
1990 net profit and a 5 percent increase in sales.
   Bertelsmann Chairman Mark Woessner termed fiscal 1990 as ``a
justly satisfying business year.'' He said the company is aiming
for steady though moderate growth in the fiercely competitive
publishing and entertainment market during the 1990s. Rather than
look for eye-catching corporate acquisitions to boost market share,
Bertelsmann will be aiming to beef up its core activities, he said.
   ``We are not going to be expanding spectacularly,'' he said.
   In the recording sector, the company is still looking for a
partner to launch another U.S. record label, Woessner said.
   In the music sector, Bertelsmann, buoyed by its U.S. and other
recording labels, intends to build its global market share and move
up its ranking from fourth or fifth largest in the world by linking
up with other companies in international entertainment ventures, he
said.
   Bertelsmann is the world's second largest media concern, behind
Time-Warner Inc. of New York.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 workers took part in a
one-day strike at North Sea oil installations Wednesday, oil
company spokesmen and strike leaders said.
   Spokesmen for the Offshore Industries Liaison Committee and for
British Petroleum and Shell said 1,100 to 1,300 workers took part
in the 24-hour action.
   The companies said production was not affected by the strike. A
total work stoppage throughout the British North Sea would affect
10,000 workers on 100 platforms.
   The strikers, who want recognition of unions and higher safety
standards, brought work to a halt on a number of installations in
August.
   They protested the alleged refusal of the employers in the
Offshore Contractors' Council to organize a ballot on union
recognition and the refusal to reinstate 1,500 workers who were
fired for striking.
   The British North Sea suffered the world's worst oil platform
disaster in the Piper Alpha explosion and fire in July 1988 which
killed 167 men.
   A helicopter crash which killed six oil workers on July 25 was
the latest in a string of aircraft accidents in the same oilfields
over the past four years.

   After gobbling up Hawaiian golf courses and
Manhattan office towers, the Japanese now have a craving for
something European.
   The investment opportunities are plentiful with European trade
barriers dissolving in 1992 and potential new markets opening up
with the dearth of communisim in Eastern Europe.
   The Japanese already have been stepping up their investments in
Europe, with development and construction groups, investment firms
and life insurance companies leading the way.
   In European real estate alone, Japanese investments totaled $5.5
billion last year, up from $3.1 billion in 1988, according to the
Clark Whitehill accounting firm in London. For all the years up to
1985, the total investment was only $425 million, the firm said.
   The Japanese are particularly keen on London, where investments
topped $3 billion during 1989, the firm said. That compared with
$2.8 billion spent in New York and $2.6 billion in Los Angeles last
year, according to data from Clark Whitehill and the Kenneth
Leventhal accounting firm in Los Angeles.
   Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Barcelona, Spain, also had heavy
levels of Japanese investments.
   Has the United States lost its allure to the Japanese? No way,
experts say.
   ``A lot of the older players are now looking at Europe,'' said
Daniel Schwartz, managing director of the New York-based Ulmer
Brothers investment bank.
   ``But they're being replaced by newer investors who are looking
at the United States for the first time.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms Kroh Bank Fraud Convictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday reversed
its own ruling and affirmed the conviction of Kansas City developer
John A. Kroh Jr. on 13 bank fraud charges.
   In a 6-3 ruling, the full Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned an earlier three-judge panel's ruling that had reversed
the convictions on all 13 counts.
   Kroh, former president of Kroh Brothers Development Co., once
one of the largest developers in the Kansas City area, was
convicted in 1988 of conspiracy to submit false statements to
federally insured banks, making false statements to federally
insured banks, wire fraud, interstate transportation of money in
execution of a scheme to defraud, and possessing such money.
   Kroh was sentenced to concurrent maximum sentences on all
counts, the longest of which was 10 years.
   His trial focused on his efforts to get $2.3 million in loans
for himself and his brother, George Kroh, from three lending
institutions. According to testimony, the Krohs submitted inflated
financial statements to get the loans.
   Kroh Brothers was one of the area's biggest real estate
companies until it collapsed into bankruptcy in February 1987. In
1986, Kroh Brothers owned 170 properties worth $500 million to $1
billion.
   In his appeal, Kroh contended that the jury was misled by
federal prosecutors who used a guilty plea by George Kroh to imply
that John Kroh was guilty, too. John Kroh also maintained that
prosecution witnesses were allowed to discuss as fact an alleged
check-kiting scheme by John Kroh that was never proved.
   The appeals court said Wednesday that it found all of John
Kroh's contentions to be without merit, noting that George Kroh's
guilty plea was not presented in an inflammatory way and was not
unduly emphasized.
   ``It is obvious from the evidence that John Kroh, in a desperate
scheme to keep KBDC afloat, was knowingly defrauding banks and that
George Kroh was actively participating in the fraudulent scheme,''
the court said.
   Dissenting were Chief Judge Donald P. Lay and Circuit Judges
Frank J. Magill and Theodore McMillian. They said the majority was
wrong in allowing the government to use as one of its chief points
the guilty plea of George Kroh.
   ``John Kroh did not get a fair trial,'' the dissent said. ``This
dissent is written vigorously with the hope that trial judges
exercise great care and oversight when the government attempts to
use guilty pleas of co-conspirators. When ... the government's
obvious purpose in calling a co-conspirator is not to adduce
necessary evidence but simply to introduce a guilty plea which
directly implicates a defendant, the plea should be excluded.''
   John Kroh is detained at the federal work camp at Duluth, Minn.,
where he has served about 20 months. George Kroh served about two
months of a three-year sentence and was released before his
brother's trial.

<HEAD>Court Says Ruling Stands on Nuclear Cost Overruns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf States Utilities will not get a second chance
to convince state regulators that its customers should pay an
additional $1.4 billion in nuclear plant construction costs, the
Texas Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
   Consumer representatives praised the decision, while the
Beaumont-based utility said it will continue fighting.
   ``We have several legal avenues open to us and we will do
whatever is necessary to keep this open,'' said Susan Gilley, GSU
spokeswoman.
   She said the utility will file a motion for a rehearing before
the state Supreme Court, and if that fails, will appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   The Public Utility Commission, in an earlier rate case, had
allowed Gulf States to put into electric rates $1.6 billion of
construction costs at the River Bend nuclear power plant in
Louisiana.
   The commission left $1.45 billion in costs pending at the time.
   Gulf States wanted to return to the PUC to try to add these
costs to customers' bills.
   But that move was challenged by some southeast Texas cities
served by the utility, who said it was unfair for the utility to
have another chance to prove those expenditures were prudent
construction costs.
   A trial court agreed with the cities, but that decision was
overturned by the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals.
   On Wednesday, the Texas Supreme Court agreed with the trial
court and the cities.
   ``We agree that the public utility regulatory scheme set forth
by the Legislature provides that once is enough,'' Justice Lloyd
Doggett wrote in the 7-2 majority.
   Grace Casstevens, an attorney who represented several towns that
fought Gulf States, said the court's decision ``was exactly what we
had been urging.''
   ``This is a real victory for ratepayers,'' said another
attorney, Jim Boyle, who represented the Coalition of Cities for
Affordable Utility Rates in the case, said.
   ``The Supreme Court agreed that consumers should not have to pay
for imprudent costs of building a nuclear power plant. These costs
must be borne by the stockholders,'' Boyle said.

   A late flurry of buying helped stock prices post
a moderate gain today in a quiet session.
   Analysts said traders appeared to respond positively to the
tough line taken by President Bush in his televised comments
Tuesday night on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush seemed to commit the United States to whatever measures
might be necessary to thwart Iraq's effort to annex Kuwait.
   However, investors were evidently in no rush to bid up stocks
until they could see more evidence of the likely future course of
the economy.
   The monthly report due out Friday on the producer price index of
finished goods is expected to show some of the unsettling effects
of the surge in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion on Aug. 2.

   Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC, is in talks to
sell some of its non-strategic businesses, chairman Robert Maxwell
said Wednesday.
   ``Negotiations are well advanced in a number of transactions
which we expect to complete very shortly,'' Maxwell told
shareholders at the company's annual meeting. He declined to give
details of what businesses were involved.
   Maxwell Communications' holdings include U.S. publisher
Macmillan Inc. and the U.S.-based Official Airlines Guide.
   Maxwell said the London-based communications and publishing
giant intends to repay some $400 million in bank debt by Oct. 23.
   ``We do not enjoy being a highly-leveraged business,'' Maxwell
said. ``We want to get back to being as we always have been, an
equity-led business.''
   Publishing and professional information operations are trading
strongly, Maxwell said, particularly in North America, where the
company makes more than 80 percent of its sales.
   Maxwell shares closed up one pence, or 1.8 cents, at 167 pence
($3.00) on the London Stock Exchange.

   Oil companies are pleased to hear President Bush
calling for more domestic exploration, but they said Wednesday it's
going take more than words from Washington before they step up
their drilling.
   The American Petroleum Institute said Bush's support for
increased exploration and oil company tax breaks echoes some of
what the industry has been asking for. But it remains to be seen
whether Congress will go along.
   In a televised speech Tuesday night, Bush asked lawmakers to
speed the development of oil reserves in Alaska and increase
incentives for oil and gas exploration.
   ``In general, he was saying what we would like to hear, because
our industry is in the doldrums,'' said James Merna, spokesman for
the Independent Petroleum Association of America. ``But he just
didn't come up with the specifics.''
   Environmental groups did not wait for specifics to blast Bush's
call for more oil wells, including the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska, believed to contain the nation's largest
untapped, on-shore reserve of crude oil.
   ``He's an old oil man, and all he can think of in terms of the
shortage is to drill more,'' said Dru Schmidt-Perkins, conservation
analyst for the Energy Conservation Coalition in Washington.
   Bush shows few signs of supporting the conservation measures
that are touted by environmentalists as the solution to cutting
U.S. dependence on foreign oil, Ms. Schmidt-Perkins said.
   The oil industry says more exploration is part of the answer to
reducing America's addiction to overseas crude. But despite the
rapid rise in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2, and the subsequent boycott of their oil, there has been no
rush to find more oil.
   The major oil companies say they would need to see higher oil
prices in a more stable market for a sustained period before they
would bolster their drilling plans. Majors account for a small
proportion of the wells that are drilled domestically, but they
tend to go after larger pools of oil in more expensive projects.
   ``We'll have to look at prices today, plus what is a reasonable
outlook for prices in two to five years and even longer,'' said
Michael E. Thompson, a spokesman for Amoco Corp. ``Many of these
projects are five- or 10- or 20-year projects.''
   The major oil companies have not even been able to see yet what
the Persian Gulf crisis will do to their earnings in the short run,
he said.
   Smaller, independent oil companies drill about 85 percent of the
nation's wells, according to IPAA, which represents smaller
companies. Its members could use some tax breaks to get out of the
economic slump that set in when the price of oil collapsed in the
mid 1980s.
   Independent oil operators used to borrow cash for drilling, but
many of the companies and the banks that loaned them money have now
gone under, said Lloyd N. Unsell, acting president of IPAA. The
number of independent producers has fallen from about 13,000 to
4,500 since the bust, and Unsell said tax incentives might be
necessary before investors will decide to pump money into oil deals.
   Although Unsell hopes Bush's remarks and the Persian Gulf
standoff might change the minds of those in Congress who oppose the
industry, he called it ``a shame you have to have a crisis to get
the government to consider some of the energy options we have here
at home that have been begging for several years.''
   The oil industry believes Congress has tilted toward the
environmental side when oil from overseas stayed so cheap for so
many years, even though companies say they can produce oil without
undue harm to the environment.
   Ms. Schmidt-Perkins points to the massive oil spill caused by
the Exxon Valdez as evidence to the contrary.
   ``Drilling in places like the Arctic is extremely dangerous,''
she said. ``They'll go in there and drill like crazy, and if they
find oil, they'll have to find a way to get it out of there.''

<HEAD>Sears Announces Frequent Buyer Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. on Wednesday unveiled a
frequent-buyer program aimed at boosting retail sales by rewarding
shoppers who charge merchandise on their Sears credit cards.
   The SearsCharge Bonus Club, which begins Sept. 15, is Sears'
first major promotional effort since Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Edward A. Brennan assumed direct control of the company's
ailing retail division last month.
   Under the program, shoppers who charge merchandise from Sears
stores on their Sears accounts automatically will earn credit
toward certificates valued at 1 percent of their purchases.
   Each time customers accumulate $200 or more in SearsCharge
purchases after Sept. 15, they will receive certificates valued at
1 percent of those purchases in their regular monthly billing
statements.
   The certificates can be applied toward future purchases at Sears.
   The program does not include the Discover Card, a
general-purpose credit card offered by Sears.
   ``Our credit customers are very important to us,'' said Laurence
Cudmore, president of retail for the Sears Merchandise Group.
   ``This is our way of thanking them for their loyalty and
inviting them back again to shop at Sears,'' Cudmore said in a news
release.
   Sears said it succesfully had tested the bonus club concept at
16 stores in the Baltimore and Pittsburgh areas since late 1989.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer, is fighting to boost its
retail sales and reverse a slide in market share.
   A much ballyhooed switch to everyday low pricing and
superstore-type merchandising over the past two years has yielded
disappointing results, prompting Sears' board to put Brennan
directly in charge of the merchandise group.
   Michael Bozic, formerly chairman and chief executive of the
merchandise group, was reassigned to the newly created position of
president of the division. He assumed responsibility for logistics
and the group's catalog.
   Sears' other operations include Allstate insurance services,
Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage services, and Coldwell Banker real
estate services.

   National contract negotiations between General
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday were
``percolating,'' according to a UAW official, but there was no word
on how much progress was being made.
   ``Things are moving,'' said the official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. He refused to provide details.
   There were reports that UAW President Owen Bieber and GM
Chairman Robert Stempel met Wednesday morning, but sources on both
sides of the bargaining declined to confirm or deny that the
high-level meeting took place.
   Talks bogged down Monday over the critical issue of job
security, but picked up Tuesday and Wednesday, the official said.
The union has said for months that guaranteeing employment for its
members is the top issue in the current round of talks.
   GM spokesman John Maciarz had no comment on the talks Wednesday.
He said, however, that he knew of no official news blackout.
Sometimes, especially late in the bargaining process, a news
blackout is an indication that talks are moving rapidly toward
agreement.
   Negotiators were working against a midnight Friday national
contract expiration, the same time as UAW contracts with Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. die. More than 450,000 active workers,
300,000 of them at GM, are covered by the three agreements.
   Talks between the union and Ford and Chrysler have been put on
hold pending the outcome of the GM negotiations. The union wants to
use a contract ratified by GM workers as a pattern for agreements
with Ford and Chrysler.
   At GM, negotiators have been focusing on economic issues in the
final days of talks. UAW officials said tentative agreements have
been reached on nearly all non-economic issues, including legal
assistance and military leave provisions.
   Analysts say a strike remains a likely possibility, but the
specter of Japanese competition in the auto market looms large in
the talks. Even a short strike could cut inventories of cars below
optimum levels and push customers toward Japanese products, which
now account for nearly 30 percent of the new-car market.

<HEAD>State and ARCO Settle 13-Year-Old Suit Over Royalties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ARCO Alaska Inc. and its parent
company, Atlantic Richfield Co., will pay the state about $285
million under an agreement to settle part of a 13-year-old suit
over oil royalties, Gov. Steve Cowper said Wednesday.
   The payment settles involvement by ARCO in what became known as
the ``Amerada Hess case,'' after the first company on an
alphabetical list of defendants.
   Alaska officials contend the state was shorted $902 million in
royalties for oil from the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River fields
between 1977 and 1986.
   The state charged the oil companies often undervalued the North
Slope crude, therefore paying the state less than it should have
received.
   Cowper said it would be difficult to calculate what the state
may have lost by agreeing to settle out of court because the
procedure would require a number of projections, including
anticipating the likely outcome of appeals.
   ``If your question is how much the state gave up, you'd have to
be a fortune-teller,'' the governor said.
   The state is continuing its case against the nine or 10 other
defendants, and a trial is expected in about a year, Cowper said.
   The first company to settle, Amerada Hess Corp., paid the state
$310,000 last year.
   The settlement announced Wednesday ends ``a long and arduous
process'' of negotiations with ARCO, the governor said, indicating
the settlement has been in the works since March.
   ``The reason the case was settled was that it was clear to ARCO
that the state's case was in good shape,'' he said. ``We do have
ongoing negotiations with other companies.''
   Twenty-five percent of the payment will go into the Alaska
Permanent Fund with the rest headed for a statutory budget reserve,
the governor said.
   ARCO said in a statement that the payment would result in an
after-tax charge of $25 million in the company's third quarter.
   Besides the payment, the agreement provides a methodology for
calculating future oil royalties on most of the company's current
Alaskan North Slope leases, the statement said.
   ``This methodology is is intended to reduce the potential for
future conflict and provide an effective means of resolving
issues,'' said William E. Wade Jr., vice chairman of ARCO Alaska.
   ``As a result of the settlement of negotiations, substantial
progress was made not only in resolving the royalty issues in
dispute, but also in promoting the development and nurturing of
better communications and constructive working relationships
between ARCO and the state of Alaska,'' he said in the statement.

   A Columbus, Ohio, stock brokerage and its
president, accused of numerous fraud schemes, were expelled from
the National Association of Securities Dealers Wednesday and fined
a total of $250,000.
   Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, Corna and Co., Inc.
and its owner and president, David A. Corna, agreed to the
disciplinary action as part of a settlement with the NASD, a
self-regulating organization empowered by Congress to oversee the
over-the-counter securities market.
   The firm and Corna were accused of parking securities and making
unauthorized trades in clients' accounts ``on hundreds of occasions
between 1985 and 1989,'' playing fast and loose with its records _
including creating two bogus customer accounts _ falsifying
documents, and not cooperating with an NASD investigation.
   Parking is an illegal scheme to conceal the true ownership of
securities by buying them with the understanding that the original
owner will buy them back with no loss to the person they were
``parked'' with.
   The NASD's Cleveland Business Conduct Committee said ``the
conduct at issue represents some of the most serious violations of
the federal securities laws and the rules of the Association that
can be a committed by a member. ...''
   The disciplinary committee also accused Corna of forging the
signatures of several customers and former employees.
   The firm was censured, expelled from membership in the NASD and
fined $100,000. Corna also was censured, barred from associating
with any NASD member in any capacity and fined $150,000.

   GTE Airfone and COMSAT Aeronautical
Services announced Wednesday they reached a service agreement that
will allow airline passengers to make telephone calls while flying
anywhere in the world.
   The two companies will begin operating a global, satellite-based
aircraft communications system in mid-1991.
   Currently users of the GTE Airfone Service can place a telephone
call while flying over the continental United States, southern
Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and within
200 miles of the U.S. coastline.
   Under the agreement, GTE Airfone will use COMSAT's network of
ground earth stations in Southbury, Conn., and Santa Paula, Calif.,
to expand passenger telephone service to international flights.
COMSAT will also provide the space segment through the
International Maritime Satellite Organization global satellite
network.
   GTE has not determined what it will charge customers to use the
service, said Mark S. Schneider, GTE Airfone marketing vice
president. GTE Airfone, based in Oak Brook, is part of the GTE
Mobil Communications Group.
   ``COMSAT is especially pleased to be working with GTE Airfone in

said Elizabeth Young, vice president for the company based in
Washington
   Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

   The stock market put together a modest advance
in late trading Wednesday as traders kept watch on developments in
the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had drifted down
5.93 points in the week's first two sessions, rose 13.12 to
2,625.74.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
778 up, 638 down and 539 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 129.89 million
shares, against 113.22 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 157.49 million shares.
   Analysts said traders appeared to respond positively to the
tough line taken by President Bush in his televised comments

   Bush seemed to commit the United States to whatever measures

   The monthly report due out Friday on the producer price index of
finished goods is expected to show some of the unsettling effects
of the surge in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion on Aug. 2.
   The index, which is designed to measure inflationary pressures
at the next-to-last point in the distribution pipeline, is expected
to show an increase in the neighborhood of 1.3 percent to 1.5
percent for August. It was down 0.1 percent in July.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was actively traded, down { at
30|. Analysts quoted in a Wall Street Journal article gave a
cautious view of the company's earnings outlook for this year and
next.
   Pollution-control issues also were weak. Browning-Ferris
Industries fell 1{ to 33 and Waste Management dropped } to 35{.
   Energy stocks, by contrast, were mostly higher as crude oil
prices chalked up moderate gains. Texaco climbed 1} to 64&rsqb;; Chevron

   Moving to end allegedly unfair pricing by
trans-Pacific shipping firms, the Federal Maritime Commission on
Wednesday announced it has levied $20.5 million in penalties
against nine companies.
   James J. Carey, the commission's acting chairman, said the
penalty settlement is by far the largest in the agency's 29-year

   ``It is five times larger than any previous penalty and indeed
larger than the commission's annual budget'' of some $15 million,
Carey said.
   The commission's action is aimed at ending a practice in the
shipping industry of filing tariffs with the commission, then
privately paying rebates to attract cargo business, commission
sources said.
   ``The primary value of this matter lies elsewhere than in

   According to the commission, shippers participating in the
settlement are:

<HEAD>Corn Futures Expected to Fall Following Bigger Crop Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain analysts predicted a sharp drop in corn futures prices
after the government released a harvest projection Wednesday that
exceeded nearly everyone's expectations.
   Corn futures posted modest losses on the Chicago Board of Trade
ahead of the monthly Agriculture Department report while soybean
prices rose and wheat finished narrowly mixed.
   On other commodity markets, near-term cotton futures rose
sharply; oil futures were mixed; precious metals advanced; cattle
futures fell; and most pork futures rose.
   In light-volume grain trading in Chicago, wheat futures settled
1 cent lower to { cent higher with the contract for delivery in
September at $2.66} a bushel; corn was } cent to 2\ cents lower
with September at $2.39\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1} cents
lower with September at $1.11{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3
cents higher with September at $6.28{ a bushel.
   After the close, the USDA released a crop report estimating the
1990 U.S. corn crop at 8.12 billion bushels, up 8 percent from last
year's crop and 3 percent more than the government forecast a month
ago.
   Analysts' pre-report expectations averaged 7.97 billion bushels
vs. last month's USDA estimate of 7.85 billion and last year's
harvest of 7.53 billion bushels.
   Grain analysts said the surprisingly high number apparently
reflected the ideal growing conditions that prevailed in the
Midwest this summer until the past two weeks, when the weather
turned unusually dry. The crop report was based on crop conditions
as of Sept. 1.
   Richard Feltes, director of commodities research at the
Chicago-based futures brokerage Refco Inc., said 1990 will go down
as one of only a handful of years since 1950 in which precipitation
in the Corn Belt states during June, July and August exceeded the
norm.
   He said the USDA was ``very bold'' to raise its corn production
estimate so dramatically with only a small fraction of the crop
harvested.
   ``This suggests that the crop on subsequent reports could be
even larger,'' Feltes said. ``We're going to have to find a lower
price to encourage consumption.''
   Walter Spilka of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said corn
futures probably would open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower
Thursday in reaction to the report.
   But Spilka said the USDA forecast may be too optimistic in light
of the recent dry weather. He said next month's corn estimate may
be smaller, not larger, than Wednesday's.
   ``The crop may end up near 8.05 billion bushels,'' Spilka said.
   Normal rainfall should return to the Corn Belt in the latter
half of next week, according to a National Weather Service forecast
released after the close.
   The USDA estimated soybean production at 1.84 billion bushels,
unchanged from the government's August estimate, as expected.
   Steady rain in the Mississippi Delta region has helped the
soybean crop there this week but hurt early-blooming cotton,
resulting in a sharp increase in October cotton futures on the New
York Cotton Exchange.
   Some traders had expected the Delta to produce cotton early
enough to be delivered against the October contract but those hopes
have been washed out with the rain, said Ernest Simon, cotton
specialist with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Cotton futures settled .05 cent lower to 1.73 cents higher with
October up 1.73 cents at 73.90 cents a pound.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures rose moderately but heating oil
futures ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in volatile
trading that followed the latest reports from the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude oil finished 21 cents to 69 cents higher with
October at $30.97 a barrel; wholesale heating oil was .73 cent
lower to .18 cent higher with October at 82.59 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .23 cent to .41 cent higher with October at
93.84 cents a gallon.
   Higher crude prices fueled inflation fears and helped lift gold
and silver futures on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1.50 higher across the board with September at
$382.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2.3 cents to 2.4 cents higher with
September at $4.801 a troy ounce.
   Profit-taking pressured cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange but pork futures settled mostly higher, boosted by strong
gains in pork bellies after a weekly exchange report showed a
larger-than-expected drawdown of frozen stocks last week.
   Live cattle futures ended .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
October at 78.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .33
cent lower with September at 87.60 cents a pound; live hogs were
.30 cent lower to .22 cent higher with October at 50.67 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.55 cents to the permitted daily
limit of 2 cents higher with February at 54.60 cents a pound.

   A high school band played and K mart
Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini beamed as a tarpaulin dropped
Wednesday revealing a new storefront logo that will mark the
discounter's remodeled outlets.
   The big red K on the pale gray facade will signify the stores
that have been done over in K mart's $2.3 billion, 5-year
renovation plan, Antonini told a news conference in the parking lot
of the Oak Park prototype store.
   The familiar turquoise m-a-r-t following the K has been replaced
with a white script m-a-r-t angled upward within a bright red K.
Workmen unveiled a similar logo on the streetside sign as Antonini
and others spoke.
   ``We thought the signature within the K was a good counterpoint
to the aggressiveness and assertiveness of the K,'' said Ken Love,
partner and creative director at Anspach, Grossman, Portugal Inc.
of New York, which designed the logo.
   A few customers paused with their carts in the lot to watch the
new symbol unveiled.
   ``Looks more compact. Looks neater,'' said Dolores Gildenpfenig,
comparing the new logo to the one that has remained virtually
unaltered since the former S.S. Kresge Co. opened the first K mart
discount store in 1962 in Garden City, Mich.
   Her husband, Harold Gildenpfenig, said the couple were frequent
shoppers at the Oak Park K mart and a new logo would make little
difference.
   ``The change in the logo isn't the essential thing, it's the
message that the company is doing something different,'' said Mike
Wellman, K mart vice president of marketing, who was among
executives mingling in the parking lot.
   K mart had announced its plans earlier in the year to remodel
all its stores along the lines of the Oak Park store with its
brighter lights and wider aisles.
   Anthony Camilletti of the Berkley store design company Jon
Greenberg &amp; Associates said JGA designers talked with K mart
officials while helping to design the Oak Park store last year
about developing a storefront that would incorporate a new logo.
   ``It will have a direct impact that there is something different
about this store, they will most definitely recognize a
difference,'' Camilletti said.
   The new ``retail identity symbol'' will appear on existing
stores as they are refurbished and on all newly built stores. The
retailer currently operates 2,331 K mart stores throughout the
country.

<HEAD>Canadian Auto Union Rejects Ford's Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Auto Workers union on Wednesday
rejected an offer made by Ford Motor Co. of Canada as a strike
deadline loomed on Friday.
   ``(The offer) doesn't go close to forming the basis of a
settlement,'' said union leader Bob White, adding that a strike by
12,800 Ford workers at midnight Friday night looked inevitable.
   ``I've been here before and I've seen things move quickly, but
you would have to be extremely optimistic to think that we could do
this by Friday midnight,'' White said during a break in
negotiations.
   ``Even if we fall into a strike we will stay here. The last
thing we want to do is walk away.''
   The union has a $40 million strike fund to support a long
strike, White said.
   Company spokesman Jim Hartford declined to provide details of
the offer, but said it covered ``economic elements'' such as wages,
vacations and cost-of-living allowances.
   ``We believe it can form the basis of a settlement,'' Hartford
said Wednesday morning.
   The talks began Aug. 5 after the union picked Ford as its strike
target. Any contract reached will serve as the model for later
talks with the Canadian divisions of General Motors and Chrysler.
   The union has not said how much of a raise it wants. Ford
workers now earn a base rate of $17.83 an hour.
   Union negotiators are also demanding more time off for workers
and increased job security.
   Ford of Canada has not had a strike since 1976.

<HEAD>Advanced Micro Devices Loses Computer Chip Patent Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case that breaks legal ground, Advanced
Micro Devices Corp. has lost a patent infringement lawsuit brought
by another computer chip company, Brooktree Corp. of San Diego.
   A U.S. District Court jury on Tuesday found that the
Sunnyvale-based AMD violated three of Brooktree's patents and also
infringed on the company's rights to protect chip layout designs
under a 1984 law.
   The judge and jury in San Diego have not yet set damages.
Brooktree has asked for ``more than millions of dollars,'' said
company President James Bixby.
   AMD said it was shocked by the ruling and planned to appeal as
soon as damages were determined. It also has its own patent
infringement suit pending against Brooktree.
   ``We did not copy Brooktree's designs,'' said AMD's president
and chief operating officer, Anthony Previte. ``AMD absolutely does
not condone violations of intellectual property rights.''
   The Brooktree suit has been closely watched as the first major
test of the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, which made
illegal the use of photographic techniques and other methods to
copy the intricate circuitry of computer chips.
   Brooktree's 1988 suit initially accused AMD of illegally copying
the layout of its chips. It was then expanded to include
infringement of three patents after Brooktree received them the
following year.
   The suit covers chips known as color palettes, which control the
display of colors on computer screens. Color palettes make up less
than 1 percent of AMD's business.
   AMD entered the market for palette chips first, but Brooktree
later introduced an improved design. AMD emulated Brooktree's
approach but said it did so through a legal procedure known as
reverse engineering.

<HEAD>Five Days of $30 Oil Makes Traders Wonder If It Will Last</HEAD>

   Oil futures rose in choppy trading Wednesday,
and after five straight closes over $30 per barrel, traders
wondered whether crude was settling into a higher range of prices.
   ``That's what everybody's wondering. Are we starting to form a
base here?'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude for October delivery closed 21 cents higher at
$30.97 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude has closed over $30 per barrel every day since Sept. 6,
despite a lack of major news from the Middle East that would be
perceived as bullish.
   So far, there has been no repeat of the sharp tumble that
knocked oil out of the $30 range three days after it hit that
plateau last month for the first time in nearly five years.
   On Wednesday, oil opened higher on news that Iran's spiritual
leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considers the Mideast struggle
against the United States to be a holy war that will enable Moslems
who are killed to go to heaven as martyrs.
   It fell as traders contemplated an earlier report indicating
U.S. supplies are adequate for the time being, then rallied in the
afternoon when speculators decided it was time to start buying
October futures again.
   The spread between October and November contracts became narrow
enough that some speculators decided to hedge their bets by selling
November oil and buying October oil, Hittle said.
   ``They think the spread will widen,'' she said.
   Crude oil contracts for later months also moved higher
Wednesday, with the rises progressively larger further into the
future.
   That was a sign that traders think the oil crisis might persist,
although for the near term, there will be enough crude on hand to
meet demand, Hittle said.
   During much of Wednesday's trading, prices were held down in
response to the American Petroleum Institute's report a day earlier
indicating that supplies of crude, gasoline and home heating oil
were higher than in the previous week.
   Among other petroleum-based products traded on the Merc,
unleaded gasoline for October closed up .24 cent at 93.84 cents per
gallon, and later contract months were up.
   Home heating oil was down .44 cent at 82.59 cents per gallon,
while later months were mixed.
   Natural gas for October rose to $1.543 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frozen for nearly 100 years in the same
position _ his ear pricked up to the sound of a gramophone _ Nipper
the RCA dog is coming to life and gaining a smart-alecky sidekick.
   In television commercials airing for the first time Sunday, the
internationally known RCA mascot and his new companion will promote
a new line of ``Home Theatre'' color television models and a lineup
of 8mm camcorders, RCA's parent company announced Wednesday.
   ``The two dogs will serve as an appropriate `balancing act' as
we continue to expand our customer base,'' said Martin J. Holleran,
president and chief executive officer of Thomson Consumer
Electronics' American sales and marketing divison.
   ``The younger dog is the focus for the new designs and advanced
features of today's RCA products, while `Nipper' represents RCA's
traditional values of reliability and ease of use,'' he said.
   Thompson is a French-owned company that bought the RCA and GE
home electronics lines from General Electric Co. in 1987.
   Executives of Thompson wrestled with the idea of bringing Nipper
back for advertisements for several years, said spokesman Greg
Zehner.
   ``It's just that we couldn't figure out how to make him work
best,'' he said. ``It was too dated.''
   Ammirati &amp; Puris, a New York advertising firm, suggested earlier
this year that the company use a live dog to represent Nipper and
find a look-alike puppy to play the more modern role.
   ``We knew we had to update him, so we invented this little
whippersnapper to be his foil,'' said David Fowler, an associate
creative director at Ammirati &amp; Puris who worked on the new
campaign.
   Nipper was created in the 1890s by London painter Francis
Barraud. Barraud depicted the terrier listening to ``His Master's
Voice'' emanating from a gramophone. He sold the painting to the
Gramophone Co. after replacing the cylinder-type phonograph with a
disc version.
   In 1900, the North American rights to the painting were acquired
and Nipper was used to launch the Consolidated Talking Machine Co.,
later to become the Victor Talking Machine Co. RCA purchased Victor
and the rights to use Nipper in 1929.
   RCA, in turn, was bought by GE in 1986. GE continues to use the
RCA name for some products, but it sold the RCA and GE names for
home electronics to Thomson.
   ``He is one of the oldest advertising syumbols in the world,''
Fowler said. ``The Coca-Cola symbol is the only better known symbol
in the world than the dog and the horn.''
   Before bringing Nipper back, Ammirati conducted a survey to
judge his name recognition and popularity.
   ``We went all over the country, asking whether they like him,
whether we should keep him,'' Fowler said. ``And people told us,
`Are you kidding? Of course you have to use Nipper.'
   ``We didn't bring him back simply for nostalgic benefit because
nostalgia is anathema to electronics. We brought him back because
he's a good symbol.''
   The agency found the dogs for the ads in a New York animal
shelter run by animal trainers. The new Nipper was insured for
$500,000 before seven days of filming this summer, Fowler said.
   Two of the commercials will debut Sunday night on ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' Fowler said. Each of the spots
contains three vignettes demonstrating RCA product features. Nipper
and his sidekick will also appear in print advertising and on the
company's brochures.
   In all the advertisements, the puppy plays the part of the
adventurous, wise-cracking offspring who always gets the best of
Nipper.
   ``He's sort of a smart aleck, a hot dog, a little hot shot,''
Fowler said. ``He's like you. He has all the answers and he's not
afraid to talk about them. The big dog is more staid, like your
father.''
   ``We hope they can tell the company's story for the next 100
years,'' Fowler said.

   The Transportation Department will allow
Scandinavian Airlines System to buy out most of Frank Lorenzo's
interest in Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the department said
Wednesday.
   The move will nearly double SAS's stake in the parent company of
Continental Airlines through a $52.5 million stock purchase.
   Under the deal approved by the department, Scandanavian Airlines
will own 16.8 percent of Continental and 18.4 percent of its voting
stock, and will be given three seats on the holding company's
15-member board.
   However, SAS agreed to not buy more than 22 percent of
Continental's voting stock for three years. It cannot own more than
25 percent because of U.S. laws requiring that domestic airlines be
controlled by Americans. SAS already owned 9.9 percent of
Continental's voting stock.
   SAS agreed to buy 2.25 million shares of newly issued
Continental stock for $31.5 million and will pay another $21
million to buy Jet Capital Corp., which owns another 2.1 million
shares of Continental stock. The Jet Capital stock was owned by
Lorenzo.
   Lorenzo, who continues to own some 800,000 shares of the
company, resigned last month as chief executive officer of
Continental and has been replaced by Hollis Harris, former
president of Delta Airlines.
   Some Continental shareholders have filed lawsuits in Delaware
Chancery Court asking that the transactions among Continental, Jet
Capital, Lorenzo and SAS be blocked. They argued the deals were
``entered into in breech of fiduciary duties owed to Continental
and Continental shareholders.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines filed a suit Wednesday to
overturn a government decision allowing United Airlines landing
priorities at the nation's busiest airport.
   A scheduling battle between two of the largest U.S. carriers
intensified when the Federal Aviation Administration announced
earlier in the day approval of new scheduling proposed by United at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and blamed American for
causing delays.
   FAA officials said that some evening flights into Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport would be subject to substantial delays
over the next two weeks, until the new agreement takes effect Oct.
1.
   They blamed American, saying the airline, in a new schedule,
pulled out of an operating agreement and increased arrivals at
Chicago during early evening hours.
   The approved plan allows United to move some of its flights
ahead of American flights.
   ``This outrageous action by the FAA gives United, already the
dominant carrier at O'Hare, an unfair and illegal competitive
advantage,'' said Anne McNamara, American's senior vice president
and general counsel.
   ``The FAA's decision blessed a `sweetheart deal' struck behind
closed doors in August between the FAA and United and allows the
Chicago-based carrier to leapfrog American's schedule at O'Hare at
critical times of the day,'' she said.
   United praised the FAA action, saying its schedule was designed
to reduce delays and congestion at Chicago. The Chicago-based
airline, in a statement, accused American of making ``efforts to
prevent those improvements.''
   The American suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, seeks to overturn the FAA decision affecting United
flights, saying it represents unlawful agency favoritism and gives
United an unfair competitive advantage. The FAA was given until
Monday to respond to the complaint.
   FAA officials said the situation was caused when American
Airlines pulled out of an operating agreement, announcing it would
increase arrivals between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., substantially
exceeding airport capacity.
   Delays at O'Hare, a major crossroads for flights around the
country, often cause delays at other airports as well.
   But the FAA said the agreement with United would reduce arrival
peaks and associated delays at O'Hare after Oct. 1.
   Until then, ``the public can continue to expect substantial
delays at O'Hare,'' the FAA said.
   The FAA said United, after learning of the new American
schedule, asked for and received permission to move its incoming
flights in the early evening hours away from the new American
arrival times.
   American spokesman John Hotard said American had been losing
money and passengers to United because of United's scheduling. In
one example, United moved a Chicago-Washington flight from 8:05
p.m. to 7:40 p.m., 10 minutes ahead of an American flight to
Washington.
   ``At a crowded airport like Chicago, very susceptible to delays
and weather, the guy who takes off second and lands second is the
guy who gets stacked up,'' Hotard said.
   He said the original times used by the two airlines were fair
because ``sometimes we take off first, sometimes they take off
first.''

<HEAD>Trial Date Set in Airline Maintenance Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday set a trial date
for early next year for Eastern Airlines and eight former managers
accused of routinely ignoring vital aircraft repairs and falsifying
safety records.
   Eastern and nine company officials _ including Edward Upton, a
former vice president of maintenance and engineering at the
airline's Miami headquarters and Thomas Lewis, maintenance director
for Eastern's Northern region airports _ were indicted in July for
their alleged roles in the scheme.
   U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn told the
defendants and their lawyers to be ready for trial on Jan. 28.
   Several days after the 60-count indictment was unsealed, a
former Eastern foreman at Kennedy Airport, Elia Dragone, pleaded
guilty to conspiracy and obstructing a federal investigation into
the airline.
   He said the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors and agreed
to be a witness for the prosecution.
   The criminal indictment of Eastern was unprecedented in the
airline industry and came as the troubled airline struggled to
regain passengers, rebuild service and reorganize in bankruptcy
court after a bitter labor struggle.
   The indictment accused the airline and managers of pressuring
and intimidating employees to ``keep the aircraft in flight at all
costs.''
   Eastern has said it has ``taken full corrective action'' and
maintains that its airliners are safe.

<HEAD>Oryx Buying Out Founding Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after spending $1.21 billion to expand
internationally, Oryx Energy Co. said Tuesday it would buy out its
founding Pew family in a cash and stock deal worth about $1.4
billion.
   Oryx, using cash generated by higher oil prices, said it will
pay $53.75 per share, or $967.5 million, for 18 million shares of
common stock owned by The Glenmede Trust Co., which represents the
interests of the wealthy Philadelphia family.
   The company also will swap 7.3 million shares of preferred stock
Glenmede holds for the same number of common shares. The trust said
it will sell the stock in a public offering ``as soon as it is
practical.'' At the buyout price, the offering could bring the
trust another $392.4 million.
   As part of the deal, John G. Pew Jr. and Albert E. Piscopo,
senior vice president of the trust, have resigned as Oryx
directors, company spokesman David Clarke said. The trust's
holdings represent 27 percent of Oryx.
   Oryx shares were down 25 cents to $53.67{ in Tuesday's trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement was made after the
close of business.
   ``We entered into the transaction as a result of the difference
between Glenmede's investment objectives, including its desire for
higher current yields, and our plan to reinvest cash flow for
growth,'' said Oryx Chairman Robert P. Hauptfuhrer.
   Oryx earned $139 million last year, but said falling oil prices
in the second quarter caused it to lose $3 million in the
three-month period.
   Glenmede acts as trustee for the charitable trusts established
by the Pew family. The decision to sell out does not reflect lack
of confidence in Oryx, trust President Thomas Langfitt said.
   Until last September, Oryx was mainly a domestic producer. But
on Sept. 13, 1989, the company announced it would buy British
Petroleum Co.'s holdings in the North Sea, Indonesia, Dubai,
Ecuador, Colombia, Gabon and Italy.
   The deal, eventually valued at $1.21 billion, made Oryx the
world's largest independent oil company.
   To pay for the stock, Oryx said it had arranged for $1.8 billion
in credit to replace a $1.4 billion line. It said it would reduce
the debt within a year because of increased cash flow from higher
oil prices.
   Oil currently is trading around $30 per 42-gallon barrel,
depending on the grade, inflated by the Persian Gulf crisis. But
Hauptfuhrer said Oryx could have afforded the deal before the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Assuming a reference price of $21 per barrel, set at the July
OPEC meeting, we are confident that we can accomplish our financial
objectives,'' Hauptfuhrer said. A price would translate into about
$23 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, he said.
   ``This will enable us to continue to apply advanced
technologies, such as our horizontal drilling program, to find and
develop new reserves,'' Hauptfuhrer.
   Light sweet crude oil for October delivery settled 54 cents
lower at $30.76 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Contracts for later months were also down.
   The company has been one of the leaders in using horizontal
drilling in the Pearsall Field of South Texas, turning the
almost-played-out area into one of the hottest domestic oil plays.
   Oryx is the name taken in 1989 by Sun Exploration &amp; Production
Co. after it was spun off by the Radnor, Pa.-based Sun Co. in 1988.

<HEAD>Portman Meets Again With Creditors, Says Agreement Could Come Soon</HEAD>

   Architect-developer John C. Portman Jr. met
Wednesday with a group of creditors and his executive vice
president said afterward that an agreement could be reached within
two weeks to resolve a debt crisis.
   ``We are optimistic that we are moving forward to a conclusion,
and expect to announce in 10 days to two weeks . . . an agreement
on significant principles,'' said Sam Williams, executive vice
president of The Portman Companies.
   Portman has been meeting for more than a month with about 20
creditors to deal with debt that reportedly tops $1.6 billion.
Williams said the meetings are focusing only on unsecured debt,
which he said amounts to about 5 percent of the company's
obligations. He refused to say how much money is involved.
   Swiss Bank Corp. and CitiBank, two of the creditors
participating in the daylong meeting in Atlanta, issued a brief
statement saying that progress was made and that further sessions
will be scheduled.
   Williams declined to say exactly what was discussed at the
meeting, other than that it involved backing currently unsecured
loans with collateral.
   He maintained that the Portman organization, which has major
projects in Atlanta, New York, San Francisco, Singapore and other
cities, is solvent and in good shape.
   ``We're healthy,'' he said. ``We've been in business 30 years
and will be in business 30 more. The financing on our major
projects is firmly in place. There is no threat to the concrete and
steel buildings of the Portman Companies.''
   Williams confirmed that the Portman Organization did not make a
Sept. 1 payment to Equitable Life Assurances Society of the United
States on a $332.6 million mortgage for his flagship Peachtree
Center office complex in Atlanta. He described it as a ``technical
default done in consultation with Equitable'' but declined to
elaborate.
   Jonathan Miller, a spokesman in New York for Equitable, declined
to comment this week on the negotiations with Portman.
   Williams said Portman's current situation stems from tightened
banking regulations since the savings and loan crisis.
   ``Almost every real estate company in America will have to deal
with it,'' Williams said.
   Portman has borrowed heavily as he launched several major
projects over the last three years, including a 60-story office
tower now under construction in Atlanta.
   Williams rejected the suggestion that the debt is excessive.
   ``The permanent mortgage debt we have is not out of line with
(the projects) the company has developed and built over the
years,'' Williams said. ``The problem is trying to convert the
unsecured debt into a collateral position.''

   Steven L. Isenberg, the associate publisher
of Newsday, will join the Los Angeles Times as executive vice
president for marketing by the first of the year, the Times
announced Wednesday.
   Times Mirror Co. publishes Newsday and the Times.
   Isenberg, an Oxford and Yale educated lawyer and onetime chief
of staff to former New York Mayor John V. Lindsay, will succeed Don
Clark, 64. Clark will continue as an executive vice president
during 1991 to ensure an orderly transition, Times publisher David
Laventhol said.
   Isenberg, 49, will be responsible for advertising, circulation,
promotion and market research as well as marketing for the Times'
daily regional editions in the highly competitive Orange County,
San Fernando Valley and San Diego areas.
   Clark, who has been with the Times for 37 years, was named to
his current position in 1988. He'd worked at a number of management
positions in classified advertising before being named director of
that department in 1981.
   No successor was named to Isenberg, who has special
responsibilities for its New York Newsday editions. Newsday had a
major management restructuring last week.
