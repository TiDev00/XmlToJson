   An experiment to determine whether
dolphins can be safely returned to the open sea after years in
captivity has suffered a setback: Echo and Misha cannot be found.
   Rough waters and trouble with a coin-sized radio transmitter
have kept researchers from spotting the two male bottlenose
dolphins, who were returned to Tampa Bay on Saturday after two
years in a California research project.
   Researchers expected to spot the mammals again when the seas
become calmer, said Jay Gorzelany, a biologist at Mote Marine
Laboratory in Sarasota.
   Scientists hope the project will prove that captive animals can
be successfully released, thus reducing the perceived need to keep
dolphins in captivity permanently.
   A team of researchers who will monitor the dolphins for a year
to see how they adjust to being wild again tracked Echo and Misha
until dusk Saturday. The pair stayed close to the coast and were
once seen racing near shore with a group of wild dolphins.
   ``They were last seen near the site where they were released,''
Gorzelany said.
   Echo and Misha spent three weeks at the marine lab resting and
learning how to catch fish again before being set free in the bay.
   Researchers have been unable to locate the dolphins since then
because waves whipped up by stiff winds made it impossible to
distinguish the dolphins' dorsal fines from whitecaps on the water,
Gorzelany said.
   The team had hoped a radio transmitter placed on Echo would lead
them to the dolphins, but the device either stopped working or fell
off, Gorzelany said. However, the device was designed to fall off
after just two weeks.
   The research team will concentrate on tracking the dolphins
visually, and expect the pair to remain in the bay.
   ``The team seems pretty unconcerned,'' Gorzelany said. ``They
believe they're out there, staying together and doing fine.''

<HEAD>Court Orders ABC To Give Defense Contractor Copies of Missing
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER FULFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered ABC News to
give a military contractor copies of missing documents the
contractor says were stolen.
   The network used the documents two years ago in a news report
that suggested FMC Corp. had overcharged the Defense Department for
parts for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week upheld a lower
court ruling that Capital Cities-ABC Inc. should hand over the
documents or copies of them because they are FMC's property. FMC
said it doesn't have copies of the missing documents and needs them
for a Defense Department audit.
   ``They have something that is ours. We asked for it. They didn't
give it back. It's that simple,'' FMC attorney Joe Cari, of
Coffield Ungaretti Harris &amp; Slavin in Chicago, said Tuesday.
   Samuel Fifer, an attorney for the New York-based multi-media
company, said ABC may ask the court for a rehearing.
   ABC disagrees with the ruling because the court considered
intangible information as property, Fifer said. The broadcast
company said it has only copies of the documents, not the
originals, and thus possesses only information, not property.
   However, the appeals court noted that the since the company no
longer has the information on the documents, the copies are
``functional equivalents'' of the originals.
   In the same decision Thursday, the federal panel reversed a U.S.
District Court's decision to award the Chicago-based FMC damages.
   The company had sought unspecified damages, contending it had
suffered financially because of ABC's exposure of its military and
pricing records. FMC also has private contracts for food, machinery
and chemicals.
   ABC refused to supply the company duplicates of the documents
after they were displayed in a report on ``World News Tonight'' on
Oct. 20, 1988.
   The story indicated the defense contractor had overcharged the
government for parts. FMC disputed the report.
   The documents apparently outline the company's pricing policy,
but FMC is uncertain of their content, Cari said.
   The company realized the papers were missing after seeing the
news report and searching through its records, he said. FMC never
accused ABC of stealing the documents.
   ABC refused to hand over the four pages of documents saying it
would infringe upon its First Amendment rights, which ensure
freedom of the press.
   ``Because ABC has refused to return copies of the documents that
FMC has a right to use, ABC's retention of the documents amounts to
the exercise of unlawful dominion over them,'' the court said.
   FMC maintains it needs the documents because the Army contract
requires the company to keep complete records. The company
typically does not make copies of such documents because contracts
tend to be ``hundreds of thousands'' of pages long, Cari said.

   The government is probing an alleged plot
by cocaine traffickers to assassinate President Jaime Paz Zamora,
U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard and others, the commander of the
nation's anti-drug forces says.
   Speaking before a congressional committee on Monday, Gen. Lucio
Anez also claimed he was targeted for death as well as Interior
Minister Guillermo Capobianco and attorney Juan del Dranado, who is
representing some victims of the 1980 military coup.
   ``We are evaluating the information we have received and I do
not wish to provide any more details until investigations are
concluded,'' Annez said.
   Last month, Gelbard said U.S. officials warned him he was the
target of an assassination ordered by former Interior Minister Luis
Arce Gomez, who was extradited to Miami on drug trafficking charges
in December.
   Arce Gomez, one of the leaders of the 1980 coup, has denied the
accusation. Anez said the information about the planned killings
came from a credible source, but he would not elaborate.
   The military government lasted a year after the 1980 coup.

<BYLINE>Versace Steals The Show

<TEXT>
   Showbiz's favorite designer, Gianni Versace,
stole the show with a collection sure to put Milan back in the
fashion limelight.
   His styles for the Spring-Summer 1991 are lively, sexy, and
avant garde with an endless series of stretch pants and catsuits,
mini shift dresses, micro skirts and fiery hot pants.
   Versace also uses the most colorful palette ever to be seen on
the Milan runway, traditionally devoted to drab brown, gray and
black.
   Circus reds and blues, neon greens and yellows, disco purples
and pinks combine to create work-of-art prints which are sure to be
the talk of the town in Beverly Hills, where Versace is a household
name.
   In fact his clients include such movie and rock star notables as
Jane Fonda, Sylvester Stallone, and Elton John. Even ``Born in the
U.S.A.'' Bruce Springsteen wears Versace.
   Front-row guests at his Spring-Summer show Sunday night included
top model turned film star Carol Alt and Brazilian Formula One
racing driver Aryton Senna.
   Beyond the entertainment bent of his look, Versace has become
the trend-setter in Milan, reaching beyond the classic,
man-tailored styles which had put the Italian label at the top of
ready-to-wear, but which in recent seasons was taking a back seat
to the more creative far-out French design.
   A year ago, he shocked the fashion world by hiking the hemline
so high that panties became a hot fashion item. Versace knew that
very few would dare to wear the micro mini, but the scandalous
skirt served to secure a place for short hemlines in the next
decade.
   Sexy hip-hugging trousers, plunging necklines and flesh
revealing slits were all part of Versace's call to women to come
out of the man-tailored closet and flaunt their femininity.
   Color was another Versace innovation. Unlike most of his
colleagues who are native northern Italians, Versace grew up in sun
basked Calabria, where bright Mediterranean shades are the daily
fare.
   While everyone else was dressing women in gloomy city hues,
Versace was lighting up the runway with bright reds, blues and
greens. Sparkling sequins were another of the vivacious designer's
show-stoppers.
   On the second day of the five-day Spring-Summer 1991 collections
it was clear that the Versace message has caught on.
   Styles are short, sexy and colorful, with body-clinging stretch
outfits the favorite style. Cheerful floral and block prints
abound, and the runway sparkles in a myriad of multi-colored
sequins.
   Krizia, who showed Monday morning, abandoned her usual accordian
pleats to burst out in a series of short evening dresses in large
kaleidoscope sequined prints with matching jewelry and one-color
stretch catsuits worn under a loose floral printed silk blouse.
   Missoni, who also showed Monday morning, transposed the shades
of his famous knit prints onto a series of glittering unitards, and
floor length evening gowns.
   But the real works of art were a Versace exclusive. His prints,
all designed by the maestro, turned the runway into an art gallery
in motion, with geometric designs combining with floral patterns,
and pop-art decorations such as pictures of Hollywood myths James
Dean and Marilyn Monroe and covers of Vogue magazine.
   Some of the prints were painted onto the fabric, usually
stretch. Others were stiched in thousands of baubles and spangles.
   Everything in the collection from shoes and stockings to
necklaces, bracelets and earrings reproduced the printed motif.
   The designer, who received a standing ovation after the close of
an hour-long show, announced that proceeds from the worldwide sale
of an elegant silk shirt printed with past and present Vogue covers
will go towards AIDS research promoted by the C.F.D.A., the Council
of Fashion Designers of America.

   As Filipinos are being asked to
tighten their belts, President Corazon Aquino is preparing to move
into a multimillion- dollar office.
   Critics are calling this shameless extravagance.
   Public outrage over Mrs. Aquino's new office, a four-story
former brewery near her current office, emerged after hearings of
the Senate Finance Committee disclosed last month that the
administration was spending more than $3.2 million to refurbish the
building while the president was urging austerity in government.
   Nearly half the cost went for furnishings and another 25 percent
for security equipment, according to project manager Ernesto de
Castro.
   ``The timing of the construction of such a building is very bad
especially with a public perception that the executive branch is
extravagant,'' said opposition Rep. Salvador Escudero.
   The project also has caught on as a public issue because it
contrasts so sharply with Mrs. Aquino's early efforts to distance
herself from the style and excesses of her ousted predecessor,
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Since assuming the presidency in February 1986, she had kept her
office at the presidential Guest House to show she was but a
``transient'' in the nation's highest office.
   She transformed Marcos' phrey running and will move
within 60 minutes.

<HEAD>Snow in the 80s: Just Melting Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The northern half of the planet seems to be
losing its snowy blanket, but researchers are reluctant to say why
or predict whether the meltdown will continue.
   The area covered by snow was less in 1988 and 1989 than at any
time in the nearly 20 years that records have been kept,
researchers report.
   Low snow cover has continued this year, David A. Robinson of
Rutgers University said Monday.
   Robinson and Kenneth F. Dewey of the University of Nebraska
analyzed snow cover records in a report in the journal Geophysical
Research Letters, published by the American Geophysical Union.
   ``Northern Hemisphere snow cover during 1988 and 1989 was at its
lowest extent since the advent of reliable satellite snow cover
monitoring in 1972, running some 8 percent to 10 percent below''
average, they said.
   But Robinson was not ready to blame the widely reported threat
of global warming for the disappearance of the snow.
   ``That doesn't mean we're in a greenhouse warming,'' he said.
``It could totally turn around in the next decade, or it could be
an early sign of global warming, but it's too early to tell with
just a 20-year record.''
   It could be that global warming causes the snow to melt. But it
also could be that melting snow exposes more ground, which absorbs
more heat from the sun, and that causes more warming.
   ``We're starting to look at it on a regional basis to get a
handle on it, but it's premature to ascribe it to a chicken or egg.
In the long run I'll bet it turns out to be a little of both,''
Robinson said.
   The theory of greenhouse warming predicts that precipitation
will increase in polar regions. If this occurs, the snowpack could
increase again, resulting in a cooling in those areas.
   The greenhouse theory contends that carbon dioxide and other
chemicals released into the atmosphere by human activities could
trap heat from the sun and warm the Earth in somewhat the way a
greenhouse traps heat.
   The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased
significantly over the last century. However, scientists disagree
over whether any warming has actually occurred during that period.
   Snow cover information is collected by satellites operated by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   NOAA researcher Chet Ropelewski has reported that snow cover in
the Northern Hemisphere in June and July was the lowest on record,
at about 57 percent of normal in North America and 40 percent over
Eurasia.
   In June, for example, about 1.35 million square miles of North
America had a covering of snow. In a normal June, 2.47 million
square miles would be snow-covered.
   While month-to-month variation is understandable, the periods
with highest snow cover tended to occur in the 1970s, with a marked
decline in the 1980s.
   Maximum Northern Hemisphere snow cover during the period of
record was in February 1978, at 20.4 million square miles. The
minimum was in August 1989, at 1 million square miles.

   The hospital director in east Jerusalem tried
to calm thousands of anxious Palestinians, some weeping and others
vowing revenge, as he pushed his way to the emergency ward.
   ``It's manslaughter,'' he told reporters.
   Some of the Palestinians at Mukassed Hospital on Monday were
mourning relatives killed when police fired on Arab rioters in
Jerusalem's Old City. Others shook with fear over the fate of
missing children or husbands.
   Youths, some wearing masks, waved outlawed Palestinian flags and
shouted for retaliation.
   A chant went up from a group of grieving women: ``Bring Bush!
Bring Bush!'' They wanted President Bush, leader of Israel's
staunchest ally, to see for himself the aftermath of Monday's
bloody confrontation.
   Arab ambulances arrived from all over the occupied West Bank,
sirens screaming. They ferried victims from Temple Mount in the Old
City to Mukassed and nearby Augusta Victoria, the main hospitals in
Arab east Jerusalem.
   Israeli police opened fire with tear gas and bullets on the
Temple Mount, site of one of Islam's most sacred shrines, after
Moslems pelted Jewish worshipers with rocks at the adjacent Wailing
Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   Scattered shooting incidents followed in the Old City.
   Hospital officials said at least 19 Palestinians were killed and
140 wounded, many with live ammunition.
   Adnan Hamad, the administrative director of Mukassed, called it
``manslaughter'' when he spoke to reporters. He tried his best to
comfort 3,000 to 4,000 anxious people.
   Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner said the incident ``started
with a major riot, which was dangerous.''
   Still, he said, he felt compassion for the families at Mukassed.
   ``Families of the dead and wounded ... I can understand their
pain,'' Terner told Israel radio.
   Mukassad had been thrust right into the violence. At one point,
paramilitary border police fired tear gas inside the hospital,
apparently to stop Palestinians outside from pushing their way in.
   Babies coughing from tear gas were passed through hospital
windows to people outside to get them away from the fumes.
   Hospital officials called a fire truck to bring fans and other
equipment to clear the gas from areas housing patients.
   Mukassed was so overwhelmed with casualties that 11 elderly
women overcome by tear gas were treated with oxygen in the
hospital's mosque and library.
   In the hospital morgue, seven dead Palestinians lay on slabs.
All appeared to be in their 20s. One had half his head shot away.
   Blood spattered walls and floors. It soaked the bedding on
stretchers.
   Police blocked most private cars from reaching the hospital but
let U.N. buses pass. They carried Palestinians who had volunteered
to donate blood.
   Among the officials who rushed to the hospital was Hashem
Mahamid, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament.
   He later told Israel radio that the tear gas firing ``was a very
brutal act.''
   At Augusta Victoria Hospital, Khaled Shalatef, of the West Bank
town of Ramallah, was treated for head and eye wounds from rubber
bullets.
   ``We are Moslems, and we came to defend our mosque,'' said the
26-year-old. The Palestinians had begun stoning the Jews at the
Wailing Wall after rumors spread that Jewish extremists planned to
march on the Temple Mount.
   ``I did not expect Jews to perform such terrible massacres
against unarmed people,'' Shalatef said.

<HEAD>Livestock Output Up Modestly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A modest increase in livestock output is under
way, and Agriculture Department economists say it could take some
of the upward pressure from retail meat prices in 1991.
   Early projections by the department's Economic Research Service
point to 1991 gains in beef production, up 1 percent from this
year; pork, 3 percent; and broilers and turkeys, about 5 percent.
   A major reason for the stepped-up livestock production is the
bumper harvest of corn and other crops this fall, which has helped
reduce feed costs. Improved grazing has helped, too.
   For example, range and wheat pasture conditions a year ago
deteriorated in many areas, pushing larger number of lighter-weight
cattle into feedlots.
   ``This pattern is not likely to be repeated this fall unless
forage conditions deteriorate,'' the report said. ``Recent rains
have further improved prospects for fall grazing.''
   Prices of stocker and feeder cattle are expected to ``remain
well above a year ago'' this fall, it said, and with strong demand
for lighter-weight animals to put on pastures, fewer will be moving
into feedlots.
   Market prices of Choice-grade steers averaged about $77 per 100
pounds in the first two weeks of September but have been declining
seasonally, the report said. One factor has been the record weights
of cattle going to slaughter.
   Some of that extra weight - translated into more beef - has been
due to producers holding back cattle because of the uncertainty
over the federal budget and the possibility of a furlough of meat
inspectors. Plants would have had to cease operations on days
inspectors didn't work.
   ``However, as feedlot marketings become more current (meaning
lighter cattle weights) and beef supplies tighten in the late fall
and early winter, fed steer prices are expected to strengthen into
the upper $70s per hundredweight,'' the report said.
   But seasonally larger pork supplies and record poultry
production probably ``will compete aggressively'' with beef at
retail counters, it said. That will dampen further price increases
in the coming months.
   Beef output in 1991 is forecast to rise about 1 percent from
this year, with all of the increase coming from fed cattle.
   ``Hog producers are expected to cautiously expand breeding herds
this year and in early 1991, despite generally favorable net
returns through midsummer,'' the report said. ``A sharp drop in hog
prices late this summer clouded the long-term profit outlook.''
   Even so, based on surveys of producer intentions and historical
trends, it appears hog production in the first half of 1991 may
rise about 2 percent from a year earlier. Production in the second
half could be up 4 percent from the year-earlier mark.
   Hog prices at the major markets may average ``in the high $40s
to low $50s per hundredweight in 1991,'' the report said. That
would compare with the mid-$50s expected as this year's average.
   Overall, commercial pork production next year is projected to
increase about 3 percent from this year. And that means retail
prices ``are expected to decline slightly from this year's
record,'' the report said.
   Looking at broilers, the report said production will continue
growing in 1991 but at a slightly slower pace, perhaps 5 percent to
6 percent above this year's level.
   Wholesale broiler prices for all of 1990 probably will average
54 to 56 cents per pound, and the continued increase in production
is expected to cause prices to slip slightly in 1991.
   Retail prices for whole fryers in the second half of 1990 are
expected to average 85 to 90 cents per pound, down 5 percent to 6
percent from last year.
   Turkey production is expected to gain only 5 percent in 1991,
about half this year's sharp increase, the report said. The
prospective slowdown was attributed to ``this year's low producer
returns.''
   ``Red meat prices, particularly for pork, will, as usual, play a
key role in fourth-quarter turkey prices,'' the report said.
   For all of 1990, consumer turkey prices are expected to average
99 cents to $1.02 per pound, about the same as last year. Little
change is expected in 1991 at the retail level.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Meeting Reveals No New Allegations Against McCain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A closed-door Senate Ethics Committee meeting
last week revealed no new information to challenge a recommendation
that Sen. John McCain be dropped from a savings and loan
investigation, a congressional source says.
   McCain, of Arizona, is the only Republican among five senators
under investigation for their ties to a major political donor,
former thrift owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
   McCain is pressing hard for a committee decision, before
Congress adjourns later this month, to adopt a special counsel's
recommendation to end the case against him.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who also met privately with the
committee last week, is pushing just as hard for dismissal of his
case. Special counsel Robert S. Bennett also recommended dismissal
of the case against Glenn.
   Bennett proposed that the investigation be expanded against
Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan.
   The congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that the committee's questioning of
McCain covered the same facts that led to the dismissal
recommendation.
   The source said if any new allegations against McCain had
surfaced, they likely would have been raised at last week's closed
testimony, when Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. did most
of the questioning.
   McCain and the four other senators intervened with U.S. banking
regulators as Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan was heading toward
failure. The federal government seized the Irvine, Calif.-based
institution in April 1989, and it could cost taxpayers $2 billion
to cover its losses.
   The source familiar with McCain's appearance said the questions
dealt with two crucial meetings McCain and his colleagues held with
banking regulators on Keating's behalf, and trips the senator took
on Keating's airplanes. Also discussed were an investment by
McCain's wife in a Keating shopping center and even McCain's
philosophy on what constitutes proper behavior for a senator.
McCain has given public explanations of these same matters.
   McCain received $112,000 from Keating and associates for his
campaigns, some of it donated before Keating bought the Irvine,
Calif.-based Lincoln.
   The congressional source said McCain was pressed on why he
joined Cranston, DeConcini and Glenn in meeting with top S&amp;L
regulator Edwin J. Gray on Keating's behalf April 2, 1987. McCain
had told the panel that only a week earlier, he threw Keating out
of his office - and ended their personal friendship - after
refusing to negotiate with regulators for Lincoln's owner.
   McCain told regulators, the source said, that he had an
obligation to make sure a major Arizona employer was treated fairly
after Keating complained the regulators were dragging out their
examination of Lincoln. Lincoln's parent company, American
Continental Corp., was based in Phoenix.
   When asked what constituted proper behavior for a senator in a
case like this one, McCain said it was his role to see that a
constituent is treated fairly by regulators. But he said
negotiating for the constituent would be improper, the source
commented.
   McCain, according to the source, cited to the committee his
comments on this theme in an April 9, 1987, meeting that all five
senators had with the regulators who were examining Lincoln.
   In a transcript made by one of the regulators, McCain said, ``I
wouldn't want any special favors'' for Lincoln and, ``I don't want
any part of our conversation to be improper.''
   McCain was asked, the source said, about vacation flights he and
his family took to the Bahamas from 1984 through 1986 in Keating's
corporate and chartered airplanes.
   McCain paid $13,433 to Keating's company in 1989 for the trips,
which were taken when the senator was a member of the House and
were not mentioned on his financial disclosure forms.
   McCain cited to the committee its own letter saying the trips
were a matter for the House, and a House ethics panel letter saying
the payments ended the matter.
   McCain said the investment by his wife and father-in-law in a
Keating shopping center partnership was proper because he was not
involved and did not benefit from the deal.

<HEAD>Governor Says He's Not Worried About Possible Challenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer says he is not worried
about a possible re-election challenge from ex-Ku Klux Klan leader
David Duke.
   Roemer said Monday that the race by Duke against U.S. Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston showed that voters have ``a lot of anger and
anxiety ... against the federal government.'' He said the people
think the government is not responsive on energy policy and
balancing the budget.
   Running as a maverick Republican, Duke picked up 44 percent of
the vote in Saturday's primary against Johnston, a Democrat.
   ``He lost, as he does most races. Maybe he can change,'' Roemer
said of Duke.
   Duke, a first-term member of the Louisiana House, says he will
decide in the coming weeks on a 1991 governor's race. Duke noted
that he received a larger percentage of the vote than Roemer did in
1987.

<HEAD>Martinez Proposes 12-Year Limit on Legislative Terms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez is proposing limiting
lawmakers to 12 years in office and sharply curbing gifts to public
officials.
   In a series of campaign stops, the Republican governor said
Monday that if re-elected he would push for the limit in a
constitutional amendment that would be placed on the 1992 ballot
for voters to decide.
   The proposal also would limit Cabinet members to a pair of
four-year terms, the same restriction now placed on the governor.
   Voters in Oklahoma approved such a limit earlier this year, and
similar measures will appear on ballots in California, Colorado and
Missouri next month. The measures are seen as examples of voters'
growing dissatisfaction with incumbents.
   The governor's proposed legislation to curtail the gifts and
travel lavished on public officials comes amid an investigation by
State Attorney Willie Meggs of Tallahassee into whether lawmakers
properly disclosed what they've received from lobbyists over the
past five years. Records of both lobbyists and legislators have
been subpoenaed. Martinez is running against former U.S. Sen.
Lawton Chiles.

   Four legislators indicted as a result of
the FBI's probe into a cash-for-votes scandal at the Statehouse
remain candidates in the Nov. 6 election.
   Democratic state Reps. Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding, B.J. Gordon
and Luther Taylor have been indicted on charges that they accepted
cash for their support of a parimutuel betting bill.
   Having recently been arraigned on the charges, they are seeking
re-election and remain on the November ballot, said Betsy DuRant,
executive director of the state Democratic Party. None has
opposition.
   Six other legislators who have been indicted either have
withdrawn their candidacies or resigned without seeking
re-election.
   State election officials said an indictment doesn't disqualify a
candidate for office, and the legislators are innocent until proven
guilty.
   The charges came after the FBI used lobbyist Ron Cobb to pay
cash bribes to lawmakers.

   The killings of at least 19 Palestinians
by Israeli police set off a barrage of Arab warnings and threats.
   Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party said today that the
``crime'' would lead Arabs to the ``liberation of Jerusalem and all
other (Moslem) holy places,'' a reference to Saudi Arabia, where
U.S.-led military forces massed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, criticized by Iraq and its
friends for joining the U.S.-led force, warned that Monday's
bloodbath at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem could lead to ``grave
consequences'' in the Middle East.
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council delayed action Monday
night on an Arab-backed resolution to condemn the killings as a
``criminal act.'' The United States was resisting the proposal, and
Israel rejected outright its provision for a three-member U.N.
mission to investigate the killings.
   Israeli police opened fire on stone-throwing Palestinians on the
Temple Mount, a site holy to both Moslems and Jews, in the
bloodiest incident in Jerusalem since Israel seized its Arab sector
from Jordan in 1967.
   Israeli Police Minister Roni Milo said 19 people died and 140
were wounded. Police moved in after Arabs began stoning Jewish
worshipers at Judaism's holiest site, the Wailing Wall, which is
located on one side of the Temple Mount. Twenty-two people, most of
them worshipers at the wall, also suffered minor injuries.
   The clash was touched off by rumors that Jewish fundamentalists
were planning to defile the al-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount, Islam's
third holiest site.
   In the shantytown Palestinian camps around the Jordanian capital
of Amman, hundreds of young men waved Palestinian flags and black
banners shortly after the bloodshed.
   Mohammed Milhem, a member of the PLO's ruling 15-man Executive
Committee, warned that Palestinians might start using weapons in
the 34-month-old uprising in the occupied lands.
   ``The massacre heralds a new stage for the intefadeh,'' he said.
   An editorial published today in Al-Thawra, the official
publication of Iraq's Baath Party, said Monday's deaths ``will not
go without retaliation, and the Arab nation is certainly capable to
retaliate and it will.''
   ``It will turn into a massive wave of indignation, which will
take the pan-Arab struggle into a step toward the liberation of
Jerusalem and all other holy places and claim the Arab homeland
from treachery and occupation,'' the editorial said.
   Iraqi leaders and many Moslems have denounced the foreign
presence on Saudi soil, which they claim is a desecration of
Islam's two holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   Al-Thawra's editorial also criticized Saudi Arabia's King Fahd
and Mubarak, saying Arab indignation over the Palestinian deaths
``will sweep them away, even if they issue verbal condemnations of
the crime.''
   A statement issued by Mubarak's office Monday night said
Israel's ``savage repressive measures exceeded all limits'' and
added that the Jewish state is ``fully responsible'' for protecting
Islamic shrines in Jerusalem.
   In Jordan, where Palestinians comprise more than half the
population of 3.5 million, the foreign ministry called on the
international community to intervene quickly ``to halt these
inhumane practices and protect the Palestinian population.''

<HEAD>Utah Ex-Governor's Son Suspects A-Bomb Test Fallout in Cancer
Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The son of former Gov. Scott M. Matheson
believes the open-air atomic testing whose dangers his father
fought to expose caused the cancer that killed him.
   Matheson died Sunday at age 61 of multiple myeloma. He lived in
Cedar City in the early 1950s when the government conducted dozens
of above-ground tests 300 miles away in Nevada that caused
radioactive fallout to drift into Utah.
   As governor from 1977 to 1985, Matheson fought to expose the
dangers of those tests and gain compensation for radiation victims
- an effort that succeeded with the passage by Congress last week
of a compensation bill.
   Scott M. Matheson Jr. said Monday his father found it an
``interesting wrinkle'' that he was diagnosed with a disease that
Congress recognized as having possible links to atomic fallout.
   ``When the doctors diagnosed him, they asked whether he'd spent
any time in southern Utah. The reason was in connection with the
testing,'' Matheson said.
   Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood-producing bone marrow
and has been recognized as a malignancy that can be caused by
radiation.
   ``While it's speculation to say anything conclusive about the
cause, it is noteworthy ... and it adds some cruel irony to the
sequence of events as they unfolded for him,'' he said.
   From 1952 to 1954, Matheson was a deputy Iron County attorney in
Cedar City. From 1951 to 1958, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
set off more than 100 atomic bombs at the Nevada Test Site.
   ``Those were some of the heaviest years of (open air) testing, I
believe,'' Matheson said. ``And we were there.''
   Numerous relatives and family friends from that part of the
state have also died of cancer, he said.
   The 1963 Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty outlawed atomic tests in the
atmosphere and under water, permitting only underground explosions.
   Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens co-sponsored the compensation bill
with Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch.
   Matheson ``was a champion of that cause,'' Owens said. ``He
testified in favor of legislation of the kind we ultimately passed,
not knowing that it would have anything to do with him.''
   The bill provides for payment of up to $50,000 to fallout
victims or their heirs and lists specific disease and residency
requirements. Victims also are to receive a formal apology from the
government.
   The Justice Department has complained that the measure could
leave the government open to further liability and opposed its
passage. President Bush has said he will let the bill become law
withot his signature.
   The bill followed an unsuccessful attempt by so-called
``downwinders'' to gain compensation through a class-action lawsuit
in the early 1980s. A federal judge found in favor of the victims,
but the ruling was overturned by an appeals court.
   Matheson said the family has not discussed whether it will apply
for the compensation.

   The karate film ``Marked for Death'' topped
weekend box office sales, while curious moviegoers also flocked to
see ``Henry &amp; June,'' the first movie to carry the new adult
rating.
   The controversy over the new NC-17 rating prompted sellout
crowds for Universal's ``Henry &amp; June,'' which took in $868,000 in
only 76 theaters for a robust $11,427 per-screen average.
   The movie chronicling the affairs of Anais Nin with Henry Miller
and his wife is the first released under the Motion Picture
Association of America's new rating. The NC-17 excludes anyone
under 17 and replaces the X-rating.
   ``Marked for Death,'' starring Steven Seagal took in $10.5
million to finish first in the weekend box-office ratings,
according to figures released Monday.
   Disney's re-release of its half-century-old cartoon classic
``Fantasia'' came in second with $5.2 million, followed by the
yuppie tenant nightmare ``Pacific Heights'' with $5.1 million.
   The supernatural love story ``Ghost'' was fourth with $4.7
million, and the mob film ``GoodFellas'' was fifth with $4.5
million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Marked for Death,'' 20th Century Fox, $10.5 million, 1,968
screens, $5,344 per screen, $10.5 million, one week.
   2. ``Fantasia,'' Disney, $5.2 million, 461 screens, $11,280 per
screen, $5.2 million (1990), one week (1990).
   3. ``Pacific Heights,'' 20th Century Fox, $5.1 million, 1,283
screens, $3,953 per screen, $14 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $4.7 million, 1,766 screens, $2,664 per
screen, $161.5 million, 13 weeks.
   5. ``GoodFellas,'' Warner Bros., $4.5 million, 1,328 screens,

<HEAD>Black Leaders Hope to Revive Plan to Carve New City Out of Part of
Boston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After failing twice at the polls, community
activists will try a different tack next month in their goal to
secede from Boston and create a new city named for black South
African leader Nelson Mandela.
   Non-binding referendums in support of carving out a city from
Boston's predominantly black inner-city neighborhoods failed by
wide margins in 1986 and 1988.
   But during the next election, on Nov. 6, residents of just one
inner-city legislative district will be asked whether they would
like to see a study on the financial feasibility of creating a new
city.
   If that non-binding referendum is approved, it could be used as
a lobbying tool to get the Legislature to endorse the study, said
Sadiki Kambon, chairman of Project FATE, or Focusing Attitudes
Toward Empowerment.
   The next goal would be a binding referendum on the feasibility
study in 1992, which could lead to another vote on the secession
question in 1994, Kambon said.
   Approximately 126,000 of the city's 563,000 residents are black,
and many live in the inner-city area, which some black leaders say
has been allowed to decay over the years. To revive it, they say
they must create their own city and take charge of their own
destiny.
   ``Because we don't have any control, our community is dying,''
said Andrew Jones, a founder of the secession movement.
   But Lee Jackson, Boston's treasurer, says a new city would start
out in worse financial shape than inner-city Boston, which he said
benefits from the city's ``healthy downtown tax base.''
   ``You'd start with a city that would immediately have a huge
deficit and be hoping the state would bail it out,'' Jackson said.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn has also opposed proposals to create a
separate city, saying it would segregate the community. Some black
leaders have also opposed the effort on the grounds that the city
could not survive without Boston's tax base.
   But Kambon said the feasibility study would end questions about
whether such a city could function. He added that he hoped the
study would also show resources were available to support the city.

   Their boats are cardboard, their
coveted trophy is a pink flamingo and their annual regatta is held
in a corn field.
   Bolingbrook Yacht Club members say they have just about
everything discriminating mariners could want - except water.
   With Lake Michigan some 30 miles away, residents of this Chicago
suburb have formed a unique version of one of the lakeside city's
most elite cliques.
   ``You make do with what you have,'' said Commodore Dennis Scott,
head of the club jokingly named ``Bolingbrook by the Sea.''
   The club was founded 10 years ago by residents of this
landlocked one-time farm community who wanted to shake the town's
rube reputation.
   ``We went out and bought sails, some kazoos and other things we
thought a yacht club should have,'' said founding father Terrence
Little.
   ``And we got an official song. You may know it: `By the sea, by
the sea, by the Bolingbrook sea ...'''
   In their annual ``regatta,'' Bolingbrook yachtsmen run, cheat
and bribe their way through an obstacle course in a corn field,
though the event also can be held on the Village Hall lawn.
   ``Bolingbrook should be proud,'' Scott said. ``We are the
originators of the sport and the largest corn field society in the
world.''

   The Temple Mount is like a vast ammunition
depot of emotions that can be set off by the smallest provocation.
   Both Moslems and Jews claim it as the symbol of their religious
and national aspirations. Its graceful domed mosques and
honey-colored Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, have long been a fault
line in the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially in the 34-month
Palestinian uprising.
   The 35-acre platform is venerated by the Jews as the site of
their two biblical temples. The temples' only remainder, the
Western Wall lining one side of the platform, is Judaism's holiest
site.
   The Moslems, who call the compound Haram es-Sharif, or ``Noble
Enclosure,'' believe it is the place where the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven on a white stallion.
   The tree-lined Temple Mount, site of the Al Aqsa mosque and
gold-roofed Dome of the Rock, is Islam's third holiest site after
Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   When Israel captured the Old City and surrounding Arab east
Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, it allowed Moslems to retain
control of Haram es-Sharif.
   But Moslems are suspicious that Israel and the Jews want to
destroy the mosques and build the Third Jewish Temple in their
place.
   Fears are fueled by the Temple Mount Faithful and other
nationalist Jewish groups who demand that Israel take control over
the platform to restore Jewish greatness.
   On Monday, tension heightened when the Temple Mount Faithful
announced plans to lay the cornerstone for the Third Temple before
being blocked by police.
   Successive Israeli governments have barred Jews from praying on
the Temple Mount, except in small groups, for fear of clashes with
Moslems. In addition, a rabbinical ruling says Jews must keep out
lest they tread holy ground.
   But the Temple Mount Faithful, once considered a fringe group,
is winning more and more support in the right-wing government of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Science Minister Yuval Neeman of the ultra-rightist Tehihya
Party on Monday denounced what he called Israel's ``policy of
weakness'' and demanded that Jews take control of the Temple Mount.
   Israelis claim that Palestinian militants take cover behind
their holy places to stage anti-Israeli violence. Palestinians see
the Haram es-Sharif as the symbol and center of their would-be
Palestinian state.
   During the early months of the Palestinian uprising, hundreds of
masked youths staged weekly demonstrations after Friday noon
prayers, hurling stones at border police and raising outlawed
Palestinian flags.
   On July 3, 1988, Moslem preachers used mosque loudspeakers to
call Palestinians to the ``defense'' of Haram es-Sharif, saying the
Israelis planned to dig a tunnel to the shrine.
   Hundreds of Palestinians responded, hurling stones at police. It
turned out that the tunnel was part of an archaeological dig along
the Western Wall.

   The blue-eyed ballboy chewing a wad of gum in
the Pittsburgh Pirates' dugout is not overawed that his team has
reached the National League baseball playoffs.
   Angelo Donatelli was in the Pirates' dugout when Bill Mazeroski
hit the home run that won the 1960 World Series. With the exception
of relief pitcher Ted Powers, none of the players on the Pirates'
roster was born when Donatelli started the job 35 years ago.
   Now white-haired and 63 years old, Donatelli is keeping his
fingers crossed he can watch another World Series from his vantage
point on the bench.
   It's his job to monitor the number of balls that go into the
stands during a game and to keep the umpire supplied with
replacements.
   ``I just sit here and I notice when a ball goes into the
stands,'' Donatelli said. ``Then I take one out and set it beside

<HEAD>Residents of Quiet Suburb Try to Put Bloody Slayings Behind Them</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Customers at the Lakeside Coffee House in
this affluent Chicago suburb would rather talk about baseball, not
murder.
   Three days after a high school senior was arrested in connection
with the slayings of a couple and their unborn child, residents of
this city of million-dollar homes and sprawling estates were
philosophical Monday.
   ``If someone gets shot, it happens. It's sad, but it happens all
over. Just because it happened here doesn't make much difference,''
said Paola Nilsson, a waitress at the coffee shop where several
residents gathered Monday to watch the National League playoffs.
   But the arrest of David Biro, 17, of Winnetka, did rekindle some
fears first ignited when the bloody slayings of Richard Langert and
his pregnant wife, Nancy, occurred last April. The couple were
gunned down in the basement of their townhouse.
   It also brought to mind a shooting rampage in 1988 that
shattered this quiet community of 13,000, which has seen only four
murders in its history.
   Two years ago, Laurie Dann entered a Winnetka elementary school
and shot six children, killing one. Then she fled and barricaded
herself in a nearby house, shooting a college student before
killing herself.
   ``People keep it in the back of their minds,'' Loretta Purcell
said as she watched the baseball game from the coffee shop counter.
   ``You had Laurie Dann; now you've got this,'' she said. ``What's
going to happen next? You look behind you when you walk down a back
street. I tell my nieces when they're home alone, even in the
daytime, don't answer the door.''
   Until Biro's arrest, the case had baffled police, in part
because more than $500 remained untouched in Mrs. Langert's purse.
Police had tracked one dead-end lead after another, one leading as
far as Northern Ireland and the Irish Republican Army.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday that Biro was arrested
after he allegedly told another youth details of the crime that had
not been disclosed publicly. Police have refused to confirm that
report, but they have said Biro and the victims knew each other.
   Talk among many residents turned to Biro on Monday. Some
described him as a lonely person who ran twice for class president
of New Trier High School just to attract attention.
   ``He was always, like, `Look at me,' '' said Nilsson, 16, who
spent one year at New Trier.
   ``I'd see him walking around town in an overcoat and a fedora.
He was a strange bird,'' said Steve Szczepaniak, 19, who graduated
from New Trier last year.

<HEAD>Bush's Approval Rating Drops Amid Dissatisfaction With Budget
Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new polls show President Bush's approval
ratings remain high even though they have dropped to the lowest
point of the year.
   An ABC-Washington Post poll conducted Thursday through Saturday
and released Monday showed 65 percent approving the way Bush is
handling his job, down from 75 percent a month earlier and equal to
the 65 percent recorded in July. That 65 percent was the lowest
approval rating since Bush took office.
   A CBS-New York Times poll conducted Sunday gave Bush an approval
rating of 62 percent, down from a peak of 76 percent in August just
after troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.
   Congress fared little better:
   -In the ABC-Washington Post poll, 57 percent said Congress was
more to blame than the president for the budget impasse.
   -In the CBS-New York Times poll, 54 percent blamed the budget
snarl on Congress and the president equally.
   The ABC-Washington Post poll interviewed 775 people and the
CBS-New York Times poll interviewed 756. Both surveys were done by
telephone and reported a likely margin of error of 4 percentage
points either way.

<HEAD>Striped Bass Ban Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHNGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fishing for Atlantic striped bass will be
prohibited in most federal waters starting Nov. 1, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced.
   Harvest and possession of striped bass will be banned in federal
waters extending from 3 miles to 200 miles off shore. The only
exception is an area of Block Island Sound, Rhode Island, where
fishermen will be permitted to transport to the mainland bass taken
legally in state waters at Block Island.
   The regulations are intended to protect the striped bass, which
is slowly recovering from a severe decline in the 1970s and early
1980s, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service said.
   Taking of striped bass in state waters is subject to varying
regulation.

<HEAD>Group Gearing Up to Send Christmas Gifts to Gulf GIs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization that sent $3 million worth of
gift packages to servicemen in Vietnam is gearing up to ship
Christmas packages to U.S. soldiers in the Persian Gulf region.
   Roger Chapin, president of Help Hospitalized Veterans, said his
goal is to raise enough money to send 250,000 packages, enough for
every American serving in Operation Desert Shield to receive one.
   Chapin said each of the packages will have a retail value of at
least $15, including packaging and shipping, and will contain nuts,
cookies, dates, raisins, hard candies and other treats.
   Each package will include a Christmas card from the donor, along
with a card the recipient can mail back.
   Chapin said the cost to the donor for one package would be $15.
Two can be sponsored for $25, four for $50, six for $75 and eight
for $100.
   People wishing to donate may call 1-800-755-GIFT (or
1-800-755-4438) from Oct. 14 to Nov. l5, or may send a check or
money order to ``G.I. Christmas Gift Pac'' at P.O. Box 91560,
Washington, D.C. 20090.
   Help Hospitalized Veterans is an offshoot of Vietnam Gift Pac,
which Chapin, a former San Diego real estate developer, founded in
1967 after a chance meeting with a Navy corpsman wounded in
Vietnam.
   Chapin, an Army veteran, founded Help Hospitalized Veterans in
1970. The non-profit organization provides hospitalized veterans
with arts and crafts kits.
   In a related development, the Postal Service urged Americans
mailing Christmas gifts to service personnel in the gulf region to
mail early.
   The Postal Service said that to ensure timely delivery to the
Middle East, air parcels should be mailed by Nov. 16, letters and
cards by Nov. 26, parcel airlift mail by Nov. 10 and
space-available mail by Nov. 3.

<HEAD>Congress Passes Deficit-Reduction Plan; Government Shutdown
Averted</HEAD>

   A government shutdown ended early Tuesday
after a night of budget breakthroughs in Congress that also saw the
Senate give final approval to a $500-billion deficit-reduction
plan.
   The Senate passed an emergency bill on a voice vote Monday night
that would let the government open normally Tuesday morning and the
House concurred, 362-3, at about 1:30 a.m. EDT.
   The White House said President Bush would sign the legislation
and that all federal employees should report to work as scheduled.
   Shortly after midnight, the Senate voted 66-33 for final
approval to a separate measure, a five-year, $500-billion package
of tax increases and spending cuts. The plan envisioned smaller
cuts in Medicare, but possibly higher tax increases, than an
earlier version the House rejected last week.
   ``Tonight we reap the bitter harvest of a decade of national
indulgence,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Majorities of both parties voted for the budget plan. Democrats
favored it 42-13, and Republicans voted for it by a 24-20 margin.
   This outline plan mapped the way for specific spending cuts and
tax increases, which Congress planned to put in a separate bill and
pass by Oct. 19. The outline does not require the president's
signature, but the later bill does.
   The emergency spending measure would allow the government to
operate normally through Oct. 19. Congressional leaders hope all
budget work will be completed by then, and that the members can
adjourn to work on their re-election campaigns.
   ``The president will sign the continuing resolution (the
emergency bill) this morning. The government can resume operations.
All federal employees should report to work this morning,'' White
House spokeswoman Laura Melillo said after the House gave its final
approval.
   The Statue of Liberty, museums and national parks have been
closed since Saturday because the budget crisis had prevented
Congress from approving any spending legislation for the new fiscal
year. But the full brunt of the federal shutdown was masked because
of the long Columbus Day weekend.
   Earlier in the day, lawmakers warned of chaos if the White House
and Congress failed to resolve their months-long impasse over the
federal deficit.
   ``We're not just dealing with programs,'' warned Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, urging his colleagues to pass the
measure quickly. ``We're dealing with individual human beings and
families, and their hopes and fears and dreams.''
   ``This has just een playing marshmallow stuff'' so far, said
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's assistant Republican
leader, referring to the limited impact on the government during
the Columbus Day holiday weekend.
   ``Any thoughtful, reasonable person now knows what happens to
this government tomorrow.''
   Debate on the budget began in the early evening. Leaders of both
parties had spent the day trying to line up support for the budget
and for a separate measure bringing the shut-down government back
to life Tuesday morning.
   ``This is not a shining moment for anyone,'' Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said of the budget mess
as debate began. ``And frankly, our countrymen are rightly tired of
it.''
   The House passed the budget outline 250-164 in a post-midnight
session early Monday. The measure contains far fewer specific
spending cuts and tax increases than the version that went down to
defeat last week, putting off those decisions for later in the
month.
   The vagueness of the new package left some senators unhappy.
   ``I'm not going to sign onto this fill-in-the-blanks package,''
said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who supported and helped write the
first package.
   Sasser said of the new proposal, ``The best argument is it
reduces the deficit by historic proportions over the next five
years and gives Congress flexibility on issues and problems that
have troubled members and constituents over the last few days.''
   Many lawmakers of both parties believe that in the end the new
plan will also contain a cut in the capital gains tax rate and
higher income taxes for the wealthy. Bush has wanted to slash the
capital gains tax - levied on sales of property - for years, while
Democrats have demanded the higher rates on the wealthy as a
tradeoff.
   The new proposal would eliminate many of the specifics from
savings proposals that had driven a majority of both Democrats and
Republicans to reject an initial package Friday in the House.
   Gone was one-third of the earlier plan's $60 billion in Medicare
reductions - including higher costs and lower benefits for
beneficiaries. Specifics on higher taxes for gasoline, home-heating
oil, alcohol, tobacco and other items were also deleted.
   Instead, the new version would pare Medicare savings to $40
billion. New taxes over the five years could total $10 billion more
than the $135 billion in the old package, but all decisions about
specific spending cuts and tax boosts were to be left to Congress'
committees.
   This approach worked in the House, which approved the new plan
despite opposition from most minority Republicans.
   Like the rejected package, the new plan claims to save $40
billion in the fiscal year that started Oct. 1, and $500 billion
over the next five years.
   House Democratic leaders told their rank-and-file that under the
new plan, the Medicare deductible paid by recipients for doctors'
costs would rise gradually from $75 to $100, instead of the $150 in
the old package.
   The House also approved the temporary spending bill 305-105
early Monday.
   Without Senate approval and Bush's signature on that measure,
all but crucial government services would shut down Tuesday, and
hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be sent home.
   Over the three-day weekend, the effects of the government's
legal inability to spend money have been spotty.
   Essential services such as air traffic control and federal
prisons functioned normally, but the Statue of Liberty and many
other national parks shut down.

   Here are some of the major incidents of
violence and bloodshed at the Temple Mount, worshiped by Jews as
the site of two biblical temples and by Moslems as the place from
which the Prophet Mohammed went to heaven.
   July 20, 1951: King Abdullah of Jordan is shot to death in the
Al Aqsa Mosque by an Arab who objected to Jordan's annexation of
the West Bank. His grandson, who later became King Hussein,
witnesses the slaying.
   Aug. 21, 1969: A mentally disturbed Australian Christian
tourist, Dennis Michael Rohan, sets fire to the Al Aqsa Mosque.
Rohan says he believed the Messiah would not come until
abominations had been cleared from the Temple Mount. The arson
causes serious damage and sparks rioting by Arabs.
   April 11, 1982: U.S. immigrant Allan Harry Goodman shoots his
way into the compound, killing a Moslem guard and wounding four
Arabs. Goodman, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1983,
claimed to be a Jewish liberator. The attack triggered anti-Israeli
riots, and 11 Arabs were killed by troops in the clashes.
   March 11, 1983: Police arrest 43 Jewish extremists who planned
to dig a tunnel and break into the Dome of the Rock.
   April 7, 1989: About 4,000 Palestinians chanting ``Palestine is
Moslem'' hurl stones on Jews praying at the Wailing Wall below. A
dozen people are injured and 37 Arabs arrested.

   George Strait, who nearly quit singing
11 years ago, is the Country Music Association's top entertainer
for the second straight year.
   Strait, frustrated over a lack of success, considered giving up
his career in 1979 to work for a company that designs cattle pens,
but he decided to keep going and soon became one of country music's
top stars.
   His second win of the association's most prestigious honor came
Monday during the CMA's 24th annual awards show.
   ``They were both surprises,'' the 38-year-old singer said after
the nationally televised show. ``Everyone nominated certainly
deserved to be there. But I'm glad they picked me.''
   Over the summer, he had the biggest hit record of his career,
``Love Without End, Amen.'' His album ``Livin' It Up'' also has
been a swift seller.
   ``It's hard not to be affected by this stuff,'' Strait said of
his awards success.
   He shared laurels Monday night at the Grand Ole Opry House with
the Kentucky HeadHunters, who won two awards, and with Clint Black
and Kathy Mattea, who were chosen best vocalists.
   Tennessee Ernie Ford, 71, ``the Ol' Peapicker,'' capped off his
career by being chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   ``Bless your little pea-pickin' hearts. Tonight I'm a happy
man,'' said Ford, a TV pioneer known for his 1955 hit record
``Sixteen Tons.''
   The Kentucky HeadHunters, a five-piece band whose shaggy hair
and rock 'n' roll stylings make them unlikely country music stars,
won vocal group of the year and best album for ``Pickin' on
Nashville.''
   ``Does this mean we get to keep our hair?'' jested HeadHunters'
guitarist Greg Martin.
   Another double winner was newcomer Garth Brooks, who won top
music video for ``The Dance'' and the Horizon Award for career
development. His music video included clips of former President
John Kennedy, the Challenger crew and John Wayne.
   Vince Gill, a singer who has done backup vocals for more than
100 of his peers, was rewarded by his friends when he won single of
the year for ``When I Call Your Name.''
   ``I've been around for a long time and I've waited for this for
a long time so I'm going to stand up here for a long time,'' Gill,
33, said in accepting the award.
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duo, were chosen best vocal duo for
the third straight year.
   ``I have just one more space on my mantel. I was really hoping
for this,'' daughter Wynonna Judd said.
   Lorrie Morgan and her late husband, Keith Whitley, won vocal
event of the year honoring performers who normally don't sing
together. Their award was for ``'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose,'' which
Whitley recorded alone. Morgan added her vocals after his death in
May 1989.
   Song of the Year, a songwriter's award, went to Jon Vezner and
Don Henry for the poignant ``Where've You Been,'' which was
recorded by Mattea, Vezner's wife.
   Fiddler Johnny Gimble won musician of the year for the fourth
time in the past five years.
   Randy Travis, who has sold more than 10 million records in just
four years, failed for the fourth time to win the entertainer of
the year award.
   Ricky Van Shelton, voted No. 1 male singer a year ago, won
nothing this year despite being nominated in three categories.
   Travis and Reba McEntire was hosts of the show.
   Winners were chosen by the 6,000 voting members of the CMA,
mostly singers, musicians, songwriters, song publishers, record
company employees and disc jockeys. The Hall of Fame honoree was
selected by an anonymous 300-member committee.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Bill to Limit Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who think children are brainwashed by
watching too many television commercials hope President Bush will
overcome his reservations and sign into law a bill that would limit
the number of TV sales pitches to youngsters.
   The legislation passed unanimously by both the House and the
Senate also would require TV stations to pay more attention to the
educational needs of young viewers.
   Broadcasters say they can live with the measure, but White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said last week the administration had
``very strong reservations'' about the bill, which would condition
a station's license renewal on how well its programs serve the
needs of children.
   The Justice Department has advised Bush that the bill
unconstitutionally intrudes into program content and thus would be
an infringement on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
   The president has not said what he will do.
   Children's TV advocates fear he will veto it.
   The legislation, which received final congressional approval
last week, would limit commercials during children's shows to 12
minutes per hour weekdays and 10.5 minutes per hour weekends.
   After similar restrictions were lifted from broadcasters in
1984, commercial air time crept up to as much as 14 minutes per
hour for some kids' shows, while the amount of informational and
educational programs for kids declined sharply, according to a
survey released by the House Energy and Commerce telecommunications
and finance subcommittee.
   By comparison, regular prime time programming averages less than
eight minutes of commercials an hour.
   The bill would establish a $6 million endowment for children's
programming and require the Federal Communications Commission to
begin a review of so-called program-length commercials - programs
that interweave programming and commercial material, usually toys.
   Some observers have noted, however, that any FCC rules that
banned such shows as ``Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles'' also could
be used against programs such as ``Sesame Street,'' which also has
a large commercial spinoff of toys and other products.
   The measure has the support of a wide array of children's,
religious and psychiatric groups. And with the unanimous support in
Congress, a Bush veto probably could be overridden.
   There has been some speculation that instead of vetoing the
bill, Bush will let it become law without his signature.

   The nation's best and brightest teen-agers are
saying ``no'' to drugs and ``yes'' to the Chinese students of
Tiananmen Square, according to a nationwide survey.
   The report on 2,000 high school juniors and seniors paints them
in a much more conservative hue than their predecessors of 20 years
ago, but with a streak of idealism.
   From a list that included Mick Jagger, Madonna, Mchael Jordan,
Tom Cruise and Jennifer Capriati, the teen-agers chose the Chinese
students who demonstrated for democracy at Beijing's Tiananmen
Square as the year's No. 1 heroes.
   Those surveyed were selected from among the 650,000 high
achievers listed in the 1990 edition of ``Who's Who Among American
High School Students.''
   ``We've heard so much about kids not having heroes,'' Paul C.
Krouse, publisher of the high school Who's Who, said Monday.
   ``The good news, is, yes they do have heroes; the bad news is
that there were no Americans among the top choices,'' he said.
   Among other findings of the 21st annual survey of high achieving
teen-agers: 25.3 percent have had sexual intercourse; 66 percent of
sexually active respondents say they always use a contraceptive; 6
percent would approve of a constitutional amendment making abortion
illegal; and half say they've changed eating habits for a healthier
lifestyle.
   Just 2.3 percent said they use marijuana, compared with 10
percent in 1970, and 98 percent said they have never tried crack,
heroine, cocaine or steroids.
   ``They certainly seem to be much more conservative than the
students of 20 years ago,'' Krouse said. ``Go to college, get a
good job and make money - there's much less concern for social
service.''
   Their college goals were topped by studies of medicine, business
and engineering sciences. Far down the list were teaching, law,
journalism and government.
   In some areas, the teen-agers favored increased control by the
adult world.
   Nearly half - 47 percent - said all high school students should
be tested for alcohol use, and 64 percent favored drug testing for
all.
   More than half - 57 percent - favored warning labels on records,
tapes, cassettes and videos containing ``objectionable material,''
such as profanity.
   In choosing their heroes, the teens named Mikhail Gorbachev a
distant second to the Chinese students, followed by Mother Teresa
and Nelson Mandela. President Bush beat out professional basketball
player Michael Jordan for fifth place by a fraction of a percentage
point.
   Black teens selected Mandela as their No. 1 hero, followed by
Jesse Jackson.
   Forty-four percent of the sexually active students had their
first sexual experience at age 16. Fifty-nine percent said they
have had only one partner.
   Teens living in rural areas appear to be more sexually active
than others. While 25.3 percent of those surveyed said they have
had sex, the figure was 30.6 percent for those from rural areas,
20.8 percent from cities and 19.2 percent from suburbs.

<HEAD>Dollar Dips Again, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar narrowed losses against the Japanese yen
and ended slightly lower Tuesday in Tokyo following approval by the
U.S. Senate of a deficit reduction plan. Share prices erased early
gains and fell.
   The dollar ended the day at 129.95 yen, down 0.10 yen from
Monday's 130.05-yen close. It opened lower at 129.65 yen and ranged
between 128.95 yen and 130.35 yen. Tuesday's close was the lowest
since Mar. 15, 1989, when the dollar closed at 129.88 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 134.89 points, or 0.57
percent, ending at 23,495.11. The index at late afternoon fell
about 550 points from the day's high before narrowing the losses
toward the end of the afternoon session, traders said.
   They said the index fell as market players, discouraged by the
slowdown in the yen's surge against the dollar, started selling
issues.
   Meanwhile, the dollar inched up in mixed trading after opening
lower following a ``substantial amount'' of dollar selling in the
Sydney market, which opens earlier than Tokyo, dealers said.
   They said the dollar turned upward in the late morning when the
Bank of Japan made ``rate check'' phone calls to some Japanese
banks. A rate check does not involve any market activity, but is a
tactic the central bank uses to make banks voluntarily refrain from
too much dollar selling.
   Also, reports that the U.S. Senate gave final approval to a $500
billion deficit-reduction plan helped support the dollar, said
Yoshikazu Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   The Senate passed an emergency bill on a voice vote Monday night
that would let the government open normally Tuesday morning and the
House concurred, 362-3. The vote came just as dollar trading closed
in Tokyo.
   The White House said President Bush would sign the legislation
and that all federal employees should report to work as scheduled.
   But the dollar will remain weak despite temporary fluctuations,
according to Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``There are no positive factors to encourage dollar buying
now,'' he said.
   ``In addition to already serious worries over the U.S. economy,
market players are heavily discouraged by the House's disapproval
of the budget plan,'' Kanai said.
   Expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will lower interest
rates are also depressing the dollar, dealers said.

   NASA expects a crowd of
5,000 to 10,000 people will watch shuttle Discovery land Wednesday.
   Discovery is scheduled to touch down on concrete Runway 22 on
Rogers Dry Lake at 9:58 a.m. EDT Wednesday, National Aeronautics
and Space Administration spokesman Don Haley said Monday.
   ``We expect good weather'' and there should be no problem from
mild Santa Ana winds, which usually don't speed up until later in
the day, he said.
   Haley said he anticipates a small crowd of between 5,000 and
10,000 spectators because it will take place during a school day.
   A record 500,000 spectators watched Columbia land at the desert
military base on July 4, 1982. Haley said the smallest crowd was
about 2,200 people who watched Columbia land last Jan. 20.
   Haley said Discovery will land on a paved runway instead of an
unpaved strip because NASA wants to test the shuttle's brakes on
concrete. Such tests are a prelude to eventual landings at the
shuttle's launch site at Cape Canaveral, Fla.

   The United States is resisting an Arab-led
groundswell in the Security Council for a resolution accusing
Israel of a ``criminal act'' in the killings of 19 Palestinians
during riots in Jerusalem.
   Arab delegates argued Monday that the world should put the
Palestinian issue on a par with the Persian Gulf crisis, which was
pushed from the top of the council's agenda for the first time in
two months.
   ``We do not understand how oil in the gulf can be valued more
highly by you than Palestinian blood and Moslem rights and
shrines,'' said Palestinian observer Zuhdi Labib Terzi, speaking to
the 15-member council during debate.
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein accused the PLO of raising the
issue to divert attention away from Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   The PLO has backed Iraq, while most of the international
community has denounced it and joined in imposing an embargo on
trade with Baghdad.
   The Security Council meeting was adjourned until this morning,
and vote prospects remained uncertain.
   It was not known whether the United States would veto, abstain
or support a milder resolution criticizing Israel. It was also
possible that a general statement would be issued without a vote.
   Western diplomats said the United States objected to a phrase in
the proposed resolution citing ``indiscriminate opening of fire ...
against unarmed Palestinian civilians.''
   The Israeli forces moved in Monday after Palestinians threw
stones at Jews praying at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem's Old City.
   Israel already has rejected the proposed resolution's provision
for a three-man fact-finding mission from the Security Council to
investigate the killings.
   In Monday's debate, 13 speakers assailed Israeli authorities for
the use of deadly forces during the riots, which also left about
140 Arabs wounded. It was the worst violence in Jerusalem in 23
years.
   The Arab envoys demanded that Israel be denounced for the
``criminal act'' of allowing police to open fire on Palestinians.
   ``We do not understand how the Security Council can ignore our
plea for protection. ... We appeal to the civilized world: Come to
our protection before it is too late,'' Terzi, the Palestinian
envoy, said in his speech Monday.
   However, Israeli ambassador Bein said the PLO had ``attempted to
ambush thousands of Jewish worshipers'' at the Wailing Wall. ``It
was a provocation that was planned ahead and the only people who
will try to gain from it are the Palestinians and (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein.''
   Saddam has suggested linking any international accord on Kuwait
with a settlement of the Palestinian issue. Western powers have
rejected any preconditions on an Iraqi pullout but suggested that
the Palestinian question could be discussed afterward.
   The new flareup in Israel has put U.S. officials in a delicate
position. Washington does not wish to be accused of exercising a
double standard toward Kuwait and the Palestinians, especially when
it is trying to keep Arab support for the U.S.-led international
force countering Iraq.
   Arab diplomats hinted Monday that a U.S. veto could jeopardize
the international and Arab coalition assembled against Iraq.
   However, the United States, Israel's staunchest ally, was
reported unwilling to vote for any fact-finding commission that
Israel would reject.
   The United States already has criticized use of live fire by
Israeli police. U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering reaffirmed that
opposition Monday and told reporters the U.S. government wants
restraint. He said extremists on both sides are trying to inflame
the situation in Jerusalem.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov said the Soviet Union ``sternly
condemns these inhuman and provocative activities on the part of
Israel.''
   Most speakers condemning Israel proposed that a U.N.-sponsored
international peace conference devise a political settlement in the
Middle East, and demanded political rights or statehood for
Palestinians.

<HEAD>Survey Ranks Kennedy Assassination as Most Memorable Moment in TV
History</HEAD>

   Blurred images of first lady Jacqueline
Kennedy, her arms reaching out in anguish from the car carrying her
mortally wounded husband, were part of TV's most memorable
broadcast, a survey found.
   President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination in Dallas topped
astronaut Neil Armstrong's 1969 moon walk as the single most
important television program in history, according to the survey
released Monday, ``The Best of the First 50 Years of Television.''
   The acclaimed television miniseries ``Roots'' rated third,
according to the survey released by the Siena Research Institute of
Siena College, a small liberal-arts school.
   Huundreds of college professors, TV and newspaper critics and
others were asked to pick television's finest efforts from a wide
range of categories.
   The purpose was to prompt discussion and criticism, said
Professor Thomas Kelly II.
   ``Roots,'' which looked at the history of slavery in America by
tracing the ancestors of one black man, was chosen the best
miniseries ever made.
   ``It was a highly dramatic historical presentation that people
found attractive and revolting at the same time,'' Kelly said.
   The survey named former RCA president and broadcast pioneer
David Sarnoff the most significant figure in television history.
The development of color broadcasts was chosen the most important
technical innovation.
   ``Hill Street Blues,'' created by Stephen Bochco, was voted the
best drama series by a 2-1 margin over second-place finisher
``Playhouse 90.'' Finishing sixth in the category was another
Bochco creation, ``L.A. Law.''
   The survey also distinguished Bochco as the second-most
significant producer in television history, behind ``All in the
Family'' creator Norman Lear.
   ``I Love Lucy'' was ranked the No. 1 comedy series of all time,
narrowly defeating ``M.A.S.H.''
   ``Gunsmoke'' was the overwhelming winner of the best Western
series category, followed by ``Bonanza.''
   ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' topped the list of best variety series,
ranked above ``Carol Burnett'' and ``Your Show of Shows.''
   Jay Sandrich, whose credits include ``Get Smart,'' ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Soap'' and ``The Cosby Show,'' was chosenmost significant
director, edging out Alfred Hitchcock and Rod
Serling.
   In the news-documentary category, ``60 Minutes'' was ranked
first, followed closely by the 1950s show ``See it Now.''

<HEAD>Attorney Challenges 2 Live Crew Jury Selection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection in the obscenity
trial of rap group 2 Live Crew was slowed by legal wrangling over
the racial makeup of the jury pool and the state's challenge of the
judge.
   Group leader Luther Campbell and band members Chris Wongwon and
Mark Ross face misdemeanor obscenity charges stemming from a June
10 adults-only performance at a nightclub in nearby Hollywood.
   If convicted, the three could be sentenced to up to a year in
jail and fined $1,000.
   Pre-trial hearings and jury selection were scheduled for today.
   Bruce Rogow, the attorney defending the black rappers,
challenged Broward County's voter-based jury pool as
unconstitutional in cases that depend on community standards, like
obscenity.
   ``Because it relies only on voter registration lists it leaves
you always with a pretty middle-class, semi-middle-aged,
disproportionately white jury pool because those are the people who
register to vote in the greatest numbers,'' Rogow said.
   Only three of 25 potential jurors questioned Monday were black.
Broward Circuit Judge June Johnson said she wanted to see the whole
70-person pool before ruling on the defense motion. No jurors for
the six-member panel were chosen Monday.
   The defense attorney didn't suggest an alternative way to choose
potential jurors.
   Rogow also represented Charles Freeman, a black record store
owner convicted last week by an all-white jury on a similar charge
for selling the group's album, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   ``Freeman's case woke everybody up to the fact there's something
wrong with the jury system,'' Campbell said Monday.
   The album, which U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez earlier ruled
obscene, has sold about 2 million copies.
   Freeman complained after his conviction that the jury ``doesn't
represent my community.''
   An elections official said about 8.5 percent of registered
voters in Broward County are black.
   Johnson rejected a prosecution request Monday that she
disqualify herself from the case because she had been a law student
of defense attorney Rogow 15 years ago. Prosecutors are appealing
the decision.
   The judge approved a defense motion that neither Freeman's
conviction nor Gonzalez's ruling should be allowed as evidence at
the group's trial.
   Most obscenity cases are argued on the U.S. Supreme Court's
Miller v. California test.
   Essentially, it holds that material is obscene if the average
person, applying contemporary local community standards, would find
that it is designed to cause sexual arousal, if it depicts sex in a
patently offensive way, and if, taken as a whole, it lacks serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

<HEAD>Budget Agreement in Place, the Government is Open for Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of federal workers need
not endure the discomfort today of learning the Republic will go on
without them. The federal government is open for business.
   The three-day shutdown of the government affected mostly
tourists. It happened over a holiday weekend and caused the closing
of national monuments, parks and museums. The real pinch would have
been today when everyone was coming back to work.
   But Monday night's accord between Congress and the White House
on an emergency spending bill will give government the legal
authority to spend money until Oct. 19. By then, congressional
leaders hope to work out a deficit-reducing budget that will carry
things through next September.
   The alternative would have been to let the government's 2.4
million employees show up for work this morning and then send home
all but those whose services are considered essential.
   By some estimates that could have meant roughly 2 million of
those people would learn that the government was prepared to do
without their services and they would have to do without their pay.
   The prospect of this made some angry.
   ``It's demoralizing,'' said John Sturdivant, president of the
700,000-member American Federation of Government Employees. ``All
the anxiety, all the wasted time on sending out furlough notices
and memos.''
   Essential workers included air traffic controllers, law
enforcement agents, prison guards and nurses in Veterans'
Administration hospitals. Thousands of other federal employees -
ranging from meat inspectors to press secretaries to U.S. troops in
the Middle East - remained on the job after government
authorization to pay them expired Friday night.
   But the government was planning to send home the bulk of the
people who collect its taxes, monitor its environment, support its
farmers and other day-to-day operations.
   Some employees were not told in advance whether they were
considered essential, and their job status for today was left
hanging over the weekend.
   ``I'm really rather confused about what is going on,'' Vic Lara,
who processes Social Security claims in Mesa, Ariz., said Monday.
``There's a chance I might not be working. It's hard enough to make
it on my pay level at full time.''
   One official who declined to be identified by name or agency
said the Office of Management and Budget had set guidelines stating
that normally only 15 percent of a civilian agency should be
considered essential.
   Fifteen percent would mean 360,000 people would stay on the job
and about 2 million would be sent home. However, in past shutdowns
only a few hundred thousand have gone home.

<HEAD>Chess Foes Kasparov, Karpov Take Up Where They Left Off - With a
Draw</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bitter foes Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov
finally sat down to their long-awaited world chess rematch, but
five hours after their first game began, the result was the same as
the last time they met - a draw.
   The two opened the 1990 World Chess Championship on Monday at
the Hudson Theater, where a hushed crowd of about 700 paid up to
$100 a ticket to watch the first of 24 scheduled games.
   After 30 moves apiece, Kasparov, the champion, offered a draw
and Karpov accepted. The two play again Wednesday.
   When they last met for the championship in 1987 the competition
ended in a draw and Kasparov retained the title he won from Karpov
in 1985.
   They are polar opposites when it comes to chess styles, politics
and personalities. Their rivalry is intense.
   Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess,
has a bold, attacking style. Karpov, 39, relies on methodical,
defense-minded strategies.
   The younger man is a flamboyant champion who does not hesitate
to criticize his country's communist leaders. The older chessman is
a Communist Party member who has been quoted as saying, ``I have
two loves: communism and chess.''
   Kasparov plays under the flag of the Russian republic, not the
Soviet Union, in protest against a government he calls tyrannical.
   On Monday, Kasparov opened with the Byrne Variation of the
King's Indian Defense, named for Robert Byrne, The New York Times
chess columnist who popularized it.
   As the two played, the audience of several hundred, including
actors Steve Martin and Rick Moranis, sat in rapt silence. The
crowd offered up a ``shhhhhhhh'' at one point when someone in the
back spoke up.
   The game ended when Kasparov took a pawn from Karpov, evening
their forces.
   ``It's an unavoidable draw,' said international master Vitaly
Zaltzman of New York.
   Chess buffs in attendance said the lack of a victor didn't
bother them.
   ``It's not very often that you get to see the two best chess
players in the world,'' said William Mulcahy, 36. He paid $100 to
see the game and said he'll be back to see another.
   ``I wouldn't want to be on that stage right now,'' said
10-year-old Matthew Blank. ``I'd be killed in 15 moves. But
someday, I wouldn't mind.''
   This year's tournament is to feature 12 games in New York, then
12 in Lyon, France. The winner will receive $1.7 million and the
loser $1.3 million.
   The match, played on a board linked to a computer, is aimed at
the TV generation.
   Above the stage is a screen, about 10 feet high, bearing a
drawing of a blue and pink chess board with black and white pieces.
When Kasparov or Karpov makes a move, the pieces on the screen
move, too, for the audience's benefit.
   Two video screens, about 5 feet high, flank the center screen,
allowing the audience to see the players up close.
   Karpov appeared calm during Monday's match, looking at times as
if he had just woken up.
   Kasparov pressed his chest against the table and fidgeted,
bouncing one foot, puffing out his cheeks, scowling, wincing,
pursing his lips. He often assumed his most famous pose: cheeks or
forehead enveloped in both hands.
   Karpov surprised many of the grandmasters present when on his
fifth move he pursued a line of play the two had ever used in
their 121 previous matches.
   He chose a series of moves known as the Saemisch Variation, a
flexible opening that allows white to attack on either side of the
board.
   Observers felt Kasparov's 19th move - attacking Karpov's rook
with his bishop - was a mistake and a turning point in the game.
   ``Karpov played rather listlessly in the opening, but Kasparov
pressed too hard and nearly let (the game) get away,'' said
grandmaster Joel Benjamin of New York.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A protest over Aboriginal land rights
turned violent today as a group of about 400 demonstrators ripped
down the state Parliament's front gate and clashed with police.
   A police spokesman said 11 protesters were arrested and charged
with offenses ranging from assaulting police to malicious damage.
   The violence broke out after several protesters scaled the iron
gates of the New South Wales Parliament House and members of the
increasingly irate crowd managed to rip out two sections of the
gate.
   Protesters poured toward Parliament's front door and were met by
police reinforcements. Scuffles broke out as police battled to
remove the protesters.
   Police kept the protesters from entering the building. They
managed to force the crowd back onto the street and formed a human
chain to cover the six-meter-wide hole in the fence.
   The demonstrators took away a section of the cast-iron front
gate and dumped it in the street. Chanting and waving signs, they
also began throwing beer cans and rocks at police.
   The march was organized to protest an alleged lack of
consultation over changes that the state government plans in the
Aboriginal Land Rights Act. The amended act is expected to be
passed by the state Parliament's Upper House this week.
   Last month, the Aboriginal Land Council and the state government
reached an agreement that both said would guarantee land council
autonomy.
   Land Council chairman David Clark described it as a ``historic''
agreement because it was the first time Aborigines, Australia's
indigenous people, were consulted in forming policies that affect
them.
   The amendments give the Land Council automony at a grass-roots
level and provide for the election of a 13-member, state-level
body.
   But there is dissatisfaction in some quarters because the
amendments are shifting power away from the middle tier of the
power structure.
   State Premier Nick Greiner expressed disappointment at the
protest.
   ``This is a minority group that feels its power base has been
eroded - they're probably right about that and they are entitled to
their view,'' he said. ``They're not entitled to express it in a
ratbag way.''
   Land councils in New South Wales were established in 1983 as a
three-tiered, democratically elected system to administer
Aboriginal land.
   The councils invest their allotment of a land tax in property
and businesses. Some Aborigines, but far from all, live on rural
land that is purchased by the councils. Many of those who hold jobs
work for businesses bought by the land councils.

   The neighborhood bar that inspired the hit
television series ``Cheers'' has decided to keep its original name
- the Bull &amp; Finch Pub.
   ``The Bull &amp; Finch has been a Boston landmark for 20 years
now,'' owner Thomas Kershaw said in a statement Monday. ``Our
regulars made a compelling case to keep the Bull &amp; Finch tradition
alive.''
   Kershaw had planned to change the pub's name in time for a local
celebration next month in honor of the 200th episode of ``Cheers.''
   Ted Danson and other stars of the 8-year-old show are expected
to be in Boston on Nov. 8 to take part in the festivities, which
will include a parade.
   The Bull &amp; Finch, which opened in a basement in 1969, was a
neighborhood bar until word spread that it was the inspiration for
``Cheers.'' The TV set is a mirror image of the Boston bar.
   Now, the bar reports an estimated 500,000 tourists drop by each
year.
   ``The Bull &amp; Finch Pub is still basically a neighborhood bar.
Our neighborhood has just gotten a lot bigger,'' Kershaw said.

   Martin, said he came for the excitement and ``to see the fights

   The actors watched as defending champion Garry Kasparov and
challenger Anatoly Karpov battle to a draw in the opening match of
the 1990 World Chess Championship at the Hudson Theater.
   Martin, who appeared in such films as ``Parenthood'' and ``The

   Authorities have arrested two retired
Interior Ministry generals and charged them with masterminding the
1984 murder of popular pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko.
   Prosecutors on Monday also announced the arrests of a former
interior minister and six others on corruption charges.
   The arrests represent the first efforts by the Solidarity-led
government to prosecute former Communist officials for abuses
committed during four decades of authoritarian rule.
   When Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki became the East bloc's
first non-Communist government leader last year, he said there
would be no ``witch hunts'' or settling of scores with former
Communist officials.
   Unlike other budding democracies in Eastern Europe, there were
no arrests of ousted former high-ranking officials.
   But Mazowiecki is now running for president against Solidarity
chairman Lech Walesa and a key issue in the race is whether he has
been too slow to remove Communists from prominent positions in the
administration and industry.
   The balloting is set for Nov. 25 and Mazowiecki, a former Walesa
adviser, only announced on Thursday that he would be challenging
the Solidarity chief.
   Poland's general prosecutor, Aleksander Herzog, named the two
men arrested in Popieluszko's death as former Deputy Interior
Minister Wladyslaw Ciaston and Zenon Platek, former head of the
ministry department that had monitored the Roman Catholic church.
   ``The two generals were presented with charges that in September
and October 1984, they instigated their subordinates to kill the
Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, and on Oct. 19 they directed the
realization of the murder,'' Herzog said in a television interview.
   Four secret policemen from Platek's department were convicted in
the crime, which helped rally pro-democracy forces in predominantly
Catholic Poland at a time the Solidarity free trade union movement
had been forced underground.
   Two of those convicted have been paroled, but two others remain
in jail.
   The politically charged investigation that led to their
conviction did not find involvement by their superiors.
   The Prosecutor's office opened a new investigation into the
Popieluszko case on July 24, three weeks after the resignation of
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak. He was in charge of the
secret and uniformed police forces at the time of Popieluszko
killing.
   The civilian who replaced Kiszczak as head of the Interior
Ministry is systematically purging the department.
   In a front-page commentary in Gazeta Wyborcza today, journalist
Jerzy Jachowicz, who has covered the security services for many
years, called the arrests that began Thursday ``unprecedented.''
   He wrote: ``A great number of former functionaries of the
Interior Ministry were arrested, among them a man who even in the
1980s held the highest party and state positions. At that time, an
especially repressive and ruthless fight against any manifestation
of social independence was being carried out.''
   Among those arrested on corruption charges was former Interior
Minister Gen. Miroslaw Milewski, a one-time Communist Party
Politburo member and a Central Committee secretary.
   Milewski, 62, worked for the security service from 1944 at least
until 1981. He was interior minister in 1980-81.
   Kiszczak replaced Milewski as interior minister in July 1981.
Milewski was then appointed a Politburo member and Central
Committee secretary in charge of internal affairs until his quiet
dismissal in January 1985, shortly after the murder of Popieluszko.
   The inquiry involves ``the acceptance of material benefits of
great value, including many kilograms of gold and jewelry,'' said
Herzog.
   He did not name the others charged but said they included two
other generals and two colonels.
   He did not elaborate but stressed that the case was not
connected with the murder of Popieluszko.
   The investigation is being carried out by the Office for
Protection of the State, created when the secret service was
disbanded in May.

   Rwanda's government has stepped up efforts
to put down an invasion of ethnic Tutsi rebels by rounding up
hundreds of suspected rebel supporters.
   Meanwhile, in the northeast of that central African nation,
soldiers continued their battle with what the government is now
describing as a force of 10,000 rebels - several times largest than
earlier estimates.
   More than 230 people have been killed in the 10-day-old war, the
government announced Monday.
   In a briefing for foreign envoys on Monday, Foreign Minister
Casimir Bizimungu of Rwanda said about 500 people had been arrested
for questioning.
   News reports from France and Belgian, the former colonial power,
said up to 3,000 people, mainly members of the minority Tutsi
tribe, had been picked up.
   Diplomats in the capital, Kigali, could not give a precise
figure but said hundreds were being held in jails and at a stadium
outside the city.
   Bizimungu put the size of the invading force at 10,000 and said
30 army troops and 200 rebels had been killed. He also claimed the
rebels were ``assassinating'' civilians but did not elaborate.
   In telephone interviews, diplomats who attended the briefing
said they understood from other sources as well that civilians had
been killed in the fighting zone, but it was unclear by whom.
   One foreign envoy said travelers from the north had told him of
seeing ``many corpses,'' but had provided no specific numbers.
   Rebels calling themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front invaded
across the northern border with Uganda on Sept. 30. The force is
made up of Rwandan refugees, mainly Tutsis. Many are deserters from
Uganda's army.
   The rebels accuse the government of President Juvenal
Habyarimana of corruption, human rights abuses and dictatorial
leadership. They say theirs is not an ethnic war.
   However, this country of 6.7 million has a long history of
enmity between Tutsis and Hutus, who dominate the government.
   Nearly 100,000 Tutsi refugees have lived in Uganda since the
late 1950s and early 1960s after fleeing massacres by the Hutu
tribe.
   Habyarimana, a Hutu, has ruled Rwanda since a 1973 coup.
   Forces from other countries have been drawn into the new
conflict. France, Belgium and Zaire have sent nearly 1,500 troops,
saying the mission is to protect their citizens and embassies in
Kigali.
   The rebels have warned foreign governments not to interfere in
the fighting.
   Nearly 1,000 expatriates, mostly women and children, left Rwanda
on special flights over the weekend. But the exodus appeared to
have ended by Monday.
   Fighting was reported around the capital Friday. Shops began to
reopen and people were again allowed to move freely around the city
Monday.
   Residents today reported hearing no shooting in the capital
overnight. They said most businesses had reopened.
   Bizimungu said the country was calm, except for the northeastern
Mutara region where Rwandese soldiers were fighting the rebels. He
claimed the invaders had sophisticated weaponry including mortars,
armored vehicles and machine guns.
   In a weekend interview with a London newspaper, The Independent,
a rebel leader denyed those claims. But Maj. Peter Bayingana did
say that the rebels had pushed army troops out of the region and
set up headquarters about 12 miles inside Rwanda.
   Bayingana was also quoted as denying harming civilians: ``The
local people are astonished that we haven't done what the
government said we'd do - raping them, killing them.''

<HEAD>Pakistan Expels Four Indian Diplomats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government has ordered four
Indian diplomats expelled for ``undesirable activities'' in the
latest blow to deteriorating relations between the two countries.
   The Indian Embassy said the expulsions, ordered late Monday,
represent a move by Pakistan to whip up fears of an Indian plot to
sabotage this country's Oct. 24 parliamentary elections.
   The ousted diplomats were working at the Indian consulate in the
southern port city of Karachi. They have been ordered to leave the
country within 10 days, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry release said.
   ``These Indian officials were involved in undesirable activities
which were totally incompatible with their official status,'' the
statement said. The ministry refused to elaborate.
   ``I think it's been in the cards for some time, what with this
orchestrated thing building up in the press ... charging Indians
are doing a lot of subversive activity,'' said an Indian Embassy
spokesman, referring to almost daily reports of an Indian-backed
sabotage plot.
   Last week, army chief-of-staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg said an
``extremely dangerous'' plot to sabotage polling had been
uncovered. He hinted that a ``foreign hand'' was behind it, a term
Pakistan uses when referring to India.
   The government has since said 58 Indian-trained agents have been
arrested and scores more have slipped into the country's ethnically
troubled southern province of Sindh.
   Shooting sprees by various groups in the past five months have
killed at least 500 people in the southern cities of Karachi and
Hyderabad.
   The Indian Embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said India expelled two Pakistani diplomats during the
summer. ``This is probably also tit-for-tat,'' he said.
   Relations between India and Pakistan soured in January when a
violent secessionist uprising began in India's state of
Jammu-Kashmir.
   More than 1,300 people have died in the conflict since January,
when the Indian army launched its military crackdown on Moslem
insurgents fighting for either independence or union with Pakistan.
   The two countries have twice gone to war over Kashmir, in
1947-48 and in 1965. The wars have left Kashmir divided into
Pakistani and Indian sectors.
   Predominantly Hindu India fought Moslem Pakistan in a third war
in 1971 over Bangladesh.

   Myron ``Grim'' Natwick, the animator
who gave life to a curvaceous flapper with a kewpie-doll face whose
favorite refrain was ``Boop-Boop-A-Doop,'' has died. He was 100.
   Natwick died Sunday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center of
complications from pneumonia, hospital spokesman Ted Braun said
Monday.
   Natwick introduced the mini-skirted Betty Boop in 1930. Betty,
with help from singer Helen Kane, soon became known for her coy
trademark, ``Boop-Boop-A-Doop.''
   ``Although she was never vulgar or obscene, Betty was a
suggestion you could spell in three letters: S-E-X,'' Natwick said
in a recent interview. ``She was all girl.''
   Betty Boop marked a comeback with a cast of other classic
cartoon figures in 1988's ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
   Natwick's talents were much admired by fellow artists and others
in the animation industry, said Noel Blanc, son of the late Mel
Blanc, known as the ``man of a thousand voices.''
   ``Everybody loved Natwick,'' he said. ``Betty Boop was
everybody's favorite lady cartoon.''
   The Betty Boop character - one of the earliest animated figures
- has enjoyed a recent resurgence, said Blanc, who succeeded his
father as the voice of ``Bugs Bunny.''
   ``Her popularity in the last five years has been amazing,'' he
said. ``A cartoon character goes on forever with the happiness it
brings to people.''
   Natwick is survived by his daughter and two grandsons.

   African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela returned to prison today - but only as a visitor.
   Mandela, returning to Pollsmoor and Robben Island prisons for
the first time since his release in February, spoke to jailed ANC
members about government plans to free political prisoners.
   ``It evokes all kinds of memories ... but I'm concentrating on
the pleasant ones,'' Mandela said with a smile before boarding a
boat for the short ride from Cape Town to Robben Island.
   While waiting to get on the boat, Mandela recognized one of his
former prison guards and greeted him warmly.
   ``Oh, you are a sergeant now,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela was jailed for more than 27 years for plotting to
overthrow the government. He spent almost two decades on Robben
Island and was moved to Pollsmoor, east of Cape Town, in 1982.
   Today, he first visited prisoners at Pollsmoor, then went to
Robben Island.
   The ANC has said the government must free the political
prisoners before the black opposition movement will enter
full-scale negotiations on ending apartheid.
   The government has released dozens of prisoners in recent
months, and 15 more are to be freed Wednesday. But the ANC says
there are about 3,000 inmates they consider political prisoners.
   President F.W. de Klerk has said his government will free all
political prisoners, but he has not said how many inmates fall into
that category.
   De Klerk said today that the ANC's estimated 20,000 exiles could
begin applying for amnesty to clear the way for their return to
South Africa.
   De Klerk, who legalized the ANC in February, cautioned that
amnesty would not automatically be granted to everyone who applied.
   The ANC was banned in 1960 and launched a guerrilla campaign the
following year that was suspended two months ago.
   The release of political prisoners and the return of exiles are
two main obstacles to negotiations on ending apartheid.
   De Klerk says he wants to draw up a new constitution with
opposition groups that would allow the 5 million whites and 30
million blacks to share power. The government and the ANC have been
holding preliminary talks since May.

   The Nobel Prize in literature will be
announced on Thursday, the Swedish Academy said today.
   Under terms of the 1896 will of dynamite inventor Afred Nobel,
the award should go to a person for outstanding, idealistic work.
   The literature prize is one of five being awarded this month.
The dates for the others are set several months in advance, but the
literature prize traditionally is announced with only a few days'
notice.
   The Nobel Prize in medicine was announced Monday and shared by
an American who performed the first successful organ transplant and
an American who pioeered bone marrow transplants.
   Joseph E. Murray of Boston and E. Donnall Thomas of Bellevue,
Wash., will share the prize, worth $704,000.
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Monday in Olso, Norway,
and the prizes in chemistry and physics will be announced Oct. 17
in Stockholm.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, created by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1969, will be awarded in Stockholm on
Oct. 16.

<HEAD>Desert Shield - The Game - Teaches Sober Lessons To Armchair
Generals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've seen it on television and in the papers,
now there's the board game - Desert Shield.
   Armchair generals who hunker down with the $40 game, due to be
shipped to stores today, will learn that Iraq's brute force is no
match for U.S. technological superiority, the game's maker says.
   But Mark Herrman, a Defense Department consultant who designed
the game for Avalon Hill Game Co., said his game aims to teach
another, more sobering lesson. Driving Iraq out of Kuwait without
heavy U.S. casualties requires patience - and a little luck.
   ``There is a lot of force on the other side of the line; you
just don't go after them head on,'' Herrman said.
   Desert Shield is actually an update of a 1983 game by Herrman
called Gulf Strike in which the premise is Iran invading Saudi
Arabia.
   The game of Desert Shield simulates in living room safety the
standoff in the Persian Gulf between Iraq and the United States and
its allies. The board is a map of the gulf broken into octagonal
sections. The game pieces are cardboard rectangles representing
troops and armaments.
   Players do battle moving back and forth over the octagons, with
a die and game cards to direct the outcome.
   The game gives the U.S. side a technological advantage, and is
set up so that unless the Iraqi side shows a Napoleonic gift for
strategy, the United States wins every time. But Herrman said the
real challenge for the U.S. player is to defeat Iraq while keeping
losses down.
   Herrman cautioned prospective players that his game is not a
three-day war. ``This can take time,'' he said.
   And even if the U.S. player shows proper patience and tactics,
there is no guarantee against heavy battlefield losses.
   ``War is always chance,'' Herrman said.

   Troops killed two men in a
shootout at a farmhouse outside Belfast today, and a news agency
said one of the victims was a suspect in several attacks on police
and soldiers.
   Britain's domestic news agency, Press Association, identified
the man who was wanted for questioning as Dessie Grew. His brother,
IRA member Seamus Grew, was killed by police in 1982.
   Police in Belfast said in a statement that two men and woman
also were arrested and three rifles seized during the shootout in
the village of Loughgall, County Armagh, 30 miles southwest of
Belfast.
   Soldiers confronted the armed gang in a farmyard. People in the
area told Press Association they heard three bursts of gunfire. The
news agency said the shootings are believed to have followed an
army undercover operation.
   Security in County Armagh had been increased in the last few
weeks following a rise in the number of attacks on off-duty police
and soldiers. The attacks were blamed on the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   In May 1987, eight IRA members were shot and killed at Loughgall
in an undercover operation by British army commandos.
   The IRA men died as they launched a bomb attack on the village
police station. A bystander died when he was caught in cross fire.
   Last month, the same police station was demolished in an IRA
bombing. The building was empty at the time.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

<HEAD>Premier Urges Go-Slow Policy for Next Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng, aaking his first public pitch in
the debate over economic policy, said today that China should
pursue a policy of slow but steady growth.
   ``You can ask the ordinary folk, do they feel their living
standard has fallen? Most think things aren't going too bad, prices
are stable and goods in the markets are abundant,'' Li said,
defending a 2-year-old austerity policy that critics say has slowed
the economy too sharply.
   ``We cannot develop blindly,'' the premier said. He said
priority should be given to agriculture and the economic
infrastructure instead of opening new Special Economic Zones, which
have served to foster market-style reforms.
   After taking the lead in market reforms among socialist
countries for the past 10 years, China's aging top leadership is
engaged in a heated backstage debate over the next decade's course.
   The government is due to approve a new Five Year Plan to guide
the economy from 1991 through 1995, but as the starting date for
the plan nears, the leaders appear nowhere near agreement.
   Li said in a toast at a National Day reception Sept. 30 that the
Communist Party's decision-making Central Committee will hold a
plenum to discuss a draft plan, but he gave no date for the
meeting.
   Foreign diplomats say several drafts have been written but none
has enough support to win Central Committee approval.
   Li, 61, stepped down in July as minister of the State Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, which under ousted party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang had served as a think tank for promoting
economic reforms.
   However, Li's speech indicated he intends to continue playing a
key role in economic policy.
   The speech was delivered Aug. 2 to a conference on industrial
production and was published today in the party newspaper, the
People's Daily. The paper said it also will appear in the party's
weekly magazine, Seek Truth.
   The official media have published few statements recently from
leaders regarded as more reformist.
   But Chinese economists writing mainly in professional
publications have made guarded pleas for a resumption of price
reforms, regarded by many as the key to a successful transition
from rigid central planning to a market economy.
   In his speech, Li emphasized price stability and said state
price subsidies should be reduced gradually. An estimated one-third
of the state budget goes for price subsidies for urban residents,
who pay artificially low prices for food, housing and
transportation.
   ``Some localities and departments have started again to strive
for projects and want to invest, leaning toward speed,'' Li said.
``If this continues, the construction front will become too long,
things will be done on too large a scale ... and we will repeat the
old error of being overeager for results.
   ``We must earnestly learn the lessons of the past and advance
steadily during the Five Year Plan and coming decade,'' he said.
   Zhao's slide from power began in 1988, when hard-liners led by
Li accused him of encouraging chaotic and inflationary economic
growth. Li helped write an austerity program that has reduced
inflation from nearly 40 percent to less than 4 percent.
   However, the austerity program also forced millions of small
rural factories out of business by cutting off credit and supplies
and worsened the indebtedness of many large state factories. Reform
initiatives have halted and some reforms have been rolled back.

   David H. Souter, a mild-mannered, well-read
and previously little-known judge from New Hampshire, became
history's 105th Supreme Court justice today after pledging to ``do
equal right to the poor and to the rich.''
   In a brief ceremony in the crowded courtroom, Souter, 51, was
administered the judicial oath of office by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and almost immediately got to work hearing high court
arguments with his eight new colleagues.
   In taking the oath, Souter said, ``I do solemnly swear to
administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right
to the poor and to the rich.''
   Afterward, Souter and Rehnquist posed for photographers outside
the building on Capitol Hill before heading back inside for a
reception attended by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
other Washington dignitaries and Souter's friends and well-wishers.
   Souter, facing a group of photographers and television cameras
outside, said, ``I got to work on time this morning. I'm starting
off on the right foot.''
   As cameras clicked and whirred, Souter said, ``Hurry and load
up. I've got to go to work.''
   He also disclosed that he has found a place to live in the
Washington, D.C., area, but declined to give any details.
   A short time later, Souter took his seat at the end of bench
assigned to the newest justice for the start of the court's
regularly scheduled proceedings.
   As Souter pledged to uphold the Constitution in a separate
oath-taking ceremony Monday at the White House, President Bush
praised him as ``a very thoughtful and caring man.''
   Souter said Monday he hopes to pass on the Constitution ``in as
vigorous condition as I have received it this afternoon, as it
were, from Justice Brennan.''
   Souter was picked as Bush's first high court nominee to replace
William J. Brennan, who retired in July because of failing health.
Brennan had been a leading voice of liberalism on the court for 34
years.
   Souter joins the court at a pivotal time in its history.
   A reliably conservative majority led by appointees of former
President Reagan only recently has begun to emerge.
   The future of legalized abortion and other highly controversial
issues such as affirmative action and church-state relations hang
in the balance, with relatively little known about how Souter may
vote.
   Souter, who recently described himself as ``a moderate
conservative,'' revealed little about his views on major
constitutional issues in three days of testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee. The Senate confirmed him 90-9.
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said Monday it
is hard to predict what type of justice Souter will be.
   ``Once they are in there and they are no longer accountable to
their spouse or their God, anything can happen,'' said Biden,
apparently disregarding the fact that Souter is a bachelor.
   Souter last week underscored his own potential importance as a
swing vote. He told reporters that other justices were eager for
him to come aboard to avoid the possibility of 4-4 ties in
controversial cases.
   The court's 1990-91 term began last week with the justices
hearing arguments in cases to be decided by July.
   Before being named a federal appeals court judge by Bush earlier
this year, Souter spent seven years as a member of the New
Hampshire Supreme Court. He previously served as a trial judge and
as his state's attorney general.
   Souter lacks a permanent staff, having been assigned only a
temporary secretary and a temporary messenger. Each justice is
allowed four law clerks, two secretaries and a messenger.
   Souter said earlier he hoped to select his law clerks by next
week.
   He moved into a suite of offices formerly occupied by Justice
Antonin Scalia, who gave them up when he moved into Brennan's old
chambers.
   The gold nameplate put on the door days ago says ``Justice
Souter,'' but court officials waited until his swearing-in to
remove adhesive paper that covered the plate.

   A court today convicted a former chairman of
Japan's largest company in the Recruit scandal, an
influence-peddling case that helped bring down twoprime ministers.
   The Tokyo District Court imposed a two-year suspended prison
term and a $175,000 fine on Hisashi Shinto, 80, for accepting stock
shares at bargain prices before they were publicly listed, court
officials said.
   The non-jury trial of the former head of the Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp. has been closely watched in Japan as a test of
what constitutes a bribe in this country, where gift-giving is
common in business and politics.
   ``Considering NTT's mission to serve the public, the defendant's
position and the extent of influence caused by the scandal,
(Shinto) bears serious responsibility,'' presiding Judge Ken Toyota
said.
   NTT Chairman Masashi Kojima released a statement after the
ruling saying the company ``again apologizes for causing trouble to
the public.''
   Shinto's conviction is the latest development in the 2-year-old
scandal involving Recruit Co., an information conglomerate. The
scandal has resulted in five trials with 12 defendants, including
politicians and government employees.
   Two prime ministers - Noboru Takeshita and Sousuke Uno - and
three Cabinet members resigned after being tainted by the Recruit
affair or to take responsibility for election losses attributed to
the scandal.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, the former chairman of Recruit, was charged with
bribery for allegedly selling stock in a real estate subsidiary,
Recruit Cosmos, to about 160 influential politicians, businessmen
and government officials before the shares went public in October
1986. Ezoe has yet to be tried.
   Shinto was offered unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos for
$230,000 in September 1986. He quickly sold them at $400,000 just
after the stock went public, prosecutors said.
   Shinto denied doing any special favors for Recruit.
   The prosecution had alleged that Recruit got favorable terms on
telephone lines, maintenance and other services as it sought to
enter the telecommunicatons field. Prosecutors also claimed Shinto
helped Recruit buy two U.S.-made supercomputers.
   Shinto was chairman of NTT for less than a year when he resigned
in December 1988 in response to allegations he was involved in the
scandal.
   Earlier, as company president, Shinto guided the
telecommunications giant from government ownership to a company
whose shares are traded on the stock exchange. His arrest in March
1989 stunned Japanese business circles.

   John Young is looking for love but he
must be going to all the wrong places, at least when he takes his
car.
   Two months after he put a bumper sticker on his car trunk
advertising ``wife wanted'' along with his phone number, no one has
given the single Minnesota native a jingle.
   ``I've had no takers. Absolutely none. Not even a crank call,''
said the 45-year-old convenience store manager who is divorced.
   ``I think it's being taken lightly, like a joke, rather than a
serious attempt at making contact,'' Young said Monday.
   ``I'm pretty much of a homebody. If you're a mid-40s homebody,
alone, what do you do?'' he said.
   Bars aren't his scene, he said. He'd rather read, fish or listen
to music.
   ``I spent 14 years in the infantry, 2{ years in Vietnam, and I
like things that are peaceful,'' he said, seated on the couch of
the Largo mobile home he shares with a black feline named Mama Cat.
   Young, who describes himself as intelligent, sensitive and
curious, said his ideal woman would be intelligent and pretty.
``And from there on, it's just a matter of chemistry.''
   What does he offer?
   ``I care,'' he said. ``And I'm absolutely serious about it.''

   An Air Force review found the Northrop Corp.,
manufacturer of the B-2 stealth bomber, beset with problems in
nearly every aspect of its business, a lawmaker said today.
   Concerned about Northrop's poor performance in the production of
several weapons systems, the Air Force conducted an in-depth study
of the company in June and July that ound problems in six major
areas.
   The service identified weaknesses in systems engineering; the
transition from research and development to production; software
management; subcontract management; organization and personnel; and
business systems, which includes cost and schedule estimates.
   ``The Air Force team found that Northrop failed miserably in
every key management area necessary to the successful development
and production of a major weapons system,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
its investigations subcommittee.
   The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley of
Virginia, said he found ``it distressing that a company that has
been entrusted with over $36 billion since 1980, and that has been
counted upon to manage programs critical to our national defense,
could have so many fundamental deficiencies.''
   The Associated Press obtained a draft copy of Dingell and
Bliley's opening statements for a subcommittee hearing today.
   Loye Miller, a spokesman for Northrop in the Washington, D.C.,
area, said the company had not seen Dingell's statement and would
have no immediate comment on the allegations.
   Justice Department officials told the panel in July that the
California company should be barred from government business.
   The officials described how Northrop falsified reports on the
air-launched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the
Harrier AV-8B jet. Northrop also manufactures the B-2 bomber and is
in competition with Lockheed for the contract on the Advanced
Tactical Fighter.
   The company's action led to its guilty plea in February on 34
charges of fraud and a fine of $17 million, the largest criminal
fine ever imposed on a defense contractor.
   At the same hearing, John Betti, undersecretary of defense for
acquisitions, said he did not anticipate any debarment procedure
against the company.
   Betti testified that Pentagon officials overseeing management at
Northrop ``have assured me that all monitoring systems necessary to
protect the interests of the taxpayers and national security are
currently in place and working well at Northrop.''
   In his statement for today's hearing, Dingell noted a June 5
letter to Kent Kresa, Northrop's president and chief executive
officer, in which the Air Force said that ``while some programs
have shown improvement in the past year, others, including Tacit
Rainbow (a missile program) and key classified programs, continue
to reflect poor performance.''
   J.J. Welch Jr., the assistant secretary of the Air Force for
acquisition, informed Kresa in the letter that the service planned
an in-depth review.
   ``The nature of the performance problems is most serious,''
Welch said. ``I encourage your direct, personal involvement in
promptly correcting them.''
   Two months later, after the Air Force had conducted its review,
Betti testified before the panel. Although Betti had been briefed
three times before his appearance, he had not been told of the Air
Force's findings from its review, according to Dingell.

<HEAD>50 Fishermen Killed, 100 Missing in Bay of Bengal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain sent tidal waves surging up
the Bay of Bengal, killing at least 50 fishermen and swamping the
boats of hundreds of others, newspapers and officials said today.
   At least 5,000 boats carrying tens of thousands of fishermen
were in the bay when the storm-driven waves crested up to 5 feet
higher than normal Monday, the Bengali-language newspaper Dainik
Bangla said.
   At least 50 fishermen were killed and at least 100 others were
missing, the newspaper said. The fate of hundreds of others was not
known, it added.
   The stricken districts lie 75 to 125 miles south of Dhaka,
capital of this low-lying nation. Affected were four coastal
districts: Patuakhali, Noakhali, Bhola and Barguna; as well as the
inland Barisal district, where several tidal rivers overflowed.
   A senior official at the sea resort town of Cox's Bazar, 185
miles southeast of Dhaka, said searches would be launched for the
missing men as soon as the rain stops.
   The storms and resulting tidal waves are an annual and deadly
phenomenon in October, November and December, the official noted
when contacted by telephone. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he
said he did not yet know the number of deaths or the extent of
damage.
   A senior official at the Relief Ministry in Dhaka said vast
areas of crops, mostly rice, had been devastated and a
``substantial number'' of mud and straw houses were damaged. He
also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Heavy rains across the nation for the past three days have
caused flooding in many areas, the Weather Office reported. But so
far there were no reports of other mass casualties in inland areas.
   In Dhaka, between one and two feet of water stood in shantytowns
and other low-lying areas.

   An estranged couple has offered to
sell one of their three sons, saying they need the money to pay
bills.
   Phillip and Judith Walther, who live in the small town of Moe in
southeastern Victoria state, posted notices at a shopping center
offering to sell one of their three sons: Benjamin, 21 months;
Andrew, 4; and David, 7.
   The family could not be contacted for comment today, but
Walther, 31, told a television interviewer Monday he ``would have
to get at least $15,000 for one of them'' to repay his debts.
   Victoria's Community Services department said it was undecided
whether the boys should be taken from their parents.
   Community Services Minister Kay Setches said the family's case
was being assessed during discussions with the family.
   ``It is a matter of concern to me where parents are driven to a
situation where they would make this offer, and what we want to do
is ensure they know the degree of support that is available to
them,'' she said.
   She said it was too early to consider charges against the couple
and called the offer to sell the children a ``cry for help.''
   ``When you look at the degree of pressure the family is under
when they are in economic difficulties, they can be driven to make
statements they might not want to carry out in a day or two's
time,'' she said.
   But she added: ``Certainly it's a type of child abuse to
actually say to your children: `I'm going to sell you' - that
concerns me.''

   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung,
backed by 200 supporters staging a sit-in, fasted for a second day
today to demand that President Roh Tae-woo disband a military
intelligence unit.
   Dissidents and radical students called for nationwide protests
this week, including a major rally Saturday in Seoul. They are
angry over allegations that Roh's government conducted military
surveillance of more than 1,300 citizens.
   Roh fired his defense minister and the powerful chief of
military intelligence on Monday to minimize the impact of the
surveillance scandal, the most serious since he took office in
early 1988.
   About 200 members of Kim's party staged a sit-in to support the
opposition leader, who began the hunger strike Monday at his
office. Kim is demanding that the government disband the Defense
Security Command - the intelligence unit - and carry out economic
reform.
   Roh appealed for a truce in the political fighting and asked the
opposition to settle issues through dialogue.
   Kim's Party for Peace and Democracy rejected his overtures.
   It also threatened to mount a national movement to topple Roh if
the president rejects Kim's calls for reform and refuses to end
``dirty political operations aimed at harassing opposition
parties.''
   Domestic politics have been in turmoil since August when
opposition lawmakers resigned from parliament en masse, charging
the government with railroading bills and curtailing democratic
reforms.
   The hardened position of Kim, a veteran opposition leader, was
apparently propelled by mounting public criticism of Roh's
administration.
   In stepping up their attack on Roh, dissidents said the
allegations that the military spied on civilians showed Roh's
government is ``a disguised military government.''
   Dissident leaders decided Monday to hold anti-government rallies
with radical students this week in Seoul and provincial cities. Roh
pledged to keep the military out of politics, and anger over the
allegations prompted the opposition to set aside their divisions
and join forces.
   Yoon Suk-yang, a 24-year-old deserter from the military
intelligence unit, alleged last week that the military was spying
on dissidents, intellectuals and opposition lawmakers. Yoon
provided confidential papers, computer discs and data he said were
evidence of massive and systematic spying on civilians.
   Roh captured two-thirds of the 299-member National Assembly in
January by merging his party with two minor opposition groups.
   But his popularity has fallen because of inflation, social
disturbances and disputes within the enlarged governing party.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
federal rule that lets employees of private hospitals, according to
their jobs, organize into eight separate collective bargaining
units.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the American Hospital
Association seeking fewer employee categories.
   The National Labor Relations Board adopted the rule in 1989. It
recognizes separate bargaining units for physicians, registered
nurses, other professional employees, medical technicians, skilled
maintenance workers, clerical workers, guards and other
nonprofessional employees.
   The regulation applies to employees at more than 4,000 private
hospitals nationwid.
   The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
rule last April.
   The hospital industry favors recognizing no more than three
bargaining units - professional employees, guards and
nonprofessional employees.
   From the employer's perspective, the appeals court noted, ``The
more units there are the more costly it will be for the employer to
negotiate collective bargaining contracts. And work stoppages will
be likelier because there will be more separate decision-makers
(to) call a strike.''
   But the appeals court said the NLRB did not exceed its authority
in fixing on eight categories.
   The board could have chosen a larger number, the appeals court
said, noting New York regulators had permitted 21 separate hospital
bargaining units.
   ``It is not for us to fine-tune the regulatory process by
telling the labor board that its rule should make slightly more
distinctions that it does, or slightly fewer. ... We therefore
uphold its rule without pretending that we consider it Utopia,''
the appeals court said.
   Bush administration lawyers, even though they defended the NLRB
rule, urged the justices to hear the hospitals' appeal.
   The government lawyers said a high court ruling would head off a
host of local challenges that could disrupt labor-management
relations at hospitals.
   The case is American Hospital Association vs. NLRB, 90-97.

   More than 20 people working for German
companies are suspected of helping Iraq obtain chemical weapons and
other arms, a prosecutor said today.
   Darmstadt state prosecutor Thomas Brand said the suspects were
employed by nine German companies.
   Of the more than 20 people suspected, Brand said, four people
are in investigative custody and three have been released either on
bail or for health reasons. They remain under investigation.
   ``Our suspicions have been widely confirmed,'' said Brand, who
heads an inquiry into illegal exports to Iraq that began three
years ago, long before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Brand declined to say exactly how many people are suspected of
violating export laws.
   The inquiry was stepped up after a recent confidential report by
an independent expert, he said. He declined to disclose details of
the report.
   The newsmagazine Der Spiegel said in its issue Monday that the
report concluded six Iraqi poison gas factories were delivered by
German companies.
   Brand said one suspect, Peter Leifert, a partner in the
Hamburg-based Water Engineering Trading Co., has admitted
delivering chemical equipment that can be used for military
purposes by Iraq. Spiegel said Leifert also worked for German
intelligence for about two years.
   In a series of articles since August, Spiegel has named nearly
40 German companies it said had played a major role in supplying
Iraq with equipment needed to produce chemical, biological, nuclear
and conventional weapons.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge to San Francisco Affirmative Action Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact an
affirmative action plan for the San Francisco Fire Department.
   The court, without comment, rejected a union's challenge that
said the plan violates the rights of white men.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last December upheld the
city's agreement to hire and promote women and minorities to
overcome past discrimination.
   The appeals court said the plan is ``fundamentally fair,
adequate and reasonable'' and narrowly tailored to avoid hurting
white men unnecessarily.
   In upholding a federal judge's approval of the agreement, the
appeals court noted that the fire department first hired blacks in
1955 and women in 1987.
   The city's hiring and promotion tests for firefighters
repeatedly were judged discriminatory from 1970 to 1987.
   The consent decree the city signed to implement affirmative
action ended 18 years of lawsuits by women and minority groups.
   The Reagan administration challenged the city's affirmative
action efforts in 1984 and was joined by Firefighters Union Local
798. The Bush administration did not join the union's appeal to the
Supreme Court to throw out the plan.
   In December 1987, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San
Francisco also ordered the fire department to crack down on racial
harassment after a swastika was found in the office of two minority
firefighters. Fire Chief Ed Phipps resigned shortly afterward.
   When the consent decree was approved, the department had 225
minority members and seven women on a force of 1,100.
   The plan set long-term goals of 40 percent minorities and 10
percent women in the department. The agreement called for filling
55 percent of all openings with minorities and 10 percent with
women through 1994.
   The city also agreed to develop unbiased examinations for hiring
and promotion, and to promote 33 minority firefighters to the rank
of lieutenant.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the firefighters union
said hiring and promotion goals were based improperly on the
population of the city and county of San Francisco. The union said
the affirmative action plan should be based on the composition of
the work force in a larger area of Northern California.
   The union also alleged that minorities who lack minimum
qualifications will be promoted, and contended that the plan
unlawfully seeks to impose racial balance in the department.
   The case is San Francisco Firefighters Local 798 vs. City and
County of San Francisco, 90-248.

   Bush and members of Congress went about their work as federal
workers breathed a collective sigh of relief that there would be no
forced furloughs. The government had faced the prospect of a
shutdown of non-essential services today without an agreement.
   The budget crisis worsened late last week when the House
rejected a bipartisan plan that called for $134 billion in tax
increases and a wide array of military and program spending cuts.
Increases in Medicare fees were rolled back slightly and an
alternative plan has been approved.
   Democrats have complained the budget plans have been unfairly
weighted against the middle income taxpayers to the benfit of
wealthier Americans. Bush's remarks indicated that the final tax
package is still in negotiation.
   Raising income tax rates would be contrary to Bush's oft-stated
pledge during the 1988 presidential campaign not to raise taxes.
   There were minimal disruptions in services during the long
Columbus Day weekend. Tourist attractions such as the Washington
Monument and Smithsonian Institutioin were shut for three days, but
the full brunt of a shutdown did not occur.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Natural Gas Costs Rejected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away a
multibillion dollar dispute over natural gas costs.
   The court, without comment, refused to reinstate a federal
regulation to ease a burden on pipeline companies. The regulation
dated to an over supply of gas in the early 1980s.
   The pipeline companies often signed contracts in the late 1970s
and early '80s that required them to buy quantities of gas from
producers at a specified price. The pipelines were required to pay
for the gas even if they couldn't sell it.
   The so-called take-or-pay agreements were signed when the price
of gas was higher than it is today. Natural gas supplies began to
exceed demand by 1982 because of warm winters, a recession and
customers' switching to alternate fuels.
   As a result, the pipeline companies were left with billions of
dollars in costs for unwanted gas.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adopted a plan in 1987
to help the pipelines cope, allowing the companies to charge
customers part of the cost.
   The surcharge is based on a comparison of the amount of gas
customers bought in 1982 and the reduced amounts they purchased
from 1983 to 1986.
   The more they bought in 1982 and the less purchased from them in
the ensuing years, the greater the pipeline companies' share of the
take-or-pay burden.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here threw out the plan in
December, saying the charges to pipeline customers amounted to a
retroactive change in rates without advance warning.
   ``Indeed, the commission now even forces past customers who no
longer purchase any gas from (the pipelines) to pay their share of
the take-or-pay liability,'' the appeals court said.
   Conversely, the appeals court said, current customers who didn't
buy gas from a pipeline until after 1986 would not have to pay any
part of the liability.
   The appeals court, which reviewed the problem in a case
involving Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., sent the case back to the
commission for another solution.
   Gas customers in Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky and
Ohio who could face higher gas rates because of the appeals court
ruling joined the Bush administration and Tennessee Pipeline in
urging the Supreme Court to step in.
   Other gas customers urged the high court not to disturb the
appeals court ruling, saying FERC exceeded its authority in
ordering them to shoulder costs retroactively.
   The cases are The Berkshire Gas Co. vs. Associated Gas
Distributors, 89-1988; Tennessee Small General Service Customer
Group vs. AGD, 89-1989; Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. vs. AGD,
89-1990; National Fuel Gas Supply Corp. vs. AGD, 89-2000; Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission vs. AGD, 89-2016

   The parents of an emotionally disturbed Texas
boy allegedly beaten by his school principal lost a Supreme Court
appeal today.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that the
child's constitutional rights were not violated.
   Only Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case.
Four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Tracy Fee was 12 and attending a class for emotionally troubled
youngsters at a Dickinson, Texas, school when the incident occurred
in 1985.
   His parents, Ronald and Nancy Fee, said school principal Joseph
Herndon brutally beat the boy when he refused to submit to being
paddled three times for misbehaving in class.
   The Fees said Herndon punched Tracy on the jaw and held him down
on the floor and hit him numerous times on the buttocks with a
paddle. They also accused Herndon of grabbing Tracy by the neck and
throwing him back into a chair so that the child's head snapped
back and hit the wall.
   Herndon and a teacher who was present said the principal paddled
the boy three times on the buttocks but did no more. School
officials said any injuries Tracy suffered were caused by his
thrashing about on the floor of the principal's office as he sought
to avoid the paddling.
   The school officials also noted Mrs. Fee previously had
authorized Herndon to administer three paddle swats to Tracy if he
misbehaved.
   The Fees said their son was hospitalized for six months in a
psychiatric ward because of the beating, and said they spent
$90,000 for medical care. They said he has not fully recovered.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May that the Fees
are not entitled to sue in federal court alleging their son's
constitutional due-process rights were violated.
   It noted Texas law forbids use of excessive force against school
children.
   ``We find no constitutional warrant to usurp classroom
discipline where states, like Texas, have taken affirmative steps
to protect their students from overzealous disciplinarians,'' the
appeals court said.
   The case is Fee vs. Herndon, 90-249.

   ``Israeli security forces need to be better prepared for such

what is needed most of all is calm on both sides. We want to see
the longstanding policy of open access to holy places preserved.''
   Bush renewed an earlier warning that Saddam Hussein should not

   Saddam's efforts to do this are ``not working,'' Bush said.

   Discovery's astronauts awoke early
today to begin their final full day of a nearly flawless mission in
which they dispatched the Ulysses probe on a five-year journey to
explore the sun.
   The flight, NASA's first shuttle mission in nearly six months,
is scheduled to end Wednesday morning at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif. Good weather is expected for the landing.
   Commander Richard N. Richards and pilot Robert Cabana completed
a series of tests this morning to make sure Discovery's systems
were ready for the fiery dive through the atmosphere and touchdown
at the desert base.
   A problem was reported when a heater on one of the shuttle's
three auxiliary power units failed, but a backup heater was put
into operation and was working fine, Mission Control said.
   The auxiliary power units are used during landing, while the
heaters operate during the mission to keep the fuel lines from
freezing. Even if both heaters failed on a unit, they could be
manually operated, Mission Control said.
   Later today, Richards and Cabana planned to briefly fire twin
braking rockets, which will be used Wednesday to drop the shuttle
out of orbit for the trip back to Earth.
   Also, the crew of five was scheduled to stow cabin gear. The men
retracted the shuttle's robot arm back into the cargo bay this
morning. The arm was extended Sunday for an experiment.
   Astronauts Bruce Melnick and Bill Shepherd ran one final test of
an experimental system that uses voice commands to control the
shuttle cameras. Shepherd has had trouble getting it to recognize
his voice, but he finally met with success today after retraining
the system.
   At Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA began moving the
shuttle Columbia off a launch pad and back to the assembly building
today because of bad weather expected from Tropical Storm Klaus.
   Both Columbia and Atlantis will remain in the assembly building
until the storm passes, NASA officials said.
   Mission Control awakened the crew shortly before 2 a.m. EDT
today with the songs, ``Fanfare for the Common Man,'' a favorite of
Cabana's, and the fight song for the University of Missouri,
Richards' alma mater.
   After the brief serenade, the crew quietly went about their
morning tasks aboard the shuttle.
   Their primary goal was accomplished Saturday with the successful
deployment of the Ulysses sun probe. The $250 million European
probe continued to speed through space on its roundabout trip to
the sun.
   It is headed towards Jupiter so it can use that giant planet's
gravity to sling it back through the solar system and into a polar
orbit around the sun. Ulysses is expected to pass over the sun's
south pole in 1994 and the north pole in 1995.
   Before the crew went to bed Monday, Mission Control's Kathy
Thornton told them Ulysses still was doing ``great - no changes.''
   The smooth flight has delighted NASA officials, who have been
plagued by a number of problems in recent months.
   Flight director Ron Dittemore described the mission Monday as
one of the ``cleanest'' shuttle flights ever.
   ``The greatest pleasure comes when you work a flight and
everything goes perfectly nominal,'' Dittemore said. ``Hopefully,
we're getting better every time we go.''
   The astronauts spent much of Monday working on experiments, but
they took time out to sing ``Happy Birthday'' to mission specialist
Tom Akers' wife, Kaye, who turned 34.
   They floated in front of a shuttle TV camera as they sang. Mrs.
Akers and other crew members' relatives saw the tape Monday
afternoon at Mission Control.
   After viewing the tape and another one showing the astronauts
eating dinner and relaxing at the end of their work day, the
families sent up this message: ``You guys are really getting good
at throwing unusual birthday parties. How in the world are you
going to top this one next year?''

   A Cambodian dance troupe may cancel peformances
in New York after four of its members defected and a fifth received
death threats, said the troupe's director.
   The tour's sponsors say the defections and alleged threats are
the result of Cambodian-Americans trying to undermine the troupe
for political reasons.
   The director of the Cambodian Classical Dance Company, Proeung
Chhieng, 42, pleaded for help Monday.
   ``We beg you to help us,'' Chhieng told reporters through an
interpreter at the Joyce Theater, where the dancers were scheduled
to perform tonight. ``We don't want our art and culture to get
lost,'' he said.
   Three of the company's 36 dancers defected last week in St.
Paul, Minn. A fourth defected Sunday in Lowell, Mass., by walking
into a police station and requesting political asylum.
   The troupe is part of the government-controlled University of
Fine Arts in Phnom Penh. The tour's chief sponsor in this country
is the U.S. Indochina Reconciliation Project.
   Project director John McAuliff said Monday the private,
non-profit group works with the people of Laos, Vietnam and
Cambodia. He said certain Cambodian-Americans have formed an
``aggressive, organized'' network that has used threats, coercion
and propaganda to influence the dancers and the media.
   ``What has clearly happened is some of the political groups that
are against the government in Phnom Penh have done the one thing
they can do: pressure the dancers to defect,'' he said. ``It's been
clear that they have been trying very hard to undermine the tour.''
   One of the troupe's star dancers, Yim Devi, was the target of an
attempted abduction at knifepoint Monday by a Cambodian man who has
followed her around the country since the company performed in Los
Angeles, according to Eileen Blumenthal, the company's executive
producer.
   A decision has not yet been made about whether the dancers will
perform in New York, Blumenthal said. The company manager said Devi
was ``frightened and confused'' because of the threats against her.
   The troupe's tour marks the first artistic exchange between the
United States and Cambodia since the Vietnam War.
   Chhieng, who had been a child star in the Cambodian Ballet,
survived the terror of the Khmer Rouge, which massacred about 3
million people, including Chhieng's parents, 12 of his brothers and
sisters and most of his relatives.
   The 1000-year-old Cambodian dance is characterized by precise,
angular body movements and fluidity. Dancers must be sewn into
their costumes, a process that takes three hours.

<TEXT>
   The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was
observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem
``Imagine'' was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130
nations.
   The song was played shortly after 10 a.m. following a brief
ceremony at the United Nations that featured the ex-Beatle's widow,
Yoko Ono. Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary
general, also provided a brief introduction. A recorded message
from the slain Beatle was played as well.
   ``In celebration of John's life, let's use our power of
dreaming,'' Ono said. ``Let's dream of trees growing in abundance,
birds flying in clear air, fish swimming in clear water and our
children living in joy.
   ``Let's dream of men and women feeling good together and people
embracing each other regardless of their creed and religion,'' she
said. ``Let's dream of all races praising one another in the
knowledge that the differences are what makes the human race.''
   The U.N. Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full
with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150
people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby. A
group of 10 teen-agers in blue jeans and T-shirts sat on the floor,
held hands and meditated.
   More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries
had signed on for the satellite broadcast by last week. U.S. Armed
Forces television and radio beamed the event to 80-plus countries.
MTV was to broadcast the program in 25 countries, said network
spokeswoman Andrea Smith.
   More than 50 fans gathered at the late Beatle's sidewalk star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles to honor the
singer-songwriter. Some held candles and others carried birthday
balloons.
   Beatles fans gathered in Liverpool today to pay tribute to
Lennon. Civic dignitaries planned to join them at the city's Cavern
Walks shopping precinct - on the ite of the legendary Cavern Club
where the group was discovered.
   In New York, fans planned a tearful pilgrimage to the spot
outside the Dakota apartment building where Lennon was gunned down
almost 10 years ago.
   ``Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to
handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more
importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual,
human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom
and peace,'' said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakia's
leading popular music publication.
   Jeff Pollack, head of the California-based Pollack Media Group,
proposed the idea to Ono, who gave it the go-ahead. She believes
recent events around the world - in Germany, Eastern Europe and
particularly the Middle East - show the importance of Lennon's
peace message.
   ``When this was discussed, we had no knowledge of what would
happen in Iraq and Kuwait, you know. And now it seems very
appropriate that this be sung all over the world,'' Ono said.
   ``I don't know, the timing is incredible. It's beyond me ...
It's beautiful.''
   ``Imagine'' is Lennon's musical vision of a world free of war
and poverty. Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940 and helped lead the
Beatles to international stardom, along with co-members Paul
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
   He fatally gunned down by an obsessed fan outside his Manhattan
apartment building in December 1980.
   The tribute coincides with the release of a four-compact disc
set of 73 songs, including 61 written by Lennon. Also in honor of
Lennon's 50th birthday, McCartney is releasing his live version of
``Birthday.''

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Case on Excluding Hispanics from Juries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the rights of a Hispanic man were violated when he was
convicted of attempted murder by a jury from which Hispanics had
been excluded.
   The justices said they would use the New York City case to
decide whether Hispanics may be excluded from juries because they
might not accept official translations of testimony given in
Spanish.
   The court will hear an appeal by Dionisio Hernandez, convicted
in 1986 of trying to kill his girlfriend and her mother in a
shooting outside a Brooklyn restaurant. Two restaurant patrons also
were wounded.
   The prosecutor in the case used what are known as peremptory -
or automatic - challenges to bar Hispanics, saying there was
uncertainty whether they could ``accept the interpreter as the
final arbiter'' of what was said by each witness.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, said
Hernandez was not the victim of unlawful racial bias because the
prosecutor made his decision on a non-discriminatory basis.
   It based its ruling on a 1986 Supreme Court decision that said
prosecutors may not exclude blacks from juries unless the
prosecutors can prove they acted for reasons that are racially
neutral.
   The case acted on today is Hernandez vs. New York, 89-7645.

<TEXT>
   There was a little bit of
Adrian Kronauer in the Navy chief petty officer who started the
first live armed forces broadcasts in Saudi Arabia today.
   ``It's 9:05 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 9. Goooood Maaaaawrning Saudi
Arabia,'' bellowed disk jockey Rich Yanku, echoing the famous
character played by comedian Robin Williams in the movie about
Armed Forces Radio in Vietnam.
   ``We really didn't want to do a Goooood Maaaawrning Saudi
Arabia, but it probably would be anti-climactic if we didn't,''
said Navy Lt. Arnie Pon, a Bronx native who heads the unit making
the live broadcasts from an air base in Saudi Arabia.
   The first song on Desert Shield Network FM 107 brought the
troops a little closer to home - The Clash's ``Rock The Casbah''
about a fight over ``boogie sound'' in a traditional Middle Eastern
city.
   Lt. Col. David MacNamee, commanding officer of Armed Forces
Radio and Television in Saudi Arabia, said the kingdom's government
put some restrictions on broadcast content. Television broadcasts
are under negotiation.
   He would not detail the restrictions. But he said they were
basically common sense guidelines about what might offend listeners
in a traditional Moslem society that bars alcohol and the mixing of
men and women in public.
   Besides Yanku of Albany, N.Y., the disc jockeys include two air
force staff sergeants - Harry Lockley, 25, of New Castle, Pa., and
John Haynes, 27, of Albany, N.Y. The fourth is Army Spec. Brooke
Perkins, 35, who was previously based in West Germany.
   The general format is mostly rock 'n' roll or country music from
their 8,800 compact discs interspersed with news, sports and public
service messages. They range from pep talks on Saudi Arabian
customs to the dangers of snake bites in the desert.
   The newscast carried at the top of the hour is the AP Network
News.
   The radio is on the air 24 hours a day, with a feed from the
broadcast center in Sun Valley, Calif., when the team in Saudi
Arabia is not working.
   They named their two trailers Camp Schmooz because Pon was
always accusing them of ``schmoozing,'' Yiddish slang for standing
around gossiping.
   The armed forces has 12 transmitters set up in Saudi Arabia.
Three have a reach of over 30 miles, but the rest just reach three
or four miles.
   About 80 percent of the estimated 200,000 troops deployed in
Saudi Arabia should be able to hear it if they have radios.
   More transmitters are due in, along with 30,000 radios for the
troops. Several thousand radios have been distributed so far.
   The radio takes requests from the troops.
   The first request from a soldier came from a woman named Kim,
dedicating Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' to her fellow
troops.

   People sending mail to the newly united
Germany need to use care to avoid confusion in the addresses, the
U.S. Postal Service reports.
   The problem arises because similar systems of postal codes were
used in the former East and West Germanys.
   Until a new system can be developed, the codes for locations
formerly in West Germany should be preceded by the letter W (for
west), and for those formerly in East Germany by the letter O. Ost
is the German word for east.
   For example, addresses might include the line ``W-5300 Bonn'' or
``O-7010 Leipzig.''
   In either case, the country name to use is Federal Republic of
Germany.

   So, I think tha need a little time to calm
things down, cool things off, and let's try to go forward. I think
it's my responst - but also youibility to say, ``Look, it's not easy. All
of us
have had to compromise. Now let's move the country forward to what
really everybody wants, and that is getting these deficits under
control.'' Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, getting back to the lack of support from
Republicans, tomorrow you're going to be campaigning in North
Carolina for Senator Jesse Helms, who was one of your opponents on
the budget. What is your message to the voters? Vote blindly
Republican or vote for legislators who support your policies?
   A: If we had more people on fiscal policy like Jesse Helms, and
by that I mean control of the Senate, we wouldn't be in this mess.
People would have been doing it more the way I want it done. So I
can't confiport. But I guess I
learned that I can't do it exactly my way when we get down on
something like the deficit. I do think internationally the support
is still very, very strong.
   So when you get into somebody's pocketbook or you get worrying
about a tax or a spending cut that affects someone, I've learned
that it's just not going to be done the way I want it, especially
if you don't control the Senate or you don't control the House. So
I can't worry too much about it. I just have to try to get this
process moved forward, and that's what we've done. I've had to
compromise, but I think it will come it out all right. Yeah?
   Q: If I might, I wonder if you think, though, that you're paying
the price now in asking the American people to sacrifice, and
having them rebuff it the way it happened - paying the price for
all these years in the Reagan-Bush administration that you sold
supply-side economics?
   A: No, I don't think so. I think that when you see Democratic
votes against the leadership, we're talking about something a
little shorter-term here. I think you're looking at something that,
when people have analyzed a package, and don't like parts of it,
because they're still saying, ``Hey, we like -- we want you to vote
for the overall package.'' So the problem comes from some specific
part of the package. That's the way I analyze it. Yeah, John?

   President Bush signed emergency legislation
today restoring business as usual for the federal government, and
said he was willing to raise income tax rates on wealthy Americans
if a final budget included his long-sought cut in the capital gains
tax.
   Bush said he would do ``everything in my power'' to see that
Congress follows up in the next few days with a five-year plan to
cut the deficit by $500 billion.
   Federal workers breathed a collective sigh of relief that there
would be no forced furloughs. The government, closed over the
holiday weekend due to the budget impasse, had faced the prospect
of a shutdown of non-essential services today without an agreement.
   The president met with reporters as lawmakers, exhausted after a
string of late-night sessions, were returning to the work of
deciding precisely which spending programs to cut and whose taxes
to raise.
   Under Monday's late-night agreement between the White House and
Congress, that work must be completed by Oct. 19 - or the
government faces the risk of yet another shutdown in services.
   The budget crisis erupted last week when the House rejected a
bipartisan plan that called for $134 billion in tax increases and a
wide array of military and program spending cuts. Increases in
Medicare fees were rolled back slightly and an alternative plan has
been approved, although it contains fewer specifics than the one
that was rejected.
   Democrats have complained the budget plans have been unfairly
weighted against the middle income taxpayers to the benfit of
wealthier Americans, and Bush's remarks indicated that the final
tax package is still in negotiation. One subject: the ``bubble'' by
which some taxpayers pay a 33 percent rate rather than the 28
percent rate applied to the wealthiest taxpayers.
   Asked about the possibility of raising tax rates on the wealthy,
Bush said: ``That's on the table. That's been talked about. And if
it's proper, if it can be worked in proper balance between the
capital gains rate and income tax changes, fine.''
   It was the first time Bush has state explicitly he could go
along with a hike in income tax rates. His opposition to changing
the rate structure had been the last remnant of another campaign
pledge: ``no new taxes''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was
heartened by Bush's statement.
   ``I have personally advocated (an increased tax rate) on those
making more than $200,000 a year for some time,'' he said. ``And
I'm pleased that the president has now come around, or apparently
come around, to our point of view and to recognize the fairness o
fsuch a change.''
   ``The action is in the Congress, but we'll work with them'' on
filling in the gaping blanks in the deficit-cutting agreement, Bush
said ``I will do everything in my power to encourage Congress as it
struggles to bring forth the most comprehensive and signficiant
deficit cutting plan ever.''
   The president took pains to defend his top aides for their help
in the budget confrontation with Congress. White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman have come in
for criticism from Republicans and Democrats, who accuse them of
high-handed tactics.
   ``When passions get high, there's bound to be a little broken
china,'' Bush said. ``They did an outstanding job,'' he said of his
negotiators, dismissing critical comments from ``squeaky wheels''
on Capitol Hill.
   Bush signed the emergency spending legislation shortly after 7
a.m.
   The House gave final congressional approval to the emergency
funding legislation on a 362-3 vote at 1:45 a.m. The Senate passed
it on a voice vote. The long-term deficit reduction plan was passed
Monday 250-164 by the House and ratified by the Senate early this
morning on 66-33 vote.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said today
that ``our task now is to enforce the budget resolution that was
passed.''
   ``It's going to be tough, and it's going to be hard to vote
for,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``Next week will be very intense,'' said House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   By his comments on taxes, Bush signalled a willingness to
compromise on one of the most fiercely fought issues in the budget
confrontation.
   The president has been seeking a cut in the capital gains tax
since before his election in 1988. Democrats in Congress have
blocked his effort last year, and have said that any cut must be
accompanied by an increase in tax rates on the wealthy.
   Capital gains come from money made from the sale of stocks, real
estate, and other assets.
   Democrats, meantime, targeted for elimination a quirk in the
federal tax system where the marginal tax rate goes as high as 33
percent for upper-middle-income but then drops back to 28 percent
at hiher incomes. The pattern has become known as the ``bubble.''
   With Congress and the White House looking for ways to raise
revenue to reduce the federal deficit, talk of trading the
``bubble'' for capital gains has increased. Bush said he would be
willing to negotiate the bubble ``at some level, sure.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Monday he expected
such a proposal to be made as Congress considers legislation
enacting its five year, $500 billion deficit reduction plan.
   Even if both sides agree a trade can be made, there could be
tough battles over just how much to cut the capital gains rate and
raise the income tax rate.
   Bush's decision to sign the emergency spending bill marked a
pause in several days of confrontation with Congress.
   The House on Friday rejected a compromise package Bush had
pitched on television. Legislators in both parties objected to
proposals such as a 12-cent increase in gasoline taxes and higher
Medicare deductibles and fees.
   The president then vetoed an attempt by Congress to keep the
government open while the plan was revised. As a result, sites such
as the Washington Monument, the Statue of Liberty, Yosemite and
other weekend government services were stopped.
   The long-term budget plan is a broad outline of taxes and
spending restraints that are similar in scope - but without the
detail - of the budget pact between Bush and congressional leaders
the House killed last week.
   But the outline is a document that is supposed to provide the
shape of legislation to follow imposing specific taxes and spending
restraints. That includes things items as alcohol taxes, increased
Medicare premiums and cuts in farm subsidies that are seen as
needed to produce the mandated savings, including $40 billion in
the current fiscal year.
   The emergency spending bill also included a temporary increase
in the national debt, to $3.195 trillion, needed to prevent a
default by the Treasury.
   The three House members voting against the legislation today
were: William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Philip Crane, R-Ill.; and Pat
Williams, D-Mont.

   When Ben Jones left his acting career for
politics two years ago, he quickly became a darling of the
Democrats in Congress.
   Now the folksy House freshman, who played Cooter on TV's ``Dukes
of Hazzard,'' is in a fight for his political life.
   The Georgia Democrat is up against veteran state Rep. John
Linder in a race the national GOP has placed on its top 10 ``hit
list.'' Linder, a wealthy businessman, portrays his campaign as a
fight against a liberal ``just a little left of Michael Dukakis.''
   Jones casts himself as a mainstream congressman who votes his
conscience. He supports abortion rights, environmental issues and
gun control legislation.
   His celebrity status makes him a popular attraction at the
fund-raisers of fellow Democrats and he has won praise for speaking
out on tough issues. For example, he was a vocal opponent of a
proposed ban on flag burning.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., calls Jones ``probably the
most highly regarded'' freshman House member.
   Jones ``takes the positions he thinks are right,'' Foley said at
a fund-raiser in August. ``He doesn't go out and take a poll first.
If it feels right to him ... he takes that position come hell or
high water.''
   This year's campaign is a far cry from 1988, when Jones ousted
Republican Rep. Pat Swindall in what was one of the dirtiest
campaigns in the nation.
   Swindall, who was indicted for perjury 22 days before the
election, characterized Jones as an alcoholic wife-beater. Jones
admitted to ``wild'' behavior and a misdemeanor assault conviction
for shoving his wife in a bar, but said his drinking problems were
behind him.
   In this year's contest, the two candidates have clashed mainly
on patriotism.
   Jones led the controversial effort last summer to defeat an
constitutional
   amendment that would prohibit flag burning, saying it would be
overreacting to a ``handful of malcontents.''
   Linder went on the offensive, announcing he supported the
amendment and criticizing Jones' call for display of American flags
in support of U.S. troops in the Middle East as hypocritical.
   Jones retaliated by saying that Linder didn't support veterans
in the Legislature and skippe  meetings of the Defense and Veterans
Affairs committees.
   Linder emphasizes the two years he served in the Air Force as a
dentist and notes his brother is serving in Saudi Arabia. And he
says the media made more out of the flag-burning issue that he did.
   ``The one thing voters hate worse than a flag burner is someone
who wraps themselves in the flag,'' Linder said. ``Do I question
his patriotism? That's a bunch of bull. But it does come up when I
address veterans' groups.
   ``It's just one of a series of issues we think definitely place
him a little to the left of Michael Dukakis,'' said Linder.
   Linder also is focusing on the tax issue, blaming Democrats for
stalling the budget while pushing the country to the brink of
sweeping Gramm-Rudman cuts.
   He says the way to solve the budget crisis is to cut spending on
such programs such as farm subsidies, the National Endowment for
the Arts and large staffs and franking for congressmen.
   ``I've been a businessman for a long time. When businesses get
into trouble with declining revenues, they cut overhead. They lay
off people, give others early retirement,'' Linder said. ``They
don't go to their neighbors and say give us more money.''
   Both candidates support a reduction in the capital gains tax.
   Linder has been busy canvassing neighborhoods in the district's
east Atlanta suburbs. The district is one of the most highly
educated and culturally sophisticated in the South, but it has no
clear political party preference.
   Jones has been in the district as often as four days a week
since his election. He impresses constituents by taking notes while
they talk to him.
   ``I married into a police family and I heard a lot about
old-time policing, where the community knows you and you know
them,'' Jones told a group of law enforcement officers. ``I try to
take that kind of old-fashioned attitude with me wherever I go,
even in the halls of Congress. If you know somebody, you can talk
to them.''

   In 1963, Sanders joined Ebony as an associate editor. He covered
the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. in Sweden in 1964 and opened the magazine's first overseas
bureau in Paris in 1965.
   For three years in Paris, Sanders also wrote a column, ``Paris
Scratchpad,'' for Ebony's sister magazine, Jet. He returned to
Ebony as managing editor.
   Sanders also served with comedian Bill Cosby as co-chairman of
the NAACP's Entertainment Committee for Life Members. He also was a
board member of the Gospel Music Workshop of America.
   Survivors include two sisters and a brother.
   Services were scheduled for Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Q: So you say you've learned that you just can't have things the
way you want it on the budget. But earlier this year, you raised
the stakes when you said the budget crisis would be the biggest
test domestically of your presidency. So far, have you failed the
test, given that fiasco of the ...
   A: Give me a couple weeks here. I want to see if we can't get
this deal through.
   Q: Well, do you think ...
   A: I thought we did pretty well when we got an agreement with
the Republican leadership and the House leadership, Democrat and
Republican. To me, that's getting something done. Now we couldn't
get it through the Congress yet, so we'll try again. So I think the
jury's still out on that, John.
   Q: Do you suddenly feel politically a bit more vulnerable now?
The Democrats smell blood. They're looking to '92 now. George Bush
has slipped. What do you think?
   A: Well, without referring to the polls, that I don't like to
refer to, have them take a look. Yeah, Ann?
   Q: Considering the movement to limit terms in Congress that has
been spreading around the country, would you support it either
because of your current problems with Congress or because of the
philosophy of term limitations?
   A: No, that was in the Republican platform. So I may go, go
public on that. I'm certainly not opposed to it. And so it was, I
haven't decided exactly. But I think there's, people want a change
against the incumbents up there on the Hill. And I think that, you
saw what happened in Oklahoma.
   I don't know what's going to happen. There's two of those state
- what do they call them? - on the ballot in - yeah, referendums -
on the ballot in California. Both of them are different, slightly,
in terms of how they are put into effect. But I expect they have a
good chance. And as I say, we are committed on our platform to some
limitation. But whether I make that a, a prime mover in the
political campaign that lies ahead in the next few weeks, I don't
know. But I will remind people that's in there.
   Q Mr. President?
   A: Yes.
   Q: Can we clarify something that we talked about earlier. Many
of the lawmakers say that the repudiation of the budget packet
reflects the fact that people feel that economic policy in this
country over the last 10 years was fundamentally unfair, that it
redistributed income too much to the wealthy and too little to the
poor. Do you think that that is part of the reason that yor
package was rejected?
   A: It might have been part of the reason, but I don't think the
entire reason, because I don't think that's why Republicans
rejected it at all.
   Q: Could you also clarify your statement on the bubble? You said
that ``it was talked about.'' Is that one of your positions, that
you would support ...
   A: At some level.
   Q: ... the top rate ...
   A: Sure, at some level.
   Q: What rate would you ...
   A: Well, as I've told you, I'm not going to try to negotiate it
here. I want to get something done in these committees. So what
we've got to do is get with the Senate leaders, House leaders, on
Finance and Ways and Means, and see if we can reach a formula. I
don't think it would be helpful to draw a line in the sand on what
percentage of the exclusion of capital gains, and then what on the
- what we'd give in terms of the leveling out the bubble or getting
rid of the bubble.
   Yes, Maureen, and then Charles and then Jim.
   Q: Mr. President, during the campaign, when you took the
position that you absolutely, positively would not raise taxes
under any circumstance. And then a lot of your fellow Republicans,
as you know, were encouraged to follow suit by taking this anti-tax
pledge, do you think that that now is part of the reason ...
   A: Yes.
   Q: ... that you're having so much trouble?
   A: I think that makes it more difficult for people.
   Q: Do you regret that you took that position?
   A: No, because what I do is take a look at, at the situation at
the time, see the changed economics, and say I've got to, got to,
you know, go forward here.
   Q: Except that the deficit was very large then, also.

   A: Well, I know, but I thought we could get into effect the
program that I ran on. I, we ran up against a lot of Democratic
opposition, sent a budget up that didn't gain the support we wanted
and have done that twice. So, but I think you raise a good point. I
think, and some have told me that when I was talking to them. Yeah,
Charles?
   Q: Mr. President, a question about the process, the budget now
being back in the hands of the congressional committees where it
was envisioned in the first place. Do you have second thoughts
about all this summitry that led up to this situation?
   A: No, I don't because what we did is to get a deal that I think
has support from the American people overall, and we've gotten out
a lot of the underbrush. We've moved out a lot of the debate and
moved it into a package that was supported by the president, by the
Republican and, leader in the House and the Senate, and by the
Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate.
   So I think it's, I think we've made some progress even though
obviously it didn't get through either house. But now we're going
to have to keep working this week. And some of the members who
would like to do it exactly his or her way are going to see that it
doesn't work quite that way. So I don't think it's been time wasted
at all.
   Q: Well how badly does it undercut you politically in terms of
some of the antagonism between your staff, your budget director,
your chief of staff, people on the Hill, and within the Republican
Party?
   A: I don't, I don't worry about that at all. I really don't. I
have been campaigning for and will continue to campaign for people
that might agree with me on this or might disagree with me on this.
And we have broad principles that unite us. And when people get
tired and stay up till three o'clock in the morning, every morning,
why there's bound to be tensions. Calm them, calm it down and try
to go forward. That's my approach to it. Jim?
   Q: Mr. President, yesterday Israeli forces used live ammunition
to put down a demonstration in Israel, killing 19 Palestinians.
Today, Saddam Hussein is using that incident in an attempt to rally
Arab support against Israel and especially against the United
States in the region. Do you think this incident could create a
crack in the alliance against Iraq? And what's your reaction to the
incident?
   A: Well, I don't think it could do that, but look, let me just
express my strong feelings about this. First my sorrow at this
tragedy.
   It is particularly saddening, given the sanctity of the holy
places and observances there, that violence shattered all of this.
And I want to echo what Jim Baker said earlier, that Israeli
security forces need to be better prepared for such situations,
need to act with greater restraint, particularly when it comes to
the use of deadly force. And at this point what is needed most of
all is calm on all sides.
   Let me - I do''t think I need to say this - but, let me just
state that we want to see the longstanding policy of maintaining
open access to the holy places preserved, tempered only by mutual
respect for people of other faiths. And so I am very, very saddened
by this needless loss of life, and I would call on all for
restraint. The action will shift to the United Nations now.
   To your other part of the question, Jim, there's no relationship
here. Saddam Hussein is trying to, from the very beginning, justify
the illegal invasion of Kuwait by trying to tie it in to the
Palestine question. And that is not working. The Arab world is
united - almost united - against him. And I don't think if he tries
now to use this unfortunate incident to link the two questions, I
don't think that will be successful. And certainly, I will be doing
what I can to see that it is not successful.
   Having said that, I hope nobody questions our interest in seeing
a solution to the Palestine question, to the implementation of the
Security Council resolutions. And that's what Jim Baker has been
working so hard on for such a long time. But let's separate out
this violence and say, we deplore it, and it must not happen. And
regret it, the loss of life for everybody.

   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that says public schools that allow civic groups and others to rent
school space can't refuse such access to religious organizations.
   The justices, without comment, rejected the appeal of a
Pennsylvania high school forced to rent weekend use of its
auditorium to the Campus Crusade for Christ.
   The action was announced the day David H. Souter became
history's 105th justice, but he did not participate in the case.
   Souter was sworn in a brief courtroom ceremony before all nine
justices took the bench to issue orders in new cases and hear
arguments in cases to be decided by July.
   In another case involving religion, the court rejected an appeal
by a small fundamentalist church in Evanston, Ill., that blamed its
trouble finding a permanent home on a local zoning ordinance.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive Love Church's
challenge to the city ordinance.
   In a third case, the court turned down the appeal of a Seattle
church that says King County should have to pay it for blocking the
use of church-owned land. It left intact a Washington Supreme Court
ruling that a lawsuit filed against the county by the Presbytery of
Seattle was premature.
   In other cases, the court:
   -Let stand a ruling that the constitutional rights of an
emotionally disturbed Texas boy allegedly beaten by his school
principal were not violated.
   Ronald and Nancy Fee, said Joseph Herndon brutally beat their
12-year-old son when he refused to submit to being paddled three
times for misbehaving in class. Herndon and a teacher who was
present said the boy was paddled three times on the buttocks and
that injuries he suffered were caused by his thrashing about on the
floor as he sought to avoid the paddling.
   -Revived a $4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire inventor Arthur
Jones, who says ABC-TV's ``20-20'' program falsely portrayed him as
a liar and hypocrite.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy the libel
suit filed after a 1987 report on the fate of 63 baby elephants
Jones rescued from death in Africa. Jones invented the Nautilus
exercise machines.
   The justices said the case should be reconsidered in light of
their June ruling that the Constitution's guarantee of free speech
did not ``create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that
might be labeled opinion.''
   -Agreed to decide in a Florida case whether police may conduct
random drug searches aboard buses and trains after passengers have
consented. Florida officials say the searches are necessary because
the state is a pipeline for drugs.
   In the Pennsylvania case involving the use of public school
facilities by religious group, the state court upheld the dismissal
of the suit. It said the church failed to exhaust its
administrative remedies because it never even applied for a
building permit.
   In June, the high court upheld the federal Equal Access Act, in
which Congress required that virtually all public high schools must
allow student prayer groups to meet and worship if other student
clubs are permitted at school.
   The court said then the law doesn't violate the constitutionally
required separation of church and state. But the federal law
applies only to student groups - not to outside organizations
seeking sue of school facilities.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the First
Amendment when it ruled last summer that Centennial, Pa., school
officials violated the free-speech rights of Student Venture, a
subsidiary of the Campus Crusade for Christ.
   The officials refused to rent space for a William Tennent High
School program aimed at religious conversion.
   By a 2-1 vote, the appeals court said the school district had
created an ``open public forum'' by renting space to, among others,
the local Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, an adult education program and
two labor unions.
   The appeals court said religious groups could not be excluded
from such an open forum because of their message.
   The school district's lawyers said schools nationwide let
various community groups use school property when classes are in
session, and that the appeals court ruling means such use has
``converted most American public school facilities into open public
forums, to which even the most fractious religious and political
speakers must be routinely allowed access.''
   The three cases involving religion were: Centennial School
District vs. Gregoire, 90-304; Love Church vs. Evanston, 90-296;
and Presbytery of Seattle vs. King County, 90-298.

<HEAD>Israeli On Trial Again for Meeting Arafat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAMLE, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace activist Abie Nathan went on trial
Tuesday on charges he met twice this year with PLO leader Yasser
Arafat in violation of Israel's anti-terrorism law.
   Nathan was convicted last year for a 1988 meeting with Arafat
and served four months of a six-month prison sentence before he was
released for good behavior.
   Nathan acknowledged in Ramle's Magistrates Court Tuesday that he
met the Palestine Liberation Organization leader twice in March in
Tunisia. But he pleaded innocent, maintaining the law under which
he was charged was unjust.
   Israel considers the PLO to be a terrorist organization, and a
1986 amendment to Israel's anti-terror law makes meetings with PLO
leaers punishable by jail terms of up to three years.
   Court officials said Nathan faces up to seven years in jail -
three for each alleged violation and an additional year that was
``suspended'' in the earlier case.
   Nathan told reporters after the session that he was ready to
return to jail.
   ``I am prepared to give my whole life for peace,'' Nathan said.
``I will continue to fight against this unjust law because it is a
law you cannot accept.''
   Nathan, 64, first met Arafat in 1982 when he went to Lebanon
during the Israeli siege of Beirut in an unsuccessful attempt to
gain freedom for a captured Israeli soldier. He has met him eight
times since.
   He is best known for making a dramatic trip in a private plane
to Cairo in 1966 to try to convince Egypt to make peace with
Israel. His pirate radio station, the Voice of Peace, operates from
a ship in the Mediterranean Sea.

   Q: Also, a follow, please. Saddam Hussein also indicated today
that the Iraqis have a new sort of missile that can reach into
Israel and reach the U.S. troops. And he's threatening to use that
force.
   A: I noticed that and I notice he's getting a little more
bellicose. Once in a while you see a conciliatory statement, and
then you hear a lot of heightened rhetoric about what he is going
to do and what he's not going to do. Now I'm satisfied that we can
defend our interests now. And I am satisfied that, that these
threats of his are counter-productive in terms of solving any
peaceful resolution of the question. They don't help a thing, they
just polarize.
   So, you don't want to overreact to it. I keep reading statements
like this, ever since this illegal annexation, illegal aggression
took place. There's no - not too good a pattern. We watch it very
carefully, and it's pretty hard to detect a pattern. Now, there's a
theme, and that is trying to link the Palestine question into his,
kind of giving justification for what he did against Kuwait, and
yet the logic falls totally flat. Yes, Frank?
   Q: Mr. President, on that subject, you said the action now
shifts on this one to the United Nations. Having just been to the
United Nations and talked about its increased relevance and role,
how far are you prepared to go as far as the United States is
concerned in meeting some of the Arab efforts to partially condemn
Israel's action and pass a resolution that ...
   A: Well, I think it all depends what the resolution is, and so
that's just starting up there now and we're not sure exactly what
direction it all will take. So I'd want to stop short of saying
exactly what I could, you know, what the U.S. government could
support or what it couldn't support.
   Q If I may, sir, on a related topic, when the emir of Kuwait was
here, you expressed grave concern about the dismantling of Kuwait.
   A: Yes, I did.
   Q: Your advisers said that that could affect the timetable for
permitting sanctions to work. What is your feeling on that now? Is
the dismantling ...
   A: I thought General Scowcroft put it very well after the emir
left here. And I am very much concerned, not just about this
physical dismantling, but of the brutality that has now been
written on by Amnesty International confirming some of the tales
told us by the emir. Of brutality and, oh, it's just unbelievable,
some of the things at least he reflected. I mean, people on a
dialysis machine cut off, the machine sent to Baghdad; people in
babies in incubators heaved out of the incubators and the
incubators themselves sent to Baghdad.
   Now, I don't know how many of these tales can be authenticated,
but I do know that when the emir was here he was speaking from the
heart. And after that came the Amnesty International, who were
debriefing many of the people at the border. And it's sickening.
   And so I - if your question was how long, I can't give you an
answer in days or months. But it is a matter that, it's a new
equation in the last three weeks, the systematic dismantling of
Kuwait that concerns us enormously. And I think the more people
understand it, the more Saddam Hussein will be condemned. But I
have to stop short of telling you what that, where that leads me
to, in terms of recommending action by the allied forces there.
   Q: It does sound like your patience is wearing thin on the
sanctions.
   A: It's wearing very thin on that account, yes.
   Q: Mr. President, a couple of minutes ago, you said that public
opinion seemed to support your handling of foreign affairs better
than domestic affairs. Why do you think that you're so much more
comfortable with and better at foreign matters than domestic? To
some people, it seems like almost two presidents.
   A: Well, I've read that sophisticated analysis, and I'm
troubled, because I don't the, I don't really know the answer to
it. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that in one, I think the
Vandenburg theory applies. People really basically want to support
the president on foreign affairs, and partisanship does, in a
sense, stop at the water's edge. Whereas on domestic policy, here I
am with Democratic majorities in the Senate and Democratic
majorities in the House, having to try to persuade them to do what
I think is best. And it's complicated.

   Robbers trapped an armored car between a
stolen garbage truck and stolen bulldozer Tuesday and shot all
three guards, killing one, but fled empty-handed, police said.
   It was the fourth fatal attack this year on security company
guards transporting funds. Three men were killed in two separate
attacks on armored cars, and two guards on foot were shot dead
while delivering money to a bank.
   The latest attack occurred about in Lentilly, six miles
northwest of Lyon.
   The armored car, owned by the Transval security company,
encountered a garbage truck blocking a narrow street, police said.
The car then was struck in the rear by a stolen bulldozer and
smashed into the garbage truck, according to police.
   The robbers opened fire, fatally wounding Henri Marion, 57, and
seriously injuring the two other guards, police said. But
investigators said the robbers apparently were unable to open the
safe in the vehicle, and decided to flee in a stolen car.
   In Paris, union leaders representing employees of security
companies urged guards to launch a strike to demand a risk bonus
and better safety arrangements.

<HEAD>Saddam Claims Iraq Has Developed a New Missile</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 25 grafs with more quotes from Saddam, comment from
weapons analyst, editing to conform. Picks up 18th graf pvs ``He

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said today Iraq has developed a new
missile with a range of several hundred miles. Such a weapon would
allow Iraq to strike deep into Saudi Arabia where tens of thousands
of American troops are deployed.
   The new missile is called the al-Hijara, or Stone, apparently
named to honor young Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip who are confronting the Israelis with stones.
   The killings of 19 Palestinians by Israeli police at the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem on Monday brings Israel ``closer to the abyss,''
Saddam said in a statement read by an announcer over state-run
Baghdad Radio.
   Addressing Israel, he said: ``The faithful Palestinians faced up
to you ... with stones which no power on earth can withhold from
those who wish to use them.''
   It was not possible to obtain independent verification of
Saddam's claim to have developed a new missile. But Don Kerr, a
weapons analyst at London's International Institute for Strategic
Studies, said such a claim would not be extraordinary.
   ``Iraq has had considerable success with surface-to-surface
missiles, mostly derivatives of the Soviet-made Scud,'' Kerr said
by telephone.
   Iraq's al-Hussein missile has a range of 310-370 miles and the
al-Abbas missile a range of 500-560 miles, Kerr said. Both carry
conventional high-explosive warheads.
   Saddam, who has linked a withdrawal from occupied Kuwait with an
Israeli pillout from Arab territory captured in 1967, appeared to
seeking to exploit Monday's violence in Jerusalem to build support
for his invasion of Kuwait.
   The Palestinians, along with many other Arabs in Jordan, Sudan,
Yemen and Algeria, are among Saddam's staunchest supporters.
   Also today, rock 'n' roll music boomed out across the Saudi
desert when U.S. armed forces radio began broadcasting live for the
nearly 200,000 U.S. troops.
   ``It's 9:05 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 9. Goooood Maaaaawrning Saudi
Arabia,'' bellowed disk jockey Rich Yanku, echoing the famous
character played by comedian Robin Williams in the movie about
Armed Forces Radio in Vietnam.
   The Navy, meanwhile, searched for eight Marines whose two
helicopters disappeared Monday over the North Arabian Sea during a
training exercise. Rescue teams have located debris from one of the
aircraft, but no bodies.
   Two American airmen who had volunteered for duty in the Persian
Gulf crisis died in a jet crash Monday in Saudi Arabia.
   In other developments:
   -A study published this week said Iraq should be able to survive
the U.N. trade embargo for at least another six months. The report,
by The Economist, a financial magazine published in London, said
that since the West is not likely to wait that long, a military
strike against Iraq seemed inevitable.
   -A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad said that a U.S.-chartered
Iraqi jetliner on Wednesday will evacuate about 350 more Americans
and an unknown number of other foreigners from Kuwait.
   -The killings at the Temple Mount set off a barrage of Arab
warnings and threats. Some Israeli opponents said the incident,
which occurred when police fired on stone-throwers at a holy site,
demonstrated the link between the gulf crisis and the
Israelie-occupied lands.
   The gulf crisis began after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Since
then, the Iraqis have massed close to 500,000 soldiers in Kuwait.
The United States leads a multinational force that includes nearly
200,000 U.S. soldiers deployed in Saudi Arabia and the region to
deter any further aggression.
   Saddam described Iraq's new missile in a statement monitored in
Nicosia.
   ``Al-Hijara became capable of reaching targets that are hundreds
of kilometers (miles) from where it is launched,'' the statement
said.
   ``They are the new missiles which Iraq invented,'' it said. ``It
is capable of reaching its targets from where it is launched, and
there are many al-Hijaras in Iraq.''
   The statement did not give details on the number of missiles
Iraq possesses or what kind of warhead it can carry.
   Also today, a spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
there was reason to be upbeat about prospects for a settlement to
the Persian Gulf crisis following a visit to Iraq by a Soviet
envoy.
   Presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko expressed optimism for a
settlement in the gulf crisis following Friday's meeting between
Saddam and Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov.
   Ignatenko would not give details in Moscow but said Gorbachev
would inform President Bush by letter of the latest Soviet efforts.
``I can only tell you that we are today more able to look more
optimistically at the prospect of a political settlement in that
region,'' Ignatenko said in Moscow.
   He said details would become known ``within one or two weeks.''
   Saddam has suggested that if negotiations are held to solve the
crisis, that all regional conflicts, including the Palestinian
uprising in Israel's occupied lands, also be placed on the agenda.
   In one of the military accidents Monday, an RF4C Phantom
reconnaisance jet crashed in the southern Saudi Arabian peninsula.
The jet belonged to a unit of the Alabama Air National Guard on a
training mission, the guard said.
   It identified the victims as Maj. Barry K. Henderson, 40, a
senior pilot from Tuscumbia, Ala., and Maj. Stephen G. Schramm, 43,
a master navigator from Birmingham, Ala.
   Both were assigned to the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron
of the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and had volunteered for
duty, military officials said. Their unit had not been activated.
   The Marine helicopters vanished over the North Arabian Sea on
Monday while on a training mission and the search for them
continued today.

<HEAD>India Discloses Expulsion Of Four Pakistani Embassy Personnel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India quietly expelled four Pakistani
embassy personnel earlier this year for alleged spying, a Foreign
Ministry statement said Tuesday.
   The statement said Pakistan was retaliating for the previously
unanounced expulsion when it demanded Monday that four Indian
officials be recalled from the consulate in Karachi.
   It said the Pakistani press, in ``obviously inspired'' reports,
suggested in advance that the expulsion of the Indians was
imminent, and linked it to the expulsion is from
the High Commission in New Delhi between March and August.
   The statement confirmedof four Pakistan these reports and said the
four were
asked to leave ``on account of their proven espionage activities in
India.''
   India previously had not made the expulsions public.
   ``It was done quietly, one by one,'' said a Foreign Ministry
official. He gave no explanation, and said he did not have the
names of the Pakistani officials or whether they were diplomats.
   The statement said ``the government categorically rejects''
allegations by Pakistan that the Indian consulate officials were
engaged in security offenses.
   The officials were told to leave the southern port city of
Karachi within 10 days.
   ``Pakistan's action can hardly be calculated to restore
confidence in relations between our two countries,'' le program
violates campaign finance laws. The committee is allowed to donate
$17,500 directly to Senate candidates and may spend an additional
amount on a candidate's behalf. The limit on the size of the latter
contributions varies from state to state depending on population.
   The Common Cause and DSCC complaints allege the Republicans are
using the Inner Circle campaign to circumvent the limits by
``bundling'' contributions it raises from the direct-mail Inner
Circle program and donating the money to certain GOP Senate
candidates.
   In its Inner Circle fund-raising solicitation, the NRSC says it
will serve as a conduit and channel the money to Republican Senate
candidates. The NRSC contends these donations do apply against its
contribution limits because the money never enters NRSC accounts.
   The Common Cause complaint asserts that the NRSC is too loosely
interpreting federal election laws. It says the GOP organization
cannot claim to be simply a conduit because it ``selected, or
played a major role in selecting, which campaigns would receive the
proceeds.''
   Common Cause won an earlier lawsuit challenging a 1986
``bundling'' program run by the NRSC.

<HEAD>Tax Increase Aimed at Stamping Out Tobacco in Marlboro Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM LACEKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in the heart of ``Marlboro Country''
will decide whether to make their state cigarette tax the highest
in the nation to discourage smoking and fund anti-tobacco
education.
   Both sides agree that the real goal of Initiative 115 is to
reduce, even eliminate, the use of tobacco in Montana.
   ``No question,'' said Dr. Robert M. Shepherd, a Helena physician
who is treasurer and chief spokesman for the initiative. ``I think
that would do more for the health of the population here than
anything else we could do.''
   Jerome Anderson, a Helena attorney and tobacco lobbyist,
complains the proposal on the Nov. 6 ballot would use taxes ``to
establish social mores.''
   ``We feel this is not the intended use of taxation,'' he said.
   The initiative would raise Montana's cigarette tax 140 percent
from 18 cents a pack to 43 cents, and double the tax on other
tobacco products to 25 percent of the wholesale price. It would
take effect July 1.
   Texas currently has the highest state cigarette tax: 41 cents a
pack, according to the Tobacco Institute in Washington, D.C.
   Congress also is considering hiking cigarette taxes nationwide
four cents in 1991, to 20 cents a pack, and to 24 cents in 1993 to
help balance the federal budget.
   Estimates on how much the proposed Montana tax would produce
range from $27.6 million to $34 million. The initiative would
assign 58 percent of that money to a new tobacco education and
preventive health-care fund. The rest would go to long-range
building accounts, which are financed by the current tobacco tax.
   Backers of the initiative gathered 18,351 signatures, but have
raised only about $20,000 to campaign for it. The American Cancer
Society gave $9,435, the American Lung Association donated $1,500,
and the American Heart Association had kicked in $7,500 in late
September, with the rest coming from small individual contributors.
   The tobacco industry, meanwhile, has poured more than $600,000
into the state to defeat it - about $2 for every likely vote. That
included contributions of $267,000 from R.J. Reynolds and $103,000
from Philip Morris.
   The I-115 sponsor, the Coalition for a Healthy Montana, is
depending mainly on news conferences and free public-service
announcements on radio and television to deliver its message.
   ``The message is that smoking is the No. 1 killer in the United
States, and it's costing us a lot of money,'' Shepherd said.
   Smoking, says Shepherd, is a major cause of cancer, heart
disease, stroke, emphysema, bronchitis, miscarriages and even house
fires. It will kill 1,500 Montanans this year and will cost the
state $265 million, or $330 for every Montana resident, he says.
   Anderson dismisses the health questions: ``You can prove
anything with statistics.''
   The real issue, Anderson argues, is that a tax increase for any
purpose is still a tax increase. And he says the additional tax
money would create a new bureaucracy with hundreds of new
government workers - a tobacco education and preventive health-care
fund in the state Health Department.
   Shepherd contends the higher tax would reduce consumption, most
notably among teen-agers. Anderson says it would only drive many
buyers to Montana's seven Indian reservations, where cigarettes are
exempt from state taxes.

<TEXT>
   I mean, I think that's part of it. And, well, I don't want to
get stretched out on the couch too far in terms of analysis now.
But, you know, when you get a problem with the complexities that
one, that the Middle East has now, and the Gulf has now, I enjoy
trying to keep this, put the coalition together and keep it
together and work towards what I think is a proper end, seeing that
this aggression doesn't succeed.
   I'm, I can't say I just rejoice every time I go up and talk to
Danny Rostenkowski, my dear friend, about what he's going to do on
taxes. I mean, it's just, does that help you?
   Q: Not ...
   A: That's about - have you got a follow-up?
   Q: It doesn't sound like you have as much fun as you do with the
other.
   A: That's about right, yeah. Yes, Ellen?
   Marlin Fitzwater: Final question, please.
   Q: Mr. President, you pulled out all the stops on this budget
deal, and it just flopped. Are you concerned, sir, that your
leadership on other domestic issues now will be eroded since you
didn't carry even half your own party in the House? You talk about
clean air, you talk about crime. Are you worried that you're just
going to - the honeymoon is entirely over?
   A: No, because I want to talk to Speaker Foley about this, and
Leader Mitchell, because they pulled out all the stops and they
didn't get the votes they needed. And so I don't think they feel
that they can't conduct their business in the House or in the
Senate, and certainly I don't feel that I can't conduct my business
here.
   So I don't think there is erosion. In fact, you saw the House
side come together in terms of a veto, right quick, like that. And
I think that, that's, you know - there's a certain maturity there,
and we go on to the next event. I mean, and stay with it. You
can't, can't stay there forever and mope about it. So I don't, no,
I don't worry about that.
   Q: But in terms of the disdain up on the Hill from both
Republicans and Democrats for some members of your staff, some of
them in this room, have you taken any of your staff to the
woodshed, sir?
   A: Absolutely not. I have full confidence in him, and when the
passions get high, I understand that there is bound to be a little
broken china up there. But, hey, look, If I got outraged every time
I watched C-SPAN and heard some outrageous Democrat go after me,
and I sulked about it, and I fretted about it, and I called Tom
Foley about it and said, said, ``Why do you permit this?'' And, you
know, I, I wouldn't be able to do anything. So I don't worry about
that.
   And in terms of my team, they did an outstanding job and I have
had more members tell me that. And so what you hear is the
squeaking wheel. You hear those that don't, aren't particularly
happy. Maybe you didn't get it exactly their way. And the news, of
course, is ``Man Bites Dog - Republican Goes After Republican.'' So
I don't, I don't think we've got a problem at all. We've got three
bright people working hard to move this, move my objectives forward
and I think they happen to be the country's objectives forward.
   Q: Who, sir, are these members of Congress who are hailing the
work of your team?
   A: Plenty of them. Go talk to the leadership. Talk to Bob
Michel. Talk to Bob Dole. They're the leaders. They're the key
leaders of the Congress. You want to talk about a squeaking wheel
from time to time, and I want to talk about those that have a
broader view of things. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President ...
   A: You've got two more. One, two, and that's the second. That's
where we counted the votes on the deal. Go ahead.
   Q: Following on Helen's question, do you think anyone on your
staff, or do you think that in general, without naming names which
I am certain you won't want to do in any case, didn't the White
House end of this handle anything wrong? Is it all ...
   A: I probably made some mistakes and I thought frankly that we
had a deal that would get support on the, from a majority of the
Republicans and I tried very hard. I made, golly, I can't remember
how many phone calls, and so I think there is you know, if we're
trying to assign blame, lay it right here.

   George Strait's path is clear.
   From Entertainer of the Year, to North Dakota, to Kansas and
then back to the ranch. That's where music business success is
leading the soft-speaking, hard-singing Texan.
   Backstage Monday night at the Country Music Association's awards
ceremony, Strait smiled from under his black hat and talked about
how it's been.
   ``It's hard not to be affected by this stuff. It's great,'' said
Strait, who won the CMA's top award the second consecutive year.
   Strait, like most country acts, will tour small towns and cities
across the naton this winter.
   But Strait will stop after 80 or so appearances and return to
his ranch in early November. ``I made up my mind I wasn't going to
tour as much,'' said Strait, known outside the country industry for
his TV beer commercials.
   Members of the fast-rising group Kentucky HeadHunters figure two
awards means they won't have to cut their hair. Their locks were
longer than anyone's at the awards ceremony - except for Crystal
Gayle's.
   ``Does this mean we get to keep our hair?'' asked Greg Martin,
one of five HeadHunters taking home crystal trophies for Album of
the Year, ``Pickin' on Nashville,'' and for Vocal Group of the
Year.
   The only other double winner was Garth Brooks, with the Horizon
Award (for career development) and Music Video of the Year for
``The Dance.''
   Tennessee Ernie Ford was inducted into the Country Music Hall of
Fame, an honor that made the 71-year-old singer consider the youth
of some other winners.
   ``These people who performed tonight, I've got neckties older
than they are,'' Ford said on the nationally televised awards
presentation.
   Clint Black won Male Vocalist of the Year and Kathy Mattea won
top female vocalist honors.
   The Judds, Wynonna and mother Naomi, picked up Vocal Duo of the
Year award.
   Single of the Year went to Vince Gill for ``When I Call Your
Name.'' Vocal Event of the Year, for performers who do not normally
sing together, went to Lorrie Morgan and her late husband, Keith
Whitley.
   Song of the Year, a songwriter's award, was given to Jon Vezner
and Don Henry for ``Where've You Been.''
   Johnny Gimble received Musician of the Year award.

<HEAD>Japanese Diplomatic Missteps Blamed on Domestic Infighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two diplomatic embarrassments this week, both
linked to party leaders jostling for power, have strengthened the
view that Japan's political fractiousness at home often prevents
coherent policy abroad.
   The incidents concerned negotiations with the Soviet Union and
the two Koreas, highly sensitive affairs usually conducted by the
Foreign Ministry.
   In both cases, however, the talks were taken up independently by
powerful politicians without official posts. Their missteps
reinforced the criticism of Japanese government as a mass of
competing interests with no real center, analysts say.
   In addition, the unofficial talks may have undermined the
already weak stature of the prime minister's office. The post is
usually filled through a tenuous alliance between intra-party
factions in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   ``It's not easy to identify a sort of power center in the
Japanese system like you can in the United States,'' said Seiichiro
Takagi, an international relations expert at Saitama University.
   Perhaps the best-known critic of this tendency of Japanese
government is Dutch writer Karl Van Wolferen, whose opinions have
stirred considerable controversy here:
   ``The Japanese prime minister has less real power than any head
of government in the Western world, or in most countries of Asia,''
he wrote in his recent book, ``The Enigma of Japanese Power.''
   ``Tokyo evades foreign questions concerning Japan's global
political and economic intentions because there is no one with the
authority to answer them.''
   In one incident this week, lawmakers from the powerful party
faction led by Shintaro Abe said Soviet officials told them the
Soviet Union might compromise on a territorial dispute that has
kept the two nations from signing a World War II peace treaty,
according to Japanese news reports.
   Abe has been considered the heir apparent to Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu, who is a member of a weak Liberal Democratic Party
faction and is believed to have very shallow support within the
party.
   The Foreign Ministry cautiously welcomed the news Monday. Later
in Moscow, however, the Soviet Foreign Ministry denied it had made
any such offer and denounced the report as ``disinformation.''
   It was an embarrassment both for Abe and the government.
   ``It's a free country. We cannot control what private
individuals do,'' Foreign Minister Taizo Watanabe said Tuesday.
   But he commented pointedly, ``Issues related to the Soviet Union
should be conducted in government-to-government negotiations.''
   In the second incident, powerful Liberal Democrat Shin Kanemaru
was forced to apologize to South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
Monday for beginning dialogue with North Korea too quickly. South
Korea, the North's bitter rival, said it was surprised by the move.
   Kanemaru, a former deputy prime minister, led a delegation of
high-level Japanese governing and opposition party legislators who
signed a declaration with North Korea last month urging the two
countries to start talks on normalizing relations.
   Kanemaru told Roh the trip to the North had been organized by
political parties, not governments, and he was sorry for creating
``misunderstanding and controversy.''
   Analysts say unofficial emissaries often have been used by
Japan's rigidly conservative government to test new policies. If it
works, the policies can be taken up by the government. If not, the
move can be repudiated, as in Abe's case with the Soviet Union.
   And Kanemaru's opening with North Korea still has a good chance
of working, officials said.
   ``It's a kind of human trial balloon,'' said Robert Orr,
director of the Stanford Japan Center.
   But some critics say such methods are unsuited to long-term
foreign-policy planning, and prevent the possibility of reacting to
events with a unified voice.
   And too often, they are carried out by politicians with far more
experience in infighting than statesmanship.
   Japan can ill afford such mishaps as it gets pressed more and
more into a global leadership role, these critics say.
   ``It's just another indication of the weakness of the Kaifu
regime,'' said Orr.
   ``There are people in the Foreign Ministry who are delighted
with all this. It undercuts the politicians and reinforces the
reason why the bureaucracy should be in charge of foreign policy.''

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Test-Ban Treaties, Calls For Global Ban</HEAD>

   The Soviet parliament today ratified two
U.S.-Soviet treaties from the 1970s that place tight limits on
underground nuclear weapons testing by the superpowers.
   The lawmakers voted 347-0, with nine abstentions, to approve the
treaties and to appeal to world ``parliaments and social
organizations'' to seek a global ban on nuclear testing.
   In the same vote, the parliament referred to its international
and national security committees questions stemming from several
reservations about the treaties, which were also ratified last
month by the U.S. Senate.
   The treaties focus mainly on verification methods for arms
control agreements, and allow each country to maintain intrusive,
on-site monitoring equipment at three sites on each other's soil.
   U.S. Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, cautioned after the Senate
vote that the Soviets could use their monitoring equipment for
espionage and urged no inspections be allowed until security
procedures were tightened.
   Supporters say the new verification measures are likely to
become important precedents for more ambitious arms control
treaties.
   The treaties limit underground explosions to 150 kilotons or
less. They are a follow to the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, which
barred nuclear tests in the atmosphere, water and in space.
   The latest treaties were not ratified at first because
then-President Carter wanted a more comprehensive test ban.
   The Reagan administration did not think that adequate means
existed for verifying that the Soviets were not cheating.
   That issue was settled by the signing of a verification protocol
in June in Washington by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's press
conference Tuesday in the White House press room.
   President Bush: Let me just go with an opening statement, and
then I'll be glad to respond to questions. First, on the budget,
the committees of Congress now take up the arduous task of
implementing the budget resolution that they just passed. We've
been pulling and tugging at this framework agreement for nearly
five months, and it's been difficult because that whole underlying
problem is difficult.
   And we're trying to reduce the federal deficit by $500 billion
over the next five years - 40 billion of it in the first year. And
this would be the largest such cut in history. So while it's easy
to get caught up in the maneuvers and the counter-maneuvers of the
legislative process, I want to assure the American people this
morning that I will do everything in my power to encourage Congress
as it struggles to bring forth the most comprehensive and
significant deficit-cutting plan ever.
   This morning I outlined several conditions for a budget
reconciliationbill. As the committees of Congress begin to fill in
the blanks in determining how we raise the revenues and cut the
spending, we must be mindful not to let the hard-won goals of the
budget resolution dissipate or lose direction.
   The Budget Reconciliation Bill, due on October 12, must measure
up to the savings Congress has outlined, without smoke and mirrors,
with growth-oriented tax incentives, with process reform, with
enforceability, with bipartisan support, and with passages of both
Houses -- by both Houses of Congress by October 19th.
   These are the objectives that we fought for since the beginning
of the long budget struggle, but they're worthy of our effort. In
any undertaking of this size, there is bound to be anguish, and I
want to recognize the valiant federal work force that had to suffer
through some uncertainty of this period. On Saturday morning I said
we cannot have business as usual. But the Congress has finally
acted and we are back on course and there can be no letup in our
attention to detail and our commitment to purpose. We must fulfill
the requirements of the budget resolution. Now, I'd be glad to take
some questions.
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Yeah, Terry?
   Q: A week ago you asked Americans to help get a budget passed
and they gave you the back of the hand. Then, despite a government
shutdown, Congress still hasn't been able to produce a budget. How
can Americans fail to have anything except grave questions about,
the - your ability and that of Congress to govern?
   A: Well, I think there probably are some questions. I don't feel
the American people gave the back of the hand to the budget
agreement. If you look at the surveys that were carried in the
magazines and all of this, they show that, I think, more people
wanted the agreement than not. So we've just got to do a better job
of getting it through.
   But listen, I can understand the frustration. I feel it myself
at times. And when you have a government with one party controlling
the Congress, where the action is and where the action will remain
now for a while, and then you have a president of a different
party, nobody thought it would be easy, and it isn't. So I think
there is some frustration, but I notice that there was strong
support for the package. The problem was that you ask in individual
categories of the package, ``Oh, no, we don't want this, we don't
want that, we don't - '' you know, a lot of special interests. But
people seem to want the deal.
   I think the deal, though not keeping me happy in every way, was
a good one and I was proud to join with the Republican and
Democratic leaders in supporting that original budget agreement.
Now we've got some of the main ingredients of it, broad instruction
to these committees that were contained within the original
agreement, and let's see if the Congress can get moving and come up
with a deal that I can accept. And we'll be working with them.
We're not, I'm not up here to assign blame. Yeah, Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, no matter what you say, there was a lot of
feeling in the country that the package was not fair. Are you
willing to accept a higher tax rate for the wealthy, perhaps in
exchange for a capital gains cut, but even so, a higher tax rate?

<HEAD>WASHN: tax rate?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: I haven't seen great sentiment for raising people's income
tax rates, and I'm not for that. Now, during the budget process,
and this was little noted, there was discussion about getting
capital gains for straightening out the bubble, which means raising
some rates. We were quite open-minded, there was some negotiation.
So I'm not, let me say this, I - that's on the table, that's been
talked about. And if it's proper, if it can be worked in proper
balance between the capital gains rate and income tax changes,
fine.
   But I don't think it's fruitful here to negotiate the details,
or try to. What we've got to do is get up now with - particularly
Ways and Means and Finance, Danny Rostenkowski, Lloyd Bentsen, Bill
Archer, and Bob Packwood - and discuss with them quietly what we
can accept. I want them to know it. But I don't think I can stand
here and kind of negotiate or mandate exactly what will happen.
   Q: Sir, don't you think, though, the secrecy was an impediment?
It fell like a lead balloon. The senior citizens in this country do
not consider themselves a special interest; they're a quarter of
the population.
   A: Right.
   Q: People who drive to work 50 miles every day, or less,
certainly did consider it a hardship. So had you not negotiated
more in public, more public dialogue, more debate, don't you think
you would have been better off?
   A: Well, I don't know that any person who is opposed to raising
gasoline taxes would have been more inclined to accept them if it
had been more - the negotiations between Democrats and Republicans
on these committees had been done in public.
   But I think now the positions are clear, and what I want to do
is see us go forward now. I mean, those are all out there now, and
so let's - the committees know where the opposition's coming from.
But, Helen, the basic problem is this, nobody wants to do anything
in terms of where they're affected. I mean, they just don't want
that, and yet they want the deficit down, and that's what makes it
difficult. And that's why I was very pleased to see the agreement.
Everyone had to give a little bit. But we'll go back now and see if
we can't, in that spirit, get a deal by the 19th that I can sign.
Yeah, Brit?
   Q: Mr. President, House Republicans, by the end of last week,
were being accused of behaving like Democrats. There seemed to be
fairly deep divisions within their ranks. You didn't carry, you and
the leaders did not carry a majority of House Republicans on the
budget deal. What hope do you now have, and what reason do you have
for holding that hope that you can do that the next time on a
program that will, in effect, be written by the Democratic Party?
   A: Well, I see that - Brit, you only stated - if I could , I
don't want to be argumentative, but the Democrats didn't have their
troops behind them. They didn't have what they needed to get it
through. So it isn't just the Republicans. I think the hope is that
people see more clearly now that it isn't easy, and as people go to
go with their own alternatives now, they find that they can't get
the support.
   So we may, so I think what we'll end up doing is staying very
close to the agreement that I reached with the Republican and
Democratic leaders. The last couple of, few days have been like a
catharsis. There's been a clearing of the air. People out -
``Here's what I'd do; here's what I'd like to do'' - and then they
find, well, there's no votes to do exactly what they'd like to do.
So I think we just have to work the process now and hope that the
Congress will come up with a reasonable deal. The action is in the
Congress, I keep pointing out, but we'll work with them. Yes?
   Q: There seemed to be considerable bitter feeling among
Republicans towards some members of your team, who felt they had
been dealt with in a ham-handed or high-haned way. Has anything
been done to patch this up, sir, and have you talked to members
about that?
   A: Well, I've talked to the leaders, our leaders, Dole and
Michel and others, Bill Archer yesterday, over the weekend, Al
Simpson and others. But, you know, anytime you have a difficult
road like this, there's bound to be griping about it. I have total
confidence in our team. I think they did a first-class job, and I
don't think we would have ever gotten the agreement out if they
hadn't done a first-class job.

   Police closed the holy Temple Mount today and
fired tear gas after 200 Moslem worshipers tried to break through
the cordon. Jerusalem's 80-year-old chief Moslem cleric was
overcome by tear gas.
   The temporary closure came one day after riots on the Temple
Mount, Islam's third-holiest site, in which at least 19
Palestinians were killed and about 140 were wounded by police
gunfire.
   In an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem today, a Palestinian
stabbed two border policemen with a screwdriver. The attacker and
another Arab were shot and wounded, police said.
   Clashes between stone throwers and police also erupted in three
other Jerusalem Arab neighborhoods, and widespread protests were
reported in Israeli Arab towns where leaders called for a two-day
strike over the Temple Mount bloodshed.
   Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip
have demanded U.N. protection and announced a protest strike
beginning today, the start of the 36th month of the anti-Israeli
uprising in the territories seized during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Monday's violence forced the Palestinian question back toward
the top of the international agenda. It was the bloodiest clash in
Jerusalem since the 1967 war, and the highest single-day death toll
in the uprising.
   Arab leaders denounced the use of deadly force by Israel.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, which joined the multinational
force formed after Iraq invaded Kuwait, said the violence could
lead to ``grave consequences.''
   Also condemning the Temple Mount violence were the Japanese
Foreign Ministry, the European Community's executive body and the
president of the European parliament.
   President Bush said today Israel should have acted ``with more
restraint'' at the Temple Mount. But he said Iraq's Saddam Hussein
should not use the violence to try to link his occupation of Kuwait
with the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
   ``The Arab world is united, almost united, against him,'' Bush
said. ``If he tries to use this unfortunate incident to link the
two issues, I do not think it will be successful.''
   Moslem leaders said today's closure of the Temple Mount marked
the first time police had blocked entry to the 35-acre site and its
two mosques since Israel captured the surrounding Old City in 1967.
The keys to the gates of the wall around the Temple Mount were
returned to Moslem officials this afternoon and one of the mosque's
doors was opened, Moslem clerics said.
   Before control of the Temple Mount was returned to the Moslems,
the chief Moslem cleric, the mufti of Jerusalem, led 200 Moslems to
a gate of the shrine. Border police blocked their way and ordered
them to leave.
   When the Moslems refused, police fired tear gas, and the mufti,
Saad al-Din al-Alami was overcome, an Arab reporter said. The
mufti, who has a heart condition, was taken to Mukassed Hospital,
where he was reported in satisfactory condition.
   Earlier, police arrested the mufti's deputy on charges of
inciting Monday's rioting.
   On the southern outskirts of Jerusalem today, three Arabs
stopped at a border police roadblock jumped out of their car. One
of them plunged a screwdriver into the side of one officer and
stabbed a second officer in the arm.
   The three then tried to speed away but police opened fire,
shooting two of the Palestinians, police said. Both the officers
and the Arabs suffered slight wounds, police spokesman Uzi Sanduri
said.
   In Nazareth today, police fired tear gas to disperse dozens of
activists who blocked roads with overturned garbage cans and
stones, an Arab reporter said. Masked youths shouting pro-Iraqi
slogans broke into a department store, smashing windows and beating
shoppers.
   The army extended curfews on the Gaza Strip and most of the
occupied West Bank, restricting the more than 1 million Palestinian
residents to their homes. The U.S. State Department advised
Americans to avoid travel to the occupied territories.
   The curfews were imposed after three Palestinians were killed
and at least 65 were wounded Monday by army gunfire during protests
that followed the Temple Mount violence.
   Also today, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested
Israel would block a proposed U.N. fact-finding mission to Israel.
He urged Washington to veto an inquiry into the violence at the
Temple Mount.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said Monday's riots were
engineered by pro-Iraqi Palestinian extremists to deflect attention
from Iraqi aggression.
   The violence began Monday after 3,000 Arabs hurled stones from
the Temple Mount onto 14,000 to 20,000 Jews praying at the Wailing
Wall below. The wall, the last remnant of the Jewish Temple, is
Judaism's holiest site.
   About 25 people were injured by the stones, and police stormed
the mosque compound, firing tear gas, rubber bullets and live
ammunition.
   Authorities said 22 civilians and five or six officers were hurt
by stones, and 120 Arabs were arrested.
   The Arabs apparently were angered by rumors a Jewish group
planned to march onto the Temple Mount, which is revered by Moslems
and Jews. Palestinians also said tensions were raised by a speech
in which Shamir said he hoped a new Jewish neighborhood would be
built in east Jerusalem.
   The deaths raised the uprising toll to 758 Palestinians killed
by troops or Israeli civilians. At least 278 Arabs have been slain
by Palestinians, most as suspected collaborators. Forty-eight
Israelis have been killed.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling Favoring Landlord in Discrimination Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court has let stand
its ruling that a landlord may refuse to rent to an unmarried
couple because of his religious beliefs.
   The court Monday denied a petition to rehear the discrimination
case, in which it ruled 4-3 last month in favor of landlord Layle
French of Marshall.
   The court had ruled that French's rights of conscience take
precedence over the couple's rights under the state's laws against
discrimination.
   State Human Rights Commissioner Stephen Cooper sought the
rehearing, saying the decision contradicted the state Legislature's
intent to prevent discrimination on the basis of marital status.
   Cooper said the ruling opened the door to landlords imposing
their morality on tenants.
   In June 1989, an administrative law judge found that French had
violated the law when he voided an agreement to rent a house to Sue
Parsons after learning Parsons would live in the house with her
fiance. French cited his religious beliefs against sex outside
marriage.
   A state Appeals Court panel upheld the judge last fall, although
it did not dispute the sincerity of French's religious beliefs.
   The state Supreme Court reversed that decision.

   A smiling Nelson Mandela returned
to prison Tuesday, this time on a visit with promising news for
African National Congress comrades still jailed for anti-apartheid
activities.
   ``It evokes all kinds of memories ... but I'm concentrating on
the pleasant ones,'' said Mandela, who was released in February
after 27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the white-led
government.
   He went to Pollsmoor and Robben Island to tell jailed ANC
members about government plans to release political prisoners.
   Mandela spent nearly two decades on Robben Island, some of it
breaking rocks in hard labor, before his transfer in 1982 to
Pollsmoor.
   He described Tuesday's meetings as emotional.
   ``The atmosphere was one of enthusiasm and the spirit of
comradeship was so strong that when we meet, the emotions run
wild,'' he said after his visits.
   Mandela said he spoke only to ANC members, but that the
organization seeks the release of all political prisoners,
irrespective of affiliation.
   ``We have set a date by which all political prisoners will be
released and that is the end of April 1991,'' he said. ``All that
we are concentrating on is that political prisoners are released as
soon as possible and we are busy with that process.''
   The ANC has said the government must free all political
prisoners before the black opposition movement will enter
full-scale negotiations on ending apartheid and white-minority
rule.
   The government has released dozens of prisoners in recent months
and 15 more are scheduled to be freed Wednesday from Robben Island.
Another six also are to be released from other South African
prisons, the ANC said. It says there are some 3,000 people it
considers political prisoners.
   President F.W. de Klerk has said his government will free all
political prisoners, but has not said how many inmates fall in that
category.
   On Monday, de Klerk said the ANC's estimated 20,000 exiles could
begin applying for amnesty to clear the way for their return to
South Africa.
   De Klerk, who legalized the ANC in February, cautioned that
amnesty would not automatically be granted to everyone who applied.
   The release of political prisoners and the return of exiles are
two main obstacles to negotiations on ending apartheid.
   De Klerk says he wants to draw up a new constitution with
opposition groups that would allow the 5 million whites and 30
million blacks to share power. The government and the ANC have been
holding preliminary talks since May.
   Mandela appeared in a jovial mood before visiting Robben Island.
He smiled broadly while boarding a boat to the prison, the most
noroious in South Africa.
   He recognized a guard on the craft and greeted him warmly,
saying, ``Oh, you are a sergeant now.''
   Later, Mandela recalled some aspects of prison life.
   ``As you know, we were not allowed to read newspapers,'' he
said, ``and I remembered very well how successful we were in
smuggling in newspapers.''

   Tropical Storm Klaus fell apart off the Florida
coast today after punishing the Bahamas with rains and gale-force
winds, forecasters said.
   Top winds dropped to 35 mph as the system disintegrated, and all
storm warnings in the Bahamas were dropped.
   Tropical Storm Lili also appeared ready to peter out in the
mid-Atlantic, forecasters said. No more advisories were planned for
bot storm systems.
   Klaus had prompted the Navy to cancel shore leave for sailors
visiting Fort Lauderdale and order the fleet out to sea, but that
order was dropped when the storm weakened into a tropical
depression late this morning.
   The biggest continuing danger from the storm's remnants was
heavy rain across south Florida, coastal erosion and flooding, said
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables.
   Flood warnings went up from the northern Florida Keys to Jupiter
Inlet in Palm Beach County.
   Water managers welcomed the rain, however, saying it can help
alleviate the effects of a two-year drought.
   By noon EDT, the depression left by Klaus was centered near 24.0
north latitude and 76.0 west longitude, or about 115 miles
southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas. It was heading west-northwest
at about 15 mph and was expected to continue on that course.
   Klaus, the 11th named storm of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane
season, briefly reached hurricane status Friday, leaving at least
six dead and 1,500 homeless in the northeastern Caribbean before
being downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm when its top winds
dropped below 74 mph.
   On Sunday, it was downgraded to a tropical depression when its
winds dipped below 39 mph, but picked up enough strength to become
a tropical storm again until today.
   Lili, meanwhile, remained in the open Atlantic, and was turning
into just another storm.
   At noon EDT, Lili' was centered near 30.3 north latitude and
49.0 west longitude, or about 930 miles east of Bermuda.
   Lili had top sustained winds of 65 mph and was expected to
weaken by Wednesday as it headed south southwest at 8 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Frustrated Workers Angered by Budget Process That Leaves Them
Dangling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal workers, spared at least temporarily
from layoffs by a last-minute budget deal, trooped back to work on
Tuesday, frustrated by the chaotic process that left them dangling
for weeks.
   ``Other countries of the world have got to be laughing their
heads off. We try to run the world, but we can't manage our own
affairs,'' said Tom Doherty, an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration inspector from Allentown, Pa.
   ``It's been up and down every day ... Every federal employee is
feeling that bit of salt in the wound,'' said Dale Bodinus, a
``non-essential'' tax collector from Detroit who faced being laid
off from the Internal Revenue Service.
   The government, closed over the holiday weekend due to a budget
stalemate between Congress and the White House, had faced the
prospect of a paralyzing shutdown of non-essential services on
Tuesday without an agreement.
   A deal was struck late Monday, and widespread layoffs of
hundreds of thousands of the nation's 2.4 million federal workers
were averted.
   Many federal employees contend Congress and the Bush
administration have used them in a political tug-of-war.
   ``We feel like pawns, like we're very expendable ... except when
it comes to who can use us for more power, to get their bills
passed or to raise taxes,'' said Gretchen Kenney, a Social Security
claims processor in Chicago.
   The yearly budget fiasco threatens to make government work -
which already suffers a bad reputation - even less appealing,
federal workers said.
   John Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, said federal workers make, on
average, about 22 percent less than their counterparts in the
private sector. In addition, the government pays about 1,100 less
in health care premiums for each worker than the average medium or
large corporation pays.
   ``If you were in the top 5 percent of your class, and were
excited about doing some significant research for a cure for AIDs,
would you want to come to work for the federal government? I think
not,'' Sturdivant said.
   Federal workers have always known ``they're not going to get
rich,'' said Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury
Employees Union.
   ``But there was an implicit agreement that they had job
security. That agreement has been ripped apart the past few
weeks,'' Tobias said.
   The uncertainty of federal workers' job status is not over. If a
final budget isn't reached by Oct. 19, a government shutdown could
still occur.
   The threat of forced furloughs had been hanging over workers for
weeks. They were notified more than a month ago that they might
face up to 22 days of furloughs under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-cutting law if Congress and the Bush administration did not
strike a budget deal.
   The possibility of a wholesale government shutdown - which would
have sent thousands of non-essential workers home indefinitely -
hit last Friday when Congress balked at passing the original
deficit-reduction plan Bush pitched on television.
   ``You have no idea the turmoil this has caused for some people,
the ones trying to support a family on one pay check,'' said
Doherty, the OSHA inspector from Pennsylvania.
   ``They don't know what to do. I do. I keep telling them, your
voice is at the ballot box. Come election time, good, bad or
indifferent, we just go in and vote for the guy's opponent,''
Doherty said.
   Bodinus, the tax collector from Detroit, said, ``I've got 27
years with the federal government, and I take a little bit of pride
in my job. Unfortunately, I don't think Congress is taking the same
kind of pride in their job.
   ``They've become experts in taking things down to the wire.
They've done more work in the past week than they have all year. I
pay my taxes faithfully, and I don't think I'm getting my money's
worth.''

   Gov. Kay Orr said today her life has been
threatened and she will not campaign in a county divided by plans
to build a low-level radioactive waste facility.
   The threat came within the past six months and she knows who
made it, Orr said at a news conference this morning. But the
governor refused to disclose the name.
   The Nebraska State Patrol was investigating it, she said.
   The sparsely-populated Boyd County has been in turmoil since a
company developing a low-level radioactive waste warehouse for five
states said it wanted to build the facility there.
   Mrs. Orr said she had hoped the situation in Boyd County
wouldn't deteriorate to the point where threats were made.
   ``There are a lot of things that you consider when you step into
a public office,'' Mrs. Orr said. ``I think most of it was pretty
well understood by Bill (her husband) and me.
   ``It's dismaying to think that we have gotten to this point that
people lose faith and confidence in their government,'' she said.
   State Patrol spokesman Jeff Hanson said a letter was received in
early August that contained some implied threats but lacked some
elements needed before authorities could carge a person with
making terroristic threats.
   Hanson declined to release any specifics about when the letter
was received, where it came from or what it said.
   ``We are concerned and we are continuing the investigation,''
Hanson said.
   Doug Parrott, a spokesman for the Orr campaign, said the state
continues to review US Ecology's application for a permit to
develop the site near Butte near the South Dakota border.
   The reinforced concrete warehouse would hold waste from five
states in the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Compact Commission: Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and
Kansas.
   The news of the threat came at a conference in which she was
releasing information on her campaign finances. Mrs. Orr released a
report that showed she has spent $1.5 million in her gubernatorial
race against Democrat Ben Nelson.
   Orr, the nation's first Republican woman elected governor, said
Nelson has spent at least $500,000 of his own money and 73 percent
of his support has come from outside Nebraska.
   Nelson's campaign manager, Sonny Foster, said this was the first
he had heard of the threat to Mrs. Orr and said that it had
``absolutely nothing'' to do with the Nelson campaign.
   Nelson has visited Boyd County and has said that he is concerned
about the divisions in the community, Foster said.
   ``You have neighbors pitted against neighbors,'' he said.
   Nelson is scheduled to make one more trip to Boyd County to
attend a fund-raiser in Naper on Sunday, Foster said.

   Two brush fires burned out of control today,
threatening more Southern California homes a day after fires fanned
by Santa Anas damaged 28 houses and charred hundreds of acres.
   A 600-acre blaze threatened homes in dense brush near South
Mountain, south of Santa Paula, said Ventura County fire dispatcher
CeCe Grives.
   Three air tankers and more than 220 firefighters attacked the
blaze, which began 11 p.m. Monday and raged uncontained 50 miles
north of Los Angeles.
   Firefighters formed a defense line overnight to protect 20 homes
from the flames near South Mountain, Grives said. No residents were
evacuated.
   Another fire broke out 8 a.m. today and raced up a hill 10 miles
north in the Mupu area of Santa Paula Canyon, blackening at least
10 acres but not threatening any homes, said Fire Department
spokeswoman Bobbie Barker.
   Northeast winds began blowing up to 15 mph early today.
   ``That's going to hamper the firefighters,'' Barker said.
   In Riverside and Los Angeles counties, nearly 300 acres of brush
were burned and 28 homes damaged Monday by stubborn fires pushed by
Santa Anas.
   A 125-acre wildfire that began in the dry Santa Ana River bottom
in Riverside damaged 20 homes. In the Los Angeles suburb of Diamond
Bar, a 20-acre fire badly damaged three homes and slightly damaged
four.
   The Diamond Bar fire caused an estimated $1 million damage, said
Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Lawrence Beals.
   A total damage estimate in the Riverside fire was not
immediately available, said Fire Chief Phil Clinton.
   The fires' causes were under investigation.
   Clinton said arson investigators were checking reports that
teenagers were playing in the Santa Ana River area shortly before
the fire.
   Authorities called a red flag fire warning because of winds
gusting to 50 mph and low humidity associated with the fall's first
Santa Ana conditions.
   The strong gusts occur as high pressure over the desert interior
forces air over the region's mountains and down toward the Pacific
Ocean.
   The Riverside blaze began at 10:30 a.m. Monday in dense brush
and bamboo, sweeping up the Santa Ana River's embankments and into
backyards. Authorities evacuated 900 youngsters from Mountain View
Elementary School and ordered residents to leave more than 40
houses.
   At least 20 homes were damaged before 200 firefighters contained
the fire at 9 p.m., said city fire Battalion Chief Bud Palmer.
Three firefighters and three residents suffered minor injuries.
   Residents hosed down their roofs and yards as helicopters dumped
water on the blaze from above. Wind-borne embers torched palm trees
up to a quarter-mile from the river.
   ``Those fires are almost impossible to put out under the best of
conditions,'' Fire Chief Douglas Greene said of the tree fires.
   Residents helped their neighbors ward off the flames.
   The American Red Cross closed a shelter for evacuees after
serving just one person. Riverside is about 60 miles east of Los
Angeles.
   In Diamond Bar, a brush fire spread quickly to a residential
area and severely damaged three homes Monday, said Los Angeles
County fire Capt. Cliff Norton. The roofs of four other homes
suffered minor damage.
   Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters controlled the
blaze by 5 p.m., sheriff's Sgt. Sylvia Fort said. Some residents
were evacuated to Diamond Bar High School shortly after the fire
was reported at 3:15 p.m., Fort said.
   A small brush fire in Fontana destroyed one structure, leaving
just a stone chimney, witnesses said. It was controlled before
incurring any more damage. Fontana is 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   About 10 miles north of Fontana, a fire at the base of the Cajon
Pass near Glen Helen Regional Park scorched 148 acres, said Greg
Cooper, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry.
   The blaze briefly threatened the Treehouse Fun Ranch nudist
camp, but no evacuation was ordered, Cooper said. The fire was
controlled at 6 p.m.

   The Supreme Court said Tuesday it would decide
whether police may conduct random drug searches aboard buses and
trains without a warrant.
   The court, which has never ruled on random searches aboard
public transportation, said it would review a Florida court ruling
that such searches violate passengers' rights. A decision is
expected by July.
   The Florida Supreme Court ruled 4-3 last year that travelers, in
effect, are coerced into consenting to have their luggage searched
when police come aboard and randomly choose passengers.
   The passenger has been placed in temporary police detention
since there is ``no place to which a reasonable traveler might
leave and no place to which he or she might walk away,'' the state
court said.
   The Florida court ruled in a case in which Broward County
sheriff's officers boarded a bus bound from Miami to Atlanta during
a stopover in Fort Lauderdale.
   The officers said they were looking for illegal drugs and asked
a passenger, Terrance Bostick, to let them search his luggage. They
said he consented before a search found cocaine in one of his bags.
   Bostick said he was asleep, lying across the back bench of the
bus when the police boarded. He also said the officers blocked the
aisle, making it difficult for him to leave.
   Florida courts noted that one officer carried a zipper pouch
containing a pistol.
   The officers had no court-issued search warrant and no grounds
to suspect Bostick had illegal drugs.
   The state Supreme Court said Bostick was detained unlawfully by
the officers. Even if the passenger felt free to leave, the state
court said, he was not about to get off the bus moments before its
trip to Atlanta was to resume.
   ``Bostick in fact was `seized' by the officers and any consent
he gave to search his luggage was not free from the taint of the
illegal detention,'' the state court said.
   Florida prosecutors told the justices the state court's ruling
``severely restricts the ability of police to interdict illegal
drug shipments i public transportation facilities.''
   State officials said the problem is particularly acute in
Florida because it is a pipeline for drug smugglers. They said
police in Broward and Palm Beach counties regularly board buses and
trains during scheduled stops to conduct such searches.
   The justices in 1968 gave police the authority to stop people on
the street and question them if they had reason to suspect them of
a crime, or frisk them if they had a reasonable suspicion they were
carrying a weapon.
   The court also has given authorities considerable latitude to
question people in airport terminals who fit so-called drug-courier
profiles.
   Recently, the court bolstered police search powers even when
they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct.
   For example, the justices said in June that police may try to
curb drunken driving by setting up roadblocks and requiring
motorists to submit to sobriety tests.

   Statements made by the grandmother of a
teen-ager prominently mentioned as a suspect in the slayings of
five college students will not be allowed as evidence in his trial
on charges of beating her.
   Edward Humphrey, 19, faces an aggravated battery charge in the
beating of his grandmother, Elna Hlavaty, 79. She has said she no
longer remembers what happened that night and does not believe her
grandson attacked her.
   Today's ruling by Brevard Circuit Judge Theron A. Yawn not to
allow Mrs. Hlavaty's statements was expected to lead to a mistrial
motion, since prosecutor Philip Williams summarized the
now-excluded testimony in his opening arguments.
   But testimony by a doctor who examined Mrs. Hlavaty began with
no mistrial request by the defense.
   In his earlier arguments before the judge, Williams said the
state was concerned about Mrs. Hlavaty's motivations in changing
her version of the incident and needed the statements of others who
initially arrived on the scene.
   Humphrey is accused of beating Mrs. Hlavaty shortly after he
arrived at her Indialantic home on Aug. 30 from Gainsville.
   He had gone to Gainesville five days before to attend classes at
the University of Florida. During the time he was there, five
students - four females and a male - were stabbed to death in their
off-campus apartments.
   No one has been charged in connection with those crimes, but
police say Humphrey is one of several possible suspects.
   Yawn reminded jurors Monday that Humphrey was only on trial in
his courtroom for the Brevard County assault charge.
   ``That has nothing to do with the trial we are undertaking,'' he
said of the Gainesville slayings.
   Ms. Hlavaty, who is listed as a prosecution witness, recanted
her initial allegations, saying instead that she accidentally fell
and was not attacked by her grandson.
   If convicted of aggravated battery on a person over the age of
65, Humphrey faces at least three years in prison without parole.
   He also faces charges in connection with a 1988 attempted rape
and burglary in Indian River County and an Aug. 25 assault on two
male students at the University of Florida.
   Most of the jurors questioned Monday were aware that Humphrey
was a suspect in the five slayings, but said they could render an
impartial verdict in his assault case.
   Humphrey appeared to be dazed at the start of the proceedings,
but later he smiled and laughed. At one point, he began reading
aloud from a small booklet and was quieted by a court official.
   His mother, grandmother and two brothers sat in the courtroom
throughout much of the jury selection.
   ``The state's attorney has harassed me and my family so terribly
they should be in a cell,'' his grandmother said during a break in
the selection process. ``He sure did not hit me and he knows he did
not hit me.''

<HEAD>Court Upholds Decision Giving Religious Groups Access To Public
Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court sent an unsettling message
Tuesday to public schools that refuse to rent space to outside
religious organizations while allowing such access for
non-religious groups.
   The justices, without comment, turned down the appeal of a
Centennial, Pa., high school that had been forced to rent weekend
use of its auditorium to the Campus Crusade for Christ.
   A federal appeals court ruled that denying such access would
violate the group's free-speech rights.
   Tuesday's court action set no national precedent but allowed the
appeals court ruling to become binding law in Pennsylvania,
Delaware and New Jersey. The appeals court ruling also could serve
as a model for other courts.
   Lawyers for the Centennial school district said the appeals
court ruling, if applied nationwide, would convert ``most American
public school facilities into open public forums, to which even the
most fractious religious and political speakers must be routinely
allowed access.''
   Acting in numerous cases the day David H. Souter became
history's 105th Supreme Court justice, the court also:
   -Agreed to decide in a Florida case whether police without a
court warrant may conduct random searches aboard buses and trains.
   -Left intact an affirmative action program plan for hiring and
promoting more minorities and women in San Francisco's fire
department. The plan had been challenged as discriminatory against
white men.
   -Revived a $4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire Florida inventor
who says an American Broadcasting Companies television program
falsely portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy Arthur
Jones' libel suit against ABC over a 1987 report by the ``20-20''
TV program on the fate of 63 baby elephants Jones rescued from
death in Africa.
   The high court last June upheld the federal Equal Access Act, in
which Congress required that virtually all public high schools must
allow student prayer groups to meet and worship if other student
clubs are permitted at school.
   The court said in its June decision that the law does not
violate the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   But the federal law applies only to student groups - not to
outside organizations seeking use of school facilities.
   In the Pennsylvania case, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
relied, instead, on the Constitution's First Amendment when it
ruled last summer that school officials violated the free-speech
rights of Student Venture, a subsidiary of the Campus Crusade for
Christ.
   The officials refused to rent space at William Tennent High
School for a program aimed at religious conversion.
   By a 2-1 vote, the appeals court ruled that the school district
had created an ``open public forum'' by renting space to, among
others, the local Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, an adult education
program offering night classes and two labor unions.
   The appeals court said religious groups could not be excluded,
because of the message they sought to communicate, from such an
open forum.
   The 3rd Circuit court relied in part on a 1981 decision in which
the Supreme Court said state-run universities cannot ban student
groups from using campus facilities for religious worship and
study.
   The 1981 ruling said such bans generally violate students'
free-speech rights because it prevents them from using an open
public forum.
   In the appeal rejected Tuesday, lawyers for the Centennial
school district argued that public high schools and elementary
schools, for free-speech purposes, differ from college campuses.
   The appeal said the 3rd Circuit court ruling ``turns the First
Amendment into a sweeping equal access act, putting school
districts to an `all or nothing' choice regarding access to
nonstudent-initiated groups.''

   The Marine Corps released the names today of

   Maj. Nancy LaLuntas, a Marines spokeswoman in Washington, said
the families of the eight have been notified that they are missing,
but she declined to specify whether the men are presumed dead. She
said she did not know if the search was continuing.
   The eight missing men were identified as: Capt. Gary S. Dillon,
Capt. William D. Cronin Jr., Capt. Kevin R. Dolvin, Capt. William
J. Hurley, Sgt. Kenneth T. Keller, Sgt. John R. Kilkus, Cpl.
Timothy W. Romei, and Lance Cpl. Thomas R. Adams.
   The Marine Corps had not yet released the men's ages, hometowns
or other information. All eight were part of a search-and-rescue
squadron based at the Marine Corps Air Station at Camp Pendleton,
Calif.
   The helicopter crews were conducting routine night training
operations about eight miles from their shipboard base when radar
and radio contact was lost at 5:13 a.m. local time, said Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams. He said ``some floating debris'' from the
downed helicopters was discovered on Monday, but he would not
comment on any preliminary results of the crash investigation.

   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) - Folk singer Judy Collins says she's
enjoying renewed interest in her career and having as much fun
recording, writing and singing as she did at the height of her
popularity in the 1960s and '70s.
   Miss Collins was scheduled to perform Tuesday at the University
of California, Irvine.
   Best known for her renditions of ``Both Sides Now'' and
``Amazing Grace,'' the performer's recordings on the Elektra label
are being reissued on CDs. She also has a new album, ``Fires of
Eden.''
   Even the association Miss Collins had with the peace movement
two decades ago is continuing with her current involvement in
social issues. She recently performed at a New York rally for
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``I went to sing for Mandela this year and Tracy Chapman was
there,'' she said in an interview published Monday in the Orange
County Register. ``It felt good to be linking arms with the
present.''

   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) - To honor the memory of his son Jed, author
Ken Kesey went where he'd expect to find him.
   The Kesey family gathered early Monday on Mount Pisgah for
installation of a bronze sculpture by Peter Helzer.
   The artwork commissioned by the family commemorates the lives of
Jed Kesey and Lorenzo West, teammates on the University of Oregon
wrestling team. They died six years ago when a team van plunged off
an icy Washington highway.
   The surface of the 40-inch-high sculpture is a relief map of
mountains, rivers and towns in the Eugene area. Supporting it are
three bronze columns depicting Oregon's geologic history with
images of fossils.
   The family selected the mountaintop after Kesey's daughter,
Sunshine, asked him where they might go to meet Jed if ``somehow we
were to die and go into some kind of limbo.''
   ``I had this flash,'' said Kesey, who wrote ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Sometimes a Great Notion.'' ``And then I knew
that if we were going to meet somewhere, Jed would know to meet me
up here on Mount Pisgah.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Cartoonist Matt Groening, creator of
television's offbeat cartoon family ``The Simpsons,'' says his
mission is to offer a joke for everyone.
   ``Our ambition is to do a show that is watched by the whole
family,'' Groening said in an interview for Wednesday's syndicated
TV show ``Personalities.''
   ``We know that not everybody is going to get every joke, but we
think that there's enough stuff in there for the little kids as
well as more sophisticated stuff for grownups and ourselves to keep
everybody amused.''
   The fall premiere of Fox Network's ``The Simpsons'' airs
Thursday night.
   Groening said he's always dreamed of having a prime-time cartoon
show.
   ``It's a strange fantasy to have,'' he said. ``I was actually
surprised that no one else did it. I mean, when I was a kid
watching `The Jetsons' and `The Flintstones' and `Johnny Quest' and
a few other forgotten ones, I thought that somebody else would
catch on.
   ``It seems to me that there was an audience there, and I
certainly felt part of it was for good animation on at night.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission moved Tuesday to
block a joint venture it said would create a virtual monopoly in
the making and sale of a telescope commonly used by serious amateur
astronomers.
   The commission said it has authorized its staff to ask a federal
judge in Los Angeles for a preliminary injunction blocking the
proposed venture by Meade Instruments Corp. and Celestron
International, the two largest producers of mid-size
Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes.
   These telescopes use mirrors and lenses and are suited for
observation of both nearby planets and deep-sky objects, as well as
for astrophotography, the commission said. They generally cost
$1,000 or more.
   The commission said believed the joint production would
virtually monopolize the production and sale of these telescopes.
It said it would ask the court to block the acquisition until its
legality has been determined by administrative proceedings.
   If the preliminary injunction is granted, the commission will
have 20 days to issue a complaint beginning the administrative
procedure.
   Meade is headquartered in Costa Mesa, Calif. and owned by
Harbour Group Investments, L.P. Celestron is located in Torrance,
Calif., and owned by Diethelm Holding (USA) Ltd., a subsidiary of
Diethelm &amp; Co. Ltd. of Switzerland.
   Harbour Group and Diethelm have announced plans to form
Celestron Meade International, which would be half-owned by each of
the two companies.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Armed Forces Radio
started live broadcasts in Saudi Arabia Tuesday with an almost
inevitable opening line: ``Goooood Maaawrning, Saudi Arabia!''
   Echoing comedian Robin Williams' intro in the movie ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' disc jockey Rich Yanku broke in at 9:05 a.m. to
bring the Heart of the Desert FM 107 direct from an airbase in the
desert.
   An average mobile home would dwarf the two trailers that make up
the broadcast unit. They were dubbed Camp Schmooz by the four disc
jockeys after the favorite question of the unit's director, Bronx
native Lt. Arnie Pon.
   ``What are you guys schmoozing around for?'' Pon asks
constantly, using the Yiddish slang for idle talk.
   Picking the first song took a lot of schmoozing. Much of it was
worthy of Adrian Kronauer, the character Williams portrayed in the
film about Armed Forces Radio during the Vietnam War.
   ``Midnight at the Oasis'' was rejected as too sugary.
   Ray Steven's ``Ahab the Arab'' was also passed over and Hank
Williams' ``Don't Give Us a Reason'' was dismissed for hinting at
criticism of rather senior officials.
   ``We're probably always going to avoid playing that,''
acknowledged Air Force Staff Sgt. Harry Lockley, 25, of New Castle,
Pa.
   ``Rock the Casbah'' by The Clash finally was first on the air.
It seemed to fit with both the Middle East landscape - the tune
abounds with references to sheiks, Bedouins and Cadillacs - and the
role of nearly 200,000 U.S. troops underwritten by Saudi Arabia to
confront Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein after he invaded neighboring
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   One verse goes:
   ``The king called out his jetfighters.
   ``He said you better earn you pay.
   ``Drop your bombs between the minarets,
   ``Down the Casbah way.''
   The radio station's format will be rock 'n' roll, with some
country, folk, rap and reggae music from their collection of 8,800
compact discs. There will also be a jazz hour on most nights. The
station starts the hour with the AP Network News.
   Classical music? None scheduled, and polka is also doubtful.
   ``There are a lot of young guys out here used to hearing
hard-core rock 'n' roll, hard driving music,'' said Air Force Staff
Sgt. John Haynes, 27, of Phoenix, Ariz., one of four disc jockeys.
``I try to target the young guys.''
   The Saudi government has put some limits on what the radio can
broadcast. But no one in the unit would specify what was forbidden.
   ``It's basically just common sense,'' about what might offend
Saudi sensibilities, said Lt. Col. David MacNamee, head of the
Armed Forces Radio and Television Services in Saudi Arabia. A TV
station is still under discussion.
   The Moslem and tribal codes that determine public behavior in
Saudi Arabia include bans on alcohol, and the mixing of men and
women outside their homes.
   Most U.S. soldiers out in the field have been prohibited from
entering villages, and there has been cultural friction in places
where the troops share facilities. Saudi troops are shocked by
American men walking naked to the showers.
   Part of the radio broadcasts include pep talks on the kingdom.
   ``Saudi Arabia's a land of mystery. Or is it?'' said Yanku
between songs during his first 30 minutes on the air. ``If you take
a little time to learn about i you'll make your stay more
enjoyable.''
   Public service messages will include warnings about scorpions in
the desert.
   There's some question about how many soldiers will hear the
24-hour broadcasts because the number of transmitters is limited
and few troops brought radios. Several thousand radios have been
distributed and another 30,000 donated in the United States are
expected to arrive soon.
   Requests started rolling in within minutes of the live show.
   The first soldier to call was a woman named Kim, dedicating
Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' to her fellow troops.

   ``The jury's still out,'' President Bush says,
but in reality he's been badly bloodied by the budget turmoil.
   The president's poll ratings have slipped, his leadership
abilities are being questioned, his own Republicans are in revolt,
and he has thrown away his no-new-tax trump card.
   All this, and still no budget agreement.
   After five months of wrangling, Congress has given Bush only a
vague budget agreement along with promises to fill in the blanks
later with tax increases and spending cuts. To get even this much,
Bush had to shut down the government in an embarrassing spectacle.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush acknowledged that Americans
might justifiably wonder about the ability of the president and
Congress to govern. ``I can understand the frustration,'' he said.
``I feel it myself at times.''
   Bush badly misread congressional Republicans and the American
public about whether they would support a painful prescription that
would boost taxes on gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes and raise
health-care costs under Medicare.
   The voters spurned the appeal for sacrifice. Instead, they
called lawmakers to demand that they vote against the president.
And that's exactly what Congress did.
   On the critical budget vote, Bush could not muster half of the
GOP members of the House. Even most of the Republican leadership
abandoned him.
   For Bush, it was a crushing disappointment on an issue that he
had described as the biggest test of his presidency in the domestic
field. Bush may be enjoying still-high popularity ratings, but
what's it worth if it doesn't get him the results he wants?
   What Americans seemed to want was the old Bush - the feel-good
leader who promised not to raise their taxes. Many GOP politicians,
facing the voters in November, also liked the old Bush better.
   The president made it easy for Republicans to defect. He
promised there wouldn' be any penalty for a no vote. He's even
going out campaigning for turncoats, beginning with Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., on Wednesday.
   Despite Bush's collegial attitude, there are bad feelings
between the White House and congressional Republicans over the
budget negotiations.
   Bush's strong-willed chief of staff, John Sununu, and his budget
director, Richard Darman, were accused by some lawmakers of acting
arrogantly and treating them with disrespect. In one instance,
Sununu dismissed Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss. as ``insignificant'' when
he said he would vote against Bush's budget.
   Bush says he has full confidence in his staff. ``And when the
passions get high,'' Bush said, ``I understand that there's bound
to be a little broken china up there.'' He said the complainers are
just ``squeaky wheels.''
   ``The news of course is man bites dog, Republican goes after
Republican.''
   In less than a month, Bush's popularity rating has dropped 10
percentage points to 65 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC
News Poll. A CBS News poll measured the erosion at 14 percentage
points and pegged his approval rating at 62 percent.
   ``I guess I learned that you can't do it exactly my way when we
get down on something like the deficit,'' Bush said.
   ``So, when you get into somebody's pocketbook, or you're
worrying about a tax or a spending cut that affects someone, I've
learned that it's just not going to be done the way I want it,
especially if you don't control the Senate or you don't control the
House.''
   On the other hand, a 65 percent approval rating after 20 months
in official is unprecedented.
   Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said Bush probably has not suffered long-term damage
even though Washington insiders will put it down in their books
that Congress can whip him.
   The significant thing, said Hess, is that Bush's name won't be
on a ballot until 1992. ``He has a lot of time to make it up.''
   Besides, Hess said, ``The defining feature at this moment is
that we've got 200,000 American troops sitting on the sand in Saudi
Arabia. This (the budget) has to recede in the background.''
   Bush seems to agree. Is he vulnerable? Has he slipped? Are the
Democrats smelling blood?
   ``Well, without referring to the polls that I don't like to
refer to, have them take a look,'' Bush said.

   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S.
Southern Command and the field commander in charge of the 1989
invasion of Panama, is retiring, the Pentagon announced Tuesday.
   Thurman, 59, who was diagnosed with leukemia last July,
currently is undergoing chemotherapy treatment at Johns Hopkins
Oncology Center in Baltimore.
   The Pentagon said Lt. Gen. George A. Joulwan, 50, currently
commanding general of the 5th Corps, U.S. Army Europe and the
Seventh Army, has been nominated by President Bush to replace
Thurman and to be promoted to the rank of general.
   Thurman has been commander of the U.S. Southern Command, based
at Quarry Heights, Panama, since September 1989. He played a
central role in drafting the invasion plan for the December 1989
invasion.
   The four-star general had been scheduled to take mandatory
retirement in August 1989 but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
insisted he take over the Southern Command to help with the
administration's struggle with Gen. Manuel Noriega's regime in
Panama.
   A native of High Point, N.C., and a graduate of North Carolina
State University at Raleigh, Thurman held numerous key Army posts,
including Vice Chief of Staff and commanding general of the U.S.
Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Va., before
taking the top spot at Southern Command.
   Cheney also announced Tuesday that Adm. Huntington Hardisty,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, is retiring after
38 years of active service. He is to be succeeded by Adm. Charles
Larson, currently commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

   The silver inkstand used by signers of the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution returned to public
display Tuesday after being locked up three days by a federal
budget impasse.
   Nearby, the Liberty Bell could be touched again by visitors to
Independence National Historical Park, where for three days the
cracked symbol of freedom could be viewed only from a distance
through windows.
   Visitors also returned to Valley Forge National Historical Park,
Gettysburg National Military Park, the Statue of Liberty, Grand
Canyon National Park, Mount Rainier National Park and other
historic and recreational sites across the nation.
   But the emergency spending plan that allowed the sites to reopen
is only effective until Oct. 19.
   ``We're back in business for 10 days and then we'll see what
happens,'' Valley Forge superintendent Warren Beach said. ``It's
not the best way to run a park.''
   ``I think we're all pleased to be still employed this morning,
but we've only got a 10-day reprieve,'' said Richard G. Ring,
superintendent of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area near
Stroudsburg. ``We're hoping that things sort themselves out on a
permanent basis for the coming fiscal year.''
   The government lost its authority to spend money at 12:01 a.m.
Saturday after Congress and the White House failed to agree on a
spending plan for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Non-essential services were halted during the three-day Columbus
Day weekend, hitting tourist sites the hardest but keeping open the
threat of broad government layoffs until early Tuesday.
   President Bush signed an emergency spending bill early Tuesday
to keep the government operating normally through Oct. 19. By then,
congressional leaders hope to work out a deficit-reducing budget
that will last through next September.
   The inkstand is among the highlights of Independence Hall, once
known as the State House of the Province of Pennsylvania, where the
Declaration and the Constitution were signed.
   Marilyn Ritter of Gainesville, Fla., said she was moved ``almost
to tears'' to see the 18th century brick building.
   ``We didn't think it would be open, but we were real happy it
was,'' said Larry Head, of Dayton, Ohio.
   Head's brother, David, of Florence, Ky., said he blamed Congress
for not passing budget legislation soon enough to avoid a shutdown.
Asked if anyone had won his vote during the budget wrangling, he
said: ``Yes, anyone new.''
   At Valley Forge, the Continental Army campsite during the winter
of 1777-78, Gen. George Washington's headquarters and the visitor
center were open again and the interpretive and custodial staff
were back, Beach said.
   ``The main residual problem is the tremendous amount of trash
that was generated the past few days,'' the superintendent said.
The park's roads and fields remained open to visitors during the
warm, sunny weekend.
   On New York Harbor, ferries resumed hauling tourists to the
Statue of Liberty and the Ellis Island immigration museum.
   ``It's shaping up as a typical weekday and we'll have had about
3,000 to 4,000 visitor by the end of the day,'' said Park Service
spokesman Manny Strumpf. The average on a weekend is 25,000 a day,
he said.
   The first on line for the Ellis Island ferry were two women from
Portland, Ore., who flew in Monday night for a one-day visit
specifically to visit the museum, Strumpf said. One said her mother
was processed through Ellis Island when she emigrated from Norway,
he said.
   National parks lost thousands of dollars in uncollected entry
fees during the weekend.
   Grand Canyon National Park can can take in $20,000 in fees on a
normal weekend day, said spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge. ``So, I
guess we could have lost $100,000 through the holiday weekend,''
she said.

<HEAD>State Department Official: Diplomatic Ties Possible With Albania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is moving toward renewing
diplomatic ties with communist-led Albania, possibly before the end
of the year, a State Department official said Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz said discussions have
been taking place since the government of Ramiz Alia announced in
June that it wished to join the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe and re-establish ties with Washington.
   Asked at a congressional hearing if a decision on Albania could
be made before the end of the year, Seitz said, ``I don't see why
not.'' He said the discussions were ``moving in a positive
direction.''
   The ruling Communist Party maintains tight control over Albania,
but Alia has said voters are to be given some freedom of choice.
The party leader also has hinted at wide-ranging economic changes.
   The country of 3 million people has emerged from years of
isolation and last month renewed diplomatic ties with the Soviet
Union after a break of three decades over ideological differences.
   In August, three members of Congress visited Albania.
   In May, Alia told the first official U.S. delegation to visit
the Balkan nation since 1946 that he wanted to renew ties with
Washington as soon as possible.

   Justice David H. Souter took his seat on the
Supreme Court Tuesday in a solemn, hushed ceremony that contrasted
sharply with the loud debate over issues he'll help decide on the
divided court.
   After taking an oath to ``do equal right to the poor and the
rich,'' the 105th justice in U.S. history spoke briefly with
reporters and then began work by sitting silently through oral
arguments in four cases.
   ``I got to work on time this morning. I'm starting off on the
right foot,'' he said outside the court building after being sworn
in by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. As cameras clicked and
whirred, he said, ``Hurry and load up. I've got to go to work.''
   Rehnquist told Souter, 51, ``I wish you a long and happy career
in our common cause.''
   Souter, whose views on most controversial topics remain largely
unknown despite three days of Senate questioning, joins the court
at a time when the future of legalized abortion, affirmative-action
hiring laws, church-state relations and other major issues hang in
the balance.
   Three appointments by President Reagan pushed court to the right
during the 1980s, and early votes by President Bush's first
appointee will be closely watched for signs of whether that trend
will continue.
   In the audience for Souter's swearing-in were neighbors and
lawyer friends from New Hampshire, where he had served as a state
Supreme Court justice, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which recommended his
confirmation.
   Also present was retired Justice William J. Brennan, whom Souter
succeeds.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, wearing the morning coat
that is traditional for such ceremonies, presented Souter to the
court. Souter wore a three-piece business suit.
   Rehnquist then asked the new justice if he was ready to take the
oath.
   ``Yes, I am,'' Souter replied softly.
   After administering the oath, the chief justice gave his new
colleague a congratulatory handshake. Then, as Souter made his way
to his seat at the far left of the bench, he paused for a handshake
with Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   It was Marshall who said, after Souter's nomination July 23,
that he didn't have ``the slightest idea'' why Bush had nominated
the ittle known jurist, and added, ``Never heard of him.'' At the
time, Souter declined comment on Marshall's remarks.
   Souter said outside the court that he had preparedfor his cases
on a ``catch as catch can'' basis while also lining up a place to
live in Washington.
   He said he had signed a lease, and court sources said he would
be renting an apartment in Washington.
   When he signed the lease, the sources quoted him as saying, he
didn't know what his new salary was but was able to get by wen he
put down the chief justice as a credit reference. Souter will make
$118,600 a year.
   He was confirmed by the Senate, 90-9, after confirmation
hearings that focused on how he would rule if the court had
occasion to review its decision striking down state laws against
abortion. He declined to say, and many abortion rights activists
opposed his confirmation.
   His first case as a justice, however, focused on the less
emotional issue of whether shareholders may sue a company over
allegedly misleading proxy statements. The three other cases argued
Tuesday dealt with pension disputes, payment of expert witness fees
and the authority of prosecutors to exclude blacks as jurors at
trials for white defendants.
   Six of the nine justice interrupted the lawyers to ask questions
from time to time, but Souter listened in silence, often resting
his head in his hands. Once, he exchanged a few words that could
not be heard with Justice Antonin Scalia, who sits next to him.

<HEAD>D.C. Council Moves to Curb Mayor Barry's Spending Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council passed
emergency legislation Tuesday to restrict Mayor Marion Barry's
spending authority in his last weeks in office.
   Approved by voice vote were proposals to restrict Barry's
ability to lease property or award construction projects for the
district, and require the council to review any city contracts
proposed by Barry that exceed $1 million.
   The temporary, 90-day statutes can take effect without the
mayor's signature and will expire six days after Barry leaves
office on Jan. 2.
   ``The fact of the matter is we just don't want the mayor to
spend any money,'' said council member John Ray. ``That's the
emergency.''
   ``What we are seeing looks like an attempt to get a lot of
things signed, sealed and delivered before Jan. 2,'' said council
member Betty Ann Kane, who sponsored the bill intended to restrict
the mayor's leasing authority.
   Barry was convicted in federal court Aug. 10 of a misdemeanor
charge of cocaine possession.
   Before his conviction, he said he would not seek a fourth,
four-year term as mayor. Barry is running as an independent for a
district-wide city council seat.
   In recent weeks, council members have become concerned that the
mayor might be using city funds to reward his friends with pay
raises and contracts before he leaves office.
   Other members said they supported the bills to help fight the
city's projected $100 million budget deficit.
   Documents obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press show that
more than two dozen of Barry's political supporters holding city
jobs have received pay raises since August.
   The records do not indicate that Barry himself requested the
raises, but did show that they were approved by two of his top
assistants. Most of those getting the raises will receive a minimum
of $55,000 annually.
   Others employed under lucrative annual contracts were given
full-time positions. That would make it difficult to remove them
from office once Barry leaves as mayor.
   Democratic mayoral nominee Sharon Pratt Dixon has promised that
if she is elected on Nov. 6, she will fire 2,000 mid-level city
managers to save an estimated $95 million.
   The bills approved Tuesday will require council approval of all
city leasing or construction contracts proposed by the mayor's
office. The city spends about $40 million annually on such
agreements, under authority assigned to the mayor's office.
   Kane's aides said the restrictions were prompted partly by
Barry's announcement in June that the city will build a $20 million
office building to house city officials during renovation of the
city hall.
   Kane and others argued that the city could save money by renting
exising office space. They also questioned awarding the contract to
a developer who had contributed to Barry's past mayoral campaigns.
   Council chairman David Clarke sponsored the bill that would
empower the council to review all contracts for goods and services
that exceed $1 million. Previously, the council could only review
proposed renewal of such contracts.
   ``We are in a peculiar position in this city right now that the
chief executive is not answerable to the people,'' Clarke said.
``The council ... should take up that burden.''

<HEAD>Shoppers Vote to Keep Junk Structure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents want to junk the 60 tons of concrete
and metal that decorate a suburban mall, but shoppers say it'll
stay.
   By only three votes, a Gallup Organization survey indicated
Cermak Plaza Shopping Center's clientele wanted to save ``Big
Bil-Bored'' - a $25,000 pork chop-shaped sculpture that mall owner
David Bermant promised to tear down if a majority of shoppers
wanted it gone.
   ``The piece stays. I am delighted and completely astonished,''
Bermant said in a telephone interview Monday from Santa Barbara,
Calif.
   Bermant hired Gallup to poll his shoppers after residents of the
western suburb of Berwyn voted 4-1 in a March referendum to tear
down the sculpture. Bermant then hired Gallup to poll his shoppers
and said if a majority wanted the sculpture gone, he would destroy
it.
   The poll of 312 shoppers in early September indicated 145 people
wanted ``Big Bil-Bored'' torn down, 148 wanted it to stay and 19
were undecided.
   Bermant has commissioned large, unusual sculptures for five of
the 20 malls he's owned nationwide. ``Spindle,'' a stack of cars
impaled on a huge spike, also stands in the Cermak Plaza parking
lot.
   ``Big Bil-Bored,'' embedded with small appliances that symbolize
America's throwaway society, was erected a decade ago by artist
Nancy Rubins.
   ``The residents want it gone,'' Berwyn Mayor Joseph J.
Lanzillotti said Monday. ``I think the voters casting their ballots
are a lot more reliable than his survey.''
   Bermant earlier launched a public-relations campaign to save
``Big Bil-Bored,'' taking out full-page newspaper advertisements
explaining the sculpture's message and mailing copies to 30,000
mall-area homes.
   ``I think that might have convinced people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Top achievers in pressing environmental
causes soon will have their own version of the Nobel Prizes, a
descendant of the Swedish inventor of dynamite said.
   Claes Nobel, a Swedish-born resident of Milwaukee and a
great-grand nephew of the founder of the Nobel Prizes, unveiled
plans Monday to create Earth Prizes for environmental
accomplishments.
   Nobel said the Earth Prizes will be in the ``same tradition and
in the same spirit'' as the Nobel Prizes established by Alfred
Nobel. The environmental awards will not be affiliated with the
Nobel Prizes, he said.
   ``Let us all be inspired by the fact that each of us may bring
about a small change, and that all of us together can make an
enormous difference,'' Nobel said.
   He said seven Earth Prizes will be awarded annually in each of
two levels, one for grass roots activists, the other for heads of
state, world leaders, corporations and organizations.
   The seven categories are conservation, food, energy, pollution
abatement, population, disarmament and Earth ethics. Nobel, whose
foundation, United Earth, will name the winners, said the prizes
will include cash awards of undetermined amounts.
   Seed money will come from organizers of New World's Eve, an
international television telethon planned for Dec. 31.
   Bill Marshall, organizer of New World's Eve in Los Angeles, said
plans for an annual telethon for the next 10 years involving his
group and United Earth will be completed this week.
   The initial grassroots awards will be presented during the
telethon and financed by John LaBatt's Ltd. of Canada, Marshall
said.
   Nobel was invited to Douglasville by resident Leslie Schulten,
founder and president of Project Peace Tree, an organization that
works to improve East-West relations.
   Alfred Nobel invented dynamite in 1866 and endowed prizes for
science, literature and peace. The prizes are announced every
October in Stockholm.
   The Swedish Academy of Sciences has established prizes for
sciences not endowed by Nobel, including one for ecology.
   A 1987 genealogy of the Nobel family lists Claes Nobel as an
executive at Eweson Digester Corp., Alternatives Combustion
Engineering Inc. and the Earth Aid Society.

<TEXT>
   Opposition supporters shaved their
heads and staged sit-ins Tuesday in support of their leader, Kim
Dae-jung, who was on a hunger strike to press for democratic
reforms.
   At least 23 members of the Party for Peace and Democracy shaved
their heads in a ritual show of support at a district political
office in Seoul. Hundreds of party members wearing headbands and
shouting slogans also staged sit-ins at the party headquarters in
Seoul and at a dozen local offices.
   Kim began fasting Monday with four demands - dissolution of the
Defense Security Command, early implementation of local autonomy,
economic reform and scrapping of plans to change the form of
government from presidential to Parliamentary-Cabinet.
   President Roh Tae-woo and ruling party leaders appealed for a
truce in the political fight, but the opposition party threatened
to mount a national movement to topple Roh if the president
rejected Kim's demands.
   In a meeting Tuesday, dissidents and opposition party leaders
vowed to join forces for their anti-Roh campaign, including a major
rally Saturday in Seoul.
   Kim spent the second day of his hunger strike at his office
reading books and chatting with visitors. A 24-hour nurse assistant
periodically checked his blood pressure and temperature.
   The latest political turmoil began last week after an Army
private released classified documents he said showed the government
illegally spied on more than 1,300 civilians.
   Roh fired his defense minister and the powerful chief of
military intelligence Monday to minimize the impact of the most
serious scandal since he took office in early 1988.
   Roh asked the opposition to settle issues through dialogue,
warning that its boycott since August of the National Assembly
would ``amplify political and social unrest.''
   Kim demanded that Roh end ``dirty political operations aimed at
harassing opposition parties.'' He said the spy allegations showed
Roh's administration is ``a disguised military government.''
   The hardened position of Kim, who has survived political
persecution for more than 20 years, was apparently propelled by
mounting public criticism of Roh and the ruling party.
   The scandal jolted domestic politics, which have been in limbo
since August, when opposition legislators resigned from Parliament
en masse charging the government with railroading bills and
curtailing democratic reforms.
   Roh has pledged broad reforms, including an end to military
intervention in politics.
   He captured two-thirds of the 299-member National Assembly in
January by merging his party with two minor opposition groups. But
his popularity has dwindled because of inflation, social
disturbances and disputes within the enlarged governing party.

<HEAD>Americans Sharply Reduce Growth Of Installment Credit In August</HEAD>

   Americans cut the growth of their installment
credit in half in August, the government said Tuesday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumers took out a seasonally
adjusted $2.1 billion more than they repaid, an increase of 3.4
percent at an annual rate over July and slightly more than the
average $1.78 billion a month during the first seven months of
1990.
   But the growth of consumer credit slowed dramatically from a net
increase of $4.73 billion, or 7.8 percent at an annual rate, during
July, the Fed said. Consumer credit averaged $4.42 billion a month
during 1988 and 1989, the Fed said.
   Consumer confidence plummeted after Iraqi tanks stormed Kuwait
on Aug. 2, according to various surveys. The Conference Board, a
New York-based business research group, said confidence in the U.S.
economy in August dropped to its lowest level since 1983 when the
nation was emerging for its last recession.
   ``The slower growth in August reflected a larger decline in auto
loans outstanding and a smaller expansion of revolving credit than
in July,'' the report said.
   Automobile loans continued their slide, down 7.3 percent or
$1.74 billion. The sluggish automobile sector declined 1.6 percent,
or $377 million, in July and 7.3 percent, or $1.76 billion, in
June.
   Revolving, or credit card, debt rose $1.78 billion, up 10.1
percent from the previous month. But that was less than half of the
21.7 percent, or $3.78 billion, gain in July.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 10.6
percent, or $1.84 billion, after a 7.4 percent, or $1.27 billion,
increase the previous month.
   Borrowing for mobile homes advanced 10.9 percent, or $208
million, after a 3.3 percent, or $63 million, gain in July.

   Much of the Arab world bitterly condemned
the killing of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem by Israeli forces, and
some extremists vowed Tuesday to exact vengeance against Israel and
the United States.
   The killings at Jerusalem's Temple Mount - sacred to both Islam
and Judaism - could drag Israel into the Persian Gulf dispute at a
time when it has been trying to avoid just that.
   Middle East experts in Jordan expressed concern that Monday's
deaths might trigger terrorist acts which could be interpreted as
Iraqi-sponsored and bring the U.S.-led muliinational force and Iraq
closer to war.
   Palestinian terrorist Abul Abbas threatened to retaliate unless
the United States cuts its strategic ties with Israel. And
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said the deaths brought Israel
closer to ``the abyss.''
   Iraq called for U.N. action, while the radical Moslem
Brotherhood in Jordan called for a Jihad, or Holy War, to liberate
Palestinian land.
   Saddam also announced that a new Iraqi missile with a range of
hundreds of miles could be launched against ``the targets of evil
when the day of reckoning comes.''
   President Bush said Tuesday in Washington that Israeli security
forces should have acted ``with more restraint'' when they opened
fire on the rioting Palestinians.
   ``Let me just express my strong feelings about this, my sorrow
at this tragedy. It is particularly saddening because of the
sanctity of the holy places. Violence shattered all this,'' Bush
said.
   Iraq, which has been trying to rouse the Arab masses against the
U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf, said the battle against
the foreign presence in Saudi Arabia and Israeli occupation of Arab
lands was the same struggle.
   Thousands of Palestinians and Jordanians took to the streets of
Jordan's capital, Amman, Tuesday under a sign reading ``Mohammed
and Christ came for peace, Bush and Israel came for Blood.''
   In Beirut, hundreds of Palestinians burned tires around their
refugee camps, while shops closed and protesters marched through
the shantytowns shouting ``Stop the massacres!''
   Israeli officials said the shooting started Monday after Arabs
began stoning Jewish worshipers at Judaism's holiest site, the
Western Wall, which is below the Temple Mount.
   It was the bloodiest incident in Jerusalem since the Middle East
war in 1967.
   ``Palestinian blood will not be cheap. We will wait and see what
the United States reaction will be. But our retaliation will be
severe against Israel and the United States,'' said Abbas, leader
of the Palestine Liberation Front and suspected mastermind of the
Achille Lauro cruise ship hijacking in 1985.
   Abbas, at a news conference in Baghdad, set several conditions
he said Washington must meet to avoid retaliation against U.S.
targets.
   Among them were resuming its suspended dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, suspending its alliance with
Israel and not vetoing U.N. Security Council resolutions expected
against Israel because of the killings.
   The 18-month U.S.-PLO dialogue was broken off by Bush last May
after PLO leader Yasser Arafat refused U.S. demands that Abbas be
punished for an abortive raid on Israel by the Palestine Liberation
Front.
   Saddam said Tuesday that ``We, the Arabs, will not be satisfied
and it will not heal the hearts which have grieved over their
dearest in Palestine with anything except action.''
   His speech was monitored in Nicosia.
   Baghdad's state-run al-Qadissiyah daily called on all Arabs to
``consider the battle against foreign intervention and that against
the Zionist occupation as one.''
   More than 200,000 troops were deployed in the Persian Gulf area
after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The multinational force, which
is led by the United States, includes Western and Arab troops.
   George Habash, leader of the Popular Front For the Liberation of
Palestine, said the international community that condemned the
Iraqi invasion must also force implementation of U.N. Resolution
242, calling for an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip
and West Bank.
   Also condemning the Temple Mount killings were Egypt, Jordan and
the PLO's executive committee.
   Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, accused Israel of trying to ``erase the
Palestinian identity.''
   Jordanian newspapers said the Temple Mount killings demonstrated
the link between the gulf crisis and Israel's hold on the occupied
territories. Several newspapers urged an international blockade of
Israel.
   Jordanian police dispersed thousands of protesters who tried to
march on the U.S. Embassy in Amman. The demonstrators denounced
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, President Hafez Assad of Syria
and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the three Arab leaders who have
backed the U.S.-led military intervention in the gulf.
   Several Arab governments, including Syria, have made no official
comment on the killings.

   U.S. officials are satisfied with German
efforts to prevent illegal shipments of war materials to Iraq, a
State Department official told Congress on Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz said Germany has
``overhauled and tightened up'' its laws covering exports that
might be used for the production of chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons.
   Seitz told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that there are
``German footprints'' all over equipment that has gone to Iraq in
recent years.
   Seitz said companies in other countries also have assisted Iraq
in its production of chemical weapons and other armaments. He
declined to identify those ocuntries.
   ``This is not exclusively a German problem,'' he said.
   More than 20 people working for nine German companies are
suspected of helping Iraq obtain chemical weapons and other arms in
the years before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, a German
government prosecutor said Tuesday. Four are in custody for
investigation and three have been released on bail or for health
reasons, the official said.
   The magazine Der Spiegel has named nearly 40 German companies it
says supplied Iraq with equipment needed to produce chemical,
biological, nuclear and conventional weapons in recent years.
   ``There is no question in my mind that the intent of the German
government to get hold of this problem is very serious,'' Seitz
said.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who conducted the hearing, said the
Germans appear to have ``an extraordinarily distressing record.''

   Two brush fires burned out of control Tuesday
in Southern California. One threatened more homes a day after fires
fanned by Santa Ana wind damaged 28 houses.
   In Oregon, the Forest Service called in 280 firefighters to
attack a forest fire threatening to roar out of a wilderness into
sensitive spotted owl habitat on the Siskiyou National Forest.
   A 700-acre blaze in dense brush threatened homes near South
Mountain, south of Santa Paula, said Ventura County fire dispatcher
CeCe Grives.
   Three air tankers and more than 220 firefighters attacked the
blaze, which began late Monday and raged uncontained 50 miles north
of Los Angeles.
   Firefighters formed a defense line overnight to protect 20 homes
from the flames near South Mountain, Grives said. No residents were
evacuated.
   Another fire broke out Tuesday morning and raced up a brushy
hill 10 miles north in the rural Mupu area of Santa Paula Canyon,
blackening about 100 acres but not threatening homes, said Fire
Department spokeswoman Bobbie Barker.
   A highway between Santa Paula and Ojai was closed in the Mupu
area, Barker said.
   Northeasterly wind began blowing up to 15 mph early in the day.
   ``That's going to hamper the firefighters,'' Barker said.
   In Riverside and Los Angeles counties, nearly 300 acres of brush
were burned and 28 homes damaged Monday by stubborn fires pushed by
Santa Ana wind.
   A 125-acre wildfire that began in the dry Santa Ana River bottom
in Riverside damaged 20 homes. In the Los Angeles suburb of Diamond
Bar, a 20-acre fire badly damaged three homes and slightly damaged
four.
   The causes of the fires were under investigation. Riverside Fire
Chief Phil Clinton said arson investigators were checking reports
that teen-agers were playing in the Santa Ana River area shortly
before the fire.
   In the southwestern corner of Oregon, the Chrome fire grew to
640 acres Tuesday as it was driven by dry easterly wind. It was
headed south out of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness toward areas set
aside from logging to preserve sensitive plants and old growth
forest habitat for spotted owls, said Forest Service spokeswoman
Patty Burel.
   No rain was expected in the next 10 days to douse the fire,
which was blamed on a runaway campfire, Burel said.
   Firefighters had to hike two hours through steep rugged country
to reach the southern front of the fire.
   The fire was about three miles from the Wheeler Creek Research
Natural Area, the Lemmingsworth Gulch Botanical Area, and spotted
owl management areas, Burel said. The spotted owl was named a
threatened species this summer because of the loss of so much of
its habitat to logging.

   Stone-throwing crowds were tear-gassed
by police Tuesday as they waited to see ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto when she appeared before a judge on corruption
charges. Witnesses said 30 people were injured in the melee.
   A week earlier, supporters stormed the courtroom and injured
dozens of people so security was tight Tuesday around Punjab High
Court, where Ms. Bhutto went to answer charges of misconduct and
abuse of power.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on Aug. 6 dismissed Ms. Bhutto's
20-month-old government, the fifth popularly elected administration
to be sacked in Pakistan's 43-year history.
   Ishaq Khan, whose disagreements with Ms. Bhutto were often
highly publicized, cited a litany of charges, including corruption,
nepotism, ineptitude and abuse of power.
   Ms. Bhutto says the charges are a smear campaign.
   ``All this is done to eliminate Benazir Bhutto, who cannot be
eliminated politically,'' she said Tuesday during a break in the
hearing.
   Ms. Bhutto is standing trial before the Lahore tribunal on
charges of illegally selling federal land to a London-based company
owned by her cousin and giving lucrative contracts for distribution
of liquified gas to friends and relatives she said suffered during
a decade of martial law.
   She faces two similar charges before a special tribunal in her
hometown of Karachi.
   The three-hour hearing was adjourned Tuesday by the judgh until
Oct. 16 to give Ms. Bhutto's lawyers more time to prepare their
defense.
   Ms. Bhutto, 37, sat quietly throughout the proceedings, at times
scribbling notes or toying with her orange prayer beads.
Occasionally she read the Koran, Moslem's holy book.
   About 2,000 supporters pressed against street barricades to see
Ms. Bhutto, and witnesses said police tried to force them to leave.
Some angry supporters started throwing stones and bricks, and
police tried to drive them away with tear gas, the witnesses said.
At least 30 were hurt, the witnesses said.
   Some police officers blamed 30 to 40 of Ms. Bhutto's supporters
for the trouble, but said they were chased away and that no one was
hurt.
   Witnesses said police beat some supporters with cane batons and
arrested others. Police refused to answer questions.
   Most Pakistanis, including some of Ms. Bhutto's opponents, have
criticized the so-called accountability process used by the
caretaker government as a blatant attempt to force the former prime
minister out of politics.
   Most observers say the tribunals have strengthened her campaign
and galvanized her party, which two months ago was showing signs of
major divisions between the leadership and the rank and file.

   In the city's Jewish Quarter, where a forced
gaiety seemed to prevail Tuesday, a bearded Israeli in a religious
skullcap asked his young daughter, ``Are you having a good time? Do
you want a Popsicle?''
   In the neighboring Moslem Quarter, black flags flew in sympathy
for the 19 Palestinians killed in a clash with police atop the
Temple Mount.
   The violence Monday was the worst in Jerusalem since Israel
captured the Arab part of the city 23 years ago, and it only
appeared to deepen the chasm between Jews and Arabs.
   Even longtime Mayor Teddy Kollek, who has struggled for decades
to unite the city, acknowledged that his goal of Jewish-Arab
coexistence is a long way off.
   ``I still believe it will be all right someday, but it will take
generations,'' he said.
   In the Jewish Quarter of the walled Old City, Jews continued
marking the eight-day holiday of Sukkot.
   The Arab quarters were virtually empty, shut by a general strike
marking the killings and the start of the 35th month in the
Palestinian uprising.
   Palestinians on the streets were bitter.
   ``This is worse than in '67, worse than any other time,'' said
one who gave his name as Adan. ``There will never be peace now with
Jews.''
   Monday's rioting began when Palestinians atop the Temple Mount
hurled rocks at Jews praying at the Western Wall just below. About
25 people were injured by the stones, and police stormed the mosque
compound, firing tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.
   The Temple Mount is sacred to both Jews and Moslems. Because of
that, both sides see themselves as under attack.
   Israelis are fuming at the violation of the Western Wall, the
last remnant of King Herod's Second Temple and Judaism's most
revered site. It is also known as the Wailing Wall.
   Palestinians feel they were protecting Islam following rumors
that Jewish zealots, who want to rebuild the ancient temple where
the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques now stand, would march on
the mount.
   The mount, known to Moslems as Haram es-Sharif, is Islam's
third-holiest site after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The seam that divides the city runs on top of the Western
Wall,'' the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth concluded.
   Michael Ben Ari, a museum curator, said coexistence has been a
one-way affair.
   ``An Arab can walk about freely in Jewish neighborhoods, but a
Jew cannot walk about any east Jerusalem neighborhood without
endangering his life,'' he said.
   Thousands of Israelis flocked to the Western Wall on Tuesday.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews, many in festive silk garb and fur hats for the
holiday, shopped in the Jewish quarter.
   Some Israelis had pistols dangling from their hips. Many seemed
oblivious to the increased patrols by riot squad police wearing
flak vests and carrying submachine guns.
   In the Arab quarters, isolated groups of tourists shuffled down
the quiet stone streets. James and Carol Collier of New York City
said they had originally planned to come in September, but had
postponed the trip because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We just decided you don't know which crisis you're going to
step into, so you just go with one,'' Collier said.
   Across the street, Palestinian Mazen Aslan carried a stereo to
the hostel where he works.
   ``Israeli soldiers, you know, are like children,'' he said.
``They want to be like Rambo. But we are human beings and we are
not broken yet.''
   Immanuel Mizrachi, an antiquities dealer in the Jewish Quarter,
said Monday's violence ``just added another layer ot the hatred
between Jews and Arabs, and it will take something very special to
make them come together.''

<HEAD>Hungarian Parliamentarians Walk Out of Romanian Senate Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic Hungarian parliamentarians
walked out of Romania's Senate on Tuesday following the passage of
legislation they considered discriminatory.
   The state news agency Rompres reported the disagreement resulted
from a clause in a new law about the formation of private companies
that said ``the executive or executive secretary and at least half
of the leadership of commercial societies will be Romanian.''
   The 12-man faction of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in
Romania charged this could be interpreted as not including Romanian
citizens who are not ethnic Romanians. But their proposal to
explicitly extend the law to include ``Romanians of other
nationalities'' was rejected.
   When the article was passed in its original form the 12 walked
out in protest. Rompres later carried a government statement saying
the article should say ``all Romanian citizens irrespective of
nationality'' could head companies. But it was not clear whether
the government was suggesting reworking the legislation and then
voting on it anew.
   Sen. Zoltan Hoszu of the Democratic Union said ``it is
outrageous ... to have a Romanian in charge of a company that is
mostly Hungarians.''
   The incident followed several days of tension between ethnic
Hungarians and Romanians. On Sunday, state television reported that
several Hungarians attempted to destroy a Romanian flag on a statue
and were arrested in Tirgu Mures, site of bloody ethnic rioting in
March that claimed six lives.
   In the capital, Hungarians and Romanians have been demonstrating
this week before a school that was once exclusively Hungarian, with
both sides charging discrimination.
   There are 2.5 million Hungarians in Romania, a nation of 23
million residents. Most of them are in Transylvania, the
northwestern part of Romania that was controlled by Hungary for
centuries.

   Former FBI Agent Richard Miller was convicted
of espionage Tuesday for a second time by a judge who rejected
Miller's claim that he romanced a Soviet agent in the interest of
the United States.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi said he concluded that
Miller once intended to use his relationship with the Soviet woman,
Svetlana Ogorodnikov, to enhance his position with the FBI by
becoming a double agent.
   But the judge said that after Mrs. Ogorodnikov enticed Miller
with money and sex, the agent yielded to her demands for classified
information.
   ``In the battle of wills, Mr. Miller finally succumbed,
begrudgingly perhaps,'' Takasugi said. ``He became entangled with
Svetlana and compromised his position in the FBI.''
   Takasugi, who presided over Miller's retrial without a jury,
said the most convincing evidence was a tape recording of Miller
and Mrs. Ogorodnikov in a private conversation that was recorded by
the FBI.
   He said the tape clearly demonstrated her domination over the
agent.
   ``The court does find Mr. Miller guilty of counts one through
six,'' the judge said of the six charges that alleged espionage,
conspiracy and communication of classified material for the benefit
of a foreign power.
   Miller leaned forward on the defense table, stared straight
ahead and looked surprised.
   Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 1.
   The trial was Miller's third. The jury in his first trial
deadlocked and the guilty verdict in his second trial was
overturned by an appeals court on grounds that lie detector
evidence was improperly admitted.
   As in both other trials, the defense argued that the obese,
inept Miller was not the classic picture of an FBI agent and that
his failings led him to try to save his career by infiltrating the
Soviet KGB.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schiff, argued that
Miller was merely a victim of his own weaknesses and that he was
ultimately led to espionage by his love affair with Mrs.
Ogorodnikov.
   ``He was fascinated with Svetlana Ogorodnikov,'' Schiff argued.
``She was exotic to him.... He went out and slept with her.''

   The U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry
Divison, whose combat history stretches from last century's
frontier Indian wars to Vietnam, has begun arriving in Saudi
Arabia.
   It is the latest addition to the mass U.S. military buildup that
began after Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Advance units of the division, based in Fort Hood, Texas, have
been in the country for three weeks, and the main body of 17,000
troops is now arriving on the airlift from the United States.
   The division's M1 tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, helicopters
and other heavy equipment will arrive by ship over the next week,
U.S. military sources said.
   The 1st Cav, as it is known, is the last major army unit known
to be marked for assignment to Operation Desert Shield and will
boost the U.S. commitment close to, if not beyond, the 200,000-man
mark, the sources said.
   The Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Carl E. Vuono, told reporters
during a visit to army units Monday that the 1st Cav was ``flowing
in,'' but he refused to discuss its deployment.
   The division is the fourth elite U.S. Army unit deployed in
Operation Desert Shield, and it brings with it part of a fifth.
   The 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne and 24th Mechanized Infantry
Division, sent earlier, all have storied pasts. So does the 2nd
Armored Division, whose ``tiger'' brigade of 3,000 troops will
round out the 1st Cav as a full-sized division.
   The 1st Cav has served outside the United States for nearly 30
years since the end of World War II, possibly an army record.
   It was first organized as a division in 1921 at Fort Bliss,
Texas, drawing together some units that had already earned a niche
in history and remain part of the 1st Cav today.
   Among these are battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, which
fought the American Indians in the 1850s, and the 7th Cavalry, a
noted Civil War regiment. It later gained notoriety under Gen.
George A. Custer at the Battle of the Lttle Big Horn in 1876 when
the Sioux and other Indian tribes wiped out much of his command.
   The 1st Cav patrolled the Mexican border in the 1920s and '30s.
   During World War II it retired its cavalry mounts to become
infantry, and joined the 1944 campaign to recapture the Philippines
from the Japanese. The division was the first unit to enter Manila,
a claim it would repeat in Tokyo, and again during the Korean War
when its troops were first to reach the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
   After years of postwar occupation duty in Japan, the 1st Cav
returned to the United States, to be called on again when
hostilities escalated in Vietnam in 1965.
   By then it had become the army's first airmobile division,
applying a then-untested concept of using helicopters instead of
armored vehicles on a massive scale.
   The 1st Cav participated in many events that symbolized both the
battlefield courage and the political controversy that marked the
American role in Indochina.
   It relieved the siege of marines at Khe Sanh, battled Communist
infiltrators along the Cambodian border and was the main force in
the 1970 incursion into Cambodia to destroy North Vietnamese
sanctuaries.
   In 1971, the 1st Cav became the last full American combat unit
to withdraw from Vietnam.

   Prosecutors suffered a setback as
testimony opened Tuesday in the trial of Edward Lewis Humphrey, who
is accused of beating his grandmother and is a suspect in the
slayings of five college students.
   The judge refused to allow the prosecution to introduce as
evidence police accounts of statements the grandmother, Elna
Hlavaty, allegedly made the night she was battered at her home.
Mrs. Hlavaty, 79, has said she can't remember what happened, and
doesn't believe her grandson attacked her.
   Humphrey, jailed on a $1 million bond, is charged with
aggravated battery in the Aug. 30 assault.
   The 19-year-old University of Florida freshman has been listed
as a suspect in the mutilation-slayings of five students in
Gainesville in late August. No one has been charged in the
killings.
   The alleged assault on his grandmother occurred the weekend
after four women students and one man student were stabbed to death
in their off-campus apartments. Three of the women were mutilated
and one was decapitated, authorities said.
   In the assault case, prosecutor Philip Williams, saying Mrs.
Hlavaty was trying to protect her grandson, sought to introduce her
statements to Brevard County Sheriff's Deputy Douglas C. Hammack.
The deputy had answered an emergency 911 call from her home.
   But Brevard Circuit Judge Theron A. Yawn rejected the testimony,
saying the hearsay account of her statements shouldn't be used
since Mrs. Hlavaty was available as a witness.
   Before the ruling, Hammack told the judge out of the jury's
hearing that when he found Mrs. Hlavaty, her hair was matted with
blood, she was holding a bowl of ice on her face and her right eye
was swollen shut.
   ```He hit me. I can't believe he did this to me,''' the officer
quoted her as saying. When asked who did it, she replied,
``Edward.''
   The prosecutor said Mrs. Hlavaty also told Hammack and an
ambulance driver the attack began when Humphrey entered the house
yelling, ``You're going to hell and you're going to die!''
   She stated that ``the defendant picked her up, choked her and
beat her about the face,'' Williams said.
   Humphrey was also present and covered with blood, the prosecutor
said, and allegedly told the officer, ``I hit her - I'm sorry.''
   Dr. Jeri Fitts, the first witness in the trial, said he examined
Mrs. Hlavaty in the hospital. He said she suffered a broken facial
bone under her eye and a possible broken jaw, along with numerous
contusions.
   He denied the injuries could have been caused by a fall, as she
later said, testifying it would have taken three or four blows to
cause that much damage. If convicted of aggravated battery on a
person over the age of 65, Humphrey would be sentenced to at least
three years in prison without parole. He also faces unrelated
charges of attempted rape in Indian River County and assault in
Alachua County.

<TEXT>
   For Soviet sports fans, the fall classic has
begun.
   In a nation where chess is a national pastime, the confrontation
between Soviet rivals Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov is far
bigger than anything on the American sports scene - more colossal
than Dave Stewart vs. Roger Clemens, or Cincinnati's ``Nasty Boys''
against Pittsburgh's ``Killer Bs.''
   In World Series-style hype in the Soviet press, nearly every
newspaper's sports section Tuesday was splashed with pre-game
photos and expectations of the matchup in New York.
   ``Duel of the Giants Begins,'' the newspaper Lenin's Banner said
in a bold headline.
   ``Who will be smiling at the end of the match?'' Moskovsky
Komsomolets, another paper, asked the chess-mad nation. It showed
the grinning visages of the bitter antagonists already likened by
Kasparov himself to an American sports feud on the order of
baseball's Yankees and Red Sox.
   ``Karpov? Kasparov? Who then?'' wondered the Vechernaya Moskva
newspaper, with the large question mark inverted and wearing a
crown.
   The outcome of Monday's first game - a draw - came too late for
Tuesday morning newspapers, but Soviet television carried full
details.
   A floating chessboard appeared on the nation's TV screens
following Tuesday's midday newscast, the pieces moving by
themselves. Footage of Kasparov and Karpov appeared above it, then
dissolved into the words ``The World Chess Championship.''
   International Grandmaster Yevgeny Vasyukov stood on a sparse set
in a sweater vest and tie and spoke in soft tones.
   ``The attention of world chess lovers is centered on New York,
where two outstanding Soviet chess players, world champion Garry
Kasparovand former champion Anatoly Karpov, are playing each other
in their fifth meeting,'' Vasyukov said, beginning his blow-by-blow
account of Game 1.
   ``It was a highly dramatic match and abounded in many
interesting moments,'' Vasyukov said.
   Then he walked in front of a large board and ``played'' the game
by moving the magnetic pieces as Kasparov and Karpov had done,
noting that Karpov failed to develop a slight advantage due to
several wasted chances.
   The government newspaper Izvestia was caught up in the glitz of
the festivities before the first of 24 scheduled games between
Kasparov, 27, and Karpov, 39.
   ``Smiling broadly like great actors, they both energetically
made their way up the stage of the famous hotel `Waldorf Astoria' -
black tail coats, black bow ties on snow-white shirts,'' wrote
correspondent Alexander Roshal.
   ``According to the strict request of the organizers, most famous
American and foreign guest celebrities present were dressed
likewise,'' he wrote.
   ``And ladies glittered in rich evening dresses ... in the light
of a thousand candles.''
   Small details of the tournament did not escape Izvestia's
notice, such as 13 being Kasparov's lucky number, and how since the
age of 13, he has had that many members in his entourage. Karpov
decided to counter by having the same number in his party, it
added.
   The military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda even carried the latest
on a scandal in which one of Kasparov's coaches supposedly was
offered a $100,000 bribe to disclose the champion's strategies.
When Kasparov coach Zurab Azmaiparashvili refused, his apartment in
Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia, was burned.
   But Tbilisi police Maj. P. Lachkepyani said an investigation of
the apartment showed only an empty liquor bottle, scraps of the
newspaper Literaturnaya Rossiya, and a slightly burned front door.
   ``The evidence does not give cause for legal procedures,''
Lachkepyani said, calling the arson job ``amateurish.''
   His conclusion?
   ``It was most probably a hooligan indifferent to chess but
obviously eager to get some press,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.

   President Bush will confer with leaders of
Pacific island nations on economic and security issues during a
meeting in Hawaii on Oct. 27, White House officials said Tuesday.
   Invitations to the Pacific leaders were cabled Monday, said
Jerry Norris, executive director of the Pacific Basin Development
Council. The meeting will take place during a Bush political swing
through Hawaii and California.
   White House officials said invitations were sent to the Cook
Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru,
Nieue, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu
and Western Samoa.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said he could not confirm
Norris' statement that the main topic of discussion is expected to
be the proposed destruction of chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll,
800 miles from Hawaii.

<HEAD>Blacks Stab Eight Whites in Rampage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks armed with knives went on a
rampage Tuesday and stabbed eight whites, raising the specter of
new racial violence, authorities said.
   About 20 young blacks stole knives from a store and began
stabbing people along a street near the beach, police said.
   ``They were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knives
at anyone who was near them,'' witness Robert Trulock told the
independent South African Press Association.
   Two suspects were shot and wounded by police, and seven were
arrested, police said.
   The attack may have been racially motivated, said police Lt.
Nina Barkhuizen. Police were investigating the possibility that
some participants wore badges of the Pan Africanist Congress, a
militant black opposition group, she said.
   Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in South
Africa, there have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking
whites.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok condemned the violence and
called for private citizens to refrain from seeking revenge.
   ``It might be somebody trying to provoke a reaction from the
white population,'' said Thabo Mbeki, a spokesman for the African
National Congress.
   The black youths took the knives from a store specializing in
weapons from the Far East, Barkhuizen said.
   They then ran down a street next to the beachfront and stabbed
whites, witnesses said.
   Bleeding victims staggered into the lobby of the Lonsdale Hotel
and collapsed in front of horrified guests.
   Eight people, ranging in age from 15 to 85, were hospitalized
with stab wounds, Barkhuizen said. A hospital official said three
of the white victims were in serious condition.
   Patrick Lekota, an ANC official in Durban, called the attack ``a
desperate attempt to discredit the liberation movement as a
whole.''
   About 5,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting since
1986 in Natal Province, which includes Durban. But the violence has
been almost exclusively in black areas, pitting Zulu supporters of
the conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas and other blacks
linked to the ANC.
   The warfare spread to black townships around Johannesburg in
August, and about 800 people were killed in the ensuing weeks.
   Fighting in the townships has eased recently, but strained
relations remain between the white-led government and ANC.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela has accused security forces of fanning
the violence, possibly at the behest of right-wing elements who
oppose government-ANC peace talks on ending the apartheid system of
racial segregation.
   The government has denied the charges and challenged accusers to
provide proof. Vlok said Tuesday that affidavits supplied to the
government purportedly backing the accusations had proved to be
fabrications.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid but differ on the
shape of a future South Africa. Inkatha supports a free market
economy and promotes tribalism, while the ANC promotes more leftist
and pan-tribal positions.

   Discovery's astronauts, flush with
success from a near perfect mission, packed up their gear Tuesday
for their return to Earth while the satellite they released
streaked deeper into space.
   The Ulysses satellite, which will study the sun, was 1.7 million
miles from Earth three days into its five-year journey and hurtling
through the solar system at more than 24,000 mph.
   Discovery was scheduled to land at 9:57 a.m. EDT Wednesday at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to conclude NASA's first shuttle
flight in almost half a year. Good weather was expected.
   ``This flight is probably as close to perfect as we can get,''
said flight director Ron Dittemore.
   The biggest problemoccurred Tuesday when a heater on one of
Discovery's three auxiliary power units failed. Mission Control in
Houston said a backup heater was activated and working fine. The
heaters could be operated manually, if necessary.
   Discovery's commander, Richard N. Richards, and pilot, Robert
Cabana, completed a series of tests Tuesday to make sure the
shuttle's systems were ready for the fiery descent into the Earth's
atmosphere.
   The astronauts later retracted Discovery's 50-foot-long robot
arm, which was extended Sunday as part of an experiment to measure
the deteriorating effects of space on an Intelsat satellite stuck
in a useless low orbit. Attached to the boom is material identical
to that used on the satellite's solar panels.
   Intelsat, an organization of countries that owns the
communications satellite, will study the amount of decay and decide
whether it is worth sending astronauts on a rescue mission in 1992.
Scientific data to date indicates the spacecraft would be
salvageable.
   The $157 million satellite is orbiting about 345 miles above
Earth, 22,000 miles lower than intended. An unmanned rocket failed
in March to boost the spacecraft to its proper altitude.
   Before stowing cabin gear, astronauts Bill Shepherd and Bruce
Melnick ran a third and final test of an experimental voice command
system. The system would allow astronauts to move shuttle TV
cameras by spoken commands, freeing their hands for other tasks.
   Shepherd had trouble getting the system to recognize his voice
on his previous attempts. He reported complete success Tuesday
after recording his voice again, and speaking louder and more
directly into a microphone.
   The crew also wrapped up an experiment involving ozone
measurements in low Earth orbit. The data will be used to calibrate
ozone-measuring instruments aboard weather satellites.
   The highlight of the four-day mission came shortly after liftoff
Saturday, when the astronauts started Ulysses on its 1.86
billion-mile journey. The satellite was accelerated out of Earth
orbit at 34,130 mph, the fastest speed ever for a manmade object.
   The $250 million European spacecraft is expected to reach
Jupiter in February 1992. Ulysses will use the planet's strong
gravity to sling it back through the solar system and into an
unprecedented orbit over the sun's poles.
   It is expected to pass over the sun's south pole in 1994 and the
north pole in 1995.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, already
preparing for its next shuttle flight, had to move the Columbia off
the launch pad and back to the assembly building Tuesday because of
bad weather expected from Tropical Storm Klaus. Columbia will
remain inside until Monday, while Atlantis will be rolled out to
one of the two pads on Thursday.
   Atlantis is due to fly next, carrying a secret military cargo
into orbit in early November. The mission originally was scheduled
for July, but was delayed by the shuttle's hydrogen leaks.
   Still to be performed are repairs to Atlantis' engine
compartment, damaged slightly by a metal beam that was left there
by workers. The 9-foot-long beam left about 25 dents and dings when
it rattled around while the shuttle was being hoisted upright.

   Israel sealed the Temple Mount for a day and
imposed curfews in the occupied territories Tuesday to contain Arab
fury over the killing of 19 Palestinians at the hallowed site.
   Monday's bloodbath threatened to rekindle the Palestinian
uprising and thrust Israel back into the spotlight at a time when
the Persian Gulf crisis had given it a respite from international
criticism of its policies.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rebuffed suggestions for a U.N.
Security Council investigation. ``We won't accept it,'' he told
reporters.
   While large parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were
under curfews and village closures, rioting erupted in three Arab
districts of Jerusalem and in Nazareth, a mainly Arab city inside
Israel.
   In Umm Tuba on Jerusalem's southern outskirts, two border
policemen were stabbed with a screwdriver by Arabs they stopped at
a checkpoint. As the car drove away the police fired, hitting two
occupants, police said. No one was seriously hurt, police spokesman
Uzi Sanduri said.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse dozens of activists who
blocked roads in Nazareth with rocks and garbage cans, an Arab
reporter said.
   Masked youths shouting pro-Iraqi slogans smashed a department
store's windows and beat shoppers.
   Police seized the keys to the gates of the Temple Mount, Islam's
third holiest site and known to Moslems as Haram es-Sharif, and
fired tear gas at Moslems who tried to break through their cordon,
an Arab reporter at the scene said.
   Jerusalem's chief Moslem cleric, 80-year-old Saad al-Din
al-Alami, was overcome by tear gas and carried away on a stretcher
and hospitalized.
   Moslem leaders said the keys were returned after dark to allow
evening prayers. They said it was the first time Israel has sealed
the Temple Mount, a compound containing the city's two main
mosques.
   It abuts the Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, and
is revered by Jews as the site of their biblical temple. Moslems
believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven from the site.
   Monday's incident was the worst in Jerusalem since Israel
captured the city's Arab sector from Jordan in 1967, and was
swiftly condemned by Arab leaders throughout the world.
   Japan, the European Community's executive body and the president
of the European parliament also condemned the violence. President
Bush said Israel should have acted ``with more restraint.''
   Amnesty International, the international human rights
organization based in London, proposed a public judicial inquiry.
   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano condemned
``indiscriminate killing'' in Jerusalem and said the world is
counting on new efforts to resolve the Palestinian question.
   The flareup came after a relative lull in the 34-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. It began when Moslems on
the Temple Mount tossed a barrage of stones onto Jews celebrating
the Sukkot festival at the Western Wall below.
   The attack was provoked by rumors that Jewish zealots planned to
march on the Mount and reclaim it for Judaism.
   Police assurances to the contrary were ignored.
   Riot squads charged into the Temple Mount compound and,
according to Israeli officials, opened fire when they found
themselves up against a mob of thousands.
   Police said about 140 Arabs were wounded, along with a
half-dozen policemen and 28 Jewish civilians hit by rocks.
Thirty-seven Arabs and five Jews remained hospitalized Tuesday,
according to hospital officials and police.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek accused the Arabs of ``a planned
and organized provocation,'' but he also chastized Jewish zealots
who lay claim to the Mount, saying they ``exacerbated the Arabs'
deepest fears and angers.''
   Arab activists called a weeklong protest strike in the occupied
territories and a two-day shutdown in Israel's Arab towns.
   Israeli public reaction consisted of:
   -Outrage at what was seen as a planned attack by Moslem zealots
on Jews praying peacefully at their holiest shrine.
   -Allegations that police failed to foresee the attack and take
precautions that would have avoided fatalities.
   -Fears that the incident would distract world attention from the
gulf crisis and play into the hands of Iraq's Saddam Hussein and
his Palestine Liberation Organization supporters.
   Shamir, visiting a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, said
Saddam was trying ``to turn this confrontation between Iraq and the
whole world into a confrontation between Iraq and Israel.''
   ``We have no interest in this and we will not help him to do
this.''
   But left-wing legislator Yair Tzaban argued that those making
that claim should also explain why they allowed ``such an
escalation on both sides.''
   Shamir said ``the rioters paid a heavy price in human life . . .
But this is exactly what their leaders and activists want. They
place no value on human life, whether Arab or Jew.''
   He said Israel would strengthen its hold in the occupied lands -
``We will remain here, establish and fortify our presence in all
parts of the country, no matter how angry it makes them. This is
our country, our land.''
   Police began an investigation into their conduct at the Temple
Mount. Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner rejected the allegations
already leveled against his officers as ``simply not true.''
   He said he would not let the force become ``a punching bag for
all sorts of things. . . . Where we are guilty, where we are
responsible, we'll take the blame.''
   Jerusalem city councilor Shmuel Meir said, ``Whoever throws
stones and rocks at policemen should know that he'll get what's
coming to him, and he won't get home in one piece.''

   The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago on
Tuesday sought better U.S. intelligence communication following an
attempted coup he contends could have been prevented by
U.S.-supplied information.
   ``If we had the information that was in possession of certain
American authorities then we would have been able to prevent this
taking place,'' Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson said in
reference to the July 27 uprising on his Caribbean island in which
he was taken hostage.
   However, he insisted that he was not saying the United States
purposely withheld information.
   ``It was not an accusation,'' he said.
   He said ``certain authorities'' in Florida had information about
one of the coup leaders procuring arms in Florida for the coup
attempt.
   Robinson previously made similar statements.
   He told reporters at the White House that in his meeting with
Bush they ``talked generally about collaboration and exchange of
information ... in the field of containing attempts to disrupt
regimes in the region.''
   ``Certainly in the future we'll be seeking to be sure that
there's closer collaboration so there is an easier and freer
exchange of information,'' he said.
   Administration officials deny they had any knowledge of arms
being procured in Florida for the purpose of an overthrow in
Trinidad and Tobago.
   ``If we had we would have tried to alert them and stop it,'' one
White House official said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
congratulated Robinson and his government ``for the bravery shown
in confronting the terrorists and in defending their democratic
institutions.''
   Bush also ``commended the prime minister for his market-oriented
economic policies, his commitment to the war on drugs and for his
strong statement of support for U.N. measures against Iraqi
aggression,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the recent extension of the Caribbean Basin Initiative
was ``a sign of our firm commitment to the economic well-being of
the Caribbean, and we are confident that the Enterprise for the
Americas initiative will support Caribbean integration.''
   In the coup, Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the
government-run TV station and took Robinson hostage with about 50
other officials. The coup was suppressed after six days, during
which 24 people were killed.
   The government has declared a state of emergency and cancelled
elections scheduled for Oct. 15. No new date has been set, Robinson
said.
   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in Miami arrested
Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach, Fla., on charges of supplying
weapons to the coup leaders. A spokesman has said the bureau did
not know of his connection to the oup until after it occurred.
   Robinson was in Washington on his way home from the United
Nations General Assembly session in New York.

   A radio talk show host pulled the plug on
two congressional candidates whose on-air discussion deteriorated
into a shouting match.
   ``I don't know how to tell you this,'' WELI-AM's Steve Kalb told
the candidates, who continued jawing into dead microphones Monday
night. ``Your microphones are off, so no one can hear you.''
   During the discussion, Democrat Rosa DeLauro and Republican
Thomas Scott clashed repeatedly over abortion, taxes and what each
described as the other's hypocrisy and mudslinging.
   The two candidates are vying for the House seat of Democratic
Rep. Bruce Morrison, who is running for governor of Connecticut.
   At one point, when the discussion turned to abortion, the
pro-choice DeLauro told Scott, ``I speak for women all over this
country.''
   ``No you don't,'' Scott said.
   ``Yes, I do,'' DeLauro said. ``Yes I do.''
   ``You wish,'' Scott said. ``You're an extremist and a radical.''
   Kalb told the candidates to pipe down so he could regain control
of the ``Telephone Talk'' show, and when they didn't, he shut off
their microphones.
   After Scott and DeLauro left, Kalb told his listeners order had
been restored.
   ``All right folks,'' he said, ``we've cooled down the room ...
turned up the air conditioner ... poured water on the
microphones.''

<HEAD>Rinfret Going On Television To Promote ``900'' Number</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Pierre Rinfret plans to run TV
ads urging viewers to call a ``900'' telephone number to raise
money for his struggling campaign for governor.
   The TV ads, Rinfret's first, will encourage people to call in to
hear a recorded message from the candidate. People will be billed
$5 for the call, of which about $3 will go to the Rinfret campaign,
according to Rinfret aide John Denny.
   Rinfret's campaign plans to promote the ``900'' number service
with radio and newspaper ads as well. Rinfret is challenging
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Last week, Rinfret reported that his campaign had less than
$94,000 in the bank and $189,000 in unpaid bills.
   Cuomo, meanwhile, reported his campaign had nearly $6.1 million.
Cuomo's campaign has been airing TV ads since early August.

Election Day, a survey of likely voters shows.
   The survey of 617 North Carolinians, conducted last week, asked
people who they would vote for if the election were held that day.
Some 43.5 percent favored Gantt, 42.7 percent said Helms, 9 percent

<HEAD>Air Force Official Cites Widespread Problems at B-2 Builder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Northrop Corp., maker of the B-2 stealth
bomber, is plagued by widespread problems in its operation that
federal investigators have not addressed in their inquiry, an Air
Force official said Tuesday.
   Dismayed by what it considers Northrop's poor performance in
production of several weapons, the services assistant secretary for
acquisition, John Welch Jr., ordered an in-depth review of the
company.
   Brig. Gen. Robert W. Drewes, who led the eight-man team that
conducted the review, told a House panel the California-based
company was beset by problems in nearly every aspect of its
business.
   Drewes identified weaknesses in systems engineering; the
transition from research and development to production; software
management; subcontract management; organization and personnel; and
business systems, which includes cost and schedule estimates.
   ``Name one Northrop program that is in good shape based on what
the Air Force or taxpayers tolerate?'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
asked Drewes.
   ``All the programs I looked at, there were some problems,'' the
Air Force official said.
   A Northrop spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the company
is taking steps to correct problems.
   ``We still have things to do, but the recognition by the Air
Force that changes have been made and are being made is a favorable
indication of the direction the company is moving,'' the spokesman
said.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams told reporters that
Northrop ``remains an important supplier to the United States and
we will obviously look very closely at any problem we have with any
contractor.''
   The Air Force review examined major Northrop programs, including
the B-2, the ALQ-135 radar system for the F-15 jet fighter and
several classified programs.
   Drewes said, however, that his eight-man team did not delve into
problems associated with federal investigations of Northrop.
   Justice Department officials told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations in July that the
California company should be barred from government business.
   The officials described how Northrop falsified reports on the
air-launched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the
Harrier AV-8B jet. The company's action led to its guilty plea in
February on 34 charges of fraud and a fine of $17 million, the
largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense contractor.
   Drewes told the panel he was not aware of the 34 charges against
Northrop, prompting an angry response from several lawmakers.
   ``Do you all operate over there in a vacuum?'' asked Rep. James
Slattery, D-Kan.
   Drewes said he avoided areas that were the subject of ongoing or
completed federal investigations to avoid complicating the
inquiries.

Florida</HEAD>

   A `blue norther' dropped the temperature 26 degrees in a
half-hour Tuesday in Texas as strong wind whipped arctic air into
Texas behind a cold front crossing the south-central and eastern
part of the nation.
   Harlingen, Texas, reported wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph with the
passage of the cold front. The temperature plunged from 94 degrees
to 68 in about 30 minutes at Brownsville during the afternoon.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s across much
of the south-central section of the country as well as the middle
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes region as strong northwesterly
wind behind the front ushered in cold air.
   Temperatures dropped below freezing overnight across much of the
Plateau and Rocky Mountain region.
   Tuesday's record low temperatures included 2 degrees at Laramie,
Wyo., Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states; 42 at Redding, Calif.;
and 20 at Valentine, Neb.
   A freeze warning was posted into Wednesday morning for the
west-central mountains and northern third of New Mexico, the Texas
Panhandle, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and western and central Kansas.
A frost advisory was issued for the eastern third of Kansas,
eastern Nebraska, southern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.
   Readings in the teens and single digits were reported at a few
locations in Colorado and Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended over coastal Texas and parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley. Showers prevailed from the middle
Mississippi Valley through the Ohio Valley to the lower Great Lakes
region.
   There were showers and a few thunderstorms over southeastern
Georgia and the Florida peninsula. Light rain and drizzle were over
parts of New York state and northern New England.
   Heavier rainfall totals included an 1.38 inches at Key West,
Fla., 1.17 inches at Homestead, Fla., 1.10 inches at Victoria,
Texas, and 1.08 inches at Shreveport, La.
   Temperatures remained in the 40s and 50s overnight in much of
the Northeast but dipped into the 20s and 30s from the High Plains
to the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Michigan.

   A two-penny tax on home heating oil and a
delay in unemployment benefits, two deficit-cutting proposals that
drew widespread objections, are likely to be dropped from the plan
about to be crafted in Congress.
   The impact on Medicare recipients will almost certainly be
cushioned. But taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol almost
certainly will rise by the time Congress fills in the blanks on its
$500 billion deficit reduction package.
   And a debate about which taxes to raise - and whether to cut the
capital gains tax - will move to the front.
   Each proposed spending cut and tax increase will be debated
intensely over the next 10 days as Congress struggles to complete
the deficit accord by an Oct. 19 deadline, lawmakers involved in
the effort predicted on Tuesday,
   ``It's going to be the equal of the struggle we've had so far,''
said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., who has been in the middle of this
year's budget negotiations.
   The plan will be crafted in more than a dozen congressional
committees, and in a Congress where nerves have been frayed by
months of grappling with the deficit. The conservative and moderate
wings of the House GOP have clashed bitterly in recent weeks, and
many Republicans feel wounded by what they considered rough
lobbying by White House aides during last week's fight over the
first budget pact.
   ``I'm nervous that it's made Republicans in the House less
effective,'' Frenzel said.
   Whatever the difficulties, there is no choice but to go ahead.
   Agreement between President Bush and Congress on the bare bones
deficit agreement ended a budget impasse early Tuesday, and led to
legislation restoring the federal government's ability to operate
normally. Another shutdown is threatened for Oct. 19 if there is no
agreement on the fine points of the $500 billion plan to cut
domestic spending, trim the military and raise taxes over five
years.
   Some of the toughest bargaining is expected to be over taxes.
Bush said for the first time Tuesday that he could accept higher
tax rates on the wealthy in exchange for a cut in the capital gains
tax he has long campaigned for.
   Democrats have long resisted the cut in the capital gains tax
rate unless it was blended with higher taxes on the wealthy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Bush had
``apparently come around to our point of view,'' and aides to Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee, said he was endorsing the changes as part of a
deficit-reduction plan on which the committee was to begin working
Wednesday.
   In past years, Bentsen had endorsed taxing capital gains - which
are profits from the sale of investments - at lower rates than
apply to wages. But he has opposed such a change recently because
most of the benefit would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a
year.
   Republicans also will push for renewal of expiring tax
provisions that help companies that perform research and
experimentation and for housing credits for low-income people.
   Democrats are serving notice they will seek deeper cuts in
defense spending than the earlier plan envisioned. ``Is the
military going to help with the burden sharing or not?'' asked
liberal Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   For their part, Republicans are expected to fight elsewhere for
the deepest spending cuts possible, and the most modest tax
increases.
   Congressional negotiators will be building on the remains of a
deficit-reduction plan that was rejected last week in the House.
   ``Obviously, we're trying to get to where we don't hit the
average-income people so much,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.
   Two items that prompted objections from House members last week
are expected t be excluded from the final package, according to
lawmakers and aides who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   One would have placed a 2-cent-per-gallon tax on home-heating
oil, and was vociferously opposed by lawmakers from Northern
states. The other would have required states to delay unemployment
benefits for two weeks, an idea that drew cries from legislators
from states where the economy is soft.
   There is a general agreement that Medicare, which provides
health care for the elderly and handicapped, will end up taking a
major hit.
   The pact that Bush and congressional leaders had agreed to would
have slated Medicare for $60 billion in savings, half of it coming
from reduced benefits and higher costs for participants. Lawmakers
say the new package will probably reduce those cuts to the $40
billion to $45 billion range, with most of the savings coming from
reduced payments to doctors and hospitals.
   Likely to remain in the plan are higher taxes on gasoline,
alcohol and tobacco, although the amounts are up for grabs. The
reason for them remaining - they were merely minor irritants when
the House rejected the measure.
   ``On the floor, they weren't much of a problem,'' said Rep. Rod
Chandler, R-Wash., a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.
``Why do something for an area that wasn't much of a problem.'''
   The rejected pact would have boosted the 9-cent-per-gallon
gasoline tax by 12 cents and raised the 3-cent-per-bottle tax on
wine to about 25 cents. It would have added 8 cents to the 16 cent
tax on a pack of cigarettes, and brought the 16-cent tax on beer
six-packs to 36 cents.
   The new plan contains other broad categories of cuts that
lawmakers will have to assign to specific programs. Agriculture
stands to lose $13 billion over the next five years, federal
retirees are due an $8 billion reduction, and the Guarantee Student
Loan programs is bracing for a $2 billion cut.
   Defense is another question. The budget pact seemed to call for
about $10 billion in military reductions next year, bringing
defense spending to about $296 billion. But liberals say they would
like to chop more out of Pentagon spending.

<HEAD>Depleted Swedish Academy Prepares to Award Literary Prize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Swedish Academy, depleted by the
resignation of three members and under fire for some of its past
selections, will announce the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday.
   The academy has refused to accept last year's resignations of
Lars Gyllensten, Kerstin Ekman and Werner Aspenstrom, saying
members are named for life, and academy prestige would be shattered
if anyone were allowed to resign.
   None of the three took part in this year's deliberations, and it
is unclear whether their presence would have changed the decision.
   Gyllensten, 69, who had been with the 18-member academy for 23
years, and Ms. Ekman, at 57 its youngest member, quit to protest
the organization's reaction to Iranian death threats against
British author Salman Rushdie.
   They said the academy's general statement, condemning censorship
without referring specifically to Rushdie, was weak and politically
motivated.
   With them, the 204-year-old institution lost one of its most
knowledgeable members and one of only two women.
   Author Aspenstrom, 71, said his reasons for resigning were
different, but indicated support for a stronger statement on the
Rushdie case.
   ``The Rushdie-case was the last drop, but the crevice in trust
had been deepening for some years,'' Gyllensten said as the academy
made its final decision on who will win the 4 million kronor
($704,000) prize.
   Ms. Ekman said that if the more conservative majority continued
to regard expression of new opinions as a challenge to its power,
``the old institution'' would become sterile.
   Gyllensten has said the academy should become more active in the
issues being debated in modern literary circles.
   The academy has been pressured for years to award the prize to a
woman. Six female laureates have been chosen since the prize was
first awarded in 1901 under an endowment from Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish inventor of dynamite.
   Swedish-German writer Nelly Sachs was the last woman winner, in
1966.
   Nobel specified in his 1896 will that the prizes should be
awarded with no regard to nationality. The most frequent criticism
of the academy, however, has been that it focused on the
accomplishments of Western European and North American writers.
   The academy took steps in the last two decades to draw attention
to authors who write for a limited language group, but drew fire
for that, too.
   It selected an Arab-language writer, Naguib Mahfouz, for the
first time in 1988. Critics then noted that no Chinese writer has
ever been chosen, despite China's 3,000-year-old literary
tradition.
   The academy says it never considers politics. Its citations for
Mahfouz and for last year's winner, Spaniard Camilo Jose Cela, draw
attention, however, to works their governments had banned.
   British author Anthony Burgess has complained that the prize is
awarded on the strength of a single book, although the academy says
it is for the author's body of work.
   ``It is inevitably one novel that sticks in the jury's
collective brain,'' Burgess wrote in a magazine article this month.
``The wrong novel has consistently been chosen.''
   King Gustav III founded the academy in 1786 to protect and
promote Swedish language and literature. It has maintained a
tradition of grandeur and secrecy behind the 18th-century walls of
the Stock Exchange building in Stockholm's Old Town.
   Caj Lundgren, culture editor at the Svenska Dagbladet daily,
said the academy ``has always been the target of criticism, simply
because it's an ancient type of institution.
   ``It has been criticized for being old-fashioned and
stiff-legged and some may take . . . (the rift) as a kind of proof
for this. Others see it as a sign of life that members actually
protest and ask to leave.''

<HEAD>Investigators Call Sexual Harassment Common at Naval Academy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sexual harassment of female students at the
Naval Academy is widespread, and some victims don't complain openly
for fear of reprisal, according to an internal academy report
released Tuesday.
   ``In such a climate it is not surprising that some midshipmen
have lost the ability to distinguish a blatant incident of sexual
harassment from routine pranks,'' it said.
   The report by a seven-member panel of academy faculty, military
staff and midshipmen said immediate action is needed to correct the
conditions allowing mistreatment of women.
   ``Most midshipmen readily acknowledge women midshipmen are not
accepted as equals in the (academy),'' said the report by the
academy's Women Midshipmen Study Group. ``This lack of acceptance
has created an environment in which steady, low-level sexual
harassment passes as normal operating procedure in company areas
and classrooms alike.''
   The report was one of several special inquiries prompted by a
hazing incident at the academy last December in which a female
student was handcuffed by male midshipmen to a urinal as other men
jeered and took photographs. The woman, Gwen M. Dreyer, a
second-year student, resigned from the academy last May, citing her
humiliation and anger at the way the academy responded to it.
   The Navy on Tuesday released copies of the internal report as
well as other studies that were reviewed by a special committee
appointed by the academy's Board of Visitors. The committee was
comprised of Board Chairman James M. Cannon, Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md.; Rep. Helen D. Bentley, R-Md., and other outsiders.
   Mrs. Mikulski issued a statement urging swift action to correct
conditions at the Annapolis institution.
   ``There is a real and continuing problem at the U.S. Naval
Academy,'' she said. ``Women are neither accepted as equals nor
treated with respect. The Annapolis administration - from the top
down - must act swiftly and decisively to end this harassment.''
   Mrs. Mikulski said she was troubled by the investigators'
finding that a vocal minority of midshipmen, officers, staff and
graduates believe women should not be midshipmen.
   ``This attitude is antiquated, unrealistic and unacceptable,''
she said.
   At the Pentagon, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III said
``prompt action will be forthcoming'' to address the concerns
raised by the inquiry reports.
   ``I am confident that as the result of these exhaustive studies,
necessary corrective actions will enable the Naval Academy to build
on its impressive 145-year history with a renewed sense of purpose
and mission,'' Garrett said in a written statement.
   In its own report, the Board of Visitors special committee
offered a series of recommendations for improving the treatment of
female students, including adoption of a ``zero tolerance policy to
end all forms of discrimination.''
   The panel also recommended imposing severe punishment for sexual
harassment, sexual discrimination and hazing. It should be made
more clear to academy students that they will be kicked out if they
are found to have engaged in such violations of academy policy, the
panel said.

<HEAD>Magazine: Woman Spy Most Serious Case Ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of counter-espionage for
the former East German government had access to top-level
intelligence reports and could represent the most serious
infiltration by a foreign agent, a magazine reported Tuesday.
   The Hamburg-based Stern magazine identified the woman only as
``Gabriele G.,'' 47, and said she had worked since 1973 in the
former West German intelligence service's headquarters in Pullach
near Munich, where secret reports were regularly prepared. They
included weekly intelligence summaries for Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The woman was arrested Sept. 30 following a tip from the former
East German secret police, the magazine reported.
   The report quoted security experts as saying the woman's
activities were far more serious than the 1974 case of spy Guenter
Guillaume, who worked as a top aide for former Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
   Revelations that Guillaume was an East German agent forced
Brandt's resignation.
   Also Tuesday, German television reported there was another
serious espionage case in the Federal Office for the Defense of the
Constitution, but did not provide details.
   Stern said the woman apparently began working for the East
German secret police in 1968 when she completed her political
science doctorate and paid a visit to East Germany.
   The magazine said the suspect routinely made copies of the
secret reports and gave them to the Stasi, the name of the East
German intelligence service.
   ``For the investigators the only question that remains open is
whether former (East German) state security chief Erich Mielke
received the West German intelligence service report to read before
or after Helmut Kohl,'' Stern said.
   Excerpts from the report, which will appear in Stern's Thursday
editions, were provided early to some news media.
   A spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe confirmed a Stern report that the office had sought the
arrest of ``Gabriele G.'' on suspicion of high treason, which
carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   ``However, the investigating judge issuing the arrest warrant
reduced that to `secret agent activities,' '' spokesman
Hans-Juergen Foerster said.
   Foerster said the investigation against the suspect is
continuing, and that it is still not clear what level of charges
would be filed.
   ``But we do see it as a very grave case,'' the spokesman said.
   Retired U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad has been the only spy
sentenced to life in prison by a West German court since World War
II.
   Conrad was convicted in June of passing military secrets to
Hungary and Czechoslovakia from 1975 to 1985 in return for $1.2
million.
   Foerster declined to comment on the other case reported by the
ARD television network on its evening news program, but said that
his office was likely to make a statement on Wednesday.

   On the spot where Lenin once spoke, the focus
Tuesday was on Lennon.
   Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful
pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and
ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have
turned 50 on Tuesday. State radio broadcast his music and
interviews about him.
   Two concerts devoted to the songwriter, guitarist and singer,
who was shot to death in 1980, were held in Moscow.
   Even the staid state television program ``Vremya'' got into act.
An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news,
reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song
``Imagine,'' an ``anthem of peace.'' The broadcast ended with an
instrumental version of ``Yesterday'' playing as temperatures from
around the nation rolled across the screen.
   The celebration was a dramatic turnabout from Soviet
authorities' repression of Beatles fans and supression of their
music in earlier times. Their music was banned and the Soviet press
condemned them. A 1964 article, for instance, commented, ``These
bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.''
   About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans,
flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall in
northeastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music. A
plaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennon's near
namesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, had
spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.
   Inside, fans listened to recordings of Lennon's music, attended
a concert of about a dozen Soviet rock bands, bought his albums and
posters and reflected on his life.
   ``He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol of
honesty, talent, devotion to his ideals, notion of love, equality
between people and goodness,'' said Irina Dykomkina, the
21-year-old secretary of the Sgt. Pepper's Club, a Soviet Beatles
fan club formed two years ago.
   Lennon's music, she said, crosses borders easily.
   ``His music is so sincere, it's so understandable, even to
people who don't know English. They feel the music.''
   Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - the
Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to
Lennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a
rebel, like many of them, and was a ``difficult teen-ager.''
   ``The cops would have locked him up many times,'' said Trushkin,
who helped organize the concert.
   Tuesday's concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party.
Balloons floated down from the balconies as a tape of Lennon's
song, ``Starting Over,'' played. The stage was adorned with a
painting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutouts of the Fab Four
in front of the British flag.
   ``Oorah! Oorah!'' shouted the audience, which included a few
soldiers in uniform. Onstage, the groups Sprint, Quiet Hour and
Optimal Variant played in Beatles style but were joined by a group
that didn't quite fit in the genre, an American-style country
ensemble that wore plaid vests and performed ``Night Train to
Memphis.''

<HEAD>U.S. Pushing for Consulates in Soviet States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is looking into setting
up consulates in Soviet republics where strong independence
movements have emerged and expects to have an office in Kiev within
a few weeks, an official said Tuesday.
   Each office would likely mean a new Soviet consulate in an
American city outside Washington because the Soviet Foreign Affairs
Ministry would insist on reciprocity, said Assistant Secretary of
State Raymond Seitz.
   A Soviet consulate is to be opened in New York when the Kiev
office is approved, he said.
   Consuls are officials who represent their government on all
kinds of affairs not connected with the diplomatic,
government-to-government dialogue - for example, issuing travel
visas, replacing lost passports or finding lawyers for those
arrested. They are generally supervised by the embassy in the
capital.
   ``This is an idea whose time has come,'' Seitz told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``We're considering recognizing that there are now centers that
are taking on their own characteristics in the Soviet Union and
that a presence there would be helpful and interesting from our
point of view,'' Seitz said.
   Seitz said that no formal talks are under way to establish other
consulates, but the idea has been raised in ``a very informal
manner.''
   The Soviets currently have an embassy in Washington, a mission
to the United Nations in New York and a consulate in San Francisco.
The United States has a Moscow embassy and a consulate in
Leningrad.
   The Kiev office would be in the heart of the Ukraine, which
recently has declared its residents immune from conscription into
the Soviet military.
   Seitz said six months ago the Ukraine was one of the last
regions analysts expected to show a break-away spirit. He said U.S.
officials have been trying to set up a consular office there for
more than 10 years.
   ``My guess is that if all of these trends continue for the next
three or four years, we will see a Soviet Union almost
unrecognizable from the one that we have become familiar with,''
Seitz said.
   He said conditions vary for each of the union's constituent
republics but now ``each of them has declared a degree of a kind of
sovereignty.''
   U.S. officials have regular contact with leaders of the 15
Soviet republics whenever they can have access to them, he said.
   Seitz said if consulates are set up in leading regional cities,
they would likely be only small offices of two or three people
without any classified operations.
   He said consulates could be established in the Baltic states,
among others. The United States has never formally recognized the
1940 Soviet annexations of independent Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia, and still accredits diplomats representing the last
independent governments at legations and consulates in the United
States.
   Seitz said conditions in Lithuania after the republic's leaders
declared independence from the central government earlier this year
seems to have ``passed the crisis point.'' A trade embargo by
Moscow has been lifted and dialogue has begun, Seitz noted.
   Asked about reports that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is
losing control, Seitz noted that the Soviet leader has acquired new
decree-making powers and added, ``It becomes a regular event to
speculate about Mr. Gorbachev's future before each grand challenges
that he faces, and after each grand challenge he emerges with his
political authority intact.''

   Gov. Kay Orr said Tuesday she won't campaign
for re-election in a county bitterly divided over a proposed
radioactive waste warehouse because her life has been threatened.
   Boyd County, a sparsely populated ranching area on the state's
northern edge, has been in turmoil since officials began
considering it as a possible home for low-level radioactive waste
from five states. A rancher who opposes the plan is on a hunger
strike.
   The Nebraska State Patrol said a letter was received in early
August ``that contained some implied threats.'' Patrol spokesman
Jeff Hanson declined to release any further details, saying the
matter was under investigation.
   Hanson said the letter lacked some elements needed before
authorities could charge anyone with making terroristic threats.
   Orr spokesman Doug Parrott said he understands that the threat
is related to the nuclear waste dispute.
   Mrs. Orr said she knows who made the threat but wouldn't
disclose the name. She said she had hoped the situation in Boyd
County wouldn't deteriorate to the point of threats.
   ``There are a lot of things that you consider when you step into
a public office,'' Mrs. Orr said. ``I think most of it was pretty
well understood by Bill (her husband) and me.
   ``It's dismaying to think that we have gotten to this point that
people lose faith and confidence in their government.''
   The proposed waste site lies about two miles outside Butte, a
village of about 500 people. Supporters have welcomed the money the
dump may bring. Opponents have said they fear accidents and
long-term effects of the radioactive waste.
   US Ecology, a waste site developer chosen by the Central
Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Commission, has
applied to the state for permits to build the waste warehouse.
   The reinforced concrete warehouse near the South Dakota border
would hold waste from the five states that make up the commission:
Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas.
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ben Nelson's campaign
manager, Sonny Foster, said it was the first he had heard of any
threat against Mrs. Orr. He said it had ``absolutely nothing'' to
do with the Nelson campaign.
   ``I think that I can say on the behalf of Ben Nelson that we
don't feel that threatening people is part of the political process
and there's no way that Ben Nelson would ever condone that kind of
activity,'' Foster said.
   Nelson has visited Boyd County and has said that he is concerned
about the diisions in the community, Foster said.
   One rancher who opposes the waste site has been on a hunger
strike for more than three weeks.
   Lowell Fisher of Spencer, who said Tuesday he had lost 29 pounds
since his fast began on Sept. 17, said he didn't believe the threat
against Mrs. Orr was a serious one.
   ``I think it's stupid but if you have enough people who are
emotionally upset, they say something,'' Fisher said.
   Fisher said he intends to continue his water-only diet until the
governor tells the waste compact commission that the community
objects to the waste site or holds a special election to see if
there is.
   An aide to the governor has said Mrs. Orr lacks the power to
call such an election and noted that the village board has
supported the waste site plans.

<TEXT>
   Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam'' painted on
the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel contains an image
misunderstood for 478 years - a huge brain that symbolizes God
bestowing intellect on man, a doctor says.
   The fresco, completed in 1512 for Pope Julius II, shows Adam and
God reaching toward one another, arms outstretched, fingers almost
touching. Many scholars have interpreted the painting to mean God
bestowed life on man.
   But Frank Lynn Meshberger, a doctor at St. John's Medical Center
in Anderson, Ind., says Adam's eyes are already open, suggesting
he's alive. He contends Michelangelo intended the painting to
portray God giving man the gift of intellect.
   ``Look at the image that surrounds God and the angels,''
Meshberger wrote in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association. ``This image is the shape of a brain.''
   One art historian was skeptical.
   ``Holy mackerel! I never heard tell of such a thing,'' said Olan
Rand, a professor of art at Northwestern University in Evanston.
   ``I always thought it was a cloak,'' Rand said Tuesday. ``I'd
better go look at it again.''
   Meshberger said his conclusion is obvious - particularly if you
studied a picture of the fresco following classes on dissecting a
human brain. He had just finished dissecting and drawing a brain in
a medical school class in 1969 when he happened across a three-page
fold-out photo of the painting in a magazine.
   Meshberger said he waited 20 years to publish an article on it
because he was busy establishing himself as a doctor and had little
time to do research on Michelangelo's background.
   ``As a medical student, I was quite busy and, at the time,
thought it was an interesting observation but didn't have time to
look into it,'' he said.
   Meshberger said that when he began researching the question
years later, he learned that Michelangelo had deep religious
beliefs and used to dissect cadavers to study the human form for
his art.
   Other art lovers might have reached the same conclusion before
this century except they didn't have the benefit of the clear
images seen in modern photography, Meshberger said. He also said
artists who would have had access to the painting generally weren't
skilled in anatomy.
   He plans to give a lecture on his theory at a two-day science
reporters conference in Boston this week and expects doctors
attending to debate his interpretation.

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Klaus ended with a whimper off
Florida's Atlantic coast Tuesday, causing no damage but bringing
welcome rain to the drought-parched state.
   Klaus ran into a low pressure area over Cuba and tore apart,
pulling its top wind speed down to no more than 35 mph, said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.
   At the same time, Tropical Storm Lili in the mid Atlantic
weakened and lost its center and rotation, although it still had
high wind. It was reclassified a nontropical storm front, the
hurricane center said.
   Klaus left six dead and more than 500 homeless on the island of
Martinique during its trek through the Caribbean, and briefly was
classified as a minimal hurricane.
   But other than coastal erosion and blustery weather that left
beaches treacherous, the system's effect on the United States was
expected to be positive.
   ``The good news is it's going to bring a lot of rain over
Florida,'' said Sheets.
   The state has suffered two years of drought, and while rain has
returned to normal in some parts of Florida, the water supply is
still so low that even Klaus' remnants are not expected to end the
shortage, said Ann Overton, spokeswoman for the South Florida Water
Management District.
   By the last hurricane center advisory at noon EDT Tuesday, the
depression left by Klaus was centered near 24.0 north latitude and
76.0 west longitude, or about 115 miles southeast of Nassau in the
Bahamas. It was heading west-northwest at about 15 mph and was
expected to continue on that course.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Consider Pricing Dispute Involving Natural Gas
Pipelines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to hear an
appeal of a lower court ruling that a federal plan for natural gas
pipeline companies to recover lost revenues is illegal.
   Federal regulators must now devise a new plan for pipeline
companies to recover millions of dollars in losses dating back
nearly a decade.
   Retail natural gas prices in some areas may increase, while
elsewhere they could be unaffected or decline slightly depending on
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new cost recovery plan,
industry experts said.
   The issue involves attempts by natural gas pipeline companies to
charge customers - often utilities - for costs incurred in the late
1970s and early '80s when gas supplies fluctuated dramatically and
pipelines were tied into binding contracts that required them to
buy gas they no longer needed.
   The pipeline companies are trying to regain more than $3.5
billion by imposing surcharges under a complex recovery plan
approved by the FERC.
   That plan, however, was found to be illegal by a federal appeals
court.
   A spokeswoman for FERC said the agency would have no comment on
the court decision except to say that staff members were trying to
work out a new cost recovery plan as directed by the appeals court.
   ``We are disappointed by the Supreme Court's denial (of the
petition),'' said Jerald Halvorsen, president of the Interstate
Natural Gas Association, which represents natural gas pipeline
companies. Many of the pipeline companies had welcomed the FERC
recovery plan as a way to assure at least partial recovery of the
costs they incurred during the early 1980s.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
had said in a case involving the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. that
the company's surcharge under the FERC plan amounted to a
retroactive rate increase and was illegal.
   The case involved only Tennessee Gas, but is expected to serve
as a precedent in other cases involving pipelines, industry experts
said. Tennessee gas has sought the recovery of about $300 million,
attorneys familiar with the case said.
   The surcharges imposed by Tennessee Gas had been challenged by a
number of utilities and another pipeline, the Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp., which buys gas from Tennessee Gas and sells it
to utilities. They argued that they were required under the FERC
formula to assume too much of the cost-recovery burden, while other
utilities were paying no surcharge.
   Columbia Gas serves utilities across much of the Mid-Atlantic
states into New England and as far west as Ohio and Kentucky.

<TEXT>
   Four more senior KGB officers have leveled public
charges of corruption and favoritism in the intelligence service,
according to the independent Interfax news service.
   The allegations, following similar charges by former KGB Gen.
Oleg Kalugin, come as the national parliament is considering
legislation to ban all police, military and KGB employees from
membership and involvement with the Communist Party.
   Interfax said the four issued an open letter to the public and
lawmakers saying that ``without a cardinal reorganization of the
KGB there can be no positive changes in Soviet life because state
security bodies remain an armed unit of the party.''
   The letter demanded ``depolitization in the army, the KGB, the
Interior Ministry and their law enforcement bodies, speedy adoption
after a broad national debate of laws on state security ... and the
subordination of judicial authorities only to law.''
   The letter was signed by Maj. Valery Bulychyov, Maj. Sergei
Voronin, Lt. Col. Alexander Kichikhin and Lt. Col. Vladimir
Morozov, said Interfax. It did not say when the letter was dated.
   Lawmakers debated wording of a bill Tuesday that says law
enforcement officers should ``be guided in their official
activities by the requirements of law and shall not be held bound
by the decisions of parties or mass public movements of which they
are members.''
   Kalugin, who has retired, has won a seat in parliament since his
statements earlier this year blasting the KGB. He also has filed a
lawsuit against the agency's directors.

   Air Canada will lay off 2,800 of its 23,000
employees and cut routes to Europe and the Far East because of
rising fuel costs and the recession, unions representing the
workers said Tuesday.
   Customer service workers - which include baggage handlers - will

their workforce, said the sources, who requested anonymity.
   The unions said company officials told them the layoffs would
include 225 pilots, 440 flight attendants, 350 maintenance workers,
425 ticket agents and 265 members of the management and clerical
staff.
   Dates for the layoffs and severance packages were not
immediately known.
   Flights to Athens, Greece; Lisbon, Portugal; and Madrid, Spain,
as well as Bombay, India, and Singapore will be cut and the airline
will sell some aircraft and close its Halifax, Nova Scotia,
maintenance base.
   Canada, with 25 million residents, has been hit in recent months
by rising interest rates as well as increased costs for fuel in the
aftermath of the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2 of Kuwait.

   Gov. Rudy Perpich, who bristles at news
stories about his own family, says his opponent's dispute over
child-support payments is fair political game because his rival
lacks a record in public office.
   The Democratic governor said Tuesday he has no intention of
backing off from his strategy. Republican challenger Jon Grunseth
says it amounts to character assassination.
   ``I have a public record and he doesn't,'' said Perpich, who has
held office for 30 of the last 34 years, including a record 10-year
stint as governor.
   ``What he does as a private citizen reflects on what he'll do, I
think, as governor,'' Perpich said of his campaign references to
Grunseth's court battles with his former wife over child support.
``So I'm saying ... he wasn't meeting his family obligations, his
first family. It took four court orders.''
   Grunseth said much of his dispute with his first wife stems from
his decision to withhold $50 a month from his $1,700 monthly
maintenance payments to protest her refusal to remove their
daughter from the Minneapolis Children's Theatre School, where a
sex abuse scandal had surfaced.
   The governor said Grunseth invited the close scrutiny by saying
during a debate in August with his primary opponents that ``my life
is an open book.''
   Perpich said he is not trying to make a campaign issue out of
Grunseth being divorced. ``There's a lot of people who are
divorced, even my own brother,'' he said.
   In 1974, the last time he ran for office, Grunseth made a bid
for a U.S. House seat, but came up short with 45 percent of the
vote.
   Grunseth, a 44-year-old businessman, said he deeply resents
Perpich's attempts to publicize his court dispute with his first
wife. Grunseth was divorced in 1983 and remarried in 1984.
   ``I think that he's engaging in willful and deliberate character
assassination,'' Grunseth said.
   Perpich supporters also have claimed Grunseth was late on
several property tax payments over a 16-year period. But Grunseth
aides say he wasn't responsible fr most of the delinquencies.
   Charles Backstrom, a political science professor at the
University of Minnesota for 30 years, said he can't recall a
gubernatorial campaign where so much attention has been devoted to
a candidate's personal life.
   The governor has objected strongly in the past to news stories
focusing on his family. Late last year, angered by a newspaper
article that suggested they family lived in too grand a style,
Perpich and his wife, Lola, proposed selling the governor's mansion
and giving the proceeds to the homeless.
   Next, Perpich turned in his leased Lincoln Town Car after a
television reporter called it a limousine. Then, after a newspaper
reported that the State Patrol had given his daughter rides to
concerts, stores and her office, he canceled his bodyguard.
   In the current campaign, Perpich also has called for Grunseth to
release copies of his income tax returns for the past several years
as Perpich has done.
   Grunseth has refused, but offered to release a summary of his
returns if Perpich agreed to five regional debates.
   Perpich said he would not participate in two of three scheduled
debates until Grunseth releases his tax returns.

<HEAD>Former Cabinet Member Says European Community Shirked Gulf Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Cabinet minister who
resigned after likening the European Community to Hitler said
Tuesday that member nations neglected their responsibilities in
Persian Gulf crisis because they are ``obsessed'' with closer
political union.
   ``Some member states did not want to get involved in the
international force; many were tardy in their response to it,''
said former Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley at the
annual conference of the governing Conservative Party.
   ``It shows that many on the Continent remain obsessed by
political union, neglecting their responsibilities toward the rest
of the world,'' he said.
   Earlier, party chairman Kenneth Baker opened the four-day
conference by saying Britain had proved itself America's most loyal
ally in the gulf.
   ``We are not a nation that shirks its duty ... that forsakes its
friends,'' Baker told the 5,000 delegates who gathered in a
seafront convention center under tight security prompted by fears
of an Irish Republican Army attack.
   ``In our long history, we've had to take up burdens which others
have found too heavy,'' added Baker. ``And when an old ally and
friend, the United States of America, calls for our help they do
not call in vain.''
   Britain, the first Western U.S. ally to send units to the gulf
after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, projects its force in the gulf
could reach 15,000 troops.
   Ridley, a member of Parliament and close associate of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, reiterated the anti-German overtones of
his remarks in July, when he accused Germany of pushing EC monetary
union as a means of dominating Europe and said giving up Britain's
sovereignty would be like surrendering to the Nazis.
   He said Tuesday that a single currency for the European
Community ``would be a disaster.''
   ``The history of Western Europe cannot be belied,'' said Ridley.
``Germany has always striven, first to unite German-speaking people
and then to build up its strength, which tends to dominate the
western half of the Continent.''
   Baker and other Cabinet ministers defended the government's
decision last week to link the pound to the community's other major
currencies. The move fulfilled Britain's obligation to the first
stage of a plan for economic and monetary union.
   European Commission President Jacques Delors has expressed fears
that Britain will still attempt to block the proposed final stages,
including a single currency and one central banking system.
   In addition to Britain, EC members include Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
   As the Conservative Party meetings began, sharpshooters were
posted on the roof of the convention center and truckloads of
police reinforcements rolled through Bournemouth, about 100 miles
southwest of London.
   Fears of an IRA assassination attempt on Mrs. Thatcher have
grown since the group killed a close Thatcher political associate
in a July car bombing and attempted to kill a government minister
by planting a bomb at London conference last month.
   The IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, exploded a bomb in the hotel where Mrs. Thatcher was
staying during the 1984 Conservative conference, killing five
people.
   The Conservative government, which has trailed Labor in opinion
poll ratings for more than a year, seeks to lower interest rates
and inflation - now 10.6 percent - before the next election.
   On Monday, the government lowered interest rates one point to 14
percent. Mrs. Thatcher must call an election by mid-1992. But she
may do so next year if inflation and interest rates fall.

   Muscovites might one day visit a Soviet version
of the hotel President Bush officially calls home.
   A Soviet-born entrepreneur who lives in Houston says he has
reached agreement with Moscow city officials to develop a 300-room
Houstonian Hotel, with health center, about two miles from the
Kremlin.
   The project would be named the Houstonian because Soviets tend
to associate quality with anything from the United States, Alex
Genin said Monday. Many Soviet citizens are familiar with Houston
because of NASA's Johnson Space Center, he said.
   President Bush lists the Texas Houstonian, not the White House,
as his official address.
   And Genin, managing director of Eastern Credit Limited, said
Soviet tourism officials recently visited Houston's Houstonian
Hotel and liked it.
   The land and buildings would be owned by the government and
leased to the hotel operators for 50 years, Genin said. The
business would be a joint venture between the Soviet government and
Eastern Credit.

   Greenpeace complained Tuesday that Soviet
officials were ignoring their requests about the fate of 34
activists and a ship seized by the KGB near a Soviet nuclear
weapons test site.
   Those seized Monday included four activists who were last seen
heading toward the test site at Novaya Zemlya in the Barents Sea,
said Rebecca Johnson, spokeswoman for the world environmentalist
organization in London.
   Greenpeace identified the four as Ted Wood of Hollywood, Calif.;
Jorn Haye of Germany; Jeane Ni Ghormain of Ireland; and Bjoern
Okern of Norway.
   ``We are being stonewalled by the Soviet authorities,'' Ms.
Johnson said. ``Their refusal to answer to the status of our ship
parallels their refusal to talk about nuclear testing.'
   The ship, with 28 Western activists and six Soviets aboard, had
permission to tour the Soviet arctic, Greenpeace said.
   Soviet officials have not commented since Monday, when the
official Tass news agency said a Coast Guard icebreaker, under
command of the KGB intelligence service, fired across the bow of
the motor vessel Greenpeace off Novaya Zemlya and seized the craft.
   Tass said the ship would be taken to the Kola Gulf for an
inquiry, but gave no details about the crew.
   They were seized just after the four were dispatched to the
island to trek several miles to the test site, which Greenpeace
asserts is being used despite Soviet assures of a unilateral
moratorium on weapons tests. The four carried radios and radiation
detection equipment to try to document the tests and protest
against them, Ms. Johnson said.
   She said Greenpeace representatives met Tuesday in Moscow with
Soviet officials, including a KGB press officer, but got no
answers.
   On Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said the
vessel was detained for ``deliberate violation of the state border
of the U.S.S.R., failure to obey border authorities, landing people
at unpermitted places and an attempt to enter an area closed to
navigation.''
   Before communications with the ship were lost, Greenpeace
activist Steve Shallhorn said from Oslo, Norway, that about 15
border guards had boarded the 190-foot, Dutch-registered vessel. He
said the icebreaker threatened to fire on the Greenpeace ship,
which was about four miles from the two-island group.
   Ms. Johnson, who is international test ban coordinator for
Greenpeace in London, said, ``We informed the Soviets early on that
we were sending people ashore.''
   ``Our expectation is that everyone is in fact safe but we want
communication back with the ship so we can verify that,'' she said.
   She said Greenpeace planned to ask the U.S., British, Dutch and
German governments for help.
   The Soviets had told Greenpeace to steer clear of Novaya Zemlya,
which is about 370 miles from Norway and was a primary Soviet
nuclear test site from 1958 to 1963. Environmental groups claim it
was last used in 1988.
   On Tuesday, a member of the parliament of the Russian
Federation, the largest Soviet republic, demanded that authorities
investigate plans to test nuclear devices at Novaya Zemlya, the
independent news agency Interfax reported.

   President Bush appeared to open the door
Tuesday to higher income taxes on the wealthy as part of a budget
compromise but later abandoned that strategy under pressure from
Republican senators, senators and officials said.
   The quick turnabout came after Bush met with GOP senators and
was told not to try to trade lower capital gains taxes, which he
wants, for higher income taxes on the wealthiest Americans, which
Democrats want.
   Bush initially voiced a new readiness to bargain with
congressional Democrats on the long-divisive tax issue after
signing a temporary spending bill that ended a three-day government
shutdown. The agreement gives Congress until Oct. 19 to come up
with a new $500 billion, five-year deficit-reduction package.
   At a morning news conference, Bush had said - for the first time
- he could accept higher income taxes on affluent taxpayers ``at
some level'' ifit were coupled with a reduction in capital-gains
taxes. However, Republican leaders warned Bush away from that idea.
   After a late-afternoon meeting between Bush and GOP lawmakers,
Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said, ``We all put up our hands and
said, `no deal on (tax) rates at all.' He (Bush) just acquiesced in
it.''
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of assets such as
houses or corporate stock, currently are taxed at the same rate as
ordinary income. The administration has argued that a lower tax
rate would stimulate the economy; Democrats have countered that
most of the benefits would go to the wealthy.
   Although he declined to discuss details at the news conference,
Bush had clearly indicated he could support a compromise coupling
higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans in exchange for the cut in
capital-gains tax rates that he has long sought.
   ``That's on the table. That's been talked about. And if it's
proper, if it can be worked in proper balance between the capital
gains rate and income tax changes, fine,'' Bush said.
   But later, Republican leaders said they cautioned Bush against
pursuing such a trade, suggesting Democrats would never agree to
drop capital-gains taxe rates low enough to make the bargain
worthwhile.
   ``The president agreed. Our uniform position was that we will
not go up on the (income tax) rates, no matter what,'' said
Packwood, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.
   He said Bush asked the Senate GOP leaders at the meeting if they
would hold fast to such a position. ``And to the man, in the room,
every single person said we will support that,'' Packwood said.
   ``Stop trying to buy us off with capital gains. We're not going
to change that summit agreement,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
at a remark directed at Democrats.
   A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that Bush told the GOP leaders that he did not want
to raise the marginal tax rate - that is, the tax rate on the last
extra dollar of income, sometimes called the ``tax bracket'' - if
he couldn't get a capital gains rate cut at ``an acceptable
level.''
   The marginal rate for the wealthiest Americans is 28 percent.
   ``These guys said, 'you're not going to get it' and he (Bush)
said, 'fine, we don't need either one of them. ... there's nothing
in it for us,''' the official said.
   ``Basically what they told him was you're not going to get the
kind of capital gains (cut) you want. The president said he didn't
want to raise the rates and the conclusion was to forget all of it
- capital gains and the change in the top rate.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, earlier hailed
Bush's seeming turnabout.
   ``I have personally advocated (an increased tax rate) on those
making more than $200,000 a year for some time. And I'm pleased
that the president has now come around, or apparently come around,
to our point of view and to recognize fairness of such a change,''
Mitchell said.
   And aides to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he would ask the panel
to accept the idea.
   Bush promised to do ``everything in my power'' to make sure
Congress comes up with a five-year deficit reduction package that
matches the $500 billion goal of an earlier package supported by
the president and congressional leaders but rejected in the House.
   Bush also apologized to ``the valiant federal work force'' and
others inconvenienced by a three-day government shutdown and
continuing budget uncertainty.
   After vetoing an earlier stopgap spending bill on Saturday, Bush
gave his early morning signature to a new temporary spending bill
that keeps the government operating until Oct. 19 while Congress
tries to come up with the budget accord.
   The president's signature, just hours before the bulk of the
government's 2.4 million work force was to return from a three-day
holiday weekend, averted a widespread disruption in government
services.
   The government's authority to spend money expired at 12:01 a.m.
Saturday. However, the impact of the shutdown was largely confined
to museums, monuments and other federal institutions open on
weekends.
   Bush said he signed the new measure while vetoing the first one
because both chambers subsequently had passed a framework budget
agreement.
   However, Congress now must fill in gaping blanks in the
agreement.
   ``On Saturday morning, I said we cannot have business as usual.
But the Congress has finally acted and we are back on course,''
Bush told a news conference at the White House.
   He told the news conference he was ``open minded'' about
coupling a lower capital-gains tax with ending the current tax-code
anomaly under which some Americans pay a 33 percent marginal income
tax rate while even wealthier ones pay only a 28 percent rate.
   In the past, the administration has never publicly supported
proposals to end this so-called tax ``bubble'' by raising the top
rate to 33 percent.
   A proposal to trade off capital gains and the top tax rate is
currently being advanced by some Democratic leaders, including
House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and Senate
Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   The now-repudiated budget agreement backed by Bush would have
raised excise taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and liquor and certain
luxury items but would not have affected income tax rates.

<HEAD>Youths Set Fires in Lyon for Fourth Night of Disturbances</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 1 graf on where most of immigrants are from.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Youths late Tuesday torched a tobacco shop
and a store in the shopping center of a low-income suburb in the
fourth straight night of unrest, but police said the situation was
under control.
   A group of youths made a protective chain around firemen putting
out the blazes in the shopping complex at Vaulx-en-Velin, a heavily
immigrant community east of Lyon, the police said.
   The situation was far from that of the previous three nights
when hundreds of stone-throwing rioting youths set fire to 20
buildings and burned two dozen cars. Police used tear gas to keep
them at bay.
   The youths protecting firemen told reporters they were seeking
an end to the violence and wanted ``outside troublemakers out.''
   About 700 police were deployed in the community outside Lyon
after rioting started Saturday night, centered in the low-income
complex known as Mas du Taureau.
   The rioting was triggered by the death earlier Saturday of
Thomas Claudio, 21, a passenger on a motorcycle that collided with
a police patrol car.
   Police claim the motorcycle's driver panicked and lost control
of the vehicle when he saw the patrol car. But the driver, Laurent
Assebille, said police caused the accident by stopping their car
suddenly in his path.
   Local officials, along with the youths, blamed police for the
unrest, claiming they routinely harrassed youthful residents with
``humiliating'' identity checks.
   Social Affairs Minister Claude Evin, visiting Vaulx-en-Velin on
Tuesday, met with local officials and called for a dialogue between
youth and police.
   Premier Michel Rocard said the problem stemmed partly from a
lack of communication between different social sectors in France.
   Hubert Prevot, the government official in charge of immigration,
said the ``susceptibility'' of the youth was ``understandable''
even if it was ``not reasonable.''
   In 1981, Lyon's heavily immigrant blue-collar suburbs were the
scene of the worst riots in France in recent times.
   Most of Lyon's immigrants are from southern Europe and North
Africa.

<TEXT>
   The hippest fashion accessory for kids, the
``Slap Wrap'' bracelet, has been banned at two public elementary
schools on the grounds that their sharp edges could cause injury.
   When slapped against the wrist, the low-budget bracelet grabs on
and wraps around to become an instant wristband. It's a flat,
9-inch long steel spring resembling a ruler wrapped in eye-grabbing
neon fabric.
   Principal Joseph Longobardi said Tuesday he was prohibiting his
pupils at Colonial and Siwanoy schools from wearing them during
school hours because if the fabric wears away, a sharp edge can be
exposed and lacerate hands and arms.
   But Gene Murtha, president of Main Street Toy of Simsbury,
Conn., which makes ``The Original Slap Wrap'' and sells it for
$2.49, said his product hasn't caused any injuries. He blamed cheap
imitations made in Taiwan and illegally sold in the United States
for reported injuries.
   ``The metal is inferior, low-grade caliber steel with poor
quality fabric,'' he said. ``The sealing is also inferior. The
steel can either break through or snap through and cause injury.''
   Murtha said his bracelets are made of high-grade steel with
rounded rather than sharp edges and a double-knit fabric that is
tightly sealed.
   He claimed the cheap products were pirated and legal action is
difficult, but cease-and-desist letters against the illegal
products have been issued nationwide and seizures of them by U.S.
Customs have also begun.
   Longobardi, who is principal of two of the four elementary
schools in the Pelham school district, sent a letter to parents
last week advising them of the possible dangers and asked them to
keep the pop toy at home.
   ``I have four kids of my own,'' Longobardi said. ``I know how
popular these things are. ... But the possibility of injury does
exist because of that sharp cutting edge.''
   Longobardi said he decided to ban the toy after hearing of
injuries in the West Orchard Elementary School in nearby Chappaqua.
   Officials there said a pupil who had removed the material
covering required three stitches in her hand after she was cut with
an exposed bracelet edge.
   West Orchard's principal, Dr. Frederick Wilhelm, ordered his
teachers to confiscate any slap bracelets missing the fabric cover,
but did not impose a broad ban.
   Main Street Toy has shipped out nearly 1 million of its
bracelets since the fad started this summer.

   Prosecutors in the obscenity trial
of bawdy rap group 2 Live Crew failed Tuesday to have the judge
dismissed because a defense lawyer was her law professor 15 years
ago.
   Luther Campbell, Chris Wongwon and Mark Ross face misdemeanor
charges stemming from a June 11 adults-only performance at a
nightclub in nearby Hollywood. If convicted, the Miami-based
rappers could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined
$1,000.
   The first two days of the trial have been devoted largely to
motions and and challenges over jury selection.
   Defense attorney Bruce Rogow challenged Broward County's
voter-based jury pool as unconstitutional in cases that depend on
community standards, like obscenity. But Broward County Judge June
Johnson said she wanted to see the whole 70-person pool before
ruling on the defense motion.
   Prosecutors on Monday asked the judge to step down, noting that
Rogow taught her law at nearby Nova University in the mid-1970s.
Johnson refused, saying she lost touch with Rogow after the class.
   Prosecutors appealed the decision before Circuit Judge George
Brescher, but he denied the challenge Tuesday, saying the motion
lacked a required document and was filed too late.
   ``I think what the state has done is try to interfere with this
case getting to trial,'' Rogow said. ``This was utterly frivolous
and I think in bad taste.''
   Rogow also represented Charles Freeman, a black record store
owner convicted of obscenity last week by an all-white jury for
selling the group's album, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   A six-member panel is to be chosen from 70 prospects requested
by the judge. No jurors had been selected by the end of Tuesday's
session, although about 25 had been questioned.
   Jury selection is expected to take several days.
   Only three of 25 potential jurors questioned Monday were black,
and potential jurors interviewed by early Tuesday afternoon
included three blacks. Music by the black group is aimed
principally at a young black audience.
   Jury composition is particularly sensitive because obscenity
cases are decided on the basis of how the panel defines community
standards.
   The album, which U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez earlier ruled
obscene, has sold about 2 million copies.
   Most obscenity cases are argued on the U.S. Supreme Court's
Miller v. California test. Essentially, it holds that material is
obscene if the average person, applying contemporary local
community standards, would find that it is designed to cause sexual
arousal, if it depicts sex in a patently offensive way, and if,
taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   Campbell, the leader of 2 Live Crew, told reporters he was
unhappy with the way jury selection was going. ``I need young
people and black people,'' he said.

   A staff freeze that has prevented the hiring of
a new state embalmer has forced the state to cremate about a dozen
human bodies donated for research.
   Ronald Wade, administrator of the Maryland Anatomy Board, said
the bodies were too deteriorated to be used in studies.
   A hiring freeze Gov. William Donald Schaefer imposed to deal
with a budget crisis has kept Wade from hiring a replacement for
the board's previous embalmer, who suffered a heart attack last
month.
   Wade has run the operation alone while the state considers an
exemption to the hiring freeze.
   The Anatomy Board receives unclaimed and donated bodies and
prepares them for use by medical and dental schools, as well as
hospital training programs. The board receives about 65 corpses a
month and expects almost 800 this year.

   Charges that two former police generals
ordered the murder of a Solidarity priest are the first major
prosecution of Poland's old guard and officially reopen a case most
Poles never considered closed.
   The arrests in the case of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko come six
years after the crime that shocked the nation, and at the outset of
a presidential race in which Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
careful treatment of former Communists is being challenged by Lech
Walesa.
   On Monday, authorities also disclosed that a former interior
minister and six other officials have been accused of taking bribes
of gold and jewelry dating to 1971.
   ``In cases of clear crimes, party people will be punished. If
proven, these people will be condemned,'' Aleksander Smolar, a
senior adviser to Mazowiecki, told an American Society of Newspaper
Editors delegation Tuesday.
   At a Walesa campaign rally in Warsaw on Tuesday, a spectator
challenged the timing of the arrests ``right now before the
elections,'' scheduled for Nov. 25.
   But Smolar said there was absolutely ``no political
calculation'' in the arrests, which he said were ordered by
independent courts.
   He said there would be no departure from the government's basic
policy ``that our evolution to democracy should be as peaceful as
possible, trying to reconcile the two parts of Poland,'' rather
than waging a ``cold civil war'' against former Communists.
   Smolar said he recognized that the prosecutions of former police
officials would prove popular because of ``the feeling of
bitterness and injustice'' after 45 years of communism.
   ``There is a need of a clear moral condemnation, everybody needs
it for a sort of catharsis,'' Smolar said. However, he added, most
Poles understand the wisdom of avoiding purges.
   Those Interior Ministry records that survived destruction - the
Mazowiecki government did not take steps to prevent the burning of
documents - will not be opened to show who cooperated with the
secret police, Smolar said.
   ``It is extremely dangerous and destroys the nation to judge
people for their weaknesses ... in very harsh times, when only
heroes were able to survive with dignity,'' he said.
   The 1984 kidnapping and murder of the 37-year-old Popieluszko,
whose body was pulled from a river, gave a martyr to the
then-underground Solidarity movement the Communists were trying to
crush. Many Polish households still display photographs of the
priest that were put up during the 1980s as a sign of protest.
   Four secret policemen from the Interior Ministry's Fourth
Department, the unit responsible for spying on the Roman Catholic
Church and clergy, were tried and convicted in Popieluszko's death.
Two have been paroled.
   But no involvement was found on the part of higher authorities -
a conclusion that satisfied few and came to symbolize ruthless
communism.
   ``Something unprecedented has happened,'' Jerzy Jachowicz, an
expert on the security services, wrote of the arrests Tuesday in a
front-page Gazeta Wyborcza commentary.
   The two generals, former Deputy Interior Minister Wladyslaw
Ciaston and Zenon Platek, former head of the Fourth Department,
were charged with plotting the priest's slaying during September
and October 1984 and directing the Oct. 19, 1984 killing, officials
said.
   Prosecutors said the corruption charges were unrelated to the
killing. But among those arrested was onetime Interior Minister
Miroslaw Milewski, a former Communist Party Politburo member who
was Central Committee secretary in charge of internal affairs when
Popieluszko was murdered.
   After the slaying, Milewski was quietly dismissed.
   Milewski was given the party posts after being replaced as
interior minister by Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak in 1981, during
Solidarity's first legal period.
   Kiszczak, a Communist holdover in the Solidarity government
until he resigned last summer, told Polish television in September
that he believed the priest's killers could not have acted
``without the inspiration of someone standing higher then them.''
   He suggested the crime was committed by those aiming to
destabilize the ``reform-oriented'' Communist government of
then-party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, now the outgoing
president.
   On Polish television Tuesday, Kiszczak said he believes Ciaston
and Platek, who worked for him, are innocent. He said the
corruption charges against Milewski were investigated in May 1984
and a ``thorough report'' was given to superiors, but he did not
elaborate.
   The Popieluszko case was reopened July 24, three weeks after
Kiszczak's resignation, by the Office for the Protection of the
State, the smaller and tightly controlled agency that replaced the
disbanded secret police.
   The arrests made since Thursday open a ``new chapter in the
case,'' the government daily Rzeczpospolita said.
   ``The direct perpetrators of a crime were already judged. ...
However, unanswered questions still remain,'' the newspaper said.
   The corruption inquiry, which also targets two unidentified
other generals and two colonels, involves acceptance of bribes of
``great value, including many kilograms of gold and jewelry,''
Prosecutor General Aleksander Herzog said.
   The alleged crimes span the period from 1971, when Milewski was
a deputy interior minister, to 1981, Herzog said.

<HEAD>Justices Order Court to Reconsider Libel Suit Against ABC</HEAD>

broadcasts, in 1984 and 1987</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday revived a $4
billion libel suit in which a millionaire inventor says an ABC
television program falsely portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy Arthur
Jones' suit against American Broadcasting Companies over a 1987
report by the ``20-20'' TV program about the fate of 63 baby
elephants Jones rescued from death in Africa.
   The justices said the case should be reconsidered in light of
their ruling last June that the Constitution's guarantee of free
speech did not ``create a wholesale defamation exemption for
anything that might be labeled opinion.''
   The June decision, however, did not strip away constitutional
immunity for pure expressions of opinion that cannot be proved true
or false.
   Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise machines, was the
subject of the ``20-20'' broadcast in 1984 - the year he airlifted
the 63 elephants from Zimbabwe to the Ocala, Fla., farm he calls
Jumbolair.
   The elephants had been marked for death as part of a culling, or
herd thinning, operation.
   The elephants lived on Jones' Ocala estate until the summer of
1986, when the herd began to be dispersed.
   The 1987 report aired by ``20-20'' looked back at the 1984
broadcast and was preceded by a comment by host Barbara Walters
that it would discuss ``the fate o some baby elephants to whom a
promise was not kept.''
   According to Jones' suit, that comment and others contained in
the report ``falsely cast him as a liar and a hypocrite, and
accused him of animal cruelty.''
   Lower courts dismissed the suit, ruling that the sued-over
comment were not defamatory or were expressions of opinion, not
fact.

   The latest in a series of violent land
disputes has left at least one peasant dead and several others
injured, officials said Tuesday.
   Frank Cesar, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said Caroos
Eurarios died Monday in a shootout when police tried to dislodge
peasants from a private farm they had seized near Yasica Sur, 75
miles north of the capital.
   Police Capt. Mario Medina, deputy chief of national police in
the region, said a policeman named Edwin Cisne also died in the
shootout, although Cesar said the death had not yet been confirmed.
   The officials said about 12 police tried to evict 30 peasant
families led by former Contra guerrillas from a private farm.
   Cesar said at least four other people were wounded, but
``information up to this moment is confused and we are
investigating further.''
   About 20,000 Contra rebels were demobilized in June after the
Sandinista government they had opposed was defeated at the polls.
But the end of the civil war has led to a series of local conflicts
involving former rebels of the U.S.-backed group demanding land.
   At least four peasants died and eight were wounded last week
when pro-Sandinista peasants battled with ex-rebels over land in
the northern province of Matagalpa.
   In a similar incident Monday, a group of peasants destroyed a
car owned by farmer Eduardo Callejas when he tried to recover land
confiscated in 1980 by the Sandinistas, who turned it into a
cooperative for 50 families.
   Former rebel chief Israel Galeano said Tuesday over state Radio
Nicaragua that the government should form regional commissions to
solve the problem.
   He said members of the ruling United National Opposition and the
Sandinistas ``are acting irresponsibly to incite peasants from both
sides to take lands.''

   Discussions of higher taxes on the wealthy in
exchange for lower taxes on capital gains have focused on an oddity
in the federal tax code, the so-called ``bubble'' that finds rates
in the top tax bracket lower than in the bracket immediately before
it.
   The marginal tax rate - the tax rate paid on each extra dollar
of income - is different in each tax bracket.
   Currently, single taxpayers face a marginal rate of 15 percent
on adjusted gross income - income after deductions and exemptions -
from zero up to $18,500.
   For incomes between $18,500 and $44,900, the marginal tax rate
is 28 percent, and it is 33 percent between $44,900 and $93,130.
   But it drops back to 28 percent again above $93,130.
   For married taxpayers filing joint returns, the marginal rate is
15 percent up to $30,950, 28 percent from $30,950 to $74,850, 33
percent from $74,850 to $155,320, and 28 percent again above
$155,320.
   The ``bubble'' is not an accident. Congressional tax writers
installed in the 1986 overhaul of federal income taxes to keep the
average tax rate from ever rising above 28 percent, no matter how
large the income.

   A girl has won her court battle to show up
the guy who was a no-show for the high school prom.
   Now all Wendy Collins has to do is collect $150 from David
Schlosser, who she said stood her up for the dance at University
High School.
   Pima County Justice Court Judge Robert Gibson on Friday ordered
Schlosser to reimburse Ms. Collins the $150 she spent for a dress,
shoes and accessories for her would-be date.
   Ms. Collins sued Schlosser in Small Claims Court. He did not
respond to the claim, so the award was automatic.
   The defendant's father, Dr. Harry Schlosser, said his son was on
active duty with the Air Force National Guard when the court
summons arrived by certified mail in June. He said his son, now a
student at the University of Arizona in Tucson, never received
notice of a date for trial or notice for a default date.
   He said his son told him he had heard through school friends
before the prom that Ms. Collins, then a sophomore, did not want to
go to the prom with him after all.
   Ms. Collins phone number is unlisted.

<HEAD>Mexican Attorney General Claims Largest Cocaine Seizure Ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general announced Tuesday that
police had seized more than six tons of Colombian cocaine base, the
largest such confiscation in Mexican history.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said Colombia's
notorious Medellin cocaine cartel was trying to smuggle the drug
through southern Mexico into the United States.
   Alvarez said police learned of a shipment of Colombian drugs in
Guatemala and traced it to the El Retiro ranch, 50 miles northwest
of the Guatemalan border.
   Federal anti-narcotics police fanned out around the ranch at
midnight Friday and advanced on foot through the swampy
surroundings, Alvarez said.
   The drug traffickers spotted the police and in a 90-minute
gunbattle one policeman was injured.
   The officers returned again at daybreak to find the area
abandoned, but discovered several guns and 172 half-buried bags and
three metal drums of cocaine base.
   Alvarez said the haul totaled 12,760 pounds of 96 percent pure
cocaine base. He described the bust as ``the largest in the history
of our country.''
   ``It has been possible to determine that this drug is the
property of the Medellin Cartel,'' the attorney general said.
   ``At this time, one person has been detained for investigation
and it is hoped that soon the participants will be detected and
detained.''
   Alvarez said police found blood stains at the ranch, indicating
somebody had been injured in the shootout.

   Air Canada will lay off 2,900 of its 3,000
employees and cut routes to Europe and the Far East because of
rising fuel costs and the recession, the airline announced Tuesday.
   Customer service workers - which include baggage handlers,
mechanics and ramp workers - will be hardest hit, losing about
1,390 people across Canada.
   The Montreal-based carrier also said cuts will include 220
pilots, 440 flight attendants, 425 ticket agents, 265 members of
the management and clerical staff, and various personnel from other
departments.
   Earlier Tuesday, union officials estimated 2,800 workers would
be laid off. Most of the cuts would be made by Jan. 31, said Claude
Taylor, Air Canada chairman. The layoffs in management would likely
be completed by mid-1991.
   ``The passenger market is well down this year and fuel costs are
driving us to raise our prices,'' he said.
   Canada, with 25 million residents, has been hit in recent months
by rising interest rates as well as increased costs for fuel in the
aftermath of the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2 of Kuwait.

   Zambia's state anti-corruption commission
said Tuesday it raided three illegal ivory workshops, breaking a
link in a smuggling chain.
   Two owners of the Zairean-run workshops in Lusaka were arrested,
said Paul Russell, the commission operation's director. The third
owner escaped.
   Russell said police seized meat carvers and electric sanders
used to cut elephant tusks into small pieces for smuggling out of
the country.
   The workshops, believed to employ people mainly from neighboring
Zaire, were the first such hideouts found in Zambia, Russell said.
   Also Tuesday, the commission arrested two police officers and a
hotel employee for transporting poached elephant tusks in police
and civilian vehicles.
   Zimbabwe has frequently accused senior figures in Zambian
political and business life of funding cross-border poaching forays
for valuable rhino horn and ivory.
   Zambia's own rhino and elephant herds have been decimated by
poaching and lax conservation policies in the past decade.
   Early this year, Zambia formed a group of paramilitary rangers
to combat illegal hunters and investigate poaching networks.
   In August, the armed game rangers seized the tusks of 63
elephants found in a poachers' hideout in a nature reserve 361
miles south of Lusaka.
   Western diplomats in Lusaka have said the ivory is smuggled to
South Africa and Swaziland before going on to Hong Kong.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A much-coveted trophy for the fastest crossing of
the Atlantic by a passenger vessel arrived Tuesday from the United
States after an American company decided to drop its challenge to
the record.
   Three months ago, a ``SeaCat'' catamaran built and owned by the
British company, Hoverspeed Ltd., set a record of 3 days, 7 hours
and 54 minutes for the 2,740-mile crossing from Cape Cod, Mass., to
Bishop's Rock.
   The crossing by the Hoverspeed Great Britain beat the previous
record by 2{ hours.
   The previous record holders, U.S. Lines Inc., questioned the new
record and objected to the revolutionary design of the British
craft. For a while, it seemed the dispute would be taken to court.
   ``We got the best legal advice and the conditions of the trust
are quite clear,'' said Commander Michael Ranker, secretary of the
trustees for the Blue Riband award.
   ``In the end I think the Americans decided they did not have a
leg to stand on and could not afford protracted litigation,'' he
said.
   The U.S. company released the trophy on Thursday and it arrived
at Heathrow Airport early Tuesday.
   The award, represented by the Hales Trophy since 1935, has not
been held by the British for 38 years. It will be presented by the
Blue Riband trustees to the SeaCat owners in a few weeks.
   The Hales Trophy was last won by the SS United States of the
U.S. Lines Inc. in 1952. It had recently been on exhibit in a Long
Island, N.Y., museum.
   The onyx and silver trophy, presented in 1935 by Harold Hales, a
member of Parliament, stands near 4 feet high and is worth about
$475,000.

   A psychiatrist testified Tuesday that
the motherly bond should be paramount in a custody battle over an
infant that a surrogate mother agreed to carry for a childless
couple for $10,000.
   A judge was to continue hearing testimony Wednesday about who
should get custody of the three-week-old boy.
   Mark and Crispina Calvert, who hired Anna Johnson to bear their
baby and supplied the sperm and egg, have temporary custody. Ms.
Johnson claims they neglected her, and the couple contends she
wanted more money.
   Attorneys in the case say it is unique because the surrogate has
no genetic link to the baby she wants to keep. In the
much-publicized Baby M case in New Jersey, the surrogate mother was
also the baby's genetic mother.
   One witness called by Ms. Johnson's lawyers was David
Chamberlain, a California psychologist and vice president of the
Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology Association of America. He wrote
``Babies Remember Birth.''
   Chamberlain testified about his hypnosis experiments that show
children can remember their birth and have memories of experiences
in the womb.
   The relationship between a birth mother and a child is extremely
close, Chamberlain said. ``Nothing could be closer than a baby in
utero and a birth mother,'' Chamberlain said.
   Psychiatrist Michelle Harrison, a teacher at the University of
Pittsburgh and a consultant to the National Coalition Against
Surrogacy, said she counseled Johnson by telephone five or six
times during her pregnancy.
   ``The natural mother is the woman who gives birth to the child
and that includes whether or not the child is of her genetic
origins,'' she testified in Orange County Superior Court.
   She said Ms. Johnson feared losing the baby but seemed to cling
to the idea that society would recognize the child as hers.
   Ms. Johnson has been granted twice-weekly visits with the baby.
The psychiatrist said Ms. Johnson believes the child recognizes her
by smell, feels safe with her and attempts to nurse.
   However, she also said she has never seen the baby with either
the surrogate mother or the Calverts and couldn't judge either
side's attachment to the child.
   Christian Van Deusen, the Calverts' attorney, asked Ms. Harrison
about a letter Ms. Johnson wrote to the couple during her
pregnancy.
   The letter read in part: ``I am asking you for help in paying
off the final $5,000. Once this baby is born my hands are free of
this deal, but see, this situation can go two ways. One, you can
pay me the whole sum early so I don't have to live in the streets.
Or two, you can forget about helping me out, calling it a breach of
contract, and not get the baby.''
   Ms. Harrison said the letter didn't affect her opinion of Ms.
Johnson's concern for the baby. She said pregnant women under
stress ``say and do a lot of things to keep the baby.''
   Harold LaFlamme, the baby's court-appointed attorney, questioned
the psychiatrist about the propriety of counseling by phone. She
said she believed it was appropriate because of the unusual
circumstances.
   Ms. Johnson, who worked with Mrs. Calvert at a hospital in this
Southern California city, was hired by the couple to bear their
child because a hysterectomy prevents Mrs. Calvert from carrying a
baby.

   Flags flew at half-staff across Alabama on Tuesday in honor of
two Alabama Air National Guardsmen who died in the crash of their
jet during Persian Gulf operations.
   In New Hampshire, the father of a Marine pilot missing after a
helicopter crash in the Arabian Sea said his son had written a
letter saying he didn't mind being in the world's hot spot because
that's why he was in the military.
   Alabama Guard officials said the bodies of Maj. Barry K.
Henderson, 40, a senior pilot from Tuscumbia, and Maj. Stephen G.
Schramm, 43, a master navigator from Birmingham, were being flown
home from the Persian Gulf region this week.
   They were among 111 members of the 117th wing who volunteered
for duty in the Persian Gulf, leaving for assignments in Operation
Desert Shield on Aug. 24.
   Henderson's father, Joe, said ``I had to accept it when he left.
I told him, `Son, you're going to where it's beyond my control. All
I can do is put you in the hands of the Lord.' ''
   Henderson often teamed up with David Elliott, another Alabama
Guard pilot, but Elliott apparently was sick at the time of the
flight, said his sister, Sharon Melson.
   ``I know they don't know the cause of the crash,'' said the
father. ``But David and Barry could almost tell what the other one
was thinking, they had flown so much together ... If they could
have been together it (crash) might not have happened.''
   Schramm is survived by his wife, Cynthia, and two children.
   Henderson, who turned 40 on Saturday, is survived by his wife,
Myra, and two sons.
   In New Hampshire, Glen Dillon said of his son, Gary: ``He's a
Marine through and through. He felt if that's where we needed to
go, that's where he needed to be. That's what he was in the service
for.''
   Capt. Gary Dillon, 29, has been missing since Monday when two
helicopters disappeared over the Arabian Sea during training
flights.
   The elder Dillon said Tuesday the Marines told him they didn't
expect to find survivors.
   ``He had written and said it was kind of quiet,'' Dillon said.
``He was just waiting for what ever orders came through and flying
a lot of training missions.''
   He said his son was engaged to be married.
   The other seven men missing on the two helicopters were
identified by the Marine Corps on Tuesday as: Capt. William D.
Cronin Jr., 29, of Du Page County, Ill.; Capt. Kevin R. Dolvin, 29,
Stark County, Ohio; Capt. William J. Hurley, 27, Cook County, Ill.;
Sgt. Kenneth T. Keller, 26, Cook County, Ill.; Sgt. John R. Kilkus,
26, Norfolk County, Mass.; Cpl. Timothy W. Romei, 22, San Francisco
County, Calif.; and Lance Cpl. Thomas R. Adams, 20, Baton Rouge
Parish, La.
   The Corps did not release the men's hometowns or other
information.
   All eight were part of a search-and-rescue squadron based at
Camp Pendleton, Calif.

   Saddam Hussein announced Tuesday that Iraq had added another
missile to its arsenal, and he said it could be launched ``against
the targets of evil when the day of reckoning comes.''
   The Iraqi leader made it clear he was referring to Israel and
the U.S.-led forces massed in Saudi Arabia to deter further Iraqi
aggression following the invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq has other missiles that can travel hundreds of miles and it
was not clear what the significance of a new one would be.
   Saddam appeared to use the occasion to try to exploit the deaths
Monday of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem to whip up support for his
seizure of Kuwait.
   U.S. armed forces radio took to the airwaves Tuesday with live
broadcasts, and rock 'n' roll blared across the Saudi desert.
   The first song on Desert Shield Network FM 107 brought the
troops a little closer to home - The Clash's ``Rock The Casbah''
about a fight over ``boogie sound'' in a traditional Middle Eastern
city.
   The Pentagon said the Navy continued to search for eight Marines
whose two helicopters disappeared Monday over the North Arabian Sea
during a training exercise. Rescue teams located debris from one of
the aircraft on Monday, but no bodies.
   The Marines released the names of the missing servicemen
Tuesday, but Marines spokeswoman Maj. Nancy LaLunta in Washington
declined to say whether the men are presumed dead.
   The missing men were identified as: Capt. Gary S. Dillon; Capt.
William D. Cronin Jr.; Capt. Kevin R. Dolvin; Capt. William J.
Hurley; Sgt. Kenneth T. Keller; Sgt. John R. Kilkus; Cpl. Timothy
W. Romei; and Lance Cpl. Thomas R. Adams.
   The Marine Corps did not release the men's ages, hometowns or
other information. All were part of a search-and-rescue squadron
based at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   In other developments:
   -A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad said that a U.S.-chartered
Iraqi jetliner will evacuate about 350 more Americans Wednesday.
   Most passengers will be transported from Kuwait to the airport
in the Iraqi city of Basra, said the State Department, which
estimated 400 Americans and foreign-born family members will be on
the flight. The plane is due to arrive in Raleigh-Durham airport in
North Carolina on Thursday after an overnight stop in London.
   -Crude oil prices reached an all-time high of $40.40 a barrel
Tuesday. The futures price last topped $40 after the 1979 Iranian
Revolution. In reaction, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
tumbled 78.22 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at 2,445.54. It was
the Dow average's 11th worst point drop, after the fall of 86.61
points on Sept. 11, 1986.
   -Japan's governing party was to present a proposal to a special
session of Parliament Friday that would allow military forces to
help with U.N. peacekeeping efforts in the Persian Gulf and to be
armed in case they were attacked, a party source said.
   The proposal would allow Japanese forces to be sent overseas for
the first time since World War II. Force overseas is barred by the
country's constitution, and Japan has been criticized for not doing
enough in the current crisis.
   -A spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev expressed
optimism over a settlement to the gulf crisis following a meeting
Friday between Saddam and a Soviet envoy.
   Vitaly Ignatenko would not give details but said Gorbachev would
nform President Bush by letter of the latest Soviet diplomacy.
   The gulf crisis began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Since
then, Saddam has linked withdrawal from Kuwait with an Israeli
pullout from Arab territories captured in 1967.
   Saddam made his announcement about the new Iraqi missile in a
statement read by an announcer on Baghdad Radio.
   The new missile is called the al-Hijara, or Stone, apparently in
honor of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories who throw
stones at soldiers. Palestinians are among Sadddam's staunchest
supporters.
   Monday's bloodshed in Jerusalem occurred when police opened fire
on Palestinians who hurled stones at Jews worshiping at the Western
Wall. The wall is just below the Temple Mount, which is sacred to
both Jews and Moslems, and there had been rumors that Jewush
zealots were planning to march on the mount.
   Addressing Israel, Saddam said: ``The faithful Palestinians
faced up to you ... with stones which no power on earth can
withhold from those who wish to use them.
   ``They are the Stones of the new missile, which the Iraqis have
invented with the help of almighty God and which can be launched
from somewhere in the land of Iraq to reach the targets of evil
when the day of reckoning comes,'' Saddam said.
   He again demanded that Israel withdraw from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and that the United States remove its troops
from the region.
   ``There is no way out for you except to leave the land of
Palestine and the sanctities of the Arabs, just as there is no way
out for the armies of America and its allies except to leave the
holy land of the Arabs and Moslems,'' Saddam said.
   ``There is room only for this, otherwise you will get what you
will get.''
   The statement gave no details on how many of the reported
missiles Iraq has, whether they have been deployed or what kind of
warhead they can carry.
   It was not possible to obtain independent verification of
Saddam's claim.
   But Don Kerr, a weapons analyst at London's International
Institute for Strategic Studies, said the claim would not be
outlandish.
   ``Iraq has had considerable success with surface-to-surface
missiles, mostly derivatives of the Soviet-made Scud,'' Kerr said
in a telephone interview.
   Iraq's al-Hussein missile has a range of 310 to 370 miles and
the al-Abbas missile a range of 500 to 560 miles, he said.
   Last December, Iraq test-fired its Tammuz missile, a three-stage
rocket ostensibly designed to lift satellites into lower orbit,
Kerr noted.
   ``The thing to remember about a firework that will put a
satellite into orbit is that will send a warhead much farther than
a few hundred (miles) on the flat,'' he said.
   But Iraq's missile guidance systems are questionable, Kerr said,
and ``those used have not been too impressive.''

<HEAD>Report Says Hostage-Linked Prisoners Now on the Run in Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kuwaiti lawyer who fled to Bahrain said
Tuesday that a few of the 15 pro-Iranian terrorists whose release
was a key demand of Lebanese hostage-takers now are hunted men
inside Kuwait.
   The lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of
family in Kuwait, said some of the 11 Iaqis, three Lebanese and
one Kuwaiti escaped to Iran and Lebanon but others remained in
Kuwait.
   All 15 were Shiite Moslems and most belonged to Iraq's al-Dawa
group, seeking to topple Saddam Hussein. They were convicted in the
1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait.
   The Islamic Jihad organization in Lebanon repeatedly demanded
release of their fellow Shiites from prison in Kuwait as a
condition for freeing Western hostages.
   ``They are no different from the Americans now,'' the lawyer
said of the former prisoners still in Kuwait. ``They are hiding
from the Iraqis. If they catch them, they will consider them prize
hostages to trade with the Americans.
   ``I saw two or three in Kuwait, met them in mosques, or at
various houses.''
   He said those with Iranian or Lebanese connections ``fled as
soon as they could'' after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
   Shortly after the invasion, Kuwaiti prison guards fled and ``the
Iraqis opened the doors to the jails, wanting chaos,'' the lawyer
said.
   He said the escapees were ``not gloating'' about what happened
to Kuwait.
   ``They entered jail because of Saddam Hussein,'' he went on.
``They repeatedly say they have nothing against Kuwait, that their
bombing raids were meant to alert Kuwait that it was wrong to
support him, wrong to make enemies with Iran against Iraq, and
history has proved us right.''
   Seventeen men were jailed in the bombings. Two were released
last year after completing five-year sentences.
   The lawyer was among the latest group of Kuwaitis to make it
through the Saudi border at Khafji that reopened over the weekend.
   He estimated about 100,000 Kuwaitis remained in what Iraq now
calls its 19th province. That was far lower than other estimates of
300,000.
   ``Some want to die there. . . . There is no food, no medicine,
no antibiotics any more.''
   He said there were ``Iraqi soldiers at all intersections . . .
checking cars and identity.'' He said there was ``haphazard
searching of houses. They search for arms used by the resistance,
pictures of the emir, and the Americans and Westerners that
Kuwaitis hide.''
   ``It's getting worse and worse . . . please help,'' he said.
   Kuwait contained about 1.9 million people before the invasion,
about 60 percent of them non-Kuwaitis. Many foreigners fled.
   The lawyer said Kuwaiti resistance fighters were trying to
expand operations to outlying areas and to Iraq itself, but ``a
bullet from a house means the whole area is burned down by the
Iraqis.''
   He said one Kuwaiti officer used as a bodyguard for visiting
dignitaries was suspected of resistance and was killed after being
tortured, his mutilated body thrown in front of his house.

   A University of Florida freshman listed
as a suspect in the slayings of five students confessed to
battering his grandmother and asked repeatedly ``Why did I do
it?,'' an ambulance driver testified Tuesday.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey, jailed on a $1 million bond, is charged
with aggravated battery in the Aug. 30 assault on Elna Hlavaty at
her Indialantic home.
   The alleged assault occurred the weekend after four women
students and one male student were stabbed to death in their
off-campus apartments in Gainesville. Three of the women were
mutilated and one was decapitated, authorities said.
   No one has been charged in the killings, and Humphrey has been
listed as one of several suspects.
   In the assault case, prosecutors suffered a setback when the
judge refused to allow them to introduce as evidence police
accounts of statements the grandmother allegedly made the night she
was battered at her home.
   Mrs. Hlavaty has said she can't remember what happened, and
doesn't believe her grandson attacked her.
   Prosecutor Philip Williams, saying Mrs. Hlavaty was trying to
protect her grandson, sought to introduce her statements. But
Brevard Circuit Judge Theron A. Yawn rejected the testimony, saying
the hearsay account of her statements shouldn't be used since Mrs.
Hlavaty was available as a witness.
   Ambulance driver Cliff Cooper, who took Mrs. Hlavaty to the
hospital, testified that he heard Humphrey repeatedly say, ``Why
did I do it?''
   Brevard County Deputy Sheriff Doug Hammack, who also answered an
emergency 911 call to her home, testified that he heard Humphrey
say, ``I hit her and I'm sorry. I'm going to kill myself.''
   The prosecution rested its case Tuesday; the defense planned to
call more witnesses Wednesday.
   Public Defender J.R. Russo said the state had failed to link
Humphrey to the actual injuries inflicted on his grandmother and
failed to prove she suffered a permanent injury or that there was
great bodily harm.
   ``Without a doubt, none of those factors have been proved by the
state,'' Russo said, adding that they are required for conviction
on aggravated battery charges.
   Before the ruling, Hammack told the judge with the jury outside
the courtroom that when he found Mrs. Hlavaty, her hair was matted
with blood, she was holding a bowl of ice on her face and her right
eye was swollen shut.
   ```He hit me. I can't believe he did this to me,''' the officer
quoted her as saying. When asked who did it, she replied,
``Edward.''
   Dr. Jeri Fitts, the first witness in the trial, said he examined
Mrs. Hlavaty in the hospital. He said she suffered a broken facial
bone under her eye and a possible broken jaw, along with numerous
contusions.
   He denied the injuries could have been caused by a fall, as she
later said, testifying it would have taken three or four blows to
cause that much damage.
   Later, in defense testimony, two ophthalmologists who examined
Mrs. Hlavaty and a radiologist who looked at two sets of X-rays
said they found no evidence of the fracture below her eyeball.
   If convicted of aggravated battery on a person over the age of
65, Humphrey would be sentenced to at least three years in prison
without parole. He also faces unrelated charges of attempted rape
in Indian River County and assault in Alachua County.

<HEAD>Students Commit Suicide to Protest Job Quota Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least six students died across India
on Tuesday to protest a job quota plan that reserves half of the
government's vacancies for low-caste Hindus, news reports said.
   Press Trust of India said the students either took poison,
hanged or immolated themselves in the states of Punjab, Himachal
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
   In New Delhi, a student set himself ablaze and died. But another
student, a 14-year-old girl, said she was set on fire by two other
students.
   Parveen Kaur said before dying that she was forcibly set ablaze
by two boys of an adjoining school. The state-run television quoted
a senior police official as saying it was case of murder and not
suicide.
   The deaths brought the total number of people killed in the job
quota protest violence to at least 97 since Prime Minister V.P.
Singh announced the plan on Aug. 7.
   Students from higher castes, angered by a government refusal to
review the plan, forced strikes in the states of Rajasthan and
Himachal Pradesh, the state-owned television reported.
   Public opposition to the plan has been widespread in the
politically influential cities of northern India. The army has been
called out and curfews clamped on several towns to control rioting
students, joined sometimes by housewives and government employees.
   Two members of Singh's governing party have resigned from
Parliament and some colleagues demanded his ouster because of the
quotas. Singh has refused to abandon the policy, saying it is an
affirmative action program that would give social justice to the
lower castes.
   Critics say he fears alienating the lower castes, which form a
majority of the eligible votes among India's 880 million people.
   Upper-caste students say reverse discrimination will deprive
them of government jobs for which they believe themselves to be
better qualified.
   The plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for low-caste
Hindus. An additional 22 percent already are set aside for the
lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of Indian society,
tribespeople and the so-called untouchables.

   Soldiers killed a suspected
veteran IRA terrorist and a former official of the IRA's political
wing Tuesday at a shootout southwest of Belfast, police reported.
   Desmond Grew, 37, and Martin McCaughey, 23, died in a pre-dawn
ambush at a farm outside Loughgall. The shooting occurred just
after the pair arrived with two men and a woman, said the Royal
Ulster Constabulary.
   The unidentified men and the woman were not hurt and were
arrested at the scene. Three rifles were seized in the incident, 30
miles southwest of Belfast, police said.
   Grew was believed ``to have been involved in acts of kidnapping,
murder, attempted murder, bombing attacks, shootings and armed
robberies'' since the 1970s, said police.
   Police in other countries also were investigating Grew's
activities in connection with terrorist incidents, police said.
   The domestic news agency Press Association said German police
wanted him for questioning about terrorist incidents, including the
killing in October 1989 of a Royal Air Force corporal and his
6-month-old daughter in Wildenrath.
   In 1976 he was sentenced to six years in a Belfast jail for
kidnapping, possession of explosives and other charges, and spent
eight years in jail in Ireland for armed robbery from 1980-88,
police said.
   Grew's brother, Seamus Grew, was shot by the Royal Ulster
Constabulary in 1982. He had been a member of the outlawed Irish
National Liberation Army. Another brother, Adrian Grew, is serving
a 14-year sentence for attempting to blow up an army patrol.
   McCaughey, former councilor for the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, was also believed to belong to the IRA and to have been
involved in terrorist activity, said police.
   Security in County Armagh had been increased the last few weeks
following a rise in the number of attacks on off-duty police and
soldiers.
   The attacks were blamed on the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
which is fighting to oust the British from the Protestant-dominated
province of Northern Ireland.
   In May 1987, eight IRA members were shot to death by elite
British troops as they launched a bomb attack on the Loughgall
police station. A ninth man unconnected with the attack died when
he was caught in crossfire.
   Last month, the same police station was demolished in an IRA
bombing. The building was empty at the time.

<HEAD>Africa Watch Calls for Pressure on Malawi Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Malawi is suppressing dissent by
detaining, torturing and murdering political opponents, a human
rights organization said Wednesday.
   Africa Watch urged the West to cut aid to president-for-life
Kamuzu Banda's government, which it likened to ``regimes such as
the late Nicolae Ceausescu's in Romania and Kim il-Sung's in North
Korea.''
   The U.S. government has criticized the detention of Malawian
poet Jack Mapanje, but also has substantially increased military
assistance to the southern African country the past two years,
Africa Watch said.
   Britain has a stated policy of linking aid to Africa with human
rights, ``but it has apparently not made such a connection in the
case of Malawi,'' the group said.
   Malawi, a former British protectorate, gained independence in
1964. Banda took office in July 1966 and became life president five
years later.
   In a 116-page report to be published Wednesday, Africa Watch
said there is ``a totalitarian suppression of all independent
expression with a high degree of personal despotism by the
life-president and his `official hostess,' Cecilia Tamanda
Kadzamira.''
   The report says Malawian police in March fatally shot more than
20 protesters in Kawale, a suburb of the capital city of Lilongwe.
   Other ``political murders'' included the death of journalist and
human rights monitor Mkwapatira Mhango, who died in a firebomb
attack in Lusaka, Zambia, in October 1989, along with his family,
Africa Watch reported.
   ``Only weeks earlier he had been publicly denounced by Banda,''
the report said.
   Africa Watch said it gathered testimony showing that three
cabinet ministers and a legislator who died mysteriously in 1983
were murdered while in official custody.
   The four favored electoral and decision-making reform, Africa
Watch said. The government said they died in a car accident.
   The report said detention without trial is also ``an important
weapon against dissent.''
   ``Presidential detention powers are arbitrary, with no
possibility of administrative or judicial review,'' the report
said.
   Africa Watch also accused the government of discriminating
against people living in the northern region of the nation of about
7.1 million residents. Banda and his associates are from the
central region.
   Africa Watch said political prisoners are reported to have been
severely beaten.
   ``But the worst treatment is reserved for persistent criminal
offenders,'' it said.
   ``According to testimony, these prisoners ... are stripped
naked, chained to the floor of their cells and either denied food
or given one-quarter rations. Many are reported to have died.''
   Africa Watch has been denied access to the prisons.
   Africa Watch is part of Human Rights Watch, an nonprofit
organization with regional divisions monitoring Asia, the Americas
and Africa.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Adopts Limits on Nuclear Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature on Tuesday followed the
lead of the U.S. Senate by unanimously adopting limits on nuclear
weapons testing embodied in two treaties from the 1970s.
   The Supreme Soviet went beyond the Senate, appealing to
parliaments around the world to ban nuclear testing and repeating
the Kremlin proposal for ``global nuclear disarmament.''
   The significance of the treaties has waned since the 1970s.
Today, the superpowers are preparing to seal one pact to cut their
nuclear arsenals and another to scale back conventional forces in
Europe.
   Additionally, environmental protests might force the Soviets to
unilaterally suspend nuclear testing. On Monday, KGB border guards
boarded a Greenpeace vessel in the arctic after it dispatched
environmentalists to go ashore to a nuclear test site.
   Earlier this year, public pressure forced the Soviet government
to suspend testing at its main site, Semipalatinsk, in Kazakhstan.
   Maj. Gen. Anatoly Koltunov, a member of the parliament of the
Russian Federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics,
demanded Tuesday that authorities investigate plans to test nuclear
devices at Novaya Zemlya, the independent news agency Interfax
reported.
   In the Kremlin on Tuesday, Soviet lawmakers voted 347-0, with
nine abstentions, to approve the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty,
which limits weapons tests to 150 kilotons, and the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which places the same limits on
explosions for engineering purposes.
   Adoption of the treaties was slowed because former President
Carter wanted a more sweeping ban on testing, and his successor,
former President Reagan, did not believe the technology existed to
verify compliance.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cleared
the way for ratification at their last summit by agreeing to a new
set of verification rules.
   Supporters say the new verification measures are likely to set
important precedents for further reducing or banning nuclear tests.
   In approving the treaties, the Soviet parliament asked its
international and national security committees to review questions
stemming from four reservations that the Senate attached to the
pacts.
   A U.S. Senate aide, contacted in Washington, said ``none of the
reservations was serious enough for the Soviets to really care
about.''
   One of the reservations authorized the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff to make plans to test above the 150-kiloton limit if the
Soviets break the treaty, said the Senate aide, who spoke on
condition he not be further identified.
   The second urges the United States to begin negotiations
immediately to lower the ceiling. The third commits the
administration not to change its interpretation of the treaties,
and the fourth requires the government to notify the Senate if the
means of verification change.
   The treaties focus mainly on verification methods, and allow
each country to maintain on-site monitoring equipment at three
sites on each other's soil.

   John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was
delivered Tuesday as his song ``Imagine'' was played simultaneously
for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have
been his 50th birthday.
   ``A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream
together is reality. Happy birthday, John. The world is better
today for sharing a time with you,'' Yoko Ono said at a United
Nations ceremony before the playing of ``Imagine.''
   The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a
taped message that served as an introduction to the music.
   ``We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. ... Think of
your children. Do you want them to be killed or don't you? And
that's the choice we have in front of us. War or peace,'' said
Lennon, whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday.
   None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations, but a
tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner, Paul McCartney,
who released a live version of the Beatles' tune ``Birthday.'' The
song, originally on the ``White Album,'' was the first
Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in
1969.
   ``The release date and John's birthday is just a happy
coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate,'' said
McCartney, 47.
   Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to Los
Angeles.
   In Lennon's hometown in England, fans gathered at the former
site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were discovered.
   Among those attending was Lennon's 71-year-old uncle, Charlie
Lennon.
   When asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies,
he said: ``If he had been alive I doubt he would have come and even
if he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh.''
   On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1
billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near
Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the ``Imagine''
broadcast:
   ``Imagine all the people, living life in peace
   ``You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
   ``I hope some day you'll join us
   ``And the world will live as one.''
   ``His spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have been
touched with him,'' Ono said of her late husband.
   ``I would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as a
day of love, because he was a man of love, and because love is much
needed at this time in our lives.''
   Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N.
secretary-general. During her brief remarks, Ono also quoted a line
from another of Lennon's songs, ``Happy Xmas (War is Over)'':
``Remember, war is over if you want it.''
   More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries
broadcast the 10-minute event. U.S. Armed Forces television and
radio beamed it to 80-plus other countries. MTV televised the
``Imagine'' video in 25 countries, said Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman
for the network.
   In Moscow, about 1,000 Soviets gathered at the Moscow Electrical
Lamp Factory's cultural hall to listen to Lennon's music, snap up
his albums and posters and reflect on his life.
   Even the staid state television program ``Vremya'' got into the
act. An anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash,
described ``Imagine'' as an ``anthem of peace.'' The broadcast
ended with an instrumental version of ``Yesterday.''
   Not so long ago, the Beatles' music was banned in the Soviet
Union. In 1964, one commentator warned that ``these bugs can
swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.''
   Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his Manhattan
apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980.

<HEAD>Cambodian Guerrilla Leader Asks for Help to Reopen Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cambodian guerrilla leader has asked
France and Indonesia to intervene to help reopen peace talks
between the guerrillas and the Vietnamese-installed government in
Phnom Penh.
   A guerrilla radio broadcast said Son Sann suggested France and
Indonesia help break the stalemate over Cambodia's Supreme National
Council, a national reconciliation body, by participating in its
next meeting.
   He said the Cambodians could resolve their dispute by asking the
two nations, which co-chaired the international conference on
Cambodia in August 1989, to interpret the documents of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and of the
Cambodians in talks in Indonesia.
   A transcript of the Sunday broadcast was seen Tuesday in
Bangkok.
   Son Sann heads the Khmer People's National Liberation Front,
which is allied in a resistance coalition with the Khmer Rouge and
the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in fighting the government
Vietnam installed after a late 1978 invasion.
   The Supreme National Council is supposed to send a joint
delegation to the United Nations, arrange the first truce in the
war, and eventually guide the nation to democracy through new
elections.
   But its first meeting, in Bangkok on Sept. 17, collapsed in
squabbling over opposition demands that Sihanouk, a former head of
state and the coalition leader, join the council as its chairman.
   The guerrillas have rejected the government's demand that if
Sihanouk became chairman, the government side should have the vice
chairmanship.
   A Security Council plan adopted in August said that, ``should
Prince Norodom Sihanouk be elected by the SNC as its president, the
Five would welcome this decision.''
   The five permanent members of the Security Council are Britain,
China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States.
   The joint communique in Indonesia, where the Supreme National
Council was formed on Sept. 10 with six government members and six
guerrilla members, said that ``if the 12 members of the SNC so
desire,'' they could elect a chairman who would be the 13th member.
   The problem was largely due to Sihanouk's failure to attend the
Indonesia talks. He stayed at his Beijing home, saying he was ill.

<HEAD>Report: Marcos Moved Funds Through Actor George Hamilton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor George Hamilton was a conduit for $12
million taken out of the Philippines by former President Ferdinand
Marcos and his wife Imelda, a newspaper reported.
   Court records obtained by the Los Angeles Times indicate the
actor used some of the money to finance the mortgage on a Beverly
Hills mansion and to launch a film development project.
   In a previously sealed deposition, Hamilton testified that he
received money from associates of the Marcoses but didn't know it
was linked to the couple, the Times reported Tuesday. Hamilton said
he paid the money back.
   ``Maybe he was a tool for someone, an innocent,'' said Arthur N.
Greenberg, Hamilton's attorney. ``He would not knowingly
participate in any transaction that has any taint.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles G. LaBella, a New York
prosecutor, said the Marcoses used Hamilton as ``a front'' to move
money out of the impoverished country. No investigation of Hamilton
is planned, he said.
   The deposition - a sworn statement made under questioning by
lawyers outside of court - is on file in one of many civil lawsuits
filed in California against Imelda Marcos by the Philippine
government.
   The lawsuits accuse Mrs. Marcos of converting billions of
dollars in government funds into private wealth during her
husband's 20-year rule. She was acquitted in July of fraud and
federal racketeering charges in a New York criminal case in which
Hamilton was an unindicted co-conspirator.
   Marcos died last year in exile in Hawaii.
   Hamilton, 51, has acknowledged publicly that he received many
gifts from Mrs. Marcos, whom he has known for about 10 years. He
also acted as a financial adviser to her, the Times said.
   He and Mrs. Marcos have denied rumors linking them romantically.
   Hamilton is known for his portrayal of a vampire in the movie,
``Love at First Bite.''
   Court documents show that $12 million flowed from secret Marcos
bank accounts in the Philippines through Hamilton investments in
the United States to other banks and offshore shell companies
associated with the Marcoses.
   The Times said Hamilton received $5.5 million from a Marcos
associate to invest in a film project but returned the money to a
Hong Kong bank in 1983 after deciding against making the movie.
   Hamilton also received a $6 million loan - $4 million of which
was secured by his Los Angeles-area estate - from Antonio O.
Floirendo, a Marcos confidante, the documents show.
   In 1986, the house was sold to an offshore corporation
controlled by Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, who was indicted
along with Mrs. Marcos and also acquitted.
   The newspaper said the property will soon be turned over to the
Philippine government, which contends it was financed with looted
money.

<HEAD>Amnesty Details Killings, Torture In India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International urged India on Wednesday to
curb abuses of special anti-insurrection powers that give security
forces broad authority to shoot and make arrests.
   The statement by the human rights group accompanied a 73-page
report detailing arbitrary arrests and torture of hundreds of
people in and around Oinam village in northeast Manipur state in
1987.
   ``Soldiers appear to believe they can beat, kill and torture
young or old without fear of punishment. The government must send a
clear message that this will not be tolerated,'' said the group,
which has headquarters in London.
   Indian security forces were granted similar powers earlier this
year in Kashmir, where Moslem militants are demanding an
independent state, it said. More than 250 people have been killed
in Jammu-Kashmir state since a government crackdown began in
January.
   The report quotes witnesses as saying villagers in Manipur were
beaten, given electric shocks, burned with cigarettes or hung
upside down by troops of the Assam Rifles unit.
   Amnesty said the abuses came during a counterinsurgency campaign
launched after secessionists based in Nagaland state attacked an
Assam Rifles' outpost and killed nine soldiers. Nagaland borders
Manipur.
   The report alleged that Assam Rifles soldiers tortured and
illegally executed at least 11 men.
   Assam Rifles personnel said the men died in clashes or trying to
escape, but Indian courts ruled two of the slayings illegal,
Amnesty said.
   It said women reported being raped by Assam Rifles soldiers and
that at least four children died in detention due to lack of
medical care.
   Amnesty said security forces in Manipur still retain the special
powers and that abuses contnue.
   It said the government failed to investigate the incidents,
despite calls from Amnesty and others.
   Amnesty said the Assam Rifles tried to cover up the abuses by
harassing and intimidating villagers. .
   ``Witnesses were arrested after testifying in court and a lawyer
presenting their claims for damages was threatened in court,'' it
said.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bargain hunters by the thousands
descended on an Anchorage industrial lot Tuesday to pick through
acres of gear unloaded by Exxon after two summers of oil-spill
cleanup.
   ``You really realize the size of the spill by all the garbage
that came out of it,'' said Anchorage aviation mechanic Rod Meeks,
who bought two outboard boat motors at the auction.
   Many failed to find the deals they had hoped for, however, and
blamed it on the crowd.
   ``We were looking for anything, but there's too many people
bidding high,'' said Doug Parr, a construction consultant who flew
to Anchorage from Seattle for the three-day sale. He hoped prices
would come down after the first day.
   It looked like the day before Christmas at the world's biggest
bargain basement.
   Parked cars lined the roads for miles in all directions. Ritchie
Bros. Auctioneers International, which bought the merchandise last
month from Exxon Corp. for a price Ritchie officials would only
describe as ``millions,'' ran shuttle buses into the site.
   There, an auctioneer was driven through the throngs in a booth
atop a truck, stopping here to sell dozens of all-terrain vehicles,
there for pallet after pallet of brand-new fishing nets, somewhere
else for containers filled with flotsam, from life jackets to
tables and chairs.
   Half the yard seemed filled with boats - aluminum skiffs,
inflatable power boats.
   Inside a hangar, pallets reached to the ceiling containing more
stuff: outdoor thermometers, clothing, even kitty litter.
   And the site was just one of three filled with surplus
merchandise from the Exxon Valdez oil-spill cleanup effort.
   The tanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in March
1989 and spewed nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in the
nation's biggest oil spill. Exxon crews worked that summer and this
one to clean shorelines, and plan to return next spring for a
shoreline survey.
   Exxon officials said they didn't sell any equipment that could
be used for additional clean-up.
   Ritchie Bros. wouldn't say how much it expects the merchandise
to bring. Nearly 8,000 potential bidders had signed up by midday
Tuesday, and by the end of the day, company officials said
everything on the first lot had been sold for a total of $3.8
million.
   A 1966 turboprop float plane with an old Esso tiger painted on
its tail sold for $435,000 to an undisclosed bidder. New, the plane
would cost about $700,000, several air-taxi company officials in
the crowd said.
   Four used television sets sold for $2,000 - a price some
frustrated buyers said was too high.
   ``A welding machine went for five or six thousand dollars - I
can buy a new one for seven and it has a warranty,'' said Steve
Pittillo of Anchorage, a drilling contractor who looked
unsuccessfully for equipment.
   Butch Johnson, from the Prince William Sound fishing community
of Cordova, hoped to buy some nets but feared they would be too
expensive. ``It's a feeding frenzy,'' he said.
   ``It's the biggest thing happening in Alaska,'' said a Kodiak
fisherman who wouldn't give his name. ``Prices are way out of line.
The people we know - the fishermen - aren't buying anything.
They're just shaking their heads.''
   Dan League, pastor of the Hillcrest Church of the Nazarene in
Anchorage planned to bid on tables and stack chairs for their
Sunday school classes.
   Melissa Stevison, co-owner of Alpine Aviation in Valdez, flew in
to buy one of 38 Valdez mobile homes on sale so the company can
have more office space.
   Others were there to see what effect the auction would have on
their livelihoods.
   Phil Lian, owner of a net supply store in Cordova, angrily
pulled out a notebook listing dozens of his customers whom he
spotted at the auction.
   He said he hasn't received orders in a few months - ever since
the auction was advertised.
   ``It impacts the fishing community when you put this much
material on the market,'' said Lian, who attended the auction to
see who buys the net and whether it will glut his market.
   ``This is depressing. We were impacted big time during the spill
and now again. It's probably cost us half a million dollars this
year.''
   Anchorage businessman Brian Watson, looking for equipment for
his water purification business, was in awe of the sky-high piles
of merchandise.
   ``People from all over the world are here looking for deals.
It's a great windfall,'' he said. ``The magnitude of this - and all
because one ship blew it big. That's amazing to me.''

<HEAD>National Airline Shakes Up Staff Following Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's national airline said Tuesday it was
shaking up airline and airport management following a hijacking and
crash a week ago that killed 128 people.
   In the first disclosure of the details of the hijacking,
officials said a lone hijacker who claimed to have explosives
attacked the pilot as he was making an emergency landing in Canton.
They said the pilot did not have enough fuel to fly to Taiwan,
where the hijacker wanted to go, or Hong Kong.
   For the first time since the Oct. 2 crash, the Civil Aviation
Administration of China expressed regret for the worst reported air
disaster in Chinese history.
   ``We are deeply grieved over this. We profoundly mourn the
passengers killed ... and offer our sympathy,'' said an
unidentified CAAC spokesman. His remarks were carried by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   ``This serious incident has revealed the existing problems of
the airport and airline company in their management,'' the
spokesman said, without giving details.
   ``It has been decided that a shakeup of the airport and the
company will be made,'' he said. No details were given in the
Xinhua dispatch, and CAAC officials contacted by phone in Beijing
had no information.
   The Boeing 737 from the coastal city of Xiamen was hijacked
early Oct. 2 en route to the southern city of Canton. The hijacker
forced his way into the cockpit and ordered all crew members but
the pilot to leave, said a report on the crash investigation.
   The hijacker demanded to be flown to Taiwan, but the pilot said
he did not have enough fuel and offered to fly first to Hong Kong,
which actually is farther away. Taiwan is 150 miles from Xiamen,
and Hong Kong 300 miles.
   The report said the hijacker threatened to blow up the plane if
it landed in Hong Kong, and the pilot finally made an emergency
landing at Canton's Baiyun International Airport as fuel was
running out.
   The official account conflicted with that of survivors, who said
the plane circled over the Canton airport for 40 minutes before
landing.
   The hijacker attacked the pilot as the plane taxied down the
runway, sending it out of control. It plowed into two parked jets,
one full of passengers and ready to take off for Shanghai, the
report said.
   The hijacked plane and the Shanghai plane both were engulfed in
flames. At least 128 people, including residents of Hong Kong and
Taiwan and an American, were killed. Forty-six were seriously
injured.
   No trace of explosives has been found, said the report by the
Canton Aviation Administration and the Canton Public Security
Bureau investigation report.
   It identified the hijacker as Jiang Xiaofeng, of the Hunan
capital of Changsha, a purchasing agent for the Linli County Goods
and Materials Bureau Development Corp.
   The report said Jiang was being sought by local police for
absconding with $3,591 in company money. He previously had been
charged with robbery.
   In earlier hijacking attempts, China has said the hijackers had
criminal records and were motivated by criminal rather than
political reasons.
   China has faced intense criticism for its handling of the latest
such incident.
   Aviation experts have questioned Chinese authorities' decision
not to evacuate the Canton airport while the hijacked jet circled
overhead.
   The flight crew apparently decided to fight the hijacking
attempt without considering the possible consequences. Chinese
flight crews during previous hijacking attempts also have been more
interested in thwarting hijackers than ensuring safety, the experts
said.

<TEXT>
   Charges that two former police generals
ordered the murder of a Solidarity priest are the first major
prosecution of Poland's old guard and officially reopen a case most
Poles never considered closed.
   The arrests in the case of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko come six
years after the crime that shocked the nation, and at the outset of
a presidential race in which Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
careful treatment of former Communists is being challenged by Lech
Walesa.
   On Monday, authorities also disclosed that a former interior
minister and six other officials have been accused of taking bribes
of gold and jewelry dating to 1971.
   ``In cases of clear crimes, party people will be punished. If
proven, these people will be condemned,'' Aleksander Smolar, a
senior adviser to Mazowiecki, told an American Society of Newspaper
Editors delegation Tuesday.
   At a Walesa campaign rally in Warsaw on Tuesday, a spectator
challenged the timing of the arrests ``right now before the
elections,'' scheduled for Nov. 25.
   But Smolar said there was absolutely ``no political
calculation'' in the arrests, which he said were ordered by
independent courts.
   He said there would be no departure from the government's basic
policy ``that our evolution to democracy should be as peaceful as
possible, trying to reconcile the two parts of Poland,'' rather
than waging a ``cold civil war'' against former Communists.
   Smolar said he recognized that the prosecutions of former police
officials would prove popular because of ``the feeling of
bitterness and injustice'' after 45 years of communism.
   ``There is a need of a clear moral condemnation, everybody needs
it for a sort of catharsis,'' Smolar said. However, he added, most
Poles understand the wisdom of avoiding purges.
   Those Interior Ministry records that survived destruction - the
Mazowiecki government did not take steps to prevent the burning of
documents - will not be opened to show who cooperated with the
secret police, Smolar said.
   ``It is extremely dangerous and destroys the nation to judge
people for their weaknesses ... in very harsh times, when only
heroes were able to survive with dignity,'' he said.
   The 1984 kidnapping and murder of the 37-year-old Popieluszko,
whose body was pulled from a river, gave a martyr to the
then-underground Solidarity movement the Communists were trying to
crush. Many Polish households still display photographs of the
priest that were put up during the 1980s as a sign of protest.
   Four secret policemen from the Interior Ministry's Fourth
Department, the unit responsible for spying on the Roman Catholic
Church and clergy, were tried and convicted in Popieluszko's death.
Two have been paroled.
   But no involvement was found on the part of higher authorities -
a conclusion that satisfied few and came to symbolize ruthless
communism.
   ``Something unprecedented has happened,'' Jerzy Jachowicz, an
expert on the security services, wrote of the arrests Tuesday in a
front-page Gazeta Wyborcza commentary.
   The two generals, former Deputy Interior Minister Wladyslaw
Ciaston and Zenon Platek, former head of the Fourth Department,
were charged with plotting the priest's slaying during September
and October 1984 and directing the Oct. 19, 1984 killing, officials
said.
   Prosecutors said the corruption charges were unrelated to the
killing. But among those arrested was onetime Interior Minister
Miroslaw Milewski, a former Communist Party Politburo member who
was Central Committee secretary in charge of internal affairs when
Popieluszko was murdered.
   After the slaying, Milewski was quietly dismissed.
   Milewski was given the party posts after being replaced as
interior minister by Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak in 1981, during
Solidarity's first legal period.
   Kiszczak, a Communist holdover in the Solidarity government
until he resigned last summer, told Polish television in September
that he believed the priest's killers could not have acted
``without the inspiration of someone standing higher then them.''
   He suggested the crime was committed by those aiming to
destabilize the ``reform-oriented'' Communist government of
then-party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, now the outgoing
president.
   On Polish television Tuesday, Kiszczak said he believes Ciaston
and Platek, who worked for him, are innocent. He said the
corruption charges against Milewski were investigated in May 1984
and a ``thorough report'' was given to superiors, but he did not
elaborate.
   The Popieluszko case was reopened July 24, three weeks after
Kiszczak's resignation, by the Office for the Protection of the
State, the smaller and tightly controlled agency that replaced the
disbanded secret police.
   The arrests made since Thursday open a ``new chapter in the
case,'' the government daily Rzeczpospolita said.
   ``The direct perpetrators of a crime were already judged. ...
However, unanswered questions still remain,'' the newspaper said.
   The corruption inquiry, which also targets two unidentified
other generals and two colonels, involves acceptance of bribes of
``great value, including many kilograms of gold and jewelry,''
Prosecutor General Aleksander Herzog said.
   The alleged crimes span the period from 1971, when Milewski was
a deputy interior minister, to 1981, Herzog said.

   A former legislator and leader of an
underground opposition group was arrested after secretly returning
from self-imposed exile, state radio reported Tuesday.
   The Kenya Broadcasting Corp. said Koigi wa Wamwere was taken
into custody in the capital city of Nairobi in a pre-dawn raid
Monday in which ``substantial assorted arms were seized.''
   The broadcast, quoting a government statement, said Wamwere and
an unspecified number of accomplices recently entered Kenya from a
neighboring country that was not identified.
   The broadcast did not indicate whether others were arrested.
   Wamwere fled to Oslo, Norway, in late 1986 claiming his life was
in danger. He continued to issue statements critical of President
Daniel arap Moi's government and in 1988 announced the formation of
the opposition Kenya Patriotic Front.
   The statement claimed Wamwere and associates entered Kenya to
organize anti-government activities among illegal hawkers and
operators of matatus, privately owned vans widely used as public
transportation in Kenya.
   There have been violent confrontations recently between street
hawkers and police trying to clear them from sidewalks.
   Hawkers also took part in July riots following an aborted
pro-democracy rally in this single-party East African nation. The
government said 20 people died, but the London-based human rights
group Africa Watch put the death toll at more than 100.
   Wamwere's brother, Charles Kuria Wamwere, pleaded guilty to a
charge of belonging to the Patriotic Front and was sentenced to a
four-year jail term Sept. 22.
   Koigi wa Wamwere had been an outspoken member of Parliament
before he was detained without charge in 1975 by the government of
President Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president.
   Kenyan law permits detention without charge or trial of
individuals the government considers a threat to security.
   Koigi wa Wamwere was among political detainees Moi freed on
succeeding Kenyatta in 1978.
   He was detained again in August 1982, two weeks after loyalist
troops suppressed a rebellion by junior air force officers. He was
freed in 1984.
   Two lawyers, Rumba Kinuthia and Mirugi Kariuki, were also
detained Monday.
   In July, the government began a crackdown of proponents of
political pluralism. Two former Cabinet ministers and the son of
Kenya's first vice-president are still in jail.

   The United States decided Tuesday to vote
against Israel and back a U.N. resolution that condemns the killing
of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem and asks a U.N. investigation, U.S.
officials said.
   But the Palestine Liberation Organization and non-aligned
nations opposed the U.S. draft resolution as too weak. They said
they would press their own stronger resolution, possibly forcing
the United States to use its veto power and infuriate Arab states
that backed the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq.
   The Security Council had been expected to convene Tuesday night
to consider the two drafts, but by late Tuesday the council
president had sent most council members home except for those
holding consultations.
   Diplomats reported scant progress in their search for a
compromise.
   The Bush administration's decision followed daylong negotiations
at the United Nations to avert a threatened U.S. veto of a
resolution that already had the support of the four other permanent
members of the Security Council.
   Officials in Washington said the U.S. draft condemns Monday's
violence ``and particularly the excessive Israeli response.'' It
welcomes the decision by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to send a delegation to Jerusalem to investigate.
   Israel already has rejected any Security Council mission, saying
it would infringe on Israeli sovereignty. But it has accepted
personal emissaries of the secretary-general in the past.
   The PLO and other states say the council itself must take a
strong stand and that findings of a council delegation would have
to be acted on by the council. The findings of a mission by the
secretary-general's personal representative would not carry the
same weight or convey the same urgency.
   The United States was considered likely to veto a resolution
that contained a call for a tough Security Council probe.
   America was ready to veto an earlier draft, finally deciding to
draft its own resolution because a veto would only benefit the PLO
and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, diplomats said.
   A U.S. vote against Israel would be the first since Jan. 5,
1988, when the United States supported a Security Council
resolution opposing deportations of Palestinians in the uprising
against Israel occupation. America usually sides with Israel,
shielding it from harsh criticism with a veto. Occasionally the
United States abstains.
   The council has been debating the killings on Temple Mount, a
site holy to both Jews and Moslems. Police fired on Monday on
Palestinians who stoned Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall, or
Wailing Wall, just below the mount.
   The mob had heard rumors that Jewish zealots planned to march on
the mount.
   Israel claims the attack was planned by the PLO to deflect
attention from Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The United States has claimed when it vetoed anti-Israel
resolutions in the past that they were not balanced or did not
accurately reflect the violence and provocation of the
Palestinians.
   But the current debate has been heavily linked to the Persian
Gulf crisis. Many Arab nations and others claim Israel should not
be spared from U.N. action after sanctions were imposed on Iraq.
   The PLO and some Arab states also said a U.S. veto would erode
support for the U.S.-led international force opposing Iraq.
   Bush told a news conference Israeli security forces should have
acted ``with more restraint.''
   The five permanent council members - the United States, Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union - met privately Tuesday to
discuss a possible common strategy.
   In the U.N. debate, more than 30 speakers condemned Israel's
treatment of Palestinians, demanded Israeli withdrawal from
territories captured in the 1967 Middle East war and called for
U.N. protection for Palestinians.
   On Tuesday, Iraq accused the United States and its allies of
``hypocrisy'' for shielding Israel over the years and failing to
condemn and punish Israel for violence against Palestinians.
   Kuwait's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, spoke in sympathy with Palestinians.
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and other nations joined him in urging
firm council action against Israeli occupation, just as it acted
against Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Paramilitary Game Rangers Kill Six Rhino Poachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramilitary game rangers have killed
six poachers believed to be stalking endangered black rhinos,
officials said Tuesday.
   The action brought to 10 the total number of poachers killed in
one operation to pursue two gangs that entered Zimbabwe in the
middle of the year.
   A National Parks' spokesman said four poachers of the six-member
gang were killed Oct. 1 in a gun battle in a nature reserve 485
miles southwest of Harare.
   Two poachers escaped but were shot to death last Saturday in a
shootout with anti-poaching patrols.
   The poachers were believed to have crossed into Zimbabwe from
neighboring Zambia, the spokesman said. He said Zimbabwe rangers
found two rhino horns and automatic assault rifles used by the
illegal hunters.
   The black rhinocerous has one large horn on its snout, with a
smaller one behind it.
   The horns, made of matted hair and cartilage, are carved into
ornamental dagger handles or crushed into powder as an ingredient
in traditional medicines in the Middle East and Asia.
   On Sept. 10, paramilitary rangers captured another gang of six
poachers who had killed 15 rhino, the largest number of these
endangered animals slaughtered by one group in this southern
African nation, the spokesman said.
   So far this year, anti-poaching patrols have killed 34 mainly
Zambian poachers and captured 14 others.
   The world's largest surviving black rhino population of about
2,000 lives in Zimbabwe.

   A major bond rating agency said Tuesday it is
reviewing the status of New York City's ability to repay debt
following a tentative agreement to give teachers a 5.5 percent pay
raise.
   After reviewing its A-minus rating of New York City's $13
billion in outstanding general obligation bonds, Standard &amp; Poors
Corp. could decide to lower the rating.
   ``I'm confident we are going to satisfy them that we are in
control,'' Mayor David Dinkins said at a City Hall press
conference. ``We have a plan. We are going to meet that gap.''
   The mayor has projected a $1.4 billion deficit next year in the
city's approximately $28 billion budget.
   The city has been hurt by the slump in the Northeast economy,
particularly by the declining fortunes of Wall Street firms.
   S&amp;P said it was re-evaluating the city's payroll burden in light
of a weakening economy that leads to lower tax revenues.
   State Comptroller Edward Regan said S&amp;P's move appeared to be
based on a perception of economic crisis, rather than reality.
   ``The city is not on the verge of an economic disaster,'' Regan
said. ``It's a cyclical downturn with an erosion of revenue, but
that can be handled. The problem is that this year's budget was too
large to begin with.''
   An A rating from S&amp;P means the agency believes the city has a
strong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds, although
that ability is more susceptible to economic downswings. A plus or
minus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within the
catagory.
   The next step down is a BBB rating, which signifies that adverse
conditions make it more likely the city would have trouble paying
interest and principal.
   Lower ratings make it more expensive to borrow money in the bond
market since investors usually demand higher yields for the riskier
debt.
   City Council President Andrew Stein said it was inconceivable
that the administration could give teachers a 5.5 percent pay raise
on Monday ``and then announce on Thursday that it was planning for
15,000 layoffs. This is not fiscal leadership. It is fiscal
folly.''
   The mayor has said he is considering laying off 15,000 city
workers to save money.
   Dinkins said the city has made it through past financial
difficulties and that, ``I can assure Standard and Poor's,
taxpayers, noteholders and the citizens of this city that my
administration will continue this tradition of responding fully and
quickly to the difficulties a deteriorating economy and rising
costs pose for our budget.''

<HEAD>Martin Media Adviser Calls Simon `Slimy,' `Weenie'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Lynn Martin's media adviser Tuesday
called Illinois Sen. Paul Simon a ``weenie'' and ``slimy'' and
promised a ``bang-up finish'' in the final weeks of the campaign.
   Roger Ailes, the ad man who worked for President Bush's campaign
in 1988, called a news conference in Chicago to defend Martin, who
is running far behind Simon in the polls and has had trouble
raising money.
   ``People like Paul `Slimon' Simon are the ones who are hurting
America,'' said Ailes, according to a tape recording provided by
the Martin camp.
   ``The truth isn't getting out there, so now we're going to have
to let people know about him,'' he said. ``There won't be anything
in our ads that's not true. It will all be there - but it will
hurt.''
   Simon campaign manager Anne Roosevelt responded: ``Lynn Martin
is getting awfully desperate if she's sending in her media adviser
as a hatchet man to call Paul Simon names.''
   Meanwhile, the Illinois League of Women Voters postponed a
debate between the candidates that was set for Thursday, after
Democrat Simon said his Senate schedule would prevent him from
returning to Chicago.
   Ailes said Simon has ``slandered'' Martin by running TV ads that
say the former teacher is an enemy of senior citizens and schools.
   He acknowledged that Martin voted against increasing Medicare
spending and against lowering the rate of out-of-pocket costs,
``but these were not votes to cut Medicare.''
   ``Simon is just being Simon which is unfortunately being
slimy,'' Ailes said.
   During the news conference, Ailes also called Simon a
``weenie,'' a comment that later led to an apology from Martin.

   Israel's leaders imposed curfews in the
occupied lands and mobilized troops today after police opened fire
on Palestinians who rioted at holy sites in the Old City, killing
at least 19 Arabs and wounding 140.
   Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip
demanded U.N. protection and announced a weeklong protest strike
beginning today, the start of the 36th month of the anti-Israeli
uprising in the territories.
   Monday's incident at the Temple Mount, which is sacred to both
Moslems and Jews, forced the Palestinian question back onto the
international agenda.
   It was the bloodiest clash in Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle
East war, when Israel seized the city's eastern Arab sector and the
West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - David H. Souter, a mild-mannered, well-read
and previously little-known judge from New Hampshire, becomes
history's 105th Supreme Court justice today after pledging to ``do
equal right to the poor and to the rich.''
   Souter, 51, planned to take the judicial oath, administered by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and almost immediately get to
work hearing high court arguments with his eight new colleagues.
   The oath requires Souter to ``solemnly swear to administer
justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor
and to the rich.''
   Afterward, Souter and Rehnquist planned to pose for
photographers outside the building on Capitol Hill before heading
back inside to take their seats on the bench for the start of the
court's regularly scheduled proceedings.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The super-rich are getting a dose of what many
Americans already know: rougher economic times.
   Fifty-three of the nation's 400 richest people suffered declines
in net worth this year ranging from $100 million to $880 million,
Forbes magazine said in its Oct. 22 edition.
   For the first time since Forbes began publishing the list in
1982, the minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking
dropped, from $275 million last year to $260 million.
   Among marquee names evicted from the list was Donald Trump, who
symbolized the 1980s era of living on borrowed money. Forbes said
Trump's fortune, estimated at $1.7 billion in 1989, was possibly
within ``hailing distance of zero'' because of looming loan
deadlines and a slow economy.

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The son of former Gov. Scott M. Matheson
believes the open-air atomic testing whose dangers his father
fought to expose caused the cancer that killed him.
   Matheson died Sunday at age 61 of multiple myeloma. He lived in
Cedar City in the early 1950s when the government conducted dozens
of above-ground tests 300 miles away in Nevada that caused
radioactive fallout to drift into Utah.
   As governor from 1977 to 1985, Matheson fought to expose the
dangers of those tests and gain compensation for radiation victims
- an effort that succeeded with the passage by Congress last week
of a compensation bill.
   Scott M. Matheson Jr. said Monday his father found it an
``interesting wrinkle'' that he was diagnosed with a disease that
Congress recognized as having possible links to atomic fallout.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
switching back to Cold War-era language in an effort to defeat a
House move to cut off U.S. aid to anti-communist rebels in Angola.
   In a private memo he sent recently to House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., Baker said ending aid to the Angolan rebels
would derail peace negotiations ``and would be a vote for more
killing, more stalemate and more suffering.''
   This is ``the absolutely worst time'' to halt the aid, Baker
said.
   The United States has been providing covert aid to the UNITA
rebels in the southwest African country since 1986, but
congressional sentiment against continued assistance seems to be
increasing.

   In the movie ``Reversal of Fortune,'' based on
Claus von Bulow's legal morass after his fabulously wealthy wife
slipped into a coma, his lawyer declares the Danish socialite to be
a ``very strange man.''
   Von Bulow, played with jaw-clenched control by Jeremy Irons,
peers out from behind a heavy shadow and responds, ``You have no
idea.''
   Off-camera, Irons painstakingly maintains the von Bulow
mystique. Indeed, he massages it with ice cold hands. And that jaw
rarely relaxes.
   Don't ask him whether he thinks von Bulow is guilty or innocent
of attempting to kill his wife, Sunny, by injecting her with
insulin and causing her to slip into an irreversible coma. Irons,
despite his extensive research into the role, won't say.
   ``Work it out, work it out,'' he implores.
   ``The court found him innocent,'' he flatly offers.
   Then suddenly things turn philosphical. Irons gets pensive.
   ``Is there a heaven or a hell? The sad thing is we don't know,''
he says.
   ``It's a great weakness of our society. We like to have
everything black and white. We'd like to know that if we think
Saddam Hussein is a mad dog, we're happy. We're wrong because he
ain't. He's a leader of a huge nation. That's what he is. So I
always question this desire to say `he's guilty' or `he's
innocent.' Life ain't like that.''
   Life for von Bulow turned ugly in 1980, when Sunny went
unconscious one morning, sequestered in her only sanctuary - her
bathroom. Their marriage was foundering and her children believed
their stepfather engineered her tragedy by pumping her full of
insulin. They hired private detectives and damaging evidence was
found.
   After von Bulow was convicted of attempted murder, he hired
high-profile Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz to
appeal, which is where ``Reversal of Fortune'' picks up.
   Director Barbet Schroeder has crafted a twisted tale rendered
somewhat implausible because of its narrator - Sunny (Glenn Close),
who, of course, is in a persistent vegetative state. How, you ask
yourself over and over, are we to beieve this story, told in the
voice of a person we already know has been left forever mute?
   But ``Reversal of Fortune,'' based on Dershowitz's book of the
same title, aptly depicts the couple's guilded, sordid excess: They
keep a pharmacy of drugs next to their bed, they guzzle booze,
sleep with others and then coldly detail their philanderings at
cocktail parties.
   And Ron Silver weighs in with his usual steely verve in his
portrayal of Dershowitz, giving the fast talking lawyer a wonderful
emphatic brilliance.
   Von Bulow's 1982 conviction in Rhode Island on two counts of
assaut with intent to kill his wife was overturned by the appeal
and second trial in 1985.
   In 1987, he agreed to a divorce from his wife and renounced all
claims to her fortune, including the $120,000-a-year trust fund
created for him before she lapsed into the coma. His share of her
estate was estimated at $25 million.
   Von Bulow, now 63, lives in London and will receive no
remuneration from the movie. Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow remains in
a coma at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.
   Irons recently spent an entire day pussy-footing around over von
Bulow's culpability during a tightly scheduled 24-hour media stop
in New York, wedging reporters in back to back, between photo
shoots and television filming.
   ``I'm very to the point,'' he declares at the start of the
interview at his hotel suite.
   While chatting, the sepia-tanned Irons reclines his lanky frame
sideways into a deep chair, swinging his legs and stocking feet
over one side so that his body forms a lazy ``u.'' He nibbles
grapes when he isn't puffing down Silk Cut-brand cigarettes.
Meanwhile, soup from a nearby deli grows cold.
   He's prone to one- or two-word answers followed by long piercing
stares. When describing von Bulow's predicament, he purses his lips
together and crisply pronounces it ``tricky stuff, tricky stuff.''
   To prepare for the role, Irons studied taped interviews von
Bulow had with Barbara Walters and Phil Donahue. He also said he
read all of the trial transcripts. And he spent hours interviewing
those who knew the socialite, although he never approached von
Bulow directly.
   Still, Irons is mum.
   ``I wouldn't describe Claus von Bulow because I've never met
him,'' he says. ``My reading of him is what I show on the screen.''
   Irons doesn't believe his portrayal of von Bulow gives him
license to discuss him.
   ``I don't want to comment on him because it's not my job, not my
position to talk about Claus von Bulow and I wouldn't think if I
was in his situation I'd enjoy reading what some actor thought
about him.''
   In fact, Irons prefers that the issue of guilt or innocence
remain an idelible question mark.
   ``I wanted to keep him an enigma,'' Irons says.
   Tricky stuff, tricky stuff - and very strange, indeed.

<HEAD>`Maniac Mansion' - Situation Comedy's Answer to `Twin Peaks'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Maniac Mansion'' is what ``Twin Peaks'' would
be if it were a situation comedy that was inspired by a Nintendo
computer game.
   Where ABC's ``Twin Peaks'' brings horror, violence and intrigue
to prime-time soap opera, ``Maniac Mansion'' brings horror, family
values and a crazy sweetness to domestic comedy.
   ``Maniac Mansion'' has Joe Flaherty playing the mildly eccentric
scientist Fred Edison, a man who looks like he's just realized his
pants are on fire. Deborah Theaker plays his sweet, nurturing wife,
Casey.
   The kids are Tina, Ike, and Turner. Ike and Tina (Avi Phillips
and Kathleen Robinson) are fine, but Turner (George Buza) . . .
well, Turner's been a 6-foot-4, 250-pound 4-year-old ever since he
walked into an experiment that went awry.
   Then there's Uncle Harry (John Hemphill), who's half human, half
housefly (with tiny human head and a cute, squeaky voice), who was
transformed by the same experiment that turned Turner into a
credible hulk.
   Harry doesn't seem to mind being a fly, although his diet never
comes up in conversation. He might even enjoy the life, since it
gets him away from his sometimes aggravating wife, Idella, played
by Mary Charlotte Wilcox.
   The series, airing early Friday nights on cable TV's Family
Channel, is suffused with a wonderful note of suppressed hysteria.
It's as easy to watch with grandchildren as with grandparents and
it raises important questions:
   How would YOU handle the hurt feelings of a typical 4-year-old
who's built like an All-Pro linebacker?
   This is the first foray into TV programming for Lucasfilm Ltd.,
which brought us the ``Star Wars'' and Indiana Jones trilogies as
well as the Maniac Mansion computer game for Nintendo machines.
   The game and the show have little in common, other than a
scientist named Fred and a mansion with a strange meteorite beneath
it that pulses eerie radiation.
   The TV show gets its edge from alumni of the Toronto-based
Second City troupe and others who brought us the Emmy Award-winning
``Second City TV'' in the late '70s and early '80s.
   Flaherty and Eugene Levy, a writer and executive producer of
``Maniac Mansion,'' were mainstays of an ``SCTV'' cast that
included John Candy, Andrea Martin, Bob Thomas, Catherine O'Hara,
and Martin Short.
   Wilcox and Hemphill are former ``SCTV'' writers. Hemphill, who
also played the fragile, booze-tremored barfly who anchored his
``SCTV'' kiddie show from a tavern, is a staff writer as well as
housefly for ``Maniac Mansion.''
   Is this just another formulaic, three-camera sitcom? Uh-uh. It's
shot on film, and Ray Brounstein's agile photography gives the show
a rich, distinctive look. There is no laugh track.
   Shows like ``Moonlighting'' and ``Twin Peaks'' won critical
acclaim for violating the conventions of series TV, ``breaking the
fourth wall'' with asides to the audience or defying viewers'
expectations of a linear plot.
   ``Maniac Mansion'' flings those conventions down and tramples on
them.
   In the pilot episode, the camera tracked past Fred and thumped
him a glancing blow on the head. (``Ow!'')
   The show, titled ``The 10th Anniversary Special,'' began as the
Edisons went to celebrate their decade on TV with dinner at a
Chinese restaurant. Uncle Harry the Fly chirps his anticipation:
``I've been regurgitating all day!''
   Suddenly the authorities announce they're spraying for Medflies.
The family - especially Harry - can't leave home. Fred realizes
that this leaves an incredible hole in the first act. How will they
recap the past decade's shows?
   Idella's home movies don't help. Film of her 1963 vacation trip
to Dallas includes a downtown picnic on a grassy knoll where
bystanders see something horrible happen off-camera and duck to the
ground in fear.
   There, behind oblivious Idella and her picnic companions, men in
raincoats and sunglasses carry away a rifle. ``You say no one has
ever seen this?'' Casey asks, frowning. No, Idella says. Why? ``Oh,
nothing. Never mind.''
   In a later episode, Uncle Harry falls for a cute girl fly who's
had a hard life. Born in a garbage can, she grew up in Chinatown
and got hooked on MSG. Ah, but when she flashes those baby-black
compound eyes!
   Eventually, Idella's suspicions are aroused and she begins to
believe she's being made a fool of by some cheap, little . . . fly.
Despite Harry's denials, Idella determines to eliminate her rival
by . . . murder! KILLING A FLY!!!
   Is there a happy ending? That's probably the nicest thing about
``Maniac Mansion.'' Underneath all that weirdness, the Edisons are
a fine, likable family, coping with absurd situations with dignity
and grace.
   And you'll never feel the same way about 4-year-olds or flies.

   The small-business community is becoming
distressdd.
   A survey conducted in September by the National Federation of
Independent Business showed confidence collapsing to the lowest
level in a decade, lower even than in the deep recession of 1982.
   The decline in confidence was across the board, encompassing
nine of the 10 components that make up the federation's optimism
index. Capital spending plans dropped, hiring plans weakened, and
inventory investment plans were cut.
   The survey was conducted before budget negotiators reached
agreement to raise taxes, but it hardly could have helped: taxes
were named by respondents as the biggest problem facing small
businesses.
   It was a runaway. Respondents named taxes nearly five times as
often as they mentioned inflation, and four times as often as
financing difficulties, which have been widely reported as being of
credit-crunch magnitude.
   The federation has conducted surveys since 1974 under the
direction of economist William Dunkelberg, now dean of Temple
University's school of business and management, and has published
the results quarterly.
   Rarely are monthly findings published, but the federation
departed from its usual practice because of the ``unusual
findings'' of the September survey.
   After studying 766 responses, Dunkelberg said the economy
``appears poised to enter an `NBER' recession, a reference to the
National Bureau of Economic Research's definition of a recession as
two straight negative quarters.
   While the latest decline was unusually sharp, Dunkelberg
observed that the nation's economy has been weakening for many
months, provoking the question of whether ``the process of undoing
the recession will be gradual as well.''
   The small-business optimism index is devised from answers to 10
questions, including expected business conditions, expected credit
conditions, current job openings, plans to hire and capital outlay
plans.
   The September drop of 3.2 points brought the index to 92.1 from
an August reading of 95.3 points, based on the 1978 economy
equaling 100. The lowest in the 1981-1982 recession was 92.5
points.
   Since 1983, the reading has rarely fallen below 100. It reached
an all-time high of 108.8 points in the second quarter of 1983, and
stood at 104.5 as recently as early 1988.
   While the federation's figures are gathered from companies too
small to make their way onto lists of the 1,000 largest companies -
some, in fact, are tiny proprietorships - it claims the results are
an accurate barometer.
   Dunkelberg observes that while the largest companies obtain the
greatest publicity, the smaller businesses represented in the
survey employ one-half the private, non-farm work force and produce
half the nation's private product.
   Historically, the survey has an accurate record of forecasting
the economy's direction, a record sometimes ascribed to the ability
of smaller companies to sense grass-roots consumer responses and
changes of attitude.
   Based on September's results, Dunkelberg believes the current
quarter may be the first one of negative growth in the current
downturn. Negative growth occurs when gross national product
actually shrinks rather than expands.
   Among other things, that report will reflect attitudinal changes
resulting from the budget negotiating now under way in Washington,
including reactions to any tax actions.

   Emergency rooms are overburdened with the worst
wounds of urban America: the gunshot holes from drug wars, medicine
for the homeless and uninsured, care for AIDS patients. In this
final part of an occasional series, ``City Faces, City Fears,'' a
doctor talks about ``war zone medicine.''

<TEXT>
   Dr. Robert Hessler surveys the gridlock of
gurneys cramming the emergency room hallways and makes a troubling
diagnosis: Something is wrong beyond the chest pains, broken limbs
and stomachaches confronting him.
   Each patient has a crisis, and has hurried here only to wait.
The emergency room is an overstretched strand in the health care
safety net, backlogged to the bursting point by overcrowding and
social wounds.
   ``The emergency room is overwhelmed with patients who need to be
administered to,'' says Hessler, assistant director of emergency
services at city-owned Bellevue Hospital. ``We do what we can
minute to minute. We're using every little nook and cranny we can
find to take care of these people.''
   Five patients are going to intensive care; four more to the
heart attack unit. Twenty-one have been patched up and are awaiting
admission to the hospital, including one man with an oxygen tube in
his throat.
   But the traffic doesn't stop with this batch of casualties. A
cluster of arriving emergencies queues up for riage. The worst get
seen first.
   Time passes with neither comfort nor silence in this makeshift
ward. Patients on stretchers stare at the ceiling without so much
as a curtain for privacy.
   Hessler, 38, patrols the area with a stethoscope dangling from
his neck and the pocket of his unbuttoned lab coat bulging with
diagnoses on a notepad. Delays are more than just an inconvenience;
they imperil the delivery of care.
   ``It's not a pleasant way to be sick,'' Hessler said. ``I'm
always afraid that somebody who's seriously ill has to wait longer
than they have to for a physician.''
   An average of 300 people a day pass through the emergency room
at Bellevue.
   President Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and other dignitaries would be
rushed here if something happened while they were in New York.
Because of its quality care, city cops hurt in the line of duty
prefer 264-year-old Bellevue, the nation's oldest continuously
operating public hospital.
   It also sees the worst wounds of the city: crack addicts, bullet
holes from drug-related assault guns, AIDS patients, the homeless
who have no place else to go for care, teen-agers run over by
subway cars who need their severed limbs reattached, inmates from
city prisons whose manacled ankles protrude from stretchers.
   At Bellevue, battlefield images fit like bandages on a wound.
   ``We're kind of a field hospital. This is war zone medicine. We
see all the casualties,'' Hessler said. ``We see everything here.
We are the window to the world. You will never go anywhere else in
the world and see something we haven't already seen at Bellevue.''
   Drugs are found in two out of three patients who are shot,
stabbed or hit by a car, doctors say. One-fourth of the trauma
cases involve people who have mixed two or more intoxicants,
usually alcohol and cocaine.
   The homeless seek treatment for such ills as frostbite and
rotted feet similar to soldiers who suffered trench foot, a disease
caused by prolonged exposure to wet, cold and inactivity.
   ``It's like a Third World situation,'' Hessler said. ``And when
it's cold, we see body temperatures of 66 degrees. That's almost
the equivalent of hibernation. Their whole body is cold, not just
their feet and hands.''
   The river of patients creates stress and frustration.
   ``A patient doesn't have things people come to expect in a
hospital - a bed, a room, certainly not a TV. If you have to go to
the bathroom, you get a bedpan,'' Hessler said.
   The clamor is a long way from the quiet calm of Hessler's
hometown of Billings, Mont. He spent seven years at the University
of Miami Medical School before doing his residency at New York
University, one of the country's top medical schools.
   Hessler specialized in internal medicine, but opted for
emergency doctoring. It allows him to do a little bit of everything
that interests him: internal medicine, pediatrics,
obstetrics-gynecology, and surgery.
   ``I like to work with critically ill patients. They make you
think and work the hardest you possibly can. You're keeping people
alive,'' Hessler said.
   ``You have to do the right thing in the first few hours for
whatever they have. It puts such a stress on some people that one
of the major problems is physician burnout. Some doctors aren't
able to function with that pressure.''
   Or the daily dose of death. For every rush of adrenalin that
comes with saving a life, there are terrible pendulum swings of
seeing people die.
   ``We're not God. Not everybody can be saved,'' Hessler said.
``But if you die in spite of everything I could possibly have done,
at least I feel we delivered the best possible care and did
everything we could have.''
   He stays, even though there are better-paying jobs with less
heartache.
   ``People asked me why anybody from the NYU training program
would want to do emergency medicine,'' Hessler said. ``We're a
setting of last resort, delivering care to people who don't have
any insurance, don't have any money and don't have any place else
to go. We're here because we want to help people.''
   On call 24 hours a day, Hessler escapes the bedlam of Bellevue
at his suburban home in River Vale, N.J. He eases the tension by
clipping his rhododendrons, junipers and yews.
   ``After a day of wild and chaotic work, I can go home,'' Hessler
said. ``I can trim the bushes, look at my lawn, water the plants,
watch the birds flying around. I'm used to a more calm lifestyle.''
   In addition to sewing up accident victims or treating kids who
swallow rat poison, doctors care for societal ills. A Polaroid
camera is kept to document suspected child abuse. A standard
evidence kit can store specimens from rape victims.
   In one sweep through the room, Hessler bandages a smashed nose,
takes vital signs on a heart patient, scalpels the bureaucratic red
tape so a patient can get X-rays and tries to find out why a
patient is waiting for attention.
   ``You're doing three, four or five things at the same time,''
Hessler said. ``You're working so hard you don't have time to think
about what you'd rather be doing. You're too busy patching people's
lives back together.''
   Splotches of dried blood, bandage wrappings, discarded surgical
gloves, bedpans, surgical tape, syringe cases and other medical
flotsam litter the floor.
   Patients stack their shoes, coats and other possessions on the
bottom of their gurneys as they wait to be released or admitted.
Their medicine is not sugarcoated.
   ``If you come to the emergency room, I can't give you peace and
quiet and comfort,'' Hessler said. ``And for people who aren't
critically ill, I can guarantee you a very long wait.''

<HEAD>Problem Diagnosis: Emergency Rooms in Critical Condition</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-City Faces-Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crush of patients has put city emergency rooms
in critical condition. The average wait is six to eight hours, and
one New York patient languished eight days before being admitted,
surveys show.
   The backlog imperils the quality of care in 41 states and the
District of Columbia, according to a survey last year by the
American College of Emergency Physicians. The Northeast and West
Coast have particularly acute congestion.
   ``It's a cruel illusion to dismiss this as a New York problem.
This is emphatically a nationwide problem,'' said Dr. Arthur
Kellermann, a member of the ACEP study group on overcrowding.
   The only states not reporting backlogs were Idaho, Minnesota,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and
Wyoming.
   The nation's 5,700 emergency rooms had 90 million visitors last
year, an increase of 30 percent in 10 years, according to the
American Hospital Association. There were 80 million visits five
years ago.
   The overcrowding crisis stems from a number of reasons: the
surge in drug overdoses and drug-related violence; the AIDS
epidemic; the fact that emergency rooms are a place of last resort
for the homeless and an estimated 37 million Americans who have no
health insurance; a nursing shortage; cutbacks in the number of
hospital rooms; and formulas for federal money that discourage
emergency admissions.
   ``We are on the verge of a major crisis,'' said Dr. Stephan
Lynn, chairman of the ACEP study group and director of emergency
medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.
   ``The lights never go out. The noise never turns off,'' Lynn
said. ``Some of my patients have no means to pay their bill and
some could buy the hospital, but all of my patients wait. When
there is no bed available, it doesn't really matter how rich you
are.''
   A 1989 survey by the New York state health department showed
that of 2,000 emergency room patients being treated one day, 210
waited eight to 24 hours for care, and 108 waited longer than 24
hours.
   The average wait in an emergency room is six to eight hours,
according to a survey of 300 hospitals in 43 states by the National
Association of Public Hospitals.
   At Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, patients wait
eight to 10 hours - four times longer than they did 10 years ago.
The emergency room is so busy that it turns away arriving
ambulances 20 percent of the time.
   ``That results in ambulances wandering around the city trying to
find emergency departments that are open,'' said Dr. Robert
Hockberger, chairman of emergency medicine at Harbor-UCLA.

<TEXT>
   OK, video kids, fill in the blank:
   ``Here's the story
   ``Of a man named - - - - -''
   If you answered ``Brady,'' get in line for the unlikeliest hit
on Chicago's theater scene: ``The Real Live Brady Bunch.''
   The show is a live, word-for-word re-enactment of different
episodes from the early 1970s television series, ``The Brady
Bunch.'' The all-adult cast plays it straight, from the dopey
sing-along theme song to little Cindy's irritating lisp.
   The show has become so popular since beginning its Tuesday night
run in early June that the 110-seat Annoyance Theater added a
second weekly performance in mid-August. The cramped theater in a
funky, North Side neighborhood charges $7 a ticket.
   If ``The Real Live Bradys'' is art - and not even the actors
agree on that point - it may be the first case of art imitating TV
sitcom life, a kind of life so far removed from the real thing that
it's, well, laughable.
   A concept this loopy could only have been hatched by people with
genuine affection for the Bradys: sisters Faith and Jill Soloway,
who jointly produce and direct the shows for the Metraform theater
company.
   ``We pay tribute to the Bradys, we don't disrespect them,'' Jill
said.
   Like the young professionals who fill the theater, the Soloways
are in their mid-20s and grew up watching the Brady Bunch, which
stayed on television from 1969-'74 and ran as an hour-long series
in 1977 before hitting the rerun trail.
   ``We were all really jealous of the Bradys,'' Jill said, a
sentiment also expressed by several spectators at a recent
performance.
   Brady envy? It's not hard to understand.
   In their suburban digs, the Bradys resided in a universe far
removed from the social and political turmoil of their times.
Teen-ager Greg Brady never worried he might be drafted and sent to
Vietnam. No Brady ever wondered if Nixon was a crook.
   Nor were the Brady children ever stressed by the dynamics of
their mix-and-match family: a widower and his new wife, her three
daughters, his three sons and Alice, their old-maid housekeeper.
   Brady family crises involved such mundane aggravations as Dad's
misplaced architectural plans and middle daughter Jan sneaking a
peek at eldest daughter Marcia's diary.
   And as self-styled Brady historian Max Merlin, a Northwestern
University film student, observed, ``their problems always worked
out in 23{ minutes.''
   Actress Eve Plumb, who played Jan in the series, experienced the
Brady revival first-hand when the Soloway sisters flew her in from
Los Angeles to guest star in one of their shows during the summer.
She played a bit part, choosing not to reprise her role as
pubescent Jan at age 32.
   It was ``a totally bizarre experience,'' Plumb said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles, where she is a rotating cast
member of the Groundlings, an improvisational troupe.
   She said she doesn't understand the Bradys' enduring appeal, but
thinks the Chicago show is ``sort of a hoot.''
   ``Brady Bunch'' creator Sherwood Schwartz, who also gave us
``Gilligan's Island,'' suggested the lure of the Bradys is mostly
nostalgia.
   ``It's something people have as a reference point in their
youth, and they hold fond memories of those shows,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles.
   But Chicago actress Jane Lynch, who plays mother Carol in ``The
Real Live Bradys,'' holds that nostalgia is only part of the show's
draw.
   She said the other half - the element that transforms ``The Real
Live Bradys'' from camp into art - is the realization by audience
members that the Bradys' uncomplicated lives were nothing like what
life turned out to be.
   ``A teacher once told me the purpose of art is to enlighten and
inform,'' Lynch said. ``This informs us as to what we bought into
as children and enlightens us that it was crap.''

<TEXT>
   When Simi Valley Adventist Hospital
gave a $25,000 loan to a young obstetrician, it wanted something
more valuable than money: his pregnant patients.
   ``You will attempt to bring 100 percent of your deliveries to
this hospital,'' the loan agreement read. ``You will attempt to
bring the vast majority of your elective GYN cases to this
hospital.''
   In return for ``supporting the hospital with your patients,'' no
money need be paid back. After five years, the doctor would owe
nothing. The agreement concluded with a plea he keep the deal
secret ``for various reasons.''
   At least one reason was obvious: It was illegal, according to a
later grand jury finding. State and federal laws bar doctors from
accepting financial rewards for sending patients to hospitals.
   The doctor, Vihe Azizian, an Iranian immigrant, said he didn't
know the arrangement broke the law. But he had no doubt why the
hospital gave him money.
   ``They weren't in love with my pretty eyes,'' Azizian said. ``It
wasn't a loan. It was a gift to put my patients in their
hospital.''
   Azizian's gift was everyday business, it appears, during the
1980s at Simi Valley Adventist, a 215-bed hospital affiliated with
the Seventh Day Adventist Church.
   Interviews, along with logs, internal memos and insurance
records obtained by The Associated Press, show the hospital
showered doctors with hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans,
subsidized rent, equipment and discounted hospital services.
   One complicated deal even made it possible for doctors to get a
cut when they referred patients for X-rays. The hospital kept these
patients' records in a school composition book rather than its
computer.
   ``There were things done that seemed obviously illegal and
unethical,'' said Dr. Paul Ironside, a surgeon. ``The administrator
told me some doctors would actually pound on the desk and say they
would take their patients away unless they got a check.''
   Offers of interest-free loans, income guarantees and other
subsidies have become commonplace across the country as hospitals
compete to win physicians' allegiances. But some of the Simi Valley
deals bluntly stated what most others only imply: The money was
payment for patients.
   Many worry that kickbacks, whether spelled out or implied, are
more than technical violations of law. They can harm patients. The
doctor has a financial enticement to send sick people to the
hospital that gives him the best deal, not the one that gives
patients the best care.
   ``Physicians are complaining that they made requests for new
equipment at the hospital and were told that money was tight,''
said Dr. Martin Wareham, Simi Valley's chief of staff. ``At the
same time, the hospital was loaning out all this money.''
   The deal-making at Simi Valley Adventist grew out of economic
changes that have made patients a coveted commodity. Government
programs and private insurers push hospitals to send patients home
sooner or treat them as outpatients. The result has been empty beds
and hefty competition for patients.
   In Simi Valley, the competitors were two modest community
hospitals. Adventist is a low, spartan facility built 25 years ago
against the dry brown hills on the edge of town. Its competitor,
Mountain View Medical Center, was an even smaller, privately owned
hospital on the other side of the narrow valley.
   As the one-time farming town was overtaken by the housing
projects and condominiums creeping northwest from Los Angeles, both
hospitals tried to persuade doctors and patients not to take their
business ``over the hill'' to facilities in adjoining valleys.
   ``They were struggling, and we were struggling,'' recalled Dr.
Elvin Gaines, a longtime Adventist family practitioner. ``It became
a competition for physicians and their loyalties.''
   Once the deals began, Gaines said, many doctors wanted in.
Gaines himself was a recipient. He got a $1 million construction
loan from the Adventist system to build an office building across
the street from the hospital.
   ``It mushroomed,'' he said of the deals. ``They said, `You
treated him good. Why don't you treat me good?' ''
   The hospital's current administrator, Alan Rice, declined to
talk about specific deals that took place before he came to Simi
Valley. ``As far as this administration is concerned, we are taking
an extremely conservative position on how we would behave as it
relates to marketing practices,'' he said.
   Most of the deals were struck by Darwin Remboldt, administrator
from 1984 until 1989. He declined to be interviewed, but records
and interviews show Remboldt established a wide range of
arrangements with doctors:
   -Hundreds of thousands of dollars were loaned to several
doctors. Among the largest series of loans went to Drs. George
Dichter and Geoffrey Graham to set up the Sterling Group, a
multi-specialty group. Gaines, a former member of the hospital
board of directors, said the two received as much as $600,000.
   A recently concluded county grand jury investigation found
Dichter and Graham would not be required to pay back the loans if,
among other things, they admitted patients to Simi Valley Adventist
for five years.
   Christopher Caldwell, the attorney representing the doctors,
declined comment on the grand jury's findings other that to say,
``There was nothing illegal or improper about the doctors'
arrangements with the hospital.''
   -The hospital gave special discounts on X-rays to some doctors,
who in turn were free to charge patients the full fee. Physicians
said a dual price list and a crude, handwritten record of patients'
X-rays were kept at a hospital reception desk. Ethical and legal
rules prohibit doctors from marking up patients' bills.
   -The hospital established an Ask-A-Nurse hot line, through which
callers were referred to doctors, who were expected to return the
favor by putting patients in Adventist. A hospital memo stated the
program would exclude doctors who placed their Ask-A-Nurse
referrals ``at a facility other than Simi Valley Adventist
Hospital.''
   -The hospital helped a doctor build a chain of walk-in clinics.
``The hospital thought it would be a good referral source,'' said
Dr. Walter Thomas, adding that he repaid hospital loans with
interest.
   Those who questioned the deals risked retaliation, Gaines said.
He said he was kicked off the hospital's board of directors
following a disagreement with Remboldt.
   The deals began unraveling in 1987 after the Adventists bought
the competing hospital. A doctor who lost a contract for staffing
Mountain View's emergency room filed a lawsuit bringing some of
them to light.
   Federal investigators looked into the case, and a county grand
jury called Remboldt and a number of doctors to testify. Many
declined, citing Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
Remboldt later spoke to the panel after he was granted immunity
from prosecution.
   The grand jury issued a report in June, stating the deals with
Azizian, Dichter and Graham violated California law. The question
was moot, however, because the three-year statute of limitations
had run out.
   Administrator Rice said the grand jury findings showed his
administration has met the letter of the law. But he complained the
panel's findings that earlier deals were illegal ``applied present
interpretations of the law to three years ago when circumstances
were very different.''

   Azizian, who cooperated with the grand jury, denied the loans
affected his practice of medicine. ``My admission situation did not
change at all,'' he said. ``I sent people where they wanted to
go.''
   The grand jury made no mention of the other specific deals, such
as the X-ray arrangements, and its records are now sealed. The
panel was highly critical, however, of hospital deals.
   ``Such incentives to physicians increase costs to public and
private insurance programs and ultimately to patients by causing
physicians to overuse hospital facilities,'' the panel's report
said. ``Perhaps more importantly, these incentives can hurt
patients by inducing physicians to favor one hospital, even though
other hospitals may offer better care for a particular patient
need.'''
   In Simi Valley, doctors remain suspicious of the hospital and
each other.
   ``I think a lot of it was the physicians' fault,'' said Gaines.
``A lot of physicians who went to the trough didn't have to. They
were making good money and didn't need it. It was wrong.''

   When some patients went to Simi
Valley Adventist Hospital for X-rays, a clerk entered their records
in a black-covered school composition book instead of the
hospital's computer.
   A special cut-rate price list also was reserved for these
people's X-rays, part of an unusual deal offered to a handful of
doctors who referred patients to the hospital.
   Confidential interviews, internal memos and secret records show
it appeared to work this way:
   A chest X-ray usually cost $56, and the hospital billed the
patient directly. Under the special arrangement, the hospital sent
the bill to the doctor and charged him $16. The doctor, in turn,
charged the patient whatever he pleased.
   Ethical and legal rules prohibit doctors from marking up
patients' bills.
   One variation on the arrangement was available to a few doctors
who sent patients to the hospital for breast X-rays known as
mammograms. A crude handwritten record of their X-rays was kept in
the composition book stored in the radiology department reception
desk. Those doctors, not the patients, were charged a discounted
$90 for the X-ray and $25 for a radiologist's interpretation.
   According to billing and insurance records obtained by The
Associated Press, the doctors then charged their patients $150, the
full fee.
   ``I questioned why I would pay the doctor separately for the
mammogram,'' recalled one patient, Patricia Gillesby.
   Her physician said the difference between the hospital charge
and what his office collected went to compensate him for extra
work.
   ``There are many, many times when I review a mammogram myself,''
he said.
   Another doctor who participated in the arrangement defended the
markup, saying he brought patients back for a second, free visit to
tell them their results.
   ``The difference was justified in our examination and discussion
with the patient,'' he said.
   When staff radiologists complained, they were threatened.
Minutes from a 1986 meeting of the Mid Valley Radiology Medical
Group noted that administrator Darwin Remboldt told one of the
radiologists ``that he would terminate our contract if we do not
allow it.''
   The radiologists viewed the agreements as bad medicine.
   ``There will be considerable confusion to patients, radiology
staff and referring physicians when sometimes X-rays taken in the
hospital are not the property of the hospital and no records or
reports of the examinations are made,'' the radiologists wrote in a
letter to Remboldt.
   Another complaint: Some of the X-rays were being interpreted by
general practitioners, not radiologists.
   ``They would read their own films and bring them down to us and
say `What's that?' and point to something insignificant when there
was something that was significant that they missed,'' said a
radiologist who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.
   Alan Rice, the hospital's current administrator, said he knew
nothing about the X-ray arrangement. Remboldt declined to discuss
it.

   When Darwin Remboldt, head of Simi
Valley Adventist Hospital, gave a loan to Dr. Vahe Azizian, he
spelled out the terms in a letter.
   Here is the text of the letter, written July 17, 1985, on
hospital stationery. Amortized means written off:
   ``This letter will confirm that Simi Valley Adventist Hospital
will loan you $25,000 under the following conditions. Acceptance of
these conditions will be shown by your signature at the bottom of
this letter.
   ``A. The loan will be amortized over 5 years at $5,000.00 a
year. Should you leave the Simi Valley area or change your
admitting practices, the balance will immediately become due and
payable.
   ``B. You will continue to work towards becoming an active staff
member at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, attend the OB/GYN
Department Meetings, and be active in Medical Staff Activities.
   ``C. You will attempt to bring 100% of your deliveries to this
hospital.
   ``D. You will attempt to bring the vast majority of your
elective GYN cases to this hospital.
   ``We both realize that much of what you have agreed to is being
supportive of the hospital and giving your time on medical staff
activities and supporting the hospital with your patients. There is
no other way for me to know exactly where your patients are going
other than your word and your desire to establish a good
relationship with this hospital.
   ``I hope that we have a long and beneficial relationship between
yourself and Simi Valley Adventist Hospital. I trust that this
arrangement will be kept confidential for various reasons.''
   The hospital may have had second thoughts about the deal after
investigators began looking into the way it did business.
   Azizian, in a sworn affidavit connected to another physician's
lawsuit, said Remboldt later asked him to sign a document stating
the $25,000 Azizian received was for his emergency room services.
   ``I refused to sign the document at the time ... because the
statements in the document were not true,'' he said.
   Remboldt declined to be interviewed about the letter.

   When six people were hurt in a car wreck a
few years ago, the surgeon on duty at nearby Parkland Medical
Center knew his small emergency room would be overwhelmed by all
the cuts and broken bones.
   So Dr. Paul Harper made a quick decision: Ambulances should
carry the victims to three other hospitals besides Parkland.
Spreading the carnage around meant the injured would get help more
quickly. The doctor felt it was best for patients.
   But in this case, what was best for patients was not necessarily
best for the hospital. Parkland lost business.
   ``I caught it for that,'' Harper recalled. ``The patients were
supposed to come to Parkland, even though they couldn't handle
them. The head nurse told me the administration was mad, and I
shouldn't do that again.''
   Such vignettes are common. Hospitals need patients. Doctors who
send them away for any reason, even for better care, risk rebuke: A
gentle scolding, perhaps. A quiet lecture about hospital economics.
Or worse.
   In Harper's case, what came next was much worse. His career is
in ruins. Once he performed 350 operations a year, the hospital's
busiest surgeon. Now he performs a dozen.
   Harper has filed a lawsuit claiming the hospital engineered a
slander campaign that destroyed his reputation and made doctors
afraid to send him patients. Richard V. Wiebusch, the hospital's
attorney, counters that Harper is in trouble because he is an
incompetent doctor, not because he is a financial liability.
   Such open warfare between doctors and hospitals still is
unusual, but the rules of conduct are changing. Many fear that
blunt coercion is becoming more customary as more hospitals press
doctors to practice a style of medicine that puts the health of the
institution first.
   Usually, hospitals try to keep doctors in line through more
subtle means: Nurses, who lose their jobs when hospital beds stand
empty, cajole doctors to admit more patients. Many hospitals post
names of those who fail to discharge elderly, low-paying Medicare
patients quickly enough. Physicians who don't get the message may
suddenly stop receiving referrals from the emergency room, an
important source of new patients.
   But gentle persuasion can turn harsh. Some doctors complain they
have been dogged by crudely planted rumors of incompetence, that
hospital administrators have ordered other doctors to stop sending
them patients or that their tiniest medical misjudgments are
scrutinized by hospital review committees.
   The worst of these abuses do happen, said Dr. Howard L. Lang of
Kentfield, Calif., chairman of the American Medical Association's
Hospital Medical Staff Section.
   ``It's not a daily occurrence,'' he said, ``but it is occurring
enough that it is not rare. We are not talking about a few whining
malcontents. There are real problems out there.''
   In general, hospitals want their doctors to bring in lots of
patients. They want them to order plenty of X-rays and tests when
the sick are covered by generous private insurance plans. And they
want them to do just the opposite when Medicare picks up the tab.
   Hospitals lose money when the elderly ill linger too long.
Medicare categorizes virtually all old people into DRGs, or
diagnosis-related groups. The DRG classification for a particular
illness pays a single flat fee for the patient, no matter how sick
he is or how long he stays in the hospital.
   ``DRGs encourage the hospitals to keep their costs down, and yet
the physician controls what the hospital bill will be,'' said Dr.
E. Haavi Morreim of the University of Tennessee. ``The hospitals
have had to do something to bring the physicians under the same
incentive. Many hospital administrators have felt the necessity for
some sort of system of carrots and sticks, either formal or
informal.''
   Perhaps the most feared and effective of these sticks is peer
review. This process is the main way doctors watch over the
competence of their hospital colleagues.
   Critics complain the system is sometimes perverted into a way of
punishing those who are economic threats to the hospital or to
other doctors. At its most extreme, doctors lose the right to admit
patients or to perform specific tests, procedures and operations.
   ``There is overwhelming economic motive to eliminate doctors who
cost the hospital money,'' said Dr. Verner S. Waite of Downey,
Calif. ``Doctors who complain about unethical billing practices,
unnecessary tests, using items the hospital can charge for that are
not necessary, are all at great risk of a peer review.''
   Waite has formed an organization to fight abuses of peer review.
He and many others believe that instead of weeding out bad doctors,
the system sometimes may protect dangerous hacks who are
financially and politically powerful because they admit lots of
patients.
   ``When they want to get you, they get you good. They blackball
you,'' said Dr. David M. Freedman. ``They will take away privileges
for nothing, when another doctor can murder someone, and because
he's in good standing they don't bother him.''
   Freedman works with Harper at Parkland Medical Center, an 86-bed
community hospital owned by Hospital Corporation of America, the
nation's largest for-profit hospital chain.
   Freedman believes his own practice has suffered because he
refused an order from a hospital administrator to stop referring
patients to Harper for surgery. Harper claims many other doctors in
this distant suburb of Boston also were warned not to send him
patients, in large part because he went against the hospital's
financial interests.
   Sometimes, a hospital can get rid of someone its considers a
financial nuisance simply by giving another physician the sole
right to perform that doctor's medical specialty.
   Ohio cardiologist Dr. Efraim Montesinos contended he was forced
to move his busy heart surgery practice from Toledo Hospital
because his patients often ran up bigger bills than were covered by
Medicare's flat-fee DRG system, which began in 1984.
   Said Dr. Peter Overstreet, one of Montesinos' supporters:
``Before DRGs, he was a hero. Since DRGs, he is a villain. It's the
same guy.''
   Montesinos said he cared for a large number of very sick
patients. They often took longer than usual to get better, so the
hospital lost money.
   ``I am in the service of my patients,'' he said. ``I am not in
the service of the hospital or the insurance company. As long as I
am a physician, I will do what I think is proper for the patient.''
   Last year, the hospital decided to give an exclusive contract to
a single heart surgery group. Montesinos, who could have bid for
the job, believes the exclusive contract was a ploy ``to get me out
of the hospital.'' He moved his practice to the nearby Medical
College of Ohio.

   Dr. John Gibbs, the hospital's director of medical affairs,
acknowledged finances played a role in the decision to change
surgeons. ``Most of his (Montesinos') patients weren't covered
under the DRGs,'' he said. ``The resource utilization was high -
the amount of (blood) pump time, a lot of X-rays, and the resources
of the hospital.''
   Hospitals now must go to considerable lengths to get rid of
financially rebellious doctors, but some fear it soon will become
much easier.
   Some medical consultants and attorneys suggest rewriting
hospital bylaws to permit ``financial credentialing.'' This would
allow review committees to consider doctors' economic profiles,
including the profitability of their patients, when deciding
whether to allow them to admit patients.
   Others worry doctors will shortchange their patients if they are
forced to put the hospitals' interests first. Said the AMA's Lang:
``When you base medical staff privileges on economic criteria
unrelated to quality, you are setting up a situation where the
patient can be harmed.''

   Once Dr. Paul Harper was the busiest surgeon
in town. Now his career is in shambles, and he blames his fall on a
hospital slander campaign he said was intended to scare away
patients and other doctors.
   Even Harper concedes his sometimes abrasive, sharp-tongued
approach did nothing to endear him to administrators of Parkland
Medical Center and worsened the situation.
   But he contends his troubles stem in large part from disloyalty:
He sent patients outside the hospitals for lab tests and X-rays on
up-to-date equipment. When accident victims needed more
sophisticated care than Parkland could offer, he transferred them
to bigger hospitals rather than send them out for a specific test.
   ``If that's his contention, it's the first time we've heard it,
and we certainly deny it,'' said Richard V. Wiebusch, the
hospital's attorney, who declined to discuss specifics of
Parkland's allegations against Harper.
   At a court hearing, he said Harper is ``a dangerous, incompetent
surgeon and should not be allowed to practice general surgery.''
   In the past 12 years, Harper said he has faced five malpractice
suits, an unusually high number for rural New Hampshire. Surgeons,
however, often face greater risks of malpractice suits.
   Harper once performed 350 operations a year. He now does a
dozen. He has sued the hospital claiming it put together a slander
attack to discredit and get rid of him.
   He said that hospital officials:
   -Told other doctors not to send him patients who needed surgery.
   -Spread word among patients and the hospital staff that Harper
was sloppy; he had too many complications and a high infection
rate.
   -Took his name off the list of doctors who received referrals
from the hospital.
   -Asked another surgeon to review all Harper's cases to look for
reasons to get him off the staff.
   Through peer review, Harper eventually lost some, but not all,
of his rights to perform surgery at Parkland. He said the list was
crafted to rob him of the most lucrative procedures.
   ``I can take out a gallbladder, but I can't touch the stomach,''
he said. ``I can take out an appendix, but I can't touch the
intestines. I can fix a groin hernia, but I can't fix a belly
hernia.''
   Some Derry doctors, on the advice of their lawyers, declined to
talk about Harper. But others were willing to defend him.
   ``When I started at that hospital 12 years ago, he was the
unquestioned authority on surgical abdominal problems,'' recalled
Dr. William Willetts of Manchester. ``He was a very credible
surgeon. He is not credible anymore at that hospital, but I think
he is still a good doctor.''
   A former emergency room doctor at Parkland who asked not to be
identified said Harper is ``no heart transplant surgeon,'' but
``instances of alleged incompetence were really sought after and
milked for all they were worth.''

<HEAD>Hospitals Consider New Method of `Economic Credentialing'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When hospitals want to expel a financially wayward doctor, they
usually try to build a case of medical incompetence. But that may
change.
   Some experts contend hospitals have a right to begin ``economic
credentialing'' - basing doctors' right to practice in the facility
on their financial prowess as well as their medical skills.
   ``It's a very controversial notion,'' said John Blum of Loyola
Law School in Chicago. ``Physicians are not used to being judged on
their economic performance rather than on their clinical
performance.''
   Blum recently surveyed 30 hospital administrators. While none is
using economic credentialing, he found many eager to have it
written into the medical staff bylaws.
   Writing in a health journal, John J. Eller and Sanford V.
Teplitzky of the Baltimore law firm of Ober, Kaler, Grimes &amp;
Shriver made the case for using economic yardsticks to select new
physicians and get rid of those on staff.
   ``Hospitals can and should consciously appoint the right mix of
physicians who will be economic assets to the hospital instead of
liabilities,'' they wrote.
   Among factors that could be taken into account, they said, are
how long doctors keep people in the hospital, whether they use lots
of hospital services for privately insured patients, how close
their offices are to the hospital and even how old they are, since
older doctors tend to cut back their use of the hospital as they
near retirement.

<HEAD>Mexico's First Nuclear Plant Now in Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAGUNA VERDE, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boxy, brick-red towers of
Mexico's first nuclear power plant jut into the moist tropical air
from a sandy beach flanked by palm-fringed lagoons.
   Not everyone is thrilled about Laguna Verde, a 654-megawatt
plant in southeastern Mexico that started normal operations in
August, 22 years after the project began and 14 years behind
schedule.
   The Federal Energy Commission says Laguna Verde, based on a
General Electric boiling-water reactor, will help power Mexico when
its petroleum begins to run out. Current consumption rates and
proven reserves indicate oil and gas production will continue at
least 53 years.
   Energy Commission spokesman Mario Santoscoy said officials hope
to begin two more nuclear plants by the year 2000.
   Spindly transmission towers march through the lush foliage into
the hills from Laguna Verde, in Veracruz state 190 miles east of
Mexico City, only three miles from where Hernan Cortez landed to
conquer Mexico.
   Many opponents are beginning to feel the campaign against the
plant is futile. Protests began in 1986, after the Chernobyl
nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.
   ``There is no possibility whatever to stop it because the
government proceeds without listening to anybody,'' said novelist
Homero Aridjis, president of the environmentalist Group of 100.
   Protests peaked in 1988, when tens of thousands of demonstrators
repeatedly jammed the streets of Jalapa, capital of Veracruz. The
navy was called in to end a nine-day blockade of the highway
outside Laguna Verde, which means Green Lagoon.
   A military post is still opposite the plant's main gate, but
anti-nuclear fervor has faded with time and frustration.
Demonstrations now are fewer and smaller.
   Most of the plant's foes seem to oppose nuclear power in
general, but many claim Laguna Verde is a badly built example of an
obsolete U.S. design that is poisoning the Veracruz coastline with
radiation.
   Nearly every claim by either side is disputed, and bickering is
more common than discussion.
   ``There are constant emissions of radioactive gases,''
environmentalist Roberto Helier said, quoting sources at the plant.
   Vinicio Serment Cabrero, plant information director, asserted:
``We haven't had discharges of radioactive materials, either liquid
or gas.''
   Critics pass out copies of official lab tests showing high
levels of strontium 90 in shrimp caught nearby. The plant safety
director, Sergio Zorrilla, has other documents citing later tests
with low strontium 90 levels.
   Opponents claim the plant was stopped 41 times during its test
run, including several emergencies. Officials admit to 30 or so,
but insist none was an emergency.
   A recent official study by nine foreign experts found the plant
had released only minute amounts of radiation. Critics accuse the
experts of bias. Helier cited studies showing even small amounts of
radiation can increase risks of cancer.
   Spent fuel from Laguna Verde will remain radioactive for
thousands of years.
   Critics also claim the lengthy test period - four times longer
than scheduled - indicates problems.
   John Ahearn, a member of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
from 1978 to 1983, said a long test ``can either indicate a lot of
problems or it can indicate prudent caution.''
   Former plant manager Augustin Perez Ruiz insisted it was the
latter: ``We did everything with the rigor of a novice. We didn't
want anything to happen.''
   Ahearn said a long test period might help train workers.
   ``The most critical element in nuclear power plants are the
people,'' he said. ``If you're in a country that has never built a
plant before, its going to take them a longer time.''
   According to critics, the plant workers are not well-trained.
``There's always a factor of risk,'' said Aridjis, the novelist,
and ``the most unpredictable of all is a human error.''
   Up the road from Laguna Verde, many people in the town of Palma
Sola have come to terms with the plant. A butcher shop has taken
the name Carniceria Nuclear.
   Hundreds of residents work at the plant, which helps replace
income lost when tourists began to abandon local beaches and market
vendors went elsewhere to buy fish.
   ``I was in the marches'' against the plant, said 30-year-old
Agueda Grajales, who sat behind the cash register in a hardware
store. ``Now I would not go.''
   ``At the beginning, we were afraid because they didn't tell us
anything,'' but now the plant ``is working and nothing is
happening,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Record numbers of Argentines are unemployed.
Brazil's economy has shrunk almost 10 percent in a year and
millions of Peruvians go hungry.
   A deep recession is spreading through many of the countries that
stretch south from the Caribbean to Tierra del Fuego.
   The free-market economic ``shock'' programs adopted in the past
several years have conquered hyperinflation, but at the brutal cost
of making most Latin Americans desperately poor.
   As standards of living fall, the specter of last year's bloody
food riots in Venezuela haunts the region's leaders.
   ``Every person has limits and we are now approaching ours,''
Javier Silva Ruete, former economy minister of Peru, said recently.
``The people are going to explode.''
   Anger in the Dominican Republic turned to violence in August. At
least 11 people were killed and 50 injured in clashes with police
after the government doubled the prices of basic goods.
   Days later in Peru, three people were killed in looting when new
President Alberto Fujimori eliminated subsidies, quadrupled food
prices and raised the cost of gasoline 30-fold.
   Venezuelan students went into the streets in July to protest
higher fuel prices. In August, the vice president of Argentina
predicted government austerity would lead to ``social
convulsions.''
   Brazilian auto workers rioted in July, burning 50 cars. Union
leader Vicente Paulo Da Silva called it ``a sign of the violence
that could erupt as a result of the workers' despair.''
   Violence probably will continue because governments have little
money, and sometimes little political desire, to ease the human
costs of the austerity programs they impose.
   Few deny that changes were needed.
   Inflation devastated most economies in recent years. Peru's
annual inflation rate of 3,000 percent devoured government revenues
and made it impossible for businessmen to plan. The poor suffered
as prices outstripped wges.
   Massive foreign debt choked many Latin American countries and
most virtually stopped payments, leading companies and bankers to
invest elsewhere. Local investors lost confidence and moved
billions of dollars abroad.
   Bureaucratic bloat and inefficient government services hampered
the ability of businesses to produce. High tariffs artificially
protected domestic industry.
   The crisis peaked first in Bolivia. In 1985, with inflation so
bad it took a pound of paper currency to buy a pound of bread,
President Victor Paz Estenssoro imposed drastic measures within
days of taking office.
   He slashed subsidies and raised prices, which cut consumption
and narrowed the deficit gap. He fired tens of thousands of
government workers and allowed many small businesses to fail.
   Bolivians protested, but inflation was brought under control and
economists declared the reforms a success.
   The Bolivian shock became a model for other Latin American
nations. Venezuela became the model of what to avoid.
   Venezuelans, accustomed to large subsidies from the oil boom of
the 1970s, were rudely surprised when President Carlos Andres Perez
ended price controls and raised bus fares in February 1989.
   Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Caracas, erecting
barricades, burning cars and looting hundreds of stores. For three
days, the city of 5 million was out of government control.
   When soldiers finally moved in to restore order, at least 300
people were killed, the government says. Human rights groups put
the total nearer 1,000.
   Months after the Caracas uprising, food riots in Rosario,
Argentina, cost 16 lives, so the risks were known to governments
that applied shocks this year in Brazil, the Dominican Republic and
Peru.
   President Fernando Collor of Brazil understood the lesson. By
raising the minimum wage while temporarily freezing prices, he
gained important short-term support for the austerity measures he
introduced March 16.
   Economic chaos allowed Fujimori no such liberties in Peru.
   When he took office July 28, the government was bankrupt and
only one of five workers had a steady job. There were severe
shortages of gasoline and bread and the worst drought in memory had
destroyed many vital crops.
   Fujimori's hastily prepared measures sent prices soaring 397
percent in August alone. The shock left the economy nearly
paralyzed. Many factories closed and sales declined 75 percent.
   Hunger became widespread. Emergency food aid has taken weeks to
reach the poor and some areas have yet to receive even one bag of
rice. Many people survive on a bowl of watery soup a day.
   Juan Jose Vega of the UNICEF office in Lima said the shock has
``tremendously and permanently affected'' the mental and physical
health of an entire generation of Peruvian children.
   Economic shock programs in other countries have been less
severe, but the recessions they provoked also have fallen most
heavily on the poor and the middle class.
   President Carlos Menem of Argentina managed to halve annual
inflation, which was running at more than 3,600 percent when he
took office last year. But shantytowns are spreading, hospitals run
short of drugs and crime is soaring in a nation that once had the
region's largest middle class.
   Inflation in Brazil is down from about 80 percent a month to
near 10 percent, but more than 1 million workers have lost their
jobs since March.
   There is little promise of economic growth soon. The example of
Bolivia is sobering: Five years after the shock was applied,
inflation remains low but the economy is stagnant.
   Even deeper recession may lie ahead. Most Latin American
countries import oil, which has become dramatically more expensive
because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   No one is sure how long the poor will wait on a continent where
guerrilla movements have been a part of life for generations.
   More than 20,000 Peruvians have been killed in political
violence since the Shining Path, a Maoist group, began fighting a
decade ago.
   ``We are a nation already at war,'' said Sen. Javier Diez
Canseco, a Peruvian leftist.

<HEAD>East European Diplomats Become Almost Common Sight at NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomats from Eastern Europe used to
have a hard time getting inside the heavily guarded NATO complex.
Now they are given up-to-the-minute briefings on the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``A year ago, just walking around NATO headquarters . . . would
have been either illegal or certainly incredible,'' said Tibor
Kiss, the Hungarian charge d'affaires in Brussels.
   He is among diplomats from Eastern European countries that
accepted an invitation from North Atlantic Treaty Organization
leaders to a ``regular diplomatic liaison'' with the Western
alliance.
   At their July summit in London, President Bush and the other
NATO leaders said the West wanted to share ``our thinking and
deliberations in this historic period of change.''
   They made the offer to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, all members of the Warsaw
Pact, the crumbling Eastern military alliance. The seventh Warsaw
Pact member was East Germany, now part of united Germany, which
belongs to NATO.
   The Soviet Union and Hungary were the first to accept, telling
NATO their ambassadors to Belgium would represent them, and the
others followed. Diplomats from the six countries have had about
half a dozen briefings at NATO, mostly on the gulf crisis.
   A senior NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the briefings illustrated ``the new post-Cold War era that
we're in. . . . We are no longer adversaries.''
   Henning Wegener, assistant secretary-general of NATO for
political affairs, gave the diplomats information on two meetings
in August and September of foreign ministers of the Western
alliance's 16 member nations.
   Separate sessions have been held with American officials,
including the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, and
Condolezza Rice, a Soviet specialist at the National Security
Council in Washington.
   No NATO secrets were divulged, said those attending the
discussions.
   ``I would not say these briefings are more informative than the
press conferences,'' one diplomat said, on condition of anonymity.
Others described them as helpful, especially the ones given soon
after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Kiss said Hungary ``certainly took into account whatever was
said by the West'' in determi ning its position on the invasion.
   NATO is wrestling with the question of how far it should go in
contacts with the ambassadors, known in NATO-speak as
interlocutors.
   William H. Taft IV, U.S. representative to the alliance, would
like to see the links expanded.
   ``I would hope . . . that we would at the least go well beyond
the idea of simply keeping these new friends advised of major
developments when they occur,'' he said in a recent speech.
   ``The point of liaison is surely something more - indeed, to
keep in touch before major steps are taken and to benefit from
consultation . . . before decisions are taken.''
   Some European countries, notably France, are more cautious.
   One NATO diplomat, who would not let his name be used, said the
invitation was a symbolic gesture ``intended to end the kind of
distrust the six countries had concerning NATO. It was important to
tell them our door was open.''
   Making the contacts more formal, by opening a new NATO office
for the purpose or granting the diplomats observer status at
meetings, would change ``the real objective of this measure,'' he
said.
   ``We have to have first a real debate in the organization about
what we want to do,'' the NATO diplomat said in an interview.
   Andrei Keline, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy, doubts he
ever will observe high-level NATO meetings.
   ``This is an alliance,'' he said. ``We are not part of it.''
   Still, Keline said Moscow feels the links offer potential for
military, scientific and economic cooperation.
   ``NATO is an important organization,'' he said. ``What we want
(is contacts that are) business-like. They should be deep, and they
should give as much as possible for both sides.''
   Hungary, which plans to leave the Warsaw Pact's military arm
next year, wants to deal with NATO on its own, not in a group with
the other pact members. Could the initial contacts eventually lead
to one or more of the Warsaw Pact countries applying for membership
in the Western alliance?
   ``NATO isn't seized with that question because nobody has
asked,'' the senior NATO official said.
   Keline commented: ``I wouldn't bury the (Warsaw Pact) right
now.''

   Nicaragua's health system is crumbling
under a load of economic chaos, shortages, corruption and
epidemics. Those who suffer most are the children.
   Diseases that were under control are returning. A measles
epidemic has killed hundreds of children this year.
   The rainy season brings the annual diarrhea epidemic and a host
of respiratory problems. Puddles of rainwater breed flies that
contaminate uncovered food. People have to drink unsafe water.
   Poverty deepens in range and scope. Malnutrition ravages small
bodies.
   Conditions are desperate at La Mascota Children's Hospital,
which has 240 beds and was built eight years ago.
   Dr. Adolfo Galan Ruiz, head of the emergency room, asked the
mother of a 9-year-old boy: ``Do you know how to pray?'' She
nodded, and he said: ``Then start praying.''
   The youngster had a leg infection and fever that began with an
insect bite. Because he was malnourished, the infection developed
into gangrene that threatened his life.
   Galan said malnutrition was the direct or indirect cause of more
than 40 percent of the deaths at La Mascota. Fifty-four children
died there in September, 67 in August and 118 in July.
   ``We have done what we can,'' Galan told the mother. ``The rest
is up to God.''
   Asked later whether he believed in God, he shrugged and said:
``No.''
   In three days, the boy was dead.

   Imagine free rent and equipment for your
business, a guaranteed income and interest-free loans. These are
some of the enticements hospitals give doctors to win their
patients. The deals are good for hospitals, but they can violate
the law, contribute to bad care and drive up medical costs. In the

<TEXT>
   Across the United States, hospitals without
enough sick people to fill their beds are plying doctors with
money, cheap loans, free offices and other gifts in return for
patients.
   A physician willing to move his practice across country - or
even across town - can pick up tens of thousands of dollars in
income guarantees, equipment and plain cold cash.
   When the nation's largest for-profit chain went looking for
doctors for its new North Monroe Hospital here, for example, it
agreed to pay eight specialists $1 million over three years to ease
their move from the long-established downtown medical center.
   In return for such generosity, hospitals typically expect one
thing above all: the doctors' patients. Or what they
euphemistically call ``loyalty.''
   While the deals make doctors richer and hospitals healthier,
they may skirt the law and sometimes break it. Federal rules
prohibit doctors from taking kickbacks for putting Medicare or
Medicaid patients in hospitals. Most states have similar laws.
   The American Medical Association's ethical policy states:
``Payments to or by a physician for the referral of patients are
improper.'' And the American College of Physicians' ethics manual
says: ``Collusion with any health-care provider for personal gain
is morally reprehensible.''
   Tying the doctor's financial fortunes to those of a hospital
injects a new conflict of interest into medical care. These deals
can influence - and possibly degrade - the kind of treatment
patients receive. Yet the sick are almost never aware of this
hidden partnership.
   ``If now it turns out that the doctor is in bed with the
hospital and they are both interested in the bottom line, the
patient becomes the victim,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the
New England Journal of Medicine.
   Medicare and other insurers have changed the rules of medicine
by shortening, and often eliminating, patients' stays in the
hospital. As a result, many hospitals are half-empty and eager to
woo doctors, their most important source of business.
   A doctor who gets money from a hospital might feel obliged to
send patients there when better care is available elsewhere.
Patients can even wind up in a hospital when a cheaper, safer
option would do.
   The deals also increase medical spending by tacitly, sometimes
directly, pressuring doctors to do more tests and procedures.
   ``Medical decisions on whether you take action or not are
difficult enough when all you have to consider is the patient's
welfare,'' said Dr. Henry Jones, a Monroe family practitioner. ``At
the very least, you're going to think more about putting someone in
the hospital when it holds your mortgage or is giving you help that
makes up a healthy part of your income.''
   Jones has sued Hospital Corporation of America, the owner of
North Monroe Hospital, alleging unfair business practices. He
contends his practice was ruined after he complained about such
policies and resigned as the hospital's first chief of staff after
the facility opened in 1984.
   Documents and depositions in his suit open a rare window on the
usually hush-hush deals between hospitals and doctors. They show
hospital offers of discounted real estate and loans, as well as
outright cash.
   Such largess did not come without strings. Some recipients got
notes from the hospital's administrator prodding them to admit
patients. One doctor said he was told loan payments could be
deferred if enough patients were admitted. Others spoke of
unnecessary, and potentially risky, tests ordered by doctors.
   HCA officials deny rewarding doctors for patients but declined
to discuss the deals, as did Arlen Reynolds, the North Monroe
administrator at the time. But in a deposition, Reynolds explained
the philosophy behind the arrangements.
   ``We assist them in relocating so that we can increase the
breadth ... of our medical staff, and one of the side results of
that is that you do get additional admissions,'' he said.
   However, Dr. Lee Roy Joyner, a founder of the group practice
that received $1 million, goes further: ``They wanted the
gynecologists who did the most hysterectomies, not the ones who
were the best doctors. They would make us aware of which admissions
and procedures were where they made their money.''
   The Monroe case may represent an extreme, but such deals are far
from unique. Hospitals of all types, from profit-making chains to
facilities with religious affiliations, offer incentives to bring
in doctors, and with them, their patients.
   ``You give me any major metropolitan area and I can guarantee
you there is dirt going on,'' said Steve Hirschtick, a Los Angeles
lawyer who represents doctors around the country in contractual
dealings with hospitals. ``Anybody who looks at these deals is
going to conclude they are illegal arrangements.''
   ``From attending conferences and listening to lawyers, it is
something that is a growing trend,'' said Harvey Yamplosky, former
chief lawyer of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'
inspector general's office. ``Everybody seems to agree that if the
government doesn't do something more, it is going to take over the
way people do business.''
   Among the most common deals:
   -Doctors receive cut-rate or free space in hospital-owned office
buildings or have their rent paid.
   -When doctors join the staff, the hospital guarantees them a
minimum income for a few years.
   -Many get ``signing bonuses'' of $20,000, $50,000 or more.
   -Hospitals outfit doctors' offices with equipment ranging from
photocopying to X-ray machines.
   -Hospitals pay doctors thousands for sham administrative
positions that require no work.
   -Doctors are given loans with little or no interest payments.
Sometimes, the loans are written off if the doctor remains a loyal
admitter.
   A 1987 survey of 114 hospitals by the Atlanta recruiting firm of
Jackson and Coker found 95 percent used income guarantees to lure
doctors. Eighty-eight percent said they gave physicians unspecified
assistance to start a practice, 52 percent provided free office
space, and 36 percent gave interest-free loans.
   ``Hospitals have to be aggressive to maintain the level of
admissions, and doctors are important to that,'' said Jackson and
Coker President Bill Dismuke.
   Hospitals long have recruited doctors to ensure their
communities good medical care, but the stakes have escalated.
Instead of seeking doctors from across the country, many hospitals
are recruiting from across town.
   ``Setting them up in practice is an awfully good way to win
loyalty,'' said Sue Cejka, a St. Louis recruiter. ``It's a way for
the hospital to engage doctors to admit to only the one hospital.''
   Physician loyalty is important in large part because tightfisted
insurers require hospitals to send patients home sooner or treat
them as outpatients.
   In 1983, U.S. hospitals were 72 percent full, according to the
American Hospital Association. By last year, occupancy had fallen
to 65 percent, even though 250 hospitals closed during the seven
years.
   All this has left many of the nation's 5,537 hospitals
scrambling for patients. And the best source is doctors. Steve Renn
of Health Care Investment Analysts in Baltimore notes that three
out of four people pick a hospital on their doctors'
recommendation.
   ``One of the top two or three ways of getting patients into your
hospital is to get the strong allegiance of the doctor,'' he said.
``To do that, some hospitals tie the physicians' fortunes into the
fortunes of the hospital.''

   Hospitals try to build financial ties with doctors even when
they are the only facility in town. But the quest for doctors'
loyalty can intensify when hospitals vie for a shrinking pool of
patients or, in Monroe's case, a new hospital opens in town.
   Before HCA built its sleek, 158-bed community hospital in the
comfortable suburbs on Monroe's north side, the city of 60,000 was
served by St. Francis, a 480-bed regional medical center in the
city's decaying downtown, and two smaller hospitals.
   To break into the market, HCA asked several doctors to open
offices next door. While HCA could not match services provided at
St. Francis, it tried to win over doctors with money:
   -To get the city's largest group of specialists to move, the
hospital assumed the $15,000 monthly mortgage payments on their
downtown building, sold them hospital land at a bargain price,
loaned them $2.4 million to build and equip new offices, and paid a
$60,000 cash bonus. Similar deals were given to other doctors.
   Shortly after the deal was signed, the doctors received a note
from the hospital administrator urging them to admit patients.
   -When the specialty group lost patients after the move, the
hospital agreed to pay its eight doctors $1.08 million over three
years.
   -HCA deferred payments on the group's loan for at least a year.
Joyner said an HCA official indicated future payments could be
suspended if the hospital was at least 80 percent full.
   Joyner resigned from the group after a falling out with his
partners, who voted to remove him as president. He also was dropped
from the hospital board.
   -Some doctors complain the hospital never called them when their
patients came in for emergencies. Instead, they were referred to
doctors who had special relationships with the hospital.
   ``What was unusual was the referral pattern from the emergency
room physicians,'' said Dr. Sid Bailey, an orthopedic surgeon. ``If
a patient requests a doctor, the doctor should be called. It's our
feeling that they were calling someone else.''
   Dr. Robin Lake, a member of Joyner's former group, denied
financial arrangements affected doctors' medical judgment.
   ``Arlen (Reynolds) would give some pep talks, like, `We really
need your support,' but nobody had anything to say to me about how
I practice medicine,'' he said.
   Lake also denied HCA deferred payments based on the hospital's
occupancy. Instead, he said, after a one-year suspension, the group
made loan payments until recently, when the clinic was dissolved
and the property returned to the hospital in forgiveness for the
loan.
   HCA officials declined to be interviewed about the deals, citing
pending litigation. A company statement said the chain helps
doctors ``to best serve the health care needs of the community. In
no instance are physicians rewarded for admitting or otherwise
treating patients in HCA hospitals.''
   HCA said all benefits given to doctors met state and federal
guidelines.
   Violations are tough to prove. The federal 1977 Medicare,
Medicaid Anti-Kickback Act makes it a felony for a doctor to
``knowingly and willfully'' receive any financial gain for
referring patients. Such activity can cost Louisiana doctors their
licenses.
   Most agreements between doctors and hospitals are carefully
worded to avoid a connection between financial benefits and patient
referral.
   ``The gray area is: Is the economic benefit for the doctor in
exchange for the referral of patients or for the betterment of
medical care?'' said attorney Sanford Teplitzky, who helped write
the anti-kickback laws.
   Many doctors and administrators believe they can keep those two
issues apart.
   Rather than bluntly asking a doctor for patients, David Glover,
the current administrator at HCA's Monroe hospital, said, ``It's
kind of done in a joking fashion. You might see a doctor in the
hallway and say: `Hey Doc, we've got one empty ICU bed. It's all
yours.' ''
   But some don't see the humor.
   ``It calls into question who the doctor is working for,'' said
Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at the University of Minnesota.
``Traditionally, you are supposed to have allegiance to your
patient first and foremost. Doctors shouldn't worry about losing
their cheap rent if the hospital gets angry at them.''

   Attorney Steve Hirschtick sometimes finds it
hard to persuade his doctor clients that they are breaking the law.
   ``One time, I was in a room of about 20 doctors and a couple of
hospital administrators, trying to convince them the low rents the
hospital was charging doctors were illegal,'' he recalled.
   Hirschtick feared the deal violated federal kickback laws that
bar doctors from receiving financial favors in return for referring
patients. Although the rental agreement didn't mention referrals,
Hirschtick worried it still could land them in court or worse.
   ``They kept saying, `Tell us who has ever been prosecuted for
this,' '' he said. ``I was considered Satan for telling them to pay
higher rents.''
   Under the 1977 Medicare, Medicaid Anti-Kickback Act, it is a
felony for a doctor to knowingly and willfully receive ``cash or
kind'' in return for referring a patient.
   Most states have similar laws.
   But ``knowingly and willfully'' has been a stumbling block for
doctors, their lawyers and prosecutors investigating allegations of
kickbacks.
   ``Proving the intent of the parties is sometimes very
complicated,'' said Thomas Crane, an attorney in the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Service's inspector general's
office. ``There are well-paid lawyers who help hide the intent of
the parties.''
   Prosecutors like Crane have been stymied for years by the need
to prove that a hospital's gift to doctors of free rent, equipment
and services was in exchange for their patients.
   Congress gave the HHS a new weapon in 1987 with the Medicare and
Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act. The law grants the
department the authority to bring civil cases against doctors and
hospitals before administrative law judges, rather than relying on
busy U.S. attorneys to prosecute charges in crowded criminal
courts.
   By bringing civil cases, the government does not have to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt the intent of the agreement. It can win a
conviction by showing the relationship between the hospital's offer
and the doctor's referrals.
   Doctors and hospitals found guilty under the new regulation can
be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While nobody
goes to jail, exclusion can be financially devastating.
   The government now is testing the new law in a California case
involving blood labs accused of making kickbacks to doctors who
both invested in the labs and referred patients there. Hearings
were held before an administrative law judge in August. A ruling
isn't expected until early next year.
   Meanwhile, HHS officials are considering new criteria, known as
safe harbors, that outline what deals between doctors and hospitals
would be considered legal.
   Under these criteria, which have yet to be published, hospitals
could extend financial help to doctors relocating from another part
of the country. Such benefits could be offered only for three years
and could not be related in any way to a doctor's referrals.
   But even if adopted, these guidelines aren't expected to stop
hospitals and doctors from making questionable deals.
   ``Our concern is lawyers will try to make seriously illegal
conduct look like a safe harbor,'' Crane said.

   An unpleasant diagnostic test known as
broncoscopy grew so popular for a time among doctors at North
Monroe Hospital that some of them made up a ditty about it.
   ``He bronchs them once, he bronchs them twice, he bronchs them
once again,'' the doctors crooned.
   Dr. Henry Jones mentioned the popularity of this procedure and
the song when he gave a deposition in a lawsuit against the
hospital and its owners, Hospital Corporation of America.
   Other doctors also worried about the apparent zeal with which
this and other tests and procedures were done at the hospital. Dr.
George Ellis, in another sworn deposition, said some doctors who
had received hospital favors overused bronchoscopy, a potentially
risky procedure in which a tube is threaded into the lungs to look
for disease.
   ``I think they performed bronchoscopy when it was unnecessary,
and I think they did it too often on patients,'' said the
radiologist. He complained to hospital staff and said he soon saw
his own referrals disappear.
   Dr. David Raines told of one of his patients who went to the
North Monroe emergency room with chest pains. The man was admitted
and referred to a cardiologist. The cardiologist sent him to a
pulmonary specialist, then an ear, nose and throat doctor, then a
rheumetologist. Each specialist performed a series of hospital
tests.
   ``He was aggressively investigated, which was obviously a
financial thing,'' said Raines.
   Hospital officials declined comment, citing pending litigation.

<HEAD>Motorola Announces Settlement of Patent Infringement Suit With
Hitachi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. said Monday it has settled
a patent infringement lawsuit, which twice had threatened to cut
off supplies of key parts to American computer manufacturers.
   Terms of the settlement with Hitachi Ltd. were not disclosed,
but Motorola executive James A. Norling said he was pleased.
   ``Our unwavering goals in this legal action were to protect
Motorola's intellectual property and to assure our customers an
uninterrupted supply of Motorola's leadership microprocessors,''
said Norling, president and general manager of the company's
semiconductor products sector.
   Motorola sued Hitachi nearly two years ago in U.S. District
Court in Austin, Texas, accusing the Japanese company of using
certain microprocessor designs patented by Motorola.
   Hitachi countered by accusing Motorola of patent infringement
when the Chicago-area company developed its widely used 68030 chip.
   A federal judge in Texas twice ordered the companies to stop
selling their chips in the United States and to try to work out a
settlement. The orders were stayed in both cases.
   The lawsuits involved Hitachi's H8 and H16 microcontrollers
and Motorola's 68030 and 88000 microprocessors.

<HEAD>Chances Fading for Employee Buyout o UAL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said Monday a proposed employee buyout
of United Airlines' parent company is less likely with the
unraveling of $2 billion in hoped-for bank financing.
   Rising oil prices and tight credit caused by the Persian Gulf
crisis prompted banks to balk at committing the necessary loans to
underwrite a bid in time to meet an Oct. 9 deadline, said Gerald
Greenwald, head of the United Employee Acquisition Corp., which has
been trying to engineer the buyout.
   ``The final chapter in this drama has not been written yet, but
we're getting close,'' said Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
in New York. ``It's almost dead.''
   ``At this point, I think coming up with a viable deal,
especially by the deadline, which is tomorrow, is a pretty long
shot,'' said Robert Decker of Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. ``The more
likely alternative is they're going to try to ask for some more
time from the board, or time to put together another deal.''
   But Greenwald said Monday by telephone from New York, ``We don't
have a plan of that type right now.''
   He said he did not know what the group would do if the board
rejected its restructured offer, which will depend on financing
from other sources.
   Greenwald's group announced Sunday it had failed for the second
time in two months to assemble bank backing for its bid for UAL
Corp.
   The group said it would instead depend on financing consisting
of loans from suppliers; revenue from sale-leaseback arrangements,
in which the company sells equipment such as airplanes and leases
them back; employee investments; and cash on hand.
   ``We're trying to come to the board with...an equally attractive
package,'' Greenwald said Sunday. ``We are trying to make up the
shortfall in cash with some other features.''
   The group said it would present a new offer at a UAL board
meeting Tuesday.
   The group declined to estimate the value of its restructured
bid, saying only it would be substantially higher than the current
price of UAL stock, which closed down $10.75 per share at $92
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The employees last week had been trying to put together a deal
believed to value the Chicago-based company at $165 to $175 a
share, or $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified source in its Tuesday
editions as saying the buyout group has put together an offer of
$160 a share, or $3.5 billion.
   That was considerably less than the $201-a-share offer they had
been working to assemble when the board granted them an extension
to try to solidify bank financing two months ago.
   Analyst Stephen Dexter of Kemper Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago said the company should be worth more than rival American
Airlines, whose stock two months ago indicated the airline was
worth $3.8 billion.
   Dexter said Sunday he believed United suppliers such as
Seattle-based Boeing Co. and Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft in Hartford,
Conn., would be unlikely to want to support the employee bid.
   ``The vendors are really hesitant,'' he said. ``It's logical
why. If Boeing finances United, they risk upsetting everyone else
they're trying to sell airplanes to - Delta, Japan Airlines. It
opens up a whole Pandora's box.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A coalition of children's advocates and
educators wanted President Bush to sign legislation that would
require TV stations to pay more attention to the educational needs
of young viewers.
   Children's TV advocates said a typical child may watch 10,000
hours to 15,000 hours of television - including 200,000 commercials
- before age 18.
   Broadcasters say they can live with the measure, which would
also restrict the number of commercials on kids' shows, but a White
House spokesman said Bush has strong reservations.

   HOUSTON (AP) - Texas and Oklahoma led an increase in the number

   The toolmaker reported Monday the count was up from last week's
1,047, and was above the number for the same week a year ago when
960 rigs were working across the country.
   A Baker Hughes vice president said the rig count dropped the
last two weeks and ``this may be getting back on the seasonal
track.''

   MOSCOW (AP) - Trading on a Soviet stock exchange could start
next year, but foreigners probably will remain on the sidelines
until the ruble is convertible, the chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange said.
   ``It's not going to look like some kind of enormous exchange . .
. but it could begin in a modest way,'' chairman John Phelan Jr.
said in an interview Monday at Moscow's international trade center.
   Phelan and a delegation of Wall Street businessmen were invited
to Moscow to give a seminar on running a stock market. Dealings in
stocks and bonds has been illegal in the Soviet Union since the
1917 communist revolution.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A plan to create a ew rail link between key
East Coast ports and the Canadian interior may fall apart because
of a 15-mile stretch of tracks between Buffalo and Niagara Falls,
N.Y.
   The tracks - known as the Buffalo-Niagara Gateway - belong to
the Consolidated Rail Corp., which has gone to a special court over
the dispute with Canadian Pacific Ltd.
   ``I wouldn't want to be in the position of saying what's
motivating Conrail in all of this but certainly a major competitor
in their back yard has got to be of concern to them,'' Canadian
Pacific spokesman John Cox said last week.

   Why does a golfer wear two pairs of
socks?
   In case he gets a hole in one.
   Telling jokes like that, Michael Pasternak and Allen Sullivan
have expanded an enterprise that began as a sample sock sale out of
a pickup truck, into Socks Galore - an $18 million-a-year chain of
62 stores in 34 states.
   Pasternak, a former education professor at Vanderbilt
University, and Sullivan, his one-time graduate student, call
themselves the Sock Docs.
   Food and clothing giant Sara Lee Corp. bought their chain for an
undisclosed price in 1989, shortly after buying Adams Millis, one
of the nation's largest hosiery mills.
   Pasternak and Sullivan's freewheeling business tactics range
from attending sales meetings in clown suits and other disguises to
performing skits. They sell their socks with the instructions
``TGIF,'' or toe goes in first.
   The deal with Sara Lee included long-term management contracts
under which Pasternak and Sullivan will continue running the chain
with the same unorthodox methods.
   ``Their management style and their personalities were certainly
an attractive part of the acquisition,'' company spokeswoman Ann
McCarthy said.
   Socks Galore made its retail debut as a kiosk in a Nashville
shopping mall with one employee. It opened in time for the
Christmas rush of 1981.
   ``We sold 34,000 pairs of socks. That's when we knew we really
were on to something,'' Pasternak said.
   In 1982, they opened the first permanent store in Murfreesboro,
Tenn., at the Outlets Ltd. Mall.
   ``I'd run the Murfreesboro store in the daytime, and Allen would
teach all day and run the store at night,'' Pasternak said.
   Pasternak and Sullivan operate with a set of principles they say
they developed from lessons learned over the past decade.
   They were taught the first when buyers flocked to the sale at
the pickup truck, Pasternak said.
   ``We learned on the side of the road about variety,'' he said.
``Why else would we have 60,000 pairs of socks in a store?''
   They also learned about sock quality along the way. They sell
only American-made socks, believing the quality is superior to that
of Korean-made socks, even though they cost up to twice as much.
   Yet another lesson was to shun professional salespeople.
   ``They're too greedy,'' Sullivan said.
   So Socks Galore hires non-professionals and trains them at the
sock doc ``college'' in Franklin, Tenn.
   Socks Galore made about $18 million in sales last year, a small
percentage of Sara Lee's $11.7 illion annual revenues.
   The parent refused to give projections for 1990, but Pasternak
and Sullivan said they don't expect their business to suffer during
the current economic slowdown. After all, they founded the company
during a recession on $1,500 in cash and a $5,000 loan at 18
percent interest.
   ``In that recession, women would buy clothes, but men wouldn't
buy suits,'' Pasternak said. ``They'd buy socks or ties, but they
wouldn't buy suits.''
   They said they expect that pattern to continue.
   Fashion trends they see for socks include lots of colors for
women and children. Men's socks will continue to be dark, but
subtle designs should become more popular, they said.

<HEAD>European Ski Resorts Create Buffers Against Bad Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS REDMONT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sobered by two snow-scarce seasons, European winter resorts hope
to lure skiers back to the slopes this year with massive
investments in snow-making machines.
   They'll also rely on an array of substitute activities ranging
from winter golf and horseback riding to sled dog runs and cooking
classes, just in case the flakes are short again this year.
   Europe's oldest resort, Italy's Sestrieres, reeled out the lure
as soon as the summer ended. It's offering a $636 half-price, early
purchase season ticket for more than 100 lifts over 250 miles along
the Franco-Italian border.
   West Germany's resorts are offering three-hour lift tickets,
while Garmisch Partenkirchen has invested in ``snow cannons'' to
avoid calling off World Cup ski races for the fourth season in a
row.
   Such precautions are not surprising after Europe's last two mild
winters, which triggered a crisis in the Western Alps. Some resorts
closed early or drastically curtailed their season.
   Conditions were better on the eastern side of Europe's central
range, where damage was held to a 3 percent attendance drop.
   Faring much better were high-altitude resorts, some of which
offer year-round skiing at elevations over 11,000 feet. France's
glaciers at Les Deux Alpes and Alpe d'Huez attracted thousands of
Italians over the border, while Hinterdux and Sulden in Austria
became hot places to ski.
   But European manufacturers were hurt. France's Rossignol and
Yugoslavia's Elan ski factories posted record losses and Salomon
bindings reduced its sponsorship to 30 World Cup skiers.
   This year, the resorts have come up with a number of incentives
to boost their business.
   The season ticket for Sestrieres in Italy includes free access
to health clubs, medical insurance and helicopter evacuation in
case of accident, free ski lessons for children under 7, free
tickets for a race in the World ski championship on Dec. 11,
discounts on mountain bike purchases and free access to a winter
golf driving range.
   More incentives are found at Italy's French-speaking Val d'Aosta
area, at the foot of Mont Blanc. The resorts of Courmayeur and Pila
have poured $10 million into new snow-making equipment in 12
valleys and started regular helicopter ski runs with mountain
guides.
   Cross-country skiers are a being wooed by low, $5 rental fees,
while canine fans can try their rein with Siberian and Alaskan
huskies and Alaskan malamutes at the Mont Blanc sled dog school.
   Italy's Dolomite range, with its ``Superski Dolomiti'' skipass
allowing access to 12 resorts and 450 lifts, has started a new
``vacation on the move'' formula. Skiers may glide off every 48
hours to a new town, while their suitcases are sent by bus to the
next hotel on their itinerary.
   ``Our main problem has been to get the correct information on
the weather to skiers abroad,'' says Franz Peradoner, director of
the Dolomiti formula. ``While skiers might have been sobbing in one
mountain valley, others could have been kicking up powder in
another place where the snowfall hit.''
   Swiss resorts seem to have suffered the least from scarce
snowflakes. Zermatt recorded a 12.9 percent increase in foreign
visitors, thanks to its glacier skiing. St. Moritz, where fewer
than half of its visitors seek downhill activities, has diversified
into cross-country, winter cricket, polo games in the snow,
greyhound racing and horse jumping.
   There are some positive signs for the European resorts.
Austria's Saalbach is hosting the World Ski championships in
February, and many resorts are already booked for the Christmas and
traditional carnival vacations.
   Sweden and other Scandinavian countries are enjoying a
mini-boom, reinforced by a ``snow guarantee'' triggering a
reimbursement in case the flakes do not fall.
   And in Switzerland, some resorts like Wengen and Muerren are so
popular that hotel owners accept reservations from their regular
clients only on alternate years. The French speaking Valais area
has launched a lift card for use in the entire province, while
sunny resorts like Crans Montana are offering golf in the snow,
hiking and outdoor tennis.

   Representatives of four former Soviet bloc
countries are meeting with officials of the oldest U.S. stock
exchange to find ways of easing their transition to free market
economies.
   The exchange is marking its 200th anniversary with a three-day
gathering ending today to discuss the dangers and opportunities in
Eastern Europe now that communism is retreating.
   And officials from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania
are here to win friends and interest investors.
   ``This is not just the anniversary of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange,'' said Nicholas Giordano, president of the exchange,
``this is the anniversary of free markets.''
   ``As an exchange we wish to be a force in this economic
revolution and we are excited about the opening of these markets,''
said Joseph Rizzello, president of the Philadelphia Board of Trade,
an exchange subsidiary.
   At a closed session Sunday, the East Europeans met with
Giordano, Rizzello, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden and others to discuss areas of potential
cooperation including:
   - developing a program for East European officials to receive
on-the-job training at Philadelphia and other exchanges;
   - bringing companies listed on the Philadelphia exchange
together with their opposite numbers in East Europe for possible
joint ventures and;
   - supplying technical assistance in developing investment funds
to support privatization of state-owned enterprises.
   The gathering, the first meeting of the exchange's committee for
exploring capital formation in Eastern Europe, comes as officials
of the much larger New York Stock Exchange visit Moscow, discussing
opening an exchange in the Soviet Union.
   The Philadelphia exchange, although smaller, has been an
aggressive leader in developing innovative financial products like
foreign currency options.
   Giordano still thinks his exchange has a lot to offer the
embryonic markets of Eastern Europe grappling with basic issues
like private property rights and what to do with ailing,
money-losing state-owned industries.
   ``We think the experience of the smaller exchanges could be more
practical for us to start with,'' said former Soviet economist
Stanislav Menshikov, who attended the conference.
   Topics discussed included the need for a central banking system,
how quickly the Eastern Europeans can move from state-ownership to
privitization and the effect of problems in other countries.
   Jaromir ovotny, economic advisor to the mayor of Prague, said
Iraq owes his country $1.4 billion that was going to be repaid in
oil until the worldwide embargo was imposed after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   He noted the now-defunct East German government owed
Czechoslavakia more than $1 billion but despite that and other
economic woes ``Czechoslavakia is still alive and still
functioning.''
   Marton Tardos, a member of the Hungarian Parliament said the
problem would be getting people to accept inevitable short-term
hardship for long term economic gains.
   ``Without shock, without pain you cannot go forward,'' he said,
adding ``introducing a new system is a painful process.''
   Breeden, who attended the reopening of the Budapest Stock
Exchange in June, has formed his own advisory committee to suggest
ways Wall Street can help the fledgling economies.
   ``We very much wanted to mobilize the resources of the American
private sector,'' said Breeden, who has met previously with
financial officials from the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and what
used to be East Germany.

   United Parcel Service is betting 888
tiny black hexagons will ease the organized chaos of delivering 12
million packages a day.
   The hexagons, printed on a small square label, hold 100 letters
or numbers that a computer can read. That's five times the
information provided by traditional bar codes, which the UPSCODE
hexagons are intended to replace.
   It is the key to a $1.4 billion program to develop a package
delivery system that uses people for little more than the driver
handing the parcel to its recipient, UPS officials said.
   ``Bar codes, in my opinion, are '80s technology, not '90s
technology,'' said Wesley E. Hughes, who led the team that
developed the new system.
   UPS uses bar codes to keep track of the 700,000 packages it
delivers by air every day. But no such computerized system is in
place to follow the ground-transported packages, which make up the
bulk of UPS's business, said Alan Caminiti, a UPS spokesman.
   An employee must be involved in sorting and distributing
packages through every step of the delivery process.
   Thousands of package handlers line up along conveyor belts at
UPS's 150 U.S. sorting hubs. They must pick up each package, read
its address and send it down the appropriate chute, either to be
piled into UPS's familiar brown delivery truck for its final
destination or sent to another hub for further sorting.
   If a ground delivery package is lost, clerks must dig through
files to determine where it entered the UPS system and whether it
got out - a tedious process at best and a lengthy one at worst.
Air-delivered packages are a little easier to trace, as the bar
code labels allow workers to scan a tracking number into a computer
that can perform an electronic search.
   But both systems require people, and UPS faces a shrinking pool
of young and educated workers who can swiftly read and sort
packages. More than 45 percent of the company's 244,000 employees
are part-time package loaders and sorters, many of them college
students, Caminiti said.
   UPS delivered 2.8 billion packages last year and expects that
number to grow steadily in the coming decade. The only way the
company can keep up with that pace, Hughes said, is to develop
automatic sorters, robotics and computerized tracking systems.
   ``Without some type of automation, we literally are concerned
that we'd run out of people to . . . process our packages in the
time frame that we need to get them processed,'' Hughes said.
   UPS researchers developed and patented UPSCODE after they found
bar codes couldn't pack enough information to meet their needs.
UPSCODE's hexagon pattern can be translated into names, addresses,
tracking numbers and any other information.
   As a UPSCODE-imprinted package rolls along a conveyor belts at
slightly more than 5{ mph, a specially made camera finds, reads and
interprets the code in less than a second. Without the label,
packages crawl past human sorters at a tenth of the speed so the
workers can read the labels.
   With UPSCODE and a fully automated sorting system, the conveyor
belts can be revved up to allow 5,000 packages an hour to get
through, rather than the current 2,000 to 3,000, Hughes said.
   UPSCODE will first be used for air-delivered packages next
spring, Caminiti said. Widespread use isn't likely to start until
1992, when UPSCODE will be used to help UPS track every package in
its system, Hughes said.
   Bar coding will soon be used by the U.S. Postal Service to sort,
distribute and trace its daily deluge of 2.3 million packages, said
Peter A. Jacobson, assistant postmaster for engineering.
   He said the Postal Service wouldn't be interested in using a
dense-code system like UPSCODE, because its scanners and readers
would be too costly.
   ``The more exotic the code, the more investment you need to
make,'' Jacobson said.
   UPSCODE could be used in other industries besides packge
delivery, if the company decides to sell it commercially, Hughes
said.
   Warehouses, which need to keep tight inventory control, could
use a system like UPSCODE, he said.

   The wealthy are getting a dose of what many
Americans already know: rougher economic times.
   Forbes reported Monday that the nation's 400 richest individuals
suffered a decline in net worth this year for the first time since
the magazine began compiling the list eight years ago.
   Fifty-three of the Forbes 400 list lost anywhere from $100
million to $880 million, the magazine said in its Oct. 22 edition.
The minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking, which had
risen steadily from 1982 to 1989, dropped from $275 million last
year to $260 million this year.
   Some names such as casino monger Donald J. Trump were evicted,
another symbolic boot to the 1980s era of living on borrowed money.
Forbes said Trump's fortune, estimated at $1.7 billion in 1989, was
possibly within ``hailing distance of zero'' because of looming
loans and a slow economy.
   Trump, who previously has denounced Forbes for downgrading his
ranking on the list, did not return a telephone call for comment.
   ``It's not just the year Donald Trump's and some other
overleveraged fortunes hit the wall,'' the magazine said. ``This
year the entire Forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and, on
balance, start going down.''
   ``This year all kinds of things went down: real estate, media,
banks, public stocks, private companies, you name it,'' Forbes
said.
   It said the declines ``reflected a general scaling down of
capital values, brought about in good part by a worldwide shrinkage
of credit and sinking stock markets.''
   That's not to say the wealthiest are hurting unbearably. The
estimated worth of the Forbes 400 totals $272.5 billion. That's
actually up $3.5 billion over last year's total, but the magazine
said the reason was its discovery of previously hidden sources of
wealth among some members of the list.
   Forty-three names were added to the list this year, meaning 43
old names came off. Six died, including the magazine's own namesake
Malcolm Forbes. The fortunes of 35 fell too far to be included.
   In addition, Alfred Dreyfus Goldman, Oklahoma City, with a 1989
real estate fortune estimated at $400 million, was removed from the
list because of an inheritance dispute with his brother. William
Barron Hilton was dropped because part of his 1989 total of $1.25
billion actually belongs to a foundation.
   As in 1989, the richest person on the list was John Werner
Kluge, 76, thrice-married entertainment entrepreneur who made his
$5.6 billion fortune by building up Metromedia Co., a wide-ranging
telecommunications company.
   No. 2 is Omaha investor Warren Buffett, 60, who bought his first
stock at age 11 and parlayed a savvy for picking stocks into a $3.3
billion fortune.
   Third is debt-financed takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman,
47, a Wharton business school alumnus who borrowed money to build
an empire that ranges from the Revlon cosmetics company to Coleman
camping products to savings &amp; loans. Forbes pegged his worth at
$2.87 billion.
   More notable, however, were the people whose net worth tumbled.
The biggest victim was Sumner Murray Redstone, owner of the
entertainment giant Viacom International Inc., whose fortune
dropped from $2.88 billion to $2 billion.
   Others in the big-loser category included
publishing-entertainment baron Rupert Murdoch, whose fortune fell
by $600 million to $1.1 billion; cable TV mogul Ted Turner, whose
worth fell $460 million to $1.3 billion; and convicted Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond pioneer Milken, whose worth plunged
by $570 million to $700 million, largely because of $600 million in
criminal penalties and losses from Drexel's collapse early this
year.
   Among new names on the list, the wealthiest was Fred A. Lennon,
a highly secretive Ohio industrialist who made his $600 million
fortune selling valves and pipe fittings.
   The magazine said it based the figures on intensive research
into inheritances, stock ownership and what it called conservative,
common-sense estimates.
   Forbes has sought to make the 400 ranking its trademark, much
like arch-rival Fortune magazine has done with its annual ranking
of the 500 biggest U.S. industrial companies.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell slightly against the Japanese
yen today while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased early
gains and fell.
   The dollar closed at 129.95 yen, down 0.10 yen from Monday, for
its lowest finish since March 15, 1989. The dollar has fallen 7.20
yen since Oct. 1.
   The dollar fell sharply in early trading but bounced back up
before midday following calls from the Bank of Japan to major
banks, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co. The central bank uses such calls to dissuade banks
from too much buying or selling of dollars.
   The dollar also was supported later by reports of final U.S.
Senate approval for a $500 billion deficit-reduction plan, said
Yoshikazu Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Kuroda said, however, the positive effect of the deficit plan's
passage could last only temporarily. ``With prospects of the U.S.
economy getting so bad, even the positive news is not influential
enough to reverse the dollar's downtrend,'' he said.
   Expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would lower interest
rates to stimulate the U.S. economy also are depressing the dollar,
dealers said.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei index lost 134.89
points, or 0.57 percent, closing at 23,495.11.
   The index was off about 550 points from the day's high before
recovering. Traders said investors were discouraged by the slowdown
in the yen's surge against the dollar and a subsequent slip in bond
prices.
   Some traders contend the market is slowly recovering from a
series of big losses accelerated by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. The index fell almost to 20,000 points last week, bringing
its decline since the beginning of this year to about 50 percent.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 83.48 points, down from
Monday's 83.54. Their yield rose to 8.035 percent from 8.020.
   Japanese financial markets will be closed Wednesday for a
national holiday.

   The U.S. dollar declined in moderate trading early
today amid conflicting interpretations of the budgetary debate in
the United States.
   Gold prices climbed slightly.
   Steve Barrow, a currency analyst at Chemical Bank in London,
said the U.S. budget package cobbled together overnight would not
be considered credible because it failed to specify cuts in some
areas.
   In Frankfurt, dealers said the budget package was interpreted as
a sign that the U.S. administration was not committed to deficit
reduction.
   Barrow said the expectations of lower U.S. interest rates will
remain and probably push the dollar lower in the short term.
   Despite suggestions during Tokyo trading that the Bank of Japan
might be prepared to intervene to slow the dollar's slide, dealers
said they doubted major central banks would be prepared to
coordinate dollar purchases.
   Some speculate that the U.S. government would like a lower
dollar to help ease monetary pressure on the economy and reduce the
country's trade gap.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 129.95 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at the same rate.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9765, compared
with $1.9745 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe, compared with late
Monday's rates included: 1.5250 German marks, down from 1.5355;
1.2765 Swiss francs, down from 1.2840; 5.1062 French francs, down
from 5.1400; 1.7200 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7315; 1,143.00
Italian lire, down from 1,150.75, and 1.1500 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1515
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$395.45 per ounce at midmorning, up from $392.45 bid per ounce late
Monday. In Zurich, the bid price was $395.25, up from $391.80.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.68 to close at a bid
$394.37.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.69 a troy ounce, up
from Monday's $4.67.

<TEXT>
   Congress has voted to raise the government's
debt ceiling yet again, this time to $3,195,000,000,000. But it
won't be the last time.
   The $72 billion increase is only enough to carry the government
through Oct. 20.
   By that date, Congress and President Bush are expected to have
agreed on a way to reduce the budget deficit. Then, the
administration will ask that the debt ceiling be raised once again
- to $3.444 trillion, or enough to last through next Sept. 30.
   That will mark the 23rd increase of the Reagan-Bush era.
   The House approved the $3195-trillion figure Monday as part of
a bill renewing federal spending authority while deficit-reduction
efforts continue. The Senate did the same later in the day, as part
of an emergency spending bill.
   Without the additional borrowing authority, the Treasury
Department could not sell the securities necessary to obtain cash
to pay for goods and services already purchased on credit and the
government could not pay its bills.
   The debt limit was $935 billion when President Reagan took
office in January 1981. One of the first pieces of legislation he
signed raised the ceiling by $50 billion. Seven months later the
ceiling rose by an additional $80 billion.
   By the time President Bush took office in 1989, the figure had
soared to $2.8 trillion.

   Thousands of prospective buyers have
signed up to bid for Exxon Corp.'s massive store of surplus oil
spill clean-up gear at a three-day auction beginning today.
   On the block the first day are a seaplane, 38 mobile homes near
Valdez, brand-new fishing nets, and assorted tools, boats and
motors, among other items, said Rob Mackay, spokesman for Ritchie
Bros. Auctioneers International.
   The company put together more than 4,800 lots of excess gear it
bought from Exxon last month for an undisclosed amount.
   ``The amount of interest has been enormous. It's the largest
number of people we've ever had at an auction sale,'' said Mackay.
The Vancouver, British Columbia, auction company conducts more than
70 large auctions annually.
   Ritchie Bros. earlier had predicted that about 5,000 people
would register as potential bidders and that the auction would
bring in more than $10 million.
   Seven thousand people had signed up by today and Mackay said he
couldn't estimate how much more money the auction might with the
higher number of bidders.
   The merchandise is part of 33,000 tons of material moved to
Anchorge last fall for storage after the summer oil-spill cleanup
effort, said Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik.
   The Exxon Valdez tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in March 1989 in the
nation's biggest oil spill. Exxon crews worked to mop up shorelines
that summer and this one, and plan to return for a shoreline survey
next spring.
   Rodvik said the company is keeping enough equipment to conduct
whatever additional cleanup is necessary. Specialized oil-spill
equipment like skimmers and booms aren't being sold.
   The auction has drawn potential bidders from as far away as
Florida and Hawaii, said Mackay. More bidders can sign up over the
next three days.
   ``It's everybody from the guy that lives next door to you to
dealers to contractors to fishermen,'' he said.
   Among the items for sale are 20,000 rubber gloves; 50 portable
toilets; hundreds of washers, dryers, refrigerators, mattresses and
desks; 10 cars; dozens of television sets; thousands of sheets and
blankets; hundreds of hard hats; dozens of bottles of animal
shampoo; scuba gear; two shipping vans full of thongs and deck
shoes; eight fork lifts and a bathtub.
   Thousands of interested buyers have cruised past the three
auction sites in recent days to inspect the merchandise. The
auction will move to a different site each day.
   One Anchorage auctioneer said Alaska bidders probably will lose
many lots to professional bidders who flew in from other states
able to spend millions of dollars.
   ``There will be too many big-buck bidders,'' said Ron Alleva of
Grubstake Realty and Auction Co. ``Anyone from around here will
just be wasting his time.''
   And Dudley Bennish, president of Alaska Mining and Diving Supply
Inc., said he is concerned the auction may depress the market for
awhile. He accused Exxon of breaking a promise not to dump the
goods on the market in Alaska.
   But Bennish said he and other dealers profited when Exxon bought
the equipment in the first place.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The principal owners of the Prudhoe Bay oil
field in Alaska announced today they would invest more than $1
billion to create additional natural gas handling facilities on the
state's North Slope.
   The new facilities are expected to increase the liquids
production in the field by some 100,000 barrels a day starting
1995, the companies said in a statement released in Anchorage,
Alaska.
   The project will increase the field's gas handling ability to an
average of 7.5 billion cubic feet a day, they said.
   The facilities handle natural gas that is extracted from the oil
field along with crude oil.
   The statement said the principal owners of Prudhoe Bay had
resolved a number of issues between oil and gas producers that had
arisen since the original Prudhoe Bay operating agreement.
   The resolution of these issues will allow the development of
projects in the future that would further increase production from
the oil field, the companies said.
   The principal owners of the Prudhoe Bay field are British
Petroleum, Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, Mobil, Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron.

<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co., which owns 13
regional department store chains, said today that it will acquire
the Richmond, Va.,-based Thalhimers chain for $325 million.
   Thalhimers operates 26 stores in Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee and had sales of $445 million in 1989.
   ``The acquisition of Thalhimers represents another important
strategic step for the May Company, strengthening our business with
prestigious, quality department stores,'' said David Farrell,
chairman and chief executive officer of May.
   Like other May acquisitions, Thalhimers will retain its name and
continue to be headquartered in Richmond. The deal is subject to
federal regulatory approval.
   Thirteen of the 26 Thalhimers stores are in Virginia, 10 are in
North Carolina, two are in Charleston, S.C., and one store is
located in Memphis, Tenn. Thalhimers is owned by Carter Hawley Hale
Stores Inc.
   May Department Stores, based in St. Louis, is one of the
nation's leading retailers. It operates 289 department stores in 29
states and the District of Columbia. The company also operates
2,818 Payless ShoeSource discount shoe stores in 44 states.
   Its best-known department store chain is Lord &amp; Taylor.
   Last year the company began what it said was the most aggressive
expansion plan in the retailing industry, allocating $3.7 billion
over five years for the purchase of new stores.

   The stock market opened lower this morning amid
concern over higher oil prices and continual federal budget
problems.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 23.26 points to
2,500.50 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 547 down, 178 up and

   Stocks fell early as oil futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange set new highs above $40 per barrel this
morning.
   ``It's the price of oil,'' said Larry Wachtel, a first vice
president with Prudential-Bache Securities Co. ``That is the
minute-to-minute focus of the market.''
   Wall Street also had its doubts about the temporary budget
agreement today in Washington. Wachtel said it was being viewed as
a ``non-event.''
   President Bush signed emergency legislation to keep the
government open for another 11 days. Bush said, however, there is
``no assurance'' Congress will reach agreement on a $500 billion

   The goverment agreed Tuesday to lift a

   Cigarettes from outside Thailand will be subject to the same

   Black market foreign cigarettes have been widely available in

   Thailand had been under strong pressure from its largest trading

   Late last year, the United States took the dispute to the

<HEAD>Philips Announces 4,900 Layoffs In Computer Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch electronics giant
Philips NV said Tuesday it will lay off 4,900 people in its
computer division as part of a major restructuring aimed at fending
off its Japanese competitors.
   Separately, Philips said it is developing a new cassette player
capable of recording digital sound on ordinary tape, which should
give a boost its consumer electronics division.
   The 4,900 jobs being lost in Philips' information systems
division are part of a restructuring program unveiled this summer
by Philips' new chairman, Jan Timmer, in which up to 10,000 layoffs
ultimately are expected.
   Timmer told shareholders in July that Philips might face a $1
billion loss, which media here blamed largely on disappointing
computer sales.
   The company said in a statement that ``compulsory redundancies
will unavoidable,'' mainly in Europe, as the computer division is
cut to about two thirds its current size of 15,000 people.
   Philips is concentrating on the highly competitive personal
computer market and pulling out of manufacturing and selling more
complex mainframe and microcomputer systems, the announcement said.
   Under the reorganization, many computer division tasks will be
taken over by Philips' consumer electronics unit, which was
successfully pulled out of the red by Timmer before he took over as
company chairman last May.
   That division also is responsible for developing Philips' latest
product, the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) recorder, which will be
available for $500 worldwide in 1992, according to company
spokesman Jan Geel.
   Unlike the digital audio tape recorders introduced in the
mid-1980s by Philips' Japanese competitors, the DCC system won't
need special tape to make high-quality recordings from digital
audio sources like the compact disk, Geel said.
   Sales of the current digital audio tape system have been slow
because the recorders include a device that stops owners from
copying compact disk recordings without paying royalties to the
artists.
   Geel said the DCC recorders would also include ``some kind of
protection to preserve the rights of the artist, but it is not yet
known what form it will take.''
   He said DCC recorders might be fitted with an electronic device
to stop large-scale bootlegging by allowing users to copy compact
disks but not other tape recordings.
   The PolyGram recording firm in London said it was trying to
secure ``an appropriate levy'' on DCC sales to compensate for the
loss of royalties.
   Geel refused to disclose development costs for the DCC project.

<TEXT>
   Zapata Corp. helped make a future president
wealthy.
   But the company founded by George Bush now is struggling to stay
afloat.
   Saddled by about $560 million in debt compounded by
overexpansion, Zapata announced in June a realignment that includes
restructuring some debt and shedding the oil drilling business that
was its foundation.
   The company will maintain its more profitable oil field service
boats and continue in natural gas production and commercial fishing
- divisions that began after Bush left the company 24 years ago.
   The restructuring must be approved by debtholders, and Chairman
R. C. Lassiter has warned that rejection could spell bankruptcy.
   ``The root of our problem is the fact that we built drilling
rigs in the '70s and '80s with the assumption of bringing in
$50,000 a day,'' said company spokesman Barney White.
   In reality, the rigs brought in only about $10,000 to $15,000 a
day, and debts mounted, he said.
   The modern Zapata Off-Shore Co. subsidiary had drilling
operations in Texas as well as California, Singapore, Indonesia,
Abu Dhabi, the Netherlands, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and England.
   Bush started Zapata in Odessa, Texas, in 1953, five years after
he moved to Texas to take a job in the oil patch. The company
became public in 1955. When the Bushes and their five children
later moved to Houston, they took Zapata with them.
   Bush sold his 6 percent stake in Zapata for $1.1 million after
he was elected to Congress in 1966. But his ties to the company
continued through the summer of 1989, when Bush turned 65 and his
pension annuity from the company was paid out. White declined to
reveal the full amount of the annuity.
   ``George made a comfortable amount of money out of it,'' said
former founding partner and retired Pennzoil Corp. Chairman J. Hugh
Liedtke. ``It was a substantial sum, but he's not what in Texas is
called `Big Rich.' ''
   A White House spokesman said Bush would have no comment on the
latest troubles at Zapata.
   Stockholders are expected to vote on Zapata's restructuring plan
this month.
   The planned rig fleet sale should be completed by Oct. 31, but
``if there is not sufficient bondholder acceptance of Zapata's
tender offer, the company will have little alternative but to seek
protection under the bankruptcy laws,'' Lassiter said last month in
the company's latest quarterly report.
   Zapata announced Sept. 5 that it would sell an offshore drilling
rig fleet for $298 million to Arethusa (Offshore) Ltd., a
Bermuda-based consortium of European investors formed for the deal.
   Under the terms of the sale, Zapata will reinvest $17.5 million
in Arethusa, and continue to manage the fleet.
   Of the remaining, $7.7 million would go for commissions on the
sale, $53.6 million would pay off debts specific to the rig fleet,
$160 million would be paid to the banks and about $14.2 million are
in taxes and fees related to the restructuring. About $45 million
would be used as the company's working capital.
   As part of the restructuring, Zapata also will offer to retire
about $78 million in bond debt, White said.
   Zapata lost $20 million, or 63 cents per share, in the three
months ended June 30 on revenue of $39.1 million. During the same
period last year, the company lost $26.1 million, or 82 cents per
share, and had $51.7 million in revenue.
   Asked if the latest rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait might help turn things around, White said, ``It would be
a mistake to jump to the conclusion that the market is going to
turn around.
   ``During the boom (of the early 1980s), everyone bought a
drilling rig to get rich and saturated the markets. Now they, like
us, can't make the payments,'' he said.
   ``We're getting out of drilling business permanently,'' White
said. ``We can't count on Iraq to turn it around. In six months
this will all go away and we'll still have too many rigs.''

   Motorola Inc. said Tuesday increased
orders for its communications and semiconductor products helped
boost earnings nearly 15 percent in the third quarter, but the
company's stock plunged.
   Motorola had plunged $6.75 a share to $53 in heavy trading by
midday on the New York Stock Exchange, a day after the company
announced the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit with
Hitachi Ltd.
   Motorola reported net income of $102 million, or 78 cents per
common share, for the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $89
million, or 69 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Third-quarter sales rose 12 percent to $2.7 billion from $2.4
billion in the third quarter of 1989, Motorola said in a statement
from its Chicago-area headquarters.
   Chairman George Fisher said new orders in the company's major
businesses increased worldwide, with the strongest gains coming
from Asian countries.
   ``Our customers are investing in Motorola products, systems and
services that will improve productivity and efficiency and save
time,'' Fisher said.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Motorola had net income of
$390 million, or $2.98 a share, on sales of $8 billion, compared
with net income of $366 million, or $2.82 a share, on sales of $7
billion for the 1989 period.
   Motorola has refused to give details of the settlement with
Hitachi, which twice had threatened to cut off supplies of key
parts to American computer manufacturers.
   Although terms of the settlement were not disclosed, Motorola
executive James A. Norling said he was pleased.
   ``Our unwavering goals in this legal action were to protect
Motorola's intellectual property and to assure our customers an
uninterrupted supply of Motorola's leadership microprocessors,''
said Norling, president and general manager of the company's
semiconductor products sector.
   Motorola sued Hitachi nearly two years ago in U.S. District
Court in Austin, Texas, accusing the Japanese company of using
certain microprocessor designs patented by Motorola.
   Hitachi countered by accusing Motorola of patent infringement
when the Chicago-area company developed its widely used 68030 chip.
   A federal judge in Texas twice ordered the companies to stop
selling their chips in the United States and to try to work out a
settlement. The orders were stayed in both cases.
   The lawsuits involved Hitachi's H8 and H16 microcontrollers
and Motorola's 68030 and 88000 microprocessors.
   Motorola said the companies will ask the courts to dismiss the
lawsuits.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions
that Monday's gains were overdone, analysts said.
   Soybeans turned mixed after posting gains of as much 17 cents a
bushel in the previous session. Corn and wheat futures also were
narrowly mixed after advacing on Monday.
   Monday's rally was linked in part to worries about rain-related
harvest delays in the Midwest, where farmers are trying to bring in
the soybean and corn crops.
   Traders will get an update on the corn and soybean harvest after
today's close, when the Agriculture Department releases its weekly
crop progress report.
   The government will release revised production estimates for
those crops on Thursday.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.79\ a bushel; corn
was { cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.34\ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to { cent lower with December at $1.23 a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
November at $6.33 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .33 cent higher with October at
79.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .55 cent
higher with October at 88.12 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .68 cent higher with October at 56.60 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .60 cent higher with February
at 64.65 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday; pork futures fell
sharply.

<HEAD>Court To Decide On Investor Deadlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide wat
deadlines investors face when trying to sue over alleged securities
fraud.
   The justices said they will use an Oregon dispute to decide
whether state or federal law should determine the relevant statute
of limitations for such lawsuits.
   The Oregon case began when various investors purchased from 1979
to 1981 units in limited partnerships for the buying and leasing of
computer equipment and computer software.
   Each limited partnership was aimed at generated profits for the
investors, who were limited partners, and to offer them attractive
tax benefits. The deals were put together by a West Orange, N.J.,
law firm - Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow.
   All the limited partnerships were economic failures, but
investors did not investigate the reasons for the poor performance
until 1986 - when the Internal Revenue Service began disallowing
their tax benefits.
   The investors then sued the law firm, charging federal
securities fraud violations.
   At issue is whether an absolute three-year deadline imposed by
the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 should apply. The New
Jersey law firm said it should, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that the deadline should be determined by Oregon
because the suit was filed there.
   Under the federal deadline, the clock would start ticking at the
time of investment.
   The appeals court said Oregon's two-year deadline should apply
from the time the investors were aware, or should have been aware,
that fraud was a possibility.
   The 9th Circuit court, in its ruling earlier this year, told
U.S. District Judge James A. Redden in Portland to reconsider what
date should be used for measuring the start of the state-law time
limit.
   Lawyers for the New Jersey law firm then sought Supreme Court
review, arguing that the federal deadlne - not a state law one -
should apply.
   The case is Lampf Pleva vs. Gilbertson, 90-333.

   The U.S. dollar weakened in European trading today
after a U.S. deficit-reduction accord refocused attention on
prospects of lower U.S. interest rates. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said doubts over the deficit-reduction accord had eased
in recent days but news of the program still raised the probability
of an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
   Despite suggestions during Tokyo trading that the Bank of Japan
might be prepared to intervene to slow the dollar's slide, dealers
said they doubted that major central banks would be prepared to
coordinate dollar purchases.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 129.95 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 130.30 yen. At midday in New
York, the dollar was trading at 130.44 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5245 German marks, down from 1.5355; 1.2765 Swiss

   The average price of self-serve unleaded
gasoline nationwide rose 2.4 cents in the last week to $1.37 per
gallon, the American Automobile Association said Tuesday.
   The average retail price of self-serve unleaded is up 29.5
cents, or 27.4 percent, from Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded
Kuwait and triggered the Middle East crisis.
   The AAA's highest recorded price for self-serve unleaded is
$1.388 per gallon before the Easter weekend in 1981.
   The survey is based on a nationwide spot check of stations
conducted by Computer Petroleum Corp. of St. Paul, Minn. The AAA
said stations continued to report adequate supplies of gasoline.
   Prices rose in all parts of the country, with largest increase
in the West and the smallest in the Midwest, AAA said.
   The nationwide average for self-serve regular leaded gasoiline
rose 1.5 cents to $1.387 per gallon. The average price of
self-serve mid-grade unleaded rose 2.2 cents to $1.45 per gallon
and self-serve premium unleaded gained 2.1 cents to $1.534 per
gallon, AAA said.

before sterling's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism.
   Traders said the market fell prey to worries over hostilities in
the Middle East and the state of the U.S. and British economies.
   The market had been euphoric Monday over the news of the pound's

   ``The market has had its good news,'' one trader said, ``and I

close at 1,132.58.
   Volume was a heavy 823.8 million shares, but down from the

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled retailer Laura Ashley Holdings PLC said
Tuesday its earnings fell 14 percent in the first half of the year
because of poor retailing conditions and a sharp increase in
interest charges.
   The retailer of English country-style women's clothing and
furnishings said its earnings for the six months ended July 28 fell
to 3.6 million pounds, or $6.1 million, from 4.2 million pounds, or
$6.9 million, in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings per share came to 0.02 pence, or 0.03 cent, compared
with 2.09 pence, or 3.4 cents, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 30 percent to 173.9 million pounds, or $296 million,
from 134.2 million pounds, or $221 million.
   The company's results reflected a one-time gain of 3.6 million
pounds, or $6.1 million, from the 4.8 million pound, or $8.2
million, sale of its perfumery Penhaligon's Ltd. to the U.S.
retailer Limited Inc.
   The retailer said its performance in Britain was affected by a
slowdown in both home furnishing and clothing sales, company said.
   The company's continental Europe stores had a more positive
performance, and U.S. sales improved, it said.
   The company said its interest charges more than doubled to 7.03
million pounds, or $12 million, reflecting the surge in British
rates over the past year.
   The firm said it would not pay a half-year dividend.
   Chairman Bernard Ashley said the company's recent cost-cutting
measures ensure it is ``well-placed to withstand the current
trading environment.''
   Last month, the company announced it would sell or close seven
factories in Britain and cut 1,500 jobs.
   The figures announced Tuesday were converted at the
company-provided exchange rates of $1.70 to the pound for the
latest period, and $1.65 for the period a year ago.
   The company did not break out quarterly results. It is not
required to do so under British law.

   The stock market fell broadly today amid
record-high oil prices and persistent federal budget problems.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 38.86 points to
2,484.90 by 2 p.m. EDT.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by almost 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,158 down,

   Volume on the Big Board was 100.24 million shares with two hours

stirring fears of higher inflation.
   ``It's the price of oil,'' said Larry Wachtel, a first vice
president with Prudential-Bache Securities Co. ``That is the
minute-to-minute focus of the market.''
   Wall Street also had doubts about emergency legislation signed
by President Bush to keep the government open for another 11 days.
Bush said, however, there is ``no assurance'' Congress will reach
agreement on a $500 billion deficit reduction package.
   Wachtel said today's development was viewed as a ``non-event.''

   ``The people who had been betting on Motorola were disappointed

<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s board of directors today rejected an
employee buyout bid and said it will proceed with plans to place a
large aircraft order it had postponed at the labor group's request.
   The parent of United Airlines also said it would seek to quickly
reach new contracts with its pilots, machinists and flight
attendants unions, which led the buyout effort.
   The decision represented the fourth failed takeover bid in three
years at UAL.
   UAL made the announcement late this morning after a meeting at
which the board said the employee group failed to arrange financing
for a $201-per-share, $4.38 billion acquisition offer that the
board had accepted in principle in April.
   The board sad in a statement that it rejected a new employee
offer that was ``at an uncertain but substantially lower value than
the April 9 agreement, was not accompanied by definitive financing
arrangements and was subject to other significant contingencies.''
   UAL stock was trading at $93.50 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, up $1.50, following the early afternoon announcement.
   Gerald Greenwald, chief executive officer of the United
Employees Acquisition Corp., had said Sunday that the employees
failed to get bank financing for the $201-a-share bid but had hoped
to make up the shortfall with other features.
   There was no official word on the specifics, but some reports
put the revised bid at $165 to $170 a share, with about $150 of
that in cash and the rest in securities.
   The New York Times, quoting an unidentified source, put it at
about $160 a share, or $3.5 billion. In this version, only about
$70 a share would be in cash. The rest would mostly be in notes
secured by aircraft.
   The buyout group said the cash portion of its revised bid would
come from loans from suppliers; revenue from sale-leaseback
arrangements, in which the company sells equipment such as
airplanes and leases them back; employee investments; and cash on
hand.
   Greenwald said Monday he did not know what the group would do if
the board rejected its restructured offer. He was not immediately
available today.
   All three of the labor groups are working with expired
contracts. The pilots, who have been trying to gain control of the
company for 3{ years, had vowed to confront UAL's management with
everything including a strike if the acquisition attempt failed.
   The directors also could face a movement to oust them by angry
stockholders led by Coniston Partners, a New York investment group
which owns 11.8 percent of UAL shares.
   The employee group asked the board in July to postpone the
aircraft purchase while the future ownership of the corporation was
in the air. UAL had said previously that it expected the order to
be the largest ever placed for wide-body jetliners.

   Soviet citizens probably won't be interested in
buying stocks while grocery stores are empty, Finance Ministry
officials cautioned Tuesday during a Wall Street seminar on
reviving a Soviet stock exchange.
   Worse yet, they may not even have the option. The Soviet central
bank said there were no facilities in this shortage-plagued country
to print share certificates.
   ``Many people can't understand how we can sell securities when
we can't sell them other products'' such as bread and cigarettes,
Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rayevsky said in an interview.
   ``Our Soviet people, our public opinion doesn't know the essence
of a stock exchange,'' he said during the seminar organized by the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Trading in shares has been illegal in the Soviet Union for many
years. The practice was prohibited after the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution, and although it was revived briefly during the 1920s,
trading was banned again in 1928 by Josef Stalin.
   Officials from the New York Stock Exchange are trying to give
would-be marketeers a boost with the three-day seminar, a
crash-course on organizing, running and regulating a stock market.
   But Rayevsky and government spokesman Stanislav Assekritov said
a national public education campaign will be needed to convince
Soviets a stock exchange is needed in a market economy.
   ``What we need to do is change the mindsets of the public,''
said Assekritov, deputy chairman of a government economic reform
committee.
   ``First we shall have to explain to the public that a market of
securities, a stock exchange, will make our shops more plentiful
because the transfer of capital will enable us to change the
structure of our economy.''
   Assekritov said unless that happens, ``even if we set up a stock
exchange in Moscow by a decree of the city (council), people would
ask this question: Why start trading in securities if shelves are
empty?''
   The Soviet economy has been in shambles this year. Consumers
endured shortages of cigarettes, matches and even ice cream this
summer, and bread shelves were empty for the first time since the
1960s. A bleak winter looms ahead, as much of a bumper potato crop
rotted in the fields.
   Dmitri Tulin, managing director of the Gosbank central bank's
new securities department, said one of the biggest concerns in
reviving a stock exchange is the lack of facilities for printing
share certificates that could not be forged. He said there was only
one such plant in the country, but it's working at full capacity
printing rubles and passports.
   ``We either have to build a new plant facility for producing
paper or just leap over this stage and develop a paperless market
from the very beginning,'' he said.
   But few Soviets would accept that, either, he said.
   ``In Central Asia, I could hardly imagine anyone buying
something that they can't put under their mattress,'' Tulin said.
   The myriad of economic rescue plans being considered by the
Soviet government calls for the creation of a stock market, some as
soon as the end of this year.
   Assekritov said the end of 1991 would be more realistic.
   ``We cannot just decree a stock exchange into existence,'' he
told the seminar. ``This is not a museum as some people think,
where exhibits are put on display.''
   Nicholas Rey, managing director of the New York-based brokerage
firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc., said the Soviets need to privatize
state industries gradually before a stock exchange can flourish.
   The government now owns 80 percent to 90 percent of the property
in this vast country and is only slowing moving away from the ban
on private ownership, one of the most sacred precepts of communism.
   ``I would start very simply with (privatizing) the most
profitable enterprises,'' such as the oil industry, said Rey, a
director of the Polish-American committee advising Warsaw on its
privatization program.

<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union leaders today
overwhelmingly recommended ratification of a new three-year
contract with Ford Motor Co.
   ``No one had to get up to try to get people to support this
agreement,'' UAW President Owen Bieber said after the vote by the
union's bargaining council.
   Union Vice President Ernie Lofton, in charge of the union's Ford
Department, said he expects ratification to be completed by Oct.
21.
   The tentative agreement reached early Sunday closely follows a
contract the union reached last month with General Motors Corp.,
which allows the automakers more flexibility but gives workers a
greater degree of job security.
   GM workers ratified the pact by a margin of 4-to-1. About
300,000 GM employees are covered by the UAW contract.
   After the pact is ratified by Ford workers, UAW negotiations
with Chrysler Corp. will accelerate. That bargaining is expected to
be much more difficult than it was at Ford or GM because of
Chrysler's deteriorating financial shape.

   Grains and soybeans were mixed at the close of a

   Soybean futures prices remained in the same range following a

<TEXT>
   China is sending more than 300 government and
business emissaries to the United States on a large-scale shopping
trip to smooth strained trade and political ties, officials said
Tuesday.
   Leaders of the delegation, which sets out Friday for a
three-week visit, said members will be looking to place orders for
products ranging from high-tech equipment to timber and grain.
   ``This is not only a gesture - public relations. We are doing
the actual thing,'' Sun Zhenyu of the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade told a news conference. Sun is deputy director
of the ministry's department for trade with the United States and
Oceania, and will take part in the buying mission.
   The delegation includes representatives from most of China's
major foreign trade companies and other leading state corporations.
   Sun said some purchase orders to be signed on the trip would
have been made anyway, but that the group is genuinely seeking to
find new American sources for products to redress a longstanding
trade imbalance.
   The U.S. Commerce Department says the United States imported
$11.99 billion worth of Chinese goods in 1989, and sold $5.81
billion worth to China. The figures include Chinese products
shipped through Hong Kong.
   China, which does not count the products that go through Hong
Kong, says it sold just $4.4 billion worth of goods to the United
States and bought about $8 billion in return.
   ``We are trying to sort it out with the U.S. Government and find
out why there are different statistics,'' Sun said. But he
acknowledged, ``China's imports from the United States have
dropped, that's a fact, and the Chinese government attaches great
importance to that. We must do something to correct that state of
affairs.''
   American products could be ordered through regular trade
channels, he said, but sending the large delegation will
``demonstrate how eager we are ... And show our wish to restore
relations in all aspects.''
   U.S.-Chinese relations have been strained since June 1989, when
China's ruling Communists ordered the army to attack pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing. The United States condemned the attack
and halted military sales to China, blocked development loans by
international agencies and stopped most high-level exchanges.
   Some U.S. legislators have proposed canceling China's
most-favored nation trade status as a further sanction. The status
subjects Chinese products to the lowest U.S. tariffs.
   Wang Rensheng, a former deputy trade minister who will head the
delegation, said members will seek to meet with congressmen to
press for continued MFN treamment. Proposals to cancel it this year
appear to have lost support, but a bill has been submitted in the
House to link next year's renewal to China's human rights record.
   U.S. imports from China appear largely unaffected by the
political tension. They rose nearly 15 percent in the first eight
months of the year over the same period last year, Chinese
statistics show.
   Chinese imports from the United States dropped about 15 percent
in the same period, however, due partly to a Chinese currency
devaluation and a domestic austerity program.
   The buying trip coincides with a separate, 34-member Chinese
delegation that will be promoting Chinese products in the United
States and Canada.

   Stocks fell sharply today today as record-high
oil prices replaced federal budget problems as the market's focal
point.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 47.77 points to
2,475.99 by 3 p.m. EDT.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,216 down, 309 up
and 418 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was 118.63 million shares with an hour
left to trade.
   Stocks fell from the opening and moved steadily lower as oil
futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange set new highs
above $40 per barrel today, stirring fears of higher inflation.
   Late in afternoon trading, the Dow average was off more than 50
points, triggering the exchange's ``uptick rule'' that limits
program selling by computers.
   The rising oil price was ``the minute-to-minute focus of the
market,'' said Larry Wachtel, a first vice president with
Prudential-Bache Securities Co.
   Wall Streeters also had doubts about emergency legislation
signed by President Bush to keep the government open for another 11
days. Bush said, however, there is ``no assurance'' Congress will
reach agreement on a $500 billion deficit reduction package.
   The most NYSE active stock was Motorola Inc., down 6&lsqb; to 53|
after settling a patent infringement battle with Hitachi Ltd.
   Travelers Corp. fell another 1\ to 13&lsqb; amid continued concern
over its recent losses.
   UAL Corp. was down 4{ to 86} after its board rejected an
employee buyout bid, which became the fourth failed attempt to take

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.07 to 168.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.00 at 303.51.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Turns Down Natural Gas Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court turned away a multibillion-dollar dispute over
natural gas costs but plans to decide what deadlines investors face
when trying to sue over alleged securities fraud.
   Without comment, the court on Tuesday refused to reinstate a
federal regulation to ease a burden on pipeline companies that
signed contracts to buy gas in the 1970s and '80s at a specified
price. The pipelines were required to pay for the gas even if they
couldn't sell it.
   The so-called take-or-pay agreements were signed when the price
of gas was higher than it is today. But natural gas supplies began
to exceed demand by 1982 because of warm winters, a recession and
customers' switching to alternate fuels. As a result, the pipeline
companies were left with billions of dollars in costs for unwanted
gas.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adopted a plan in 1987
allowing the pipelines to charge customers part of the cost. But an
appeals court threw out the plan in December, saying the charges to
pipeline customers amounted to a retroactive change in rates
without advance warning.
   The appeals court said current customers who didn't buy gas from
a pipeline until after 1986 would not have to pay any part of the
liability. The court, which reviewed the problem in a case
involving Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., sent the case back to the
commission for another solution.
   Gas customers in Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky and
Ohio who could face higher gas rates joined the Bush administration
and Tennessee Pipeline in urging the Supreme Court to step in.
   In a separate case, the justices said they will use an Oregon
dispute to decide whether state or federal law should determine the
relevant statute of limitations for securities fraud suits.
   The Oregon case began when investors purchased from 1979 to 1981
limited partnerships, put together by the West Orange, N.J., law
firm Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow and designed to
generate profits and tax benefits.
   Though each was an economic failure, investors did not
investigate the reasons for the poor performance until 1986 - when
the Internal Revenue Service began disallowing their tax benefits.
The investors then sued the law firm, charging federal securities
fraud violations.
   At issue is whether an absolute three-year deadline imposed by
the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 should apply.
   Under the federal deadline, the clock would start ticking at the
time of investment. But an appeals court said Oregon's two-year
deadline should apply from the time the investors were aware, or
should have been aware, that fraud was a possibility.
   The court also revived a $4 billion libel suit in which
millionaire inventor Arthur Jones charged ABC's ``20-20'' program
falsely portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite in a 1987 piece about
the fate of 63 baby elephants he rescued from death in Africa.

<HEAD>Iraq Harvests 3 Million Tons of Grain, Increases Cultivated Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq produced more than 3 million metric
tons of grain in this year's harvest, and plans to produce at least
38 percent more next season to beat United Nations sanctions on
trade, the government newspaper al-Jumhouriya said Tuesday.
   The increase will help Iraq achieve food self-sufficiency in the
face of the U.N. embargo imposed after its Aug. 2 invasion and
subsequent annexation of neighboring Kuwait, al-Jumhouriya said.
   Iraq produced 1.196 million tons of wheat and 1.854 million tons
of barley, the country's main grain staples, in the April harvest,
the paper quoted Ministry of Planning statistics as saying.
   Iraq produces smaller amounts of rice and maize, but the amounts
were not given, nor did the newspaper indicate what last year's
harvests were.
   The land area cultivated for wheat and barley for this year's
harvest was 3.451 million hectares, about 8.5 million acres, but is
expected to increase to 4.783 million hectares, about 11.8 million
acres, for next season, the ministry said.
   President Saddam Hussein and officials of the planning and
agriculture ministries have exhorted farmers to increase
cultivation of cereals in recent weeks.
   The government hopes to raise the land area devoted to such
crops to 8 million hectares, or 20 million acres in the coming
years, and thus achieve food self-sufficiency, according to sources
in Baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Tuesday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.19 percent, up from 7.18 percent
last week. Another $9.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.21 percent, unchanged from last week.
   The rates for the three-month bills were the highest since they
sold for 7.32 percent on Sept. 24.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.42 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,818.30 and 7.59 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,635.50.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.58
percent last week, down from 7.79 percent the previous week.

   Commercial health insurance companies spend 14
times as much as the federal Medicare program does on
administration, overhead and marketing, a private group said
Tuesday.
   And the private insurance sector spent 11 times as much per
dollar of claims paid as the Canadian national health care system,
according to a report by the group, Citizen Action.
   If the private health insurance industry were as efficient as
Medicare, about $13 billion could be saved and used to provide
insurance to 11 million uninsured people, the group's study found.
   ``Competition in the insurance market is wasteful and
expensive,'' said Robert Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action.
``In health care, a free market cannot work. What we need is a
single-payer system, where the government is the sole insurer.''
   The Health Insurance Association of America said Citizen
Action's study was misleading because it did not include Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans or plans sponsored by large, self-insured
companies. When these are factored in, the 1988 administrative
costs in the commercial sector drop to 13 cents for each dollar of
benefits paid, the association said in a statement.
   The association also said that private insurers are spending an
increasing amount of money to make sure doctors' and hospitals'
bills are appropriate. This effort saves billions of dollars
annually, the association said.
   The association also said Citizen Action was misguided in its
call for a government-run health insurance program. Noting the
budget disagreement that shut down the federal government over the
weekend, the insurers said that ``most logical observers ... would
not be inspired with confidence by the efficiency of government-run
programs.''
   Medicare helps pay doctors' and hospital bills for the nation's
33 million elderly and disabled citizens. Medicaid is a
federal-state program that provides medical services to the poor.
An estimated 37 million Americans have no health insurance, public
or private.
   Citizen Action's report showed that in 1988 commercial health
insurance companies spent 33.5 cents on administration, marketing,
commissions and other overhead expenses for every dollar in claims
paid out.
   By comparison, Medicare's administrative costs were 2.3 cents
per dollar in claims paid out. In the Canadian health care system,
administrative costs amounted to about 3 cents per dollar in claims
paid, the group said.
   Private insurance companies, in their efforts to compete for
more business, spend money on things that are not necessary when
coverage is provided by a single public program, the group said.
   One of these functions is the internal review required to deny
claims.
   ``Incredibly, the commercial insurance way of paying for health
care leaves Americans spending more to deny people coverage than it
would cost to provide everyone with coverage,'' the report said.
   Citizen Action is a nonprofit, consumers rights group with
affiliates in 30 states.

<HEAD>Membership Cards Replace Coupons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family-owned supermarket chain is
offering its customers a way to save without the age-old bother of
coupon clipping.
   In a word: plastic.
   Big Y Foods Inc., began its Express Savings Club on Monday.
Customers will receive a plastic membership card which will be
scanned at the checkout counter for discounts and specials being
offered that day.
   ``We don't have to print as many coupons; people don't have to
bring them in, and we don't have to count them,'' said Claire
D'Amour, vice president of marketing for Big Y Foods Inc. ``There
is a lot of savings in the whole system because paperwork is
diminished.''
   The cards, which anyone can apply for and receive immediately at
any Big Y store, will have to be presented to the cashier before a
shopper checks out. When passed over the store's scanning
equipment, the bar code on the back of the card will identify the
customer by number and automatically discount items the customer
has selected on which Big Y and its vendors are offering savings.
   People who bring in paper coupons will get double the value of
the discount. But by using the card, shoppers can get a discount on
up to five of the featured items, instead of the regular one
coupon, one item rule.
   Cost-cutting is essential to the supermarket industry, which
operates on extremely tight margins. Net profit industry wide is
less than a penny on every $1, according to the Food Marketing
Institute.
   The cards give the store a better way to know their customers,
D'Amour said.
   ``Once a customer is identified by number and you have data on
them ... there is a lot of...marketing potential,'' she said.
   ``We ultimately hope to be better, smarter retailers. This kind
of electronic marketing is for the '90s,'' she said.
   ``They all fall under the term of `frequent shopper program,' to
track what an individual is purchasing and give them a reward for
volume and loyalty. It is something the industry is looking at
carefully and will become more common.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly lower on world
markets Tuesday, but selloffs in other currencies prevented its
decline from deepening.
   Gold prices tumbled after rising overseas. On the New York
Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell $5.20 to
settle at $389.70 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank in New York
quoted a late bid for gold at $390.75, down $4.25 an ounce from
late Monday.
   The dollar fell sharply in Asian dealings, hitting new lows
against the German mark and 18-month lows against Japanese yen
before consolidating and recovering slightly when trading shifted
to Europe and the United States, said Marc Chandler, an analyst
with the consulting firm IDEA.
   Traders cashed in on the weekend runup in the British pound and
the yen, and their profit-taking prevented the dollar from
relinquishing further ground.
   ``Given the extended moves . . . in sterling and the yen, there
was more cross-related trading today,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief
dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Dealers expressed disappointment about lawmakers' extended
haggling over a deficit-reduction package and complained about a
seeming lack of commitment to resolve the budget problem. President
Bush signed a temporary spending bill that keeps the government
operating until Oct. 19 while Congress tries to come up with a
budget accord.
   ``It's still not a sure thing,'' Chandler said.
   Any accord raises the possibility that the Federal Reserve would
ease interest rates. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated
securities more attractive to investors, thereby increasing their
need to hold the U.S. currency.
   Traders said the outlook for the dollar remains bearish ``given
the problems with the budget as well as the economics we've seen
with a recession scenario building here,'' Holzer said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 129.95 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted higher at 130.30 yen. In New York,
the dollar settled at 130.25 yen, down from 130.48 yen on Monday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9705, compared
with $1.9745 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.9730 to buy one
pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.9760.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5238 German marks, down from 1.5323; 1.2735 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2800; 5.1015 French francs, down from 5.1300;
1,142.25 Italian lire, down from 1,151.50, and 1.1506 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1514.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5245 German marks, down from 1.5355; 1.2765 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2840; 5.1005 French francs, down from 5.1400;
1.7185 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7315; 1,143.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,150.75, and 1.1507 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1515.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $396.25 per ounce, up
from $392.45 bid per ounce late Monday. In Zurich, the late bid
price was $395.50, up from $391.80 late Monday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold rose $5.68 to close at a bid $394.37.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.593 a troy ounce, down from
Monday's $4.670. But in London the metal rose to a late bid price
of $4.68 an ounce from $4.67.

<HEAD>Slumping Winnebago Offers Gasoline Rebates to New Customers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnebago Industries Inc. on Tuesday
offered a year's rebate on gasoline to buyers of recreational
vehicles, in an attempt to break out of a sale slump aggravated by
soaring prices at the pump.
   The Forest City, Iowa, motor home manufacturer is in the midst
of a factory shutdown that's idled 1,500 employees, and has had
four straight quarterly losses.
   The promotional program is aimed at holding down fuel costs to
under $1 a gallon for motor homes sold through the end of the year
at participating dealers.
   ``We are in effect rolling back gasoline prices to 99.9 cents
per gallon, the price of gasoline prior to the current Mideast
crisis,'' said Winnebago's sales director, J. Ronald Hanna.
   ``Our potential customers are concerned about rising gasoline
prices due to the Mideast turmoil and economic uncertainty,'' Hanna
said. ``By guaranteeing the price of gasoline, we will help relieve
those concerns.''
   Securities analyst Frank Rolfes, who follows Winnebago for Dain
Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis, said the sales incentive is worth a
try.
   ``They can't just sit there and not sell anything,'' Rolfes
said.
   ``I know their sales have been very, very weak,'' he said. ``The
last time I talked to them things were pretty grim.''
   Winnebago reported a net loss of $14 million for the nine months
ended May 26, compared with net income of $6.6 million in the same
period a year earlier. Fourth-quarter and yearly results are
expected sometime this month.
   Inventories of unsold Winnebago and Itasca models are so high
that the Winnebago factory was shut down Oct. 1 and is not
scheduled to reopen until Monday, said spokeswoman Shiela Davis.
   Winnebago said it will issue a gasoline rebate coupon book when
a customer purchases a new Winnebago or Itasca motor home. The
rebates will be based in part on mileage allowances set by
Winnebago of either 8 miles per gallon for large models and 15
miles per gallon for smaller motor homes.
   The price used in determining the rebate will be the average
national price for self-service regular unleaded gasoline published
the first week of each month by the Oil and Gas Journal magazine, a
petroleum industry trade publication.
   The rebates will be good for 12 months or 12,000 miles,
whichever comes first.
   Under the offer, the motor home owner brings in his vehicle to a
dealership every three months or 4,000 miles to have the mileage
verified and the rebate coupon notarized.
   Ms. Davis said the company has no estimate on how much the
rebates will cost because there is no way of knowing what will
happen to gas prices or how successful the incentives will be.

<HEAD>Union Talks Move to Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the focus of auto union talks
shifting to Chrysler Corp., Chairman Lee Iacocca plans to argue
that his company can't afford to be as generous with its workers as
Ford and GM.
   But United Auto Workers union officials said Tuesday his
pleadings will fall on deaf ears.
   ``Anytime he (Iacocca) makes as much as he has in the last five
years, it's pretty hard for him to plead poverty,'' said UAW Vice
President Stan Marshall said. Iacocca earned more than $6.4 million
since 1985 in salary and bonuses. Stock options have added millions
more.
   But Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said: ``He (Iacocca) is going
to explain we have specific needs and we want to talk to the union
about it.''
   In another deelopment, Canadian Auto Workers union officials
said there has been progress in talks with General Motors of
Canada, Ltd., but said talks would likely go ``right down to the
wire'' to meet a strike deadline set for midnight Wednesday.
   The UAW reached a tentative agreement with Ford on Sunday.
Voting will be completed Oct. 21. GM workers ratified their
agreement last month by a 4-1 margin.
   The three-year pacts with Ford and General Motors provide, among
other things, income guarantees for workers laid off due to sales
reductions, penalties of up to $5 an hour for scheduling excessive
overtime and a 3 percent raise in base wages during the first year
coupled with 3 percent lump-sum payments in the second and third
years of the contract.
   Perhaps most onerous to Chrysler is what's absent from the
pattern agreements with Ford and GM: changes in health-care
provisions.
   From the first day of bargaining in mid-July, Chrysler officials
have said they need relief from soaring medical care costs, which
reached about $684 million in 1989.
   The company proposed a multi-employer health care program to cut
costs, but the UAW's Marshall said that suggestion is all but dead.
   ``The company could be in much better shape if those (Chrysler)
executives would stop running around with all that money,'' said
Marshall, who heads the union's Chrysler bargaining team.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said he would not be at a scheduled
meeting Thursday with Iacocca, but ``I'm sure all the union people
there will reply appropriately.''
   Bieber said he would enter the Chrysler talks expecting a
settlement rather than a strike. ``I'm not packing a six-gun when I
get there,'' he said.
   At the end of August, the latest figure available from the
union, the UAW had $770 million in its strike fund.
   Chrysler executives have said the GM and Ford contracts, which
are nearly identical, would be extremely expensive for Chrysler.
That doesn't faze Marshall or other members of the UAW's Chrysler
negotiating team.
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' said Tony De Francesco, a shop
committeeman from UAW Local 624 in Syracuse, N.Y., and a member of
the team. ``They will follow pattern.''

Project</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aircraft Engines,
sometimes fierce competitors in the jet engine industry, will join
together to study the possibility of developing a new propulsion
system for supersonic commercial aircraft, the companies announced
Tuesday.
   Depending on the results of the initial study, the companies
will then decide how to divide responsibilities in developing the
system.
   The companies said the uncommon alliance is a matter of
necessity if either is to participate in developing a futuristic
system capable of propelling a civilian aircraft at speeds up to 3{
times the speed of sound.
   ``We recognize neither company could realistically embark on
this project alone,'' Arthur E. Wegner, president of Pratt &amp;
Whitney, said in a statement.
   ``By working together, we will greatly increase the prospects of
resolving the enormous technical issues, while also evaluating
methods to address the significant business issues associated with
developing a supersonic transport engine,'' Wegner said.
   The companies plan to form a ``joint strategy board,'' with
Pratt and GE assigning senior officers to serve as program managers
leading each company's activities, the statement said.
   GE Aircraft, based in Evendale, Ohio, is a division of the
General Electric Co. East Hartford-based Pratt and Whitney is a
unit of United Technologies Corp.
   Tuesday's announcement comes less than six months after GE sued
Pratt &amp; Whitney for $1.15 billion after a German aerospace company,
Motoren und Turbinen Union, withdrew from participation in GE's
development of a new turbofan engine to compete with Pratt's
PW4000.
   The suit was dropped after MTU agreed to continue consulting
with GE on smaller engines only.

<HEAD>Argentine Government Sale of State Phone Company Hits Snag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has set a new date
to sell the state phone company ENTel, following a snag that
delayed the $5.5 billion deal last week.
   The Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones is now due to be
privatized Nov. 8. The privatization was to take place on Monday,
but a U.S.-led group of investors dropped out at the last minute,
and a European group that stepped in needed time to review the
contract.
   Obstacles that remain include setting phone rates, which will be
linked to the cost of living after privatization.
   The U.S. group of Manufacturers Hanover, and Bell Atlantic
Corp., dropped out last Thursday when it could not meet the
deadline to sign the contracts because it lacked $2.3 billion worth
of debt papers.
   The government is offering to sell 60 percent of ENTel for $214
million cash, $5 billion in debt papers, and $380 million in
deferred payments.
   The government is selling ENTel because it loses money, and
President Carlos Menem is shifting the Argentine economy away from
state control.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, will ask the panel to accept President Bush's
capital gains tax cut and increase income tax rates on wealthier
Americans, aides said Tuesday.
   Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, endorsed those tax changes as part of
a deficit-reduction plan the committee will begin working on
Wednesday.
   Disclosure of Bentsen's position on capital gains - he had been
opposing a cut - came a few hours after Bush said he would accept
higher tax rates on the rich in exchange for the capital gains
reduction.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who leads the House Ways and
Means Committee, has not disclosed whether he will support the
capital gains cut.
   Bentsen's package follows in considerable detail the plan worked
out over five months by the White House and congressional leaders.
But it eliminates some provisions that had been especially
distasteful to many lawmakers.
   His proposal, which envisions tax increases of up to $150
billion over five years, would:
   - Avoid increasing Medicare premiums.
   - Drop a proposed 2 cent-a-gallon tax on refined petroleum
products, including home-heating oil and gasoline.
   - Cut from 10 cents to 9 cents the increase in the 9 cent
gasoline tax.
   - Drop $12 billion worth of tax incentives for small
corporations, wich had been attacked as a new system of tax
shelters for the rich.
   Bentsen's plan retains: a 10 percent tax on part of the price of
expensive cars, furs, jewelry and boats; an 8 cent boost in the tax
on cigarettes and similar increases on other tobaccco products;
doubling of the beer tax to 32 cents a six-pack; raising of the
wine tax - from 3 cents per fifth to 25 cents for table wine, for
example; and raising the liquor tax by $1.50 a gallon to $14.
   Bentsen also proposed to raise from $51,300 to about $85,000 the
maximum annual wage to which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies.
That tax is withheld from paychecks as part of the Social Security
tax.
   Senate aides said preliminary estimates indicate Bentsen's
proposal would be considerably fairer to low- and middle-income
taxpayers than the bipartisan plan written by congressional leaders
and the White House.
   Complaints that the bipartisan plan was overly generous to
upper-income people were a major factor in its defeat by the House
last weekend.
   In past years, Bentsen had endorsed taxing capital gains - which
are profits from the sale of investments - at lower rates than
apply to wages. But he has opposed such a change recently because
most of the benefit would go to those who make more than $100,000 a
year.
   The fight between Democrats and Republicans over capital gains
has been a major impediment to a deficit-reduction plan this year.
   Bentsen's plan would exclude from taxation 30 percent of the
profit from the sale of an asset held three years or longer. A 20
percent exclusion would be given to two-year property, and a 10
percent exclusion to one-year property.
   The plan also would eliminate a quirk in tax law that allows the
600,000 wealthiest Americans to pay a maximum tax rate of 28
percent, even though people making slightly less pay a top rate of
33 percent. Under the proposal, those in the wealthiest category
would pay the higher rate.
   The combination of the capital gains exclusion and the 33
percent rate would result in a top effective capital gains rate of
23.1 percent.
   In addition, the plan would raise the individual alternative
minimum tax rate, now 21 percent, to 25 percent. This tax is paid
by about 150,000 people with incomes who, by using legal
deductions, are able to reduce their tax liability to near zero.
They are required to give back some of their deductions and pay the
minimum tax if it is higher than their regular income tax.

<HEAD>Purchaser of Thalhimers Chain Promises No Major Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. has agreed to buy
the Virginia-based Thalhimers department store chain from
struggling Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. for $325 million, the
companies announced Tuesday.
   The transaction brings to 14 the number of regional department
store chains owned by May, and it will allow Carter Hawley, which
announced another quarterly loss on Tuesday, to reduce its debt and
concentrate on its four West Coast-based department store chains.
   Thalhimers, which had sales of $445 million in 1989, operates 13
stores in Virginia, including eight in the Richmond area; 10 in
North Carolina, two in Charleston, S.C., and one in Memphis, Tenn.
   May President Thomas A. Hays told a news conference there were
no plans to close Thalhimers' downtown Richmond store, and no other
major changes were planned at any of the branches. The stores will
continue to operate under the same name and same management, Hays
said.
   St. Louis-based May also owns Washington, D.C.-based Hecht's
stores, which compete with Thalhimers in several locations. Hays
said that rivalry will continue.
   ``Each one will report to a separate vice chairman,'' Hays said.
``They'll have different promotions and different merchandise,
although there will be a little crossover.''
   Hays said May owns competing stores in other markets as well.
   May's other divisions include Lord &amp; Taylor, Filene's, Foley's,
May Co., L.S. Ayres, and Kaufmann's department stores. It also owns
Venture discount stores and Payless ShoeSource stores. May's 1989
sales totaled $9.4 billion.
   Carter Hawley has been struggling with slumping sales in recent
years.
   The company announced Tuesday it had lost $25.5 million, or 92
cents a share, in its fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 4, compared
with a loss of $8.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier.
   The retailer said its results reflected $6 million in expenses
resulting from last year's earthquake in Northern California.
   Sales in the quarter were $633.3 million, up from $624.6 million
for last year's fourth quarter.
   For the full fiscal year, Carter Hawley reported a loss of
nearly $26 million, or $1.03 a share, compared with a profit of
$13.5 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The full-year results reflected a $16.5 million charge related
to the earthquake, the company said.
   Full-year sales totaled $2.86 billion, compared with $2.79
billion in 1989.
   Carter Hawley's divisions include Broadway, Thalhimers and
Weinstocks department stores.

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. shareholders on Tuesday
rejected a resolution that urged the company to stop buying coffee
from El Salvador until that nation ends its civil war.
   More than 97 percent of stockholders at the company's annual
meeting voted against the resolution, with 2.6 percent in favor.
   James Gamble of Amherst, Mass., great-great grandson of the
company's co-founder, and shareholder Patricia Close of Seattle had
co-sponsored the resolution.
   P&amp;G's board of directors had recommended shareholders reject the
proposal. The maker of Folgers coffee refuses to say how much
Salvadoran coffee it buys annually, but says the amount is less
than 2 percent. P&amp;G buys coffee from 30 countries.
   Also Tuesday, P&amp;G directors raised the annual dividend on common
stock from $1.80 to $2. They approved a 50 cent dividend payable on
Nov. 15.
   P&amp;G stock fell $1.25 a share to $78.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday.
   P&amp;G's board said the U.S. government has urged trade with the
American-backed Salvadoran government. The board also said P&amp;G
should not be drawn into a dispute between Washington and critics
of the Bush administration's foreign policy.
   Edwin L. Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman and chief executive, read letters
Tuesday from President Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, and
Roman Catholic Bishop Romeo Tovar Astorga, president of the
Catholic Conference of Bishops of El Salvador, supporting continued
purchases of Salvadoran coffee.
   Artzt said P&amp;G agrees with Astorga's contention that a boycott
of Salvadoran coffee would hurt peasant farmers and laborers on
coffee plantations.
   Artzt called the resolution and its supporters misguided.
   ``These people are obviously sincere in their thinking,'' Artzt
said. ``You can be sincere and misguided at the same time.''
   Gamble and his supporters said purchases of Salvadoran coffee
provide money for wealthy, plantation-owning families who back El
Salvador's war and may condone murder and torture of political
opponents.
   Gamble and the Rev. Benjamin Urmston, a Jesuit priest, told the
shareholders Tuesday that P&amp;G's purchases of Salvadoran coffee
could have indirectly helped arm the assassins who murdered six
Jesuit priests in El Salvador last year.
   ``By buying Salvadoran coffee, Procter &amp; Gamble helped buy the
rifles to murder those priests,'' Gamble said.
   Gamble, 27, owner of 24,806 shares of P&amp;G common stock, said his
resolution had the support of his brother, Robert Gamble, 30, and
their father, Walter.
   James Gamble said he was disappointed the resolution failed to
muster the minimum 3 percent of shares voted that would have
allowed him to bring it up again for a vote at the next shareholder
meeting.
   ``We respect the results of the vote,'' James Gamble said.
   Shareholders also rejected, on recommendation of the company, a
proposal that urged P&amp;G to end remaining economic relationships
with South Africa in protest of that country's apartheid system of
racial separation.
   P&amp;G said it has had no operations or employees in South Africa
since selling a Richardson-Vicks subsidiary there in 1986.
   But P&amp;G said it collects royalty payments of $500,000 annually
for use of its trademarks in South Africa. Artzt said that
abandoning those trademarks would hurt shareholders without
improving the plight of South Africa's black residents.
   Seven animal-rights activists were arrested Tuesday, six outside
the shareholders' meeting and one for interrupting the meeting. The
activists and several shareholders urged P&amp;G to end its use of
animals in product safety testing.
   Artzt said P&amp;G is reducing its use of animals in testing, but
will not end the practice until alternatives are available to
ensure consumer safety for all P&amp;G products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had $24.1 billion in worldwide sales during the
fiscal year that ended June 30.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Waver on Fear of Soviet Selling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices declined sharply Tuesday on New
York's Commodity Exchange amid soaring energy prices and fears of a
massive Soviet gold sell-off, analysts said.
   On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans were mixed; meat
and livestock futures were slightly higher; and energy futures rose
sharply.
   Gold settled $4.80 to $5.30 lower with the contract for delivery
in October at $389.70 a troy ounce. Silver settled 7.7 cents to 8.5
cents lower with October at $4.593 an ounce.
   Precious metals futures prices, which usually follow the energy
futures market, plummeted after traders began selling off on rumors
that the cash-strapped Soviet Union is expected to sell off a good
quantity of its gold supply to finance recent purchases of grains
and other goods.
   A large sell-off would flood the market and cause a drop in
prices.
   ``All those Russian purchases put a lot of pressure on the
market,'' said Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago. ``Buying started to dry up, then there was a lot
of local selling and dealer selling.''
   Prices also fell amid a perceived inability to keep up with
energy futures prices, Platt said.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures rose sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting fears on a report from Iraq's
Saddam Hussein that the country had developed a new missile capable
of striking deep within Saudi Arabia, where U.S. troops are
positioned.
   Light sweet crude settled 14 cents to $1.45 higher with November
at $40.40 a barrel; heating oil was 1.30 cents to 3.19 cents higher
with November at $1.0615 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.05 cents
to 4.51 cents higher with November at 98.26 cents a gallon.
   Grains and soybeans all were mixed at the close of a slow day on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures prices remained in the same range following a
sharp rally Monday that was spurred by harvest delays in the
rain-soaked Midwest. Corn and wheat futures prices advanced
slightly on rumors of possible export business, analysts said.
   ``We had wet conditions slowing the harvest (of soybeans) that
kept prices up,'' said Mickey Luth, a grains analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Other than that, it was pretty much a nothing
session - consolidating after yesterday's sharp rallies.''
   Speculators also stood on the sidelines in advance of a report
from the Agriculture Department on Thursday with updated crop
estimates, Luth said.
   Wheat futures settled } cent lower to 2 cents higher with
December at $2.78{ a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 1\ cents
higher with December at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents lower
across the board with December at $1.22\ a bushel; soybeans were
\cent to 4{ cents higher with November at $6.34\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
expectations of higher cattle cash prices amid a short-term
shortage of animals for slaughter. Price also rose as fears eased
that meat inspectors would be furloughed through stalled federal
budget negotiations.
   Pork futures were lifted by professional buying following
Monday's sharp drop-off.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 to .18 cent higher with October
at 79.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .30
cent higher with October at 88.12 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent
to .80 cent higher with October at 56.72 cents a pound; pork
bellies were .08 cent lower to .73 cent higher with February at
64.45 cents a pound.

<HEAD>American Airlines To Eliminate 1,000 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines has sent layoff
notices to about 40 employees as part of a plan to eliminate 1,000
jobs and reduce costs, the company said Tuesday.
   The Fort Worth-based airline, which employs more than 90,400
workers, took the action because of rising jet fuel prices and a
weakening U.S. economy. Spokesman Al Becker said the first notices
were sent to about 40 people systemwide.
   ``The move is an effort to reduce costs,'' Becker said. ``The
(cost-cutting) plan isn't completed yet and won't be for several
more weeks.''
   Trans World Airlines and USAir have also announced layoffs
recently.
   Becker said this was the first time in several years that
American has been forced to eliminate jobs because of rising fuel
prices.
   Officials had said this past summer that the company planned to
reduce costs sharply, and an unexpected rise in the price of jet
fuel last winter contributed to a first-quarter loss of $19.3
million.
   An unexpected decline in domestic air travel helped reduce
second-quarter profits to $129.2 million, 27.4 percent less than
the comparable period in 1989.
   Jet fuel prices have soared again recently because of Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   American officials had planned to reduce costs by implementing a
freeze in management and clerical ranks. The company said it
planned to eliminate about 1,000 jobs primarily through attrition,
but did not rule out layoffs if necessary.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Slump on Rising Oil Prices, Budget and Interest Rate
Worries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices plunged Tuesday as oil prices
climbed past $40 a barrel and investors grew increasingly
pessimistic about interest rates and the ability of Congress to
pass a meaningful budget agreement.
   There was also concern about an oversupply of government bonds,
with two auctions planned this week and the Treasury's quarterly
refunding sale coming up next month.
   ``It would be difficult to conjure up a worse confluence of
factors'' than those hitting the credit markets Tuesday, said Ward
McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped 1 25-32 points, or
about $17.81 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when
the bond's price falls, soared to 8.96 percent from 8.81 percent
late Monday.
   Growing fears of war in the Persian Gulf unsettled the bond
market and also sent oil prices rising. The higher energy costs
underscored worries about inflation, which erodes the value of
bonds.
   The November contract for light, sweet crude oil swept past $40
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at $40.40 a barrel, up
$1.45.
   A surge in inflation carries another threat for bonds - it gives
the Federal Reserve less room to ease its monetary policy and allow
interest rates to drop.
   Bond traders have been waiting anxiously for the Fed to relax
credit, but they think higher oil prices and, more importantly, the
lack of a budget agreement in Washington, will prevent the Fed from
acting.
   McCarthy said bond traders were filled with ``utter disgust with
the budget process.''
   President Bush signed emergency legislation Tuesday that allows
the government to operate while Congress continues to haggle over
an agreement that would cut the federal budget deficit by $500
billion over five years.
   The credit markets, having seen a budget agreement collapse last
week, are losing faith in the lawmakers' ability to reach a
meaningful agreement.
   ``What seems to motivate Congress in the budget is
self-preservation and the desire to get re-elected,'' McCarthy
said. ``National interest plays a secondary if not tertiary role.''
   The credit markets were also concerned that with several bond
sales planned, there will be so many issues on the market that
prices will drop to spark demand.
   The government is selling $8.5 billion in seven-year bonds this
week, along with $5 billion in 30-year bonds to help fund the
savings and loan bailout. The Treasury is also preparing for its
quarterly refunding sale next month.
   Bond traders are also concerned that with the dollar at
depressed levels, foreign investors will have little interest in

   Stocks fell sharply Tuesday as record-high oil
prices and new war jitters pushed aside federal budget troubles as
the market's focal point.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 78.22 points, or
3.1 percent, to close at 2,445.54. It was the Dow average's 11th
worst point drop, after the fall of 86.61 points on Sept. 11, 1986.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,313 down, 288 up and
388 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 145.61 million shares, up from 99.47
million shares on Monday.
   The Dow average was down 23.26 points during the first half hour
of trading as oil futures began moving toward an all-time high of
$40.95 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, fueling
fears of higher inflation. The stock market's losses built steadily
as traders kept selling amid heightened fears of war in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``They don't want to own them overnight when there was such
missile-rattling by Saddam Hussein,'' said market analyst Jack
Solomon of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. The Iraqi leader claimed he has a
long-range missile that could threaten Saudi Arabia or Israel.
   Wall Streeters also had doubts about emergency legislation
signed by President Bush to keep the government open for another 11
days. Bush said there was ``no assurance'' Congress would reach
agreement on a $500 billion deficit reduction package.
   Vice President Larry Wachtel at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
called the political move a ``non-event'' and said oil prices were
``the minute-to-minute focus of the market.''
   The most active NYSE stock was Motorola Inc., down 7 to 52}
after settling a patent infringement battle with Hitachi Ltd.
   ``The people who had been betting on Motorola were disappointed
Motorola didn't walk away a legal winner,'' Solomon said.
   Travelers Corp. fell another 1&rsqb; to 13 amid continued concern
over its recent losses.
   UAL Corp. was down 3\ to 88 after its board rejected an employee
buyout bid, which became the fourth failed attempt to take over the
airline in three years.
   The news from UAL helped propel Boeing up { to 44&rsqb;, as traders
believed it likely that the airline would be ordering new planes
that had been put on hold while the takeover offer had been in
effect.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
4.24 to 167.41.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 176.00 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $70.7 billion, or 2.41
percent, to a value of $2.867 trillion.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 10.51 to 358.67, and

   Intel Corp. said it has been granted
a temporary restraining order barring Advanced Micro Devices from
using the ``386'' designator on any of its products.
   The order remains in effect until Oct. 15, when a judge may rule
on Intel's request to keep the Sunnyvale chip maker from using the
number, which Intel uses on its trademark 80386 microprocessor.
Intel said the temporary order was issued Friday.
   Intel has been the sole supplier of the 80386, which is the
brains of the latest IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers. It
is suing AMD for alleged trademark infringement.
   Last week, AMD acknowledged it has an unannounced product
``functionally equivalent to Intel's 80386 and that is called
internally the AM386,'' according to AMD spokesman John Greenagel.
   The product has been shipped to customers, and other Silicon
Valley companies have said they plan to provide chips compatible
with the 80386.

   Air Canada will lay off about 2,900 of its
23,000 employees and cut routes to Europe and the Far East because
of rising fuel costs and fewer passengers, the airline announced
Tuesday.
   Hardest hit will be mechanics and ramp workers - which include
baggage handlers - who will see their workforce cut by about 1,390
across Canada.
   Layoffs will also include 220 pilots, 440 flight attendants, 425
ticket agents and 265 managers and clerks.
   Flights to Athens, Lisbon and Madrid, and Bombay and Singapore
will be cut and the airline will sell some aircraft and close its
Halifax maintenance base. Most of the cuts would be implemented by
Jan. 31, said Claude Taylor, Air Canada chairman. The layoffs in
management would likely be completed by mid-1991.
   ``The passenger market is well down this year and fuel costs are
driving us to raise our prices,'' Taylor said.

<HEAD>IMF Downgrades Dollar, Pound, Franc; Upgrades Yen, Mark</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund announced on
Tuesday that it is downgrading the dollar, pound and French franc,
and upgrading the German mark and Japanese yen in setting the value
of its own currency unit.
   The IMF currency - special drawing rights, or SDR - is set as a
``basket'' of the five currencies, with each of them weighted by
its importance in world trade.
   Currently, 42 percent of the value is the value of the dollar,
19 percent he value of the mark, 15 percent for the yen and 12
percent each for the franc and the pound. This proportion was set
in 1986.
   It is revised every five years. Beginning Jan. 1, the
proportions will be 40 percent for the dollar, 21 percent for the
mark, 17 percent for the yen and 11 percent each for the pound and
the franc.
   The SDR is not printed in notes or stamped as coin and is not
used in private trade. It exists only as a bookkeeping entry.
   The fund issued SDRs to give member countries a reserve currency
that they could use in addition to gold and dollars. The object was
to make the member countries less dependent on the United States,
which controls the number of dollars in the world, and on the
Soviet Union and South Africa, the major sources of gold. Some
advocates of the SDR hoped that it would eventually replace gold
and dollars in the world's resevres, thus making the fund into a
world-wide central bank.
   The fund now has 154 member countries.
   SDRs are distributed in proportion to a country's contribution
to the fund. That means that the United States and other major
industrial countries get the biggest share. Governments of poorer
countries have repeatedly asked for new issues to be made on the
basis of need, but the United States has turned the idea down.

<HEAD>IBM to Settle Overcharges, Justice Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   IBM Corp. has agreed to pay the government
almost $800,000 to settle allegations of overcharging on the sale
of electric typewriters, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
   The department said the General Services Administration, which
bought an unspecified number of typewriters in 1985 and 1986,
complained that IBM provided incomplete pricing data which resulted
in the overcharges.
   The $798,764 IBM will pay ``represents a full recovery of the
United States' monetary loss plus interest,'' the department said.
   In exchange, IBM is released from any ``further potential civil
proceedings.'' No actual lawsuit had begun.

<HEAD>Standard &amp; Poor's Places City's Bond Rating on Credit Watch</HEAD>

   A major bond rating agency said Tuesday it is
reviewing the status of New York City's ability to repay debt
following a tentative agreement to give teachers a 5.5 percent pay
raise.
   After reviewing its A-minus rating of New York City's $13
billion in outstanding general obligation bonds, Standard &amp; Poors
Corp. could decide to lower the rating.
   ``I'm confident we are going to satisfy them that we are in
control,'' Mayor David Dinkins said at a City Hall press
conference. ``We have a plan. We are going to meet that gap.''
   The mayor has projected a $1.4 billion budget deficit for next
year.
   S&amp;P said it was reevaluating the city's payroll burden in light
of a weakening economy that leads to lower tax revenues.
   State Comptroller Edward Regan said S&amp;P's move appeared to be
based on a perception of economic crisis, rather than reality.
   ``The city is not on the verge of an economic disaster,'' Regan
said. ``It's a cyclical downturn with an erosion of revenue, but
that can be handled. The problem is that this year's budget was too
large to begin with.''
   An A-rating from S&amp;P means the agency believes the city has a
strong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds, although
that ability is more susceptible to economic downswings. A plus or
minus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within the
catagory.
   The next step lower is a BBB-rating, which signifies that
adverse conditions make it more likely the city will have trouble
paying interest and principal.
   Lower ratings make it more expensive to borrow money in the bond
market since investors usually demand higher yields for the riskier
debt.
   City Council President Andrew Stein said it was inconceivable
that the administration could give teachers a 5.5 percent pay raise
on Monday ``and then announce on Thursday that it was planning for
15,000 layoffs. This is not fiscal leadership. It is fiscal
folly.''
   Dinkins said the city has met past financial difficulties and
that, ``I can assure Standard and Poor's, taxpayers, noteholders
and the citizens of this city that my administration will continue
this tradition of responding fully and quickly to the difficulties
a deteriorating economy and rising costs pose for our budget.''
