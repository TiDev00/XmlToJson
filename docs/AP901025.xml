   The House approved a military spending bill
Thursday that slashes President Bush's 1991 budget request for the
Strategic Defense Initiative but adopts the Pentagon's plan for a
high-tech fighter aircraft.
   By voice vote, the House passed the legislation which provides
$268 billion for the nation's defense in the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1, a cut of $19 billion from Bush's initial proposal in
January.
   Debate and final passage of the largest bill before the Congress
took a mere 11 minutes as lawmakers push to adjourn before Sunday.
The legislation now goes to the Senate, which is expected to
approve the measure.
   The Senate was unable to complete debate and put off final
action until Friday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney supports the spending bill and
Bush's signature is likely.
   Among the provisions in the bill, which meets the targets set in
a defense blueprint adopted by the House late Wednesday, is a
nearly $2 billion cut in Bush's $4.7 billion request for SDI and a
reduction in funds for the B-2 stealth bomber that keeps the
program alive for at least one more year.
   ``This bill shows restraint. It's a lean bill,'' said Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
defense.
   The legislation largely tracks the military blueprint but breaks
ranks with the authorization bill on several issues.
   The spending plan calls for a troop cut of 78,500 from the 2.1
million men and women in uniform worldwide, just over $900 million
for the MILSTAR communications satellite and full-scale development
of the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   The administration requested $283 million for full-scale
development and $763 million to complete the demonstration and
validation phase of the prototype aircraft.
   The defense blueprint provides $964 million for the program but
prohibits full-scale development in fiscal 1991.
   The authorization bill emphasizes the need for the Air Force to
finish demonstrating several technologies, including aerodynamic
performance, low observability and engine capability, before
beginning full-scale development.
   The Pentagon plans to begin buying the aircraft, intended to
replace the Air Force's F-15, in 1996. The total number of fighters
to be bought is 750.
   The spending bill concurs with the administration's request on
the fighter as well as its proposal for the SRAM-T, a stand-off
tactical nuclear weapon.
   The Pentagon sought $118 million in fiscal 1991 to begin SRAM-T
test units and F-15E adaptor hardware. The authorization bill
provides $35 million while the spending bill meets the
administration's total.
   The blueprint reduces U.S. troop levels by 100,000, but, bowing
to pressure from the Pentagon, gives the defense secretary added
authority to limit the troop cut to 80,000 if he believes the U.S.
military buildup in the Persian Gulf warrants such a step.
  The authorization bill also provides $600 million for MILSTAR,
but again, responding to Pentagon demands, gives Cheney the
authority to transfer money from other accounts for the program.
   In other action, the House approved a beefed-up version of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, extending its authority for another
three years.
   By voice vote, the House adopted the measure aimed at
revitalizing the U.S. defense industry through an array of steps,
including giving the president the authority to maintain the
technology base.
   ``It will ensure that our troops in the Persian Gulf receive the
equipment and supplies they need,'' said Rep. Joseph Moakley,
D-Mass.

<HEAD>Jury Deadlocks and Mistrial Declared in Rape Case of Comedian's

<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared Thursday in the case
of a bodyguard accused of raping comedian Sam Kinison's girlfriend.
   The Superior Court jury deliberated 2{ days before announcing it
was deadlocked on five felony counts of rape and sexual assault
against Unway Carter, 22, of Greensville, S.C.
   Carter was very disappointed, said his public defender, Barry
Collins.
   The 6-foot-4, 300-pound Carter, who was hired to protect
Kinison, was charged with raping Kinison's girlfriend June 21 after
bringing the couple home from a party. Kinison was asleep in
another part of the house during the alleged assault.
   Carter testified earlier this month that the 26-year-old woman
consented to having sexual intercourse with him.
   Carter has been in custody since June in lieu of $100,000 bail.
   Collins said prosecutors could take a week to decide whether to
seek a retrial of the case.
   ``After speaking to the jury, if we have to try this case again
it can only get better for Mr. Carter,'' Collins said. ``There's no
more evidence, nothing in this case that is going to make it harder
for us next time.''

   About 84 metric tons of munitions that were
supposed to have been unloaded in the Middle East showed up at the
Port of New Orleans near a shopping mall, federal authorities said.
   ``We are certainly not happy about it and we will take any steps
necessary to make sure it doesn't happen again,'' said Marge Holtz,
spokeswoman for the Navy's Military Sealift Command in Washington.
   The munitions arrived in New Orleans aboard the ship Green
Island, which pulled into port about Oct. 18, said Coast Guard Lt.
Anthony Morris.
   The vessel, owned by Central Gulf Lines Inc., was leased to the
Sealift Command. It was designed to carry barges full of cargo.
   Workers on Friday discovered that one barge removed from the
ship was full of munitions, Morris said. Two more barges full of
munitions were discovered Tuesday.
   The barges were towed from a dock on the Mississippi River's
east bank near the Riverwalk shopping mall to a more secluded west
bank dock, Morris said.
   Central Gulf Lines employees notified the Coast Guard
immediately after the first explosives were discovered, Morris
said.
   Holtz said the Green Island and its cargo of munitions were part
of a ``pre-positioned'' force in place at Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait prompted the U.S.
military's Desert Shield operation.
   The Green Island was sent to the Persian Gulf where the
munitions were apparently supposed to be unloaded, said Ms. Holtz.
   She said investigators from the Defense Department and the
Inspector General's office were sent to New Orleans to look into
the matter.
   Meanwhil, the Coast Guard tightened security around the ship.
Coast Guard broadcasts warned other ships to steer clear of the
Green Island.

<HEAD>ABC Films Lawmakers Easter Trip To Barbados</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While millions of Americans were spending last
Easter weekend rushing to finish their taxes, members of the main
House taxation committee were on a taxpayer-paid trip to Barbados -
on something like Candid Camera.
   There to discuss a trade bill, the lawmakers spent much of their
time frolicking at the pool, being entertained by lobbyists, or
golfing at taxpayers' expense - unknowingly under the watchful eyes
of a television news crew.
   The five-day, four-night stay at the Paradise Village and Beach
Club came at the end of a 12-day official committee trip by 34
people that also included stops in several South American cities.
   The bill: $100,000 in all; $40,000 for the Barbados portion.
   The eight members of the House Ways and Means Committee were met
and entertained on the Caribbean island by lobbyists representing
insurance and computer companies with interests before the
tax-writing panel.
   What the lawmakers, aides, spouses and military escorts on the
trip didn't know is that much of their visit was videotaped by a
crew from ABC-TV's ``PrimeTime Live,'' which broadcast a report on
the trip Thursday night.
   The Barbados stop was approved by committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., so the lawmakers could research the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, a trade bill before the panel.
   According to ABC, the lawmakers spent less than seven hours in
business meetings and most of their time relaxing; each billed the
government for $1,176 in daily expenses and other expense costs,
even though they received many of their meals free at official
receptions or those hosted by lobbyists.
   On the second day of the trip, the lawmakers attended a
40-minute morning meeting on the trade legislation and another
hour-long meeting later after a luncheon at the prime minister's
residence, according to the network.
   By midafternoon the work was done and three members went
golfing, billing their green's fees to the U.S. Embassy. Other
lawmakers and members of the delegation relaxed at the resort pool.
   ``I think that this idea that the press thinks these trips are
junkets is absolutely ridiculous,'' one of the three golfing
lawmakers on the trip, Democratic Rep. Marty Russo of Illinois,
told ABC. ``The bottom line is we work very hard on these trips.''
   Also on the trip, were Rostenkowski, Democratic Reps. Fortney
Stark of California, Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut, Thomas Downey
of New York and George Miller of California and Republican Reps.
Richard Schulze of Pennsylvania, Raymond McGrath of New York and
Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan. Miller is not a member of the Ways and
Means Committee but was invited on the trip by Rostenkowski.
   The videotape of the trip shows lawmakers swimming, snorkeling,
jet skiing, sunbathing and playing football with some of the
lobbyists.
   The lobbyists included two for mutual insurance companies that
would benefit under tax legislation filed by Downey and a former
top Russo aide who now works at a law firm representing Comdisco, a
Chicago a computer company that would benefit from leigislation
filed by Russo.
   Until last year, Russo was on retainer for the same law firm,
Coffield, Ungaretti, Harris and Slavin. Russo's past two financial
disclosure forms show he received $25,000 from the firm in 1988 and
1989.
   Downey, who only participated in the Barbados portion of the
trip and was videotaped with one of the insurance lobbyists before
the rest of the delegation arrived, told the program there was no
discussion of legislation with the lobbysits.
   He said he suspected the lobbyists were there ``so that they can
see us in an informal setting.''
   Russo said he did not believe his legislation presented a
conflict because of his past role at the law firm. He said his
former aide's role as a lobbyist had nothing to do with his
introducing the legislation.
   ``I introduced a bill for the computer industry because I think
the computer indistry in this country is being unfairly taken
advantage of,'' he said.
   ABC said the other lawmakers on the trip declined to be
interviewed for the segment. ABC traveled to Barbados ahead of the
delegation after receving a tip about the trip, and the crew
videotaped the activities of the delegation using hand-held
cameras.

   An Army dental surgeon accused of
dressing as a woman and performing in a bar frequented by
homosexuals was dismissed from the service Thursday and sentenced
to nine months in prison.
   A court-martial board announced the sentence the same day it
found Col. Edward Modesto guilty of eight counts of conduct
unbecoming an officer.
   The nine-member board acquitted Modesto of two counts of
indecent exposure, stemming from allegations he exposed himself to
women at several Laundromats.
   Modesto's attorney, Walter Gerash, said he planned to file a
motion for a mistrial.
   Modesto was confined at Fort Carson and was scheduled to go
Friday to Fort Leavenworth, where he is to serve his sentence, Fort
Carson spokesman Maryl Neff said.
   A 17-year Army veteran, Modesto, 43, was charged in April after
he allegedly engaged in homosexual acts, dressed in women's
clothing and performed at a bar frequented by homosexuals.
   Modesto pleaded not guilty to the indecent exposure charges and
twice offered to resign rather than face a court-martial for
violating the Army's ban on homosexuality.
   Military regulations prohibit homosexuality in the ranks, saying
it threatens security and morale.
   Modesto is the highest-ranking officer to be court-martialed
under the homosexual regulations at Fort Carson in at least three
years.
   A father of three, Modesto testified Wednesday that he made the
agonizing decision to acknowledge his repressed homosexuality when
he turned 40. He and his wife are estranged.

   Six typhoid fever outbreaks nationally this year
equals the number reported in all of the 1980s, federal health
officials said.
   One outbreak, in Washington state, was linked to a large family
reunion, Centers for Disease Control researchers said Thursday. The
locations of the other outbreaks weren't disclosed, but the
researchers said two were reported in restaurants, one was linked
to home-cooked food, one was traced to imported shellfish and the
other had an unknown origin.
   Typhoid fever, once a dreaded disease, is most commonly linked
to poor sanitation; it is spread via contaminated food and water.
It's now rare in the developed world.
   Symptoms include fever, headache, pains and nausea.
   Preliminary CDC reports show 406 cases reported nationwide, with
10 weeks remaining in the year; if that rate continues, the 1990
total could reach 503, the most since 1983.
   The CDC received reports of only six typhoid outbreaks - or
clusters of cases - from 1980 to 1989.
   The family reunion outbreak occurred at a gathering of 293
people from five states in Skagit County, Wash., the CDC said. At
least 17 people at the reunion were dagnosed with typhoid fever;
the average illness lasted 20 days.
   Health investigators found that three food items served at the
reunion were linked to the outbreak; a person who prepared one of
them tested positive as a carrier of the typhoid bacteria.
   Typhoid is preventable by a vaccine recommended for Americans
traveling to areas with typhoid problems, such as Central and South
America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. The vaccine has been
reported to cause severe side effects in some cases, including high
fever, but an oral vaccine approved earlier this year promises
fewer side effects.

   ABC television said it will reveal on Nov. 10
the identity of ``Bob,'' killer of teen queen Laura Palmer on the
much-hyped but little-watched nighttime series ``Twin Peaks.''
   Episodes this season made it very clear to viewers that ``Bob''
is responsible for the 6-month-old slaying, ABC programming chief
Bob Iger told reporters Thursday at the network's West Coast
headquarters.
   Problem is, it's unclear just who or what ``Bob'' is. A demon? A
person? A distant cousin of Freddy Krueger?
   ``On Nov. 10, you will know who Bob is,'' Iger said.
   ABC has promised before to identify the murderer in its
downright confusing ``Twin Peaks'' series. So far, the network
hasn't made good on that promise.

   A television network said Thursday the Justice
Department is looking into a convicted murderer's allegations that
at least 25 blacks were abducted from the Washington area, then
tortured and killed by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s.
   Fox News said some of the bodies may be buried in mass graves
near Warrenton, Va., about 45 miles southwest of Washington.
   Authorities were told of the abductions by Edward Allen See, an
inmate in a Nevada prison, Fox said. See is serving a life sentence
without possibility of parole for the murders of two women.
   The network said See was ``having trouble identifying the
specific place'' of burial, and no one had yet searched for the
bodies.
   Justice Department spokesman Michael Robinson told The
Associated Press he had no information about the report.
   The network said See told the FBI a number of blacks were
kidnapped at random from the streets of Washington.
   See also has alleged the killings were done with the complicity
of local law enforcement officials and politicians.
   See has passed one lie detector test and is scheduled for
another next week, Fox said.
   But his mother told authorities on one occasion he was ``a liar
who just wants attention.''

<TEXT>
   Daniel Ortega, who won international
respect by accepting an election defeat, says revolution in Latin
America may survive the collapse of European communism, but not if
its leaders cling to dogma.
   Nicaragua's former president said in an interview that injustice
and poverty still are problems in the region, providing the fodder
of revolution.
   At 46, with a decade of leadership behind him as head of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front, Ortega has abandoned the
olive fatigues and black-and-red bandanna of his guerrilla days and
years in power. President Bush once compared the outfit to a Boy
Scout uniform.
   Ortega cultivates a youthful image, dressing in jeans and
colorful shirts, and remains politically active in Nicaragua and
abroad. Young admirers pursue him for autographs when he appears in
public.
   His acceptance of the February election loss to Violeta
Chamorro, Nicaragua's new president, improved his image in the
world. At home, Ortega has reined in the more radical elements of
the Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   A combination of Ortega's influence and two crippling strikes
led by the Sandinistas persuaded the new government to retain many
Sandinista programs, including land distribution.
   ``The reality of Nicaragua is that no one can govern without the
FSLN'' he said, using the initials of the Sandinista Front.
   ``I am sure that our talks with the government and our attempts
to reach a consensus have angered some people inside the
government, but we think common sense is prevailing.''
   Elements of Mrs. Chamorro's fractious coalition accuse her of
weakness for dealing with the Sandinistas, who are by far the
largest party in Nicaragua and want to be consulted on important
economic decisions.
   The Sandinistas oppose such austerity measures as currency
devaluations, reductions in the public payroll and selling
nationalized industries back to private investors.
   Ortega works for the party and travels abroad seeking foreign
aid for Nicaragua.
   He said being out of office allows him more time with his eight
children, but that they interfere with a book he is writing on the
years in government.
   Wealthy nations are focusing on their own concerns at the
expense of Latin America and other poor regions, Ortega said.
   ``We will now see an industrialized North, including the former
Socialist countries, that will determine the distribution of the
world's technological resources,'' he predicted. ``The problems of
the Third World will continue. The industrialized countries of the
North have no time to consider our economies or problems in the
South.''
   U.S. economic assistance to Mrs. Chamorro's government has not
met Nicaraguan expectations. About $65 million in cash has been
provided since April and an additional $40 million is promised in
credits for agricultural development.
   ``The collapse of the Eastern Socialist bloc gives the United
States the hegemonic control that always was its objective in Latin
America,'' Ortega said. ``The policies of assistance of the
Socialist bloc . . . disappear and they are not compensated by the
United States or other industrialized countries.
   ``This places Latin America at a disadvantage. It does not help
our countries. The need for revolutionary change remains.
   ``We still have a revolutionary movement in El Salvador, and
Brazil can explode, too. We have armed groups in Peru and Colombia.
What happened in the East does not improve the living conditions of
people in the South.''
   Washington no longer can accuse all revolutionary movements of
being communist, Ortega added, and ``at the same time, the
revolutionary movement must rethink the kind of projects and
programs they want. In the past there was a tendency to
dogmatism.''
   ``Our revolution was never subordinated to the Soviet Union,''
he said. ``They offered their support after the victory.''
   ``The United States must show respect for Latin America if it
wants a world of peace, and Latin America must increase its
contacts with sectors of influence in the United States that . . .
know the rich will sink if the needs of the poor are not
satisfied,'' Ortega said.
   Of Nicaragua's future and the Sandinista role in it, he said:
``We realize this government came to power with the help of the
United States. We accepted the challenge in the elections.
   ``But the Nicaraguan revolution's changes brought on by the
Sandinista Front remain.
   ``Now the party must change, and adapt to the times. Neither the
structure nor the programs of a party are immovable. We now need
other forms, although the objectives of ending human exploitation
and the principles of justice remain.''
   ``We still have a lot to do to emerge from the crisis,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The Prince of Wales called for an end to the
destruction of Britain's wildlife habitats, which he said were
damaged by development.
   Nearly 700 sites of special scientific interest were lost or
damaged between 1984 and 1988, the heir to the British throne said
Thursday, quoting government figures.
   Road-building plans in southeast Britain could damage more than
370 other sites, he said.
   The prince, patron of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation,
was speaking at the release of a society report on nature
conservation in Britain.
   In a videotaped message played at a London news conference, the
prince said there was widespread recognition of the need to consult
environmental groups before going ahead with development.
   ``One pond drained, one new road through one small corner of an
ancient woodland, might not in itself be a disaster, but the
destruction of a whole network of sites, by a whole catalogue of
changes, can destroy the viability of entire communities of
wildlife,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Ask Maximum, One-Year Sentence for Mayor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS graf 2 and grafs 6-10 bgng: ``In his,'' letters to
judge from Barry and his wife.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors, saying that Marion Barry
is sorry ``only that he got caught,'' urged Thursday that the
city's mayor be given the maximum sentence of one year in prison
and be fined $100,000 for his misdemeanor cocaine conviction.
   Barry, meanwhile, pleaded for mercy from the judge, saying he is
sorry for his actions and already has been humiliated. The mayor's
wife, Effi, also wrote to the judge, saying some of the witnesses
at her husband's trial were lying and that the ordeal has left him
``publicly castrated.''
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is scheduled to
sentence Barry on Friday.
   In a memo, U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said Barry has shown a
``flagrant disregard for the law and seriously impugned the
integrity'' of his office.
   ``In short, the defendant is not genuinely remorseful about his
criminality,'' the document said. ``He is sorry only that he got
caught.''
   Barry was convicted Aug. 10 on one count of cocaine possession
and acquitted of another. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on
the remaining 12 counts, including three perjury charges.
   In his letter, Barry wrote that he is a drug addict and was
``deeply sorry'' for behavior he called ``degrading and
outrageous.''
  ``When I sat in your courtroom each day, hearing things about
myself that I had not wanted to face, I may have appeared to be
calm and unmoved, but on the inside I was suffering nearly
unbearable humiliation and deepest regret,'' Barry wrote to
Jackson.
   Mrs. Barry asked the judge to ``search your humanity.''
   ``What further punishment does this man deserve?'' the mayor's
wife wrote. ``For certain there can be no greater sentence than to
have the whole world tune into your day in court as you are
publicly castrated.''
   The letters from Barry and his wife were included with numerous
documents filed on his behalf with the court on Thursday, The
Washington Post reported in its Friday editions.
   At a hearing last week, Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy,
objected to a finding in the probation officer's report that the
mayor was not sorry for his actions.
   Stephens decided not to retry the 54-year-old mayor and Mundy
said Barry had decided not to seek a new trial on the one
conviction.
   In the government's sentencing memo, Stephens charged Barry had
a ``brazen disregard for the law'' which ``conveyed a particularly
devastating message to a number of people.''
   According to the prosecutor, Barry's conduct was
``disheartening'' to law enforcement officers who were struggling
to bring drug-driven crime in the district under control.
   Barry also undermined the nation's efforts to work with foreign
countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs, Stephens maintained.
   ``How are we to explain to these officials that our efforts to
reduce the near-insatiable demand for drugs in this country is
earnest and is not empty rhetoric when an elected official who

   He also said Barry's actions had a ``devastating effect'' on
efforts to convince young people that ``their future as well as
ours rests with their rejection of drugs.''

possessions.''
   Barry's third, four-year term as mayor expires in January. He is

   Picture a child playing war games
in a sandbox, marching his toy soldiers here, moving toy tanks
there, leveling ripples with his bulldozers and roaring his play
jets overhead with sweeps of the hand.
   That's a miniature version of what it looks like in Saudi
Arabia, except the sandbox is an endless tract of desert and the
soldiers and weapons are real.
   The United States has deployed some 210,000 troops in Operation
Desert Shield and thousands of missiles, artillery pieces, tanks,
combat jets and armed helicopters to confront Saddam Hussein in
occupied Kuwait.
   The British, French, Saudis, Egyptians, Pakistanis and other
allies have sent thousands more men with their arsenals of modern
weapons.
   This deployment, the biggest U.S. military operation overseas
since Vietnam, has turned the desert, once the domicile of Bedouin
and camels, into an awesome arena of military power.
   Less than three months ago, the only tracks in the desert were
from the hooves of hardy animals. Now those tracks have been
obliterated by the crazy-quilt pattern of tank treads, armored
personnel carriers, trucks and the new generation of jeep.
   Where once the desert air was pierced by the occasional bleating
of goats, jet engines whine, the dull thud of helicopter blades
assaults the ears and the crack of guns is heard on practice
ranges.
   Clouds of dust spit up by columns of vehicles on the move whirl
through the air.
   There is something captivating and scary about all this military
maneuvering.
   From a helicopter cockpit, the olive-drab tents of military
encampments look like mushroom clusters. They contrast with the
white Bedouin tents donated by the Saudis.
   Scout helicopters skim along the horizon like angry hornets
buzzing from their nest to respond to intruders.
   From the road, the barrels of guns on tanks dug in among the
dunes poke out from under camouflage nets toward the north, where
an estimated 430,000 Iraqis are deployed in and around Kuwait.
   To say hello, crews flash hand signals used by surfers.
   Near port facilities, Patriot surface-to-air missiles, designed
to take out hostile incoming missiles, point northward.
   Sandbag bunkers surround encampments and giant, closed
warehouses that the imagination fills with endless stacks of
ammunition and other supplies.
   Concrete barriers rise in roadways to deter truck bombs or other
terrorist attacks.
   Everywhere, convoys are on the move. Some trucks haul soldiers
on maneuvers. Others dash back to the rear for supplies.
   They are the tail that leads to the teeth of the military beast
at the front.
   The front-line troops get hot meals for breakfast and dinner.
These are trucked to the front. So are water for the soldiers and
gasoline for thirsty vehicles.
   Some troops are ferried by bus back to the rear for showers and
what little recreation they can find. Soldiers, like native Saudis,
play football and soccer on grassless fields.
   New features such as a heliport being paved on top of the
blistering landscape materialize almost overnight, like mirages to
a disbelieving wanderer.
   Each morning brings a spectacular dawn, each night an equally
inspiring sunset. The roar of night-time traffic pierces otherwise
silent, starry nights.
   Out of sight, but not out of mind, is an international armada of
more than 70 warships from a dozen countries bobbing in the gulf
and the waters around the Arabian peninsula.
   Even the Saudi cities offer strange images. Concrete and glass
towers rise from the arid wasteland, thanks to the petrobillions
earned from the oilfields.
   These riches allow such luxuries as six-lane highways paved
through the deserts and Baskin-Robbins shops in suburban malls.
   In the bazaar of Al-Khobar, just outside Dhahran, shops offer
T-shirts with Desert Shield themes. One depicts a camel in a gas
mask riding a flying carpet, another shows tanks idled in the sand
with a few Z's printed above and the legend ``All Quiet on the
Eastern Front.''
   Servicemen and women are often seen shopping, mostly buying air
conditioners and stereo equipment to alleviate the heat and boredom
of waiting for a war that might never happen.
   Soldiers in airy desert camouflage fatigues hardly raise
eyebrows any more when they wander through hotel lobbies or grocery
stores carrying rifles and sidearms.
   The sandbox is accustomed to the real-life war machine.

<HEAD>Peruvian Writer Praises Nobel Prize Winner Octavio Paz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa,
whose novel ``Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'' has just become a
Hollywood movie, says he's proud the Nobel Prize for Literature
went to Mexican poet Octavio Paz.
   ``I think Octavio Paz is a great poet, one of the greatest
intellectuals of our time,'' Vargas Llosa said in an interview with
local television. ``So it made me very proud as a Latin American
that the prize went to Octavio Paz.''
   Vargas Llosa, 54, was visiting Puerto Rico for the CinemaFest
film festival which opened Thursday night with the movie ``Tune in
Tomorrow'' based on his ``Aunt Julia.''
   Vargas Llosa made an unsuccesful bid for the presidency of Peru
in June, losing in an upset to maverick candidate Alberto Fujimori.
Vargas Llosa said Thursday he had no further political plans and
would dedicate his life to literature.
   Vargas Llosa said he loved ``Tune in Tomorrow,'' starring Peter
Falk and Barbara Hershey, although the film adaptation did not
follow to the letter his novel about a young man who falls in love
with an older woman, the sister of his uncle's wife.
   ``Movies are another medium of expression,'' he said. ``The
novel is the written word and films are images.''
   Another Vargas Llosa novel dealing with an affair between a
young man and a relative, the erotic ``In Praise of the
Stepmother,'' was published in English this fall.

   Britain will reopen its embassy in Tehran this
weekend with a staff of five, the Foreign Office said, and Iran
will staff its reopened embassy in London with a similar number of
people.
   The five Britons will fly to Tehran on Saturday and reopen the
embassy the following day, a Foreign Office spokesman said
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The two countries will not exchange ambassadors for the time
being, the spokesman said.
   The move was agreed to at a meeting last month between Douglas
Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's
foreign minister.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain 18 months ago over
the Salman Rushdie affair.
   Rushdie, the Indian-born British novelist, was condemned to
death in February 1989 by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel
``The Satanic Verses.'' Rushdie has been in hiding ever since.

<TEXT>
   Japan's proposal to deploy troops overseas is being
dragged down by fierce resistance in Parliament, and if it fails
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's job could go with it, analysts say.
   Polls published Thursday showed Kaifu's popularity in a sharp
dive, largely because of the perception that he is waffling on a
decisive issue for Japan in the Persian Gulf standoff.
   That negative image has been magnified by televised debate in
Parliament over the deployment bill, an acutely sensitive issue in
this nation. Kaifu is seen repeatedly shifting position under
attack from opposition members, who seem to have enough votes to
defeat the bill.
   ``Kaifu has done it with spectacular incompetence,'' said
Garrett Scalera, president of the Tokyo Institute of Policy
Studies. ``I think his days are numbered.''
   The newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun published a poll Thursday showing
that support for Kaifu's Cabinet has fallen by 10 points since last
month to 49.8 percent. Most of the drop was attributed to the prime
minister's wavering statements in Parliament.
   Another leading newspaper, the Mainichi Shimbun, put his support
at 35 percent, a drop of 6 points. The polls did not give a margin
of error.
   In July, a Yomiuri poll had Kaifu's popularity at 62.5 percent,
the highest rate for any postwar Cabinet.
   Those results in part reflected the 59-year-old prime minister's
strong showing at the Houston economic summit and U.S. trade talks
earlier in the year. The gulf crisis, however, has been a far more
serious test for Kaifu. And he's responded with a series of
flip-flops.
   After the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, Kaifu announced a financial aid
package for the gulf but declared the nation's Self-Defense Forces
(SDF) would not go. When Japan's senior security partner, the
United States, expressed unhappiness over the decision, Kaifu did
an about-face.
   The result was a proposal to deploy support troops under the
United Nations umbrella. That opened a Pandora's box that Japan has
preferred to keep shut: whether to reconsider its post-World War II
constitutional ban on using force overseas.
   ``Kaifu himself didn't want to send the SDF from the very
beginning. His indecisiveness is the reason why the bill is so
unpopular,'' said Seizaburo Sato, a Tokyo University politics
professor and former adviser to two prime ministers.
   ``If Kaifu really firmly believed it was necessary for Japan to
send the Self-Defense Forces, the people would accept it.''
   Faced with anti-deployment sentiment at home as well as in other
Asian countries, Kaifu has been at best confusing, at worst
self-contradictory under intense grilling from leading opposition
members at a special session of Parliament in recent weeks.
   On Wednesday, for example, he was pressed to clarify what
cooperation Japan could offer to Gulf forces already there. Kaifu
answered he could not say at present, despite previous assertions
that his Peace Cooperation Corps would be involved in
transportation, medical aid and other specific non-combat
activities.
   And he dismissed concerns that corps members might face armed
conflicts overseas, despite some forecasts the gulf could soon
erupt in war.
   Some experts say Kaifu's political weakness in Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, a factor since he was installed in August
1989, has finally come home to roost.
   The prime minister, elected from a small party faction as a
compromise candidate, has been repeatedly embarrassed in recent
weeks as powerful LDP politicians have edged him out of the
headlines by making independent diplomatic initiatives in North and
South Korea and elsewhere.
   Some analysts say those politicians, conservatives themselves
who want a strong deployment bill, see Kaifu as a sacrificial lamb
on the issue.
   Few now believe the overseas deployment bill can be passed by
the time Parliament's special session ends Nov. 10.
   With Kaifu's credibility bound up in the proposal, the only
thing that might save him from resigning if the bill fails is the
lack of a consensus candidate to replace him before his term ends
in November 1991.

<TEXT>
   Frustration over the political and
economic impasse gripping Nicaragua has flared into a wave of
bombings, looting, land takeovers and armed skirmishes.
   President Violeta Chamorro and a 14-party coalition swept to
victory in February, ending more than a decade of revolutionary
Sandinista rule with promises of economic recovery and peace.
   But the Sandinistas, by far the largest and best-organized
pressure group in the country, have used negotiations and muscle to
keep control of the army and police and to block the government's
economic programs.
   In view of the government's relative impotence, some of the
Sandinistas' enemies are threatening to take the situation into
their own hands.
   The Episcopal Conference, the influential organization of
Nicaragua's 11 Roman Catholic bishops, warned Thursday against the
deteriorating situation.
   ``There is a growing frustration in broad sectors of the
population regarding the use and future of the vote cast last Feb.
25 and of the implementation of measures and programs different
from that for which they voted,'' the conference said in a
statement.
   On Wednesday, about 300 demobilized Contra rebels and
sympathizers surrounded the Sandinista-controled police station in
the small town of Rio Blanco, demanding the removal of the police
chief.
   The same day, a gathering of businessmen, government officials,
and independent and Sandinista labor unions broke off negotiations
aimed at developing an economic program, after 34 days of talks.
   While all sides agree that Nicaragua's economy is flattened by
hyperinflation, a fiscal deficit and low production, the government
is being pulled by the demands of leftist Sandinistas and rightist
business groups, neither of which seem willing to compromise.
   The Sandinistas say government proposals to stabilize the
economy will cause mass unemployment. Business groups say the plans
don't go far enough.
   The Superior Council for Private Enterprise, Nicaragua's major
business group, claims the government has diluted its plans to
return property confiscated under leftist Sandinista rule.
   Partial strikes by Sandinista-organized government workers are
frequent and disruptive. Their demands range from pay raises to the
firing of officials appointed by the new government.
   Many of the 20,000 Contra rebels who finished demobilizing in
June are unhappy with what they say are broken government promises
for land.
   Former rebels have taken over Sandinista cooperatives in remote
parts of Nicaragua, and shootouts between ex-rebels and Sandinista
security forces have left more than 12 people dead and scores
wounded.
   Last week, the government declared a state of emergency in the
remote Atlantic town of Puerto Cabezas, where demobilized Indian
rebels looted government warehouses, accusing the officials of
stealing donations intended for them. Three people were wounded and
21 people arrested.
   Earlier this month, at least 200 ex-rebels took over the hamlet
of Waslala in northern Nicaragua, forcing out Sandinista police and
soldiers in clashes that left four dead.
   Around the same time, bombings temporarily silenced two Managua
radio stations, one Sandinista and the other fiercely
anti-Sandinista.

<TEXT>
   Mash-Hoor, a bearded Druse Moslem
militiaman, greased his AK-47 and wrapped it tightly in a plastic
bag to bury it - just in case. Thousands of gunmen like him are
doing the same.
   After countless bloody battles in the course of Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war, the three main Moslem and Christian militias
agreed Thursday to withdraw from Beirut and its environs. But it is
an uneasy peace.
   ``This rifle is mine,'' Mash-Hoor said. ``I won it in a battle
in 1984. Who knows when I or someone dear to me will need it?''
   Approval of the withdrawal plan came from Samir Geagea's
right-wing Chritian Lebanese Forces militia, Nabih Berri's
moderate Shiite Amal militia and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   But Hezbollah, or Party of God, held off on promising a pullout.
The Shiite group is believed be an umbrella for underground
extremists holding most of 13 missing Westerners in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, with some 3,500 main-force fighters, has long feuded
with the more secular Amal for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the country's biggest sect.
   The groundwork was laid for the militia withdrawal when
President Elias Hrawi's Syrian backers crushed a mutiny by rebel
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun Oct. 13 in fighting that killed up to
750 people in eight hours.
   The ultimate objective is to be disarm the militias and absorb
some of their fighters into government security forces. But
hardened gunslingers like Mash-Hoor - a nom de guerre meaning
``Famous'' - don't believe it will happen.
   ``No one believes they'll be disbanded. It never worked before.
It won't work now,'' Mash-Hoor said.
   There are about 20,000 fighters in the dozen or so militias.
Many have their own personal arsenals of automatic weapons, grenade
launchers, explosives and hand grenades.
   During past disarmament bids, fighters handed over some weapons,
but hid most of their arms - including tanks, artillery and
mortars.
   Many of the fighters, like Mash-Hoor, have known nothing but
violence. They are school dropouts, with no skills. Serving in the
militia is a meal ticket - the fighters simply take what they want
at restaurants, bars and gas stations.
   Mash-Hoor has been a member of the Druse Progressive Socialist
Party militia since he was seven years old. The civil war is all
he's ever known.
   He was born Marwan Yahya, and grew up in Druse town of Shweifat,
in the Chouf foothills. When the war broke out in 1975, he was only
a child. But he quit school to join the fighters.
   His first job in the militia was collecting empty cartridge
cases to be refilled. He was dubbed Abu Khartoush - Father of the
Bullets.
   He attended school ``on and off'' during lulls in the fighting,
but he found he no longer fit in.
   ``I was no longer willing to listen to teachers, do homework and
be disciplined,'' he said. ``I was Abu Khartoush.''
   At 12, he was renamed Abu Tabikh, or Father of Food, because ``I
was driving a Land Rover and distributing food to fighters on the
front lines.''
   In 1983, he proved himself as a fighter, battling Christians in
the Chouf Mountains, earning his fighting name. Warfare has been
his trade ever since.
   Unlike Mash-Hoor, Haidar, a 37-year-old Amal militiaman, can now
earn a living from his peacetime profession. Before he took up the
gun, he was a house painter.
   ``There'll be lots of painting work to do in greater Beirut,''
he said, in an understated reference to the war-wrecked capital.
   Haidar echoes Mash-Hoor in his skepticism that the militia will
truly lay down arms.
   He said Amal will withdraw from the south Beirut slum of Shiyah
which it controls. But, he said: ``I have no orders from my
superiors that the militia will be disbanded.''
   Haidar said he'll stay on with his militia as a part-timer. He
said on weekends, he would head south to Amal bases, where the
fighters would regroup.
   ``I don't believe that the war's over once and for all,'' he
said. ``I won't burn my bridges.''

<TEXT>
   The Prophet Mohammed supposedly appears
to Saddam Hussein in a dream and tells him to leave Kuwait. Or
whispers emerge that Israeli troops have crossed the Jordan River
and squared off against Iraq.
   These may be rumors with no relation to the truth, but they move
financial markets thoughout the world, driving the price of oil and
other commodities up or down.
   Either alone or coupled with the legitimate news of the day,
such hearsay can result in drastic swings in which fortunes are
made or lost.
   ``A rumor can affect the market just like real news,'' said Ian
Seymour, editor of the Cyprus-based Middle East Economic Survey, a
respected oil industry publication.
   ``Markets are so greatly volatile that any little rumor can move
them and move them by considerable amounts,'' Seymor said in an
interview. ``Certainly these things go way, way beyond the
fundamental laws of supply and demand, particularly in times of war
and uncertainty.''
   The gulf crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2
provides fertile grist for the Middle East's notorious rumor mill.
   Suddenly, world oil supplies were threatened, propelling prices
skyward. Hints of diplomatic settlements bring them down, while
suggestions of imminent hostilities drive them up again.
   A popular rumor breaking into financial markets over the past
few weeks has been simple but effective: Saddam is dead - slain by
top aides, or Israeli commandos or unknown assassins.
   Although there's a chance it could backfire, the general
interpretation is that the demise of the Iraqi leader would lead to
a peaceful settlement.
   On Monday, crude oil prices plunged more than $5 a barrel based
on a combination of Middle East peace hopes and a rumor that Saddam
told his associates that Mohammed told him in a dream his rockets
were pointed in the wrong direction.
   The dream story first appeared in a Kuwaiti newspaper, now
published in the gulf, that has actively tried to discredit Saddam.
It was based on alleged rumors from Iraq.
   The peace hopes stemmed from a report on a speech by Saudi
Arabia's defense minister, Prince Sultan, that led traders to
believe his country was willing to make some concessions to Iraq.
   There were also ``unconfirmed reports'' that Iraq was
withdrawing troops from parts of Kuwait.
   On Wednesday, markets in Tokyo were briefly affected by a report
that fundamentalist Moslems in Jordan had allegedly declared war on
Israel.
   The rumor turned into gossip that Jordan had declared war on
Israel, which in turn had sent its troops across the Jordan River
and was squaring off against Iraq.
   Seymour said there are so many rumors it's impossible to keep
track of them. It's equally hard to find who starts them, even
though exchanges have penalties for members who engage in
rumor-mongering.
   ``The rumors appear and they have no parent,'' Seymour said.
``Everybody seems to plant rumors on Friday afternoon, just before
closing. That way you can really make hay.''
   Futures traders ``react to anything, whether it's a rumor or
real,'' he said. ``Those in the ... trading sections of big oil
companies tend to cover themselves by hedging.''
   Rumor or real, the gulf crisis makes for an active market.
   ``Basically, one thinks that the theoretical framework for it is
you take a price that the experts think the price would be if
there's no threat of war, say about $20 to $25 a barrel,'' Seymour
said. ``Anything above that would be a war premium.''
   ``Obviously all this feeds on rumors,'' he said.

<HEAD>Island Leaders, Uneasy Over Chemical Weapons, to See Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific island leaders meet with President Bush
on Saturday, worried that their ocean is becoming a U.S. chemical
weapons dump and their tiny nations are slipping down the list of
U.S. aid beneficiaries.
   Flying in from across the Pacific to confer with Bush are the
presidents or prime ministers of nine remote and economically
vulnerable countries, ranging from Papua New Guinea, population 3.6
million, to Nauru, a mid-ocean dot supporting 8,000 people.
   Bush, who arrives Friday, scheduled the unprecedented session to
coincide with a swing through Honolulu to campaign for Patricia
Saiki, a Republican congresswoman vying with Democratic incumbent
Daniel Akaka for a U.S. Senate seat.
   For months, Pacific islanders have expressed concern about plans
to destroy chemical weapons from U.S. Far Eastern and European
bases at a giant new incinerator on Johnston Atoll, a U.S.-held
ring of islands 825 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   As Bush and the Pacific leaders meet in two hours of talks,
followed by lunch, the latest shipment of such munitions will be
nearing Johnston Atoll.
   Two U.S. Navy ships carrying 100,000 artillery shells packed
with nerve agents, the U.S. Army's stockpile from West Germany, are
expected to reach the atoll next month.
   The South Pacific Forum, an organization of regional
governments, has complained the plan could make the region ``the
toxic waste disposal center of the world.''
   The environmental group Greenpeace USA went to court to block
the operation, but a federal judge last month rejected the
challenge.
   Tests of the incinerator are to end late next year, and
full-scale incineration is expected to begin in 1992. The United
States and Soviet Union have agreed to destroy such weapons by
1997.
   Geoffrey A. Henry, Cook Islands prime minister and chairman of
the Pacific Islands Conference, another regional organization, said
Johnston Atoll will be on their minds when he and the other leaders
meet with Bush.
   ``In my view, the top concern is the enviromental issue,'' Henry
said in a telephone interview.
   A U.S. administration official said in Washington on Wednesday
that islanders have been ``reassured that the destruction of these
chemical weapons will be carried out in an environmentally safe
manner.''
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Johnston Atoll and other environmental issues are expected to be a
major topic at the Honolulu talks.
   Island leaders also want the United States to sign the South
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, banning use, testing, dumping and
storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear waste in the region. The
Soviet Union, Australia and New Zealand are among the nations that
have signed the protocols.
   Besides the Cooks, Papua New Guinea and Nauru, the island
governments represented at the summit with Bush will be Fiji,
Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia,
Tuvalu and Western Samoa.
   The islanders may also seek reassurances from Bush on long-term
prospects for U.S. development assistance. They fear that the
budget crisis in Washington might mean cuts or even the elimination
of U.S. aid.
   ``Because they are mini-states, U.S. funds for them could get
squeezed out,'' said Michael P. Hamnett, a Pacific scholar at the
University of Hawaii.
   The aid programs, an estimated total of $16 million yearly for
the islands, could be reduced because of American commitments to
Eastern Europe, Central America and the Middle East, Henry said.
   ``We understand the rest of the world needs attention and we in
the Pacific have to learn to live with that,'' he said. ``Nothing
is happening in our region that requires the attention of the
United States.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Foe Says GOP Whip Neglecting His District</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JONESBORO, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Newt Gingrich hasn't set foot
in his congressional district all month. There are few Gingrich
campaign posters in his home town of Jonesboro. Gingrich says he's
been busy in Congress.
   All of that is fine with Democrat David Worley, who's been
campaigning against the House Republican whip full time for three
years.
   ``This district is tired of Mr. Gingrich,'' Worley says. ``He
forgot the average American in this district for his Washington
agenda, which does not serve the people here at home.''
   House Democrats are tired of their combative nemesis, too.
They've posted a sign in their Capitol cloakroom that says: ``Make
the 102nd (Congress) Newt Free.''
   The poster features Gingrich's photo and a caption calling him
``the most corrupt minority whip in history.'' That's a swipe at
his frequent descriptions of former House Speaker Jim Wright as the
``most corrupt speaker in American history.''
   Worley, a Jonesboro attorney, won 41 percent of the vote against
Gingrich in 1988. This time, he's accusing Gingrich of repeatedly
flip-flopping on taxes and neglecting the district.
   But Gingrich still retains a strong base of support in his
conservative Georgia district and is a heavy favorite for
re-election.
   Gingrich, who made his name as a fervent anti-tax crusader, last
visited his district on Sept. 29. He did find time for a quick
campaign trip to New Jersey this month for a GOP colleague.
   His spokesman, Tom Blankley, blames his absence from Georgia on
the fact that Congress ``has been in session just about non-stop
for weeks.''
   Political analyst Michael Binford said Gingrich must perform a
balancing act.
   ``One of the dangerous situations he's in is that if you're an
ambitious politician and have a national stage and forget the folks
back home, they can punish you for that,'' Binford said. ``He
hasn't ignored them, but he's not back here as much as before he
was made whip.''
   Because Gingrich is a controversial figure, he's ``not going to
breeze to victory as most incumbents do,'' said political scientist
Alan Abramowitz of Emory University. ``But it's really hard to
unseat an incumbent.''
   Gingrich was elected to the House on his third try in 1978. He
rose to the No. 2 spot in the House GOP hierarchy after instigating
the ethics investigation that led to Wright's resignation in 1989.
   But then Gingrich himself was attacked on ethics grounds
regarding the publishing deal for his 1984 book ``Window of
Opportunity.'' The House ethics committee said it found no basis
for a full investigation.
   Gingrich broke with the White House earlier this month when he
led the defeat of a budget proposal backed by President Bush.
   Worley, who also opposed the budget deal, says it was at least
the fourth time since July that Gingrich changed his tax position.
   In July, House Republicans approved a resolution opposing higher
taxes. A day later, Gingrich supported a $25 billion tax increase
and promised to use his leadership position to deliver key
Republican votes for it.
   But in early August, he said he opposed any tax increase. He
later advocated tax cuts to stimulate the economy, but his plan
died.
   In opposing the president's budget proposal, Gingrich said the
``equation has changed'' because of the Persian Gulf crisis and
increasing evidence that the country is headed for a recession.
   Worley, noting that Gingrich supported a $35,000 congressional
pay raise, offered his own budget plan: repeal the pay raise,
eliminate franked mail and increase income taxes on the wealthiest
Americans.
   Worley says Gingrich missed his most significant opportunity to
help the district when he refused to back federal intervention in
the Eastern Airlines strike. The district lost 6,000 jobs as a
result of the strike, according to Worley.
   Gingrich accuses Worley of being a ``liberal who voted for
Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis'' and of becoming a full-time
candidate instead of a tax-paying wage earner.
   Worley produced joint tax records proving he and his wife, also
a lawyer, had paid income taxes. He said it is true he has not
practiced law in the three years he has been campaigning against
Gingrich.
   Worley says he's no liberal. He supports the death penalty,
opposes gun control and favors a balanced budget amendment.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts Said to Delay Antimissile Decision by Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deep cuts in Star Wars spending in 1991 will
delay a White House decision on deploying an antimissile shield by
at least two years, the project's director says.
   Henry Cooper, who took over as head of the project just last
summer, has determined that because of the budget squeeze, he
cannot provide the scientific basis for a deployment decision
before the end of 1994 at the earliest.
   Shortly after he took office in 1989, Bush told the Pentagon he
wanted to be able to decide what kind of Star Wars defense to build
by the end of his term in 1992.
   Cooper's spokeswoman, Maj. Carolyn Channave, said Wednesday that
Cooper had reached this conclusion on the basis of the 1991 defense
bill approved on Wednesday by the House and expected to be passed
by the Senate this week. Cooper was not available for comment, she
said.
   The spending reduction of about $800 million, to a five-year low
of $2.89 billion, also is likely to mean the end of development
work on some of the exotic weapons that gave the Strategic Defense
Initiative its Star Wars nickname.
   One expected casualty is the free-electron laser, once
considered one of the most promising efforts to harness intense
beams of light for weaponry. The powerful laser would bounce its
beam off a series of orbiting mirrors to zap ballistic missiles
over the Soviet Union, destroying them moments after lift-off. More
than $700 million has been spent on this project over the past
seven years.
   The budget also may sound the death knell for the X-ray laser.
Powered by the detonation of a hydrogen bomb, the X-ray laser was
envisioned as firing multiple beams of radiation across space to
destroy Soviet missiles. Work on this weapon, which does not yet
exist, has cost about $1 billion in recent years.
   Bush had requested $4.6 billion for SDI for the 1991 budget year
that began Oct. 1. The decision by Congress to sharply reduce the
spending total does not mean the project is dead, but its pulse is
slowing and its shape is changing.
   SDI was launched by former President Reagan in March 1983 and
became a cornerstone of American defense policy. Reagan promoted
the project as a way of rendering nuclear weapons obsolete, but the
Bush administration has abandoned the idea of erecting an
impenetrable antimissile shield.
   Cooper disclosed earlier this month that he is restructuring SDI
to attempt to win congressional support for building a limited
defensive shield, one that could stop as many as a couple hundred
ballistic missiles but not protect against an all-out Soviet
nuclear attack - a threat most see as receding.
   Bush said earlier this year that strategic defense was more
important than ever before, but some of SDI's most fervent supports
are now wondering why the president didn't put up a bigger fight
against Congress' rush to cut Star Wars spending.
   Daniel O. Graham, a former director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency and chairman of the pro-SDI group Americans for the High
Frontier, said the 1991 defense budget deals a ``devastating blow''
to the project. He urged Bush to veto it.
   Bush is not expected to veto the bill, in part because Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said this week he would not recommend
rejection despite his misgivings on SDI spending.
   Equally troubling to Cooper, the SDI director, is a provision in
the bill that would, for the first time, give Congress control over
how the SDI money is spent. Cooper has said this will limit his
ability to apply technologies developed in one area of the project
- such as space-based interceptors - to other areas.

<TEXT>
   The confrontation of multinational forces
in Saudi Arabia with Iraq in occupied Kuwait has the makings of the
largest tank battle since the classic World War II struggle at
Kursk on the Russian Front.
   Several thousand German and Russian tanks fought in that epic
1943 battle, a Russian victory that marked the German ebb on the
Eastern Front.
   Iraq has about 430,000 troops in Kuwait, bolstered by an
estimated 3,500 Soviet-designed tanks, ranging from the aging T-54
to the more advanced T-72.
   They face more than 300,000 troops in the U.S.-led multinational
force with a tank strength expected to reach 1,800 by the end of
the month.
   This month marks the anniversaries of two other famous tank
battles that helped change the course of wars - El Alamein in the
Egyptian desert in 1942 and Israel's armored thrust against the
Egyptians across the Suez Canal in the 1973 Yom Kippur conflict.
   The British victory at El Alamein, in which several hundred
tanks on both sides were deployed, turned the tide against Adolf
Hitler in the Middle East. That epic battle pitted British Gen.
Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army against the vaunted Afrika Korps
of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the ``Desert Fox.''
   The British 7th Armored Brigade, the successors of Montgomery's
7th Armored Division known as the ``Desert Rats,'' are now
deploying in Saudi Arabia with their Challenger 1 tanks.
   The tanks may now be high-tech leviathans, but the tactics
differ little from those used back in World War II, veterans of
desert tank warfare say.
   October is also the anniversary of the 1973 Middle East war, in
which Israeli armored columns crossed the Suez Canal and encircled
the entire Egyptian 3rd Army in a classic tank operation.
   An estimated 1,200 Israeli and Egyptians tanks were involved.
   The men who fought in El Alamein and the 1973 conflict say one
constant factor in desert tank warfare is the need for air power.
   ``When Montgomery took over, the first thing he did was to move
Royal Air Force headquarters alongside his own headquarters,'' said
retired British Army Col. Michael Jeffery, who fought in the
Western Desert campaigns.
   ``If you've got air superiority, you have freedom of action, and
to attack the supply lines, which is also important. At El Alamein
it was complete air superiority,'' he recalled.
   Zev Eitan, who served in Israel's tank forces in the 1948, 1956,
1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars and a veteran of the Suez tank
battle, noted: ``In 1967 ... once we had mastery of the sky our air
force could help and we just had to follow to exploit the success
of the air force.''
   Air superiority was also important in the 1973 war, ``since in
the desert you don't have so much cover,'' he said.
   Eitan was a battalion commander in the 1973 conflict and is now
a consultant at Israel's Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies.
   The Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein are deployed in defensive
positions behind a shield of anti-tank ditches, earthworks and
minefields.
   The Iraqis are master military engineers, whose dig-in tactics
were perfected during their 1980-88 war with neighboring Iran.
   For most of that war, however, Iraqi tanks were used in a static
role as artillery rather than in the running battles that Western
forces are trained to fight.
   Tanks of the multinational force include U.S.-built M60s and the
top-of-the-line Abrams tank in several configurations, as well as
the Desert Rats' up-to-date British Challenger tanks.
   The multinational force tanks are generally far more advanced
than those of the Iraqis, whose T-54 is based on a 1947 Soviet
model.
   ``Technology makes a vast difference,'' said Jeffery. ``Ours is
better than Saddam's.''
   Providing air cover for the the multinational force tanks are
hundreds of ground-attack jets and tank-killer helicopters.
   Iraq also has hundreds of ground-attack jets and attack
helicopters, but it is unclear how many could be used for armor
support operations.
   Since Iraq has a two-to-one edge in tanks, another major factor
- especially in an area where resupply is problematic - is
retaining control of the battlefield once the running clash of
steel has subsided.
   ``This is important in armored warfare, because not all tanks
hit are a total loss,'' said Eitan. ``If you remain in control of
the battlefield you can repair some of your tank casualties.''

<TEXT>
   Two attacks on key military
garrisons appear to signal the beginning of a major rebel
offensive, but it might not be the sort of onslaught the guerrillas
initiated out last year.
   Residents of the capital have been on edge since the end of the
rainy season, the period starting in the fall when most guerrilla
offensives have begun during the 11-year-old civil war.
   Last November, guerrillas mounted an assault in parts of the
capital that continued for three weeks and was their biggest
offensive of the war.
   Military and rebel sources indicate the pattern of this year's
attacks might be different.
   Instead of entrenching themselves in densely populated
neighborhoods, the guerrillas plan an escalating series of
hit-and-run attacks on selected military targets, the sources say.
   A more sustained effort to rout the armed forces might follow
the attacks, the sources say.
   The new rebel campaign opened with a thunderous 20-minute mortar
barrage early Oct. 17 on the main air force base at Ilopango, on
the city's eastern edge.
   Nearly two hours of combat between paratroopers and retreating
rebels ensued. The firefight struck panic in residents of the
eastern neighborhoods, where the fighting in last year's offensive
was fiercest.
   But by dawn the zone had returned to relative normalcy.
   The attack on Ilopango left five soldiers wounded and damaged
six helicopters, according to the air force. The rebel Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front said it had damaged 24 helicopters.
   The capital was rattled again Tuesday afternoon by two powerful
explosions - a botched guerrilla attack on the military compound in
the city's southern sector that houses the Defense Ministry and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Both homemade mortar rounds fell some 150 yards short of their
target, onto a private house. The mortars killed two children and
wounded three adults.
   Rumors of an offensive have been circulating since July. The
army has been on a high state of alert for months, cancelling
leaves, stepping up patrols, beefing up base security and setting
up new checkpoints and roadblocks.
   Hours before the attack on Ilopango, the defense minister, Col.
Rene Emilio Ponce said in a televised interview: ``We have good
information that they (the rebels) are indeed preparing an
offensive of a type different from that of last year. According to
our information, it is going to be more selective and will involve
more firepower.''
   FMLN leaders say the offensive is aimed at spurring talks to end
the war.
   ``It will be necessary to carry out extraordinary military
operations, to increase the level of military action in order to
give impetus to peace negotiations,'' said Salvador Samayoa, an
FMLN leader, said last week.
   Representatives of the rightist government of President Alfredo
Cristiani and the FMLN have held five rounds of peace talks since
May. The talks, scheduled to resume Nov. 4 in Mexico, have bogged
down over bitterly differing positions on the future role of the
armed forces.
   In an effort to force both sides to the bargaining table, the
U.S. Senate voted Friday to halve the $85 million aid package to El
Salvador's military and promised to cut aid altogether if the
government withdrew from peace talks.
   If the rebelsfail to demonstrate good faith in negotiations -
or launch a major offensive - the slashed $42.5 million would be
restored.
   An earlier version of the bill would have restored the aid if
the rebels refused a government offer for a cease-fire, but it was
rejected.
   The rebels say there is no point in a cease-fire until
negotiations have achieved major changes in Salvadoran society.
   They want a drastic purge and reduction of the armed forces in
exchange for their own demoblization.
   The government says it will not agree to measures that undermine
the armed forces' integrity, and insists that the military do any
housecleaning it deems necessary.

   Three high-ranking women in the Bush
administration and a House member are among the names being
mentioned as possible successors to Elizabeth Dole as secretary of
labor.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, became the first of President Bush's Cabinet
secretaries to depart when she resigned Wednesday to become
president of the American Red Cross.
   The White House said it had not settled on a possible nominee or
talked to any of the likely contenders.
   ``We continue to look at candidates and consider people and
search for the best person,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   One person frequently mentioned is Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.,
should she lose her bid to oust Democratic Sen. Paul Simon in the
Nov. 6 election.
   Asked if Martin was on the list, Fitzwater replied,
``Everybody's on the list.''
   Other possible contenders that consistently come up are:
Constance Newman, head of the Office of Personnel Management;
Elaine Chao, who holds the No. 2 job at the Transportation
Department; and Constance Horner, undersecretary of health and
human services. Horner also served as OPM director under former
President Reagan.
   Observers speculated that if Newman, who oversees the
government's 2.4-million-member workforce, were to get the nod,
Bush might look to Social Security Administrator Gwen King to
replace her at OPM. That would allow the administration to promote
two black women at the same time.
   A Labor Department aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said officials did not expect Bush to name a successor at least
until after Election Day. That way, if a loyal Republican making a
bid for higher office lost, the president could reward him or her
with a Cabinet job, the aide said.
   In addition, officials noted there was no rush to fill the job
because Mrs. Dole will remain on the job until Nov. 23. In
addition, if Congress adjourns this week as scheduled, the Senate -
which must confirm any Cabinet secretary - wouldn't be back until
January to give its approval, anyway.
   At a White House news conference Wednesday, Mrs. Dole said the
choice of her successor was ``up to the president ... What the
president and I have discussed, I think, has to remain between the
two of us.''
   Mrs. Dole, who is the highest-ranking woman in the
administration, said that after 25 years of government service, she
was looking forward to focusing on humanitarian causes at her new
job at the American Red Cross.
   She denied she had been frozen out by White House policymakers.
Aides and union leaders have said she had little clout at Bush's
Cabinet table, and many labor policy decisions were left to
presidential chief of staff John Sununu.
   ``I can't imagine who was saying this ... Most definitely, I
feel very much a part of the circle that's making the decisions
here at the White House,'' Mrs. Dole said after announcing her
resignation with the president at her side.
   Later, in an interview, Mrs. Dole testily labeled those reports
``totally erroneous.''
   ``It's been a wonderful relationship,'' she said of her ties to
White House aides.
   She said such officials as Sununu and budget director Richard
Darman naturally have a close working relationship with the
president. ``But my issues, obviously, I'm the one carrying the
ball, I'm the one developing the strategy,' she said.
   Mrs. Dole, wife of Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
also denied that she might use the $185,000-a-year Red Cross
position to lay the groundwork for long-term political goals.
   ``I'm on my way to the Red Cross. I have no plans to run for
anything,'' she said. Rumors have been rampant that she would
eventually step down to run in 1992 for the Senate seat now held by
Democrat Terry Sanford of her native North Carolina.
   In the interview, she did not rule out some future bid for
elective office, saying, ``You learn in this town never to say
never.''

<HEAD>NFU Says Study Shows Farm Bill Will Cut Income</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Daryll in 2nd graf correct</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study finds that farmers will be in for
some harder times under the 1990 farm bill, the National Farmers
Union says.
   The analysis by economist Daryll Ray of Oklahoma State
University shows that a farmer with a 350-acre wheat base and a net
income of $15,787 in 1990 could see income drop more than $1,000 in
1991, based on current prices and costs.
   By 1995, the fifth year of the new farm bill, the annual
reduction in net income from current levels would be nearly $4,000,
according to the study distributed Wednesday by the farm
organization.
   The reduction in net income would result mostly from provisions
in the legislation that reduce the amount of acreage eligible for
government deficiency payments.
   Those are subsidies to make up the difference between market
prices and target levels. The acreage cuts involved a ``triple
base'' option so farmers can plant what they choose on that
acreage. Those crops, however, are not eligible for deficiency
payments.
   Specific cuts in the commodity programs were provided in the
farm bill but were also tied to the passage of the budget-reduction
measure that is aimed at cutting federal spending by $500 billion
over the next five years.
   The Agriculture Department's share of that reduction is $13.6
billion and includes the cutbacks in commodity price support
operations cited in the study circulated by the National Farmers
Union.
   ``I don't know how anybody who purports to represent farmers -
be they in Congress, in the administration or in farm and commodity
organizations - could support this farm bill,'' NFU President
Leland Swenson said in a statement. ``It will absolutely devastate
rural America, and these numbers show the unfair share of budget
cuts farmers would shoulder.''
   In all, according to the NFU, deficit reduction may cost the
average taxpayer as much as $100 to $300 per year. But farmers, who
also are taxpayers, may end up contributing many times those
amounts because of reduced income.
   Most farm organizations have been saying all along that the
$13.6 billion reduction in USDA programs over five years will mean
reductions in net farm income.
   The National Farmers Organization, for example, said last week
that the low-price policies advocated by the Bush administration
were bargaining tools in the current negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   NFO President DeVon R. Woodland said the drive by the
administration to get the European Community to go along with
subsidy cutbacks will fail and that Congress will have to
reconsider the farm bill after the GATT talks end on Dec. 31.
   The National Grange has said the $13.6 billion cut ordered for
USDA programs represented ``unilateral disarmament'' by the United
States in the trade talks. The Grange's national master, Robert
Barrow, said the costs of trimming the budget deficit should be
borne more equitably.
   Rob Nooter of the American Farm Bureau Federation's Washington
office said Wednesday that the farm bill and its tie to the $500
billion budget-reduction package is ``certainly going to have an
impact on farm income.''
   Some of the income lost from reduced deficiency payments will be
made up by other features of the 1990 farm bill, but not all of it,
he said.
   Federation President Dean Kleckner said last week that he wasn't
happy with all of the farm bill but urged its adoption.
   ``Although farm program budget cuts are disproportionate, and we
accept them with great reluctance, the bill will continue
agricultural market orientation and give farmers greater planting
flexibility,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The 1990 farm law will be a prime topic of
discussion as the Agriculture Department unlimbers its annual
outlook conference next month.
   It will be the 67th USDA meeting for economists, farm leaders,
commodity experts and others to look at what may be forthcoming in
the year ahead. This year's session is Nov. 27-29.
   The opening day will include talks by Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleberger, conference officials said Wednesday.
   They will be followed by Sidney L. Jones, assistant secretary of
the treasury for economic policy, who will present the economic
outlook for 1991. USDA officials will discuss prospects for
farmers, consumers and agricultural exports.
   Other first-day events will include a panel discussion on
European and Soviet Union affairs.
   Commodity prospects and the outlok under new farm legislation
will be highlights during the remainder of the conference, along
with environmental and energy issues.
   Among the forecasts will be USDA's first for consumer food
prices in 1991, and its predictions for exports and farm income.
   The impact of higher oil prices will be a major factor in the
1991 farm income forecast. Energy also will be important in looking
ahead at retail food prices.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Production of farm-raised catfish dropped 9
percent last month from a year earlier to 27.6 million pounds,
according to a monthly report by the Agriculture Department.
   However, the report said the average price paid by processors to
growers in September was 78 cents per pound, up 13 cents from a
year ago.
   On a cumulative basis, catfish farmers delivered about 277.8
million pounds of catfish to processors through September, compared
with 255.3 million pounds in the same nine months of 1989.
   Imports of freshwater catfish, mostly from Brazil, are down from
a year ago. The report said imports in August, the most recent
month calculated, totaled 362,000 pounds, down 14 percent from a
year earlier.

<HEAD>GOP Situation Looks Tough; Bush Being Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are bracing themselves for
Election Day losses and conservatives are ready to lay the blame at
the feet of President Bush.
   With less than two weeks remaining before the polls open,
polling data from a wide range of states points to growing support
for Democratic candidates.
   ``A month ago I would have said we were going to win one or two
seats in the Senate,'' said David Keene, a Republican political
consultant and conservative activist. ``I think now we're going to
lose two and it could be more.''
   Keene also predicted Wednesday that GOP losses in the House
``would be a lot worse than anybody thought.'' And, he said, ``it's
traceable to one person and that's the president of the United
States.''
   Lyn Nofziger, White House political director during the Reagan
administration, said he thought the election was breaking for the
Democrats and that one problem was that ``if I'm an independent
voter, if I'm not a party erson, George Bush hasn't given me much
reason to go out and support his party.''
   Going into the election, Democrats control the Senate by a
margin of 55-45 and the House by 258-176. Republicans had hoped to
trim the Senate margin and hold their House losses to fewer than 10
seats.
   But the budget negotiations proved a disaster for Republicans.
Conservatives rebelled against Bush's decision to drop his
hard-line opposition to any tax increases and helped defeat a
compromise package worked out between the White House and the
congressional leadership.
   Then the president appeared unable to make up his mind on
whether he would or would not agree to increasing the tax load on
the rich.
   While all that was happening, the Democrats succeeded in
reinforcing a public perception of the Republicans as the party
that cared more about the wealthy than the middle class.
   Douglas Bailey, a Republican media consultant, called the
long-running budget negotiations ``a mild form of disaster for
Republicans.''
   ``The president's image is awful,'' said Bailey. ``The president
does not look in charge.''
   ``There does seem to be a marked movement toward the Democratic
Party, largely because of the fairness issue,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa.
   In a recent Newsweek poll, 65 percent of the people said they
thought Bush was ``more concerned about wealthy Americans than he
should be.''
   ``In the last 10 days Republicans have taken a nosedive,'' said
Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who believed the Republicans should hold
to a hard line against tax increases.
   ``It's not possible for the Republican Party to win the public
relations battle over fairness,'' said Weber. ``People are inclined
to believe that the Republican Party is the party of the rich more
than the Democratic Party.''
   The Minnesota congressman said that ``my advice to every
Republican candidate is to get back to Republican basics.''
   The White House showed some displeasure Wednesday at the growing
tendency, an almost frantic scramble, by Republican candidates to
put some distance between themselves and the president.
   ``If they can sleep with their conscience, let them try,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Poll results that have Republicans nervous include these:
   -In Oregon, Democrat Harry Lonsdale leads Sen. Mark Hatfield 50
to 44 percent in a survey conducted late last week. A new survey in
the governor's race has Democrat Barbara Roberts taking a
four-point lead over Republican Dave Frohnmayer. Bidding for a
fifth Senate term, Hatfield got 67 percent of the vote six years
ago. Lonsdale, a wealthy businessman, began the race as a virtually
unknown long-shot.
   -In Minnesota, a new poll shows Democrat Paul Wellstone pulling
to within 3 points of Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, who began the campaign
rated one of the safe Republicans. Boschwitz aides insist their
internal polls say it isn't that close.
   -Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was looking like a possible
victim of virulent anti-incumbent sentiment, holds a 14-point lead
over Republican challenger Jim Rappaport. The race was a dead heat
in polls two weeks ago.
   -Also in Massachusetts, a new survey puts Democrat John Silber
six points ahead of Republican William Weld in the race for
governor.
   -In Ohio, Democrat Tony Celebrezze said an internal poll shows
him leading Republican George Voinovich in the race for governor.
Independent polls have said Voinovich was holding a double-digit
lead through most of the race.
   -Democrat Harvey Gantt continues to lead Republican Sen. Jesse
Helms in North Carolina. The latest survey put Gantt's lead at
eight points.

   What has kept Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward
married for 32 years? Eternal love? Undying affection?
   Try sheer luck.
   The Newmans, breaking a policy of not talking about their
marriage, told Parade magazine they don't know why they've stayed
together.
   ``Our marriage hasn't been a bed of roses,'' Newman said in the
magazine's Oct. 28 issue. ``Sometimes you get terminally irritated,
and at one point I just packed up and left.''
   Asked why she thought their marriage had lasted, Woodward said:
``I have no idea. Absolutely not one single idea onthe subject.
Probably sheer luck.''
   And what about the time Newman packed up and left?
   ``I was gone about 15 minutes,'' Newman said. ``And I stopped
and thought to myself, `What the hell am I doing? I have no place
to go!' And I turned around and came right back. Joanne's right.
She said it. What we've got is sheer luck!''

   ``I just plain go out for about 40 minutes and then come back in

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - David Cassidy still sports the long, shaggy
hairdo of Keith Partridge - plus a few gray hairs - but wants to
shed his old teeny-bopper image with a comeback album.
   The former star of television's ``The Partridge Family'' would
just as soon forget such early-'70s pop hits as ``I Think I Love
You.'' He said he hopes listeners will see his serious side with
his new album, ``David Cassidy.''
   ``I was really naive enough to think people won't assume the
music I'm playing on the show and that light, fluffy sort of
airhead character was really me,'' he said Wednesday.
   After leaving songwriting and television, Cassidy raised
racehorses and worked in theater after a few solo album failures.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - James Michener says he plans to keep
on writing five hours a day while he spends his winters teaching
and taking part in a college program for 216 retired professionals
and their spouses.
   The author said Wednesday that he and his wife, Mari, have
settled on the Academy of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College in
which to pass their time from October to February. They had looked
at about 40 possibilities.
   ``It's what people my age look for,'' said Michener, 83. ``We
know a mere quiescent retirement is quite often fatal. ... I try to
keep my mind active.''
   The author of such novels as ``Hawaii,'' ``Chesapeake,''
``Centennial'' and ``Texas'' announced earlier this year he had
written his last big book.
   The Micheners plan to live from February until mid-May at the
University of Texas at Austin, where he is professor emeritus. The
rest of the year they will spend at Brunswick, Maine.

   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) - Game show host Bob Barker and an
animal rights group want people to boycott a film in which horses
jump from a 10-foot platform into an 11-foot-deep tank of water.
   ``Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken,'' which is being filmed here, is
about a woman who jumped into the ocean on horseback from a pier at
Atlantic City, N.J., during the 1930s.
   Lou Phillips, production executive for the movie, said producers
have gone beyond American Humane Association standards in the care
of the horses, and no injuries have been reported.
   The jump ``may be acceptable to the producers, may be acceptable
to the association, but if the horses could speak, I'd bet it would
not be acceptable to them,'' Barker said Tuesday.
   Barker, a longtime animal rights activist, works with the
Coalition to Protect Animals in Entertainment.
   Since forming in 1987, the coalition has called for the boycott
of 10 movies, including ``Project X,'' ``The Bear,'' ``Young Guns
II'' and ``Days of Thunder.''

<HEAD>Scientist Reinstated At EPA After Disclosure Of Tobacco Lobbying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-smoking group praised the Environmental
Protection Agency for reinstating a scientist who had been
dismissed from an advisory panel under pressure from the tobacco
industry.
   The EPA said Wednesday that Dr. David Burns of the University of
California at San Diego had been reinstated to a panel on the
health effects of others' smoke.
   Mark Pertschuk, executive director of Americans for Nonsmokers'
Rights in Berkeley, Calif., said he was delighted with the
decision.
   ``I think it was the only ethical thing at this point that they
could do,'' he said. ``To have given in to the tobacco industry
would have been a horrible statement about the impartiality of the
peer review process.''
   But an industry spokeswoman complained that Burns' reinstatement
would endanger the panel's ability to do its work fairly.
   ``David Burns cannot be considered to be an objective party in
this issue and that is very well documented,'' said Tobacco
Institute spokeswoman Brennan Dawson. ``We have a panelist that
doesn't belong.''
   Burns said he was pleased by the turn of events.
   ``I think it reflects the EPA reconsidering the importance of
the public policy decision they were making,'' he said.
   ``I think that the information they received from the press and
the scientific community was that there was a tremendous concern
about the influence of the tobacco industry on this kind of
scientific panel.''
   Burns has worked on the Surgeon General's reports on the dangers
of smoking since the 1970s. He was editor of the 1986 report on
passive smoking.
   He was dismissed recently from a panel chosen to review two
forthcoming EPA reports on the health effects of second-hand
cigarette smoke.
   The tobacco industry and Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., a tobacco
industry ally, had lobbied vigorously to remove Burns from the
committee of the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board, a standing group
of independent experts.
   Steven Bayard, manager of the EPA's project on passive smoking,
said he had never such a response to industry pressure in his 12
years at the EPA.
   After the success of the tobacco industry's lobbying effort was
disclosed last week, Donald Barnes, the Scientific Advisory Board's
staff director, asked the board's executive committee to advise him
on whether to reappoint Burns, according to EPA officials who spoke
on condition they not be named.
   The executive committee voted unanimously to reinstate Burns,
the officials said.
   Barnes did not return telephone calls to his office.
   Burns was originally told on Aug. 10 that he had been appointed
to the panel, and had received drafts of the passive smoking
reports before his ouster. The panel's job is to review the reports
to assure their scientific accuracy.
   The Tobacco Institute wrote EPA Administrator William Reilly on
Aug. 10 protesting Burns' selection.
   ``Frankly, we are mystified how an individual with Dr. Burns'
long and intense involvement with the anti-smoking movement can be
expected to contribute to a reasonable, objective examination,''
the letter said.
   Bliley didn't mention Burns by name in his letter to the EPA on
Sept. 18 but said the panel should ``consist of qualified
individuals who have not already prejudged this issue in any
manner.'' EPA officials said they understood that to be an
objection to Burns.

   Civil rights forces plan a fresh fight next
year for the job discrimination bill that President Bush vetoed on
grounds it would result in hiring quotas.
   ``Like MacArthur, we shall return ... and we expect to win,''
civil rights leader Benjamin Hooks said Wednesday after the Senate
sustained the veto by a one-vote margin.
   Eleven Republicans joined 55 Democrats as the Senate voted 66-34
for the override. It thus fell one vote short of the two-thirds
needed to enact the bill despite the president's objections.
   It was Bush's 16th veto in 21 months as president. He has been
sustained in all 11 override attempts by Congress.
   Hooks, president of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, said the bill as introduced next year would be
similar or identical to the 1990 version.
   Six Supreme Court decisions that caused a furor when they were
handed down last year would be negated under the bill.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme discrimination
cases.
   Bush said he wanted to sign a civil rights bill and was willing
to go along with a ban on harassment along with other provisions.
But he would not agree to intricate features that would make it
easier to win race and sex discrimination cases against employers.
   He said they were so stringent that employers would turn to
quota hiring to provide themselves with a ready-made defense if
sued for discrimination.
   Sponsors denied to the end that the bill would result in quotas.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called the quota argument ``a
sham.''
   ``The president has taken the low road on civil rights, but that
is no reason for the Senate to take it, too,'' Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., said in a last-ditch appeal for support.
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the bill would
enable ``lawyers to reap huge profits in the name of racial
justice'' and result in ``quotas, quotas, quotas and more
employment quotas.''
   Republican critics of the bill expressed dismay that they were
not able to vote on a more moderate measure. But they said the bill
vetoed by Bush would go too far.
   ``It swings the pendulum too far against employers and in favor
of employees,'' said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a supporter of the bill, suggested
that a vote to sustain Bush could unseat some senators up for
re-election.
   And Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., suggested the president could
persuade voters his veto was a necessity. ``If he can't convince
people it is a quota bill, then I think it's a loser for him,''
Packwood said.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said it as ``a political move to try
to get to conservative, Democratic, blue-collar workers. I think
it's Bush listening to his political advisers, and shame on him. It
was a cold political decision.''
   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, a Republican state
legislator in Louisiana, watched the proceedings from a front-row
seat in the Senate visitor's gallery.
   Duke, who this month lost his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, told
reporters he was opposed to the bill because it would
``discriminate against qualified white Americans.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Duke's
appearance ``has nothing to do with us. We disavow David Duke in
every way, shape or form. Absolutely.''

<HEAD>House Approves Volunteer Service Bill Despite Complaints Over Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is sending President Bush a bill
calling for $287 million in new spending to encourage volunteerism
and community service, turning aside complaints about the cost.
   Bush is expected to sign the legislation, its House and Senate
sponsors say.
   The compromise National and Community Service Act passed the
House on a 235-186 vote Wednesday. The Senate approved the
agreement last week after it emerged from a congressional
conference committee.
   ``This bill, at least for now, signals a change from the `Me
Generation' of the 1980s to a community service ethic I hope will
pervade America in the 1990s,'' said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   Republicans attacked the bill as unwarranted and wasteful
spending at a time when Congress was struggling with a bill to
raise taxes.
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said Congress was wrong to authorize
such new spending when budget constraints have prevented it from
fully funding existing programs for children and the poor.
   ``Has the Congress of the United States gone bonkers?'' asked
Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.
   ``People wonder why the American public is upset with the
Congress,'' he said. ``I'll tell you why they're upset - because
they don't understand this kind of drunkenness with new bureaucracy
and new spending.''
   Only 22 Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the bill; 41
Democrats opposed it.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., praised the bill as ``a call to
action for the nation.'' John Buchanan, head of the liberal group
People for the American Way, commended Bush's support for the
measure and said not since John Kennedy has a president championed
community service as Bush has.
   The bill authorizes spending $62 million in the current fiscal
year, $105 million in fiscal 1992 and $120 million in fiscal 1993
for national and community service programs.
   A part of the measure is a $5 million authorization to begin a
Thousand Points of Light Foundation to encourage volunteerism,
taking its name from Bush's phrase for volunteers.
   Among the key elements:
   -A new part-time program encouraging community service by young
people, established through schools and community organizations
such as the YMCA or the United Way. It would encourage adults to
volunteer in schools and community-based service programs.
   Money would go in grants to state education agencies, which
would distribute it to schools and service groups.
   -An expansion of youth corps programs to increase fulltime
service opportunities. Young people would be put in teams to work
on projects cleaning the environment, helping the hungry and
homeless and aiding the poor. Some 60 conservation or youth corps
programs now are operating locally.
   -A program to encourage colleges to make community service
programs available to their students.
   -A greatly reduced version of a civilian national service corps
proposed two years ago by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Charles Robb,
D-Va. A test program would provide $5,000 in education assistance
in return for a year's full-time service at a subsistence wage.
Also available would be $1,000 for education or home down payment
in exchange for a year of part-time civilian service, to be matched
by another $1,000 from the state.

<HEAD>Architects of Korean War Memorial Say Government Ruined Design</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four architects who won a $20,000 contest to
design a Korean War veterans' memorial saw the government turn the
plan into a battle scene that glorifies war, their lawyer says.
   ``Architects have to have some faith that when they enter a
design competition and win, then that's what it's going to be,''
attorney Robert Sokolove said in an interview Wednesday. ``You
can't change the rules in the middle.''
   Particularly galling to the architects is that the new version
depicts soldiers in battle-ready positions, Sokolove said. The
original plan called for ``a dream-like'' collection of 38 soldiers
moving, some unevenly, across a remote landscape toward an American
flag.
   The architects are fighting to have the original design
restored. Sokolove said he learned of the changes two months ago
when they were presented by a Washington architectural firm that he
thought had been retained only to implement the earlier plans.
   But Col. William Ryan, director of operations and finance for
the American Battle Monuments Commission, said Wednesday that the
new model ``is so far superior to the other design, it's
unbelievable.'' The commission erects and maintains memorials
honoring American soldiers.
   The new design retains the essential elements of the old one,
adding a pool, pathways and benches and cutting back bushes - all
to accommodate large numbers of visitors, Ryan said.
   Sokolove said the new, circular pathways ``look like an I-95
interchange.''
   He represents four Pennsylvania State University architects who
beat out 1,018 competitors last year to design the memorial across
the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial.
   President Bush was the guest of honor as a one-eighth scale
model was unveiled at the White House on June 14, 1989. The entry
was declared the winner of a $20,000 prize by a jury of Korean War
veterans.
   The soldiers were to show ``the experience of moving into and
through war,'' according to the architects' original design
statement.
   But the redesign ``no longer alludes to the struggle and
sacrifice of walking a hostile landscape, but instead glorifies
war'' by depicting a battle, said a statement delivered by the
architects to President Bush's aides last month.
   The changes were ordered by the National Capital Planning
Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and the Interior
Department, Ryan said. Also playing a role in the final design, he
said, were Korean War veterans serving on the panel that selected
the design.
   ``The main thing is the 38 heroic statues of ground combat
personnel. They're still there,'' Ryan said. He said the final
design was submitted by the Cooper-Lecky architectural firm of
Washington.
   Sokolove said the government was still using a photograph of the
original design to raise funds for the project. But Ryan said that
is only because photos of the new model are not ready.
   Originally budgeted at $6 million, the memorial is now expected
to cost $14.9 million, according to Ryan. Organizers hope to have a
dedication in 1993.
   Some 5.7 million Americans served in Korea during the 1950-53
conflict, and more than 54,000 were killed.
   The controversy recalls the designing of the Vietnam War
memorial. A vocal group backed by then-Interior Secretary James
Watt opposed the 1982 design as unheroic. The group won a
concession when a statue of three soldiers was added in 1984 near
the V-shaped wall bearing the names of more than 58,000 Americans
killed in the war.

<HEAD>Congressman Resigns; Faced Second Sexual Misconduct Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald E. Lukens' final days in Congress were
spent out of public view, on the telephone with people urging him
to resign rather than face a second sexual misconduct
investigation.
   He didn't appear at the House on Tuesday or Wednesday. He
slipped out of his congressional office Monday, before the House
ethics committee announced it had reopened his case because of a
new complaint that he sexually harassed a Capitol elevator
operator.
   Lukens' last official action was a letter of resignation
transmitted to Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste shortly after 11:30 a.m.
Wednesday:
   ``Effective immediately, for the good of the Congress and the
integrity of the institution, I resign my seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives. Sincerely, Buz.''
   A top aide said Lukens stayed away from Capitol Hill but kept in
contact with supporters, staff, his attorney and party leaders via
telephone.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel was among those who
convinced Lukens, defeated for renomination in Ohio's May primary,
that he faced an expulsion vote unless he stepped down.
   Ethics committee spokeswoman Jan Keyes said Lukens would not
have lost his retirement benefits even if he had been expelled.
   Lukens will qualify for a pension of more than $2,000 a month
beginning in 1993. Under the federal pension system, his payment is
determined by combining his congressional service with his 6{ years
in the Air Force and two years on a congressional staff.
   Lukens resigned two days after the ethics committee revived its
dormant case against him to include the new accusation that he
fondled a House elevator operator earlier this month.
   A source who spoke with the elevator operator said she alleged
that Lukens approached her more than once on the same day. After
fondling her, Lukens gave the woman his business card and asked her
to call him, the source said.
   The elevator operator reported the incident to her superiors.
   She was given leave with pay and assured she would not have to
return to work as long as Lukens was around the Capitol, said the
source, who requested anonymity.
   The ethics committee earlier had been examining whether Lukens
had violated House rules by having sex with a 16-year-old girl - an
episode that led to a misdemeanor conviction in Ohio last year.
   The 59-year-old congressman, who is divorced, has been free on
bond while appealing to the state Supreme Court.
   Lukens' office operations will continue until his successor is
chosen.
   Ohio law requires the governor to call a special election, even
though only 10 weeks remain in his term. A primary must be held if
more than candidate in a party files nominating petitions.
   The two men vying to replace Lukens both indicated they'll run
in the special election. Republican nominee John Boehner is viewed
as having the edge over Democrat Gregory Jolivette.
   If the same candidate wins both the special election and the
Nov. 6 vote, he would get a leg up on the House freshman class of
1991. Office space, for instance, is determined by seniority. Thus,
someone who takes office in November would be ahead of those who
arrive in January.
   Party leaders pressed Lukens for more than a year to resign, but
he ignored them. They largely reacted with relief Wednesday.
   ``I'm just sorry it took so long to do the right thing by the
people of the 8th District,'' said Ohio GOP Chairman Robert
Bennett.
   ``I think he was wrong to remain in office,'' said Donald
Birgel, a party official from Lukens' home base, Butler County,
Ohio. ``It was selfish of him.''
   Lukens served in Congress from 1967 to 1970, when he made an
unsuccessful attempt to gain the Republican gubernatorial
nomination in Ohio. After 15 years in the state Senate, he returned
to Congress in 1986.
   He was diagnosed as having throat cancer in 1984 and was given
just weks to live, but battled back and successfully ran for
Congress two years later.

<HEAD>Congress Curbs Rebel Aid in Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is beginning a gradual winding down
of U.S. support for covert conflicts in the Third World with an
intelligence bill that curbs money flowing to rebels in
Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola.
   On a voice vote, the House on Wednesday gave its endorsement to
the compromise bill, which provides roughly $30 billion for
intelligence activities around the globe and institutes reforms
growing out of the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Senate followed suit early today, sending the bill to
President Bush. Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said that while Bush
does not like parts of the measure, he may ``hold his nose and let
the bill become law.''
   On the covert paramilitary conflicts, the bill reflected a
growing congressional skepticism about such expensive and thorny
involvements, and the evaporation of U.S.-Soviet tensions that was
the rationale for an American role.
   According to sources familiar with the bill, and to limited
sections made public, it:
   -Provides that U.S. covert weapons supplies to the UNITA rebels
in Angola could be suspended if the Marxist government in Luanda
agrees to free elections and a cease-fire, and the Soviet Union
halts its own weapons shipments to the government. It would be up
to the president to decide whether those conditions have been met.
   The provision was a scaled-back version of restrictions that had
been adopted by the House during an unusual public debate last week
on the aid program, which is technically secret.
   Half of the lethal aid would be put into a restricted account
subject to release only on approval of the congressional
intelligence committees. Weapons aid represents roughly half the
$60 million annual U.S. support for the rebels.
   -Suspends the covert aid program to non-communist rebels
fighting the Moscow-backed government of Cambodia. The program,
which sources say amounts to about $13 million, will be phased out
early in 1991 and converted into an open program of humanitarian
aid to the rebels and to other Cambodians.
   Lawmakers are worried that aid to the rebels is finding its way
to the infamous Khmer Rouge, who were responsible for the killings
ofmmore than a million Cambodians during their rule in the late
1970s. The country's warring parties are working with the United
Nations to set up a provisional government in December that would
then organize national elections.
   -Trims aid to the mujaheddin, the rebels fighting the
Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan, from Bush's request for
$300 million to $250 million. That compares with $280 million last
year.
   The aid also will be split into two six-month increments. This
will give an opportunity for the United States to end the
assistance at mid-year if talks between Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze result in
agreement on a mutual aid suspension.
   The intelligence bill also includes provisions intended to head
off a recurrence of a scandal like the Iran-Contra affair, which
came to public attention in 1986.
   The section includes a new definition of covert action: an
operation undertaken by the United States in another country ``to
influence political, economic or military conditions abroad'' in a
way that the U.S. role is not acknowledged publicly.
   Under the new provisions, any covert action must be approved by
the president in advance, in writing, in a document known as a
``finding.'' The finding must state that the action is necessary to
support U.S. foreign policy objectives, and must be reported to
congressional overseers ``in a timely fashion.''
   The finding also must spell out which U.S. agencies will be
involved and whether any outside party will be enlisted in the
operation. The covert action may not be used to influence domestic
political processes or public opinion, and may not violate the
Constitution.
   In the Iran-Contra affair, congressional investigators found
that ``a cabal of zealots'' inside the executive branch had
commandeered policymaking, set up operations outside normal
government controls and failed to notify Congress of efforts to
trade arms for U.S. hostages in Iran and generate money to supply
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said the provisions in the new bill ``really put that
chapter behind us ... I'm really pleased that we now have some
positive, tangible results from those long investigations that were
undertaken. It is perhaps the most significant part of the bill.''

<HEAD>Senate Incumbents Have Huge Fund-Raising Edges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen Senate incumbents who face the voters
in two weeks enjoy better than 9-to-1 fund-raising edges over
opponents, according to a survey that indicates spending in a
handful of Senate races has or likely will pass $10 million.
   In addition to the 12 senators with the whopping fund-raising
advantages, another nine incumbents up for re-election had raised
at least double the amounts of their challengers, Common Cause said
in one of its periodic analyses of campaign finances.
   ``When it comes to our political system, rich incumbents are
getting richer, and poor challengers are getting poorer,'' Common
Cause President Fred Wertheimer said Wednesday in a statement
released with the survey.
   In the 27 Senate races in which incumbents faced opposition, the
incumbents enjoyed edges in all major fund-raising areas, Common
Cause said. That includes a 4-to-1 edge in political action
committee contributions. Incumbents on average were outspending
challengers by more than 3-to-1, the group said.
   The only incumbent trailing a challenger in fund-raising was
Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, a Democrat who was appointed to the
seat in May. Akaka is facing his former House colleague, Republican
Rep. Pat Saiki. As of Sept. 30, she had raised $883,00 to Akaka's
$821,000.
   Common Cause, which compiled the information from the latest
campaign reports to the Federal Election Commission, said four
Senate incumbents with no major party opposition this fall had at
least $850,000 in their campaign coffers as of Sept. 30.
   Common Cause is one of the major lobbying forces behind
legislation designed to restrict or eliminate political action
committee contributions and take other steps to cut the
fund-raising advantages of incumbency. But the legislation appears
dead for the year as Congress rushes to adjourn before the Nov. 6
elections.
   In its latest study, the organization said combined spending in
several Senate races had or was heading past the $10 million mark.
   The costliest race so far has been the North Carolina contest
between Republican Sen. Jesse Helms and Democrat Harvey Gantt. As
of Sept 30, the cutoff date for the latest reports to the Federal
Election Commission, Gantt and Helms had spent a combined $16.9
million.
   In Texas, the matchup of Democrat Hugh Parmer and heavily
favored Republican Sen. Phil Gramm had cost a combined $10.9
million. Spending in the Illinois contest pitting Democratic Sen.
Paul Simon against Republican Rep. Lynn Martin totaled nearly $10.7
million.
   The New Jersey race pitting Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley against
longshot Republican Christine Todd Whitman had combined spending of
$9.1 million as of Sept. 30 and spending in the Massachusetts race
pitting Democratic Sen. John Kerry against GOP nominee Jim
Rappaport was nearing $8 million at the filing cutoff.
   The dozen incumbents enjoying at least a 9-to-1 fund-raising
edge heading into the final five weeks of the election cycle were:
Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware, Bradley, David Boren of
Oklahoma, Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Jay Rockefeller of West
Virginia. Also: Republican Sens. Ted Stevens of Alaska, Nancy
Kassebaum of Kansas, Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Gramm and Alan
Simpson of Wyoming.
   The nine incumbents who had at least doubled the fund-raising of
their challengers but not reached a 9-to-1 edge are Democrats
Howard Heflin of Alabama, Simon, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana,
Kerry, Carl Levin of Michigan and Max Baucus of Montana and
Republicans Dan Coats of Indiana, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and
Helms. Johnston already has won his race through Louisiana's unique
open primary system.
   Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Pryor of Arkansas and
Republicans Thad Cochran of Mississippi and John Warner of Virginia
face no major opposition in their re-election bids.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
needs a break from economic headaches at home, he's likely to find
it in the warmth of adoring Spaniards during a three-day visit that
begins Friday.
   He also comes in search of real economic help - reciprocal
agreements are ready for signing, and Madrid is offering
state-guaranteed credits of up to $1 billion for the purchase of
Spanish consumer and industrial goods.
   The first Spanish visit by a Soviet head of state aims to put
relations between the two countrieson an equal footing with
Moscow's ties to other major Western nations, Foreign Minister
Francisco Fernandez said.
   ``The Gorbachev visit is very important because it comes at a
time of great changes in the world, especially in Europe,'' said
Juan Antonio Yanez, adviser to Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
   ``And it's a time when the Soviet Union finds itself at a
crucial moment in its economic and political development,'' he
said.
   Gorbachev is to be accompanied by his wife, Raisa, Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevarnadze and a number of top economic, political
and cultural advisers.
   Soviet historian Svetlana Podzarskaya, who is accompanying
Gorbachev, told Spanish reporters in Moscow that both sides feel an
urgency to deepen relations.
   ``Spain and the Soviet Union remained outside the European
process of economic and political development for many years for
political reasons,'' Podzarskaya said.
   ``Now, we both have entered. Spain did it earlier and with more
success,'' she said, referring to Madrid's 1986 entry into the
European Economic Community. ``We're just starting along the
path.''
   The Soviet leader's popularity is running particularly high in
Spain in the wake of his recent Nobel Peace Prize, and opposition
politicans from conservatives to traditional Communists are
jockeying for photo opportunities with Gorbachev.
   Officials at two Madrid universities awarding him honorary
degrees are battling for the right to host the joint awards
ceremony. The Soviets suggested a neutral site.
   Gorbachev is to sign a key joint political statement
underscoring the two countries' commitment to broad European unity
and cooperation and strengthening of world security.
   ``We go to Spain in acknowledgement of Spain's creative and
growing role in the development of European and non-European
policy,'' Gorbachev told reporters in Moscow on Monday.
   ``There is a deep reserve of good feeling among Spaniards toward
the Soviet Union,'' Madrid University International Relations Prof.
Roberto Mesas said.
   ``Spaniards, particularly on the left, remember the Soviets'
political and military support for the democratic 1931-39 Second
Republic during the 1936-39 Civil War.''
   The war was sparked by a military rebellion led by Gen.
Francisco Franco and resulted in nearly 40 years of right-wing
dictatorship under Franco that ended only with his death in 1975.
Political parties were banned, and Communists in particular
suffered from the repression.
   A year after Franco's death, the Communist Party was legalized.
In 1977 Spain held its first democratic elections since 1936 and
restored the diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union cut for
four decades.
   ``People recall warmly the Soviet military support for the
elected government during the Civil War at a time when the French
and British appeared to take a non-interventionist stance that
condemned Spain to dictatorship,'' Mesas said.
   Key accords to be signed during Gorbachev's visit include one on
reciprocal investment guarantees and another on joint development
of tourism, a key Spanish industry and the nation's chief foreign
currency earner.
   Other accords will set up regular meetings between government
ministers and officials, top military brass and cultural officials
as well as the establishment of culture centers.
   Gorbachev is to meet with King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, who
made a state visit to Moscow in 1984. The Soviet leader will also
meet with Gonzalez and speak before a group of parliamentarians.
   He also isto visit Barcelona to promote investment and view the
site of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games.

   Already strained U.S.-Israeli relations are
under new pressures, following the Bush administration's second
vote against Israel in the United Nations despite a plea for
understanding from Jerusalem.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III - and others in the
administration who would like to see Israel negotiate with
Palestinians Arabs - will try to repair the damage before it
destroys any chance for getting those talks started.
   But Israel, which has depended on U.S. support in a world
organization largely hostile to the Jewish state, is bound to feel
even more anxious about risking negotiations with only the Bush
administration for protection.
   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to rebuke
Israel for rejecting a U.N. mission to investigate the killings of
19 Palestinian Arabs in Jerusalem. The vote followed Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rejection of an appeal from President
Bush to allow the investigation.
   It was the second time the United States turned against its old
friend over the Oct. 8 incident on the Temple Mount.
   The administration sponsored the initial Security Council
resolution, adopted unanimously Oct. 12, which condemned Israel and
directed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to send
investigators to Jerusalem.
   Bush, in his letter to Shamir, urged the Israeli leader to
reverse the Israeli Cabinet's decision not to cooperate in the
inquiry.
   But Shamir and Israeli diplomats in Jerusalem and in Washington
informed the administration the decision was based on two
principles that could not be reversed, U.S. officials and other
sources told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   One was that the Security Council had already condemned Israel
so the inquiry could hardly be an open-minded one. The other was
that admitting the U.N. investigators could challenge the
sovereignty Israel claims over all of Jerusalem as its capital.
   This plea for understanding was conveyed to U.S. officials in
Jerusalem and in Washington.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said Bush's
letter expressed condolences about the violence between Israelis
and Palestinians and told Shamir it was ``important to all of us to
have the focus back on Iraq.''
   The 19 Palestinians were slain after police used tear gas and
rubber bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the stoning of
Jews praying at the Western Wall. The attack on the Jews was not
condemned in the resolution.
   Israel felt it was being singled out unfairly. Its Cabinet felt
that not only was the resolution one-sided, but riots at holy
places in other countries with a much higher death toll are
routinely ignored by the United Nations.
   The administration, urging Israel to cooperate with the inquiry,
said it was the only way for the facts to be sorted out. The
Israeli government has ordered its own investigation.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said if Shamir refused
to cooperate ``the mood of the council will be less solicitous than
if they did.'' However, he said no resolutions apart from the
renewed request had been prepared for council action.
   While Israelis of various political persuasions may differ on
most issues, there is general unanimity that Jerusalem must remain
Israel's capital.
   The predominantly Arab eastern sector was under Jordan's rule
for 19 years until Israeli forces captured it during the 1967
Mideast war.
   The Cabinet's decision, and Shamir's refusal to reverse it,
reflected concern that the United Nations was trying to get a
foothold in the city.
   The United States and nearly all other nations do not recognize
Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
   Bush has referred to it as occupied territory, and the assertion
contributed to the strains between the United States and Israel.
The settlement of some Soviet Jewish refugees in East Jerusalem,
the West Bank and Gaza is another sore point.
   The Bush administration considers settlements of Soviet refugees
or any other Jews in the territories an obstacle to peace since the
Arabs hope to recapture the lands they lost in the 1967 war.
   Like its predecessors, the administration also is committed to
urging Israel to give up most if not all of the territory in
exchange for Arab acceptance of the Jewish state.

   One disgruntled lawmaker says he's seen the
likes of the 101st Congress before.
   ``Think of what it would be like to watch every `Friday the
13th' movie back to back,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``Freddy
is hiding somewhere in the corridors.''
   Like a character in a bad horror film, this Congress won't die.
   October 5 was the original adjournment date. Then, Oct. 12. Then
the 18th. Next, well, maybe before Halloween. Congress has never
pushed its session so close to an election.
   Credibility is nil. When word of an impending budget deal
filtered through the Capitol on Wednesday, the news was greeted
with a mix of skepticism and pseudo-enthusiasm.
   ``It's like the boy who cried wolf,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., chairman of the House Rules Committee.
   ``The joy will come when the speaker hits the gavel and says the
final two words: sine die,'' the final adjournment, said Rep. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., was optimistic for a weekend
departure and said members were talking of little else. ``That's
the number one topic - to get out of here,'' he said.
   Was he now overcome with enthusiasm?
   ``Euphoria,'' he deadpanned.
   ``Exhilaration. Ecstasy. Passion,'' added Rep. Charles Wilson,
D-Texas.
   Despite frustration, lawmakers said there still was no sentiment
for adjourning now and trying again to finish the year's business
after the election.
   ``If there's a lame duck we're all dead ducks,'' said Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., adding that he was fortunate to be running for
re-election unopposed this year.
   Not everyone was finding humor in Congress' predicament.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., complained that lawmakers'
self-flagellation wasn't helping matters. ``He that maketh himself
an ass must not take it ill if men ride him,'' he reminded the
Senate.
   And tempers were running short. When Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
was blocked early today from offering an amendment to a bill
providing money to run Congress, he confronted Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla.
   ``This is dirty pool,'' Glenn fumed, poking his finger hard into
Nickles' chest. ``You told me not to filibuster, now you
filibuster.'' Glenn then stalked off the floor.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, was a pessimist.
   Sitting outside the House chamber, he observed how lawmakers had
nobody to blame but themselves. Less than two weeks before the
election and with the public clamoring for budget action, the House
had spent most of the afternoon in a turf fight between two
committees on a seafood inspection bill.
   ``People are not just tired, they're exhausted,'' he said. ``And
we spend the whole afternoon talking about fish.''

<HEAD>Iraq Seeks Split In Western Alliance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is offering to swap Canadian and German
hostages for diplomatic visits from those countries in an effort to
drive a wedge in the western alliance against Baghdad, say
congressional sources.
   The offers were made in recent days and represent cynical
attempts to use hostages as bargaining chips, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told lawmakers
Wednesday in a closed-door briefing, the sources said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invited the foreign ministers of
those two countries to visit his country, holding out the prospect
that some of their nationals could be released if they did so,
House members were told.
   The two Cabinet members said the overtures have failed but are
signs that Saddam would like to weaken Western resolve by
manipulating the hostages he holds, said sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But the administration also described Saddam's military forces
as deeply dug in along the border with Saudi Arabia, and the
defensive posture belies any shift toward a genuine openness to
diplomatic solutions to the standoff, said the sources.
   ``My view is that from time to time (Saddam) makes efforts
designed purely to drive wedges between members of the coalition,''
Cheney told reporters after the briefing. ``But if you look at his
deplyments, there is no indication he is preparing to withdraw.''
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said the reported entreaties to U.S.
allies ``are viewed by our guys as cynical, exploitative of the
hostages, and I think Congress agrees with that assessment.''
   He said Baker described the situation as like that in a
political cartoon showing Saddam with bound hostages behind a sign
that reads, ``The Bazaar is Open.''
   The pessimism about any change in Iraq's stance was underscored
by Sen. Richard Lugar, a senior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, who flatly predicted: ``The fact is that we're
headed toward conflict.''
   ``We're headed toward conflict because Saddam (Hussein) is
reinforcing, as far as we can see, his forces in Kuwait, shows no
sign whatsoever of giving up anything, and the United Nations is on
a collision course to make sure he does give it up,'' said Lugar,
R-Ind.
   ``I think the possibility of armed conflict depends entirely
upon our ability and willingness to bring it about,'' he said.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., also
said Cheney told lawmakers there is no clear evidence that the
Iraqis have learned how to operate the HAWK anti-aircraft missiles
they captured in Kuwait.
   Aspin said Baker and Cheney had declined to discuss how they
might consult with Congress, which is about to adjourn for the
year, if U.S. military action is called for in the Middle East.
   ``If a decision is made to use military force in response to a
provocation, my guess is they will do that and consult
afterwards,'' Aspin told reporters.
   But if the international embargo does not succeed in driving
Saddam from Kuwait in a reasonable time and Bush decides to issue
an ultimatum to Iraq, the procedure for consulting with Congress
has been left unclear, he said.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said they would reserve the right to call
Congress back into session for such consultations, and announced
creation of a bipartisan 18-member consultative group that would be
available to consult with the president during the adjournment
period.

<HEAD>Martinez Aims at Chiles' Relationship With Ousted CenTrust
Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez asked his Democratic
opponent, former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles, to explain his
relationship with ousted CenTrust chairman David Paul.
   Martinez's written request followed a report Tuesday in USA
Today that showed Chiles on Paul's personal calendar during visits
to Washington in 1987 and 1988.
   The Miami-based savings and loan, once the state's largest, was
taken over by federal regulators in February at a loss of $1.8
billion.
   ``It's ridiculous innuendo in this letter,'' said Julie
Fletcher, campaign spokeswoman for Chiles.
   ``He (Chiles) met with him once, an introductory, routine
courtesy meeting,'' said Fletcher. ``They talked about CenTrust
activities. A very short meeting.''
   Fletcher said Chiles' records showed the 15-minute meeting
sought by Paul took place Nov. 19, 1987, and was so inconsequential
that Chiles initially didn't recall it.

   Republican Assembly candidate Kevin
Hermening said he asked a conservative political action committee
to pull about $25,000 in television commercials designed to help
his campaign.
   But a spokeswoman for GOPAC, a political action committee for
conservative U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, said the ads would
continue, likely right up to the Nov. 6 election.
   ``I've seen these ads, and they are sending the wrong message,''
said Hermening. ``I believe candidates should be able to control
their own campaign messages. They should be able to do that without
outside influence.''
   Two Wausau television stations, WAOW and WSAW, said GOPAC
purchased about $25,000 worth of advertising time for commercials
for Hermening. The commercials are ``pseudo-biography spots,''
portraying Hermening's experience as a former Iranian hostage,
campaign officials said.
   Hermening was the youngest of 52 hostages taken at the embassy
in Iran in 1979 and held for 444 days.
   Hermening ran for Congress in 1986 and 1988 and is challenging
Democratic
   Rep. Brad Zweck.

   Mitchell's biggest donor is himself. A contribution list
provided by the campaign shows he has given himself $24,520.
   Besides his own donations, Mitchell's biggest entry is from the
state Democratic Party, which gave $5,000. Mitchell said that money
actually came from U.S. Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and was

   Democrat Ben Nelson's withdrawal of broadcast
advertising that mentions Gov. Kay Orr's name is hypocritical, a
spokesman for Mrs. Orr's campaign said Wednesday.
   Nelson said he is canceling all television and radio ads that
mention Mrs. Orr's name or make negative references to her. Nelson
asked Mrs. Orr to do the same by noon Thursday, in keeping with an
agreement the candidates for governor reached during their Tuesday
debate in Lincoln.
   ``This is the most hypocritical thing we've seen by Ben Nelson
and his media thugs,'' Mrs. Orr's campaign manager, Scott Matter,
said from Lincoln.
   ``Nelson's been swinging a heavy ax for several months. Now he's
saying, `Forget all that and have a positive campaign,''' Matter

<TEXT>
   A neighborhood bully was convicted of attempted
murder for tying up a 12-year-old boy and setting him on fire
during a robbery that left his victim scarred for life.
   The defendant, a 14-year-old who appears much older, was also
found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping, robbery and other offenses in
the March 7 attack on David Opont.
   ``There could be no other conclusion than he secreted (David),
tied him hand and foot and he set him on fire,'' ruled Family Court
Judge Joseph A. Esquirol Jr., who presided over the non-jury trial.
   The older boy ``intended to and did in fact severely and
permanently disfigure David,'' the judge said.
   Authorities said the teen-ager, whose name was withheld because
of his age, was known in his Brooklyn neighborhood as a bully who
taunted and stole from smaller children.
   Under juvenile law, he can be confined to a detention center for
three years, but the sentence can be extended each year afterward
until he is 21.
   Esquirol also ordered the boy to undergo psychological tests.
   The attack shocked the city and evoked an outpouring of sympathy
and get-well messages from across the nation. While in the
hospital, David was visited by former President Reagan, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and several entertainment and sports figures.
   In September, David, frail but recovering from his attack, stood
and pointed out his attacker in the courtroom. He said the boy
stopped him and a companion as they walked to school and searched
their pockets for money.
   The bully then took him into an abandoned building, bound him
and set him on fire after he refused to smoke something offered
him, David said.
   David and his parents were not in the courtroom when the verdict
was returned Wednesday, but he issued a statement later saying, ``I
am looking forward to my life and all the challenge it brings.''
   David, who moved with his family from Haiti two years ago,
suffered severe burns over much of his body and was initially given
less than a 50 percent chance of survival.
   After several skin grafts, he was released from the hospital in
August but is still undergoing extensive rehabilitation.

   Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh
claims the CIA and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh abused secrecy
procedures to frustrate the prosecution of a former CIA agent.
   ``The attorney general and the CIA not only frustrated the
public development'' of evidence against former CIA agent Joseph
Fernandez, ``but did so in a manner that exasperated the district
court and dragged out the resolution of this issue in unproductive
litigation,'' Walsh charged Wednesday in a report on the case.
   Walsh issued his report nearly two weeks after Thornburgh
effectively ended the prosecution by reaffirming his determination
to block the release of secrets that the judge had already said
Fernandez was entitled to use in his defense.
   The documents at issue showed the location of CIA facilities in
Central America and detailing agency operations in Costa Rica. The
Justice Department quoted an administration official as saying
release of such information would strike a ``devastating'' blow to
national security.
   Thornburgh's action marked the first time that an attorney
general's use of a provision of the Classified Information
Procedures Act had blocked a prosecution.

<HEAD>Gore Seeks Curbs On Genetic Screening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should safeguard workers' rights
before employers begin widespread screening for genetic diseases,
says Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.
   Gore released a report Wednesday by the Office of Technology
Assessment which showed that few U.S. companies now require genetic
testing of their employees and applicants. But he said Congress
should move now, before the practice becomes more widespread, to
head off discrimination against workers on the basis of genetic
characteristics.
   ``To a large extent there are few clear guidelines on how these
tests can be used or how workers can be protected from having their
rights violated,'' said Gore, who requested the report.
   Genetic screening can help save lives by alerting an employer to
a worker's susceptibility to a particular occupational exposure,
the report noted.
   But it expressed concern that employers might deny jobs to
anyone whose tests show they are at risk of genetic disease and
could prove a burden to a company's health insurance program.
   Genetic tests are available to detect sickle cell anemia, cystic
fibrosis, Huntington's disease, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy and other diseases. Future tests could screen for such
things as hypertension, dyslexia, Alzheimer's disease and cancer,
the report said.

   The Air Force general named to replace the
chief of staff ousted for public comments about U.S. contingency
plans against Iraq says his predecessor made an ``honest mistake.''
   Gen. Merrill A. McPeak told the Senate Armed Services Committee
his colleague erred in discussing issues within the president's
bailiwick and speaking on the record with news reporters for 15
consecutive hours.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney fired Gen. Michael Dugan on Sept.
17, one day after Dugan's statements about contingency plans to
unleash massive air raids on Iraq and target Saddam Hussein
personally appeared in newspapers.
   Cheney said Dugan had violated Pentagon rules by publicly
discussing likely military targets inside Iraq and disclosing
classified information about the size of U.S. forces in the gulf
area.
   ``It was an honest mistake on his part, nevertheless a mistake.
I'll certainly seek to avoid making the same mistake,'' McPeak told
the panel at his confirmation hearing.
   Lawmakers indicated no opposition to the nominee, a 54-year-old
nativeof Santa Rosa, Calif., who is commander-in-chief of forces
in the Pacific region.
   While serving as a fighter pilot in 1961, McPeak said he struck
up a friendship with Dugan, a fellow lieutenant. ``Mike Dugan is
probably my closest friend in the U.S. Air Force,'' McPeak said.
   Dugan remains at the Pentagon as a special assistant to Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice. He is currently overseeing studies on
the future needs for pilots and navigators as well as the officer
evaluation system.

   The sixth game of the world chess championship
between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov was adjourned until
tonight with experts split on whether it would end in a draw or a

   Kasparov, the defending champion, leads 3 points to 2 in the
24-game series. The first player to reach 12{ points wins the
championship.
   Wednesday's game was called for the night after Kasparov wrote
down and sealed his 42nd move. The envelope was to be reopened with
the resumption of play.
   During the recess, each player may consult his assistants on how
to proceed.
   National master Shelby Lyman said Kasparov had ``virtually no
chance'' of losing based on the board positions at adjournment.
   Grandmaster Roman Dzindzichashvili agreed: ``I think it's
totally lost for Karpov.''
   But grandmaster Leonid Shamkovich said he thought the game would
end in a draw because Kasparov does not have enough pieces to
checkmate.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the rest
will be played in Lyon, France. A win is worth a point, a draw a
half-point.
   The winner will get $1.7 million and the loser $1.3 million.

<HEAD>Officials: City's New Brand of Condom is Too Tight, Splits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health activists say the city's newer,
cheaper giveaway condoms are too tight and so flimsy they split
apart with the insertion of a couple of fingers.
   ``If they break on your finger, there's a real risk they could
break elsewhere on your body,'' said David Fair, former director of
the city AIDS Activities Coordinating Office.
   Fair and others expressed concern that poor people, drug users
and others who use the city's free condoms are getting inadequate
protection from AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
   Fair said Wednesday that apparently the new brand, Crown, was
substituted when the price of the old brand, Prime, went up from 5
to 5{ cents apiece.
   Gary Henderson, an assistant commissioner at the city
Procurement Department, would not say why the switch was made or
whether the specifications were changed.
   The Health Department referred questions to James Hymes, current
director of the AIDS Activities Coordinating Office. Hymes said he
got no complaints after checking with 10 AIDS counselors who
routinely demonstrate the toughness of condoms by putting their
fist into them.
   He said he was checking whether the Crown condoms met
specifications issued by the office. Until he hears conclusively,
he recommended they not be used.
   The condoms are made by Okamoto Industries Inc. of Tokyo.
Hisayuki Naito, vice president for marketing of its American
subsidiary, Okamoto U.S.A., in Stratford, Conn., said he had
received no complaints.
   He said the Crown condom is roughly 1 millimeter smaller in
diameter than the average brand and ``a little bit thin, but the
same strength'' as thicker brands. He said a Stanford University
study rated the condoms as good.
   As for the fit, he said, ``If you ask 100 people, you can get
100 different opinions.''
   ``The only people who would like these condoms are people who
like pain,'' Fair said.
   Fran Stoffa, director of the AIDS Task Force, said his private
agency stopped distributing them. ``There's a visible difference in
the quality,'' Stoffa said. ``They're real thin. It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to see that.''
   To demonstrate, he inserted his hand into the Crown condom,
which split readily. ``It should be able to withstand me putting a
fist into them,'' Stoffa said.
   However, Stoffa, whose office has been distributing the Crown
condoms for about six weeks, said, ``Not a whole lot of people
complain about it. It's not the kind of thing where you demand your
money back.''
   This year's city budget, prepared by Fair, called for the
purchase of 1 million condoms, with money set aside for agencies to
buy another million. The city controller's office said the city
recently bought 625,000 condoms at 5.1 cents apiece.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Goldsmith, an AP foreign correspondent for
45 years who reported on wars and rebellions in Africa, Asia and
the Middle East, has died at a hospital in southern France. He was
68.
   Goldsmith died Wednesday of a massive stomach hemorrhage, said
his doctor at the Grasse hospital. He suffered a stroke Oct. 1 and
was hospitalized again Sunday after a relapse.
   Goldsmith's most recent post was North Africa correspondent,
based in Paris but traveling frequently. Earlier, he served as a
news staffer and bureau chief in Geneva.
   He reported on numerous conflicts in Africa, Southeast Asia and
the Middle East, and covered Olympic Games in Grenoble, France;
Montreal; Seoul; and Los Angeles, among others.
   ``Mike brought the enthusiam of the cub reporter and the honed
wisdom of an old foreign service hand to everything he did,''
President and General Manager Lou Boccardi said Wednesday.
   ``Wherever the big story was - within his territory or outside
it - when we sent Mike there, we knew that the story would nestle
safely in the hands of a pro. The temptation is to think of Mike as
among the last of a breed. Rather, I think of him as someone whose
example assures that within the AP the breed will go on,'' Boccardi
said.
   This year, Goldsmith spent five weeks in Liberia covering the
civil war in that West African nation. He was detained and briefly
beaten by government soldiers on Aug. 12.
   The soldiers threatened to shoot Goldsmith and two other Western
reporters as spies after they had crossed on foot through rebel
lines into government-controlled territory in the center of
Monrovia, the capital. But they eventually were released.
   Later in the summer Goldsmith attended the Venice film festival
for the premiere of a movie by German director Werner Herzog about
the deposed Central African Emperor Bokassa I. Goldsmith served as
an adviser on the film and interviewed some of Bokassa's relatives.
   Goldsmith was on assignment in Bangui covering Bokassa's
coronation in 1977 when authorities arrested him and accused him of
being a spy.
   He was beaten unconscious by Bokassa, two of his sons and a
group of aides.
   After being held a month in the infamous Naragba prison,
Goldsmith was summoned to Bokassa's palace, where Bokassa ranted at
him for hours before announcing he was releasing him for
``humanitarian reasons.''
   Despite this incident, Goldsmith keep in touch with the deposed
emperor while he lived in exile in France.
   The Associated Press Managing Editors and the Overseas Press
Club cited Goldsmith in connection with the Bokassa story.
   Goldsmith was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1921 to British
parents.
   He was educated at London University and served as an
intelligence officer in the British Army's Royal Ulster Rifles in
World War II.
   He joined AP in 1945 in London and was assigned to
British-occupied Germany.
   Following a roving assignment in Italy, he transferred to Geneva
in 1948 and remained there nearly two decades covering U.N.
European headquarters and assignments in Africa and the Middle
East.
   He reported on post-independence turmoil in the Congo, now
Zaire, Algeria and South Yemen, and the construction of the Berlin
Wall.
   Goldsmith also went to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia following the
1968 Tet offensive and then returned to cover the Paris peace
talks.
   He covered the 1973 Middle East war and continued reporting on
developments in Africa.
   In 1980, he went to Afghanistan to cover the aftermath of the
Soviet invasion, reporting on an anti-Soviet movement in Kabul that
virtually paralyzed the government.
   He is survived by his wife, Roxanne; their son, Andrew, 15; and
two sons and a daughter from previous marriages - Martin, Michael
and Mary.
   Roxanne is the daughter of the late Sam Houston Johnson, author
of ``My Brother Lyndon.''
   His wife said there will be no funeral and that a memorial
service will be held in Paris at a later, unspecified date.

   Five former Persian Gulf hostages came home
Wednesday night, with one praising his tough-talking president and
all worrying about the fate of captives they left behind Iraq and
Kuwait.
   They were among 14 Americans brought out of Baghdad through the
efforts of an American-Iraqi group. Nine of them arrived in London
on Wednesday and were to fly home Thursday. The five others flew to
New York after a stopover in Amsterdam.
   ``I'm very elated to be at home,'' said Lloyd Graham, one of
five American men who arrived at John F. Kennedy International
Airport aboard a Royal Jordanian flight at 8:10 p.m.
   ``The celebration won't start until all our friends and
colleagues can come home too,'' the 48-year-old Houston man told an
airport news conference.
   Graham, who suffers from arteriosclerosis and has undergone two
quadruple bypass surgeries, appeared in good health, as did the
others.
   ``I'm glad to be home. Morale is great,'' said a man who
wouldn't give his name. He was identified by others at the news
conference as Mark Ward of Middletown, N.J., a Marine sergeant
attached to the U.S. Embassy in Iraq.
   ``George, keep up the good work,'' he said, apparently having
heard of the president's statements about the crisis. ``It's great
to be back.''
   His family toasted his arrival with champagne in plastic cups.
   Also on the flight was Jack Frazier, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif.,
who said he had been in Iraq doing construction work when the
country invaded the neighboring Kuwait.
   Frazier told reporters that leaving the other hostages behind
``was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.''
   After the invasion, the men stayed in private homes in the
Baghdad area through U.S. Embassy arrangements. They said the
Iraqis knew where they were.
   Frazier, Graham, Ward, Larry Murray and John Thompson were
allowed to leave either because they or their relatives have
medical problems, they said. None would specify why they had been
released.
   Murray's wife, Sandy, who lives in the Houston suburb of
Kingwood, said she ``talked to him briefly and he seems to be doing
very well. He's ready to come home.''
   She said in telephone conversations with her husband, ``he would
state that he never felt free to talk.''
   Mrs. Murray said her husband is ``in chronic pain.'' She didn't
know his current medical condition, but ``as far as I know, it's
stable.''
   Cheryl Graham flew from Texas to New York Wednesday to meet her
husband.
   ``He told me not to spend any money, but money's not important
at a time like this,'' Mrs. Graham said.
   The trip was engineered by seven members of the American-Iraqi
Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based group of U.S. citizens of
Iraqi descent.
   Dr. Ali Hossaini of Richmond, Va., said the hostages were
released after the foundation members met with Saddam Hussein for
2{ hours Sunday.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill Requiring Colleges to Report Crimes, Graduation
Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill awaiting the president's signature will
compel colleges and universities to tell students how many major
crimes are committed on campus.
   ``It is time to take the mask off the idea that a college campus
is a completely serene and protected environment,'' said Rep.
William Goodling, R-Pa., a former teacher and principal who was the
measure's House sponsor.
   The Senate approved the measure by a voice vote Wednesday,
sending it to President Bush for his signature. The bill passed the
House Monday night.
   House and Senate sponsors of the bill say they believe the
president will sign it.
   The``Student Right-To-Know and Campus Security Act'' would
require federally-aided colleges and universities to report campus
crime statistics each year to students and employees. Covered
crimes include murder, rape, robbery and auto theft.
   Information on violent crimes would have to be provided
immediately, and all crime data would be available to prospective
students on request.
   The measure was merged with another bill requiring institutions
to release graduation rates of all students and students on sports
scholarships. Schools would also have to make data available on
athletic department revenues and expenditures, and on racial
composition of scholarship athletes.
   Sponsors included Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., the former
Princeton University and New York Knicks basketball star; Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass; and Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   There is no comprehensive data on campus crime. Out of 3,000
colleges and universities and 5,000 other federally-aided,
post-secondary schools, only 352 provide crime statistics to the
FBI.
   Surveys show that 80 percent of campus crimes are committed by
one student upon another and that most of the violent crimes are
alcohol- or drug-related, according to Congress.
   Goodling introduced the bill in September 1989 after being
contacted by the parents of a 19-year-old Lehigh University student
who was raped and murdered in her dormitory room in 1986. The
assailant, also a Lehigh student, had entered the dormitory through
an emergency exit propped open by students visiting from another
dorm.
   Howard and Connie Clery of Bryn Mawr persuaded Pennsylvania and
nearly a dozen other state legislatures to require colleges and
universities to release statistics on crimes committed against
students. They began pushing for federal legislation last year.

   Congressional negotiators face several key tax
issues as they work on a compromise deficit-reduction bill.
   Here are some of them, according to a proposed compromise
incorporating elements from both parties. Exact figures could
change in the final agreement.
   RATES: The 28 percent top income tax rate on the wealthiest
600,000 Americans likely would be raised to 31 percent; they would
get a tax increase. Effective rates could even be higher, depending
on exemptions and deductions. About 4 million couples and
individuals who now pay a top rate of 33 percent would pay a
maximum 31 percent and get a tax cut.
   DEDUCTIONS: A couple or individual could write off only 97
percent of otherwise allowable itemized deductions on any portion
of adjusted gross income exceeding $100,000. Thus, a high-income
taxpayer would lose $300 in deductions for each $10,000 of income
above $100,000. This has the effect of raising the top marginal tax
rate on those people to 32 percent.
   EXEMPTIONS: Benefits from the $2,050 personal exemption allowed
each taxpayer and dependent would be reduced as taxable income
exceeds $100,000 for single people and $150,000 for childless
couples filing a joint return. The exemption would be fully lost
once income tops $225,000 for single individuals or $275,000 for a
couple filing jointly.
   Each exemption lost would raise the effective marginal tax rate
by one-half percentage point; the bigger the family, the higher
their marginal rate. Thus, a couple with two children would pay a
top rate of 34 percent on part of their income: the regular 31
percent rate plus 1 percentage point because of the limit on
deductions and 2 points by losing their exemptions.
   CAPITAL GAINS: The maximum tax rate on capital gains, which are
profits from the sale of assets such as investments, would be 28
percent, even though wages and other income would be taxed as high
as 31 percent. This would benefit those who pay a top 33 percent
rate on income, including capital gains, under present law.
   GASOLINE: The 9-cent-a-gallon tax would be increased by 5 or 6
cents.
   ALCOHOL: Negotiators already have settled on higher taxes on
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, airplane tickets, furs and jewelry
and expensive cars.

<HEAD>Science Writer Says He Lost Job Over Creationism Beliefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely published writer on scientific topics
says Scientific American magazine wooed him, then left him at the
altar because he believes in the Biblical account of creation.
   Forrest M. Mims III alleged Wednesday that an editor at the
respected publication asked if he'd like to take over its column
about amateur experiments and rejected him after learning of his
beliefs.
   Mims, 46, of Seguin, Tex., insisted his own writing is unbiased
and said he has never written about creationism.
   ``I've wanted this opportunity for 20 years,'' he said. ``To
have the opportunity and then lose it because of what I do on
Sunday is absolutely incredible.''
   Scientific American publisher John Moehling refused to address
Mims' allegations in detail but said, ``We don't discriminate in
our pages among the people who work here or write for us. The
people who read us deserve to know that.''
   Mims said that he has complained to two professional societies,
which ``said if I identified them they would drop the complaints.''
   Mims has written in more than 60 publications, including Science
Digest, The American Journal of Physics and National Geographic
World, a sister publication of National Geographic.
   He said that in 1989 a Scientific American editor expressed
enthusiasm for his work and asked if he'd like to become the
magazine's ``Amateur Scientist'' columnist.
   He said he canceled practically all his writing assignments and
was flown to New York, where Scientific American staffers
congratulated him for getting the job.
   But the editor who invited him there suddenly grew cold when
Mims mentioned he'd written for Christian magazines on such topics
as ``how to organize bicycle trips for church kids,'' the writer
said.
   The editor asked if Mims accepted Darwin's theory of evolution,
Mims said. ``I replied that I did not.''
   Later, he said, the editor warned him he would be fired or
docked in pay if he ``ever wrote anything about creationism for any
magazine.'' The editor ended the meeting by telling Mims he had not
made up his mind whom to hire, Mims said.
   The magazine ended up publishing three of his columns this year:
about safely observing sunspots; about monitoring ultraviolet
radiation, and about taking aerial photographs from helium-filled
trash bags.
   Mims now edits a new amateur science magazine, Science Probe!

   Five American men freed by Iraq for medical
reasons are back in the United States, where one of them, a Marine,
raised a toast to President Bush to ``keep up the good work.''
   Another hostage was welcomed by his wife, who flew in from Texas
despite his urgings to save the air fare. ``He told me not to spend
any money, but money's not important at a time like this,'' Cheryl
Graham said.
   Her husband, Lloyd Graham, was among 14 U.S. hostages and 32
British captives freed by Iraq.
   Five of the Americans arrived at Kennedy Airport aboard a Royal
Jordanian Airlines flight Wednesday night. The nine other Americans
stayed in London overnight and were expected to fly to the United
States today.
   ``I'm very elated to be at home,'' Graham said. ``The
celebration won't start until all our friends and colleagues can
come home, too.''
   Those released were freed because either they or family members
have serious medical conditions.
   Graham, 48, of Houston, suffers from arteriosclerosis and has
undergone two quadruple bypass surgeries.
   Another freed hostage, Jack Frazier, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif.,
said he was doing construction work in Iraq when Saddam Hussein's
forces invaded Kuwait in August.
   He said Americans being held in Baghdad could move around ``very
discreetly'' and were allowed to go out daily to buy food. The men
had been staying in diplomatic ``safe houses'' in Iraq arranged by
the U.S. Embassy.
   Leaving his fellow hostages behind ``was the hardest thing I've
ever done in my life,'' Frazier said.
   The family of one man who wouldn't give his name toasted his
safe arrival with champagne in plastic cups.
   The man, identified by others as Marine Sgt. Mark Ward of
Middletown, N.J., a soldier attached to the U.S. Embassy in Iraq,
praised the president for his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.
``George, keep up the good work,'' he said.
   The hostages' release came after a meeting Sunday between Saddam
and members of the Washington-based American-Iraqi Foundation.

<HEAD>Cuba Deports Mexican TV Crew Over Soviet Report</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba has expelled a Mexican television crew
in anger over a report by the network on a leading Soviet
newspaper's criticism of Cuban President Fidel Castro, the
television reported.
   The action Wednesday against reporters from a country with
important links to Cuba appeared to underscore Cuban frustration at
worsening ties with Moscow, which has cut aid to Havana and is
trying to force Castro to embrace reforms.
   ``They told us we were expelled from Cuba and we had to leave
today,'' said Televisa reporter Jose Eduardo Campos during a live
interview on a late-night edition of the private network's Eco news
progam.
   Campos said Cuban officials expressed anger over an Eco report
from Moscow quoting a critical report about Castro and his brother
in the Soviet daily Pravda. He did not give a date or other details
of the Pravda article.
   ``They explained to us that the work we had done in Havana had
been to their liking.'' Campos said. But because of the Moscow
report, ``the television Eco was lying ... and that Eco was not
going to be received in Havana.''
   Anchorman Jacobo Zabludovsky said the report from Moscow
``simply was limited to a textual translation of what was
published'' in Pravda, the official Soviet Communist Party
newspaper.
   Castro, a hard-line communist, has criticized Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's endorsemehnt of market-oriented reform.
Massive Soviet aid to Cuba has been scaled back.
   Campos said he and camera crew members Roberto Ruvalcabo and
Guillermo Gomez had arrived in Havana on Saturday and worked
``without any problem'' until they were summoned to the Foreign
Ministry at midday Wednesday.
   Ruvalcabo said officials told them ``that we were undesirable
persons'' and that they used the word ``deported'' when the crew
was loaded on a plane for Mexico.
   Televisa operates four broadcast channels in Mexico City alone,
with other channels elsewhere in Mexico. It also carries additional
programs over cable. Eco broadcasts on one channel or another 24
hours a day.
   Such action against a major pro-government Mexican news outlet
is surprising because Mexico is one of Cuba's most important
friends.
   Mexican officials for many years have resisted U.S. attempts to
isolate Cuba in pan-American organizations, and they have
maintained air and sea links with the island nation.

<TEXT>
   Governments in the Ivory Coast and
Gabon will be tested on Sunday in elections that reflect growing
demands for multiparty democracy in sub-Saharan Africa.
   The Ivory Coast's octagenarian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
faces an opponent for the first time since independence from France
in 1960.
   In Gabon, President Omar Bongo's Democratic Party - with 22
years of autocratic rule - is being challenged by several
opposition parties in the last round of voting for the national
assembly.
   The ruling parties are favored in both elections, but their
supporters concede that it no longer will be possible to shut
opposition parties out of the system.
   All but a handful of black Africa's nations were one-party
states at the beginning of the year. When Communist regimes started
to fall in East Europe, Gabon's state-controlled newspaper The
Union commented:
   ``The great winds carrying democracy ... that have triumphed in
the countries of Eastern Europe will not shake the coconut trees in
Africa.''
   Within weeks, one African country after another was hit by
demonstrations demanding change.
   As in Eastern Europe, the collapse of economies was a major
cause of Africans' dissatisfaction.
   By now, at least 13 governments have said they accept multiparty
democracy in principle: Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Congo,
Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mozambique, Sao Tome and
Principe, Somalia, Zaire and Zambia.
   Some governments, including Kenya, Sierra Leone and the Central
African Republic, have refused to concede any rights to opposition
groups, equating criticism with treason.
   Although Houphouet-Boigny gave in to demands to legalize
opposition parties following riots in February, his government has
used every device at its command to block them.
   Opposition meetings were often banned or constrained by broad
restrictions. Government-controlled television and radio rarely
mentioned the opposition, except to accuse it of responsibility for
damage caused during the riots.
   The media nightly broadcast lengthy reports on meetings of
people who supported the president.
   After several demonstrations at the national television station,
the opposition was granted 20 minutes nightly of air time, a
concession made only two weeks before the voting. One night, the
opposition broadcast was banned on grounds it contained lies.
   One government restriction may have backfired. Initially, it
sought to encourage as many opposition groups to form as possible,
diluting their strength. But only a week before the 10-day
presidential campaign was opened, candidates were required to post
the equivalent of an $80,000 bond.
   The bond would be forfeited if the candidate failed to gain at
least 15 percent of the vote. Only one of the newly formed parties,
the Ivorian Popular Front, was able to meet the demand.
   This reduced the election to a contest between Houphouet-Boigny
and front leader Laurent Gbagbo, a 46-year-old history professor
who had been jailed for two years for opposing the president.
   Although no opinion polls have been conducted, Gbagbo's party
acknowledged it was having difficult building from its base of
middle-class and educated Ivorians. It also lacked the staff of
Houphouet-Boigny's Ivorian Democratic Party, whose control of the
government for 30 years gives it broad leverage with the
population.
   The opposition's main campaign theme has been that
Houphouet-Boigny and his cronies have enriched themselves while the
country's once wealthy economy has been brought near collapse.
   Ivorian officials said first returns from voting will be
released Sunday night. Houphouet-Boigny, 85, Africa's
longest-serving president, received 100 percent of the vote in
1985, according to the government.
   The situation is more complicated in Gabon, also a former French
colony, where Bongo still has three years to serve as president.
   Even the legalization of opposition parties failed to stop
unrest this year, and France was briefly forced to send in troops
to evacuate Europeans from the oil center of Port Gentil.
   Bongo may have won some breathing space with the sharp increase
in oil prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The party of the
president, who claimed 98 percent of the vote in the last
presidential election, was winning 62 percent of the seats before
the final round of voting Sunday.

<HEAD>Panama Files $6.5 Billion Racketeering Suit Against Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega looted Panama's treasury, tortured
and killed opponents and ran drug and money-laundering rackets, his
country charges in a $6.5 billion lawsuit against the fallen
dictator.
   ``For 10 years, the thievery and thuggery that General Noriega
presided over damaged the people of Panama,'' said attorney Gregory
Craig, who filed the lawsuit in federal court Wednesday on Panama's
behalf.
   Noriega, who was driven from power by the U.S. invasion of
Panama in 1989, is in jail in Miami awaiting trial on charges of
taking $4.6 million in bribes to protect drug trafficking. He could
get up 145 years in prison if convicted.
   His lawyers accused Panama of filing the lawsuit in a conspiracy
with the United States to disrupt Noriega's efforts to defend
himself at the drug trial.
   ``They have a total disrespect for the Constitution of the
United States,'' defense attorney Frank Rubino said of Panama,
``and I believe they are doing this with the help of the United
States.''
   The United States holds $20 million of Noriega's money in frozen
international bank accounts, $6 million of which has been earmarked
for Noriega's defense attorneys. But Craig said Panama would seek
an injunction halting any release of the money.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said he did not believe the
lawsuit would interfere with Noriega's criminal trial, scheduled to
begin Jan. 28. But he acknowledged there could be a conflict
between Panama and Noriega's lawyers over who gets the money.
   ``As we have said in court ... several times, the United States
government is not the only government that has made claims on that
money,'' he said.
   Panama's lawsuit outlines Noriega's alleged participation in
assassination, torture, drug trafficking, money laundering,
embezzlement, detouring of funds, illegal sale of visas and
passports and abuse of authority.
   The lawsuit estimates actual damages at $500 million, which can
be tripled under racketeering law. An additional $5 billion is
sought in punitive damages.
   Another of Noriega's lawyers, Jon May, said he had not read the
entire lawsuit but that if it included allegations similar to the
government's criminal case, it is ``fiction.''
   Eduardo Vallarino, Panama's ambassador to the United States,
said his country is also preparing criminal charges against Noriega
but won't try to extradite him until after his U.S. trial.

   The two scientists who say they achieved
nuclear fusion at room temperature left others to defend their
claim today in a key review of their work and chances for renewed
funding.
   The whereabouts of B. Stanley Pns and Martin Fleischmann, who
work at the National Cold Fusion Institute at the University of
Utah, had been a mystery for days, during which the institute
couldn't reach them by either phone or fax machine.
   Late Wednesday, however, Pons requested a one-year sabbatical in
a fax transmission from his attorney, university President Chase
Peterson said. The attorney said Fleischmann was in England, but he
refused to disclose Pons' whereabouts.
   The state's nine-member Fusion Energy Advisory Council is
reviewing the scientists' disputed work and was scheduled to
discuss renewed funding at the meeting today. Pons, though not
Fleischmann, had been scheduled to address the panel.
   Randy Moon, the state's science adviser and a member of the
council, said the panel's decision would be affected by whether
Pons appeared.
   ``Stan owes it to a lot of people to be able to report on his
results,'' Moon said. ``A lot of people at the university have been
counting on Pons to show the research is viable.''
   Curtailing financing is a possibility, he said. The institute
was founded in part with a $5 million state grant.
   Pons and Fleischmann in March 1989 announced they had achieved a
nuclear fusion reaction in a jar at room temperature. Many
scientists have been unable to duplicate their work and have
disputed their claim. Some have suggested it resulted from lab
errors.
   Fusion is the process that powers the sun and hydrogen bombs,
fusing atoms rather than splitting them as nuclear reactors do.
   The process, which releases vast amounts of energy, is generally
thought to require temperatures of millions of degrees to get
started. Pons and Fleischmann's purported discovery of cold fusion
held out the prospect of a cheap, safe and practically
inexhaustible source of energy.
   Despite their disappearances, both scientists ``are committed
more than ever to the university and the fusion work,'' said C.
Gary Triggs, an attorney for both scientists, speaking from North
Carolina on Wednesday.
   He would not disclose Pons' whereabouts but said Fleischmann had
returned to his home in England for treatment of an undisclosed
medical condition.
   ``It's nothing major, but he has been undergoing treatment for a
number of years and this is another treatment,'' he said.
   Pons planned to return to the university in a week or so, Triggs
said. He said Pons was requesting the sabbatical because he was
faced with too many distractions while defending the cold fusion
claims.
   ``The only way that is ever going to happen is when they have
the time to dedicate to the science,'' he said. ``Stan and Martin
are scientists, not politicians.''
   Peterson said a decision on the request would be up to the
Chemistry Department. ``There's nothing wrong with a sabbatical and
Stan probably deserves it after all he's been through in the past
year and a half,'' he said.
   The advisory council agenda included an update on the status of
an independent scientific review of the two men's work and comments
from university officials.
   Meanwhile, the state auditor's office has completed its audit of
the institute. State Auditor Tom Allen said some recommendations
have been made, but he would not disclose them until the institute
has responded.
   ``We know pretty well where the money's gone and what it's being
used for,'' said council chairman Raymond Hixson. ``The only real
problem we have is the fact that Dr. Pons and Dr. Fleischmann are
so reluctant to reveal their data - what they've been doing and how
they're doing it.
   ``There will be a gap without Pons and Fleischmann there that
we'll have to fill in later,'' Hixson said.
   Pons departure didn't surprise him, he said.
   ``I can understand why he might want to disappear for a while. I
just wish he'd told me about it,'' Hixson said. ``But I don't think
we need to worry about it.''

<HEAD>Soviet Army Paper Says Rocket Accident 30 Years Ago Killed 165</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army newspaper marking the 30th anniversary of
a rocket explosion says the mishap killed 165 people, including a
leading general, making it the worst known space-related accident
in the Soviet Union.
   The Red Star article on Wednesday said a prototype rocket's
second stage was accidentally ignited on the launch pad, causing an
explosion that burned many of the victims beyond recognition.
   Secrecy has shrouded the accident at the Baikonur Space Center
ever since the explosion shot flames into the Central Asian sky on
Oct. 24, 1960. No official death toll or technical details of the
accident have ever been released, despite several articles
describing the event.
   A monument to the victims lists only 54 names and published
obituaries claimed that Field Marshall Mitrofan Nedelin, commander
in chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, died in an unrelated plane
crash.
   Red Star reported on the accident's 30th anniversary Wednesday,
saying ``the tragedy at the cosmodrome caused the deaths of 165
people.''
   James Oberg, an American expert on the Soviet space program,
said Western observers estimated the death toll to be as high as
300. He said in an interview from his Houston home that many
victims were immediately shipped back to Moscow for burial.
   The newspaper said the rocket was a new design, and Oberg said
he believes it was a new type of missile. He said space officials
told him the explosion came after the first stage failed to ignite,
and technicians tried to replace one component.
   ``Somebody plugged an umbilical cord into the wrong
connection,'' igniting the second stage, Oberg said. The flames
caused fuel trucks to burst into fire, unleashing fireballs.
   People in the vicinity ``just burst into flames like
candlewax,'' he said.
   The Red Star account said the explosion was caused by an
``unnecessary sequence of events in carrying out one of the
operations while the valves of the second stage were opened,
starting the engine.''
   Oberg, hearing the Russian-language version, said it did not
offer a clear technical explanation of the accident.
   The newspaper said the rocket's launch was repeatedly delayed
``for technical reasons,'' including leaking fuel.
   It quotes Stanislav Pavlov, then chief of the launching group,
as saying a few drops of fuel burned holes in technicians' rubber
gloves when the rocket's joints and tubes were checked for leaks.
   ``We didn't pay attention to this, but later we learned it was
dangerous,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Pavlov said he was standing 15 to 20 yards from the rocket when
it exploded.
   ``The site was on fire and full of smoke,'' he told the
newspaper. ``The first thought that came to my mind was `that's it.
The end.'''
   Pavlov said he rushed to a nearby bunker housing the control
center, but was still so badly burned he spent three days
unconscious and one year in the hospital recovering.
   He said his injury was not entered on his official record until
1988.
   Pavlov said he was told Nedelin survived the explosion, bt died
later in the hospital from his burns. He said many of the other
victims were so badly burned they could not be identified visually.

<HEAD>Venus Has Surface Bulges Created by Molten Rock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venus has 600-mile-wide circular bulges
on its surface caused by molten rock pressing up from inside the
planet, the same kind of forces that created Hawaii, a Magellan
scientist says.
   The bulges are as much as a mile high, said Ellen Stofan, a
geologist who analyzes the spacecraft's pictures of Venus at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``You have hot material that rises from deep within the interior
of the planet,'' pushing up overlying rock, she said. The process
``happens over scales of hundreds of millions of years,'' she said
Wednesday.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like sets of concentric
rings. The rings on the bulges are ridges and valleys. Numerous
volcanoes and lava flows dot the bulges, which are called coronas.
   Stofan said the bulges are formed by the same kind of upwelling
of molten rock that created the Hawaiian Islands.
   On Wednesday, Magellan orbited Venus for the 551st time since
arriving at the planet Aug. 10.
   It has used its picture-making radar to peer through Venus'
thick clouds during 288 of those orbits since mapping started Sept.
15. Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989.
   About 30 of the coronas were found on Venus by the Soviet Venera
15 and 16 orbiters in 1983 and 1984. But the Venera spacecraft
couldn't determine if they were bulges or depressions caused by
gargantuan meteorites.
   Magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated radar
that makes much more detailed pictures and can also calculate
surface topography.

<HEAD>Dollar Slides, Stocks Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen today
after a four-day rally, while Tokyo share prices surged again.
   The dollar closed at 127.15, down 1.23 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 128.38. It opened at 126.83 yen and ranged between 126.70
and 127.15 in trading that totaled nearly $10 million.
   After a 13-day plunge of 13.55 yen, the dollar had climbed 3.98
yen in four days.
   ``The dollar's recent upswing did not reflect market reality.
Players realized that the market trend has not changed after all,''
said Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The foreign exchange market has quieted down. By simple
calculation, 126 yen or 127 yen is the happy medium,'' said Minoru
Tsuda of Chemical Bank.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said today that effects of
the recent increase in the central bank's interest rate were
beginning to show, and expressed hope for a stable exchange market.
   Market players had been waiting for some sign from the central
bank welcoming the strong yen, and were depressed by its cautionary
attitude, Tsuda said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 25,352.63 points, up 475.75 points, or 1.91 percent, from
Wednesday's close. Volume on the first section was a relatively
high 700 million shares.
   Despite a setback of 421.42 points on Wednesday, the index has
recovered 5,130.77 points this month from a slide that began in
January. The index approached 40,000 at the end of last year.
   Boosted by the strong yen, the market rebounded today from a
brief drop from profit-taking Wednesday, traders said. Reports that
the long-term prime lending rate would be lowered Nov. 1, the first
decrease in five months, encouraged optimism, they added.
   Japan's huge public works budget made construction-related
issues highly popular safe choices, brokers said. Reports that
Ito-Yokado Co. had bought out the American company Southland, and
in effect the Seven-Eleven food chain, made distribution industry
issues popular, said Yutaka Yoshino of Nikko Securities.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 84.79 points from Wednesday's
84.44-point finish. Their yields fell to 7.745 percent from 7.810
percent.

   A woman who locked her daughter in a car
while at work is otherwise a responsible mother, prosecutors said
in reducing charges against her. Meanwhile, others offered the
woman jobs and babysitting services.
   Chante Fernandez, 24, of Elizabeth, told police she locked her
5-year-old daughter, Anjuli, in her car because she didn't have a
trustworthy baby sitter while she worked weekends at a shopping
mall. She left a rear seat folded down so the girl could sleep in
the trunk area.
   Ms. Fernandez was charged with criminal restraint after her
arrest Saturday and could have received five years in prison and a
$7,500 fine. But on Wednesday the charge was reduced to a petty
disorderly persons offense, which carries up to a $500 fine.
   Prosecutor Alan Rockoff said several concerned people had pushed
to have the charges reduced against Ms. Fernandez.
   ``She didn't abandon the child and allow her to drift with the
elements,'' he said. ``She did check on the child, did try to give
her the necessities and try to make her comfortable during the
course of the day.''
   The girl had been found with such items as a flashlight, a book,
a stuffed toy and a doughnut on Saturday.
   Rockoff said Anjuli, who was placed in protective custody after
her mother's arrest, would be returned to her mother.
   Meanwhile, a lumber company that fired Ms. Fernandez from her
full-time job as a secretary after learning of her arrest said it
was rehiring her.
   In addition, a local babysitting service offered her a special
rate, and the store where she worked part-time said it had offered
her a full-time job and a loan.
   ``We were not aware that she faced such a dilemma,'' said Gary
Lewi, a spokesman for the department store Fortunoff. ``Clearly
from what authorities are saying, this was not a venal act but a
desperate one.''
   Ms. Fernandez told authorities her husband had abandoned her,
her father died in January and her house had been burglarized three
times.
   Ms. Fernandez could not immediately be reached for comment. A
call to her home went unanswered Wednesday.

<HEAD>Humphrey the Wrong-Way Whale Makes it Out Golden Gate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Humphrey, the humpback whale with either
wanderlust or an out-of-whack compass, swam under the Golden Gate
Bridge and out to sea after his latest visit to the City by the
Bay.
   Accompanied by a flotilla of boats, the 40-foot, 45-ton whale
cruised into the Pacific late Wednesday afternoon, bringing cheers
from his human escorts.
   ``He looks happy, like this is where he belongs,'' said Coast
Guard Seaman Walter McCrea.
   Humphrey, drawn for some unknown reason to San Francisco Bay,
tends to overdo his meanderings. In 1985, when the media named him
Humphrey, he took a 25-day tour of the area's inland waters. He has
come back every year since.
   On Sunday, Humphrey returned to the bay and took several more
wrong turns before he wandered into shallow water and spent a day
stuck on a mud flat. After being freed Tuesday, Humphrey swam
toward the ocean.
   Whale scientists have no idea why he goes off course.
   ``My guess is something's wrong with this guy,'' said Brian
Gibeson, a marine biologist at the California Academy of Sciences.
It could be that a parasite has affected his brain or inner ear,
making Humphrey ``like a car with his wheels out of alignment.''
   Most whales stay about 20 miles outside the Golden Gate, but
some like to feed in shallower waters, said Denize Springer of the
Marine Mammal Center in Marin County. ``It's not unusual for whales
to come into the bay. But they usually just take a bite and
leave.''
   Marine biologists feared Humphrey might die while stuck in the
shallows near Candlestick Park.
   A Coast Guard boat tugged Humphrey with a line as wading people
pushed and nudged him until the whale was able to get loose at high
tide. A crowd on shore cheered.

   Congressional negotiators reached a
last-minute agreement on allowing hundreds of thousands of more
immigrants into the country, particularly those with new job
skills.
   The last hurdles to the legislation were removed Wednesday night
when House and Senate sponsors of competing bills agreed to
establish special visas for foreign investors who start businesses
in depressed rural and urban areas and to provide a temporary legal
haven for Salvadorans fleeing violence.
   The bargainers agreed to split the difference between the two
bills on just how much to raise the current quotas.
   ``It's a good blend,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who had
threatened to block passage if more emphasis wasn't put on
screening applicants more for criminal records and needed skills
and deporting illegal immigrants.
   He predicted the Senate would pass the legislation today or
Friday. Aides to House sponsors of the measure said the House would
pass it before Congress adjourns this weekend.
   Current law allows some 490,000 foreigners to immigrate to the
United States each year but requires that 90 percent of them have
close relatives here who already have established U.S. citizenship.
   Only 54,000 so-called ``classic'' immigrants seeking job
opportunities but with no relatives can be let in annually.
   Under the compromise, the total cap would rise to 700,000
immigrants a year from 1992 through 1994 and fall back to 675,000
from 1995 on. The existing preferences for immigrants with needed
professional, job or educational skills would increase to 140,000.
   But the agreement also raises the influx of immigrants allowed
strictly to reunite families from 436,000 a year now to 505,000
annually over the next three years, falling to 480,000 in 1995.
   The United States had few formal immigration policies until the
1920s, when country-by-country quotas were first established. Those
quotas were changed in 1965 to shift the emphasis to keeping
immigrant families together.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., a key author of the House bill and
the compromise, called the new legislation the most comprehensive
immigration package in the nation's history, in that it addresses
both economic and humanitarian concerns.
   ``It includes language to provide temporary protection to
Salvadorans who fear bloodshed in their homeland ..., while
strengthening provisions to exclude criminal and terrorists,''
Morrison said.
   Simpson had vehemently objected to provisions by Rep. Joseph
Moakley, D-Mass., in the House bill that would have granted
three-year stays of deportation of illegal Salvadoran, Lebanese,
Liberian and Kuwaiti immigrants.
   Under the compromise, those people would have 18-month windows
to establish legal status.
   The accord also includes Simpson's demand for 10,000 special
visas for foreign investors who, as immigrants, establish
businesses in depressed rural and urban areas that hire at least 10
American workers.
   In addition, it establishes 40,000 special visas for immigrants
from Europe with distant relatives in the United States who have
been adversely affected by the current policy emphasizing
reunification of spouses and children with their parents.

<HEAD>Principal Militias Agree to Withdraw From Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three principal Moslem and Christian
militias in Lebanon agreed today to withdraw from Beirut and its
suburbs in line with the government's plan to end the 15-year-old
civil war.
   President Elias Hrawi's government obtained agreement from Samir
Geagea's right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia, Nabih
Berri's moderate Shiite Amal militia and Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.
   The pullout area covers what is known as ``greater Beirut'' -
the Moslem and Christian sectors of a capital divided since the
outbreak of the civil war in 1975, as well as its immediate
suburbs.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the ``zero hour for launching the greater Beirut plan would most
probably be set before early next week.''
   Hrawi's Syrian-backed government announced after a three-hour
meeting Wednesday its decision to ``spread state authority'' over
the area but set no deadline for carrying out the plan to create a
militia-free capital.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah - the fundamentalist Shiite Moslem
umbrella organization for groups holding U.S. and other foreign
hostages - today said only that it will announce its decision after
holding talks.
   It did not elaborate.
   On Wednesday, police said Hezbollah, or Party of God, handed
over some Beirut positions to government troops but maintained its
stronghold in the south Beirut slums of Bir Abed, Hay Madi and
Moawad.
   Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul and Defense Minister Albert
Mansour, assigned by the government to follow up the greater Beirut
plan with militia leaders, were to ``put the final touches to the
mechanism of the militias' withdrawal,'' the governmenmt source
said.
   He said the army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud has prepared two
brigades to fill in the vacuum resulting from the militias'
withdrawal.
   The greater Beirut plan was announced 11 days after Lebanese and
Syrian forces crushed rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's 11-month mutiny in
an eight-hour assault on his tiny enclave in the Christian
heartland northeast of Beirut.
   The Oct. 13 assault, which left 550 people dead and 1,200
wounded, forced Aoun to seek refuge in the French Embassy.
   France has granted Aoun asylum, but Lebanon has refused to allow
him to leave along with his main military aides, insisting they
should face a court of law for a variety of charges, including the
alleged theft of state funds.
   Aoun had rejected an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end the
civil war, saying it set no timetable for the withdrawal of an
estimated 40,000 Syrian troops supporting the government.
   The Greater Beirut plan was conceived in line with the peace
plan, which also envisages the disbanding of all the warring
militias throughout the nation.
   The government source said the first step in implementing the
peace plan, after crushing Aoun's mutiny, would be ``achieving the
greater Beirut.''
   ``Disbanding the militias is not an easy step. At present, they
should withdraw to their respective areas of influence far from the
capital,'' the source said without further elaboration.
   The peace pact, which was ratified by Parliament on Aug. 22,
1989, distributes power equally between Moslems and Christians,
effectively shifting some power to the Moslem majority.
   The agreement, however, maintains the presidency for the
Maronite Catholics, the largest Christian sect. The Maronites have
dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.
   Hezbollah is believed the umbrella group for kidnappers of 13
Westerners, including six Americans. The longest-held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Rai  fell along Lake Erie and the Ohio River early today, while
the rest of the nation had mostly dry weather.
   The forecast called for mostly clear skies from the Missippissi
River to the West Coast, except for the Pacific Northwest. A cold
front over Washington and Oregon was likely to bring rain.
   Rain was possible in the Carolinas and central Appalachians.
   The Southwest were expected to have dry and sunny weather, with
temperatures climbing into the 90s in desert areas.
   Temperatures were likely to reach into the 70s along the eastern
edge of the Rocky Mountains.
   High pressure from Texas to the Great Lakes was expected to
bring cold to the northern Plains. Chilly northern winds were
forecast from the Great Lakes to the southern Appalachians.
   The nation's high on Wednesday was 102 degrees at Monrovia,
Calif.

<TEXT>
   Ten bucks can bring you closer to specters
of Spanish settlers, Southwest pioneers and gamblers said to stalk
the narrow, winding streets of this centuries-old city. Just
remember to tie your shoelaces tight.
   Margaret Noblin insisted a few of the folks who have taken the
ghost tour she operates in Santa Fe have had haunting experiences,
but she doesn't guarantee supernatural appearances.
   What she does promise, for a $10 ticket, is at least 90 minutes
of entertaining tales mixing local legends, regional folklore and
haunting history. The stories are delivered at a dozen stops on the
walking tour.
   ``I have to say I haven't ever seen a ghost,'' Noblin said.
``But I've had the hair stand up on my arms in different locations.
... We've had people say they definitely feel a presence.''
   Santa Fe's ghosts tend to be playful, Noblin said. The shoelaces
of a tour participant became mysteriously untied at the same
location twice within a month, said Noblin, who was there for one
of the eerie unravelings.
   ``That same night everybody on the tour smelled a scent - but
nobody had on that cologne,'' she said.
   On a recent night, there were no spirits in evidence as a small
group of visitors made the spooky trek.
   ``Where's the ghost?'' demanded 5-year-old Carissa Rhea,
visiting from Houston with her mother, Vanya. She was disappointed
when a stop at a hotel failed to rouse one of Santa Fe's most
notorious ghosts, that of Julia Staab.
   Mrs. Stabb, the wife of a wealthy 19th-century merchant, is said
to still inhabit the Victorian house, now a hotel, a few blocks
from the plaza where she once presided over large parties.
   Julia's portrait hangs above a marble fireplace in a first-floor
sitting room. The dark-haired beauty wears a look of serenity that
belies the antics with which her ghost is credited.
   Julia's ghost is said to have flung glassware, upended the trays
of hapless waiters and thrown ``a major fit'' when construction
workers tried to move the fireplace, tour guide Betsy Sollitt said.
   Guests who rented Julia's former bedroom were reportedly driven
out in the middle of the night by incessant and unexplained toilet
flushing, according to the guide who uses the name Mariah at work.
   She told of La Llorona, a legendary mother said to have drowned
her children who now wanders the arroyos, wailing her grief at
night.
   Blending history and fable with a theatrical flourish, the guide
also threw in an occasional down-to-earth tip for tourists.
   ``They have a good Thai special here,'' she said of one
restaurant, where the tour stopped to learn about an exorcism held
recently.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign

<HEAD>Residents Fight Plan to Build Supermarket on `Uncle Sam' Home.</HEAD>

   Residents are fighting plans to build a
supermarket near the homestead of Samuel Wilson, the Army meat
inspector during the War of 1812 whose name, legend has it, gave
rise to the term Uncle Sam for the United States.
   Opponents of a planned $8 million supermarket near the remains
of Wilson's home claim the store would spoil the historic site and
destroy the only wilderness park in one of the nation's oldest
industrial centers.
   The four acres the city wants to sell are a wooded area unique
in Troy, a city about 10 miles north of Albany on the Hudson River
that was a pioneer in the U.S. steel industry.
   ``There's a lot of people who grew up near there who use the
park as a relief from the city, a place where nature rules instead
of man,'' Jim Lewis, who organized a protest against the
supermarket in August, said Wednesday.
   State and federal officials last week rejected Troy's plan to
sell the land to Hannaford Bros. of Maine, which wants to build a
Super Shop 'n' Save there.
   City officials and Hannaford are still seeking approval of the
sale.
   Hannaford already owns four nearby acres that include the
foundation for Wilson's home. Supermarket spokesman Stephen Culver
said Hannaford cannot build without the city's four acres.
   Wilson was an inspector who stamped the initials ``U.S.'' on
barrels of salted meat. Legend has it troops claimed that stood for
Uncle Sam, and the name caught on as a symbol of the Army and then
as a national nickname to counter that of England's John Bull.
   The state Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation office
denied the sale because of the visual and environmental impact the
supermarket would have on the park, said Gus Thompson, deputy parks
commissioner. The state will reconsider if the city and Hannaford
revise construction plans, he said.
   The supermarket would be built next to the Uncle Sam house, and
Hannaford has promised to spend $100,000 to beautify the historic
site. About 30 acres of parkland would remain next to the
supermarket.
   But architect Doug Bucher said a huge retaining wall for the
supermarket would hunker alongside the Uncle Sam site.
   ``As an architect involved in visual sorts of things, visually
what that supermarket is going to do to that area is outrageous,''
he said.
   Of the harm to the Uncle Sam site, he said, ``It depends on how
historically significant you consider Uncle Sam. He was a real
character who has taken on a lot of meaning over the years.''

<HEAD>Pioneer Modernist Architect Is Dead At Age 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berthold Lubetkin, an architect who played a
leading role in founding the Modernist school in Britain in the
1930s, has died at age 88, his family said.
   Lubetkin died Tuesday at Bristol in western England, the family
said Wednesday. No cause of death was given.
   The son of an industrialist, he was born in Tblisi in what is
now the Soviet republic of Georgia.
   He was reticent about his early years, saying ``there is no such
thing as a fact.'' But news reports said he was educated in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, witnessed the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917 and absorbed the progressive ideas of
Constructivism prevalent at that time.
   In 1922, he accompanied an exhibition of Soviet art to Berlin
and went on to pursue architectural and engineering studies at
various European centers.
   In 1925, he went to Paris, then the focus of the European
avant-garde movement, and acted as site supervisory architect for
Konstantin Melnikov's dynamic Constructivist Soviet pavilion for
the Paris Exhibition of Decorative Arts of that year.
   In the French capital he met among others the Russian-born
writer Ilya Ehrenburg and the painters Georges Braque, Fernand
Leger and Pablo Picasso and worked with Jean Ginsberg, with whom he
designed an apartment block in the Avenue de Versailles.
   By then a glamorous and exotic figure, Lubetkin came to London
in 1931 and the following year set up Tecton, a co-operative of
young architects committed to radical ideas.
   Modernism was named after the Modern Architecture Research Group
which Lubetkin helped found in 1933. But Lubetkin's first buildings
in Britain were designed not for people but animals.
   In 1932, thanks to the influence of scientists Sir Solly
Zuckerman, later Lord Zuckerman, ad Sir Julian Huxley, brother of
writer Aldous Huxley, he was commissioned to design the gorilla
house at London Zoo and in 1937 the penguin pool.
   The famous pool's composition of curved planes of reinforced
concrete still draws acclaim from students of architecture.
   His first opportunity to build for humans came in 1933, when he
was commissioned to design a luxury apartment block at Highgate in
north London, the capital's highest point.
   Highpoint One, as the block was called, was the most conspicuous
statement of the so-called new ``white architecture'' in Britain.
Many of its details, like the S-curved front to the balconies, went
on to become cliches in the 1950s.
   Lubetkin's London monument to Vladimir I. Lenin, unveiled by the
Soviet ambassador in 1942, was later removed because of repeated
attacks by anti-Communists.
   After World War II, the architect concentrated on designing
homes for blue-collar workers.
   Tecton broke up in 1948 and Lubetkin abandoned architecture to
take up farming in Gloucestershire in western England.
   An often impatient man and an inveterate gambler, Lubetkin
radiated cosmopolitan charm and had an engagingly mischievous sense
of humor. But he was unable to conceal his anger at the direction
taken by post-war architecture.
   In 1982, in belated recognition of his pioneering work, the
Royal Institute of British Architects presented him with its Royal
Gold Medal for Architecture.
   In his acceptance speech, he attacked the architectural style
known as Post-Modernism that flourished after the war as a
``transvestite'' aberration, the ``mumbo jumbo of a hit-and-miss
society.''
   He was equally critical of the style dubbed High-Tech.
   Lubetkin married architect Margaret Church in 1936. She died in
1978. They had two daughters and a son, who survive him.

<HEAD>Christian Fundamentalists Stranded At Moscow Airport</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 250 Christian fundamentalists seeking to
emigrate to the United States have been stranded at Moscow's
international airport for four days, unable to leave or return to
their homes.
   Members of the stranded group said on Thursday they obtained
what they thought were the necessary documents to leave the
country: a Soviet exit visa and a U.S. entry permit.
   However, they said Soviet officials were demanding that they
also obtain an Israeli stamp in their visas, since that is the only
country that allows open immigration from the Soviet Union.
   ``This is hard to understand'' since the group was scheduled to
fly to the United States and take up residence there, said Andrew
Levdonsky, one of the stranded fundamentalists.
   The group of 259 fundamentalists, mostly Pentecostals, passed
through customs checks at Moscow's Sheremetevo Airport, but was
stopped at passport control.
   Since Monday, the group, including dozens of children, has
camped out on benches and on the floor, making do with basic
foodstuffs such as bread and milk supplied by the U.S. Embassy.
   ``We are stuck here, this is like a jail,'' said Pavel Zolnikov.
``Some of the time, they don't even allow us to use the bathroom.''
   Levdonsky said U.S. Embassy officials were trying to get proper
documents for them.
   Another fundamentalist, Ivan Tanasov, said Soviet officials told
them that although they were going to the United States, an Israeli
stamp was necesary because that was the only country now accepting
Soviet emigres without specific invitations from relatives.
   ``All of us have sold our belongings, we have given up our
homes. We have no place to go,'' Levdonsky said.
   The fundamentalists had to give up their passports and
citizenship when they were issued Soviet exit visas, group members
said.
   Tanasov said two groups of Christian fundamentalists left the
Soviet Union last week with no problems and no Israeli stamps. He
feared that others who want to emigrate will find themselves
stranded like himself.

   Congress appears poised to repeal strict
anti-obscenity curbs on the National Endowment for the Arts and
leave allegations of federal ``obscene art'' subsidies for the
courts to decide.
   The Senate dealt a defeat to the endowment's conservative foes
Wednesday night when it rejected, 70-29, a tough new obscenity ban
proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Instead, the Senate voted 73-24 to require the NEA to get its
money back from grant recipients who are later convicted of
violating obscenity or child pornography laws. Guilty artists would
be barred from receiving new NEA grants for three years.
   The House approved a similar measure last week. The Senate's
action virtually assured that the same solution to the ``obscene
art'' controversy will survive when negotiators from both chambers
draft a compromise later his week for final congressional
approval.
   ``Both the House and Senate have rejected extremism in favor of
a reasoned, thoughtful approach,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.,
architect of the House compromise.
   Undaunted, Helms served notice that he hadn't abandoned the
fight.
   Assuming he defeats Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt and
returns to the Senate next year, Helms said, ``I say to the arts
community and the homosexuals who are upset about this amendment
... you ain't seen nothin' yet.''
   The NEA proposal was contained in an $11.7 billion
appropriations bill that the Senate approved Wednesday night for
the Interior Department and several other federal agencies for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Under the Senate bill, the arts agency would get a one-year
extension of life and a $170 million budget through next September.
That is $5 million less than President Bush requested and $10
million less than the House approved.
   The endowment's statutory authority technically expired Oct. 1.
Williams predicted that the new Congress convening in January will
quickly approve a three-year extension of the NEA's life.
   Apart from differences in the NEA's proposed budget, the Senate
bill would allow endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer to continue
requiring grant recipients to sign a non-obscenity pledge. The
House voted to outlaw the pledge, which has prompted three federal
lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.
   The Senate rejected Helms' proposal to forbid NEA support for
works that ``depict or describe, in a patently offensive way,
sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   Later, on voice votes, the Senate rejected another Helms
amendment intended to bar NEA grants for affluent artists, but it
approved a separate Helms proposal to ban federal support for any
work that denigrates religious objects or beliefs.
   The Senate bill as approved would scrap a year-old ban on NEA
support for works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including
depictions of homosexual or sado-masochistic activites, sexual
exploitation of children or ``individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   The judicial formula for settling ``obscene art'' disputes was
proposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, leader of a bipartisan
coalition of liberals and conservatives that included Sens.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Nancy L.
Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Hatch said their compromise was aimed at ``protecting taxpayer
funds and artists' freedom of expression at the same time.''
   But Helms charged that the Senate was ``ducking its
responsibility'' if it relied on the courts to halt the flow of
obscene art.
   ``We're not talking about violins or symphony orchestras or
choral groups,'' he told his colleagues. ``We're talking about
these sleazeballs who have been getting money from the National
Endowment for the Arts under the pretext of having produced
something they call art.
   ``It's a farce,'' Helms said. ``It's worse than a farce - it's a
fraud on the taxpayers of America.''
   The Senate version of the Interior appropriations bill, totaling
$11.7 billion and including the NEA compromise, was approved on a
92-6 roll call and sent to a conference committee with the House
for reconciliation of differences.

<HEAD>Disturbance Disrupts Operation At N.Y. Daily News Printing Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 employees at the Daily News' Brooklyn
printing plant attacked a bus carrying replacement workers after
members of the drivers' union walked out of the plant today,
officials said.
   The workers walked out at about 2:30 a.m. after their business
agent, Seymour Goldstein, was ejected from the plant by management,
said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, a union umbrella group.
   Police said a bus carrying replacement workers was attacked
shortly after 3 a.m. by plant employees outside the printing plant.
No injuries or arrests were reported, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a
police spokeswoman.
   News employees were seen draining radiator fluid from delivery
trucks. The Fire Department quickly put out a small fire set in the
back of a News delivery truck. Another delivery truck was found
gutted by fire.
   Angry employees also blocked the street outside the plan with
about 20 delivery trucks, which were towed by the police.
   John Sloan, Daily News vice president for human resources, did
not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.
   Workers represented by 10 unions at the Daily News have been
working without a contract since March 31.
   Heated negotiations have focused on management's demands for
changes in work rules that they say would give the newspaper
control of its operations. The unions have said the News is trying
to break them and is actually interested in either shutting down or
selling the paper.
   Goldstein said he was making a routine check of the plant when a
dispute began involving one of the drivers. Drivers belong to the
Newspaper Mail Deliverers Union.
   After he backed the driver, Goldstein said, management ``gave me
two choices: leave or be escorted out. They escorted me out.'' The
drivers walked out at that point, McDonald said.
   ``This was an organized plan to lock us out,'' Goldstein said.
``Security is under orders to not let us in,'' he said.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council is made up of the printers,
photoengravers, mailers, machinists, pressmen, paperhandlers,
stereotypers, electricians, drivers and the Newspaper Guild, which
represents reporters and office workers.

<HEAD>China Proposes Death for Pornographers, Drug Smugglers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's legislature proposed today that the death
penalty be imposed for activities related to pornography and drug
smuggling.
   The proposal comes as China conducts a major anti-crime campaign
that already has resulted in hundreds of executions for a wide
range of crimes.
   China also announced a new anti-pornography campaign this week
after destroying 32 million publications in a similar drive last
year.
   Separate draft laws on pornography and drug abuse were submitted
to the National People's Congress' Standing Committee, which meets
between annual meetings of the 2,970-member full congress. The
Standing Committee has about 155 members.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said that under one draft law,
``people who use pornographic materials to carry out criminal
activities might face the death penalty.'' It did not explain
exactly what activities were covered and later specified that
producers and sellers of pornography faced at most life
imprisonment.
   Those who spread pornographic materials to primary and middle
school students must be punished severely, Xinhua quoted the draft
as saying.
   It defined pornography as material that describes sexual
behavior in detail or presents ``obscene scenes.''
   The draft said scientific works and works with artistic value
were not included. A decade ago, China considered even scientific
discussions of sexual relations to be pornographic.
   The second draft law set forth punishments for producing,
smuggling and selling illegal drugs, Xinhua said. It said the draft
called for the death penalty in some cases but gave no specifics.
   Illegal drugs and pornography have increased in China over the
past decade after being nearly eradicated, but neither is nearly as
widespread as in most developed countries.
   China's aging leaders, however, are determined to wipe out what
they consider signs of Western contagion and weakened social
control - both potential threats to Communist Party rule.
   In announcing the new anti-pornography campaign, officials said
pornography was the inevitable result of capitalism and
Western-style democracy.
   China already imposes the death penalty for a wide range of
crimes, and some sellers of pornographic materials and drugs have
been executed. Judges have wide latitude in sentencing.
   However, executions for drug- and pornography-related activities
are likely to increase if laws are passed specifically recommending
it.
   The drafts must be approved by the Standing Committee and the
full congress, which meets in the spring. Drafts sometimes are
worked on for years before being voted on.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
counted more than 650 death sentences reported in the official
media from January to mid-August. Most came after China launched
its anti-crime campaign in late May.
   Most death sentences are carried out immediately after
sentencing, with a bullet to the back of the head.
   From late August to early October, official newspapers reported
114 more death sentences for crimes ranging from murder to stealing
public electrical equipment. In addition, executions are often
carried out without being reported.
   Amnesty International said this year's executions are the most
since 1983, when China launched another anti-crime campaign.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Order Returning Byzantine Art to Cyprus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOUGIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered an art dealer
to return four sixth-century Byzantine mosaics stripped from a
Cyprus church after Turkey's 1974 invasion of the Mediterranean
island.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld an
Indiana court's August 1989 ruling ordering dealer Peg Goldberg of
the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel to return the valuable religious
artwork to Cyprus.
   ``I think it sends a powerful message: In Indiana, you cannot
take title to something from a thief. You can't just go buy this
stuff and expect to keep it,'' said John David Hoover, an
Indianapolis attorney for the Republic of Cyprus.
   Art experts viewed the case as a landmark in a growing effort by
less-developed nations to reclaim and protect national treasures.
The pieces were chiseled from the ceiling of a church in northern
Cyprus, an area controlled by a Turkish-backed government
recognized only by Turkey.
   Ms. Goldberg bought the mosaics from a Turk living in Munich,
Germany, for $1.08 million in July 1988. Religious leaders and
Cypriot officials claimed the mosaics were stolen and sued Ms.
Goldberg for their return.
   Ms. Goldberg's attorney, Joe C. Emerson, would not comment on
the court's decision Wednesday. He said he did not know whether the
art dealer would appeal.
   Ms. Goldberg, who had argued that she attempted to make sure the
works were not stolen when she bought them, did not return a call
after messages were left on her answering machine.
   Chief Judge William Bauer, writing for the court, said the
Turkish government's seizure of property in Cyprus did not
invalidate the Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cypress'
claims of ownership.
   The mosaics, pieced together with painted glass about 525 A.D.,
are fragments of a much larger work on the ceiling of a small stone
church in northern Cyprus. The pieces, roughly 2 feet square,
depict Jesus as a boy, the apostles James and Matthew and an
archangel.
   They are among only a handful of icons surviving the first few
centuries of Christianity.
   Various appraisals place the mosaics' value between $4 million
and $6 million, Hoover said. They are being stored in a private
vault in Indianapolis.
   The lawsuit was filed after Ms. Goldberg tried to sell the
mosaics to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., for $20
million. Marion True, the Getty museum's curator of antiques,
turned down the offer and contacted authorities in Cyprus.
   The court ruled that Ms. Goldberg did not check sufficiently
into the legal ownership of the mosaics before buying them, Hoover
said.
   Ms. Goldberg testified she contacted customs officials in the
United States, Germany, Switzerland and Turkey, as well as the
International Foundation for Art Research, asking if the mosaics
were stolen.
   Bauer called her efforts ``a few last-minute phone calls.''
   Joining Bauer in his opinion was Judge Wilbur Pell. Judge
Richard Cudahay issued a concurring opinion.

<HEAD>Employment Costs Jumped 5.2 Percent Over Past 12 Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wages, salaries and other benefits paid to
American workers rose 5.2 percent in the 12 months ending in
September, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, considered
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures, was pushed
ahead to a large degree by a sharp 6.8 percent rise in benefit
costs for private industry workers.
   The government blamed much of the past year's steep increase on
the rising cost of health insurance. Non-production bonuses,
workers' compensation insurance and a rise this year in the Social
Security tax rate also contributed to the rapid spurt in benefit
costs, the Labor Department said.
   A year ago, benefit costs had jumped 6.0 percent for the
12-month period ending in September 1989.
   Wages and salaries for private industry workers climbed 4.2
percent, the report said, just under the 4.3 percent increase
recorded a year ago.
   The 5.2 percent increase in all compensation costs for both
private sector and government workers was just above the 5.1
percent gain of a year ago, the government said.
   Today's report was sure to add to analysts concerns over the
inflation threat facing the nation and its impact on America's
already struggling economy.
   Last week, the government reported that consumer prices surged
0.8 percent in September, the second steep inflation rise brought
on by soaring energy prices that followed Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   That inflation report showed that for the first nine months of
the year, consumer prices have advanced at an annual rate of 6.6
percent, well above the increase for all of 1989 of 4.6 percent.
   Eventually, analysts expect the inflation brought on by higher
oil prices to start showing up in wages and salaries as well,
because workers will start demanding more compensation to make up
for the drain on their wallets.
   Today's report showed that over-the-year pay gains were about
the same in the service-producing industries, where wages rose 4.2
percent, as in the goods-producing industries, where wages rose 4.1
percent.
   Within the service-producing industries, wage and salary
increases ranged from 2.6 percent in wholesale trade to 6.2 percent
in hospitals and the insurance industry. Pay gains among the
goods-producing industries ranged from 2.4 percent in construction
to 4.6 percent in durable-goods manufacturing.
   Non-union workers received better wage gains than their union
counterparts, continuing a trend that's been ongoing since 1983-84,
the government said. Non-union workers' pay rose 4.4 percent while
union workers saw gains of 3.6 percent.
   For state and local government workers, the 5.3 percent pay
gains for the year ending in September 1990 were lower than the 5.5
percent increases of a year ago. This pattern of lower rates of pay
increases compared to last year also was found in hospitals and
schools, today's report said.
   The 5.2 percent increase in the employment cost index for all
workers, including those in the government, over the 12 months
ending in September was under the 5.4 percent rise in the 12 months
ending in June.

   Western Europe's arms industry, its
orders dwindling in the post-Cold War era, could shrink by nearly a
third by the mid-1990s, the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute said today.
   ``Arms-manufacturing companies will be faced with a shrinking
pie and ... there is no alternative to reducing existing over
capacities,'' the prestigious institute said in a report.
   The institute predicted that within five years up to 500,000 of
the European industry's 1.4 million jobs would disappear and arms
sales will be reduced as much as 30 percent.
   The report says the industry is reacting to talks in Vienna,
Austria, on reducing conventional forces in Europe, the planned
Soviet pullout from Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Warsaw
Pact.
   The 71-page document was written by arms-control experts Ian
Anthony of Great Britain, Anges Courades Allebeck of France and
Herbert Wulf of Germany.
   It said the Persian Gulf crisis has provided no new markets and
orders from developing nations have fallen because they lack hard
currency to buy expensive modern weaponry.
   Such big customers as Egypt, Israel and Syria are reducing arms
imports, and Iraq and Kuwait are under an arms embargo.
   ``Paradoxically, there will likely be a decrease of arms imports
in the gulf area,'' Anthony said, adding that it was unlikely
imports to Saudi Arabia would rise enough for any substantial
effect on the arms industry.
   One reason, he said, was that Western nations were unlikely to
support major exports to Saudi Arabia because of the volatility of
the Middle East.
   European NATO countries bought new weapons worth $32.4 billion
last year. During the same period, the United States bought arms
for $71.8 billion.
   The report says 70 percent of the 100 largest European arms
producers are in Great Britain, Germany and France.
   The European arms industry grew for years until military budgets
leveled off in the mid-1980s. In the years ahead, annual military
budget cuts of at least 2 percent can be expected, the institute
said.
   European arms companies started cutting down three years ago and
some 100,000 jobs have been lost already, the report says.
   The industry is restructuring itself through mergers and
diversification into civilian production. Civilian companies are
being acquired, as in British Aerospace's purchase of automaker
Rover.
   The report lists more than 20 takeovers and eight mergers since
the beginning of 1989. Many deals have been across borders,
including the creation of a French and Italian space company -
Matra Marconi Espace.
   The institute said companies that generate most of their incomes
from the arms sector will be heavily affected by the reductions.
   But not all sectors of the arms industry will suffer.
   The report says Western Europe's future defense is likely to be
based on fewer men and fewer massive tank and artillery units.
Armed forces would consist of smaller, highly mobile units equipped
with high-tech weaponry.
   Arms companies specializing in electronics, helicopter
production and military aircraft appear to have good future
prospects. In addition, production of missiles not included in
arms-reduction talks may grow.

<HEAD>Coal Miners Not Interested in Revamped Government Trade Union</HEAD>

   Coal miners trying to organize the
first mass independent workers union in the Soviet Union said today
they had no interest in belonging to a reorganized government trade
union.
   The National Congress of Trade Unions, the government-sponsored
organization representing 140 million workers, voted Wednesday in
Moscow to dissolve and reconstitute itself as a voluntary
association of unions.
   But the coal miners were not impressed.
   ``It's not a resignation,'' said Viktor Perebanos, co-chairman
of the workers' committee in the Kuzbass coal region of Siberia.
   ``It's a kind of a curtain for the government to influence,
through lower organizations, the trade unions of the people,'' he
said at a miners' congress in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk.
   Delegates representing 2 million miners from throughout the
country were voting today on a draft principle for forming an
independent federation of workers. The miners have shunned state
unions as unresponsive to their needs.
   Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov was scheduled to address them.
He was shouted down and driven from the hall when he spoke to a
similar miners' congress during the summer.
   The Moscow congress, attended by 2,500 delegates, was moved
forward by two years, apparently to coincide with the miners'
meeting in the Donetsk Coal Basin, 600 miles south of the Soviet
capital.
   Its vote to dissolve appeared an effort to counteract the
emergence of a radical miners' union that could repeat the
nationwide strike that threatened to cripple the nation in July
1989.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech to the
government-backed group, said he favored ``strong and independent''
unions that would act ``constructively and responsibly'' during the
transition to a market economy, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   Miners in Donetsk complained the Ministry of the Coal Industry,
which owns all mines and associated industries, was trying to
dilute their organization by underwriting the meeting and excluding
radicals.
   Alexander Adanidi, a member of Kuznetsk Basin Workers'
Committee, which started the 1989 strike, said the ministry tried
to undermine the legitimacy of the congress by contributing $67,000
to sponsor it.
   However, miners from western Siberia, Kazakhstan and the far
north said they would go ahead with plans for an independent union.
   They said they would defer a strike pending resolution of their
complaints by the legislature of the Soviet Union's largest
republic, Russia. The republic's legislature now is session in
Moscow.
   Miners from the Kuznetsk Basin in western Siberia, considered
among the most radical participants in the Donetsk, said they
already had drawn up a draft charter for an independent miners'
union.
   The Siberian union plan envisions a network of independent
unions in various Soviet republics, independent of the government.
   The miners' strikes of 1989 began in protest of working and
living conditions and shortages of such basics consumer goods.
Demands quickly escalated to include regional economic autonomy for
the main mine regions.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov persuaded the miners to return
to work, promising to meet most of their demands. But most of the
promises remain unfulfilled, an issue that has spurred new strikes.

   A jury has begun deliberations in
the case of a winery worker charged with the slaughter of seven
people, including his wife and two of his three daughters, whose
throats were slashed.
   Ramon Salcido could get the death penalty if convicted of
first-degree murder.
   Jurors got the case Wednesday in San Mateo County Superior
Court.
   The prosecution has portrayed Salcido, charged with seven counts
of murder and three of attempted murder, as methodically butchering
the victims in April 1989 in the wine country of Sonoma County. He
was later arrested in his native Mexico.
   Salcido's defense attorney asked the jury to spare Salcido's
life by finding him guilty on lesser counts of second-degree murder
or manslaughter. He argued that his client was in a ``psychotic
depression'' caused by drugs and alcohol and hadn't planned the
killings.
   Salcido, 29, is charged with shooting his wife and cutting the
throats of their three daughters. Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 22 months,
died. Carmina, then 2, survived.
   He also is accused of stabbing to death his mother-in-law,
Marian Richards, 47, and killing her daughters Ruth, 12, and Marie,
8. He is also charged with shooting to death co-worker Tracey
Toovey, 35.
   He is accused of three counts of attempted murder for attacks on
his daughter Carmina; another co-worker, Kenneth Butti; and Butti's
wife, Terri.
   The trial was moved to San Mateo County because of publicity in
Sonoma County.

   Aboriginal leaders in Melbourne
boycotted Nelson Mandela's visit to the city today, saying the
black South African leader should voice more support for their
cause.
   The African National Congress leader, on the third day of a
four-day visit to Australia, attended a fund-raising rally today
and met with state and federal government officials.
   Marjorie Thorpe, chairperson of the Aborigines Advancement
League, said aborigines felt that Mandela could have given their
cause a boost.
   ``We would have liked him to make some statement about
aborigines in this country,'' she said. ``But he has really
disappointed a lot of people in this city.''
   Mandela said earlier he would prefer not to comment on the
plight of Australia's aborigines, or native people, because he did
not want to interfere in another country's internal affairs.
   There were several reports that Mandela may use a planned rest
day in Sydney on Friday to visit with several aboriginal leaders,
but ANC officials would not comment.
   Australia is the fourth stop of a six-nation tour by Mandela,
72. The trip has already taken him to India, Brunei and Indonesia,
and he will travel to Japan and Malaysia before returning home.

   A father-and-daughter team of shepherds have
won a battle to keep raising a bunch of sheep that bleat at all
hours and disturb their neighbor.
   The Howard County Animal Matters Hearing Board ruled that
bleating by sheep is normal in the rural area where John and Karen
Fleishell live and does not disturb the peace.
   The board rejected a noise complaint filed by neighbor Bruce
Snyder against the Fleishells in June, saying the sheep kept him
awake at night.
   ``We're really happy about it,'' Karen Fleishell, a University
of Maryland student who began raising sheep with her father 12
years ago, said Tuesday. ``We didn't think we had a problem.''
   Snyder has said he would accept the board's decision. Tahira
Williams, the county animal control administrator, said the board
reached its decision last week.

<HEAD>Labor Agreements Average 3.3 Percent Pay Gains So Far This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts settled so far this year through
collective bargaining gave workers average annual wage increases of
3.3 percent over the life of the pacts, the government said today.
   The last time parties covered by those settlements negotiated,
usually in 1987 or 1988, wage gains were smaller, averaging just
2.1 percent annually over the contract term, the Labor Department
said.
   Most of the gains reflected pay gains that were larger than
those in previous contracts, particularly for workers in petroleum
refining, food stores, parcel delivery and health services, the
report said.
   In addition, there were pay boosts for workers who previously
had seen pay cuts or freezes in previous agreements, such as for
workers in the steel production industry, the government said.
   For the 12-month period ending in September, settlements that
were reached provided wage adjustments averaging 3.5 percent a year
over the contract life, off slightly from the 3.6 percent peak
reached during the previous 12-month period.
   That peak followed a steady climb in contract gains since a low
of 1.7 percent for a 12-month period, which occurred for the year
ending in September 1986.
   The collective bargaining report showed that workers in
non-manufacturing industries won larger pay gains than their
counterparts in factory jobs. Settlements in non-manufacturing
industries provided average wage gains of 4.0 percent over the
contract life, while pay gains in settlements in manufacturing
industries averaged 2.2 percent over the contract term.
   The Labor Department's broader Employment Cost Index, also
released today, showed workers in service and factory jobs winning
roughly the same size wage gains.
   The average construction worker who fell under settled contracts
received gains of 4.3 percent a year over the life of the contract,
the government said.
   The Labor Department said the 320 collective bargaining
agreements it analyzed in the first nine months of 1990 covered
nearly 1.6 million workers. The government tracks agreements
covering bargaining units with at least 1,000 workers.
   The government said 67 such agreements covering about 207,000
workers are scheduled to expire or reopen for wage negotiations
during the October-December period. They are in a variety of
industries.
   In addition, there are about 938,000 workers under 119 contracts
that had expired or been reopened, but not negotiated or ratified,
prior to the end of September. About 350,000 of those workers are
employed in railroads, 170,000 in the automobile industry and the
others are in a variety of industries.

<HEAD>City Officials Cover Tiny Nude Statues with Fig Leaves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art lovers are not amused by the action of city
officials to cover some tiny statues of nude women on display at
Dallas City Hall with fig leaves.
   The statues by sculptor Future Akins of Lubbock were displayed
as part of a national art competition sponsored by the Dallas
chapter of the Women's Caucus for Art. The exhibit, titled
``Getting Better Ain't Always Easy,'' is to be judged Nov. 2.
   Yvonne Washington, assistant director of the Park and Recreation
Department, said city officials acted on their own instincts, not
as a result of any complaints or public outcry.
   ``I think there was possibly too much shock value,'' she said.
``I'm trying to be sensitive to the whole community.''
   ``Personally, I think it's time for Dallas to wake up,'' said
Bonnie Wilber, president of the Dallas chapter of the women's art
group. ``Bodies are bodies. To me, this is censorship.''
   ``I think it was overreacting and silly and kind of sad,'' Akins
said Wednesday. ``I can't imagine in my wildest imagination how
these pieces would be offensive to anybody.''
   ``I thought we were over this censorship thing,'' she added.
``Maybe Dallas doesn't read the papers.''
   Ms. Washington said her staff contacted the artist and the
artist agreed to have a friend cover the figures with artificial
leaves. One is inscribed, ``Censored 10-23-90.''
   The leaves are large and the figures are small, leaving much of
the work concealed.
   Assistant City Manager Levi Davis, who was consulted about the
decision, said he did not view the action as censorship, but said
all exhibits at City Hall should be ``screened.''
   ``I'm not in a position to evaluate this from an artist
standpoint,'' Davis said. ``The shock factor is that it's next door
to the Office of Vital Statistics and there's a lot of people, a
lot of children, who come through here.''

   China pledged continuing close relations with
Communist North Korea today in a state-approved newspaper editorial
that appeared to dash South Korean hopes for formal Beijing-Seoul
ties.
   The two Communist countries will remain ``as close as lips and
teeth,'' said the editorial, published in the Communist Party
paper, the People's Daily.
   The editorial marked the 40th anniversary of China sending
troops to aid the North in the Korean war.
   The Chinese intervention prevented victory by American-led U.N.
forces fighting on the side of the non-Communist South, and
fighting ended in a stalemate in 1953.
   No peace treaty was ever signed, and the two sides remain
formally in a state of war. The past few months have seen new
high-level North-South talks, but reunification remains distant.
   South Korea has openly pressed for diplomatic relations with
China and was a major sponsor of the Asian Games held in Beijing
this month.
   But China's Foreign Ministry said last week that its policy of
not having political contacts with the South was unchanged.
   The Soviet Union and other East bloc countries have recently
established diplomatic ties with the South while maintaining
relations with the North.
   The front-page editorial in the People's Daily said:
   ``The profound friendship between the Chinese and (North) Korean
people and the friendly, cooperative relationship of the two
countries will be handed down from generation to generation.''
   China marked the anniversary with an unusually lavish
celebration, sending dozens of officials and war veterans to the
North's capital, Pyongyang.
   Li Tieying, education minister and party Politburo member, led
one of three Chinese delegations. North Korea awarded medals to
about 60 visiting Chinese, including the ``Order of Friendship
First Class.''
   High-ranking government and army officials in Beijing held a
symposium Wednesday to discuss the anniversary, and the People's
Daily said participants recalled the war days with nostalgia.

   When Sen. Jesse Helms took to the Senate
floor in Washington to press his case against obscene art and
goverment-subsidized `filth,' Democrat Harvey Gantt sought to turn
the appearance to his own advantage.
   Helms was betting his case against obscene art would fit nicely
into his campaign for re-election.
   Gantt was betting otherwise.
   With polls showing the two candidates locked in a tight race,
Gantt used a campaign appearance Wednesday in Cabarrus County to
criticize Helms for forgetting his constituents while he presses a
far-right agenda.
   At the same time, Helms was on the Senate floor renewing his
attack on the National Endowment for the Arts for subsidizing works
of ``filth.''
   A million dollars has been channeled to ``my opponent in North
Carolina'' by artists who ``claim they have a pipeline to the
pockets of the American taxpayers,'' said Helms.
   Helms put forward an amendment to sharply constrict the NEA's
ability to dole out federal money for works he considers
objectionable. The amendment was defeated 70-29.
   ``These artists who have their minds in the gutter are free to
do whatever they want to do, on their own time and with their own
money,'' said Helms. ``But, no. This crowd wants ... the American
taxpayers to pay for that sort of thing. And this senator says
no.''
   Helms gave a forceful but rambling recitation of the recent
history of the arts controversy. He knocked a court ruling in
Cincinnati acquitting a museum and its director of obscenity
charges for displaying the works of the late photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe.
   Gantt offered a different message.
   ``I want to go to Washington to appeal to something else other
than our worst instincts, our fears,'' the former Charlotte, N.C.,
mayor told 500 people in a packed courthouse. ``I see government as
a partner to improve quality of life, not run your life.''
   Gantt said Helms has gotten so caught up in foreign affairs and
defense spending he has ignored the middle class he purports to
represent.
   ``Why spend $100 billion on the B-2 bomber when our children
need it more?'' he added to loud applause.
   If Helms wants to be the champion of the common man, he should
be supporting day-care programs for working mothers, a higher
minimum wage, and better health care, Gantt said.
   According to Gantt, the campaign is about the politics of
compassion versus the politics of confrontation.
   ``Jesse's always going to stop the bogeyman from coming over the
hill, whoever it is,'' Gantt said in a speech Tuesday. ``Whether it
be communists or gays and lesbians or artists.''
   Helms' broadside against the NEA came amid controversy back home
over a new television advertisement Helms is running. The ad seeks
to link Gantt to homosexual groups, and asserts the Democrat has
raised large sums of money from the gay community.
   Gantt, who is black, suggested that if the clock could be turned
back, the three-term incumbent would be aiming his campaign
rhetoric at blacks.
   ``He'll always come up with somebody, some way to be negative
and divisive,'' Gantt responded. ``But I think those tactics aren't
going to work any more.''
   Last week, Helms grilled Secretary of State James A. Baker III
during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing, accusing the State
Department of having exhibited naivete about the intentions of
Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   He accused the department of abandoning Christians in Lebanon
and allowing the United Nations to infringe on Israeli sovereignty.
   ``What kind of policy do we have when we turn anti-Christian and
anti-Jewish in one week,'' he bellowed as Baker took his seat at
the witness table.
   To Gantt, the tirades are symptoms of the same ill.
   ``We have a senator who is out of touch with North Carolina, who
is more concerned with making an imprint on foreign policy than on
educating our children or cleaning up the environment,'' said
Gantt. ``And it's time we bring him home.''

<TEXT>
   Foreign envoys in Rwanda's capital said
they saw no evidence of a cease-fire today between the government
and rebels.
   The diplomats had no new reports of fighting but said there had
been some Wednesday, when the government-declared cease-fire was
supposed to take effect.
   The state radio reported government troops had killed 320 rebels
and lost 10 soldiers in fighting on Tuesday.
   Ugandan-based rebels from Rwanda's minority Tutsi tribe invaded
last month and advanced to within 40 miles northeast of Kigali, the
capital. The rebels want to overthrow President Juvenal
Habyarimana's government.
   One Western diplomat doubted a cease-fire would hold between the
rebels, who call themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front, and
Rwanda's government.
   ``A cease-fire would mean the rebels would stay where they
are,'' the diplomat said by telephone from Kigali. ``That would
mean giving the rebels part of the country. I doubt Habyarimana
would agree to that.''
   Another Western envoy said he saw no evidence of a cease-fire
and that the government had not announced it in Rwanda.
   The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens told
journalists in Nairobi that Rwanda's government had accepted an
unconditional cease-fire earlier in the day.
   Eyskens said African nations, possibly through the Organization
of African Unity, should provide a neutral force to monitor the
cease-fire.
   He said Belgium, Rwanda's former colonial ruler, would provide
logistical and financial support for such a force.
   Esykens said he had learned of the halt in fighting by telephone
from his Rwandan counterpart, Casimir Bizimungu. Uganda's
president, Yoweri Museveni, announced on Monday that the rebels had
accepted a cease-fire.
   Belgium, France and Zaire sent troops to Rwanda after the rebel
invasion Sept. 30 to protect their citizens.
   The rebels have insisted foreign troops must leave Rwanda before
they would open talks. They also demand Habyarimana's troops stop
killing civilians and that his government release thousands of
people arested as rebel sympathizers.
   The rebels, mainly deserters from Uganda's army, are led by Maj.
Gen. Fred Rwigyema, former deputy army commander in Uganda.
   The insurgency sprang from an estimated 250,000 Rwandan refugees
in Uganda. The refugees largely belong to the minority Tutsis, who
lost power to the majority Hutus in a power struggle in late 1950s
and early 1960s.
   Hundreds of thousands of Tutsis fled to neighboring Uganda,
Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zairem, and 10,000 were reported killed in
the fighting.

<TEXT>
   A right-wing coalition scored a
landslide victory over former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto today,
likely setting Pakistan's struggling democracy on a more
conservative, Islamic course.
   Ms. Bhutto, who claims her August dismissal was a
``constiutional coup,'' refused to concede the defeat of her
center-left Pakistan People's Party in Wednesday's parliamentary
election.
   She accused the army-backed, caretaker government of large-scale
vote rigging, a charge that may be difficult to prove.
   Opponents called the 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto a sore loser and
said the more than 2-1 victory margin by the loose-knit, right-wing
Islamic Democratic Alliance surpassed even their expectations.
   In the final vote count, almost 24 hours after polls closed, Ms.
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party won only 45 of the 216
parliamentary races, to 105 for her opponents. The policy-making
assembly, the lower house of Parliament, elects the prime minister.
   The rest of the seats went to smaller ethnic and religious
parties and independents. Voting was postponed in one race because
of a candidate's death.
   ``The people have given their mandate, their verdict. Ms. Bhutto
should accept the results and prove to the world that she's a
democrat,'' caretaker Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi told a
news conference today.
   A 40-member group of international poll-watchers refused
immediate comment on Ms. Bhutto's assertions of vote fraud, but
said it might discuss its preliminary findings on Friday.
   The group's assessment could affect hundreds of millions of
dollars in vital U.S. aid for the government now headed by Prime
Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi. The United States and other Western
countries have warned they may cut off aid if the election was
rigged and Ms. Bhutto victimized.
   Poll watchers were suspicious of some constituencies where they
witnessed a low voter turnout yet the final vote count showed tens
of thousands had marked their ballots.
   The winning alliance espouses adherence to the principles of
Islam, and there is speculation it could tighten controls on the
media, and restrict the rights of women and non-Moslems. It also
favors a closer relationship with the Islamic world and more
distance from the West, particularly the United States.
   ``I'm angry and shocked at the way election has been rigged. It
wasn't even subtle. They have stolen the elections,'' said Ms.
Bhutto, who predicted a ``witch hunt'' against her family and
supporters would follow.
   The caretaker government has already charged Ms. Bhutto with
abuse of power and had her husband jailed on charges of kidnapping
and extortion. She says the charges are baseless and aimed at
destroying her politically.
   ``Since the polling agents were not present and ballot boxes
were stolen, I cannot accept these results,'' said Ms. Bhutto,
fighting back tears as she talked with reporters Wednesday night in
Larkana, her ancestral home in southern Sindh Province.
   The election was widely seen as a verdict on the Aug. 6
dismissal of Ms. Bhutto's popularly-elected government by President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who claimed hers was the most corrupt and inept
government in Pakistan's 43 years.
   Most analysts and opinion polls had predicted a close race
between Ms. Bhutto's party and its three smaller allies and the
alliance, a coalition spanning the ideological spectrum and united
only in contempt for Ms. Bhutto.
   Yet voter turnout was low, contrasting with the emotionally
charged atmosphere that heralded the return to democracy in
November 1988 after a decade of military rule.
   Analysts said Wednesday's numbers reflected the growing cynicism
about the country's future and disenchantment with both Ms. Bhutto
and her opponents.
   Despite the presence of nearly 100,000 security forces, at least
nine people were killed and 66 others injured in clashes between
rival parties during the voting.
   Alliance leaders who easily won their parliamentary seats
included Prime Minister Jatoi and his son Murtaza; Ms. Bhutto's
chief rival, Nawaz Sharif; and Ijaz ul-Haq, the eldest son of Gen.
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, Pakistan's last military dictator.
   Ms. Bhutto and her mother, Nusrat, were the only winners among
the 11 women candidates.
   The ousted prime minister's controversial and flamboyant
husband, Asif Ali Zardari, won the seat to represent Lyari, the
sprawling Karachi slum, but lost in his home constituency of
Nawabshah in the heart of Sindh.
   The 38-year-old businessman is in jail, being held without bail.
   Ms. Bhutto said she had reports of rigging in at least 80
constituencies and accused the caretaker government of suffing and
stealing ballot boxes and intimidating and harrassing voters to
keep them away from polling booths.
   ``She's a sore loser,'' Haqqani said. ``After a few days she'll
have to accept it.''
   The Western-educated Ms. Bhutto became the first woman leader of
a modern Moslem nation in December 1988 just months after Zia died
in a mysterious plane crash that also claimed the life of the U.S.
ambassador.
   She spent 20 troubled months in office.
   Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown as
prime minister in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later after Zia
refused to pardon him.

   South and North Korea agreed today to
begin talks next month on fielding a single team in the 1992
Olympics and other international sporting events.
   South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong-sung said the two Koreas
agreed to start the talks on Nov. 29 at the truce village of
Panmunjom.
   Chung, reading a joint communique with his North Korean
counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, called for joint Korean teams at the
Barcelona Olympics, the 1991 world table tennis championships in
Japan, and other sports events.
   Kim said the move is part of ``opening the doors to
unification,'' but repeated longstanding demands by the North that
border barriers be abolished.
   The communique capped a five-day trip by North Korean sports
officials and soccer players in the first exchange of inter-Korea
athletic teams across the heavily fortified border.
   The group was the first sports delegation from the Communist
North to visit South Korea since the division of the peninsula in
1945. Their trip followed a visit to North Korea by South Korean
soccer players two weeks ago.

   The American family ritual of changing the
clocks comes around again this weekend.
   Most folks get an extra hour to sleep, or carouse, or whatever
it is they like to do in the wee hours of Sunday morning.
   Of course, that means it's also the weekend some people get
stuck working an extra hour - factory workers and convenience store
clerks, bartenders, police and even some news reporters.
   For most people, though, it simply means having to remember to
set the clock back - that's right, back - an hour before retiring
Saturday night.
   Technically, the change occurs at 2 a.m. local time, which
becomes 1 a.m., and an hour is repeated.
   Or, in the words of the Uniform Time Act, which set up the
system of switching between daylight and standard times, clocks are
``retarded'' an hour at 0200 on the last Sunday in October.
   The move to standard time means that darkness will come earlier
in the evening, with that hour of light shifted back to the morning
hours to get the nation off to work on the right foot.
   Clocks will be ``advanced'' to daylight time the first Sunday of
next April 2.
   While the official switch to standard time covers most of the
nation, a few states have taken matters into their own hands and
exempted themselves. Since those places didn't spring forward to
daylight time last spring, they won't fall back this weekend.
   Included in the nonconformists are Arizona, Hawaii, part of
Indiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

   For the second time in two weeks, the
United States has joined a unanimous Security Council vote rebuking
Israel, this time for not cooperating with a U.N. investigation of
the Temple Mount killings.
   Not even a last-ditch personal appeal from President Bush to
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir persuaded Israel to change its mind
and officially receive the U.N. investigators.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said today that he
would meet the Israeli ambassador ``to confirm their refusal to my
mission.''
   ``If that is the case, that they continue to block my mission, I
will start preparing my report to the Security Council,'' he told
reporters on entering U.N. headquarters.
   Perez de Cuellar said last week that if Israel doesn't cooperate
with the U.N. investigation, he would have no option but to limit
his report to ways of protecting Palestinians in the occupied
territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Top aides to Shamir said today that Israel will ignore the new
U.N. resolution and claimed that Washington was coerced into voting
for the measure to preserve its alliance with Arab countries
opposing Iraq.
   ``We are sorry because this helps Saddam Hussein to distract
attention from what is happening in the gulf ... to what is
happening in Jerusalem,'' said Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner.
   The U.N. resolution, approved 15-0 on Wednesday, is largely
symbolic. No sanctions against Israel are expected, said British
Ambassador David Hannay, who is president of the council for
October.
   Still, Hannay said Israel's treatment of Palestinians ``is not
going to go away from the council agenda ... The principal loser by
not receiving the U.N. mission will be Israel.''
   Israeli security forces trying to quell a riot opened fire and
killed 19 Palestinians on Jerusalem's sacred Temple Mount on Oct.
8. Beforehand Arabs had thrown a volley of stones on Jews praying
below at the Western Wall.
   Israel has since seen a spate of Arab-Israeli revenge attacks.
In response, Israeli authorities sealed off the occupied
territories Wednesday, preventing Palestinians from getting to jobs
in Israel.
   On Oct. 12, the United States broke with past practice and
joined a 15-0 council vote denouncing Israeli security forces for
the shootings on the Temple Mount, in which about 140 Palestinians
were wounded.
   That resolution asked Perez de Cuellar to send a delegation to
investigate and submit a report on the killings.
   Israel fears that accepting the U.N. mission would be tantamount
to accepting world objections to Israel's annexation of
predominantly Arab east Jerusalem, captured with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in the 1967 war.
   The resolution approved Wednesday ``deplores the refusal of the
Israeli government to receive the mission'' and ``insists'' that
Israel ``permit the mission ... to proceed in keeping with its
purpose.''
   The vote was delayed from Tuesday so Bush could contact Shamir,
urging him to receive the U.N. mission so the Security Council
could resume its series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The United States had been under intense pressure from Arab and
other states not to veto the resolution and risk eroding the
fragile coalition arrayed against Iraq, which depends on moderate
Arab states such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.
   The Israeli government denounced Wednesday's resolution in
advance, saying it would not cooperate and calling the council
hypocritical.
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein told reporters the Security
Council was exercising a double standard in criticizing Israel
while Arabs are attacking Jews in Israel in retaliation for the
killings on the Temple Mount, which is sacred to both Moslems and
Jews.
   More than 750 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops
and civilians in the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation.
   The Security Council includes five permanent members with veto
power: The United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet
Union; and the non-permanent members: Canada, Colombia, Cuba,
Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

<HEAD>Attorney General Announces `Southern Star' Capture of 3,743 Drug
Fugitives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international anti-drug crackdown dubbed
``Southern Star'' has resulted in 3,743 arrests and the seizure of
millions of dollars in cash and drugs, authorities said.
   Fugitives on state, federal and international charges from New
Zealand to Bermuda were rounded up during the 10-week effort, along
with $12.8 million in cash, property, drugs, guns and other
contraband.
   The operation marked a new level of coordination between the
U.S. Marshal's Service and 28 state and local agencies in the war
on drugs, said U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh who reported
the sweep Wednesday.
   ``We're making considerable progress in upping the ante for
those who are intent upon feeding the appetite that unfortunately
still exists in the United States for illegal drugs,'' he said.
   But he conceded that the federal government was not in a
position to say if the operation had actually cut into drug sales
in the United States.
   Authorities said those arrested were tracked through 32 states
and several foreign countries.
   Foreign fugitives have too long been able to ``flee from one
country to another, financed by lucrative international criminal
activities,'' said K. Michael Moore, director of the U.S. Marshal's
Service.
   ``They assume that the various law enforcement officers don't
have the time or resources to track them across international
jurisdictions. Operation Southern Star proves them wrong,'' Moore
said.
   Eleven of those arrested were wanted for murder, and one of the
fugitives, Charles Bryatt, was wanted in New Zealand on charges of
cocaine smuggling and conspiracy to supply LSD.
   Along with Bryant, federal authorities singled out several other
fugitives as principal targets of Southern Star.
   Gregory Rodgers, wanted on a Kansas cocaine distribution charge,
was tracked down in the Central American country of Belize and
deported to Miami for arrest.
   One Florida fugitive, Richard Joseph Lynn, was tracked through
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mexico and Guatemala before
he was arrested at a restaurant in Gulfport, Miss.
   The most prominent drug cache seized was 150 pounds of cocaine
that was found underneath imported seafood on a South American
airliner in Miami. Two days later, U.S. Customs Service inspectors
at the same airport found 100 pounds of cocaine from Lima, Peru, in
a box labeled ``books.''

   A powerful earthquake centered in
Afghanistan's rugged Hindu Kush mountain range sent shock waves
throughout the subcontinent early today. Two dozen people were
reported injured in this border city.
   There were conflicting reports on the magnitude of the quake,
which was felt as far away as New Delhi, the Indian capital.
   Russ Needham, a spokesman for the the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it
measured 5.6 on the Richter scale. Pakistan's meteorological center
initially reported a 7 reading, and India's meteorology department
recorded a 6.5 reading.
   The city nearest the epicenter is the war-ravaged Afghan capital
of Kabul, just 60 miles to the south. The Afghan Embassy in
Pakistan had no reports of damage or casulaties in Kabul.
   An estimated 2 million people live in the Afghan capital, many
of them displaced villagers who have taken refuge from the
country's civil war.
   The area of the quake's epicenter, the Laghman province of
Afghanistan, is generally considered the turf of anti-government
Moslem guerrillas.
   In Peshawar, south of the epicenter, buildings shook and
frightened residents ran into the street, Radio Pakistan reported.
It said the quake injured two dozen people in the city.
   In New Delhi, 590 miles southeast of the epicenter, office
workers in high-rise buildings were evacuated as a safety
precaustion, but there were no reports of damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A quake measuring 6 on the scale is capable of severe
damage, and a tremor measuring 7 of widespread heavy damage.

   President Bush took a break from the budget
battles today to escort actress Bo Derek on a tour of the White
House grounds.
   The actress was in town for the Washington International Horse
Show, according to the White House press office. ``She called and
wanted to see the White House,'' said spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Bush had delayed a trip to the West Coast, canceling campaign
appearances in Arizona and New Mexico, because of the precarious
state of negotiations as Congress and the administration sought
agreement on a $500-billion deficit-reduction package.
   The president early this morning averted shutdown of the
government by signing a temporary spending measure that will keep
operations going until midnight Saturday. There were no scheduled
activities on his public agenda for the day.
   But it became apparent that an Oval Office meeting was in
progress when a group of young male White House male aides began to
cluster in the hallways.
   They were soon joined by a gaggle of reporters and
photographers. All pressed against the glass doors looking out on
the Rose Garden for a glimpse of the blonde actress.
   The president was seen escorting her and her husband, John
Derek, along the driveway near the Oval Office.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration believes the Middle
East will never be secure as long as Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
remains in power unless his weapons are destroyed, CIA director
William Webster said today.
   ``Can you put him back in his box?'' Webster asked rhetorically,
referring to Saddam.
   Webster said the administration had ``no real confidence that
the area will ever be secure again as long as he is still there
unless'' a regional, countervailing force is put in place or ``he
is disassociated from his weapons of mass destruction.''
   Webster also said U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq were
beginning to have an effect, forcing Saddam's government ``to take
steps to restructure its economic program in order to feed its
people and meet the needs of the military.''
   Sanctions, imposed after Saddam invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, have
cut off 98 percent of Iraq's oil exports and 95 percent of its
imports.
   Although Saddam has long crushed any internal dissent within
Iraq, Webster said intelligence analysts have received some
``encouraging reports'' of a little dissatisfaction within the
country.
   Webster, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the National Council
of World Affairs Organizations, did not elaborate on the nature of
the discontent and said analysts have yet to conclude how
significant it is.
   Drawing a parallel between Saddam and deposed Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega, Webster noted Noriega was able to stay in power
despite a coup attempt. Noriega was dislodged by the invasion of
U.S. troops last December.
   Over time, Webster speculated there would be growing discontent
against Saddam from his top aides. They are the only ones with
enough access to take action against Saddam.
   The CIA is forbidden under law from taking part in the
assassination of a foreign leader.
   Webster said it was difficult to interpret Saddam's motives
because the leader is isolated, frequently taking counsel only from
his brother.
   But he said Saddam's ``willingness to use weapons of mass
destruction, his ties to terrorist groups, his appeal to Arab and
Muslim solidarity and his playing upon regional economic
frustration' represent a real threat.
   For the time being, Saddam appears to be reinforcing his defense
positions inside Kuwait, Webster said, adding that he was skeptical
about reports and rumors that Saddam wanted to withdraw from Kuwait
with the exception of an oil field and two islands that would give
him access to the sea.
   Saddam's immediate goal apparently is to hold out against
sanctions, hoping eventually to see fissures in the blockade
against him, Webster said.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today the
United States will continue its military buildup in the Persian
Gulf, perhaps adding as many as 100,000 more troops.
   ``We're not at the point yet where we want to stop adding
forces,'' Cheney said.
   He declined to say how many troops might be added to the U.S.
deployment, which now totals 220,000 troops in and around Saudi
Arabia. But when asked if adding 100,000 troops was possible,
Cheney said, ``It's conceivable that we'll end up with that big an
increase.''
   Pentagon sources said Wednesday the deployment would reach the
planned level of 240,000 in three weeks. But Cheney said the
administration ``never put an upper ceiling on the deployment.''
   His comments came as President Bush faced several decisions
about the makeup of the gulf forces and as his top uniformed
commander, Gen. Colin Powell, headed home from talks with ground
commanders in Saudi Arabia. The talks included discussion of adding
more offensive might to the U.S. forces.
   Meanwhile, CIA Director William Webster said the Bush
administration believes the Middle East will never be secure as
long as Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein remains in power unless his
weapons are destroyed.
   He said the administration had ``no real confidence that the
area will ever be secure again as long as he is still there
unless'' a regional, countervailing force is put in place or ``he
is disassociated from his weapons of mass destruction.''
   The U.S.-led multinational forces now total more than 300,000
but still fall far short of the estimated 430,000 Iraqi troops
deployed in heavily fortified positions in occupied Kuwait and
southern Iraq.
   Pentagon planners, noting a recent decline in polls of public
support for the desert deployment, have urged Cheney and other
senior administration officials to articulate their reasons clearly
should they decide to expand the force.
   Cheney said the administration still hoped for a peaceful
solution to the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein but wanted to
make sure its force in the region offered Bush the option of
ordering an offensive.
   ``We want to make certain we've got the forces over there to
deal with any ontingency,'' Cheney said on ``CBS This Morning.'' On
ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' he said: ``We've not yet settled on
an upper limit in terms of our total deployment. So for a number of
reasons I would expect a continuing flow of forces to the gulf in
the period ahead.''
   The Pentagon sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that if more troops were sent to the region they likely would
be heavy tank divisions, either from the United States or Europe.
These sources also said it was possible some non-essential units
might be brought home by Christmas, with the 82nd Airborne Division
a likely candidate.
   Cheney said it was ``entirely possible'' that the 82nd would be
rotated out and additional heavy units sent in. But he said no
decision had been made.
   Even if the United States subbed a tank division for the 82nd,
``we still wouldn't have an offensive force to be comfortable
with,'' a Pentagon source said today. This source said no
additional ground units have been ordered to the region.
   The American buildup hit a symbolic juncture Wednesday with the
arrival in Saudi Arabia of the final elements of the 11th Air
Defense Brigade from Fort Bliss, Texas. It was the last combat unit
scheduled for deployment in the region, Pentagon sources said.
   The only remaining troops scheduled as of Wednesday to be sent
to the area following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait are support
units due to arrive over the next three weeks, bringing the
deployment to 240,000.
   There appears to be little domestic or international support for
a unilateral U.S. offensive, however.
   Barring some action by Iraq that would bring consensus for an
attack, Pentagon sources and military analysts consider it far more
likely that Bush will make small changes to the force.
   ``We would have to double the force there to make an offensive
palatable from a military standpoint,'' said Lawrence J. Korb, a
former assistant defense secretary for manpower in the Reagan
administration. ``I don't think that is very likely. ... I'd set up
a rotation plan but basically keep my troop level about where it
is.''
   The 82nd Airborne is the first candidate to come home because it
was the first to arrive in Saudi Arabia, is lightly armed and not
designed for a tank war. Also, many of its troops spent last
Christmas in Panama as part of the U.S. invasion force.
   Withdrawing the paratroopers, one of the Army's premier
rapid-deployment offensive units, ``would signal that we are going
to hunker down and wait right along with Saddam,'' one source said.
   In addition, a Pentagon official said, ``We'd look good bringing
some people home for Christmas, even if in the big scheme of things
it didn't amount to much.'' This official said the 82nd could be
sent back to the region after the holdidays.
   The Pentagon sources said draft rotation plans call for
six-month rotations for most units, which would mean the first
large-scale substitutions would occur in February. Some units that
are harder to replace ``may have to spend more time in the country
than we or they would like,'' one source said.
   The sequence of the rotations is still under discussion, with an
announcement expected within two weeks, this source said.

   A judge has dismissed a felony charge against
a man accused of engaging in prostitution while knowingly carrying
the AIDS virus, the first charge of its kind in the county
involving a new law.
   Municipal Judge Rand Schrader ruled Wednesday that Demitri
Santangelo, whose infection was found in a court-ordered AIDS test
after a prostitution conviction, was not properly warned he could
be charged with a felony if he was arrested again for prostitution.
   Santangelo, 29, could have been sentenced to three years in
prison if convicted of the felony charge.
   Schrader, 45, who describes himself as the only openly
homosexual judge on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, was elected
chairman of the Los Angeles County AIDS Commission last year.
   The case was the county's first involving a 1988 law that the
Legislature passed after a Los Angeles jury acquitted a man of
knowingly selling AIDS-contaminated blood to a plasma center.
   Deputy District Attorney Vivian Davidson said she would have to
research whether there are grounds for appeal.
   Santangelo's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Patrick Thomason,
applauded Schrader's ruling and predicted it would withstand
appeal.

   British officials are expressing horror at the
IRA's latest tactic - taking a family hostage and forcing one
member to drive a bomb-laden vehicle into an army checkpoint in
Northern Ireland.
   The IRA attacks on checkpoints at the border with the Irish
Republic on Wednesday killed six British soldiers and a civilian
and injured 35 people.
   The attacks were expected to dominate Irish-British talks in
London today.
   Police in the Republic of Ireland questioned eight men today
about a series of attacks including IRA bombings in Northern
Ireland. A spokesman for the Irish police, the Garda, said six of
them would appear in a special criminal court in Dublin on
unspecified charges.
   But the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
charges were not in connection with Wednesday's bombings. The eight
men were arrested near the border with Northern Ireland after
Wednesday's attacks.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, the British Cabinet
member responsible for the province, said on Wednesday that the
Irish Republican Army had ``sunk to new levels of depravity by
using people, whose families have been held hostage, as human
bombs.''
   ``It is hard to imagine anything more evil than tying a man into
his car laden with explosives and then forcing him to drive to
where the bomb was detonated,'' he told the House of Commons.
   In new violence today, the outlawed paramilitary organization
Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed responsibility for the killing of a
man whose body was found by two schoolgirls in a Protestant housing
project in south Belfast.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the 28-year-old Protestant
man had been questioned by police Wednesday about terrorist acts.
He was the 10th person to die in political and sectarian violence
in the British-ruled provinc  in four days.
   Brooke, Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins, and police chiefs
from both sides of the Irish border were to take part a meeting in
London today under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
   Meetings are regularly held under the accord, which gives the
Irish Republic a formal consultative role in the running of
Northern Ireland and provides for cooperation between security
forces on both sides of the border.
   Police in Northern Ireland said that in simultaneous pre-dawn
attacks Wednesday, the IRA forced three Roman Catholic civilians it
said had collaborated with security forces to drive bomb-laden
vehicles to their targets.
   Five soldiers died in the attack on a army checkpoint near
Londonderry, 65 miles northwest of Belfast.The body of Patsy
Gillespie, who drove the bomb-laden van while IRA guerrillas held
his family hostage, was found Wednesday night at the scene of the
blast.
   Another soldier died in a similar attack on a army checkpoint
near Newry, 35 miles south of Belfast.
   But in that case, the man who drove the bomb-laden van while the
IRA held his relatives captive managed to flee the vehicle and
shout a warning before the explosion.
   In a third attack, on an army base at Omagh about 50 miles west
of Belfast, guerrillas strapped the driver into his bomb-laden
trailer, told him to drive to the target and followed in a car
while other guerrillas held his family captive. But the man managed
to get free and the bomb failed to go off.
   Hospitals said a total of 35 people, including two 9-month-old
babies, were injured in the Londonderry and Newry attacks.
   Police in the Irish Republic said today that they were holding a
total of eight men arrested Wednesday under anti-terrorist
legislation just across the border from the checkpoint near
Londonderry.
   But they refused to say if the men are believed connected with
the attack. They can be held without charge for 48 hours.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted
unnamed security sources as saying it was thought the eight were
arrested in a process of eliminating possible suspects from
investigations in the area.
   In a message to news organizations, the IRA claimed
responsibility for the three attacks.
   It said the three men forced to drive the bombs were
collaborators because they had performed construction work for the
security forces.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

<HEAD>Man Aquitted of Killing Detective in Drug Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury today found a man innocent of
killin  a Boston police detective in a case that raised questions
about whether investigators lied and doctored evidence.
   Albert Lewin, 34, a Jamaican immigrant, was accused of firing
the shots that blasted through a closed apartment door and killed
Detective Sherman Griffiths, 36, during a drug raid on Feb. 17,
1988.
   The Franklin Superior Court jury deliberated for 3 hours and 40
minutes over two days before acquitting Lewin. The case was moved
to this western Massachusetts community because of pretrial
publicity.
   Former Detective Carlos Luna, who was a partner of Griffiths,
testified that police lied in an attempt to cover up the
inadequacies of a search warrant used for the drug raid. Luna is
one of two officers indicted for their alleged role in the coverup.
   Luna testified at Lewin's trial that his superiors and a Boston
prosecutor encouraged him to concoct a story that a supposed
informant named in the search warrant had either died or left town.
In fact, police have admitted, there was no such informant named
``John.''
   In his final arguments, defense attorney Max D. Stern maintained
the Boston police forfeited their reputation in trying to build a
case against Lewin.
   ``Trust is a precious commodity,'' Stern said Wednesday. ``It is
not in endless supply and when officers of the law bend that law,
when they twist that law, when they break that law ... they do not
deserve that trust any more.''
   Assistant Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas J. Mundy
acknowledged that the evidence against Lewin, who was in an
apartment with several other people, was circumstantial.
   The only physical evidence linking Lewin with the murder weapon
was a fingerprint on the gun. And Stern sharply challenged the
authenticity of the print, which surfaced 30 months after the
crime.
   An FBI expert testified he discovered the print and was
convinced it was authentic. But two defense witnesses, including a
retired fingerprint expert with the state police, testified there
were signs the print may have been transferred onto the gun.

<HEAD>Qualified Support for Albania's Quest to Join Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania's Balkan neighbors today gave
only qualified support for its quest to take part in European
affairs, and Greece insisted the isolated, hard-line Communist
nation make human rights reforms.
   Albania's attempt to gain international acceptance also was
damaged by the defection today of its most famous author to France.
   The author, Ismail Karare, announced he would seek political
asylum because there ``was no possibility of legal opposition'' in
his homeland.
   Word of Karare's defection reached Tirana just after the foreign
ministers' meeting closed, and there was no immediate official
Albanian reaction.
   Albania, the host of its first high-level international
conference in decades, hopes to be invited to join the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe in time for its summit
meeting in Paris next month.
   But Balkan foreign ministers today did not give Albania a clear
endorsement for partipation in the summit.
   The ministers said only that they ``welcomed the request of
Albania for full participation in the CSCE, and expressed their
wish to see it realized.''
   Albania was the sole European nation not to sign the Helsinki
Final Act in 1975, the document that began the European conference
process.
   To be admitted, Albania is likely to have to take human rights
reform further than it has to date.
   Reforms introduced this year have slightly eased the complete
ban on religious activities and have allowed a few thousand of the
country's 3 million citizens to travel abroad.
   But the Communist Albanian Labor Party has given no signal it
will tolerate other political parties or allow freedom of
expression.
   ``We need some tangible proof that they are indeed walking this
path,'' said Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece, the only
country to publicly take Albania to task for its human rights
record at the two-day meeting.
   With Kadare's defection, Albania is even less likely to get
enough support from the 34 nations in the conference - the United
States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all the rest of Europe - to
participate fully at the Paris summit.
   Kadare, the head of the Albanian Writer's Union, had been seen
as one of Albania's leading reformers.
   Albania's quest to take part in Europen affairs places its
rulers in a difficult position. They can either accelerate reform,
which could provoke violent upheaval, or approach the change
gradually and thus fail to make the desired foreign contacts.
   This summer, about 5,000 Albanians took refuge in embassies in
Tirana and eventually were allowed to emigrate.

   Five freed Americans enjoyed a homecoming that was overshadowed
by fears for colleagues still held captive in Iraq, and nine more
former U.S. hostages were flying to the United States today.
   In Washington, CIA director William Webster said today the
Middle East will never be secure as long as Saddam Hussein remains
in power - unless the Iraqi president's weapons are destroyed.
   Regarding the French hostages, Western diplomatic sources in
Baghdad said French citizens given permission this week to depart
Iraq will begin leaving on Saturday. More than 300 French citizens
are among the thousands of foreigners who were trapped in Iraq
after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   France has said it would not make any concessions in exchange
for the freeing of its nationals, but the Iraqi government-run
daily newspaper Al-Jumhouriya said today that France would withdraw
some of its forces from the Persian Gulf region. It cited
unidentified, official sources in Paris.
   France has about 5,000 troops in Saudi Arabia, plus an estimated
2,000 sailors aboard 14 ships in the region as part of the
predominantly American multinational force.
   U.S. military strength in the gulf region, now totaling about
220,000 troops, could grow substantially in coming weeks, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said today.
   ``We're not at the point yet where we want to stop adding
forces,'' Cheney said on ``CBS This Morning.'' Asked if adding
100,000 troops was possible, he said, ``It's conceivable that we'll
end up with that big an increase.''
   Congressional sources said Cheney and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III had disclosed an offer by Iraq to free Canadian and
German hostages in return for high-level diplomatic visits from
those countries.
   The sources said Cheney and Baker briefed lawmakers in a
closed-door meeting on Wednesday. Saddam invited the Canadian and
German foreign ministers to visit his country and held out the
prospect that some of their nationals could be released if they did
so, House members were told.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said the reported entreaties to U.S.
allies ``are viewed by our guys as cynical, exploitative of the
hostages, and I think Congress agrees with that assessment.''
   Webster, meanwhile, told the National Council of World Affairs
Organizations that Saddam's ``willingness to use weapons of mass
destruction, his ties to terrorist groups, his appeal to Arab and
Muslim solidarity and his playing upon regional economic
frustration'' make him a continuing threat to long-term peace in
the gulf region.
   The five American men who arrived in the United States on
Wednesday were freed by Iraq for medical reasons. They arrived at
New York's Kennedy Airport aboard a Royal Jordanian Airlines
flight.
   Freed hostage Jack Frazier, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif., said
leaving his fellow hostages behind ``was the hardest thing I've
ever done in my life.''
   ``I'm very elated to be at home,'' said Lloyd Graham, 48, of
Houston. ``The celebration won't start until all our friends and
colleagues can come home, too.''
   Nine other freed Americans stayed in London overnight and were
expected to fly to the United States later today. The hostages'
release came after a meeting Sunday between Saddam and members of
the Washington-based American-Iraqi Foundation.
   Saddam, who seized Kuwait in a dispute over money, land and oil,
prevented thousands of foreigners from leaving Iraq and the
conquered emirate, and has used some as human shields to protect
key installations against potential attack.
   In other gulf developments:
   -Oil prices jumped more than $2 per barrel in early trading on
the futures market today on fears of a confrontation in the
Mideast. Light sweet crude oil was up $2.17 to $33.25 per barrel
for December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, a key market, late this morning. Oil prices were about
$21 a barrel before the invasion.
   -President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt arrived in Oman today on the
last leg of a regional tour. ``No one wants war, but at the same
time legitimacy must be established and the law of the jungle must
not prevail,'' he was quoted as saying in officially distributed
statements.
   -Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said Cairo's allies in
the Gulf Cooperation Council have agreed to forgive Egyptian debts
totaling $7 billion. Egypt has the largest Arab contingent in the
multinational force, with about 15,000 troops deployed in the gulf
region.
   -Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's gulf envoy arrived in
Damascas today. The envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, said he was carrying a
message from Gorbachev to Syrian President Hafez Assad. Primakov's
diplomatic mission has taken him to Baghdad, Washington, Rome,
Paris and London.

   A bureaucratic goof gave beer drinkers a

   The Finance Ministry had ordered the hike to take effect
Thursday, but ignored a law saying changes in costs of
price-controlled commodities - such as beer - need the signature of
both the finance and trade ministers.
   ``Apparently somone forgot to prepare the order for the two
ministers to sign,'' Finance Ministry spokesman Eli Yosseph said.
   He said the order would be signed by both ministers on Sunday,
when a sales tax increase from 20 percent to 40 percent will take
effect to bring Israel in line with European nations.

   Lithuania might restore diplomatic relations with

the Soviet Union, the republic's president was quoted as saying
Thursday.
   The official Tass news agency said President Vytautas
Landsbergis discussed the possibility during a recent visit to
Hungary.
   It quoted him as saying the Hungarian government accepted his
proposal ``to develop relations between the two states on the basis
of the 1937 Lithuanian-Hungarian Treaty which remains in force.''
   Lithuania was the first of the 15 Soviet republics to declare
independence from the Soviet Union. The Baltic republic agreed to
suspend its March 11 declaration in exchange for the lifting of an
economic embargo and the Kremlin's agreement to negotiate.
   Officials have held two rounds of talks and agreed to try to
start formal negotiations on secession at the end of November.
Lithuania was independent for a brief period after World War I, and
was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.

   A former Ugandan vice president detained
for more than three years on various charges was freed Thursday for
lack of evidence.
   Paul Muwanga's freedom came after prosecutor Mark Kabega told a
Kampala magistrate's court the state had no evidence to support
charges of kidnapping with intent to murder, but that
investigations would continue.
   He said the charges could be reinstated if sufficient evidence
is found.
   Muwanga, 69, was accused of committing the offense in 1981. He
was vice president under former President Milton Obote, who was
toppled in a 1985 military coup.
   Muwanga, who was arrested in October 1986, has remained
imprisoned except for period court appearances. He was charged with
treason against the present government and with abuse of power
while in office under Obote, but was subsequently acquitted.
   Muwanga was de facto president in 1980 when he chaired a
military commission that ruled the East African nation after a
combined force of Ugandan exiles and Tanzanian troops ousted
dictator Idi Amin in late 1979.

<HEAD>Italy's EC Presidency Under Scrutiny On Eve of Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis has
become a familiar figure in recent months as he travels the world
to espouse his vision of a Europe ready to throw its weight on the
international stage.
   De Michelis has used Italy's presidency of the European
Community to promote a series of ambitious initiatives and
proposals, ranging from a Mediterranean peace conference to an EC
military role.
   Italy's six-month term, which has drawn criticism from some
diplomats recently, reaches an important stage this weekend at a
summit meeting of the 12 EC leaders in Rome.
   De Michelis says the officials will discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis, the EC's relations with the Soviet Union and other East
European countries and the process of economic, monetary and
political union.
   As the head of government, Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti will
chair the summit. But the real guiding force behind Italy's
activist EC presidency has been De Michelis, a rotund, ebullient,
rapid-fire talker who relaxes after council meetings by going disco
dancing.
   Among the projects he has promoted:
   -The Pentagonal Initiative, a grouping of Italy, Austria,
Hungary, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia designed to bolster
political and economic development in central and Eastern Europe as
a counterweight to a unified Germany.
   -A similar alliance of four West European countries and five
Arab states of North Africa to work for political and economic
stability in the Mediterranean region.
   -A joint proposal with Spain to hold a conference on peace and
security in the Mediterranean - possibly extending to the entire
Middle East - on the lines of the Helsinki conference on European
security.
   -A proposal for the EC to assume a formal military dimension by
absorbing the Western European Union, a body which loosely
coordinates defense policies of nine EC states.
   -A proposal for a meeting of EC and Arab foreign ministers to
discuss the gulf crisis.
   Of these, only the Pentagonal Initiative seems to have achieved
success.
   The proposal for a Mediterranean peace conferenee has been
stalled by the complexities of the Middle East conflicts. The idea
of an EC military arm has been opposed by neutral Ireland, while
Britain and other states say NATO should remain the lynchpin of
European security.
   Perhaps most embarrassing for De Michelis was the cancellation
of a scheduled meeting in Venice earlier this month of EC and Arab
League foreign ministers. Several Arab states refused to come
because Iraq was not invited. De Michelis says he still hopes the
meeting can be held, perhaps in November.
   Sniping against Italy's chairmanship has grown in recent weeks.
   The British magazine, The Economist, said that while De Michelis
has generated many ideas, diplomats believe he is unable to
``channel them constructively.''
   ``Italy's presidency is proving like a bus trip with the Marx
Brothers in the driver's seat,'' The Economist quoted a senior
Brussels diplomat as saying.
   ``A lot of talk but little action,'' is how The Wall Street
Journal summed up the view in Brussels.
   Italy has brushed off the criticism, arguing that Europe needs
to be more active in keeping up with the rapid changes in the
world.
   Italy has always considered itself one of the staunchest
advocates of European unity and integration. In a referendum last
year, more than 80 percent of Italians supported the idea of giving
the European Parliament powers to draft a new treaty of European
Union.
   When Italy took over the rotating EC presidency in July, the
main priority was to speed up the community's process of political,
economic and monetary integration.
   But since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the EC has been forced
to deal with issues of security and Europe's role beyond its
immediate borders.
   While the EC members swiftly agreed on sweeping economic
sanctions against Iraq, the consensus frayed over the military
response to back them up. Only Britain and France have committed
ground troops to the multinational gulf force.
   This weekend's summit will bring together the 12 EC leaders for
the first time since the gulf crisis began, but it was not planned
that way.
   The meeting is listed as an emergency summit, even though it was
scheduled before Italy took over the presidency. Rome apparently
wanted to keep up with its predecessors, France and Ireland, which
called emergency summits to deal with changes in Eastern Europe and
German reunification.

   Police vexed at the folk-hero following of
Lawrencia ``Bambi'' Bembenek say the convicted killer showed her
true colors when she created a phony identity after her prison
escape.
   Ms. Bembenek, a 32-year-old former model, Milwaukee police
officer and Playboy club waitress, was captured earlier this month
in Canada, months after breaking out of a Wisconsin prison. She was
serving a life sentence for murder.
   She had faced a deportation hearing today in Thunder Bay,
Ontario, where she was captured Oct. 17. But the hearing was
delayed for a week this morning after he lawyers requested more
time to prepare their response to illegal immigration charges and
also sought to bar news media from the hearing.
   ``There is a tradition in Canada that we try people in court; we
don't try them in the media,'' said David Dubinski, a lawyer for
Ms. Bembenek.
   Adjudicator Carmen DeCarlo delayed a decision on media access
until next week and told Ms. Bembenek's lawyers they'll need to
present arguments then if they need further delays for the
deportation hearing.
   Ms. Bembenek had claimed she was framed for the killing, and
supporters who argued she deserved a new trial cheered her escape
in July and took to wearing ``Run, Bambi, Run'' T-shirts.
   But authorities said Wednesday a bogus resume she used to find
work in Canada shows her capacity for deceit.
   ``It certainly does take a little of the luster off the Bembenek
legend,'' said Fond du Lac County sheriff's Lt. Ed Sheppard.
   The resume identified her as Jennifer Voelkel Gazanna, born Jan.
7, 1961. A child named Jennifer Lee Voelkel - born the same date -
died at one month and was buried in a Milwaukee cemetery. Police
said Ms. Bembenek may have obtained the dead child's birth
certificate and used it to establish a false identity.
   The resume said she was a prison social worker for nine years
and served as a member of the governor's advisory council on AIDS.
It also contained a bogus educational background.
   Ms. Bembenek, 32, was fired from the Milwaukee police force for
lying on a report. Prosecutors convinced a jury she killed her
husband's ex-wife in 1981 because she disliked the amount of
alimony the woman received.
   After a tip from someone who recognized her from the TV show
``America's Most Wanted,'' she was captured in Thunder Bay, where
she was working as a waitress. Her fiance, Dominic Gugliatto, 35,
also was arrested.
   A private detective trying to help Ms. Bembenek get a new trial
said authorities were desperately trying to besmirch her claims of
innocence.
   No one who escaped from prison would tell the truth on a resume,
Ira Robins said. ``That is absolutely ridiculous.''
   The Milwaukee investigator said he has evidence that Ms.
Bembenek was framed because she had knowledge of police corruption,
but he complained that few are willing to listen.
   ``There has been no investigation of the corruption I have
pointed out,'' he said. ``I am trying to get a woman some
justice.''

   Managers of an apartment complex have forced most
residents to remove American flags flown in support of U.S. forces
in the Persian Gulf, saying the flags were a safety hazard.
   Two veterans groups denounced the apartment management as
unpatriotic.
   Most residents of the Plantation Apartments were defiant
Wednesday, saying the management was being un-American. But by the
end of the day, most complied, removing the small flags that have
been flying since mid-September.
   About 30 residents had displayed the flags, which hung from
30-inch wooden poles outside near the apartment doors. Residents
were given notices Monday and Tuesday to remove the flags or
maintenance workers would dispose of them.
   Apartment officials said they will allow flags to be displayed
on doors and windows as long as they don't create a hazard.
   ``We, like the residents who are complaining, are behind our
boys in the Mideast all the way,'' said Sylvia Rizk, chairman of
Houston International Management Co., which manages the complex.
   ``Patriotism should never be abused by using it as a reason to
disregard safe practices.''
   The safety concern, Rizk said, was that the flags jutted into
passageways even though they were hung well above eye level. The
management company also complained that residents had drilled holes
in exterior walls for the flags.
   Joe Coyle, spokesman for Kor-Vets, the Texas Chapter of the
Korean War Veterans Association, said the order to remove the flags
was unpatriotic, whatever the reason. He said his organization
would back any residents who want to fight the move.
   The national president of the Brotherhood for Vietnam Veterans,
who is a Houston resident, also denounced the management company's
actions.
   ``It causes me to wonder just where the priorities are for these
folks living in this country,'' Sibley Cooley said. ``Obviously
these people who wanted to fly the flags wanted to fly it because
they had a deeper sense of commitment and patriotism.''

   Retired sheet metal worker Ben McAbee
knows politics is rarely pretty. But lately, he says, what's been
going on in Washington has been downright disgusting.
   ``I think people are getting plumb fed up with it,'' McAbee
said.
   From California, where 20-year-old Monique Osborne said simply,
``I think it's way bad,'' to Maryland, where Vincent Broco
described the U.S. government as a ``circus,'' anti-Washington
sentiment is running deeper than the deficit.
   In Tampa, there's a group called ``Throw the Rascals Out.''
Radio call-in shows across the country hear strong anti-Washington
sentiments. The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune set up a phone line for
readers who want to complain. Newspaper ads have suggested that all
incumbents be tossed overboard.
   The showdown over a new budget between Congress and President
Bush has been about as popular as Roseanne Barr's rendition of the
National Anthem. The District of Columbia is now the District of
Contempt.
   ``They would have to clean Washington right out completely and
start over,'' said Don Hart, who was running errands Wednesday in
downtown Traverse City, Mich. ```Disgusted' isn't the word. `Mad'
would be a better one.''
   Many everyday Americans interviewed around the country this week
said they were following the budget battle closely, and didn't like
what they saw. From Bush on down, no one appeared immune to wrath.
Politicians' performances seem to have gotten worse over the years,
people said, and this year is the worst yet.
   ``I'm pretty upset about it actually,'' said Neil Tucker, a
34-year-old commercial real estate broker in Baltimore. ``We elect
these people to represent us and they're more concerned with their
special interests and getting re-elected than voting their
convictions.''
   ``I blame leadership,'' Tucker added. ``I blame the people in
Congress. They're all basically a bunch of jokers.''
   ``I'm not going to vote for a single incumbent,'' said Tomas
Martinez, a New Mexico state government clerk who lives in
Albuquerque. ``I think it's time to give others a chance. ... Maybe
they'll think more like a consumer, like a taxpayer, rather than
remaining in office feathering their own nest.''
   Polls show public confidence in government is at a two-decade
low, and Bush's approval ratings at their lowest levels of his
presidency.
   Congress' approval ratings are even lower - a Newsweek poll
found 52 percent would be willing to fire the whole Congress. And a
recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found a record 79 percent of
those surveyed said the country is on the wrong track.
   ``They've got no respect for us and we've got no respect for
them,'' said farmer David Guise, who runs a fruit stand outside
Dallas. ``It's a helluva mess. Washington has got too many
millionaires in there, and they don't care about the working man.''
   ``As far as pointing fingers, I think it's everybody's fault,''
said Art McArdle, who administers a surveyor's apprenticeship
program in Oakland, Calif. ``It's an appalling situation. I think
the problem is they've known that this was going to happen and they
didn't take the bull by the horns soon enough.''
   ``Yes, I'm following it,'' construction worker Gary King in Des
Moines, Iowa, said of the budget battle. ``I've been following it
for 12 years and it seems like it always falls on the working-class
man. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.''
   At the Diplomat Mall in Hallandale, Fla., a senior-dominated
Broward County city, Laura Goldman said: ``We're all watching it.
Look, we're on fixed incomes. They're talking about increasing the
cost of Medicare? They should decrease it.
   ``I don't think it will ever be straightened out. I have
grandchildren, and I worry about that budget deficit for them.''
   Larry Nusbaum, an artist displaying his acrylics on the Santa
Fe, N.M., plaza, blamed the American people more than Congress or
Bush for the budget fiasco. The public makes so many conflicting
demands on the federal government, he said.
   Nusbaum said his opinion of Congress ``wasn't very high to begin
with, but I can understand their dilemma.''
   ``It's not Congress, it's us. They receive the messages from us.
We get the government that we deserve. You can blame the government
all you want to, and that doesn't cut the cake,'' Nusbaum said.
   Tax increases expected in the new budget are a particular sore
spot.
   McAbee, the Texas retiree who sells handmade pillows and quilts
from a roadside stand, complained that the rich should shoulder a
heavier burden. Increasing cigarette, gasoline and beer taxes will
hit the working-class hard, he said.
   ``They didn't tax wine because that's what they drink,'' McAbee
said. ``But some poor bastard who has to buy gasoline to drive to
work and have a cold beer when he gets home, they're going to tax
him to death.''
   ``It's politics,'' said Hart in Traverse City, Mich. ``We don't
have any statesmen anymore. All we have is politicians.''

<HEAD>Sudan Faces Mass Starvation, U.S. Relief Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starvation of ``apocalyptic'' proportions is
endangering as many as 11 million Sudanese but their government is
blocking international food deliveries, U.S. relief officials said
Thursday.
   Administration officials, testifying before the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said Sudan's military government
refused to recognize the danger and has derailed a U.S.-led rescue
under U.N. auspices that would have saved many Sudanese from
hunger.
   ``The government in Khartoum has been increasingly indifferent
if not overtly hostile to the relief efforts,'' said Andrew
Natsios, the administration's top relief official.
   Due to drought and civil war, this year's harvest could fall
short by as much as one million metric tons, leaving up to eight
million Sudanese to starve, he said.
   Other relief organizations put the number of those in danger as
high as 11 million, said Roger Winter, director of the private U.S.
Committee for Refugees.
   ``If the actual level of need is as high as some people fear,
and the donor community is not allowed to respond, we are looking
at an apocalyptic situation worse than in Ethiopia in 1984,'' said
Natsios, Director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. An
estimated 250,000 Ethiopians died of hunger in that famine.
   About 75 percent of the Sudanese at risk live in government-held
territory, and the rest in rebel-held lands in southern Sudan.
   U.S. officials accuse the government, which seized power in a
military coup 16 months ago, of preventing food from reaching the
south where the Sudan's People Liberation Army has been fighting
for autonomy since 1983.
   The SPLA, too, has used food in its war, shooting down relief
planes and attacking trains and truck convoys carrying food from
neighboring Kenya.
   Sudanese planes last month bombed several towns in the south
which serve as center of Operation Lifeline Sudan, prompting the
United States to temporarily suspend its sales of wheat to the
government and to recall Ambassador James Cheek to Washington for
consultations.
   But the government has also prevented food supplies from
reaching areas it controls and has spurned U.S. urgings to call for
international help. As a result of this attitude and of the
harassment of relief workers, Natsios said, European donors have
all but stopped helping.
   The United States, Natsios said, is willing to provide one-third
of an emergency 300,000-ton food shipment needed to avert mass
starvation. An estimated 50,000 tons of U.S. donated food are
already been stored in Sudan, he added.
   But unless the Sudanese government allows relief workers to
distribute the food and turns to the international community for
more help, ``we will not be able to respond in time if the call for
help goes out after people start dying.''
   Winter said he traveled to Sudan last month ``out of concern
that famine of biblical dimensions was building.'' He suggested the
United States lead a campaign for international economic sanctions
against Sudan's government, of the type imposed on Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait.
   But administration officials doubted this would be much help.
   The United States has stopped everything except emergency aid to
Sudan and so ``levers of traditional pressure are not available,''
said Jeffrey Davidow, acting Assistant Secretary of State for
Africa.
   ``And there's not much of an economy left that we can embargo,''
added Natsios. Civil war, years of government incompetence, and
isolation by the world community have wreaked havoc on Sudan's
economy, he said.
   Sudan's military suppliers are Iraq, Libya and China - countries
with which the United States has little influence, Davidow said.
   Officials predict the arms flow from Iraq will be limited by the
international embargo on President Saddam Hussein. The Sudanese
government has also been cut off by other benefactors - Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait - as a result of its support for Saddam, the
officials said.
   ``I would like to emphasize that Sudan's position on the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis does not affect in any way'' U.S. relief
operations, Davidow said. ``We are not using food as a weapon.''

<HEAD>Sales Of Existing Homes At Slowest Pace In Nearly Three Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declining consumer confidence and the Persian
Gulf crisis pushed September sales of existing homes down 8
percent, a real estate trade group reported Thursday. It was the
slowest pace in nearly three years.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales totaled a
seasonally adjusted 3.22 million houses, the slowest pace since a
3.20 million rate in January 1988.
   All regions posted sales declines except for the Northeast,
which was unchanged from an already low level. The August rate had
been 3.50 million.
   Realtors President Norman D. Flynn said declining confidence in
the economy has been fueled by uncertainty over the impact of
federal budget legislation and the Persian Gulf situation.
   ``Consumers don't know what to expect,'' Flynn said. ``When
people don't know what's coming, they tend to delay big-ticket
expenditures. Many of them put their home buying plans on hold.''
   The South led the sales decline, falling 10.0 percent to an
annual rate of 1.26 million units.
   In addition to consumer confidence, Realtors chief economist
John A. Tuccillo said the deployment of military troops from
Southern bases to the Persian Gulf decreased demand for houses and
upset the local economies.
   ``The military pullout has taken more buyers from the
marketplace than the ones sent overseas,'' Tuccillo said.
``Companies in those areas that rely on military business are
hurting. The economic fallout has interrupted purchase plans of
civilians.''
   The Commerce Department next Tuesday will report on September
new home sales. Sales of new homes fell 1.4 percent in August to a
550,000 annual rate.
   Thomas Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said higher interest rates, rising unemployment and
the uncertainty of Middle East developments will keep the housing
market sluggish for months to come.
   But Holloway said the September existing home sales ``was not as
negative as shown on the surface.''
   Noting the jump in sales to 3.5 million units in August, he said
the average of the two months comes out to 3.3 million houses -
``right in line'' with the level of sales in the previous four
months.
   According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged between 10.19 percent and
10.22 percent in September. The rates generally were higher than
the average during the first half of the year.
   ``Buyers scaled back their purchases partly because of slightly
higher rates,'' Flynn said. ``But economic uncertainty played a
much bigger role.''
   The median price of an existing home nationally fell 2.9
percent, to $94,300. The median means half of the homes cost more,
half less.
   The West posted a resale rate of 520,000 units, down 8.8
percent. The median home price was $134,700, a 3.9 percent decline
from August.
   Sales in the Midwest were off 7.1 percent, to 920,000 units. The
median price was $74,000, a 1.7 percent drop.
   Sales in the Northeast remained unchanged at 520,000 despite a
5.6 percent drop in the median price to $137,100.
   The median price in the South was $85,900, down 1.2 percent from
August.

<HEAD>Brazil Sends Quick Message: No Imported Faxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil has rejected a proposal to
remove fax machines from a list of products barred from import - a
list that includes personal computers and automatic bank teller
machines.
   The decision Wednesday night by a government commission, over
the objections of Brazil's communications secretary, keeps the
facsimile mail machines among imported items banned in an effort to
encourage local manufacturers.
   Communications Secretary Joel Rauber said it was unfair to keep
Brazilians from acquiring imported machines, which cost less than
one-third the price of domestic models.
   A thriving industry has sprouted up in smuggled faxes. Federal
police often make surprise baggage inspections at international
airports - not for drugs or machineguns, but for faxes and laptop
computers.
   Federal agents also raid offices demanding to see local receipts
for faxes and computers. If proof of Brazilian manufacture is not
forthcoming, police seize the machines.
   Rauber had argued that fax machines had become ``part of
everyday office use and personal communications.''
   The government's Computer-and-Automation-Policy Council didn't
get the message.
   Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg, who also is
the head of the council, said allowing imports of faxes would wreck
Braziliarm bill after the GATT talks end on Dec. 31.
   The National Grange has said the $13.6 billion cut ordered for
USDA programs represented ``unilateral disarmament'' by the United
States in the trade talks. The Grange's national master, Robert
Barrow, said the costs of trimming the budget deficit should be
borne more equitably.
   Rob Nooter of the American Farm Bureau Federation's Washington
office said Wednesday that the farm bill and its tie to the $500
billion budget-reduction package is ``certainly going to have an
impact on farm income.''
   Some of the income lost from reduced deficiency payments will be
made up by other features of the 1990 farm bill, but not all of it,
he said.
   Federation President Dean Kleckner said last week that he wasn't
happy with all of the farm bill but urged its adoption.
   ``Although farm program budget cuts are disproportionate, and we
accept them with great reluctance, the bill will continue
agricultural market orientation and give farmers greater planting
flexibility,'' he said.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The 1990 farm law will be a prime topic of
discussion as the Agriculture Department unlimbers its annual
outlook conference next month.
   It will be the 67th USDA meeting for economists, farm leaders,
commodity experts and others to look at what may be forthcoming in
the year ahead. This year's session is Nov. 27-29.
   The opening day will include talks by Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleberger, conference officials said Wednesday.
   They will be followed by Sidney L. Jones, assistant secretary of
the treasury for economic policy, who will present the economic
outlook for 1991. USDA officials will discuss prospects for
farmers, consumers and agricultural exports.
   Other first-day events will include a panel discussion on
European and Soviet Union affairs.
   Commodity prospects and the outlook under new farm legislation
will be highlights during the remainder of the conference, along
with environmental and energy issues.
   Among the forecasts will be USDA's first for consumer food
prices in 1991, and its predictions for exports and farm income.
   The impact of higher oil prices will be a major factor in the
1991 farm income forecast. Energy also will be important in looking
ahead at retail food prices.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Production of farm-raised catfish dropped 9
percent last month from a year earlier to 27.6 million pounds,
according to a monthly report by the Agriculture Department.
   However, the report said the average price paid by processors to
growers in September was 78 cents per pound, up 13 cents from a
year ago.
   On a cumulative basis, catfish farmers delivered about 277.8
million pounds of catfish to processors through September, compared
with 255.3 million pounds in the same nine months of 1989.
   Imports of freshwater catfish, mostly from Brazil, are down from
a year ago. The report said imports in August, the most recent
month calculated, totaled 362,000 pounds, down 14 percent from a
year earlier.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Privatization Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NADIA RYBAROVA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Thursday
overwhelmingly approved a law to put into private hands about
100,000 small shops and enterprises that were nationalized during
four decades of Communist rule.
   The privatization process is a key part of reforms aimed at
transforming Czechoslovakia's centralized economy into a
Western-style one guided by market mechanisms.
   The law was approved by 202 of the 239 deputies present and
voting, the state CTK news agency reported.
   Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, who presented the draft to the
legislature Wednesday, said it was a compromise ``which cannot
satisfy all completely.''
   The measure will apply to some 100,000 shops and small
enterprises with an overall value of about $83 million, equivalent
to nearly half the nation's annual budget.
   Thousands of vendors across the country staged symbolic strikes
last month demanding they be given first crack at buying the shops.
They wanted to pay up to half the purchase price in installemnts
spread over a seven-year period.
   The vendors were afraid they would be shut out by people with
large amounts of capital to invest - foreigners, or onetime
Communist functionaries who amassed fortunes under the former
government.
   Although the government draft would have given employees of the
enterprises being bought the option of installment payments over
five years, the version approved by Parliament scrapped that
provision.
   Auctions will be held in two rounds, with the first round open
only to Czechoslovak citizens and those who emigrated after the
Communists came to power in 1948.
   Shops and enterprises which are not sold in the first round will
proceed to the second, in which some foreigners will also be
allowed to bid.
   The bidding will begin at prices determined by the government.
The minimum price acceptable for any shop sold is 50 percent of the
government-proposed amount.
   If the second-round auction is attended only by Czechoslovak
citizens, the minimum purchase price required will be 20 percent of
the original amount.
   The new law is to take effect on Dec. 1, CTK said.
   Privatization of large industrial plants and the agricultural
sector is expected to begin in early 1991.

<TEXT>
   A terminaly ill man seeking the right to die
won a court ruling Thursday that says doctors must consider his
request not to be connected to a life-support machine should the
need arise.
   Tel Aviv District Court Judge Uri Goren ruled that doctors would
not face criminal charges if they accepted 50-year-old Binyamin
Eyal's request, even if the patient was unconscious at the time.
   Eyal's lawyer, Shir Adonevitch, said the ruling could set a
precedent in Israel. ``For the first time ... a district court
recognizes the right of a man over his body,'' Adonevitch said.
   Eyal's wife, Pnina, told Israel radio she was thankful for the
ruling. ``It manifests the last wish of my husband, which is to die
with honor, without any needless torture. He has suffered enough,''
she said.
   The plaintiff sued for the right to order his doctor to avoid
prolonging his life by artificial means after he loses
consciousness. Eyal suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It is an incurable illness
that causes the breakdown of the muscular system.
   Dr. Nahman Wilenski, who is treating Eyal, recently told the
Jerusalem Post that his patient was having trouble breathing, but
he could not say when he would need a respirator.
   The ruling said the decision whether to connect Eyal to an
respirator would be left to the director of the hospital where the
plaintiff is being treated.

<HEAD>9 Years And Many Delays Later, Man Found Guilty Of Rape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who claimed he was suffering from
post-Vietnam stress was convicted for a second time today of the
1981 rape-kidnap of a woman who went public with her ordeal after
years of delays and a retrial.
   A jury found Robert Percy guilty on all four counts in the 1981
attack on Sue Kremelberg.
   ``God, yea!'' Kremelberg said, her fists raised in the air,
after the jury read its verdict. She and her family then hugged in
the courtroom.
   Percy was accused of raping Kremelberg in 1981 while out on bail
after raping an Essex attorney, Susan Sweetser, just weeks earlier.
   In both cases Percy was convicted of rape by a lower court. In
both cases, the Vermont Supreme Court sent the cases back for
retrial. The state's highest court recently upheld Percy's second
conviction in the Sweetser case.
   For 10 years the women have been forced repeatedly to return to
a Vermont courtroom to recount their ordeals. And outrage over that
experience prompted them to go public with their cases earlier this
year.
   ``I want people to know the outrage,'' Kremelberg said recently.
   Their accounts, in turn, have prompted calls for reforms in the
Vermont judiciary that has allowed the cases to drag on through
trials, state Supreme Court hearings and retrials.
   Vermont Attorney General Jeffrey Amestoy, in a note to Sweetser
the day the court upheld Percy's conviction in her case, wrote,
``Nine years late. May my daughters have your courage and may they
have a fairer and faster criminal justice system.''
   Percy does not deny raping Kremelberg, but says he was insane at
the time, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and
reliving a Vietnam War flashback.
   Percy's lawyer, James Dumont, pointed in closing arguments
Wednesday to the testimony of psychiatrists, which he said showed
Percy was ``wounded in the brain'' by his Vietnam experience.
   But prosecutor Phillip Cykon said Percy was in control of his
actions at the time of the attack.
   ``The Vietnam War is not on trial here,'' Cykon said.
``Post-tramatic stress disorder alone is not enough to excuse
criminal behavior.''
   Kremelberg faced Percy for the second time in the courtroom last
week. Her voice calm, but at times in tears, she recounted for the
jury her nine-hour ordeal on the night of Jan. 16, 1981, when she
stopoped at a garage in Stowe where Percy was an attendant.
   She testified that Percy told her to back her car to the air
pump, located in a darker section of the station's lot, because her
left tire looked low. She said Percy then jumped into her car,
pulled out a gun and forced her to drive away. She was tied up and
raped twice before Percy fled.

   Yale University efforts with lab mice could
lead to a vaccine against Lyme disease in humans, and perhaps
against syphilis as well, researchers say.
   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, a Yale
team reported that a Lyme disease vaccine for mice was made with a
gene-engineering technique that could be applied to other diseases,
such as syphilis, that are caused by a type of bacteria called
spirochetes.
   ``It's very likely that we'll be able to get a good vaccine for
humans from this technique,'' said Richard A. Flavell, leader of
the Yale team. ``If it works on this disease, then it may be used
to develop vaccines against other diseases with spirochetes, such
as syphilis.''
   A Harvard researcher, however, said that the success of a Lyme
disease vaccine, even for mice, cannot be proven until the immunity
is tested against disease in the way it is naturally spread -
through a tick bite.
   David H. Persing of the Harvard School of Public Health said
that the saliva of Lyme disease-infected ticks also contains
substances that depress some immune functions. A vaccine would be
proven, he said, only when it is shown to give protection against
the effects of these substances also.
   Lyme disease was first identified in 1975 and named for the
Connecticut town where a Yale study was conducted. The disease is
spread by a small deer tick that passes along the spirochete when
it sucks blood from a victim. The disease can cause heart problems,
arthritis-like joint pain, skin rash and even brain disorders.
Identified early, Lyme disease can be successfully treated with
antibiotics.
   Flavell said that to develop the Lyme disease vaccine, the Yale
scientists first had to find a special inbred strain of laboratory
mice able to contract the disease. He said Stephen W. Barthold, a
Yale veterinary scientist, found that a mouse strain called C3H/He
could be infected with the Lyme disease spirochete and develop
symptoms within five days.
   To make the vaccine, the Yale researchers cloned a gene for a
protein, called OspA, that is on the surface of the Lyme
spirochete.
   The gene was then spliced into a common laboratory bacteria that
then produced the OspA protein.
   A purified form of OspA was injected into a group of mice and
tests showed that the rodents developed antibodies to the protein.
   Inoculated mice then were injected with the Lyme spirochete.
   Mice that had been injected with the OspA protein did not get
Lyme disease. Antibodies made by the mouse immune system in
response to the OspA protein were able to keep the bacteria in
check. Other mice that had not received the OspA shots developed
the Lyme symptoms.
   Dr. Erol Fikrig, a member of the Yale team, said the study
required injecting the bacteria because the researchers had to know
exactly how much spirochete each mouse received. Using a tick to
spread the disease, he said, ``would be highly variable and could
not be reproduced'' precisely.
   Fikrig acknowledged that the laboratory test of the vaccine is
not a true test of its effectiveness against the tick-born disease.
   ``In nature, things could be different and further studies on
that will have to be done,'' he said.
   The importance of the study, he said, is that some immune
protection was demonstrated against a spirochete bacteria.
   ``The fact that we can make a vaccine against this organism is
certainly encouraging that vaccines against other spirochete
illnesses can be developed as well, and that includes syphilis,''
said Fikrig.
   Flavell said it will take five to eight years of additional
laboratory work before the experimental Lyme disease vaccine can be
tried on humans.
   Science, which is publishing the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   Nearly 3,800 rare books and historic
documents have vanished from the Wroclaw University library,
apparently sold abroad under the guise of academic exchanges, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The thefts were discovered early this year by German researchers
working on the collection that came into Polish hands when the
German city of Breslau became the Polish city of Wroclaw at the end
of World War II.
   Government auditors and the prosecutor's office have launched an
investigation and asked the university rector for disciplinary
proceedings against library employees, as well as to start putting
the collection in order, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper.
   The library houses one of Europe's largest collections of books
from the Middle Ages among its 1.5 million volumes, the newspaper
said.
   Auditors said the thefts occurred even after they started their
inspection of the library.
   Investigators concluded that traditional inter-library exchanges
of books between universities for academic research were being
exploited for commercial purposes, according to Gazeta Wyborcza.
   Between 1986 and June 1990, 3,793 manuscripts were sent abroad
and sold without appropriate permission, the newspaper said.
   It said it was impossible to determine the prices the documents
sold for because the dealings were not recorded by the university
accounting office.
   The customs declarations offer few clues because in 860 cases
they state the materials were being exported for free exchange and
did not have cultural value, according to the report.
   Poland has strict laws about exporting pre-1945 antiques,
artwork and other items designed to protect the country's cultural
heritage.
   Other investigations have shown, however, that loose controls on
museums, the financially beleaguered state of cultural
institutions, and abuses by authorities led to the disappearance of
many treasures from national art and museum collections during the
Communist regime.
   The government auditing bureau also suggested the collection was
not properly cared for because it wasn't Polish.
   ``The essential reason for this negligence is an inappropriate
approach to formerly German collections, by both employees of the
library and the scientific staff of the university,'' the auditing
bureau said.

<HEAD>Women Get Pregnant After Menopause with Test-Tube Fertilization</HEAD>

   The latest medical technology lets women turn back
their biological clocks and get pregnant after menopause, but also
raises questions about how old is too old for child rearing.
   Doctors say they can extend women's baby-making years well into
their 40s, 50s and perhaps 60s, providing a second chance for those
who waited too long to start families. However, some doctors have
doubts about the wisdom of childbearing for those who are well past
nature's own cutoff.
   ``Because we can do something technically does not mean we
should do it indiscriminately,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks. ``The
ability to become pregnant is a physical sign of what nature itself
expects of a woman. You cannot push nature past the point where you
interfere with safety.''
   Rosenwaks is head of the fertility clinic at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, one of several hospitals around
the country that has begun using the new technology.
   The process, described in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, is a variation on the now-routine process of in vitro
fertilization, conception in the lab dish. Ordinarily, doctors
remove eggs from an infertile woman's ovaries, mix them with sperm
and then put the embryos into her womb.
   However, this is not possible if the woman's ovaries have
stopped working, the change of life known as menopause. Until
recently, that was the end of the reproductive line for women.
   But now, doctors are removing eggs from healthy young donors and
implanting them in older women after they have been fertilized with
sperm. Because the mother does not provide the egg, she is not the
genetic parent of her baby, but still undergoes a normal pregnancy
and delivery.
   The major limits to the technique are the health of the mother
and the cost - $8,000 for each attempt plus a $1,500 payment to the
egg donor.
   In the journal, Dr. Mark V. Sauer of the University of Southern
California described the use of the technique on seven women over
40 whose ``ovaries didn't last as long as their desire to have
babies.''
   Menopause usually occurs around age 50, but in about 10 percent
of women the ovaries stop working by age 40. Sometimes these women
have delayed having children, often while they establish their
careers.
   ``Many women are coming in 40 years of age or older. They have
an air of desperation. It's their last chance,'' said Dr. Anne
Wentz, who has a ``geriatric infertility'' practice at Northwestern
University.
   Pregnancy is riskier for older women than young ones. They are
more likely to have high blood pressure, premature labor and
bleeding. Wentz and others noted that there is simply no way to
know the effects of carrying and delivering a child on a women in
her 50s and beyond.
   ``We don't have any data on that. It opens up a Pandora's box,''
said Dr. Steven Bayer of New England Medical Center.
   Others noted that older women should carefully think about
whether they have the stamina to deal with 2 a.m. feedings and
other rigors of bringing up babies.
   ``There is concern about progressively older individuals trying
to provide parenting for an infant and a child as it grows up,''
said Dr. Machelle Seibel of Faulkner Hospital in Boston. ``I have
no right to say what is the right age, but at some point there has
to be limits to what age is appropriate.''
   Dr. Kamren Moghissi of Wayne State University added, ``Some of
them won't live to see their kids get married or even graduate from
college. The natural lifespan for women is around 80 years, but
some women die at age 60 or 65. These women obviously won't see
their children grow up.''
   While the image of the ticking biological clock became a
familiar one for young professional women in the last decade, there
is some evidence of a reversal in the popularity of postponement of
childbearing for a career.
   A Time magazine poll of 505 Americans ages 18-24 taken last
month by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman found 51 percent put having a
long and happy marriage and raising well-adjusted children ahead of
career success.

   Congressional leaders, in virtual agreement on
major tax issues, sought spending compromises today as they neared
completion of a deficit-reduction plan that has the tentative
support of a majority of lawmakers and President Bush.
   However, despite the apparent agreement, Republicans today were
emphasizing remaining differences among negotiators.
   ``There's nothing the president has signed off on yet. It's not
just one issue. There must be two dozen important issues that
haven't been resolved,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
said after an afternoon White House meeting.
   Still, Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., declared ``do not despair;
the end is in sight,'' as the House and Senate inched toward final
adjournment of the 101st Congress.
   Bush, who averted a partial shutdown of the government by
signing a temporary spending measure to keep operations going until
midnight Saturday, said it was time to get the budget crisis
``behind us.''
   At a Rose Garden picture-taking session with GOP leaders
designed to try to show resurrected GOP unity, Bush said he was now
ready to turn his full attention to campaigning for GOP candidates.
   ``We are totally committed in our determination to send a sound,
strong Republican message across this country,'' Bush said. ``We've
been bludgeoned by a bunch of demagogic attacks by the Democrats
for months,'' Bush said.
   But even that unity seemed fragile.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who abandoned Bush on the original
budget agreement, was invited to the unity session but still
refused to pledge support for the emerging package.
   ``Since the plan doesn't exist, despite your myopic focus on it,
I don't think any of us have an obligation to tell you in advance
what we would do'' in terms of voting for the package, Gingrich
told reporters.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was satisfied
with the overall final package that was emerging, although there
were still some details to be worked out.
   ``There have been compromises on both sides,'' Fitzwater said,
noting that the package meets Bush's overall goal of a
$500-billion, five-year budget package.
   A senior administration official, briefing a group of reporters
on the condition of anonymity, said Bush expected wide bipartisan
support in both chambers for the budget deal.
   Assuming no unexpected hitch, final votes on the
deficit-reduction package could come Friday in the House and
Senate. That would close another chapter in a long-running fight
between the executive and legislative branches and remove the major
obstacle to adjournment - barely a week before the Nov. 6
elections.
   ``We still have a lot of work to do,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters
as leaders began another series of closed meetings to work out the
budget plan.
   The plan will mean higher taxes on tobacco, alcoholic beverages,
airline tickets, cars, boats, furs and jewelry. A gasoline tax
increase of 5 or 6 cents a gallon is likely and retirees probably
will have to pay more for Medicare coverage.
   Several changes whose details were still being negotiated will
mean heftier income taxes on those with higher incomes, especially
those above the $100,000-a-year range. But a provision that would
have raised taxes on lower-and middle-income Americans by forgoing
next year's scheduled inflation adjustment in income taxes was
dropped.
   Leaders of both parties embraced broad outlines of the
deficit-reduction compromise Wednesday after Democrats dropped
demands that it include a special surtax on the rich.
   Negotiators said sizable problems remained to be worked out on
spending for Medicare, Medicaid and farm programs.
   The talks have produced preliminary agreement on major tax
issues ncluding:
   -Raising the top tax rate on the wealthiest people to 31 percent
from the present 28 percent. The 33 percent rate paid by
upper-middle-income people on some of their earnings would drop to
31 percent.
   -Phasing out the $2,050 personal exemptions for single people
with taxable incomes over $100,000 and couples above $150,000.
   -Permitting writing off only 97 percent of otherwise allowable
deductions against any portion of adjusted gross income over
$100,000 a year.
   -Setting a maximum tax rate of 28 percent on capital gains,
which are profits from the sale of investments. That would mean a
tax cut for those whose gains are now taxed at 33 percent but would
fall far short of the general capital-gains tax cut that Bush has
demanded.
   The bill that contains tax increases and restraints on Medicare
and other mandatory spending would cut the deficit by about $250
billion over the next five years. Another $250 billion would come
principally from scaling back military spending and cutting
interest expenses by reducing government borrowing.
   Even with that package, government spending is expected to total
$1.2 trillion during the 12 months that end next Sept. 30 and the
deficit still would be a record $250 billion. The bill envisions
that today's federal debt of $3 trillion-plus will soar to $5
trillion by the end of the five-year period.
   The emerging compromise has bipartisan support in the Senate and
backing from a clear majority of House Democrats. However,
vote-counters ay House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois
will be lucky to get 50 of the 176 GOP members behind the plan,
despite Bush's pleas. Most House Republicans adamantly oppose any
tax increase.

   Police sold Bjorn Borg's villa at a
forced auction Thursday after the former tennis star failed to pay
more than $3.75 million in debts, Sweden's TT news agency reported.
   The three-story villa, in the Stockholm suburb of Nacka, fetched
$1.9 million from Lars Nilsson, a hotel owner from southern Sweden
who said he would use it as a summer house.
   The villa lies near the Stockholm archipelago and had been
valued at between $2.1 million and $2.7 million, the news agency
said.
   Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, has had financial troubles
since his attempts to build a clothing empire failed two years ago.

   SUPERIOR, Wis. (AP) - Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot sent a
check for $2,500 after a group raising funds for a new ice arena
asked for an autographed item for a celebrity auction.
   Superior made Lightfoot an honorary citizen when he performed
last year at nearby Duluth, Minn.
   Mayor Herb Bergson said it would have taken quite a few items to
produce as much money for the Superior Amateur Hockey Association's
arena as Lightfoot's check did.
   Bergson said the city was honoring Lightfoot for his song ``The
Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.'' Residents of Superior died in
1975 on the ore carrying ship.
   The hockey association needs about $60,000 to put the finishing
touches on the arena, Bergson said.

   TOWN AND COUNTRY, Mo. (AP) - First lady Barbara Bush and her dog
Millie won't attend the opening of a new wing at the Dog Museum of
America, but Millie will be represented by a painting.
   Animal artist Christine Merrill has completed a painting
depicting the English springer spaniel in front of the White House,
museum president Dorothy Welsh said Wednesday.
   The painting, done from photographs, will be displayed at the
museum.
   Mrs. Bush got Millie three years ago after the death of the
family's longtime dog, C. Fred Bush. Millie's full name is Mildred
Kerr Bush.
   Millie became famous when she appeared on the cover of Life
magazine in 1989 after having puppies.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Actress Bo Derek and her producer-director
husband, John, stopped at the White House Thursday and got a tour
of the grounds from President Bush.
   The actress was in town for the Washington International Horse
Show, according to the White House press office. ``She called and
wanted to see the White House,'' said spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Bush had canceled campaign appearances in Arizona and New Mexico
because of the precarious state of negotiations as Congress and the
administration sought agreement on a $500-billion deficit-reduction
package. So the president had no scheduled activities on his public
agenda.
   Several young, male White House aides clustered in the hallways
with a gaggle of reporters and photographers to catch a glimpse of
the blond actress through the glass doors leading to the Rose
Garden.
   The president was seen escorting the couple along the driveway
near the Oval Office.

   SEATTLE (AP) - Nancy and Ann Wilson of the rock group Heart plan
a concert to raise money for environmental groups working to
preserve Puget Sound, an area they say is threatened by pollution
and other environmental hazards.
   The sisters, who grew up in the Seattle area, say they want the
proceeds from ``Puget Sound Live'' to benefit wildlife species
threatened by the area's booming population.
   ``Every day the Sound's marine life is threatened,'' Ann Wilson
said at a news conference Wednesday. ``Many wildlife species, from
eagles to the smallest creatures in our few remaining wetlands, are
forced to retreat or become extinct.''
   The concert, scheduled for Dec. 8 at the Seattle Center
Coliseum, is to benefit the Seattle Aquarium, the Nature
Conservancy, the Washington Environmental Council and the
Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Jeremy Miller of the television series ``Growing
Pains'' teamed up with muppets Bert and Ernie and other characters
from ``Sesame Street'' for three new episodes of a children's
televison series about Israel. ``Shalom Sesame'' is a joint project
of the Children's Television Workshop and Israel Education
Television. The shows are released for broadcast on U.S. public
television and sold as videotapes.
   The three new episodes - ``Chanukah,'' ``Sing Around the
Seasons,'' and ``Journey to Secret Places'' - will be added to a
library of five other ``Shalom Sesame'' programs.
   ``We wanted to present an everyday image of Israel - of kids,
families, customs, traditions and friendship,'' said executive
producer Lewis Bernstein. ``If Bert and Ernie can travel to Israel,
them maybe American kids will want to.''
   The ``Chanukah'' episode also features comedians Joan Rivers and
Alan King and actress Nell Carter.

<HEAD>Three Sergeants Fail to Make Weight Limit, Get Demoted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three recently promoted police sergeants
have lost their stripes because they failed to shed their flab, and
the Fraternal Order of Police is fighting mad.
   ``I've got 26 years on the job, and since I got out of the
academy nobody's checked my weight to see if I ate too many
doughnuts,'' FOP President John Shaw complained.
   Stephen Guckin, Joseph McGoldrick and John J. Harkins became
sergeants in April after passing oral and written tests. But they
also signed agreements with the city to meet weight limits.
   When the deadline came last week, they hadn't made their weight
objectives. They were demoted to the rank of officer.
   City officials said pay varies according to an individual's
merit raises and other factors, but that the demotions meant the
three men probably went from about $34,380 a year down to around
$31,500.
   The city was sympathetic but firm about standards that had been
loosely applied for years.
   ``Nobody wants to penalize people who are on a promotional
list,'' said Ralph J. Teti, the chief deputy city solicitor.
``They've shown they have some qualities of leadership. But you
don't want to do anything that's going to endanger them, either.''
   Some police who were ordered to get rid of the pounds succeeded.
A new lieutenant, two corporals and a detective met their goals.
Another detective told to lose 46 pounds got rid of only 35 but
kept his promotion because of the progress he had made.
   Guckin was told to lose 40 pounds and only lost 20; McGoldrick
was expected to lose 28 pounds and didn't lose any; and Harkins
promised to lose 100 pounds and only dropped two.
   Guckin said he had lost nearly 50 pounds before his promotion,
getting his weight down to 280 pounds. Although it was a struggle
to lose 20 more pounds since then, he said he hopes to lose 20
more.
   McGoldrick, 41, a nine-year veteran of the force, weighed 291
pounds last week. Harkins, 37, a 16-year veteran, weighed 313,
according to city officials.
   The Police Department doesn't require routine physical
examinations, but Teti said it eventually hopes to do so once or
twice a year.
   The weight standards have been in effect for at least 15 years,
Teti said, although police currently undergo medical tests only
when they are hired or promoted or when they return to duty after
long leaves.
   Teti said the city's weight standards are based on tables
developed by life insurance companies. Rookies have to be within 20
percent of their ideal weight; veterans must be within 30 percent.
   For example, the guidelines allow a 6-foot male veteran to weigh
up to 244 pounds and a 5-foot-6 female veteran to weigh 207 pounds.
   Shaw still thought the program was unrealistic.
   ``You can't walk over to a cop and say, `You're being promoted
to sergeant, and by the way, you have to loose 80 pounds.' I know
people do it on TV, but that doesn't make it right or good for your
health,'' he said Tuesday.
   Guckin, 31, said he was surprised to learn about the weight
requirement last spring.
   ``These promotions are not handed to you,'' he said. ``Ten years
ago they hired me at one weight. Now they expect me to be less than
that because I got promoted.''
   Teti said the Police Department agreed to put the three
policemen back at the top of its list for promotions and they will
have a shot at the next openings for sergeant.
   ``Provided they make the weight minimums,'' he said.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Scores Landslide Victory, Ms. Bhutto Says She'll
Challenge Vote</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos ISL1,2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A right-wing coalition scored a
landslide victory over ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Thursday and urged her to be a good loser and accept defeat. Ms.
Bhutto said she'll go to court.
   Ms. Bhutto, ejected from office Aug. 6 on corruption and
mismanagement charges, refused to concede Wednesday's parliamentary
election and accused the army-backed caretaker government of
massive vote-rigging.
   A group of 40 international poll watchers refused to comment on
the allegations, but was expected to discuss its preliminary
findings Friday in Karachi.
   The group's assessment could affect hundreds of millions of
dollars in U.S. aid to Pakistan. The United States and other
Western countries have threatened to cut off aid if the elections
were rigged.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States looks forward to working with any Pakistani
government ``elected in a free and fair election,'' but it was
reserving judgment on the results.
   Some poll watchers said privately they were suspicious of some
constituencies where they witnessed a low voter turnout yet the
final count showed tens of thousands had marked their ballot. But
they said large-scale vote fraud will be difficult to prove.
   ``I can assure you the election has not been rigged,'' caretaker
Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi told a news conference. ``The
people have given their mandate, their verdict. She should accept
the results and prove to the world that she's a democrat.''
   Ms. Bhutto said she would challenge the election results in
court rather than call street demonstrations.
   ``The People's Party candidates who lost because of rigged
election will challenge the results in court,'' Ms. Bhutto, 37,
said after returning to her hometown of Karachi on Thursday night.
   Most political analysts, foreign diplomats and opinion polls
predicted a close race between Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan
People's Party and the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance for
control of the 217-member National Assembly, the policy-making
lower house of Parliament that chooses the prime minister.
   But the final vote count, completed almost 24 hours after the
polls closed, showed Ms. Bhutto's opponents had delivered a
stunning upset that surpassed even their expectations.
   Ms. Bhutto's People's Party and its smaller allies won only 45
seats. The Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of
18 diverse parties united by their contempt for Ms. Bhutto, emerged
with 105 seats.
   Voting was delayed in one constituency because of a candidate's
death. The rest of the seats went to smaller ethnic and religious
partiies and independents.
   Most seemed at a loss to explain Ms. Bhutto's dismal showing.
Some blamed poor voter turnout, estimated at about 35 percent.
   ``There's a growing sense of apathy and cynicism about the whole
democratic process in Pakistan,'' one Western diplomat said on
condition of anonymity. ``After watching repeated governments swept
aside either by the military or by the constitution, people are
beginning to ask why bother to vote.''
   Pakistan has been ruled by four military dictators since its
creation as a Moslem homeland in the 1947 partition that ended
British colonial rule of the subcontinent.
   Ms. Bhutto alleged she lost because of rigging in at least 80
constituencies. She accused the caretaker government of stuffing
and stealing ballot boxes and intimidating and harrassing voters to
keep them away from polling booths.
   Jatoi replied: ``The country cannot depend on the whims and
fantasies of a young lady, as attractive as she may be, especially
with the foreign press. The country has to move forward.''
   The winning alliance's first test will come Saturday when voters
return to the polls to elect legislative assemblies in Pakistan's
four provinces. Ms. Bhutto has said her party will contest the
elections.
   The alliance's victory likely puts Pakistan on a more
conservative, Islamic course.
   The alliance espouses adherence to the tents of Islam, prompting
speculation it could tigthen control on the media and restrict the
rights of women and non-Moslems. It also favors a closer
relationship with the Islamic world and more independence from the
West, especially the United States.
   According to Pakistan's constitution, power must be transferred
from the caretaker government to the new government within 30 days.
The next prime minister will be elected by secret ballot when the
National Assembly is called to session.
   Party sources say Pakistan's next premier would likely be Nawaz
Sharif, the alliance leader and former chief minister of eastern
Punjab province, where 60 percent of Pakistan's 110 million people
live.
   Alliance leaders have said the new government will continue the
caretaker government's investigation of corruption by Ms. Bhutto's
government.
   The caretaker government has charged Ms. Bhutto with seven
counts of abuse of power and had her husband jailed on charges of
kidnapping and extortion. She says the charges are baseless.

<HEAD>Man IRA Strapped Into Bomb-Laden Van Lives to Tell the Tale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic man said
Thursday that he thought he was driving to his death when IRA
gunmen strapped him into a van loaded with explosives and tailed
him to a military base.
   ``This is it,'' he recalled thinking.
   But Gerry Kelly was lucky: He wriggled free and the bomb failed
to go off.
   Similar bomb-laden vehicles, which the Irish Republican Army
forced two other men to drive, exploded early Wednesday at two army
border checkpoints in Londonderry and Newry, killing six soldiers
and one of the drivers.
   It was the deadliest IRA onslaught in the province in two years.
   The IRA said the drivers were ``collaborators'' who had done
construction work for the security forces.
   Kelly said IRA gunmen came to his house, held his family
hostage, took his van and filled it with explosives. They then
strapped him in the seat and ordered him to drive to the Sherwood
Foresters base at Lisanelly near Omagh 55 miles west of Belfast,
where he is a mechanic, Kelly said.
   He said one of the men told him, ``I'm putting a 40-minute timer
on, so you've got plenty of time.'''
   ``They said, `Don't do anything stupid. We have a rifle trained
on you.'''
   ``It was a terrible ordeal,'' Kelly said. ``I just kept thinking
about my family and what would happen to them. The sweat was
dribbling down my face. All sorts of things were going through my
mind and I thought this was it.''
   As he drove through the gates, he said, ``I shouted, `Bombs! I
got myself out of the rope.''
   ``They told me that the rope was there to make sure I didn't
jump out and that when I arrived at the camp the Brits would loosen
it and let me out.
   ``I was tied round my waist. I didn't really know why they did
it, but I was absolutely terrified.''
   Dozens of local residents, some in tears, laid flowers Thursday
in the debris of an army checkpoint outside Londonderry, Northern
Ireland's second city 65 miles northwest of Belfast.
   Five soldiers and driver Patsy Gillespie were killed when his
car carrying a 1,000-pound bomb destroyed the Buncara checkpoint.
   While the residents, some whose houses were damaged in the bomb
blast, appealed for an end to violence, the body of another victim
of Northern Ireland's political and sectarian violence -
28-year-old Protestant William Skey - was found in Belfast.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary
group, said they killed William Skey, who had been questioned
Wednesday by police about terrorist activities. They accused Skey
of passing information about ``prominent loyalists'' to police and
Catholic paramilitary groups.
   ``I just want them to know that we're not all murdering rats,''
said Pat Wylie, 51, who led about 70 local people in laying wreaths
at the Buncara checkpoint. ``There are good people here, too. We do
live in fear. But somebody has got to make a stand.''
   Mrs. Wylie, a grandmother of seven, was crying as she spoke out
against the IRA. She demanded to know why Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher didn't call in the army's elite SAS regiment ``and clear
them out once and for all.''
   Police in the Republic of Ireland said six of eight men arrested
just south of the border two hours after Wednesday's IRA bombings
would appear in a special criminal court in Dublin Thursday night
on unspecified charges.
   A spokesman for the Garda, or police, said on condition of
anonymity the men were questioned about a series of offenses,
including the IRA bombings. But the charge was not related to the
checkpoint bombings.
   In the attack on an army checkpoint near Newry 35 miles south of
Belfast, one soldier die. The man who drove the bomb-laden van
while the IRA held his relatives captive managed to escape from the
vehicle after shouting a warning before the explosion.
   Hospitals reported 35 other people were injured in the attacks
near Londonderry and Newry on the border with the Republic of
Ireland.
   The IRA has targeted the security forces in its fight to end
British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant
province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Airport Security Not Told of Bomb Threat, Inquiry Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Heathrow Airport security officer
said Thursday he received no warning about a bomb threat to Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988,
killing 270 people.
   There were no instructions to be on the lookout for a Toshiba
radio cassette recorder among passengers' baggage, Sulkash Kumar
Kamboj told a public inquiry into the terrorist bombing. The bomb
that blew up the plane was inside a Toshiba cassette recorder,
packed in a suitcase.
   Kamboj said security staff were told to always check carefully
any items of electrical equipment among the luggage. But he said
his employers, Alert Security, had given him no specific warning to
look out for the Toshiba machine.
   He said he knew nothing about the so-called ``Helsinki warning''
of a bomb threat to a Pan Am flight. The U.S. Embassy in Helsinki,
Finland received a telephone warning that there would be a bombing
attack on a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to New York around
Christmas, but the warning was not made public.
   Pan American World Airways Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt on
a Boeing 727, but switched to a larger Boeing 747 at Heathrow for
the flight to New York.
   Kamboj said he was working a 12-hour day on Dec. 21, 1988. He
checked passengers' luggage being transferred to Pan Am jets from
feeder flights at Heathrow's Terminal 3.
   All bags transferred from other airlines' flights to Pan Am
Flight 103 passed through an X-ray machine, and he paid particular
attention to any electrical items. But the outline of a
radio-cassette player did not cause special concern among so many
electrical items, Kamboj said.
   The inquiry heard earlier this week that baggage transferred
from Pan Am flights, including luggage from Frankfurt, was not
screened before being loaded onto the plane. Scottish police have
said they believe the bag with the cassette recorder bomb inside
was put on the plane in Frankfurt.
   Kamboj said ``no one can recognize every single thing in the
bags. It is impossible to be right 100 percent of the time.''
   He said he received one day of training when he joined Alert
Security 3{ years ago. The training has been increased to an
eight-day course since the disaster, the inquiry was told.
   There also have been changes to the security system, including
the introduction of a color X-ray monitor.
   The public inquiry is focusing on the deaths of the 259 people
aboard the plane and 11 on the ground, and how to prevent a
repetition of the disaster, but is not considering criminal
responsibility.
   Scottish authorities have said they are investigating several
radical Palestinian groups.

   For seasoned lawmakers, Congress' final rush
to adjournment is a window of opportunity for their legislative
priorities.
   ``There are some members of both the House and Senate who
operate best at midnight when they can do their legislative
slam-dunks with the public looking the other way,'' said Rep. Pat
Williams, D-Mont.
   For Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, it's a chance to win some
long-sought incentives for oil exploration. Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., quietly won Senate approval of an amendment restricting
grants by the National Endowment for the Arts.
   Others insert provisions into bills for new projects back home.
There won't be time enough for opponents to quibble, but enough
time to brag just before the election.
   But not everyone gets to cash in. For some, the end game is a
time of pain when the rank-and-file lawmaker gets run over.
   ``Even as somebody is amputating our legs, they're also pulling
out our fingernails,'' said Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo. ``The longer
we're up here, the more we're going to get rolled.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., described it as a
``natural tendency to negotiate ... up to the point of the absolute
running out of time.''
   But Congress is running out of time this year lke never before,
staying in session with less than two weeks before the election.
   It happens every Congress: Bills that have been stacking up for
two years suddenly must get passed NOW or die.
   An amazing number - dozens and dozens - rocket through the House
and the Senate in the final days. On Thursday, the House approved a
$268 billion Pentagon spending compromise in 11 minutes.
   Congress' closing agenda this year includes everything from fish
inspection to clean air, from raising taxes to declaring Statue of
Liberty Day.
   Some, such as clean air, remain individual bills, but others,
such as child care, get amalgamated into huge legislative packages.
Both are examples of brinksmanship.
   The child-care bill, a long-argued piece of legislation, was
practically given up for dead - until the end game gave it new
life.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., its prime Senate sponsor, said
he had only intended a bluff when he threatened to offer his
version as an amendment to the already huge budget bill that's been
crawling through Congress.
   Suddenly, with the elections around the corner, the White House
wanted to negotiate.
   ``All I know is that Friday evening, for the first time in four
years, we had an offer to sit down and talk,'' Dodd said.
   A deal was reached in three days, and the package is expected to
pass along with the budget.
   The clean air bill, the first major revision of the air
pollution law since the 1970s, was one of the goals the Democratic
leadership and President Bush listed when the 101st Congress began
in January 1989.
   But the legislation moved from one gridlock to another until
finally, with time running out, a compromise was forced.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Thursday he expected
final House and Senate action before adjournment.
   Some members doubt that the final rush produces good
legislation.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is a regular participant in the end
game because, as a champion of the big Medicare and Medicaid health
programs, he inevitably becomes entwined in last-minute
budget-cutting talks.
   ``We're always dragged in. The politics of the budget is driving
health care policy,'' he said. ``It's not a rational way to make
decisions.''

<HEAD>Scandinavians Concerned Over Soviet Arctic Nuclear Test</HEAD>

   Scandinavians chained themselves to
Soviet border posts and Nordic politicians expressed surprise
Thursday over a Soviet nuclear test on the arctic islands of Novaya
Zemlya.
   A last-minute appeal to Moscow by Prime Minister Jan P. Syse of
Norway failed to halt the test, and Finnish officials ordered an
investigation into the effects of the blast, about 370 miles from
the Norwegian border.
   The Soviet nuclear explosion Wednesday afternoon came only days
after Soviet officials denied such tests would be carried out.
   The Soviet Embassy informed Norwegian officials earlier
Wednesday about a test ``in the immediate future,'' according to
Syse's office in Oslo. The Soviets had invited Norwegian government
environmentalists to check the test site earlier in the week.
   ``We strongly disapprove of what the neighboring state now has
done,'' Syse told the national news agency, NTB.
   Protesters chained themselves to a Norwegian boom at a border
post to the Soviet Union and chanted ``Novoya Semlya, Nyet!'' as a
Soviet delegation crossed to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the
area's liberation from Nazi occupation.
   A former Norwegian prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, who
heads the United Nations Commission on the Environment and
Development, condemned the test.
   ``The Soviet test blast spreads negative reaction and fear -
especially in north Norway,'' Brundtland said.
   However, both Finnish and Norwegian nuclear experts said there
was little to fear from the tests. They said no increased radiation
had been detected in northern Scandinavia.
   The Finnish Foreign Ministry said the Nordic countries will
jointly demand an end to all global undergound nuclear tests.
   The Finnish environment minister, Kaj Barlund, said he would
discuss the issue with his Soviet counterpart, Nikolai Voronchov,
at a meeting of environment ministers in Helsinki next week.
   ``The test came as a complete surprise to us. I am extremely
concerned about it and will demand more information from my Soviet
colleague,'' Barlund said in a telephone interview.
   Barlund said a fact-finding committee had been ordered to study
the possible danger of the explosion to Finland and would try to
visit the Soviet test site in the Barents Sea.
   ``We don't know whether this is a one-off test or the beginning
of a series. But in any case, such tests are very harmful to the
extremely vulnerable arctic environment,'' Barlund said.
   In a live broadcast on national Finnish radio on Saturday,
Soviet officials had denied the Soviet Union planned tests on the
islands.
   ``These days we are not conducting underground explosions on
Novaya Zemlya ... And such explosions will not be continued by the
USSR,'' Andrei Salatkyov, a Soviet parliamentiarian, said in the
broadcast.
   The Swedish government expressed regret over the resumption of
Soviet nuclear testing in the arctic.
   ``This awakes a deep and justified concern in Sweden and many
other countries,'' said Sweden's Foreign Minister, Sten Andersson.
He said Soviet embassy officials had been summoned to the Foreign
Ministry to be told of his government's concern.
   Earlier this year, the Nordic countries jointly appealed to the
Soviet Union not to resume nuclear testing on Novaya Zemlya after a
two-year interruption.
   The environmental groups Greenpeace and Bellona have warned that
the Soviets planned to resume nuclear testing on the islands and
sent two ships there earlier this month and in September. Both were
intercepted by the Soviet coast guard.
   The islands were a primary Soviet nuclear test site from
1958-1963.

   Riot police fired tear gas Thursday to
break up student demonstrations against plans to bring the
University of Zimbabwe under tighter government control. At least a
dozen students were arrested.
   Hundreds of students demonstrated outside the Parliament
building in downtown Harare to protest the measure, which would
give the higher education minister a say in the university's
administration.
   It would also reduce the protection granted to staff and
students facing disciplinary action by the university.
   ``The government is becoming our headmaster,'' one student
demonstrator complained.
   In the protest downtown, riot police wielding batons and shields
dispersed the students and confiscated anti-government placards.
Earlier Thursday, riot police fired tear gas at students
demonstrating for two hours in the middle of a major road to the
capital.
   Students waved placards and shouted slogans for two hours before
being forced back to the campus by police. Once on campus, some
students hurled bricks at the university administration building
and set fire to overturned garbage bins.
   Riot police do not have the authority to follow the students
back onto campus.
   Under emergency regulations last October, the government closed
down the university for six months following violent protests. More
than 480 students in that protest were arrested then.
   Zimbabwe's 25-year state of emergency was lifted in July.

   A woman passenger has been reported missing from a

island of St. Helena, a shipping spokesman said Thursday.
   Ruth Whitehead, 63, a German national who lives in South Africa,
was presumed to have fallen overboard from the passenger ship St.
Helena Island, according to Michael Howorth of the St. Helena

   ``The St. Helena Island is retracing its steps in an effort to

Rowanbank, had joined the search, he said.
   Howorth said the St. Helena Island left Cape Town Oct. 3
carrying 43 passengers. It was due Nov. 3 in Cardiff, Wales.
   Howorth said Mrs. Whitehead was traveling with her husband,
Frederick, 68.

   Township residents angry at local
officials clashed with police Thursday after an explosion and fire
heavily damaged the local government building. At least five people
were killed.
   At least 12 people were injured, including two police officers,
in the violence in the Khayelitsha black township, about 25 miles
east of Cape Town.
   Many residents of black townships oppose the local councils and
consider council members collaborators with the white-led South
African government.
   Tension has been high in Khayelitsha since last week's slaying
of Momsa Mapongwana, the wife of an anti-apartheid leader in the
township.
   According to a police statement, violence broke out shortly
before midnight Wednesday in Khayelitsha when an explosion started
a fire at the town council building. Police said the blast could
have been caused by a limpet mine.
   Firefighters extinguished the blaze, but police said township
residents then began hurling stones at police officers, who fired
back with tear gas, rubber bullets and birdshot to stop at least
800 people from marching to the council offices.
   After the crowd was disbanded, one policeman with a shotgun
ordered photographers to stop making pictures of a body on the
ground. The policemen then taunted the journalists, shouting
several times: ``Take my picture if you dare.''
   Witnesses said at least two people died in the crash. Police
attributed only one of the deaths to the clash early Thursday,
police said, saying two others were under investigation.
   Two more residents were shot to death by police Thursday evening
when they attacked the house of a constable, police said.
   At least 10 residents and two policemen were injured in the
unrest Thursday, authorities said.
   They said police declared the march illegal and gave people a
minute to disperse. Some marchers began walking toward police with
their hands up, making peace symbols with their fingers, and police
began shooting, the witnesses alleged.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, returning
home from a regional tour, said Arab leaders want to avoid war, but
do not want to give in to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   The state-run Middle East News Agency quoted Mubarak as saying
there was no erosion in determination to confront Saddam, who took
over Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In official statements distributed in Oman, the last leg of the
trip, Mubarak was quoted as saying: ``No one wants war, but at the
same time legitimacy must be established and the law of the jungle
must not prevail.''
   Journalists accompanying the Egyptian leader quoted him as
saying that the chances of a war in the Persian Gulf were
``fifty-fifty.''
   The Egyptian president visited Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar and Oman.
   The state news agency quoted Mubarak as declaring his talks
``showed the desire of their leaders to end the problem of the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait by reaching a settlement that spares the
region war, but without any compromise on the necessity of an Irll tax.
Government employees in Illinois and
several other states are now exempt from that levy.
   ``I want to vote for it, but that's the killer for me,'' he
said.
   For Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., the problem was the limit the
plan would put on tax deductions for people earning more than
$100,000 annually.
   ``This is a back-door way of raising taxes on two-income
families,'' she said.
   But House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., was counting on
about 50 House Republican votes for the package. That meant for
passage, majority Democrats would have to produce about 170 votes
out of their 258 members - a figure leaders said they would reach.

<HEAD>EC Grants $34 Million in Heating Fuel, Aid for Romanian Orphans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EC Commission on Thursday granted
$34.4 million in emergency relief aid for 130,000 orphans in
Romania.
   The aid will be used to pay for heating fuel at many orphanages,
as well as to provide medicine, infant food and spare parts to fix
some orphanages' out-of-order heating systems, the Commission said
in a statement.
   The EC also said it will send an engineer to Romania this week
to assess the need for heating equipment that cannot be bought
locally.
   The funds announced Thursday are in addition to $3.6 million the
EC granted to non-government agencies recently to help care for the
Romanian orphans, many of whom are suffering from AIDS through use
of infected needles. Needles have been in chronic short supply in
Romania, hence some needles were overused.
   The plight of orphans in Romania is a legacy of the regime of
Nicolae Ceauscescu, the former dictator who was executed last
December.
   The Commission said it planned another grant of almost $9
million ``for additional supplies of infant foods'' at the request
of Romania's ministry of health.
   EC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen, in a letter
to Romanian Prime Minister Petre Roman, said the aid granted
Thursday ``represents the most effective practical solution'' to
the immediate heating problem at many orphanages.
   In Luxembourg last Monday, the EC and Romania signed a five-year
trade and economic cooperation agreement. On that occasion, Roman
told Andriessen that the Romanian armed forces had been mobilized
to help repair heating systems in buildings used as orphanages.

   The U.S. rift with Israel over Jerusalem tests
the Bush administration's skill in shielding its Middle Eastern
ally from tougher measures in the United Nations and in keeping
flickering hopes for peace talks alive.
   U.S. officials said Thursday they had no intention of seeking
new resolutions in the Security Council attacking Israel. Their
hope is the furor over Israel's refusal to cooperate with an
investigation into the slaying of 19 Palestinian Arabs will subside
in a few days.
   But Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said unless Israel
changed its mind his report would deal with ways of protecting
Palestinians. And British Ambassador David Hannay, who is presiding
over the Council this month, said Israel's treatment of
Palestinians ``is not going to go away from the council agenda.
...''
   That portends a U.N. foot in the door that Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir feared and prompted the Israeli Cabinet to
refuse to cooperate with the U.N. investigation.
   The U.S. vote to deplore Israel's decision, along with a U.S.
vote two weeks ago to condemn Israel for the shootings, shatters
the assumption the United States nearly always stands by its friend
in the usually hostile United Nations.
   This could whet the appetite of Israel's enemies to keep up the
pressure while diverting the Bush administration from its goal of
refocusing attention on Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   ``The United States and Israel used to agree that the U.N. was a
hostile place. That is no longer the case as a result of the end of
the Cold War and now the Iraqi aggression,'' said Martin Indyk,
director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ``The
United States has increasingly turned to the U.N. as the mechanism
for promoting a new world order while for Israel it remains a very
hostile place.''
   Moreover, Indyk said Thursday that ``the United States ... will
constantly have to decide with every new resolution whether it's
going to isolate itself or condemn Israel again. This hastens the
day when either there will be sanctions against Israel or the
United States will have to use its veto. So it's a no-win situation
for the United States.''
   In fact, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister
Shamir, said Thursday that the unanimous resolution ``helps Saddam
Hussenn to distract attention from what is happening in the Gulf.''
   But Richard W. Murphy, a former assistant secretary of state for
the Near East, faults Israel for mishandling the dispute ``at a
hell of an unfortunate time'' and sees at least one boost for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   ``He's able to say, ``See, that's exactly what I've been saying
all along. Follow me and we'll do something about the Palestinian
issue,'' Murphy, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, said Thursday.
   William B. Quandt, who ran the Middle East desk at the National
Security Council for then-President Carter, says it will be
difficult for the Bush administration to get the focus back on Iraq
at the United Nations.
   ``There are pressures in the U.N. largely from the Arab group
and also the Third World to bargain over U.N. resolutions,'' to try
to trade support for U.S. resolutions on the Persian Gulf for U.S.
support on Arab-Israeli issues, Quandt said Thursday.
   And yet, for the foreseeable future, the gulf is so much the
dominant issue that ``there is no desire to dwell on this
difference - and it's real - with Israel,'' said Quandt, who is a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
   Conveniently, perhaps, next month is the United States' turn to
preside over the Security Council. This could facilitate action on
a series of resolutions against Iraq, including a proposal by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that Saddam Hussein be forced
to pay reparations for the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Israeli Cabinet's decision, and Shamir's refusal to reverse
it, is the latest in a string of disagreements with the Bush
administration.
   The president has referred to East Jerusalem as occupied
territory, thereby suggesting he considers Israel's control over
part of its capital illegitimate.
   Israel's settlement of some Soviet Jewish refugees in East
Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza is another sore point.
   The Bush administration considers settlements of Soviet refugees
or any other Jews in the territories an obstacle to peace because
the Arabs hope to recapture the lands they lost in the 1967 Mideast
war.
   Like its predecessors, the administration also is committed to
urging Israel to give up most if not all of the territory in
exchange for Arab acceptance of the Jewish state.
   David Scheffer, an international lawyer who is with the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, says Israel could have admitted
the U.N. investigators without conceding its claim of sovereignty
over east Jerusalem.
   ``I do not consider it to be giving the U.N. some extraordinary
foothold in Jerusalem,'' he said. ``There are U.N. observers in
Jerusalem. The U.N. is already there.''
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III - and others in
the administration who would like to see Israel negotiate with
Palestinians Arabs - will try to repair the rift before it destroys
any chance for getting Israeli-Palestinian talks started.
   But Israel, which has depended on U.S. support in a world
organization largely hostile to the Jewish state, is bound to feel
even more anxious about risking negotiations with only the Bush
administration for protection.
   ``Does it leave scars?,'' ex-diplomat Murphy said of the two
U.S. votes against Israel. ``Probably yes. Both sides think the
other is unreasonable.''
   But asked if the rift derails Mideast peace talks, Murphy
replied: ``You don't derail something that isn't on the tracks yet.
in fact, the tracks aren't there yet.''

   Barring the outbreak of war in the Persian
Gulf, gasoline prices will hover between $1.30 and $1.62 per gallon
over the next year, an administration energy expert told a Senate
panel Thursday.
   The forecast came in the opening session of a three-day hearing
on why oil prices shoot up on the slightest rumor of trouble in the
Mideast but don't seem to come down on rumors of peace.
   U.S. Energy Information Administrator Calvin Kent also predicted
that home heating oil would cost between $1.13 and $1.45 per gallon
through 1991, roughly equal to the high levels heating oil reached
in last winter's cold snap.
   An improvement in the Mideast situation might lower the price of
crude oil. But don't look for an immediate response at the pump,
Kent told the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.
   ``Prices go up more quickly than they come down,'' Kent said.
   The price estimates assume that the Persian Gulf crisis does not
dissolve into war, that the winter is normal in severity and that
market factors such as inventories and daily oil production remain
relatively stable.
   Also assumed in Kent's forecast was that crude oil remains at
about $30 per barrel. That assumption seemed open to question even
as he testified; in New York's mercantile exchange oil jumped $3.17
per barrel in early trading to $34.25 by mid day.
   Members of the Senate panel focused on the volatility of the oil
market. Committee Chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, scoffed at how
``some goofy thing,'' like a rumor about Saddam Hussein having a
dream can affect oil prices.
   The reference was to a report in an Iraqi newspaper that Hussein
had a dream that his guns were aimed at the wrong enemy. Even the
mere suggestion that tensions with the United States might be
reduced was enough to cause crude oil prices to drop.
   In the past few days, though, crude prices have increased as
hopes for a compromise to end the Gulf standoff waned. The reason
for price volatility, Kent said, is that other Mideast countries
like Saudi Arabia are pumping out extra oil to make up for the loss
of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil. Further trouble in the Mideast could
interrupt that flow.
   ``The vast amount of replacement oil is coming from the Gulf and
the vast majority of that is coming from Saudi Arabia,'' Kent said.
``Rumors of war make the market extremely nervous and that's why
you see these jumps of $2 and $3 in the price based on fairly
trivial rumors.''
   American Petroleum Institute President Charles DiBona told the
committee that oil industries have shown ``considerable restraint''
in holding back on price increases at the pump. Between Aug. 2 and
the end of September, he said, the spot price on crude oil rose 44
cents per gallon while gasoline went up at the pump by only 24
cents.
   Department of Energy statistics submitted to the committee
indicate that heating oil customers have felt the gulf crisis more
directly. Oil companies have passed on 90 percent of the crude
price increase to consumers of home heating oil.

   A jury Thursday convicted a state lawmaker
of selling his vote for pari-mutuel betting for $4,300, ending the
first trial stemming from an FBI undercover sting labeled
``Operation Lost Trust.''
   The sting so far has resulted in indictments charging 10
legislators with bribery. Four have resigned their seats and
pleaded guilty. One of the 10 lawmakers pleaded guilty to drug
charges earlier this month, as did a lobbyist.
   The U.S. District Court jury convicted State Rep. Luther Taylor,
a 40-year-old Democrat from Columbia, on all six counts against him
of violating the Hobbs Act, a federal anti-bribery law. An
indictment accused him of accepting five separate bribes and with
conspiring to solicit those bribes in exchange for his support of a
pari-mutuel betting bill.
   Taylor voted for the bill in committee during this past
legislative session. The bill never made it to the state House or
Senate.
   The conviction carries a maximum penalty of 120 years in prison
and a $1.5 million fine. No sentencing date was set.
   The jury reached its verdict after about six hours of
deliberation that followed a 10-day trial.
   Videotapes and lobbyist Ron Cobb dominated the prosecution's
case. Cobb, a former Democratic House member who had become a
lobbyist, testified that he worked undercover for the FBI after
getting caught trying to buy cocaine from federal agents.
   Cobb testified he had bribed Taylor with $2,500 to help recruit
other lawmakers to support the pari-mutuel measure, which would
have allowed voters to decide whether to allow betting on horse and
dog racing in South Carolina.
   Videotapes showed Cobb giving an appreciative Taylor the cash.
   Taylor maintained throughout his testimony that Cobb was giving
him campaign contributions.
   But under cross-examination, Taylor admitted that during a
January meeting he slipped Cobb a note saying: ``for my undivided
attention, $2,500.''
   Cobb has been granted immunity. Another lobbyist, James Brown,
pleaded guilty to marijuana possession this month in a separate
case stemming from Operation Lost Trust.
   During closing arguments Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dale
DuTremble reminded jurors of the potential impact of their decision
at the Statehouse and around South Carolina. He said a guilty
verdict would deter corruption.
   ``How long can you allow people like Luther Taylor to sell out?
How long can you allow South Carolina to be disgraced? You're
entitled to better,'' DuTremble said. ``It's time for you to send a
message to the Luther Taylors of our General Assembly.''
   ``His office of public trust was for sale,'' DuTremble said.
   Defense attorney Joel Collins attacked the credibility of
government witnesses, especially Cobb.
   ``That ought to bother you that they ought to choose this kind
of guy,'' Collins said.
   Collins argued four separate defenses to the jury: that Taylor
had no intent to break the law; that he made a ``good faith''
effort to obey the law; that he did not violate the federal
anti-bribery law because he consistently supported the pari-mutuel
measure; and that his actions could have no effect on interstate
commerce, a required element for a conviction under the law Taylor
was accused of violating.
   Each one of those defenses should cause the jury to have a
``reasonable doubt'' that Taylor committed the crimes, Collins
said.
   He said jurors didn't need to convict Taylor in order to send a
message to the Statehouse.
   If the jury brought back an innocent verdict, ``The message
wouldn't be `we tolerate sleazy legislators.' The message would be
`Don't bring dope dealers in here and expect us to believe them
beyond a reasonable doubt.' ''
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel got the last word in the prosecution's
rebuttal.
   He reminded the jury that Taylor admitted having more
``enthusiasm'' for the pari-mutuel betting bill after he got $2,500
from Cobb.
   ``Can you imagine a public official testifying on the stand that
he could be `more enthusiastic' for $2,500? Or $500? Or $300?,''
Daniel asked.

   The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with an August
decision that allows Harold Washington Party candidates for some
Cook County offices to be placed on the November ballot.
   Harold Washington Party official R. Eugene Pincham hailed the
order as ``a complete victory for us, a complete victory for the

   The Harold Washington Party on Oct. 12 was knocked off the
ballot by the Illinois Supreme Court.
   The Illinois court split 4-3 along partisan lines in upholding a
Cook County circuit court's decision that the party had filed
insufficient suburban nominating petitions.
   On Aug. 29, the Cook County Electoral Board voted 2-1 to allow
Harold Washington Party candidates for countywide executive offices
and for 10 Chicago-only county commissioners seats onto the ballot.
   Cook County Clerk Stanley Kusper said the order would allow

the travels of his Democratic opponent is really flying high.
   It's also zooming through a campaign commercial in Michigan.
   Mosbacher uses a film clip of the red-and-white private plane to

Bullock, the ad contends, even was flown ``north to Alaska.''
   In Michigan, the GOP challenger for governor has aired a

   In both ads, the plane bears tail number N62870 and soars over

   ``Our point is just how much Rob Mosbacher is a creation of Mike

   If Dan Coats is still a senator in 2004, he

   Coats, appointed U.S. senator in December 1988, is pledging he

   ``I think it is appropriate that someone who believes term
limitation is best for the system really ought to practice what he
preaches,'' Coats said.
   A bill Coats introduced as a House member nearly 10 years ago
would have limited congressmen to 12 years in the House and 12 in

   That bill failed.

<TEXT>
   Did President Bush squander a rare 80 percent
approval rating in a series of missteps and errors on taxes and the
budget?
   Critics suggest he did. But you wouldn't know it from listening
to White House officials. They say the president is bruised but
undaunted, and knew all along his ratings in the polls would
plunge.
   Before the ink was even applied to the new budget agreement, the
White House was trying Thursday to mend fences and salvage what it
could of Bush's sagging popularity.
   ``Speaking for myself, I want to see this budget matter behind
us,'' Bush said at a hastily assembled group photograph in the Rose
Garden orchestrated to telegraph a GOP unity that in reality
doesn't exist.
   Tired of fighting with other Republicans, the president is
prepared to hit the campaign trail again to beat up on Democrats.
   That was the strategy the White House was trying to sell
Thursday as Bush prepared to leave town for a four-day trip to
speak for Republican candidates. Forget about the budget, focus on
other areas where Republicans don't agree with Democrats, the
message went out.
   And the charge was led by Bush himself.
   ``We've been bludgeoned by a bunch of demagogic attacks by the
Democrats for months and I've been relatively sanguine in the face
of that because we've been trying to get something done,'' Bush
said at the Rose Garden event.
   ``But as soon as we get this done, finished, I will then be free
- as will everybody here that's been working on this - to have our
say,'' Bush declared.
   But the picture of GOP unity that the White House carefully
sought to paint didn't take long to smear.
   By the time Rep. Newt Gingrich walked the 100 yards from the
Rose Garden to the battery of microphones in the White House
driveway, he was again airing his differences with the president on
the budget.
   Gingrich, who opposed the first budget agreement signed off on
by the president, grumbled that the deal still had not been made
final.
   ``Since the plan doesn't exist ... I don't think any of us have
an obligation to tell you in advance what we would do'' in terms of
supporting it, Gingrich said.
   Bush, who earlier this year had one of the highest approval
ratings ever in public opinion polls, saw his acceptance go into a
near free-fall over what many critics see as a series of
miscalculations and mixed signals on the budget.
   And, in the end, Bush ended up backing a package that included
more than $150 billion in new taxes over five years - a far cry
from the ``no new taxes'' pledge of his 1988 campaign.
   Still, a senior administration official who briefed a group of
reporters at the White House on the condition of anonymity, said
that Bush ``went into this knowing full well and good he was
spending political capital.''
   ``None of what has happened is a complete surprise. The details
of who did what to whom were not predictable. But the fact that
there would be this kind of a rocky road was certainly well
anticipated,'' the official said.
   ``When he started this six months ago, talked to economists
about how important it was to get a package like this, we talked at
length about how he was going to have to invest his political
capital,'' the official continued.
   ``He knew there would be a big political hit and a big personal
hit on him. He could have drawn half of the (political) cartoons
himself. There's no naivete in all of that. But that's the thing he
felt he had to.''
   Furthermore, the official claimed, Bush's approval ratings in
the latest polls - hovering around 55 percent - may be way down
from 80 percent but ``he is probably in a better position going
into a midterm election'' than most previous presidents.
   ``With all the erosion of support his numbers are still probably
fine and he's going to use that to his benefit,'' the official
said.
   One additional sign of White House determination to cut its
losses and to move ahead with an increased election-year attack on
Democrats: its public denunciation Thursday of Ed Rollins, the
director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
   Rollins had suggested in a memo to GOP House members that it was
OK for them to repudiate Bush's positions if it helped them get
elected.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater all but invited Rollins
to resign - or be disciplined by the congressional committee.

<TEXT>
   Mash-Hoor, a bearded Druse Moslem
militiaman, greased his AK-47 and wrapped it tightly in a plastic
bag to bury it - just in case. Thousands of gunmen like him are
doing the same.
   After countless bloody battles in the course of Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war, the three main Moslem and Christian militias
agreed Thursday to withdraw from Beirut and its environs. But it is
an uneasy peace.
   ``This rifle is mine,'' Mash-Hoor said. ``I won it in a battle
in 1984. Who knows when I or someone dear to me will need it?''
   Approval of the withdrawal plan came from Samir Geagea's
right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia, Nabih Berri's
moderate Shiite Amal militia and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   But Hezbollah, or Party of God, held off on promising a pullout.
The Shiite group is believed be an umbrella for underground
extremists holding most of 13 missing Westerners in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, with some 3,500 main-force fighters, has long feuded
with the more secular Amal for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the country's biggest sect.
   The groundwork was laid for the militia withdrawal when
President Elias Hrawi's Syrian backers crushed a mutiny by rebel
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun Oct. 13 in fighting that killed up to
750 people in eight hours.
   The ultimate objective is to be disarm the militias and absorb
some of their fighters into government security forces. But
hardened gunslingers like Mash-Hoor - a nom de guerre meaning
``Famous'' - don't believe it will happen.
   ``No one believes they'll be disbanded. It never worked before.
It won't work now,'' Mash-Hoor said.
   There are about 20,000 fighters in the dozen or so militias.
Many have their own personal arsenals of automatic weapons, grenade
launchers, explosives and hand grenades.
   During past disarmament bids, fighters handed over some weapons,
but hid most of their arms - including tanks, artillery and
mortars.
   Many of the fighters, like Mash-Hoor, have known nothing but
violence. They are school dropouts, with no skills. Serving in the
militia is a meal ticket - the fighters simply take what they want
at restaurants, bars and gas stations.
   Mash-Hoor has been a member of the Druse Progressive Socialist
Party militia since he was seven years old. The civil war is all
he's ever known.
   He was born Marwan Yahya, and grew up in Druse town of Shweifat,
in the Chouf foothills. When the war broke out in 1975, he was only
a child. But he quit school to join the fighters.
   His first job in the militia was collecting empty cartridge
cases to be refilled. He was dubbed Abu Khartoush - Father of the
Bullets.
   He attended school ``on and off'' during lulls in the fighting,
but he found he no longer fit in.
   ``I was no longer willing to listen to teachers, do homework and
be disciplined,'' he said. ``I was Abu Khartoush.''
   At 12, he was renamed Abu Tabikh, or Father of Food, because ``I
was driving a Land Rover and distributing food to fighters on the
front lines.''
   In 1983, he proved himself as a fighter, battling Christians in
the Chouf Mountains, earning his fighting name. Warfare has been
his trade ever since.
   Unlike Mash-Hoor, Haidar, a 37-year-old Amal militiaman, can now
earn a living from his peacetime profession. Before he took up the
gun, he was a house painter.
   ``There'll be lots of painting work to do in greater Beirut,''
he said, in an understated reference to the war-wrecked capital.
   Haidar echoes Mash-Hoor in his skepticism that the militia will
truly lay down arms.
   He said Amal will withdraw from the south Beirut slum of Shiyah
which it controls. But, he said: ``I have no orders from my
superiors that the militia will be disbanded.''
   Haidar said he'll stay on with his militia as a part-timer. He
said on weekends, he would head south to Amal bases, where the
fighters would regroup.
   ``I don't believe that the war's over once and for all,'' he
said. ``I won't burn my bridges.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students hurled
rocks and firebombs at riot police in Seoul and three other cities
Thursday to protest the arrest of a fugitive student leader.
   Violent protests flared after Song Gap-suk was arrested along
with two bodyguards in a police raid Wednesday on his hideout in
Seoul.
   Song, 24, who heads a nationwide group of student radicals known
as Chondaehyup, was wanted by police for more than five months for
his role in violent anti-U.S. and anti-government demonstrations.
   Police said Song jumped from a second-floor apartment window to
escape but was stopped by security officials outside. There was a
pool of blood in his room indicating a struggle, news reports said.
   Song's group was responsible for several violent attacks on
government offices and U.S. installations. Last week, 11 radical
students were arrested for trying to attack the U.S. Embassy in
central Seoul, hurling firebombs and wielding steel pipes.
   There were no reports of arrests in Thursday's protests but
about 20 students and police were injured, officials said.
   The most violent protests broke out in Song's hometown of
Kwangju where 1,700 students clashed with riot police after
anti-government rallies at Chonnam and Chosun Universities, they
said.
   Kwangju was the scene of a bloody anti-government civil uprising
in 1980 in which about 200 people died and more than 1,500 others
were injured.
   The national Yonhap News Agency said police fired barrages of
tear gas to block 1,000 Chonnam University students from marching
into the streets after a campus rally. Students fought with rocks
and firebombs for 90 minutes, it said.
   Almost simultaneously, about 700 students from Chosun University
also clashed with riot police in a different section of Kwangju,
150 miles south of Seoul, Yonhap said.
   ``Release Chairman Song!'' Yonhap quoted students as shouting.
   In Seoul, about 500 students, calling for the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo battled police at Korea University for more
than an hour and pledged to step up anti-government rioting.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted after burning an
effigy of the president in front of their school.
   The students also demanded the disbandment of the main
government military intelligence organization, the Military
Security Command, which has been under fire for spying on
civilians.
   Roh fired the defense minister and the head of the intelligence
agency after it was found to have conducted illegal spying on more
than 1,300 opposition politicians, dissidents and radical students.
   In the southeastern city of Taegu, about 20 students and police
officers were injured in two different clashes, Yonhap said. A
police officer suffered serious burns on his face and body when he
was hit by exploding firebombs, it said.
   In Suwon, about 25 miles south of Seoul, police fired warning
shots into the air and arrested six protesters when a dozen
students demanding Song's release attacked a police station with
firebombs, the agency said.
   Radical students are a small but vocal minority on Korean
campuses. They have little public support because of their extreme
views and violent tactics.

   The 1941 children's literary
classic ``My Friend Flicka'' was pulled from fifth- and sixth-grade
optional reading lists in this town after parents complained it
contained vulgar language.
   The book contains the word ``bitch,'' in reference to a female
dog, and the word ``damn.''
   Another children's book, ``Abel's Island,'' was removed from the
list because of references to drinking wine.
   George Bush - not the president, but an insurance agent who is
vice chairman of the Clay County School Board - said the decision
to remove the books from the lists was made by school
administrators. He said he supports the action.
   The two titles are among several listed by Boston-based
publisher Houghton Mifflin in its reading textbooks as suggested
additional reading.
   Bush noted that the school board hasn't banned the books
outright. Dawn Wilson, supervisor of elementary curriculum, said
both books will still be available in school libraries, but
teachers will no longer have the option of assigning them.
   Alexander Caswell, spokesman for Houghton Mifflin, said he has
never heard of any other complaints about the two books. He said
the company's reading texts are in use in several hundred school
systems.
   In the wake of the decision, Bush said he would request copies
of all reading books and set up a workshop to review them.

<HEAD>Survey: 74 Incumbents With No Challengers Still Raise $10 Million
From PACs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy House members who faced no primary
challenge and have no major opposition in next month's elections
have accepted $10.4 million in political action committee
donations, according to a survey released Thursday.
   The 70 are among 74 representatives with no major party
opposition in the Nov. 6 elections. The 74 have raised $19.6
million since their last election, with 53 percent of that total
coming from special-interest PACs.
   The survey by Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader-founded public
interest group, said the number of House members running without
major party opposition was up 25 percent from 59 in 1988.
   ``Congress has designed a campaign finance system so favorable
to incumbents that challengers have become an endangered species,''
Public Citizen president Joan Claybrook said in a statement.
   The organization has unsuccessfully lobbied for public financing
of congressional elections and sharp restrictions on PAC giving.
   The special-interest money available to incumbents allows them
to build formidable warchests that discourage opposition, Public
Citizen said.
   The survey was based on Federal Election Commission reports
filed last week.
   Of the 74, Public Citizen said 46 received more in PAC
contributions than in individual contributions. Indeed, PAC
contributions accounted for at least 70 percent of the donations
received by a dozen of the lawmakers.
   Four of the 74 accepted no PAC money. They are Republican Reps.
Bill Archer of Texas, Philip Crane of Illinois and Jim Leach of
Iowa and Democratic Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts.
   Of the 70 in the group who did accept some PAC donations, Public
Citizen said Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois was the
leading recipient, accepting $456,595 in PAC money from Jan. 1,
1989 through Sept. 30, the cutoff date for the latest reports.

   Foreign Minister David Levy on Thursday
rejected the latest U.N. Security Council censure of Israel and
urged the world to focus on enforcing U.N. demands that Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Levy's comments came one day after the Security Council rebuked
Israel for not cooperating with a U.N. investigation into the
killing Oct. 8 of 19 Palestinians on Jerusalem's Temple Mount.
   Israeli soldiers, meanwhile, blocked the 1.7 million
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Israel
for a second day Thursday in an effort to stem Arab-Jewish
violence.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens ordered the ban on Palestinians
entering after five people were killed and 11 wounded this week in
several revenge attacks by Arabs and Jews that date to the Temple
Mount deaths.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, the local branch of PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction distributed a leaflet condemning
attacks on Jews and saying that Jewish and Arab blood should not be
spilled.
   ``Blood is blood, with the same color, and there is no
difference in religions,'' it said. The leaflet was apparently
meant to counter calls from Moslem fundamentalist groups for
attacks on Israelis.
   Levy made his comment in a talk with diplomats, including U.S.
Ambassador William Brown. The session was private but a Levy aide
later quoted and summarized his statements.
   According to the aide, Levy told the ambassadors that Israel
could not agree to a U.N. mission coming to investigate the
killings because the resolution that ordered the inquiry was
biased.
   ``It is prejudging Israel's guilt, ascertaining at the outset
that Jerusalem is an occupied area and that ways should be found to
protect the Palestinians. We cannot agree to that,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Levy emphasized the world's main task should be enforcing
Security Council resolutions on the Persian Gulf and not trying to
link Israel to the Iraqi problem in Kuwait, said the aide, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, director-general of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's office, also said Israel would ignore the latest U.N.
rebuke.
   Aharon told Israel army radio he hoped criticism of Israel could
be quieted by its own investigation of the Temple Mount deaths.
News reports said results of the Israeli inquiry may be issued
Friday and will blame senior police officials for the deaths.
   State-owned television reported ``rumors abound that serious
conclusions will be drawn and of heads rolling,'' after the Temple
Mount investigation report is published Friday.
   Police Minister Roni Milo was quoted by the television as
promising all recommendations of the commission would be carried
out.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said the government was
disappointed with the Washington vote for the U.N. resolution.
   ``We are sorry because this helps (Iraqi President) Saddam
Hussein to distract the attention from what is happening in the
gulf ... to what is happening in Jerusalem,'' he told reporters.
   Faisal Husseini, the leading PLO supporter in Jerusalem,
compared Israel's response to Iraq's similar disregard for U.N.
resolutions. He said the two U.N. votes against Israel were part of
a new direction by the world body.
   ``If this new system will start dealing in an unbalanced way -
dealing with Iraq in one way and Israel in another way - it means
the system will be destroyed,'' he told a news conference.
   Husseini spoke a day after he was released from jail. He had
been held on suspicion he incited stone throwing on the Temple
Mount, leading to the police charge with live gunfire. Husseini,
arrested the day of the killings, was freed on bail while police
continue their investigation.
   On Thursday, Palestinians staged a general strike under orders
from the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement, which called on
Palestinians to defy army orders and go to the week's main prayers
at the Mount on Friday.
   With Arabs blocked from entering Israel, army radio reported
that employment agencies received calls from 1,000 businesses
looking for 4,500 workers to replace Arabs in such low-paying jobs
as construction work and dishwashing.
   In Tel Aviv, Deputy Police Superintendent Shlomo Turjeman said
some employers were hiding their Arab workers so police could not
force them back to the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Remains of Student Protester Jan Palach Moved to Prague</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of Jan Palach, a
student who burned himself to death to protest the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion, were transferred Thursday to one of the capital's most
honored burial places.
   The ceremony was attended by leading officials of the
non-Communist government, including Mayor Jaroslav Koran and
President Vaclav Havel, according to official television.
   Palach's self-immolation has come to symbolize opposition to the
1968 invasion, which the Soviets launched to wipe out fledgling
reforms and restore hard-line rule.
   Havel, himself a former dissident, was arrested by Communist
authorities on Jan. 16, 1989, as he tried to place flowers in
memory of Palach on Prague's Wenceslas Square.
   Havel's arrest and 8-month prison sentence touched off street
protests and a bloody crackdown. Eleven months later, a peaceful
revolution toppled Communist authorities, leading to Havel's
selection as president.
   Palach was originally buried in Prague's Olsany cemetery after
he died from burns he suffered when he set himself on fire on
Wenceslas Square in January 1969.
   His original grave became a place of pilgrimage for those who
opposed the Soviet-led crackdown and the Communist government.
   In 1973, at the Communist government's instigation, his remains
were cremated, and the urn with his ashes was moved to his native
village of Vsetaty, 18 miles north of Prague.
   They were moved back to Olsany cemetery, one of Prague's most
revered burial spots, on Thursday.

<HEAD>Public Citizen Backtracks Second Time on Insurance Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The consumer organization Public Citizen
backtracked for a second time in a week Thursday from its critical
study of the insurance industry, saying it had been wrong in saying
that Aetna's property and casualty surpluses had declined.
   Last Friday, the consumer group admitted a similar mistake in
its analysis of the surpluses of the ITT Hartford insurance group.
   ``We have concluded that neither Hartford nor Aetna should have
been highlighted in the report,'' Public Citizen said.
   It said the two companies failed only three of the standards it
used to judge vulnerability to insolvency.
   The original report, issued Oct. 15, said that five of the
nation's top 20 property and casualty insurance companies had
failed four of the tests, indicating they might go under in the
event of a severe economic downturn.
   The five were Aetna, American International Group, Hartford,
Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty.
   All of the companies disputed the accuracy of the report.
   ``Public Citizen stands by its report,'' the consumer group
said. ``The insurance industry is vulnerable to a pattern of
insolvencies and urgently requires stronger federal and state
regulation to ensure that consumers are protected.
   ``Further, the insurance industry's vituperative attack on our
report shows that it is painfully aware of its overall accuracy and
credibility,'' the organization said. ``Unfortunate as it is, the
mathematical error cited above does not affect the validity of the
entire report.''
   Public Citizen said it employed an independent auditor to go
over its figures, and the audit showed that Aetna's surpluses
increased by 3 percent between 1972 and 1988, instead of declining,
as originally reported.

   An executive nabbed on a litter violation told a
hearing examiner Thursday that he's a samaritan who was wronged by
city sanitation enforcement agents.
   But Jim Hart, spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said that
however good their intentions, it's illegal for people to put big
stuff in the city's litter baskets.
   ``It's a tough situation,'' said Hart. ``We're asking people to
pick up litter.'' But they risk a summons if they put it in the
wrong place.
   Hart said people sometimes fill up litter baskets with
residential and commercial waste, leaving no room for tissues,
napkins and hot dog wrappers.
   He said the litter basket law, which has been on the books 30 or
40 years, is being enforced more frequently as budget constraints
are limiting the number of workers available to empty litter
baskets.
   Hart said new litter baskets are now being set out with a
version of the international ``No'' sign: a red circle with a slash
through it, surrounding a picture of a chair, television, plastic
garbage bag and a box.
   The hearing resulted from a summons given to Warren Mitofsky,
executive director of Voter Research and Surveys, which does
election exit polls and projections for the major television
networks.
   He says he was walking in Greenwich Village, about a block from
a building he owns, last month when he saw two empty, cardboard
boxes someone had thrown onto the street. He saw an empty trash can
nearby. He stashed the trash.
   ``I was halfway down the next block when a van pulled up with
three sanitation police officers in it,'' said Mitofsky.
   They gave him a summons with a potential fine of $50 to $100.
   Mitofsky went to his hearing alone. ``I don't think it's
necessary to take a lawyer to garbage court,'' he said.
   The hearing examiner listened to his story without comment and
said a decision would be mailed to him in two to three weeks.
   ``This is outrageous,'' said Mitofsky. ``We've got a filthy city
and they're trying to fine citizens who pick it up.''

   Federal regulators approved on Thursday a plan
to sell or close about 192 failed savings and loan institutions
over the next six months.
   The proposed action, which involves assets valued at $119
billion, is part of an operating plan for the Resolution Trust
Corporation, established to oversee the bailout of the financially
devastated thrift industry.
   Officials of the RTC oversight board approved the new plan. They
said its implementation would bring to about 479 the total number
of thrifts whose financial problems have been resolved by
liquidation or other actions since Aug. 9, 1989.
   But they noted that the plan is subject to the congressional
appropriations process and cannot be completed unless it receives
full financing.
   Under the plan, the trust corporation's oversight board would
authorize $62.2 billion in new financing.
   This would include $23 billion to resolve the financial problems
of the 192 savings institutions and $38.9 billion in working
capital to be borrowed through the Federal Financing Bank.
   ``The RTC has proposed an ambitious plan for the first six
months of fiscal 1991 (which began on Oct. 1) which will allow it
to continue a high level of resolutions,'' said Peter H. Monroe,
the president of the oversight board.
   ``If the RTC meets its target of 192 new resolutions, it will
have sold or closed approximately 90 percent of all thrifts seized
by the RTC to date,'' Monroe said.
   The oversight board sets policy, approves the financing and
provides general oversight supervision for the Resolution Trust
Corp. in its task of liquidating the nation's failed savings and
loan associations.

   It may be time to write Superwoman's obituary.
If the results of a poll released Thursday reflect a new
generation, the legions of American women trying to have it all may
soon dwindle.
   The 505 young men and women surveyed in the Time magazine poll
agreed there is too much pressure on women to juggle the burdens of
work and family.
   But the biggest surprise in the poll: 48 percent of the men
would like to stay home and raise their kids.
   The poll of people between the ages of 18 and 24 showed four out
of five believe it is ``very difficult'' or ``somewhat difficult''
to balance a career, marriage and children.
   ``These people are smart enough to realize that the whole myth
of the superwoman of the 1980s is just that - a myth,'' said Frank
McBride, who directed the poll for Yankelovich Clancy Shulman.
   ``Even though they were raised in an era when women were going
to do everything, men and women alike are realizing that you can't
have everything without any pain,'' he said.
   Those polled also appeared to harbor few illusions about hard
times ahead for them.
   When asked the prospects of a having a good marriage today, 56
percent of the women and 55 percent of the men said it was
``difficult.'' The other choices were ``very difficult,'' ``easy''
and ``very easy.''
   So much for the idealism of youth. A paltry 3 percent of women
and 4 percent of men believe matrimony will be ``very easy.''
   Eighty-five percent of both the men and women surveyed said
couples in their generation are more likely to get divorced than
their parents' generation.
   In keeping with a shift from the frenzied work ethic of the
1980s to more traditional values, the majority of women listed
having a happy marriage as more important than a successful career.
   By a narrow margin, 32 percent of men listed their careers as
their priority and 30 percent chose a successful marriage as most
important.
   Twenty-three percent of the women and 9 percent of the men said
that having well-adjusted children was their priority.
   Eighty-six percent of the men said they were looking for a mate
who is ambitious and hardworking. Women cited fidelity and
industriousness as their priorities in a spouse.
   Some attitudes never change.
   When asked if they think it's easier to be a man or a woman, 65
percent of men and 59 percent of women agreed it's still a man's
world.
   The Time telephone poll taken between Sept. 5 and Sept. 11
consisted of 45 questions pertaining to love, marriage, family and
work.
   The margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percent.

   The government will not tolerate hate
crimes, such as those outlined in the indictment of six alleged
members of a skinhead group, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
said Thursday.
   The 13-count federal indictment filed Wednesday charges the six
with assaulting and intimidating minorities and their friends in
Tulsa parks, bars and amusement parks from July 1988 to August
1989.
   ``Their hate crimes are not just a threat to their victims, but
a threat to the first civil right of every American,'' Thornburgh
said at a news conference. ``We want to send an unmistakable signal
that their intimidation is totally unacceptable.''
   During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the Justice
Department obtained convictions against all 46 defendants charged
with hate crimes in federal courts nationwide, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General James P. Turner told reporters in Washington.
   About 90 percent of those charged with hate crimes during the
previous fiscal year were convicted, Turner said.
   Indicted Wednesday were Michael Lawrence, Daniel Roush, Forrest
Hyde, Tina Christopher, Christopher Jones and Gregory Kennicutt.
   All were in custody, said U.S. Attorney Tony Graham.
   Nine others associated with the Tulsa skinhead group, including
five juveniles, already have pleaded guilty to hate crime charges,
Graham said.
   Lawrence was among five people convicted in Dallas earlier this
year for civil rights conspiracies against minorities. He was
sentenced to federal prison.
   Jones is serving a sentence at an Oklahoma state prison, said
Graham. The other four were arrested Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   After resigning, Donald Lukens sat back and
watched his former House colleagues on TV, ``realized what a zoo it
was,'' paid a late-night Capitol visit to pick up his belonging,
and left.
   His office was empty of photographs and personal mementos
Thursday when staff members arrived for their first day of work
with no congressman for a boss.
   An aide said Lukens cleared out his things late Wednesday night
after resigning his House seat in the face of a sexual-misconduct
allegation. The Ohio Republican said in a one-sentence letter to
Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste that his decision was ``for the good of
the Congress.''
   Celeste on Thursday ordered a special election to fill the
vacancy.
   That election will be Nov. 6 - the same day as Ohio's general
election - unless candidates other than the two nominated in the
May primary file petitions for the post. If others do file
petitions of candidacy, which they must do by Saturday, then a
primary election would be held Nov. 6 and a special general
election Nov. 21.
   House Clerk Donnald K. Anderson appointed Lukens' chief of
staff, William Jarrell, to oversee constituent work and run the
office until a new representative is sworn in.
   The Ohio Republican ``was in good spirits,'' Jarrell said, when
he returned to the Cannon House Office Building to pack his things
and mark them for delivery to friends, family members and his farm
in Ohio.
   ``He said that he was watching C-Span on TV yesterday and they
were arguing about seafood regulation, and for the first time in a
long time he realized what a zoo it was.''
   Lukens had been a lame duck since May, when he was defeated in
the Republican primary. ``We had been in the process of wrapping up
and getting things together. All this has done is accelerate the
process by a very little bit,'' Jarrell said.
   Lukens isn't eligible to receive his pension until 1993 and
doesn't have a job lined up. ``He has not decided what he's going
to do,'' Jarrell said. ``He really wasn't able to concentrate on
(job-hunting) while he was here.''
   Lukens' resignation followed by two days the House ethics
committee's vote to revive its dormant case against him to include
a new accusation that he fondled a House elevator operator earlier
this month.
   The committee earlier had been examining whether Lukens had
violated House rules by having sex relations with a 16-year-old
girl - an episode that led to a misdemeanor conviction in Ohio last
year.
   The 59-year-old congressman, who is divorced, has been free on
bond while appealing that conviction to the state Supreme Court.

   A valve loosened by a bump in a road is
believed to have caused a hydrochloric acid spill that partially
melted an asphalt highway and forced the evacuation of about 200
people, officials said Thursday.
   The Wednesday night spill left a steaming trail of melted
asphalt on about a half-mile of U.S. Highway 71, said State Police
Sgt. Hamilton Mixon.
   Five Alexandria police officers were among the 19 people taken
to area hospitals and treated for exposure to fumes, said Beverly
Herring of the Alexandria Police Department.
   ``None of them were seriously hurt. The acid fumes kind of burn
your skin and make it hard to breathe when you're in it,'' she
said.
   A motorist traveling north on U.S. Highway 71 noticed something
leaking from a tanker truck after it hit a bump in the road.
   The motorist flagged the truck driver down, but not before
almost 600 gallons of the acid had spilled onto the highway.
   James Kemp, assistant manager of a nearby service station, said
he called 911 after noticing the tanker was leaving a trail of
steam-like vapor.
   ``The road was smoking from behind the truck,'' Kemp said. ``It
looked like steam rising off the ground.''
   A partial evacuation of homes near the spill was ordered shortly
after the accident and was canceled about 8{ hours later, said
State Police Trooper Michael Hataway.
   Hydrochloric acid is a colorless, corrosive liquid. Inhaling its
vapor can irritate the mouth, nose, throat and lungs, causing
coughing, shortness of breath, pulmonary edema and even death.
   Emergency workers spread soda ash powder on the road to
neutralize the acid. The company that owned the truck, Alpha-Chem
of Reserve, sent a cleanup crew to the scene.
   Mixon said officials were investigating possible charges against
the truck driver.

<TEXT>
   Seventy-two congressman demanded Thursday that
prison officials tell them why Manuel Noriega has an exercise bike,
paper shredder, copier, computer and two safes in his jail cell.
   Attorneys for the deposed Panamanian leader said the three-room
cell and its furnishings were forced on their client by government
security regulations and prosecutor's insistence that classified
information be protected.
   U.S. Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., fired off a letter to the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons after reading in The Miami Herald about the
facilities at Noriega's cell in the Metropolitan Correctional
Center outside Miami. The letter was co-signed by 71 other
congressmen from both parties.
   ``It's obviously special treatment, and if the taxpayers are
paying for it, it's disgraceful,'' Smith said Thursday. ``Who puts
safes in criminal's quarters - I don't understand that at all. What
if he had a gun in there?''
   The prison agency did not immediately return telephone calls
from The Associated Press. Smith said he expected a reply by
Friday.
   Noriega's defense attorney, Jon May, said Smith and the other
lawmakers will be disappointed with the answer. And he said the
defense attorneys and their client would be happy to relinquish
most perks.
   ``Noriega has a bicycle propped up on a stand because he's in
isolation,'' said May. ``He does not have access to the volleyball
field or the weight room or any of the other facilities the other
prisoners have.''
   Prosecutors provided the defense team with the shredder, copying
machine, computers and safes to handle reams of classified
information, May said.
   ``The sole reason they were provided at MCC is that I cannot
meet with the general in the regular conference area,'' said May.
The computer and copying machine are in a room the lawyers use, and
Noriega has no access to them, he said.
   The government insisted on the safes to protect classified
information, said May.
   ``Would Congressman Smith want classified information kept
loosely in the general's cell, the way other papers are kept?'' he
asked.
   The special cell was built because MCC is not as secure as
federal prisons in Atlanta and Marion, Ill., where the government
initially wanted to send Noriega following his surrender to U.S.
authorities in Panama.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler decided that moving Noriega
would place a burden on his defense team in the complicated
drug-trafficking case.
   ``I would invite the congressman to come to MCC and see the
general's situation,'' the attorney said. ``It's not because he's
afforded special privileges; it's because he has fewer
privileges.''
   Noriega has been at the prison since January, when he
surrendered two weeks after the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   He is being held on a February 1988 indictment accusing him of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes to protect Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel operations in Panama.

<TEXT>
   The parliament of the Slovak
republic on Thursday made Slovak the official language, but
protesters seeking stronger legislation demanded that lawmakers
resign.
   The law was approved by a vote of 82-51 with 10 abstentions
after a nearly all-day debate. Thousands of demonstrators had
waited outside parliament in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, for
lawmakers to decide.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel and top foreign leaders have
expressed worries that nationalism will upset this country's
stability and damage efforts to shed its Communist past.
   Some Slovaks, whose republic makes up the more rural, eastern
part of the country, say they have been dominated too long by
Czechs from the national capital, Prague.
   The law approved late Thursday declares Slovak the official
language, but it allows minorities to use their own language for
official communications in regions where they make up at least 10
percent of the population.
   A tougher version, backed by the separatist Slovak National
Party, had called for Slovak to be the official language without
exception.
   Slovakia has sizeable minorities. The largest is an ethnic
Hungarian population of at least 570,000, which makes up more than
10 percent of the republic's population.
   Vitazoslav Moric, chairman of the Slovak National Party, told
about 8,000 demonstrators outside parliament that lawmakers were
ignoring the will of the Slovak majority.
   ``The rally considers the parliament as illegitimate and unable
to represent the interests of the Slovak nation,'' he said in
remarks reported by the CTK news agency. ``For this reason, we
demand the resignation of the deputies of parliament and new
elections.''
   He also promised ``protest actions in the whole territory of the
Slovak republic which will include also civil disobedience.''
   After the vote was announced, the protesters chanted slogans
against the government and parliament, and speakers called for a
republic-wide strike to start Friday and last until the government
falls.
   The version of the law approved by parliament was proposed by
the coalition of Public Against Violence, the Christian Democratic
Movement and the Democratic Party, CTK said.
   Public Against Violence is the partner of the Czech land's Civic
Forum. It is the largest single party in the Slovak parliament,
with 48 seats.
   The Christian Democratic Movement has 31, and the Democratic
Party has seven. Among the three groups, they hold a majority of
seats.
   The Slovak National Party has 22 parliamentary seats.
   CTK also reported that Havel criticized the separatist Slovak
party while speaking to a parliamentary committee of the Czech
republic.
   The news agency quoted Havel as saying the Slovak National Party
had used the language issue to organize large demonstrations. He
said many people who took part did not know what the question was
or what the differences were among different proposals.
   ``The main source for doubts about Czechoslovakia abroad are the
problems of the constitutional arrangement of our country,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``All potential partners, economic or political,
are waiting for Czechoslovakia to be a united and disciplined
partner.''

   Brilliantly colored fall foliage was coated with snow and ice
Thursday in the mountains of North Carolina and frost headed as far
south as Alabama.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended during the afternoon over
North Carolina, South Carolina, northeastern Georgia, eastern
Tennessee and southwestern Virginia.
   The rain was mixed with snow in the Appalachians and changed
completely to snow at higher elevations.
   ``It was very pretty on these colored leaves,'' said Beulah
Calhoun at Calhoun Farm Supply in Newland, N.C.
   Elsewhere in North Carolina, 8 inches of snow accumulated at
Mount Mitchell and Mount Pisgah got a little more than an inch, the
National Weather Service reported. The National Park Service closed
two sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina because of
snow.
   ``I hear there is enough to scrape up a snowball,'' said Hugh
Morton at Grandfather Mountain.
   In eastern Tennessee, snow closed the Clingman Dome road in the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the weather service said.
   At lower elevations in North Carolina, thunderstorms produced
locally heavy rain at Charlotte, including 1.50 inches in the six
hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, and across much of Mecklenburg County,
flooding some streets and roads, the weather service said.
   Hail about an inch in diameter fell at Locust, N.C.
   A tornado warning was issued for part of eastern North Carolina
after a waterspout was spotted offshore. The waterspout, a tornado
that forms over water, did not come ashore.
   Cold air headed southward across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys
with temperatures expected to reach the low 30s by Friday morning
in northern Alabama, and the mid to upper 30s across central and
southern Alabama.
   Frost advisories were posted over much of Kentucky and frost
warnings were issued over southwestern Ohio. Advisories for frost
and freezing temperatures were posted over Indiana and southeastern
Lower Michigan.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered over western New York state and
northeastern Ohio.
   Rain extended from north-central and western Washington state
into northwestern Oregon.
   Strong, gusty wind blew across the northern Pacific Coast during
the morning, with gusts reaching 44 mph at Astoria, Ore., 47 mph at
Bellingham, Wash., and 56 mph at Seaside, Ore.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 19 degrees in
Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34

<HEAD>Maronite Churchmen Accuse Syrians of Executions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's Maronite Catholic Church on
Thursday accused Syrian forces of summarily executing soldiers
loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun when he was defeated in battle this
month.
   The clergymen also demanded the release of rebel officers
detained by the Syrian army. They appealed to the Syrian-backed
government of Elias Hrawi to arrange the evacuation of Syrian
troops from monasteries and Christian hospitals.
   The buildings in Aoun's stronghold were occupied after Syrian
and government troops stormed his rebel army on Oct. 13, forcing
the defeated general to flee to the French Embassy.
   The statement issued by the archbishops of the Maronite
community, the largest Christian sect in Lebanon, said ``some of
Gen. Aoun's officers had been deliberately killed, and others are
being held by non-Lebanese authorities.
   ``This is a humiliation that cannot be justified by the fall of
casualties in the opposite side, for whom we feel sorry.''
   The clergymen were alluding to reports of summary executions of
supporters of Aoun after they surrendered to the Syrians, who lost
300 soldiers in the battle. About 250 other people were killed.
   Hrawi's government has denied that Aoun's followers were
executed, saying all casualties fell in the fighting.
   It was not clear from the church statement how many of Aoun's
followers have been detained.
   Hrawi is a Maronite, like Aoun. The million-member community has
dominated power in Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.

<TEXT>
   The White House on Thursday all but invited
the firing of a high-ranking Republican campaign official who told
GOP candidates to feel free to break away from President Bush's
policies.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to express
confidence in the official, Edward J. Rollins. Rollins is
co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and
a onetime political director in Ronald Reagan's White House.
   Despite the White House unhappiness with his remark, Rollins'
job apparently is safe - for now. ``There was no suggestion of Ed's
leaving before the election,'' said Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich.,
chairman of the committee. He spoke with reporters after Bush met
with GOP leaders.
   Rollins angered the White House with an Oct. 15 memo advising
candidates ``on necessary changes in your campaign theme and
message.'' Rollins said the mood of the country had shifted
dramatically over the past 10 days and that voters were as
pessimistic about the direction of the country as at any time in
history.
   Saying that voters were confused about Republican positions on
taxes, Rollins wrote, ``Do not hesitate to oppose either the
president or (budget) proposals advanced in Congress.''
   The GOP committee played down the flap.
   ``Is he in hot water? Good question,'' said John Roberts,
communications director of the congressional committee. ``We don't
have any indication that he is. Honestly, if in fact the president
wanted him replaced, we haven't heard it.'' Bush, during a Rose
Garden appearance, dodged questions about Rollins.
   Fitzwater said Rollins' remarks ``were not helpful. I think the
National Republican Congressional Committee will be able to take
charge of this situation.''
   Asked if Rollins should be fired, Fitzwater replied, ``That's up
to the committee.''
   Roberts said Rollins has made a commitment to work for the
committee through the 1992 elections. ``I think he probably will
honor that commitment.''
   Republicans have abandoned Bush in droves on the budget, and
some GOP candidates are avoiding the president, shelving political
commercials he's made on their behalf. Bush even has been
confronted by criticism on the campaign trail by candidates he is
supporting.
   A senior White House official said there was a distinction
between opposing the budget plan endorsed by Bush and appearing to
attack the president.
   ``He doesn't mind them beating up on the deal; there's nobody
who likes them beating up on him,'' said the official, insisting on
anonymity.
   Trying to squelch talk of GOP disarray, Fitzwater said,
``President Bush is a great asset to any Republican.''
   Pressed on whether Rollins should be fired, Fitzwater said,
``This is a matter for the committee. He works for them. We
certainly made our views known. ... Obviously we're not happy with
his comments the other day.''
   The White House hurriedly arranged a ``unity'' picture of Bush
and GOP leaders in Congress, including Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, who led Republicans in abandoning Bush and his original
budget deal with the Democrats.
   ``I think all of us are totally united in our determination to
take a sound, strong Republican message across this country,'' Bush
said.
   ``The point is, we're unified and trying to win these
elections,'' the president said.
   Gingrich said the GOP leaders wanted to meet with Bush ``to lay
out the framework for the campaign for the last 10 days of the
year.'' The congressmen said Republicans have sharp differences
with Democrats on issues such as crime, drugs, government
regulations and taxes.
   Gingrich refused to pledge support for the latest budget deal.
   While stressing unity, House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill., said, ``There are those issues, from time to time, on which
we can't all be together. And this happens to be one of those.''

<HEAD>U.S. Bishop Defends Meeting With Married Ex-Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. bishop on Thursday defended a meeting he held
with married former priests. He spoke after reports the Vatican had
frowned on the session because it could encourage opponents of the
rule of priestly celibacy.
   The bishop, Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh, has been in Rome this
month for an international gathering of bishops convened by Pope
John Paul II to discuss the formation of priests.
   Although celibacy wasn't on the synod's official agenda, several
bishops have raised questions about the Roman Catholic church's
insistence that priests lead celibate lives.
   Wuerl said his meeting with the ex-priests in June in the United
States shouldn't be construed as a criticism of church policy
requiring that priests abstain from sex and marriage.
   ``I listen to what someone has to say, but then I say what I
have to say,'' Wuerl said. ``... I think those kind of
conversations go on all the time, not just on priestly celibacy ...
but on every aspect.''
   The New York Times reported Wednesday that Wuerl had received a
letter from the Vatican warning that such encounters could erode
the church's celibacy rule.
   Referring to the Vatican's interest in the encounter, Wuerl
said, ``A request came for information about what happened ... to
which I responded as was my responsibility. ... Any other
interpretation of that I'm really not comfortable with because it
takes it beyond the fact.''
   Wuerl spoke at a news conference with Archbishop Daniel E.
Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, who heads the U.S. bishops' conference.
   Asked if the synod would further debate celibacy, Pilarczyk
said: ``If debate means discussion, nobody can put an end to any
discussion. If debate means considering whether a law or discipline
should be changed ... in that sense the debate is closed.''
   Wuerl, following Pilarczyk's distinction between ``discussion''
and ``debate,'' used the word ``discussion''to describe his
meeting with the former priests.
   ``If you're talking to someone about something very dear to
them, that's a discussion,'' Wuerl said.
   The Vatican's letter was reportedly sent by Cardinal Antonio
Innocenti, head of the Vatican office that oversees clergy.
   Speaking of the sentiments expressed at the synod, now in its
fourth week, Pilarczyk said: ``My perception is that bishops on the
whole, the vast, vast majority, are saying we want to reaffirm the
usefulness and appropriateness of priestly celibacy as strongly as
we can.''
   A cardinal from Brazil disclosed earlier in the synod that two
married men in his country had become priests with papal approval.
The Vatican on occasion has also approved married priests who
converted to Roman Catholicism from Christian denominations without
celibacy rules.

   A large majority of Roman Catholics oppose
U.S. bishops' involvement in abortion politics, according to a
survey released Thursday by a private group of Catholics.
   The poll commissioned by Catholics for a Free Choice found that
71 percent of Catholics and 74 percent of all respondents said
Catholic bishops should not ``use the political arena to advance
their moral opinions.''
   ``What we find is that Catholics and non-Catholics are opposed
to the style and approach the bishops are taking on abortion
politics,'' Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free
Choice, said at a news conference.
   Helen Alvare, public information director at the pro-life office
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, disagreed withthe
results of the survey.
   ``It promotes the idea that the bishops shouldn't speak out on
the human rights issue of abortion,'' she said. ``It would prefer
to gag us as moral leaders in the public square.
   ``In fact, the bishops won't be silenced on any human rights
issue, including thinks like economic justice, civil rights or
abortion,'' Alvare said, contending that most of the poll questions
involved the church's getting involved in elections, ``which we
don't do.''
   She also said the survey did not distinguish between regular
church-going Catholics and Catholics who don't go to church
regularly.
   Kissling said the U.S. Catholic Conference and a number of
bishops were inappropriately participating in the political process
by attacking individual candidates and elected officials whose
views on abortion differ from theirs.
   She pointed to several examples, including Cardinal John
O'Connor raising the possibility of excommunicating pro-choice
Catholics and Guam's bishop threatening Catholic lawmakers with
excommunication if they voted against the territory's new abortion
bill.
   ``They have a right to preach against abortion, but they have no
right to coerce,'' she said, contending the bishops have been
``using legislators as their own private police force.''
   She also cited the bishops' hiring of a public relations company
and a polling firm for a nationwide campaign to persuade Catholics
and non-Catholics to oppose abortion.
   Of the 2,002 adults polled nationwide, 523 said they were
Catholic. The margin of error for the entire sampling is 2.1
percentage points and the margin of error for the sample of
Catholics is 4.2 percentage points.
   The poll was conducted by KRC Research and Consulting Inc.
Surveying was done by telephone Oct. 12-21.
   Catholics for a Free Choice describes itself as a national
education organization that supports the right to legal
reproductive health care, especially the right to family planning
and abortion.

<TEXT>
   The appeals of Florida prisoners who
are condemned to die are badly backed up and the system needs
streamlining, the state Supreme Court said in naming a committee to
investigate the problem.
   The high court also cited the problem when it stayed the
executions of two death row inmates scheduled for the electric
chair Nov. 28. Their execution dates were postponed until March
because the state office that represents condemned murderers says
it doesn't have the staff or money to take the cases.
   The state agency working on behalf of the condemned is called
the Capital Collateral Representative. Larry Spalding, who heads
the agency, said Thursday he welcomes the court's effort.
   ``Last year for example ... 27 people did the work of 70,''
Spalding said. ``Of that number 10 lawyers did the work of 32 - and
we still can't keep up.''
   Gov. Bob Martinez signs about 45 execution orders annually, he
said.
   In an administrative order Wednesday, the high court said: ``It
appears that the credibility of the entire process is being
jeopardized by the untimely way in how these matters are being
considered and resolved.''
   Peter Dunbar, the governor's general counsel, blamed the delays
on those who oppose capital punishment. He said that when private
lawyers handled death row cases, they didn't have such delays.
   ``The truth is these procedural hurdles are used by opponents of
the death penalty to frustrate the process,'' Dunbar said.
   Spalding and Dunbar are on the high court's committee, along
with Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Steven Goldstein, a Florida
State University law professor, James Fox Miller, president of the
Florida bar association, and former bar President James Rinaman.
They will study the process of appeals and make their
recommendations by March 15.
   The inmates given reprieves were Samuel Rivera and Jason Dirk
Walton.
   Rivera was condemned to death for killing a police officer at a
shopping mall in 1986. Walton was condemned for shooting three
people during a home robbery in 1982.

   Republican Clayton Williams' lead has
evaporated and he is deadlocked with Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Ann Richards, says a new poll released Thursday.
   Support for both Richards and Williams is running at 38 percent,
according to the survey by The Eppstein Group of Fort Worth.
   Twenty-four percent of voters are undecided, says the poll of
1,209 registered voters, taken Oct. 16-21.
   The poll has a margin of error of three percentage points.
   The same poll had shown Williams with a 13-point lead in August
and followed by nine days a Gallup poll that had put Williams five
percentage points ahead of Richards, at 45-40.
   Republican candidate Clayton Williams, who on Wednesday had said
he was ``nervous,'' remains confident, aides said Thursday.
   ``It's not (that) the gap is narrowing; this race is even,''
Richards said. ``There's no gap at all.''

   Albania's leading writer, Ismail Kadare, sought and
was granted asylum in France on Thursday. He said Communist
hard-liners in his homeland reneged on promises to promote
democracy.
   In southern France, meanwhile, 71 Romanian soccer fans failed to
board a chartered plane back to Bucharest, and at least 22 applied
for political asylum, authorities said.
   Kadare, 54, said he decided to seek asylum after becoming
convinced that Albania's leaders, despite reformist rhetoric, had
no intention of emulating the political changes that swept through
Eastern Europe the past year.
   ``The promises made were not kept, and my disillusion, like that
of the immense majority of Albanians, was all the more bitter,'' he
said in a statement.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas later said Kadare's request for
asylum ha been granted.
   News of the defection reached Albania as the government played
host to a conference of foreign ministers from other Balkan
nations, resulting in the unusual presence in Tirana of a large
number of foreign journalists.
   Kadare, former head of the national writer's union, occasionally
defended official policy in the past. But he became increasingly
critical in recent months, leading a group of intellectuals who
denounced the government's Stalinist ideologies and accused the
security services of abuses.
   There was no immediate official reaction to the defection, but
his decision caught many Albanians by surprise.
   Mirlinda Angoni, a journalist for the state news agency ATA,
said she thought Kadare's defection would ``provoke resentment
toward him.''
   Kadare's books are widely available in Albania, and several have
been published in France. At least two of his books, ``Doruntine''
and ``Chronicles in Stone,'' have been published in the United
States.
   Kadare's style has been compared to that of the Colombian
fabulist writer, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. His stories and novels
often deal with the country's Byzantine history and traditional
themes of honor and local custom.
   Kadare told the French newspaper Le Monde that his wife and two
daughters had accompanied him to France and would stay with him. He
said he left his mother, brother and sister behind.
   The other asylum case unfolded in the southern city of
Montpellier, where about 100 Romanians had come to watch Steaua
Bucharest play in a European Cupwinners Cup match Wednesday night.
Montpellier won 5-0.
   Officials said only about 30 Romanians left on the return flight
to Bucharest. By evening, 22 members of the group had shown up at
government offices to seek political asylum, while the others
reportedly headed north by train to Paris or Lyon.
   Kadare's bid for political asylum was first announced by his
French publisher, Claude Durand, who holds the author's
international rights.
   Kadare released the text of a letter sent Tuesday to Albanian
President Ramiz Alia explaining his decision.
   ``Until today, I have tried to help soften the regime, to the
extent this is authorized in Albania,'' he wrote. ``In the course
of my meetings and an exchange of letters which I had with the
president last spring, I expressed very clearly the necessity for a
rapid, profound and complete democratization of the country.
   ``Because there is no possibility of legal opposition in
Albania, I have chosen this course which I never wished to take and
which I will not recommend to others.''
   The author of several novels, essays and poetry collections,
Kadare had not been considered an outspoken dissident in past
years, although his recent works contained anti-totalitarian
themes.
   He described his decision as ``the logical extension of all that
I have argued for until now in my work.''
   ``I hope to return to my country one day ... following a true
democratization.'' he said.
   Kadare is fluent in French and has visited France many times.

<HEAD>Kurdish Rebels: Iraq Has Moved Some Equipment from Arms Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has shifted vital equipment from
factories making armaments and chemical weapons to secret locations
for security reasons, the rebel Kurdish group said Thursday.
   The decision was made by the Iraqi Defense Ministry early in
October, said the statement faxed to The Associated Press in
Nicosia from the Kurdistan Democratic Party's office in London.
   The statement said the group learned that on Oct. 16, the
contents of the Al Taji armaments factory in the Al Taji barracks
and the chemical plant at Samara, both north of Baghdad, were
moved.
   It added that ``other sensitive military installations have also
been vacated, except for the Al Qaim chemical plant, now
specializing in producing binary chemical shells in western Iraq.
   ``The site is the most heavily defended in Iraq by a massive
air-defense system and ground troops.''
   The fax did not elaborate on how the information has been
obtained or why the Iraqis would have moved the equipment.
   However, Iraqi authorities have moved some Western hostages to
strategic sites, fearing a U.S. air attack in the aftermath of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Kurdistan Democratic Party is an outlawed group fighting for
autonomy from the central Baghdad government for several decades.
   In another development, the official Iraqi News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia, reported that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has toured the Kurdish province of Suleimaniya to inquire about
conditions of inhabitants. It did not say when the visit occurred.
   The trip apparently was designed to boost his popularity among
the Kurds, traditionally his main opponents within Iraq.
   It said thousands of people greeted him and showed support for
his stand against anti-Iraqi forces that massed in Saudi Arabia
after the invasion.

   Monthly injections of a newly approved drug for
treating endometriosis could help hundreds of thousands of women
who have the fertility-threatening condition, doctors said
Thursday.
   The drug, a prostate-cancer medicine called Lupron Depot, is
already commonly prescribed for endometriosis. Doctors know it
works to reverse the malady and relieve its sometimes debilitating
pain, gynecologists said.
   But the government had not approved its use for treating
anything other than prostate cancer and insurance companies refused
to cover its costs - $252 for monthly injections, which are
typically administered for six months, doctors said.
   ``It's a drug that's well-tolerated. It's side effects are
minimal, and it's an exciting development that we now have
approval,'' said Dr. Gary A. Shangold, associate professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Chicago.
   He spoke at a press confeence held by the manufacturer, TAP
Pharmaceuticals. The Deerfield-based company said it was notified
Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved
Lupron Depot for treating endometriosis.
   The drug suppresses production of the female hormone estrogen,
which controls growth of the tissue that lines the womb, called the
endometrium.
   Endometriosis occurs when that tissue migrates outside the womb,
usually into the abdomen and pelvis, where it swells and bleeds
during menstruation. If it develops in the ovaries or fallopian
tubes, it can cause blockage, scarring and infertility.
   An estimated 2 million to 5 million women have endometriosis,
which may be mild and symptom free. But the condition also may
cause severe menstrual cramps, pain during sexual intercourse,
painful urination or painful bowel movements.
   Side effects of Lupron Depot resemble those of menopause,
including hot flashes, but are not permanent and may be relieved
with other medication.
   ``In essence, what we're doing is creating a temporary,
medically induced menopause, a reversible menopause, that, in turn,
stops the stimulation of the endometriosis,'' said Dr. James
Miller, medical director at TAP.
   The company is a joint venture between Japanese pharmaceutical
company Takeda Chemical Industries and North Chicago-based Abbott
Laboratories.
   Other doctors said the approval should open the way for using
the drug for a variety of gynecological problems, such as
premenstrual syndrome, uterine fibroid tumors and even benign
breast tumors.
   ``I think it's very significant,'' Dr. Robert L. Barbieri,
chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at State University of New
York at Stony Brook, said of Thursday's announcement.
   He estimated it could help up to one-third of women who have
endometriosis, including by heading off surgery.
   Barbieri said the only other drugs approved for treating
endometriosis are Synarel, a nasal spray that costs about the same
as Lupron Depot, and Danazol, a derivative of the male hormone
testosterone that costs about half as much.
   Synarel requires twice daily doses for six months and is poorly
absorbed by the body, Barbieri said. Danazol causes women to
develop male traits - a deepening of the voice, facial hair, oilier
skin and upper body muscles, he said.
   As for Lupron Depot, ``the main down side of the drug is it does
cause a low estrogen state, and it may cause thinning of vertebral
bones,'' Barbieri said. He said further study will be necessary to
determine whether the amount of bone thinning is significant.

   Unidentified assailants using guns and
machetes on Thursday killed nine peasants, including five children,
in a small town in northern Colombia.
   The peasants were attacked in their homes by the assailants who
apparently were carrying out a revenge mission, regional police
director Col. Felix Gallardo told reporters.
   Among the victims were five children aged 5 to 16, he said.
   Immediately after the massacre, police arrested 18 suspects in
the Tierralta area, about 270 miles north of the capital Bogota.
   The independent U.S.-based human rights group Americas Watch
reported on Monday that right-wing paramilitary death squads are
responsible for most of the 375 multiple murders committed in the
Colombian countryside this year.
   The squads often kill leftist guerrillas and those they suspect
of being left-wing sympathizers.

   Twenty-five Portuguese stone masons
returned to their homeland Thursday after Iraqi authorities allowed
them to leave Baghdad.
   The workers finished contracts last week to install marble in a
palace for President Saddam Hussein on the banks of the River
Tigris in the Iraqi capital.
   A spokesman for the group, Joao Cacador, said Baghdad
authorities granted exit visas to the Portuguese after the Iraqi
company supervising work on palace appealed to Saddam's office on
their behalf.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, on working visit to Spain,
said he was overjoyed to hear the Portuguese men had left Iraq.
   Iraq has held thousands of foreigners in their country in the
aftermath of the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, including Westerners in
strategic sites thought to be the targets of a possible U.S.
attack.

   A Cabinet minister acknowledged Thursday
that Sudan is facing a food crisis but the government rejected
claims by relief workers that millions of its residents are
threatened by famine.
   A top U.S. relief official, meanwhile, told Congress in
Washington on Thursday that a famine of ``biblical proportions''
imperiled as many as 11 million Sudanese.
   Sudan's agriculture minister, Ahmed Ali Genaif, speaking at a
news conference in Khartoum, said there was no famine but the
country was confronted with ``a food gap that should be handled.''
   Seasonal rains were delayed, Genaif said, prompting Western
relief organizations to raise the alarm of a food crisis, but the
rains had started and the situation was ``under control.''
   He acknowledged, however, that while projected figures showed
crops this winter should produce 400,000 tons of wheat and 1.8
million tons of sorghum, the country needs more than twice as much
wheat and 2.5 million tons of sorghum to feed its people.
   Foreign Minister Ali Sahlul met Thursday with Harold Norton, the
representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization in
Khartoum, to thank the U.N. agency for a donation of 25,000 tons of
wheat, the official Sudan News Agency reported.
   A ship loaded with 19,000 tons of wheat was ordered to sail to
Sudan immediately to help Sudan cover urgent needs.
   In Washington, Andrew Natsios, the U.S. administration's top
relief official, said the Sudanese government is ``increasingly
indifferent if not overtly hostile to the relief efforts''
undertaken by the international community.
   Most of the Sudanese threatened by famine live in southern
Sudan, where a civil war between rebels and government troops has
been waged since 1983. The government has barred food shipments to
the south, where the countryside is largely controlled by the
rebels.
   A government statement said Thursday that 22 rebels of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army had been killed at Yei in the Equatoria
region, 825 miles south of Khartoum. It said a government soldier
was also killed in the fighting, but did not say when the battle
took place.
   The report could not be independently verified because reporters
are barred from the war zone.

   A Jamaican immigrant burst into tears
Thursday after his acquittal on charges of killing a Boston police
detective, ending a trial that raised questions about whether
police doctored evidence.
   ``What they tried to do to me. ... I'm a good person,'' Albert
Lewin whispered after a jury found him innocent.
   ``I never knew that the United States was like this,'' he later
told reporters.
   Lewin, 34, had been in Boston a few months when he was accused
of firing shots that blasted through a closed apartment door and
killed Detective Sherman Griffiths during a 1988 drug raid.
   ``I think it had to be obvious to the jury that there was no
credible evidence,'' said Lewin's attorney, Max Stern.
   The only physical evidence that linked Lewin with the murder
weapon was a fingerprint on the gun. Lewin was arrested after he
was found with several other people in an apartment downstairs from
where the raid occured Feb. 17, 1988.
   Lewin still faces deportation to Jamaica as an illegal alien.
   Two defense witnesses, including a retired fingerprint expert
for state police, testified there were signs the print had been
transferred onto the gun. The fingerprint was reported by an FBI
expert some 30 months after the killing, and then was destroyed.
   ``I was disappointed,'' Thomas Mundy, assistant Suffolk County
district attorney, said of the verdict. ``I can't find fault with
the jury. ... I can't believe they didn't believe it was Lewin's
fingerprint on the gun.''
   Brian Griffiths, a brother of the 36-year-old slain officer,
read a statement saying the family was ``very hurt and
disappointed'' by the verdict.
   ``Sherman was a proud and dedicated member of the Boston Police
Department's Drug Control Unit and no decision will ever take that
away from him,'' he said. ``Sherman died for a cause and his death
will never be in vain.''
   The verdict was another setback for Boston police, still reeling
from the Charles Stuart case last October.
   In that case, a man claimed his pregnant wife had been shot by a
black man as they drove through a Boston neighborhood. Police
arrested a black man.
   When Stuart later was implicated in the slaying and committed
suicide, community leaders said police acted too quickly to arrest
a black suspect.
   The Lewin case was moved 90 miles from Boston because of
extensive publicity.

   An 84-year-old man died of injuries
from a turbulent flight aboard a commercial jetliner, authorities
said.
   Philip Romerstein died ``as a result of trauma suffered during
the turbulence,'' said Wayne Arbaczawski, chief investigator for
the Palm Beach County medical examiner's office.
   Romerstein, from West Palm Beach, had just left his seat to
visit the lavatory Oct. 3 on Eastern Airlines Flight 791 when the
turbulence hit, said airlines spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   It was not clear if falling luggage, being struck by other
passengers, or just simply being tossed about caused the trauma.
   Romerstein had been in intensive care until his death Tuesday.
   The clear-air turbulence struck at 31,000 feet when the DC-9 was
approaching Palm Beach International Airport for a landing.
   Thirteen people required medical assistance. Four of them were
seriously injured.
   Romersteins's wife, Rose, suffered back injuries. The couple was
returning from a visit to Washington for the birth of a
great-grandchild.
   An investigation determined airline employees followed proper
procedures during the flight, said Arlene Salac, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   A Democratic congresswoman trying to win
Senate votes for the civil rights bill says a Republican senator
proved the need for the bill by shooing her to the back of the
chamber.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she and other congresswomen
were in the Senate on Wednesday encouraging members to override the
president's veto of the Civil Rights Act.
   ``We have a right to be on the floor as members of Congress,''
she said. ``But Sen. (Rudy) Boschwitz kept telling us to `Go to the
back ladies.' I don't know if he didn't realize we were members of
Congress or what.
   ``There we were trying to improve conditions for women in the
workplace and we were being told 'Go to the back, ladies, go to the
back.'''
   Boschwitz' press secretary Tim Droogsma said Mrs. Pelosi was
``being loud. House members have (Senate) floor privileges. They do
not have speaking privileges.''
   Droogsma said that Boschwitz and other senators were trying to
hear the debate, but were being disturbed by Mrs. Pelosi. He said
any effort to equate the incident with sex discrimination
trivializes the Civil Rights Act.
   ``She was simply asked to take her conversation away,'' he said.
   The Minnesota senator, who is running for re-election, voted
against the Civil Rights Act when the Senate took its original
action on the bill. He voted, however, to override, becoming the
only senator to change his mind.
   Polls show that Boschwitz, who started with an enormous lead
over Democratic challenger Paul Wellstone, is now leading by only a
3 point margin.

   Nine former hostages in Iraq landed to the
applause of friends on U.S. soil Thursday night, one of them
proclaiming it was ``awesome'' to be home again.
   The nine were among 14 Americans who left Amman, Jordan for
London on Wednesday after flying out of Baghdad. Five flew to New
York, arriving Wednesday night.
   Peter Timko of Lancaster, Pa., was met at Washington's Dulles
Airport by his father, Joseph; his mother, Brenda, and a dozen
fellow graduate students from Georgetown University in Washington,
where he is a graduate student in Arabic studies. The students
carried a big sign reading, ``Welcome Home Peter.''
   Timko rushed to his mother, hugged her and said, ``Hi, mommy
dearest. I've looked forward to this for several months.''
   Asked how it felt to be home, Timko replied, ``Pretty awesome.''
   Another passenger, John Charlton of Tampa, Fla., said, ``I feel
great, but my father's still in Baghdad.''
   In London, Timko told reporters members of the group had been
asked ``very nicely'' not to describe their treatment by Iraq. He
did not say who made the request.
   Timko had been serving as a summer intern at the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait.
   Hundreds of men from western countries have been detained in
Iraq, often at military installations as a deterrent against
attack.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Thursday that its
employees in the United Nations no longer must pay part of their
salaries to Moscow, which for decades reportedly used the hard
currency to fund espionage.
   The announcement by Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Nikiforov
was a concession to reality; Soviet U.N. workers rebelled against
the Soviet Mission's control this summer and many refused to turn
over their paychecks.
   A U.N. administrative tribunal ruled that most of their
contracts, which gave Moscow the right to require then to return
home in two to four years, were invalid. That freed the Soviet
employees to seek independent U.N. contracts.
   Soviet employees indicated the threat of being returned home was
used for years to force them to accept Soviet payment terms.
   The U.N. tribunal also invalidated many short-term contracts of
Chinese U.N. employees. It ruled that staffers with five years or
more experience could apply directly to the world body to renew
their contracts.
   For years, Chinese, Soviet and other Eastern European workers at
the United Nations have had to turn over their paychecks to their
countries' U.N. missions. The Soviets lost about 40 percent of the
value of their pay this way.
   Soviet employees said the Soviet Mission paid their rent and
gave them monthly allowances of $1,000 to $1,400, keeping the rest.
   Rossen Vassilev, a former Bulgarian U.N. employee who defected
in 1988, said Soviet bloc nations recycled the confiscated cash to
fund espionage in the West.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said in 1988 that
Moscow would let some Soviets apply for long-term U.N. contracts.
The Soviet Mission said only about 10 Soviet professionals have
accepted permanent contracts so far.
   But Nikiforov said all Soviets would be permitted to seek
long-term contracts starting Jan. 1.
   The Soviet Union has about 450 staffers in the Secretariat in
New York and overseas. About 500 other Soviets work in
U.N.-affiliated agencies in Geneva, Rome, Vienna, Paris, Nairobi,
Montreal and Washington. Almost all work on short-term contracts.

   A Soviet journalist dropped from sight
six days after a peace delegation he was with returned home, but
unlike the Cold War days, no one seemed bothered by the
disappearance, officials said Thursday.
   U.S. immigration officials said Maxim A. Kniazkov has not sought
asylum and probably has a visa good for six months. His host in
Kansas hasn't heard from him. No one knew Thursday where Kniazkov
might be.
   ``I've inquired as many different ways as I could,'' said Rick
Plumlee, who opened his Lawrence home to Kniazkov during his
weeklong visit to attend the Meeting for Peace.
   The program is a cultural exchange in which Soviet citizens
stayed with Kansas families and toured the state. Kniazkov, who
works for the Soviet news agency Tass, was among 250 Soviets at the
gathering in Lawrence that ended Oct. 19, the day his delegation
flew home without him.
   Georgi Grechko, who headed the Soviet delegation, said at the
time that Kniazkov could stay if he so desired. Grechko said he was
surprised Kniazkov's disappearance attracted media interest.
   ``This is a very old way of thinking - that this is a big
deal,'' he said.
   A Soviet expert at the University of Kansas, Gerald Mikkelson,
said Kniazkov's apparent decision to stay behind would have been
unheard of 10 years ago.
   ``I think the prevailing attitude now is, `So what if he wants
to stay in the United States, that's his business,''' Mikkelson
said. ``I'm not saying they don't care whether their people come
back or not, but if this guy is footloose, he just frees up a
little space for someone else to occupy.''

   A senior Israeli official on Thursday
departed for Ethiopia in hopes of easing the plight of thousands of
Ethiopian Jews waiting to immigrate to the Jewish state.
   ``I hope the picture I bring back from there can perhaps help us
find ways to help them,'' Deputy Science Minister Geula Cohen said
before departure at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv.
She belongs to a special Cabinet committee on immigration.
   Mrs. Cohen's trip came amid heightened efforts by Israel to
bring most of the 22,000 Ethiopian Jews in that country to Israel
and unite them with their families. Thousands of Jews left Ethiopia
for Israel in the last decade.
   Most Ethiopian Jews have been stranded in the capital of Addis
Ababa after gathering there from outlying villages to await
departure.
   Ethiopian activists in Israel said some of the refugees have
died from starvation and disease.
   On Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir promised
representatives of the 17,000 Ethiopian Jews in Israel that the
country was ``doing all it can for their brothers in Ethiopia.''
   ``We are in contact with the Ethiopian government to allow
greater emigration,'' Shamir added, according to a communique
published by his office Monday. He also promised to send doctors to
treat the refugees in Addis Ababa.
   About 8,000 Ethiopians came to Israel during the secret
``Operation Moses'' rescue mission in 1984-85. The effort came to
an abrupt halt when news of the air lift was leaked to the press.
   At the time, Ethiopia lacked diplomatic ties with Israel. But
ties were reestablished in October 1989, and Ethiopia's government
began permitting about 500 Jews a month to reach Israel. That
arrangement broke down in July without explanation.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is laying plans to send as many
as 100,000 more troops to Saudi Arabia, but the expanded buildup
does not signal a U.S. intent to attack Iraq, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said Thursday.
   CIA Director William Webster, meanwhile, suggested a growing
U.S. reluctance to let Iraqi President Saddam Hussein survive the
current crisis in power, even if he withdraws from Kuwait.
   Webster said the Persian Gulf region will not be secure unless
Saddam is removed from power or he is ``disassociated'' from his
chemical weapons and reported efforts to acquire nuclear arms.
   On Capitol Hill, there was concern over the administration's
course and worry that once Congress leaves town, Bush might feel
less constrained to follow a peaceful path.
   ``I am not convinced that this administration will do everything
in its power to avoid war,'' said Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb.,
expressing the same sentiments as many of his colleagues who have
supported the gulf deployment.
   Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor winner, said ``If
ever there was an avoidable war, it is this one.''
   The Pentagon's disclosure earlier this week that it was
considering adding troops to Operation Desert Shield, beyond the
240,000 already there or en route, raised questions about whether
the deployment was being tailored for an offensive.
   The Saudi ambassador, Pince Bandar Bin Sultan, said after a late
afternoon meeting with senior State Department officials, ``The
issue of peace or war is in the hands of Saddam Hussein.'' Hussein,
he said, ``is playing with the emotions of everybody with this game
with the hostages.''
   Asked why the United States was sending more troops, the
ambassador replied, ``It just means we will not take any chances.''
   Prince Bandar met with Robert Kimmitt, under secretary for
political affairs, and Morris Busby, head of the department's
counter-terrorism office. Asked if Saudi Arabia faced a new
terrorist threat, the ambassador declined to answer.
   Webster said in a breakfast speech the CIA had received
``encouraging reports'' of dissaffection in Iraq. He did not
elaborate on where this dissent could be found. Bandar said he had
``great respect'' for Iraq's armed forces and added, ``I can
understand why they have great discontent with their leader.'' He
declined further comment on intelligence topics.
   Cheney, speaking in a series of interviews with the television
networks ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN, said the Bush administration had
not set an upper limit on troop deployments to Saudi Arabia. He
said he wanted to have enough forces there ``to deal with any
contingency.''
   The defense secretary said his orders from Bush were to use
American forces to deter Saddam from invading Saudi Arabia, to
prepare to defend the Saudi kingdom in the event of an attack and
to enforce the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   ``We want to have the capability for the president to make the
decision to use other options should that become necessary in
response to a provocation, for example,'' Cheney said. He was
referring to a possible U.S. offensive action.
   At another point, he said, ``For a number of reasons I would
expect a continuing flow of forces to the gulf in the period
ahead.''
   Cheney did not provide details of the additional U.S.
deployments planned. When asked by an interviewer whether as many
as 100,000 more troops might be sent, Cheney said: ``It's
conceivable that we'll end up with that big an increase.''
   Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, later told reporters that
Cheney was not suggesting that a decision had been made on how many
extra troops to deploy.
   The need to expand Desert Shield - already the biggest U.S.
military operation since Vietnam - is based in part on increases in
Iraqi troop strength in occupied Kuwait since the first U.S.
deployments began in early August, Williams said.
   The Pentagon estimates that about 430,000 Iraqi troops are in
and around Kuwait now, compared with about 150,000 in August when
the American deployment plan was put together.
   Williams said the request for more troops came from Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander in chief of all U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf area. Schwarzkopf met earlier this week in Saudi
Arabia with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, to discuss possible additional troop deployments.
   Williams said that Powell had relayed his advice to Cheney in
recent days and that the two likely would discuss the situation in
more depth early next week.
   Williams indicated that Cheney was considering transferring as
many as 50,000 troops from Germany to Saudi Arabia, but that plans
were incomplete. He did not specify whether the forces from Europe
would rotate to Saudi Arabia as replacements for or additions to
the troops that have been there for several weeks.
   The spokesman sought to play down Cheney's comment that 100,000
more troops might be sent.
   ``I want to steer you away from the notion that there is some
piece of paper ... on how many additional forces to send to Saudi
Arabia that the secretary is waiting to act on,'' Williams said.
   The spokesman said no U.S.-based combat troops had been alerted
to prepare for deployment to Saudi Arabia beyond those originally
committed to Desert Shield. But he said 50,000 U.S. forces in
Europe know they will be leaving in coming months.
   ``Now they understand that they may go through Saudi Arabia on
the way home,'' Williams said.
   U.S. forces now in Saudi Arabia include four Army divisions,
three Marine Corps expeditionary brigades, an air defense artillery
brigade, a mechanized infantry brigade and an armored cavalry
regiment. Also in the gulf area are more than 500 U.S. aircraft and
55 ships.
   Also on Thursday, Congress made it more likely that combat
reserve units would be called to active duty for Desert Shield.
House and Senate negotiators added to the 1991 defense spending
bill an extension of the reserve duty period to 360 days from 180
days for ``combat arms only.''
   The Pentagon had said it wanted the extension before using any
combat reserves. The House passed the bill Thursday and the Senate
was expected to take it up Friday.

   Foreign envoys in Rwanda said Thursday
they saw no signs to support reports of a cease-fire in the
month-old fighting between the government and rebels.
   ``I have no evidence of a cease-fire,'' said a Western diplomat.
``I have not heard of it except from foreign news reports.''
   Another Western diplomat said he doubted a cease-fire would hold
between the rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front and President Juvenal
Habyarimana's government.
   ``A cease-fire would mean the rebels would stay where they
are,'' the diplomat said. ``That would mean giving the rebels part
of the country. I doubt Habyarimana would agree to that.''
   The diplomats were interviewed by telephone from Kenya's
capital, Nairobi, and requested anonymity.
   Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens told journalists Wednesday
in Nairobi that Rwanda's government had accepted an unconditional
cease-fire earlier in the day.
   State radio reported government troops killed 320 rebels and
themselves lost 10 soldiers in fighting Tuesday.
   The fighting is about 37 miles northeast of the capital of
Kigali, which the envoys said remained calm Wednesday.
   Eyskens proposed African nations provide a neutral force to
monitor a cease-fire. He said Belgium, which formerly ruled Rwanda
as a colony, would provide logistical and financial support.
   Esykens said he had learned of the halt in fighting by telephone
from Rwanda's foreign minister, Casimir Bizimungu. Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni announced Monday that the rebels had
accepted a cease-fire.
   The Belgians, who have been leading international efforts to
settle the conflict peacefully, were concluding a second meeting
with the region's leaders.
   Martens said Belgium would decide Friday whether to withdrew its
troops, sent soon after the rebels invaded Sept. 30 from Uganda.
   In Zaire, neighboring Rwanda, government sources said that at a
summit earlier this week the leaders of Zaire, Burundi, and Rwanda
had advocated the fromation of an African peacekeeping force to be
deployed as soon as a cease-fire took hold.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Stay in Washington Party Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay Thursday to
allow an all-black slate of candidates to appear on the Nov. 6
ballot, a move county officials said will throw election plans into
chaos.
   Harold Washington Party leaders delighted in the win. Cook
County officials said the court decision could cost taxpayers up to
$2 million.
   The order, less than two weeks before the general election, is
``a complete victory for us, a complete victory for the people,''
said Eugene Pincham, leader of the party named for the city's first
black mayor who died in 1987.
   County Clerk Stanley Kusper said of the stay: ``We're sitting in
here pulling out our collective hair.''
   Most ballots already have been printed, without the Washington
Party candidates.
   Kusper said elections officials made last-minute plans to give
voters a looseleaf booklet, much like an absentee ballot, including
the names of all candidates, including members of the Harold
Washington Party.
   Now, voters will get a separate list of candidates names and
will have to match the numbers on the booklet with numbers on a
punch card.
   The Supreme Court order let stand an Aug. 29 Cook County
electoral board decision that allowed Harold Washington Party
candidates to be listed on city and county ballots.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled Oct. 12 that Washington Party
candidates should not be allowed on the ballot because they lacked
sufficient nominating petitions.
   But the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling gives Harold Washington
Party attorneys 90 days from Oct. 12 to file formal appeals, well
beyond the Nov. 6 election date. The high court will decide later
whether to hear the case.
   Stu Piper, executive director of the Illinois Republican Party,
said Republccan candidates could benefit from the ruling if
traditionally Democratic black voters opt for Washington Party
candidates in local races.
   ``There's a lot of mad voters out there who were mad about not
being able to vote who are now going to vote,'' Piper said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four top Cuban military and intelligence officers
executed on drug charges actually were killed for plotting against
Fidel Castro, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The conspiracy against the Cuban president included Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa and many others at the top of the Cuban military and
the Interior Ministry, Juan Manuel Rodriguez Camejo, a Cuban major
who defected Sunday, told El Nuevo Herald.
   The newspaper is the Spanish-language companion newspaper to The
Miami Herald.
   Ochoa and three other officials were executed in July 1989 after
a televised tribunal in which prosecutors accused them of aiding
drug traffickers.
   ``Inside the (Cuban armed forces) the conspiracy reached very
high levels, and Ochoa took the secret to his grave,'' Rodriguez
said.
   Since the discovery of the conspiracy against Castro and the
subsequent executions, most intelligence officials have been
replaced, he said.
   ``The situation in the military is very tense,'' Rodriguez said.
``But our lives are controlled 24 hours a day, especially since the
trial.''
   Rodriguez said he traveled as an official in Cuban commercial
enterprises to cover his intelligence activities.
   He said he was active in infiltrating spy operations run out of
the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, which led in 1987 to a series
on state-run Cuban television called ``The CIA's War Against
Cuba.''
   Rodriguez said he decided to defect after becoming disenchanted
with Castro's handling of the economy and his failure to adapt to
the worldwide political changes of the mid-1980s. He defected in
Germany.
   Rodriguez is living in an undisclosed location in the United
States and talked to the newspaper by telephone, the newspaper
said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Refuses To Prohibit Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court refused
Thursday to prohibit a death sentence for a former winery worker
accused of killing seven people and trying to kill three others.
   Ramon Salcido, 29, is accused in the slayings, including six
family members, during a series of bloody attacks in California's
wine country last year.
   Salcido faces seven counts of murder and three counts of
attempted murder. The case went to the jury Wednesday and
deliberations continued Thursday.
   The Supreme Court refused a defense request to intervene in the
case and prohibit a death sentence. Jurors could recommend the
death penalty if they find Salcido guilty of multiple first-degree
murders.
   Salcido's lawyers had argued their client was removed from
Mexico by a subterfuge intended to evade the U.S.-Mexico
extradition treaty.
   That treaty lets Mexico, which has no death penalty for murder,
deny extradition if the fugitive could be sentenced to death in the
United States.
   In court papers, public defender Marteen Miller said Mexican
officials were deceived into releasing Salcido into U.S. custody
without formal extradition after he was arrested in Mexico four
days after the killings.
   ``The law enforcement agents of SonomaCounty sought to evade
the effect of these treaty provisions by intentionally misleading
the Mexican authorities into falsely believing that (Salcido) was
an American citizen and expelling him,'' Miller wrote.
   Those arguments were rejected earlier by Superior Court Judge
Reginald Littrell, who is presiding over Salcido's trial in San
Mateo County.
   The proceedings were moved from Sonoma County because of heavy
pre-trial publicity.
   Salcido is accused of shooting his wife, Angela, 24, and cutting
the throats of their three young daughters, two of whom died, in
April 1989.
   He also is accused of stabbing to death his mother-in-law,
Marian Richards, 47, killing her two daughters and fatally shooting
his co-worker Tracey Toovey, 35.
   He faces three counts of attempted murder for attacks on his
surviving daughter, another co-worker, Kenneth Butti, and Butti's
wife, Terri.

   Two men cited for holding hands in a parked
car were cleared by a judge, but the American Civil Liberties Union
said Thursday it is appalled that the incident even occurred.
   ``It's entirely offensive. It would be offensive to any
civilized person that they're (police) doing this,'' said Jim
Rogers, ACLU coordinator for southwestern Ohio.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge Joseph Luebbers heard legal
argument and testimony Wednesday before dismissing the charges
against Commedore C. Canyon, 29, of Cincinnati and John K. Harden,
28, of Ludlow, Ky.
   ``I see this as a direct violation of freedom of association,
for two individuals not to be able to sit and talk,'' Rogers said.
``If these two gentlemen hadn't had the nerve to resist this
prosecution, this kind of harassment might have continued to take
place.''
   ``I'm just glad it's over, because we didn't do anything
wrong,'' Canyon said Wednesday.
   ``I'm pleased that justice was served, because we didn't do
anything wrong,'' Harden said Thursday.
   Defense lawyer Catherine Adams argued that the charge -
disorderly conduct for creating a physically offensive condition -
was unconstitutional. She said it fails to specify what sort of
conduct society considers acceptable or illegal.
   ``What is a physically offensive condition? Who knows what that
means?'' Ms. Adams asked. ``That doesn't put anybody on notice as
to what that means. There are all sorts of things that are
offensive, from picking your nose to God knows what.''
   Police officer Marty Polk found the men holding hands in a
parked car Sept. 27 in Eden Park.
   The men said they had known each other six years and that Canyon
was consoling Harden over a death in his family when they were
cited. The two are homosexuals, but are not romantically involved,
said lawyer Scott Knox, an associate of Ms. Adams.
   Polk testified that the fact both were men did not make the act
offensive - he said the situation would have been as offensive had
it involved a man and a woman.
   Ms. Adams said the two men were cited three days after activists
protested at the Hamilton County Courthouse as the Contemporary
Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie went on trial on charges of
displaying obscene photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. At issue
were seven photos showing sexually graphic acts involving men and
two children with their genitals exposed.
   Barrie and the center were acquitted of all charges.
   Mapplethorpe, 42, who was a homosexual, died in 1989 of AIDS.
The activists who protested Sept. 24 accused police and prosecutors
of harassing homosexuals.
   ``I really believe that this (citations) happened because of the
atmosphere generated by the Mapplethorpe case and the Mapplethorpe
demonstration,'' Ms. Adams said.
   Ed Ammann, assistant police chief, denied the allegation
Thursday, saying police enforce laws, not harass homosexuals.
   ``I don't think it was a harassment kind of thing,'' Ammann
said. ``The officer believed he had a disorderly conduct case, so
he placed the charges. ... There is no attempt to increase
enforcement in the area of homosexuals.''
   Ms. Adams said the law prohibiting disorderly conduct for
creating a physically offensive condition had been in effect since
Jan. 1, 1974. But she said her research turned up no published case
in Ohio in which the law had been the basis for a prosecution. The
maximum penalty for conviction is a $116 fine.
   Rogers said the ACLU does not plan to file a protest, but will
monitor to see if there is evidence of harassment against the gay
community.
   ``It's an enforcement of the statute in a definitely
unconstitutional manner,'' Rogers said.
   ``We all have a right of association ... two people, man and
woman, woman and woman, man and man, are allowed to sit and comfort
each other,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Actress Angela Lansbury has come under fire
for appearing in political advertisements opposing term limits for
state officials, with supporters of the initiatives calling the
ads, ``Distortions, She Wrote.''
   The star of CBS-TV's ``Murder, She Wrote'' did not know that the
ads were paid for by state legislators, her son said. In addition,
she is unfamiliar with other provisions of the two propositions.
   Commercials featuring the actress aired Tuesday. She did the ads
at the request of an unidentified friend, said David Shaw, the
actress' son and agent.
   ``She doesn't really read newspapers,'' Shaw said.
   Miss Lansbury does feel strongly that politicians' terms should
not be limited and has not asked that the ads be pulled, Shaw said.
``She's not backing out of what she said,'' Shaw said.
   KCBS-TV in Los Angeles pulled the ad Thursday until the dispute
over whether to include mention in the ad of state legislators who
helped pay for it was resolved, station officials said.
   Proponents of Proposition 140 said the commercials incorrectly
suggest that the measure would require public funding of campaigns.

<HEAD>Former Chicagoan Gives Up U.S. Citizenship</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP)- A former Chicago man who was admitted
participating in an infamous World War II death march when he was a
Nazi concentration camp guard has renounced his U.S. citizenship,
the Justice Department said Thursday.
   Martin Zultner renounced his American citizenship at the U.S.
Consulate in Salsburg, Austria, on Aug. 16 and the State Department
accepted the renunciation this week, the Justice Department said.
   Zultner, who has lived in Austria since 1975, renounced his
citizenship two weeks after the Justice Department initiated
proceedings in U.S. District Court in Washington to strip him of
it.
   The government has stripped 33 former Nazis of U.S. citizenship
and deported 29 from this country since the Justice Department set
up its Nazi-hunting unit in 1979, the department said.
   Zultner confessed under oath during a May 1990 interview with a
Justice Department investigator to being a Waffen-SS guard at the
Schwechat, Floridsdorf, and Modling subcamps of the Mauthausen
concentration camp in Austria, the department said.
   Zultner also admitted that he had lied about his Nazi past when
he immigrated to this country after the war, said Neal Sher, who
heads the Office of Special Investigations.
   ``Zultner confessed to taking part in the infamous death march
from Modling to Mauthausen in April 1945, during the course of
which hundreds of prisoners were shot to death,'' Sher said in a
statement.
   The department said Zultner denied allegations of former SS
comrades that he interrogated camp inmates, was present when they
were whipped and that his office issued orders to kill prisoners by
lethal heart injections.
   But Zultner admitted to interviewers that he was an
administrative aide to the SS guard supervisor and the commandant
at the concentration camps and that he issued rifles to camp
guards.

   A Vietnam veteran who said he was a victim
of war stress was convicted Thursday for a second time of the 1981
rape-kidnap of a woman who disclosed her identity in frustration
over years of delay.
   ``God, yea!'' said victim Sue Kremelberg, 35, her fists raised
in the air, after the verdicts were read. She and her family then
hugged in the courtroom.
   Robert Percy, 39, was accused of raping Kremelberg in 1981 while
out on bail after raping an Essex attorney, Susan Sweetser, just
weeks earlier.
   In both cases Percy was convicted of rape. In his appeals of
both cases, the Vermont Supreme Court overturned the convictions on
procedural errors and sent them back for retrial.
   The Sweetser rape led to a second conviction in 1988 and last
month the high court upheld the verdict.
   For years, Kremelberg and Sweetser have had to return again and
again to court to recite the stories of their rapes. Outrage over
those experiences prompted them to go public with their cases this
summer.
   They shed the anonymity customarily shrouding rape victims
hoping to provoke changes in a complex and sluggish judicial system
they say favors defendants.
   Percy, who blamed his crime on his stressful legacy from combat
in the Vietnam War, can still appeal this verdict to the Vermont
Supreme Court.
   His lawyer didn't say whether an appeal would be made.
   Percy's conviction Thursday of sexual assault, kidnapping, armed
robbery and committing a felony while carrying a concealed weapon
will add to his current sentence of 18 to 20 years for raping
Sweetser. He was eligible for parole in 1994.
   Sentencing in the Kremelberg case is expected within the next
few months. Sweetser called Thursday's verdict gratifying. ``I'm
both pleased and relieved,'' she said after learning of the
verdict. ``I'm happy for all the women of Vermont.''
   State Attorney General Jeffrey Amestoy predicted the women's
public complaints would yield improvements in the state's justice
system. He also intends to propose changes to the Legislature in
January.
   The Kemelberg and Sweetser cases are ``significant beyond the
particular cases because they are symbolic of some problems in
Vermont's criminal justice system,'' Amestoy said. ``These cases
have put a face on the problem.''
   ``First and foremost, we need an amendment to Vermont's
constitution to clearly establish the authority of Vermont judges
to deny bail when the defendant poses a danger to the public,'' he
said.
   He also will push for a way to speed up the Vermont Supreme
Court's review of appeals and will propose legislation mandating a
minimum 15 years to life in prison for anyone convicted of three
violent felonies.
   Percy did not admit to raping either woman, but his lawyers did
not deny the rapes occured, arguing that Percy was insane at the
time because he suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Percy's lawyer, James Dumont, said in closing arguments
Wednesday that Percy was ``wounded in the brain'' by his Vietnam
experience.
   But prosecutor Phillip Cykon countered that Percy was in control
of his actions.
   ``The defendant was acting in a way that was his continuing
anti-social behavior. They were the actions of a defendant who was
in control,'' Cykon said.
   Kremelberg's nine-hour ordeal the night of Jan. 16, 1981, began
when she stopped at a gasoline station where Percy was working.
   Percy told her to back her car to the air pump because her left
tire looked low. There Percy jumped into the car and forced
Kremelberg at gunpoint to drive away. He tied her up and raped her
twice.

   Descendants of the Indians killed and hurt in
the Wounded Knee massacre 100 years ago got their long-awaited
apology from the U.S. government Thursday.
   The House gave final congressional approval to a resolution
expressing the government's ``deep regret'' for the event that
marked the end of the Indian wars. The Senate approved the measure
last week.
   Depending on the historical account, some 150 to 400 Sioux
Indians were killed by the 7th Cavalry on Dec. 29, 1890 on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.
   The resolution does not provide any reparations to the
descendants or declare the remote site a national monument, as the
Wounded Knee Survivors Association had requested.
   ``No money is spent by this measure,'' said Rep. Tim Johnson,
D-S.D., who called the apology a ``long overdue measure.''
   The resolution passed by voice vote.
   The resolution said Congress ``acknowledges the historical
significance of this event as the last armed conflict of the Indian
wars period ... and hereby expresses its deep regret on behalf of
the United States to the descendants of the victims and survivors
and their respective tribal communities.''
   Te South Dakota congressional delegation hopes to get funds
next year for the monument designation and reparations for
descendants of the victims. The site was made a national landmark
25 years ago.
   The descendants want compensation for thousands of dollars in
property that was taken from the victims.
   Indian and government historians have been at odds over the past
century on the circumstances surrounding Wounded Knee and the toll
of dead and injured.
   According to the resolution, 350 to 375 Indian men, women and
children of Chief Big Foot's band of Minneconjou Sioux were killed
at Wounded Knee.
   The descendants group told a Senate committee last month that
426 Indians were killed when they were attacked while in custody of
drunken soldiers.
   The official position of the Interior Department, parent agency
of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, is that fewer than 200 people were
killed or wounded. The firing began when an Indian fired his gun as
soldiers tried to disarm him, the department says.

   The pastor of a rural church may have
broken state laws by banishing a blind associate to the back of the
church with his guide dog and posting ``beware of the dog'' signs,
an official said Thursday.
   Associate pastor Le Roy Singleton used to sit in the pulpit of
Mount Zion AME Church during services.
   But when Singleton was declared legally blind and got a guide
dog last month, the Rev. Ellsworth L. Coleman barred Singleton from
the church. Singleton, 62, was allowed to attend services Sunday,
but he was forced to sit in a back pew with his dog.
   ``It appears there may well be a problem,'' said Fred Silverman,
Delaware's chief deputy attorney general. ``Our office would be
glad to speak with him. The Human Relations Commission would be
happy to speak with him.''
   The church has large, red ``beware of the dog signs'' on each
door, said Earlene A. Hughes, president of the Delaware branch of
the National Federation of the Blind.
   Hughes said state law allows guide dogs in public places with
their masters.
   ``Rev. Coleman told me I was choosing a dog over God,''
Singleton said. ``I told him the dog was my eyes and God wouldn't
see it that way.''
   Coleman has an unpublished home telephone number and calls to
the church, about 20 miles south of Dover, went unanswered
Thursday.
   A member of the congregation said Coleman cited a biblical
passage to support his contention that the dog should not be
allowed to sit at the front of the church.
   The passage from Deuteronomy 23:18 says: ``Thou shalt not bring
the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the
Lord thy God for any vow: for even both these are abominations unto
the Lord thy God.''
   The guide dog, Digby, sat quietly through Sunday's services,
Singleton said.
   ``There was singing, clapping and praising, and the dog did not
interrupt the services,'' he said. ``He was a perfect gentleman.''

<TEXT>
   Two months after a Saudi Arabian prince
set up camp near Harvard Square - complete with a satellite dish
and an entourage of 65 at a posh hotel - residents say the royals
are wearing out their welcome.
   In the latest of several incidents, North Cambridge residents
complained security forces with the Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz's
entourage ejected local children from a park during royal family
visits.
   They also claimed the Saudis drove stretch limousines across
newly seeded athletic fields.
   Prince Turki, a brother of Saudi Arabia's king and the country's
former deputy defense minister, arrived at Cambridge's Charles
Square Hotel in early August for a visit to Harvard University.
   But the prince says he has stayed to monitor U.S. response to
the crisis in the Middle East.
   Cambridge City Councilor Edward Cyr said he will ask the council
to respond to the incident at the park.
   ``Once they drove their limousines into the park and almost ran
people down, then went up on the athletic field,'' Cyr told The
Boston Globe.
   Cyr said Wednesday he will ask the council to issue a formal
reminder to the prince's group that ``nobody will be allowed to
essentially usurp a public facility for their exclusive use.''
   Mayor Alice K. Wolf said she has fielded complaints from
residents that the prince's limousines have made it harder to park
in an already congested part of the city.
   Earlier this month, Harvard University police reduced its
participation in the 24-hour guard protecting Prince Turki.
   ``We don't want to abandon the family, but with the advent of
the school semester, we've been trying to phase it out,'' said
Harvard Police Chief Paul E. Johnson. ``Hopefully, he's going to be
leaving shortly.''
   Even Prince Turki's attempts at charity have generated sour
publicity.
   University officials announced last weekend that the prince had
endowed a Harvard Medical School professorship in immunology. The
prince's father-in-law has been treated in Boston by a
Harvard-affiliated physician following a kidney transplant.
   But the student-run Harvard Crimson newspaper said in an
editorial that university president Derek C. Bok was ``selling his
soul to the devil for a million-dollar professorship.''
   The Crimson referred to allegations from 10 female servants of
the prince who claimed 10 years ago they were being held as slaves.
   The Crimson also cited a 1989 incident in London when two German
nursemaids hired to care for the prince's three children dropped
notes from a sixth-story hotel window saying they were being held
hostage.
   Two Crimson photographers complained last month of being
physically threatened by royal bodyguards.
   No charges were filed in any of the incidents.
   But at the Charles Hotel, where the prince has 40 rooms, hotel
spokeswoman Martha Sullivan said the Saudis ``have been model
guests. I can tell you, honestly, it's been wonderful.''

<TEXT>
   A municipal judge candidate is facing
strong opposition, not just from his opponent but also from am
angry son born out of wedlock 34 years ago.
   Leo R. Villa, 62, a part-time court commissioner, is running
against trial lawyer David W. Perkins for the judgeship.
   But Villa's son, Richard, also is opposing his father's
candidacy, saying a bad father will make a bad judge.
   ``Leo R. Villa's son says vote no on Villa,'' read more than 200
campaign signs that Richard Villa has plastered around this Los
Angeles suburb.
   He said he's angry because his father has seen him only twice
and barely acknowledges his existence.
   ``How can someone who lacks such morals and compassion toward me
judge others?'' said the younger Villa, a computer book salesman.
``After thinking about it a lot, I decided to go public.''
   Richard Villa was born to Valma E. Vose in Orange in 1956. Ms.
Vose said Leo Villa, then 27, ended their relationship shortly
after he found out she was pregnant.
   In 1958, a judge declared Villa was Richard Villa's father and
ordered him to pay $60 a month child support. In 1975, those
payments were dropped to $40 after Leo Villa asked to stop payments
altogether.
   The elder Villa would not comment on Richard Villa's campaign.
The elder Villa's wife, Jennie, said he does not plan to stop his
son.
   Leo Villa's brother, Robert, said his brother met his legal
obligations by paying child support until Richard Villa turned 21.
   ``It really has nothing to do with whether he's qualified as a
judge or not,'' Robert Villa said. ``If he didn't make the child
support payments, then fine. But he paid.''

<TEXT>
   A couple was arraigned Thursday on
charges they kept their malnourished 12-year-old daughter captive
in a filthy, bug-infested closet.
   Joseph Sauceda, 33, and his wife, Sandra, 31, each were charged
with felony endangerment with great bodily injury. Sauceda also was
charged with felony child abuse.
   Municipal Judge W. Robert Fawk accepted innocent pleas from the
two and set a Nov. 6 preliminary hearing. Both remained in jail in
lieu of $50,000 bail each.
   Sauceda faces more than 10 years in state prison if convicted on
both counts, prosecutor Patrick Christianson said. His wife faces a
maximum of nine years in prison.
   The Saucedas' daughter was found Monday night in a
4-foot-by-5-foot closet littered with human waste and fast-food
wrappers and crawling with cockroaches, police said.
   Police checked on the girls' condition after receiving a tip
from a relative, said police spokeswoman Jenifer Kauffman.
   Officers said the child, whose name was not released, was lying
in her own feces and wore an oversized, urine-stained sweatsuit.
She was malnourished and displayed bruises from apparent beatings.
   The girl and her six brothers and sisters, ages 2 months to 15
years, were placed in foster homes. There was no evidence the
others were abused.
   During a Tuesday jailhouse interview, Sauceda denied abusing the
child.
   San Bernardino police chipped in $500 to start a trust fund to
buy the girl clothes and toys.

<TEXT>
   Protesting taxi drivers blocked bridges
in this capital city Thursday and others lined up for miles to fill
up their tanks after officials announced gasoline price hikes of up
to 70 percent.
   The government said it is increasing the prices, beginning
Friday, because of a shortfall in Soviet oil supplies. The higher
prices also reflect the loss of imports from Iraq under the
U.N.-ordered embargo for its invasion of Kuwait.
   Prices are to go up by 65 to 70 percent. Currently, the highest
grade of gasoline costs about $2.30 a gallon. With the price
increase, it will cost about $4 a gallon, a government spokesman
said.
   Hundreds of private taxis joined the protests in Budapest and
the eastern city of Debrecen, the state MTI news agency reported.
   Taxi drivers, angry over the new prices, barricaded bridges that
link the Buda and Pest sides of the capital spanning the Danube
River, the news agency said.
   The taxi protest on the bridges halted traffic from one part of
town to the other. Many Hungarians live on one side of the Danube,
which cuts through the capital, and work on the other.
   Other drivers lined up for several miles to fill their tanks
before the new prices come into effect, snarling traffic in the
capital.
   About 600 private taxi drivers gathered late Thursday in front
of Parliament. They demanded that the new prices be revoked, saying
the increases threaten their livelihood, MTI said.
   Transport Minister Csaba Siklos, who came out of a Cabinet
session to talk to the protesters, said the government could not
revoke the decision because it lacks any reserves to cover the
current price of crude oil, MTI reported.
   Hungary has so far put off an increase in gasoline prices.
Czechoslovakia and other East European countries have raised prices
the past month because of the shortfalls in Soviet oil.
   The problem has been compounded by the Persian Gulf crisis. Many
East European countries had barter contracts with Iraq, but Baghdad
cannot deliver that oil under the embargo for its Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   The last price increase in Hungary was in mid-July, when
gasoline prices rose by about 20 percent.
   Because of the reduced deliveries of Soviet oil, Hungary has had
to buy oil on the world market, spending scarce hard currency.
   Mrs. Katalin Kardos, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce, told reporters Thursday that the Soviets are
charging Hungary $17 a barrel but shipped only about 700,000 tons
in the last quarter.
   She said Hungary needed to buy another 700,000 or 800,000 tons
at world-market prices for the same period.
   The Soviet Union, for years the main supplier of subsidized oil
to Hungary and its East Eropean neighbors, has been unable to
fulfill quotas. It will begin demanding convertible currency for
the oil starting next year.

   ``I think it looks like the Virgin Mary all dressed up like she

<HEAD>Colonel Denies Allegation He Knew of Threats Against Jesuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Salvadoran colonel on
Thursday denied allegations by a U.S. military adviser that he knew
about threats against six Jesuit priests 10 days before they were
massacred by an army death squad.
   Col. Carlos Aviles called U.S. Army Maj. Eric Buckland ``crazy''
for making the accusation.
   The allegation is contained in an affidavit Buckland gave the
FBI in January. U.S. officials waited until this week to turn it
over to the Salvadoran judge investigating the massacre.
   ``This new information that we should have had 10 months ago
really complicates our work,'' said one court source. He said it
would delay the prosecution of Col. Guillermo Benavides and seven
other soldiers charged with the murders.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., revealed the existence of the
affidavit last week. He also said Buckland later recanted this
testimony.
   Moakley, who heads a congressional commission following the
Jesuit investigation, blamed U.S. Embassy officials in El Salvador
for withholding the affidavit alleging prior knowlege by the high
command.
   ``In withholding this information, the U.S. Embassy has acted in
a dirty way. If they hide something, it is for a reason,'' said
Father Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for Central
America.
   Embassy spokeswoman Pamela Corey-Archer said the State
Department has ordered all embassy officials to refuse comment on
the affidavit.
   It was other testimony by Buckland - that Aviles had told him
Benavides ordered the killings - that broke the case and led to the
arrests of Benavides and the other soldiers.
   At the time of the slayings, Buckland was stationed in El
Salvador as an adviser to a unit headed by Aviles.
   Court sources said the new affidavit says Col. Rene Emilio
Ponce, then chief of staff and now defense minister, sent Aviles to
try to calm down Benavides in early November.
   Buckland's affidavit says Ponce was worried because Benavides,
then head of the Military College, had been telling other officers
he was going to harm the Jesuits. Buckland said he went to the
Military College with Aviles, but was not present when the two
officers spoke.
   ``It is totally false,'' Aviles said in a telephone interview.
``The only explanation for these statements is that Buckland is
completely unstable emotionally.''
   ``He is crazy,'' Aviles said. He claimed he was not even in the
country in early November. He said he was in New Orleans between
Oct. 31 and Nov. 14.
   Ponce's office said the defense minister was not available for
comment.
   The priest-professors wer among Central America's leading
intellectuals. They advocated a negotiated settlement to the
conflict, and social change in El Salvador, and for this reason
many right-wingers hated them.
   On Nov. 16, army troops roused them from their beds at Central
American University before dawn, made them lie face-down in the
grass behind their campus residence and shot them to death,
according to soldiers' confessions.
   The troops also murdered the Jesuits' housekeeper and her
teenage daughter to eliminate witnesses.
   The court source said the submission of Buckland's affidavit
will delay the case. He said it may not go to trial until next
year.

<TEXT>
   Authorities charged the former chief of the
National Police on Thursday with plotting to overthrow the
government of President Guillermo Endara.
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz, in a letter to the chief of the
Technical Judicial Police, Leslie Loaiza, said former Col. Eduardo
Herrera was being charged with threatening state security.
   Herrera led the reorganization of Panama's military in the wake
of the Dec. 20, 1989, U.S. invasion that overthrew former strongman
Manuel Noriega. But Endara retired him in August, and the
government now says Herrera is linked to a group that opposes U.S.
intervention in Panama.
   Herrera was detained Wednesday upon returning from a private
visit to Peru. If convicted he could face up to 20 years in prison,
although a sentence of such a length would be unlikely.
   Herrera has denied the allegations. His attorney, Rafael
Rodriguez, told reporters that U.S. citizens had offered bribes in
exchange for testimony implicating Herrera.
   The government announced last week that Herrera had ordered
members of the National Police to carry out bombings and attempt to
seize army barracks.
   The government said he was also linked to underground 20th of
December Movement, which takes its name, in protest, from the date
of the U.S. invasion of Panama last year. The government this week
said it had uncovered two training camps for the guerrilla group,
which it said had about 225 members.

   A train of 30 to 40 horses laden with
4,391 pounds of cocaine were seized by Border Patrol agents after a
brief exchange of gunfire with smugglers, authorities said
Thursday.
   The Border Patrol estimated the street-sale value of the cocaine
seized Wednesday night at $200 million.
   The agency said in a statement from Tucson that the seizure was
a ``nationwide Border Patrol record.'' The statement did not say
what the previous record was.
   Border Patrol agents in Naco confiscated about 3,200 pounds of
cocaine in April. That seizure's street-sale value was estimated at
$150 million.
   Ron Dowdy, chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, said a
dozen riders leading the train of horses opened fire on approaching
agents about a half-mile west of a border crossing for commercial
trucks on the outskirts of Nogales.
   No agents were wounded in the exchange of gunfire, and the
riders dismounted and fled on foot, Dowdy said.
   The cocaine was in packages of about 2.2 pounds each, which were
in burlap bags of 90 to 100 pounds each, two to a horse, Dowdy
said.
   Dowdy said the horses were confiscated and placed in quarantine.

<HEAD>63 Dead in Indian Riots Over Religious Dispute</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police opened fire Thursday on
protesters in Calcutta during a Hindu-Moslem dispute that has
jeopardized the governing coalition and left at least 63 people
dead in two days of nationwide riots.
   The violence flared Wednesday during a nationwide strike called
by the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu fundamentalist group. The
party rocked the government Tuesday by withdrawing its support,
depriving Prime Minister V.P. Singh of a parliamentary majority and
forcing a vote of confidence in two weeks.
   The Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said
Thursday its 195 members in the 522-seat Parliament will vote
against Singh. It accused him of mishandling the religious dispute.
   Congress is the largest opposition group, and its announcement
appeared to cripple Singh's hope of winning the confidence vote.
   The bitter struggle revolves around a plan by Hindu
fundamentalists to build a temple on the site of a 16th-century
Moslem mosque. The Bharatiya Janata Party supports the plan, and
the government has vowed to stop it until the matter is heard in
court.
   Police opened fire in Calcutta on Thursday to quell mobs,
killing four people and injuring 10, the United News of India news
agency reported.
   Clashes also were reported for a second day in the western state
of Rajasthan, where five people were killed, reports said.
   Press Trust of India, compiling police reports from four states,
said 54 people wer  killed Wednesday during the strike.
   Fighting in the dispute has left at least 140 people dead this
month.
   The defection of the right-wing party, with 86 seats, left
Singh's centrist National Front and allied Left Front with just 198
assured votes. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress Party
hold a majority of votes between them.
   Congress Party spokesman Vithal N. Gadgil said his group was
willing to support any leader, besides Singh, chosen by the
governing National Front coalition. If the coalition can't come up
with an alternative, the Congress would stake a claim to form the
government, the spokesman said.
   Most analysts say elections are likely next year, regardless of
the immediate outcome.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew its support for Singh's
minority government after the arrest Tuesday of its leader, Lal
Krishna Advani, during a cross-country crusade to replace the
mosque with a Hindu temple.
   Hindus believe the mosque at the site in Ayodhya, 300 miles
southeast of New Delhi, stands on the birthplace of the god Rama.
They say it is as important to them as Mecca in Saudi Arabia is to
Moslems.

   A new name briefly emerged in the marital
melodrama of Donald and Ivana Trump: prisoner Vladimar Zatko, Ph.D.
   Zatko filed a complaint Monday in U.S. District Court, claiming
he is Mrs. Trump's brother and suing her debt-strapped husband for
$275 million.
   Zatko, an inmate at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City,
Calif., claimed he suffered extreme emotional distress after Trump
publicly humiliated Mrs. Trump by allegedly having an extra-marital
relationship with Marla Maples.
   U.S. District Court Judge Alfred J. Lechner dismissed the suit
as frivolous the same day it was filed.
   ``Ivana's an only child,'' said John Scanlon, a spokesman for
Mrs. Trump.
   Prison spokesman Al Deines said records do not show that Zatko
has a Ph.D. or that he is related to Mrs. Trump. They do show he
has a history of threatening public figures and filing lawsuits
against them, said Deines.
   Zatko was moved to Pelican Bay because of his threats against
public figures, he said.
   Zatko has been sentenced to life on two separate occasions - in
1971 for robbery and grand theft and in 1976 for assaulting another
inmate.

<TEXT>
   The Parliament has approved freedom of
the press and speech measures as well as majority elections in this
East African country shedding the vestiges of Marxist rule, the
national news agency reported Thursday.
   In debate on a new constitution, the Parliament, known as the
People's Assembly, previously approved an article to allow
opposition parties. The move would end 15 years of one-party rule.
   All the changes would take effect when Parliament approves the
entire new constitution. Article-by-article debate was expected to
continue several more days.
   The Central Committee of the ruling FRELIMO party proposed the
new constitution. Support from the FRELIMO-dominated Parliament is
expected.
   President Joachim Chissano said in July he wanted a multiparty
system in place for parliamentary and presidential elections
scheduled for next year. He reviously had opposed such a system,
saying it would encourage tribalism and waste the country's scarce
resources.
   Chissano also has promised to end a 13-year-old civil war with
the Mozambique National Resistance that has claimed 600,000 lives
and left about half the country's 15 million people in need of
donated food.
   Multiparty elections is a key rebel demand for ending the
fighting.
   The Parliament voted unanimously Thursday for a majority-vote
election system instead of a proportional system, AIM reported.
   The agency said the system would be a winner-take-all format
instead of a proportional system in which parties receive the same
percentage of parliamentary seats as popular votes received.
   Chissano told the assembly a majority vote system would make
``the process of governing easier, since minority parties were
likely to have less weight in parliament,'' AIM reported.
   In presidential elections, a candidate would be required to gain
at least half the votes to win. If no candidate gets half, a runoff
would be held between the top two finishers.
   There have been no presidential elections and FRELIMO has been
the sole legal political party since this southeast African nation
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The FRELIMO party was Marxist, but it has undergone reforms in
recent years and officially dropped its Marxist label last year.
   The Parliament also approved articles guaranteeing all citizens
``the right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, as
well as the right to information,'' AIM reported.
   The articles give reporters access to sources and protects their
independence, and they provide the right to set up newspapers and
other publications. However, radio and television will remain
government-controlled.

   The daughter of slain Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat on Thursday called Saddam Hussein ``the great Satan'' and
said world leaders must find a peaceful solution to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Camelia Sadat, who teaches in the Boston area and is earning a
doctorate, was here to address The Women's National Republican Club
on peace initiatives in the gulf.
   ``I have lived wars,'' said Ms. Sadat, recalling Middle East
conflicts. ``I was the wife of an officer. I was the daughter of an
officer. My cousins were officers. My brother-in-law was an
officer. The Sadat family was an army by itself.''
   The destruction and suffering of war and the lives of 240,000
troops in the gulf are reason enough to pursue peace there, she
said in an interviw before her speech.
   ``The deployment of military was mainly to deter wars and to
help bring peace. So let's keep it this way. Let's keep the idea
that we started with. Let's not bar the peaceful solution,'' she
said.
   ``I know very, very well that Saddam Hussein's success in Kuwait
would have given him an appetite (for) all of the countries around.
   ``I think he's Satan. He's the great Satan. Because I tell you,
this man had worked on the Iraqi people and has split them. He
terrorized them and split them. He terrorized the Arab world and
split them by ... keeping Kuwait. He terrorized the Moslem world
and split them.''
   Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by commandos while he was
reviewing a military parade in Cairo.

<TEXT>
   A man who killed and mutilated his
girlfriend and fed her body parts to his dogs was sentenced
Thursday to 12 to 17 years in prison.
   Jeffrey L. Van Patten, 33, was given the maximum sentence by
Judge Harvey W. Moes, who called the case ``suitable for the
National Enquirer.''
   ``I would have to look far to find something as serious as his
conduct,'' Moes said.
   Van Patten pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, mutilation
of a corpse and felony firearms charges in the July 10 shooting
death of his live-in girlfriend, Kimberly A. Knight, 18.
   In his confession, Van Patten said Knight attacked him with two
butcher knives so he shot her and then panicked. He shot her at
least twice, burned her body, dismembered it with a chainsaw and
fed it to his four dogs.
   Officials said the self-defense motive and a lack of witnesses
and evidence caused them to drop a murder charge in exchange for a
manslaughter plea.
   Prosecutor Michael Smith has said results of a polygraph test
indicate Van Patten may have been telling the truth about the knife
attack.
   Defense attorney Thomas O'Brien, saying Knight had a violent
past, argued for probation on the manslaughter charge and blamed
the mutilation on panic.
   Smith argued for the maximum sentence, saying Van Patten went
far beyond self defense. For six weeks after her disappearance, Van
Patten claimed Knight ran away after an argument.
   ``He has shown no remorse,'' Smith said. ``He led the family and
law enforcement officials on a wild goose chase.''
   Speaking softly to the judge, Van Patten said he was scared for
his life the night he killed Knight.
   ``I really wish I wouldn't have done it,'' Van Patten said. ``I
know now that I did wrong.''

murdering two men - including one he videotaped - and of conspiring
to kill his wife.
   Prosecutors charged that Kosta Fotopoulos, a Daytona Beach
businessman, enlisted the two men in a failed plot to kill his
wife, Lisa, so he could collect insurance.
   Fotopoulos' one-time lover and employee, Deidre Hunt, 21, was
convicted earlier in the same killings and has been sentenced to
die in Florida's lectric chair.
   Jurors will make a sentencing recommendation to Circuit Judge S.
James Foxman, who will decide whether Fotopoulos will get life in
prison or death. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death
penalty. The jury was to begin the sentencing phase of the trial
Monday.
   Fotopoulos, 31, was convicted of the videotaped slaying of Mark
Kevin Ramsey, 19, and the shooting of Bryan Chase, 18, both in the
fall of 1989.
   Prosescutors said Fotopoulos forced Ms. Hunt to kill Ramsey to
ensure her cooperation in his plan to kill his wife. Fotopoulos
then killed Chase when he flubbed his murder-for-hire assignment to
kill Fotopoulos' wife and make it look like a burglary.
   Mrs. Fotopoulos survived the Nov. 4, 1989, shooting and
testified that her husband wanted her dead for her money after she
threatened to divorce him over his affair with Ms. Hunt.
   Fotopoulos took the stand in his own defense, claiming
prosecutors coerced Ms. Hunt to testify against him. Fotopoulos'
attorney, Carmen Corrente, said his client was framed by Ms. Hunt
and her friends.

<HEAD>Ex-Officials of State-Controlled Greek Companies to Stand Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court Thursday ordered 11
former officials of state-controlled companies to stand trial for
bribery and accepting proceeds of a crime.
   The charges revolve around money deposited in the Bank of Crete,
which is also at the hub of the legal case against former Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou. He was indicted last year.
   Among those facing the latest charges are Alexandros Akrivakis,
former board chairman of Olympic Airways; Theofanis Tombras,
ex-director general of the Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization; and Panagiotis Vournas, former head of the Greek Post
Office.
   The 11 men were appointed by the former Socialist administration
of Papandreou, who governed from 1981-89. The three-member appeals
court did not set a trial date for the 11.
   Akrivakis is a deputy of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, now
the major political opposition party. In order to put him on trial,
Parliament must decide whether to lift his parliamentary immunity.
   The charges are related to money deposited by the
state-controlled corporations at the Bank of Crete between July and
September 1988. Details of the charges were not available.
   State auditors have accused the bank's president, George
Koskotas, of embezzling $200 million in bank funds.
   Koskotas fled to the United States in November 1988, claiming
that ranking Socialist officials, including Papandreou, were behind
the multimillion dollar scheme. Koskotas is imprisoned in
Massachusetts awaiting the decision of U.S. authorities on a Greek
extraditon request.
   Papandreou and four former Socialist ministers were indicted by
a special session of Parliament in July 1989 for their alleged
involvement in the Bank of Crete scandal. No date has been set for
their trial.

   Bargainers settled disputes over paring
Medicare benefits and wrestled over other cuts and tax breaks
Thursday as top lawmakers predicted passage of the broad
deficit-reduction bill supported by President Bush.
   None of the outstanding differences was seen as a deal-killer
for the $250-billion collection of tax increases and spending
reductions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush liked
the emerging bill, and that seemed to stamp out the possibility of
any last-minute setback.
   ``With the White House optimistic, one would guess it would be
hard to shipwreck the thing,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,
ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he expected the
House to approve the measure Friday. And little trouble was
expected in the Senate later.
   The package would boost the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax by
about a nickel and increase levies on alcohol, tobacco and fancy
cars as well.
   It would raise - from 28 percent to 31 percent - the income-tax
rate on the richest Americans, but drop the rate paid by the
upper-middle class from 33 percent to 31 percent. The measure also
would reduce the deductions available to people earning more than
$100,000 yearly by 3 percent, and phase out their $2,050 personal
exemptions.
   The plan also aims cuts at veterans, farm aid and other benefit
programs. The details were subject to change in late negotiations.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and Richard Darman,
Bush's budget chief, met for more than two hours on Capitol Hill
with House GOP members, answering questions and seeking support.
   Sununu said that assuming final details were acceptable to Bush,
Republicans should support the package because it contains ``real
and credible'' savings.
   ``I think we picked up votes today,'' said No. 3 House
Republican Jerry Lewis of California. ``I think the president will
have substantial Republican support for the package.''
   Bargainers settled a major difference when they agreed
informally to trim the projected growth of benefits for Medicare
participants - the elderly and handicapped - by $10 billion over
the next five years, officials said. The figure represented the
amount of cuts approved by the House earlier this month, $7 billion
less than the Senate voted for.
   Under the agreement, the $75 annual deductible that
beneficiaries pay for doctors' bill would increase to $100. The
monthly premium - $28.60 this year - would grow gradually to $46.20
by 1995.
   A chief remaining disagreement over Medicare involved cuts in
payments to doctors and hospitals. Those reductions were expected
to total more than $30 billion over the next five years.
   Negotiators worked on other disputes involving:
   -Medicaid, which helps the poor pay their medical bills.
Although the program will be cut, liberals wanted to provide an
additional $2.9 billion for low-income elderly people. The Bush
administration was trying to reduce that figure.
   -Tax breaks for the oil and gas industry totaling $3.5 billion
over five years. They are championed by Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, but opposed by the House.
   -Tax advantages for a wide range of business activities,
including research, and for individuals, including educational
benefits received from employers. These items, sought by the
Senate, would cost $5.6 billion.
   ``We're still working,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Bush, asked how he felt about the package, said as he passed
reporters on a morning jog, ``Feel good about it.'' He turned away
efforts to get him to be more specific as he appeared with
Republican congressional leaders later.
   Some lawmakers emphasized the remaining differences.
   ``There's nothing the president has signed off on yet. It's not
just one issue. There must be two dozen important issues that
haven't been resolved,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
said after an afternoon White House meeting.
   Still, the deal seemed solid.
   Fatigued after a year of relentless budget combat, most
lawmakers seemed to have abandoned their desire to fight much
further. Instead, they appeared ready to end Congress' long
election-year session and return home for the remaining 12 days of
the campaign season.
   ``The timetable is telling us we won't get as much equity in the
package as we'd like,'' said Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., who like
many liberals would have preferred to shift more of the burden to
the wealthy.
   And many lawmakers were displeased with items they believed
would hurt their states.
   For Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., the problem was a provision
forcing state and local government workers to begin paying the 1.45
percent Medicare payroll tax. Government employees in Illinois and
several other states are now exempt from that levy.
   ``I want to vote for it, but that's the killer for me,'' he
said.
   For Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., the problem was the limit the
plan would put on tax deductions for people earning more than
$100,000 annually.
   ``This is a back-door way of raising taxes on two-income
families,'' she said.
   But House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., was counting on
about 50 House Republican votes for the package. That meant for
passage, majority Democrats would have to produce about 170 votes
out of their 258 members - a figure leaders said they would reach.

   The confrontation of multinational forces
in Saudi Arabia with Iraq in occupied Kuwait has the makings of the
largest tank battle since the classic World War II struggle at
Kursk on the Russian Front.
   Several thousand German and Russian tanks fought in that epic
1943 battle, a Russian victory that marked the German ebb on the
Eastern Front.
   Iraq has about 430,000 troops in Kuwait, bolstered by an
estimated 3,500 Soviet-designed tanks, ranging from the aging T-54
to the more advanced T-72.
   They face more than 300,000 troops in the U.S.-led multinational
force with a tank strength expected to reach 1,800 by the end of
the month.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush faces several decisions that
will affect the size and capabilities of U.S. forces in the Mideast
and perhaps signal his intentions in the standoff with Iraq's
Saddam Hussein.
   At the top of the list is whether to enlarge or shrink the
Persian Gulf force, now at 220,000, the subject of talks in Saudi
Arabia this week between ground commanders and the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell. He is due back in
Washington tonight.
   That decision could affect another issue soon to reach Bush's
desk - a Pentagon plan that calls for rotating most troops sent to
the Middle East on a six-month basis.
   The American buildup hit a symbolic juncture Wednesday with the
arrival in Saudi Arabia of the final elements of the 11th Air
Defense Brigade from Fort Bliss, Texas. It was the last combat unit
scheduled for deployment in the region, Pentagon sources said.
   ---&equals;
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - For the second time in 10 days, the United
States has joined a unanimous Security Council vote rebuking
Israel, this time for not cooperating with a U.N. probe into the
Temple Mount killings.
   Not even a last-ditch personal appeal from President Bush to
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir persuaded Israel to change its mind
and officially receive the U.N. investigators.
   The U.N. resolution, approved 15-0 on Wednesday, is largely
symbolic. No sanctions against Israel are expected, said British
Ambassador David Hannay, who is president of the council for
October.
   Still, Hannay said Israel's treatment of Palestinians ``is not
going to go away from the council agenda ... The principal loser by
not receiving the U.N. mission will be Israel.''
   Israeli security forces trying to quell a riot opened fire and
killed 19 Palestinians on Jerusalem's sacred Temple Mount on Oct.
8. Arabs had unleashed a volley of stones on Jews praying below at
the Western Wall.
   ---&equals;
   BOSTON (AP) - Women can now turn back their biological clocks
and get pregnant after menopause by way of test-tube fertilization,
doctors reported today.
   The procedure, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine,
can extend women's baby-making years well into their 40s, 50s and
perhaps even 60s, providing a second chance for those who waited
too long to start families.
   However, some doctors said they had doubts about the wisdom of
childbearing for those who are well past nature's cutoff.
   ``Because we can do something technically does not mean we
should do it indiscriminately,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks. ``The
ability to become pregnant is a physical sign of what nature itself
expects of a woman. You cannot push nature past the point where you
interfere with safety.''
   Rosenwaks is head of the fertility clinic at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, one of several U.S. hospitals
using the new technology, a variation on the now-routine process of
in vitro fertilization.

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - A loose-knit, right-wing coalition
headed toward a landslide victory over former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto today, likely setting Pakistan's struggling
democracy on a more conservative, Islamic course.
   Ms. Bhutto, who claims her August dismissal was a
``constiutional coup,'' refused to concede defeat of her
center-left Pakistan People's Party in Wednesday's parliamentary
election.
   She accused the army-backed caretaker government of large-scale
vote rigging, a charge that may be difficult to prove.
   Opponents called the 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto a sore loser, saying
the stunning victory margin by the right-wing Islamic Democratic
Alliance surpassed even their expectations.
   A 40-member group of international poll-watchers refused
comment.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people line up at the TSUM
department store to buy scarce, rationed food. At a luxury hotel
nearby, Westerners with hard currency enjoy the best of food and
wine.
   Long food lines reflect an economic crisis that is aggravating
social tensions and forcing a traditionally agrarian nation to beg
for food from the West to get through the winter.
   The government has proposed a 300-day moratorium on public
rallies to keep consumer anger from getting out of hand.
   Diplomats in Sofia said they did not expect food riots
immediately, but an energy shortage means the worst is yet to come.
The Soviet Union has reduced oil shipments to Bulgaria and U.N.
sanctions have halted supplies from Iraq.
   At the congress in September of the governing Socialist Party,
the new name of the Communist Party, some officials spoke of unrest
or civil war.
   Even without civil unrest, prospects are gloomy. President
Zhelyu Zhelev denies reports that Bulgaria faces starvation, but
acknowledged recently that ``poverty is a fact.''
   Food stores in Sofia and other cities are virtually bare. Sugar,
cheese, flour, eggs, cooking oil and detergent are rationed.
   As in Romania and the Soviet Union, such ordinary items as light
bulbs, toilet paper and matches are as scarce as food.
   About 500 people waited outside TSUM one October morning. A
woman in her early 60s had been there all night and was near the
head of the line.
   She has a monthly pension of 102.30 leva, the equivalent of only
$15 at the tourist rate of exchange. Hundreds of thousands of
elderly and poor people struggle to get by on much less than the
average wage, which is only 300 leva a month.
   Many Bulgarians hunt for food instead of going to work, or spend
hours in the quest after their regular shifts.
   ``Now the whole morning will be wasted,'' said a man in the
line, who has two children. ``I was on duty until 1 a.m., but I
arrived here at 5.30. If I don't get back home with something,
there'll be trouble in the family.''
   Another shopper said: ``You don't know what you are lining up
for. It may be meat, but you don't know which type or when it will
be gone. It's possible only half the people will get something.''
   Maria Ivanova, a psychoanalyst, was among the few shoppers
willing to reveal their names.
   ``I have to put up a sign at my consultation room saying it will
be closed for several hours so I can go shopping,'' she said.
   Ms. Ivanova, who studied medicine in East Germany, said it was
her birthday but she could not have a party because she had no
food.
   ``I think we won't move ahead without civil war,'' she said.
``If man suffers hunger . . . he is ready for a revolution.''
   At the Western chain hotel near TSUM, the special business lunch
that day cost $25.
   Some help is arriving from the West. The United States has
shipped 100,000 tons of feed corn and the German Red Cross donated
baby food. Japan, Austria, the Netherlands and some other countries
have promised food.
   The European community has pledged $22 million worth of aid for
next year. Bulgaria wants it now.
   Mismanagement and corruption by the rigid Communist regime of
Todor Zhivkov, who was ousted last year, are the main reasons for
Bulgaria's economic troubles.
   Zhivkov replaced well-functioning cooperative farms with huge
``agro-industrial complexes'' for greater central control. The food
situation got worse when 320,000 ethnic Turks, many of them
peasants, emigrated in 1989 to escape growing persecution.
   Industrial pollution has destroyed large tracts of fertile land.
There are chronic shortages of agricultural feed and raw materials
for industry.
   Government officials say stores make shortages worse by holding
food back in anticipation of higher prices.
   Using a new law, police have raided department stores and other
food outlets to find hidden supplies. Heavy fines are imposed on
storekeepers who break the rules.
   Shortages or not, the government plans to remove price controls
and cut government subsidies under economic reforms proposed by
Premier Andrei Lukanov.
   Western financiers say they will not lend Bulgaria more money
for economic recovery unless the Lukanov plan goes through.

   From live reports on the invasion of
Europe to the medical advice of the goat-gland doctor, it's still
all there for anyone to hear. And the good thing is, anyone can
hear it.
   The history in sound, dating back to the 1920s, is available
through more than 3,800 radio broadcasts on file at Memphis State
University.
   While the collection is not the largest of its kind, it's
certainly one of the most accessible. Unlike most radio archives,
it isn't just open to broadcasting students and researchers. Any
radio fan can drop by to listen to a little Abbott and Costello or
perhaps a bit of ``Inner Sanctum.''
   ``Not only can you hear it - if you bring an audio cassette with
you, they'll high-speed duplicate it for you,'' said Marvin
Bensman, founder and chief overseer of the collection.
   An associate professor of broadcast history, Bensman began
putting the collection together in 1969 while working at the
University of Vermont.
   His students, he said, had little access to early radio
broadcasts except through such sources as the National Archives in
Washington.
   ``That's sort of ridiculous, to ask a college student to pay his
way to Washington to listen to some old radio programs for a
course,'' he said.
   From a variety of sources, including former broadcasters or
their families, Bensman has put more than 1,200 radio hours on
tape.
   There's a 1949 pilot of ``Gunsmoke'' starring Mark (that's
right, Mark) Dillon and world-saving battles between ``The Shadow''
and various forces of evil. Fibber McGee and Molly build a doghouse
or search for lost keys while J. Edgar Hoover warns of creeping
communism.
   The collection includes several hours of live coverage of the
Allied invasion of Europe when the outcome of World War II and the
fate of the world was very much unsettled.
   ``Everyone was hanging on their radios to see were we going to
make it,'' Bensman said.
   It also includes a series of shows by Dr. Jospeh R. Brinkley, an
almost-governor of Kansas who broadcast medical advice in the 1920s
and '30s. Brinkley picked up the nickname ``goat gland doctor''
because of claims he could improve the sex lives of his male
patients with animal implants, Bensman said.
   ``He did a 90-minute program where you would write him and
describe your symptoms. He would then diagnose your problem and
prescribe to you over the air,'' he said.
   Raising the ire of the American Medical Association and the
Federal Radio Commission, Brinkley lost his broadcasting license in
Milford, Kan. He moved to Mexico and set up a hospital straddling
the U.S.-Mexican border.
   ``He was a real pioneer,'' Bensman said. ``His voice is
wonderful on the radio. I've listened to the stuff and his advice
is not bad.''
   A stack of 16-inch recording discs of Brinkley's show were
recently found in the attic of his widow, Bensman said.
   While academic researchers and biographers of radio
personalities often use Bensman's radio collection, it can also
come in handy for such people as the daughter of the
``Silver-Masked Tenor.''
   The tenor, whose real name was Josh White, performed on a radio
show sponsored by a tire company in the 1920s. To promote
``silvertone'' tires, program managers staged a yearlong contest
featuring an unnamed singer said to be wearing a silver mask.
Listeners were urged to guess his identity.
   White's daughter contacted Bensman looking for a recording of
her father's voice and a performance by the ``Silver-Masked Tenor''
was found on one of his tapes.
   ``We sent a tape and she was overjoyed,'' Bensman said.
   The older programs in the collection are on 16-inch discs which
can hold up to 15 minutes on each side. The broadcasts are put on
reel-to-reel tapes and then on the cassettes that are made
available to the public.
   The collection continues to grow as more old programs are
located and as modern ones are added to keep up with the evolution
of radio.
   Bensman said he has a list of 60 to 70 programs he still seeks
from the early days of radio.
   ``When we get those, we think we'll have every known program
that ever appeared on the networks,'' he said.
   The sought after shows include such programs as ``Eyes Aloft.''
   ``It's a program about air travel or being in the Air Force, I
think,'' Bensman said. ``It's hard to say. Nobody has heard these
programs in years.''

<HEAD>The ``American Eden'': Inside Wine Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAPA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author James Conaway calls Napa Valley an
``American Eden,'' which turns out to be an apt description of his
book about sex, scandal and sweat among families who built Northern
California's famous wineries.
   ``This is a real place, these are real people in my book,''
Conaway said about his book, ``Napa'' (Houghton Mifflin, $24.95).
``I get as personal as I can because that's the way you write good
books. There are many strong characters. And this is the first time
their story has been told.''
   His book reads like fiction, as the people behind Napa Valley's
most famous labels - Inglenook, Krug, Schram, Beaulieu, Martini and
Mondavi - come to life.
   The Mondavis, Robert and Peter, could be the warring Cain and
Abel without the fratricide. Following a 1965 fist fight between
the two brothers who ran the Charles Krug winery, Peter and the
family fired Robert, who went on to start the Robert Mondavi
Winery.
   Robert Mondavi's two sons, Michael and Timothy, now run the
successful operation.
   ``Everybody talked to me, but I've heard that some people are a
bit bothered by the book,'' the author said. ``They're not used to
being written about in this way. They lead lives that have so far
been unexamined.''
   Volker Eisele, who has grown grapes in the valley for the past
20 years, said the book is accurate and gives a ``behind-the-scenes
glimpse to people who aren't players in Napa.''
   ``I've been hearing through the grapevine that a few people are
unhappy about how hey came out. Maybe it turned out to be too
personal,'' he said.
   Conaway does get past the doors and cellars of Napa's wineries,
spending some time in the bedrooms. But tales of infidelities don't
get much ink.
   ``Occasionally, someone got into bed with someone else's mate,
but bridge was the preferred activity,'' he says in the book.
   Still, Conaway doesn't shy away from telling about Betty Daniel
who, despite her Mormon upbringing, was often unfaithful to husband
John Daniel, who inherited Inglenook from his father.
   ``John ... had economic muscle in the valley and twice got rid
of Betty's lovers by depriving them of jobs, but there was always a
replacement,'' Conaway writes of the Daniels, who eventually
divorced.
   Daniel was among the old families in the lush Napa Valley, which
saw the first planting of grapes in the 1830s after George Yount
settled the area. Until then, the dust and fog-filled valley some
50 miles north of San Francisco had been inhabited only by Wappo
Indians.
   In 1858, a German named Charles Krug began a Napa Valley wine
business, using native Mission grapes. German varieties were soon
thriving in the area, along with vintners such as Frederick
Beringer and Jacob Schram.
   The German-born founders were ``Anglo-Saxons with Mediterranean
delusions, if truth be told,'' Conaway writes.
   Interest in wines of the region increased during the 1880s and
'90s, when Inglenook was built at the height of a silver mining
boom along the Silverado Trail.
   Prohibition, the Depression and World War II put a cork in the
winery business. Some, however, survived. Newcomers such as the
Christian Brothers, the Louis Martini family and the Mondavi family
even prospered.
   At that time, the Italian vintners ``didn't care as much for
quality in wine as for quantity; their product was sold in jugs,''
Conaway writes.
   During the early '50s and '60s, interest in Napa Valley was
rekindled, with speciality wineries starting up and decrepit
properties being renovated.
   The leaders of the latest renaissance included ``refugees from
business, academia and totalitarianism, and some colorful
misfits.''
   By the mid-'70s, when Northern California wines started beating
French wines in taste tests, Napa Valley's boom was on. Every
winery had a tasting room and tourists, many on bicycles, began
traveling valley road en masse.
   Enter politics.
   In the last few chapters of ``Napa,'' Conaway's historical
narrative turns into a cautionary tale about the dangers of
overdevelopment; about 250 wineries now crowd Napa Valley and
nearby Sonoma Valley, compared with just a few dozen 30 years ago.
And a touristy railroad - the Wine Train - runs through the area.
   ``Some would seek to turn the land into tourist attractions,''
with the valley taking on ``a gloss that had more to do with money
than with the product for which it became famous,'' Conaway writes.
   In 1988, Napa County supervisors approved an ordinance that
requires wines from Napa Valley to be made with at least 75 percent
valley grapes. Now, the county is grappling with how much growth to
allow, with grape growers urging preservation as vintners push
expansion.
   ``I think the future is undetermined at this point,'' Conaway
said in an interview. ``I see Napa as a kind of agricultural
Yosemite that doesn't need too much government protection, but it
should be allowed to endure.''

<HEAD>Still Scarred From the Preminger Days</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many stars suffered under the control of
tyrannical movie bosses, and Tom Tryon is one who still shows scars
from working with Otto Preminger.
   However, unlike others who went through breakdowns and even
suicide, Tryon emerged from the experience with a brand-new career
as a best-selling author.
   Tryon served only 3{ years under the legendary Preminger,
starring in ``The Cardinal,'' a 1963 sweeping melodrama.
   ``I had a good run,'' says the actor turned author, who made
films for Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and the Walt Disney
Co. before falling under Preminger's spell. ``And I could have gone
on. But I was afraid someone was going to holler at me.''
   The late Vienna-born Preminger was best known to the public for
portraying sadistic Nazis in such films as ``Margin for Error'' and
``Stalag 17.'' He was known to actors as an absolute terror who
could reduce them to tears, as he did with Marilyn Monroe (``River
of No Return'') and Jean Seberg (``St. Joan,'' ``Bonjour
Tristesse'').
   ``I remember the night `The Cardinal' premiered in the Paris
Opera House,'' Tryon said. ``There was a party afterward at
Maxim's. Everybody was out in the restaurant, and Jean and I were
in a little snuggery together. We had just met, and we had this
shared experience of horror that we were so anxious to communicate
to each other.
   ``That ... (obscenity) came in and started screaming. I'm
talking screaming in the middle of Maxim's. `How dare you be so
rude? I know what you're doing: You're talking about me, telling
mean stories!' Jean fled in tears.''
   On the second day of filming ``The Cardinal,'' Preminger fired
and rehired Tryon within an hour. Tryon said that Preminger
constantly berated him during filming, telling him he was a lousy
actor and making him perform the same scene over and over again.
   Still slender with an actor's handsomeness at 64, Tryon was
recently on the talk circuit to promote his new novel, ``The Wings
of the Morning.'' The book has had a curious history, beginning 13
years ago when he conferred with Robert Gottlieb, then chief at
Knopf publishers.
   ``What's this book you're writing?'' Gottlieb inquired.
   Tryon replied that he had no book, but that he had been
researching the history of his hometown in Connecticut, where an
ancestor had settled in 1640. For three hours Tryon spun tales of
murder, intrigue and feuds. ``Tom, I want that book,'' Gottlieb
concluded. They reached an agreement for the historical novel and
another book. The price: $2 million.
   The author plunged into the story and four years later produced
a 5,580-page tome. But Gottlieb wanted more. Tryon wrote on,
interrupting for other books. Gottlieb left Knopf for the New
Yorker, but the new regime remained patient as the saga grew to
three, then four books. ``The Wings of the Morning'' is the first
of what is called the ``Kingdom Come'' quartet.
   Tryon was well into his 40s before he turned to writing. Born in
Hartford, Conn., and reared in Wethersfield, he served in the Navy
during World War II, then enrolled in fine arts at Yale University.
After studying art in New York, he painted scenery in the Dennis,
Mass., Cape Playhouse. He filled in as a centurion in Shaw's
``Anthony and Cleopatra'' and decided to study acting.
   After a few small roles on Broadway, Tryon came to Hollywood
under a Paramount-Hal Wallis contract that cast him in ``The
Scarlet Hour,'' ``Screaming Eagles'' and ``A Monster From Outer
Space'' (title role). Walt Disney hired him to star in a TV series,
``Texas John Slaughter,'' and the feature ``Moon Pilot.''
   His biggest break came when Preminger cast him in the title role
of ``The Cardinal.'' After another Preminger film, ``In Harm's
Way,'' Tryon did a few small features, then drifted into TV guest
shots.
   Inspired by Ira Levin's ``Rosemary's Baby,'' Tryon tried his
hand at a horror novel. ``The Other'' became a best seller and a
movie. His other books included ``Harvest Home,'' ``Crowned
Heads,'' ``All That Glitters'' and ``Night of the Moonbow.''
   Tryon went through analysis to rid himself of the Preminger
demons. He summed up: ``My life is good. Tranquil is a good word
for it. You know, I quit drinking 10 years ago, and that was a
major change in my life. Because I had the whole thing backward.
   ``I thought I was drinking to cover up my nervousness. But when
I stopped drinking all the nervousness went away.''

<HEAD>`Over My Dead Body,' CBS' New Mystery Series, Is No `Murder He
Wrote'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``It skews old,'' Madison Avenue will say.
``It's `Murder, He Wrote' on the Left Coast,'' critics will say.
But tonight's two-hour premiere o CBS' ``Over My Dead Body'' has
two major assets in its stars.
   Edward Woodward, formerly of ``The Equalizer,'' is one of the
best actors working today and his co-star Jessica Lundy, a newcomer
to series TV, is a perfect foil for this hour-long blend of
screwball comedy and mystery.
   He plays Maxwell Beckett, a successful-yet-blocked crime
novelist with a shadowy background at Scotland Yard; she plays
Nikki Page, an obituary writer and would-be crime reporter for a
San Francisco newspaper.
   Woodward, who won raves for the title role of the film ``Breaker
Morant,'' got Emmy nominations in each of his four years in ``The
Equalizer,'' as McCall, the enigmatic, emotionally exhausted former
counterintelligence agent.
   Woodward gives us a much more complex character in Max Beckett,
who emerges as an entire man, by turns irritable, gallant,
petulant, brave, supercilious and maudlin. It's a fuller
performance, and Woodward must be enjoying it.
   If Woodward ``skews'' toward older viewers, younger viewers will
skew toward Miss Lundy, a New York-trained stage and cabaret
actress who made her film debut in the inauspicious ``Bright
Lights, Big City'' and followed it with ``Caddyshack II.'' A
newcomer to series TV, she's a real find.
   Her Nikki rides a motorcycle and looks great in leathers, but
she's kind of vulnerable. She's smart, capable and can be
blitheringly ditzy, but she exudes a wholesome, well-scrubbed
sexiness that should be universally appealing.
   The ``Murder, He Wrote'' charge might come closer to sticking.
The series was created by David Chisholm and William Link, a
co-creator of ``Murder, She Wrote.'' Beckett surely is the male
couterpart to Angela Lansbury's Jessica.
   If you expect the grim, silver-lighted New York fables of ``The
Equalizer'' you will be disappointed by the golden California tones
that suffuse ``Over My Dead Body.'' It is much lighter fare,
sillier, but stylish and engaging.
   In tonight's two-hour premiere, Nikki witnesses the murder of a
woman in an adjoining apartment building and intervenes. The
problem is that there's no body or evidence of a crime and the
police aren't interested.
   Nikki turns to Max but fails to enlist his aid in investigating
the mystery. Much of the first half-hour consists of her screwball
efforts to secure his assistance.
   Once Max is convinced of her sincerity (or sufficiently
apprehensive of this newest loose cannon in his life of divorce
papers and writer's block), he joins her investigation.
   They are unlikely buddies at best, and slowly they reveal
themselves to each other and the comedy of their older man-younger
woman relationship really starts.
   There's a nicely nutty sequence when Nikki masquerades as an
escort service employee to gain access to a suspect. Lundy's
skillful physical comedy takes the scene a couple of notches higher
and funnier than it was written.
   This brings us to the weakest aspect of ``Over My Dead Body.''
It is not the best written mystery series. Tonight's premiere takes
two hours to accomplish what other shows with large, ensemble casts
did in an hour.
   Tonight's plotline has to do with a killer who's murdering
prostitutes. Very early on, the killer is revealed to us with a
clue so broad and, from a forensic standpoint, so impossible that
there's no suspense.
   The ``clue'' then vanishes from the story and does not figure in
the detectives' solution of the mystery. This violates a couple of
conventions of the genre, but then, there is always ``Columbo.''
   Let it go. The series' potential Friday night audience is not
interested in edge-of-the-seat thriller, but in a comic,
suspense-murder mystery. In ``Over My Dead Body,'' they get it.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   WONDERFUL ANIMATION NEWS!!! DEPT. - Warner Bros. and the Fox
Broadcasting Co. affiliates underscored their ambitions for
television cartoons and younger viewers Wednesday by announcing a
multi-year deal for three animated shows.
   The best news is that one of them, ``Beetlejuice,'' the Emmy
Award-winning series based on the 1988 Warner Bros. movie, is
scheduled to open with 65 all-new episodes as a Monday-Friday
``strip'' in the fall of 1991.
   ``Beetlejuice'' is beautifully animated and possibly the
best-written Saturday morning series (although ``Bobby's World'' on
Fox has attracted a following of bleary-eyed television writers).
   The other two are ``Taz-Mania,'' starring Warner's wonderful
Tasmanian Devil, for a weekly run in the fall of 1991, and
``Batman,'' based on the DC comics character, with an unspecified
release date.
   Warner Bros.' excellent new ``Tiny Toon Adventures'' is
playfully serious about fighting Walt Disney Studios for younger
viewers and quality animation: One ``Tiny Toon'' closed with a
Warner Bros. ``The End'' logo crashing down onto a mockup of a
castle that bore an incredible resemblance to the Magic Kingdom.
   Th-th-that's all, folks!

   They are courted by brokers, exhorted by
advisers, tempted by advertisements, driven by hopes and encouraged
by neighbors and co-workers, but typical American investors don't
give ground.
   The radio blares out prices by the hour, the newspaper compiles
the day's activities, magazines proclaim the efficacy of the latest
investing technique, and a rich uncle relates how he once made a
killing in the market.
   Every day in myriad ways Americans are urged to take a long shot
in stocks, to play the market, to seek a quick fortune, to bet on a
sure thing, to get in on a deal - but, so to speak, they keep their
heads on their shoulders, their feet on the ground, their arms
folded and their wallets in their pockets.
   Difficult as it might be to comprehend, American households for
years have been net sellers of corporate stocks, a trend at odds
with the popular image of investors and in defiance of the intense
efforts of securities marketers.
   True, they may invest in corporate stocks indirectly through
pension funds and mutual funds, but even that trend, a growing one,
usually is viewed as a safe, patient, conservative, long-term
approach to investing.
   An employee benefits firm recently surveyed several hundred,
mostlyigious beliefs.
   In 1978, two Pentecostal families rushed past Soviet guards at
the U.S. Embassy and were given refuge. The families, who became
known as the ``Siberian Seven,'' stayed in the embassy for nearly
five years before they were granted permission to emigrate.

<HEAD>Halloween a Nightmare for Real Freddy Kruegers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY MUTCHLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Freddy Krueger hates Halloween.
   In fact, Oct. 31 is a nightmare for five Fred Kruegers who live
in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois.
   It's particularly tough for the Fred Krueger who lives in
Tobyhanna, Pa. His house is two blocks from Elm Street.
   No kidding. Fred Kruegers, men with the same name as the star of
screen, scream and gore, are alive and well but unenthusiastic
about the holiday that is descended from the medieval All Hallows
Eve.
   The prank calls and weird stares, they say, will be relentless.
   None of the Freds is maimed by scars, has pop-out claws or even
dons a fedora. None has been accused of even one grisly murder,
unlike the prolific maniac featured in the never-ending movie saga,
``A Nightmare on Elm Street.'' But these disparities do not ward
off pranksters.
   ``I got some regular customers on the phone,'' said Fred Krueger
who lives in Olivers Mills, Pa., and works for Liberty Mutual Life
Insurance Co.
   ``It's best to go along with them,'' he said, noting that kids
will just harass him if he sounds mad or hangs up.
   Fred Krueger, a retired banker from Charlotte, N.C., also plays
the demonic role but said he tries to keep it simple because he
once scared a little girl.
   ``She wanted to know if I was the Freddy and I said, `Yeah' and
gave her the laugh,'' said the 75-year-old retiree. ``And then I
said several other things and said I would be over to see her.
   ``There was silence on the phone,'' he recalled. Followed by a
dial tone.
   An understandable reaction. In his most recent movie, ``A
Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Child,'' Freddy Krueger - created by
Wes Craver and played by actor Robert Englund - invades the
semiconsciousness of an unborn child, torturing her mother and
killing off her teen-age friends.
   Probably not the kind of guy you'd want to have over to the
house. Unless, of course, you're Mrs. Krueger.
   Ellen Krueger, who is married to the Charlotte Fred, said her
husband doesn't look anything like the star.
   ``I got a good-looking husband with blue eyes and dimples,'' she
said. ``There's no resemblance.''
   Another Mrs. Krueger, Florence, lives in Tamaqua, Pa., and gets
a lot of silly calls. It bothered her at first, she said, because
she thought someone was playing a cruel joke by asking for her
husband. He died 28 years ago.
   After she and a friend figured it out, Florence decided to
counter with a trick of her own.
   ``Is Freddy Krueger there?'' a caller will ask.
   ``Yes, he is. Hang on,'' she'll reply.
   ``Then I just put the phone down and walk away,'' Florence said,
with a sinister laugh.
   Most of the Freds - and the Mrs. Freds - are good-natured about
their namesakes. But sometimes people go too far, they say.
   Fred Krueger of Norfolk, Va., gets ``tons'' of calls, according
to his 17-year-old son, Philip.
   ``We get mostly little kids calling up. But we did get one guy
that said he was Jason from (the movie) `Friday the 13th,' who said
he was going to kill us,'' Philip Krueger said.
   Information operators are willing to provide phone numbers of
Freddy Kruegers, although occasionally they express incredulity.
   ``You're kidding, right?'' asked an operator in Atlanta.
   ``Yeah, right, Fred Krueger,'' said a Pennsylvania operator,
sarcastically.
   ``I don't believe this. There's a Freddy Krueger listed,'' said
a New York City operator.
   Fred Kruegers listed in Minnesota, Georgia and New York could
not be reached for comment. But a heavy equipment mechanic in
Chicago, who also bears the name, was willing to share a favorite
Krueger memory.
   The 31-year-old father of two recalled a caller who asked him if
he was Freddy Krueger, the movie actor.
   ``Yes,'' the mechanic replied, ``and I'm going to get you.''
They both laughed and the caller hung up.
   Another Fred Krueger was listed in Chicago. But a woman who
answered the phone was not amused.
   ``Look lady, I could care less,'' she said, before hanging up.
``I'm tired of the prank calls.''

<HEAD>Secrets for Solving World Hunger Could Lurk in Amazon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is possible that deep in the Amazon rain
forest in South America are unknown plants that could help farmers
grow crops resistant to insects and disease.
   An Agriculture Department report says the vast tropical forest -
Amazonia - has thousands of plant species that have never been
classified. Some of those might contain valuable genes that could
help feed the world.
   Amazonia stretches over much of Brazil, its sprawl about twice
the size of Alaska.
   Amazonia also extends into Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and
Venezuela. But world attention in recent years has focused on
Brazil and that country's use of forest resources.
   The USDA report describes some of the benefits of protecting the
unknown resources of Amazonia.
   ``Rain forests contain immense genetic inventories, or
biological diversity,'' the report said. ``Although only 7 percent
of the earth's land surface is tropical rain forests, they house
over half of all plant and animal species.''
   Amazonia is particularly rich in this diversity, with ``at least
20 percent of the earth's bird species, over 2,000 species of fish,
and more than 2,500 species of trees,'' the report said. At least
8,000 species of insects have been classified.
   But the potential economic value of Amazonia's biological
diversity is impossible to assess, the report said. Very little of
it has been studied, and just inventorying all the species would be
a formidable task.
   ``One calculation is that it would take 3,000 scientists 50
years just to describe the diversity of life in the Amazon,'' the
report said.
   Even so, it is not hard to imagine that the economic value of
Amazonia's genetic pool would be a large resource.
   ``Many tropical plants, for example, have evolved defense
mechanisms against insects and diseases that might be crossbred
into commercially valuable crops,'' the report said. ``In one
notable instance, an Amazonian wild peanut saves American farmers
an estimated $500 million a year by improving the resistance of
domestic varieties to leafspot.''
   The report - Resource Use and Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon -
was written by economists Jan K. Lewandrowski of the department's
Economic Research Service, and Emily McClain, formerly with the
agency and now at Clemson University.
   Another argument for preserving the world's tropical moist
forests stems from the so-called greenhouse effect caused by
increases in the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
   Tropical deforestation is said to be the second-leading source
of carbon dioxide emissions, after the burning of fossil fuels in
the industrialized countries.
   ``The scientific community, however, disagrees on both the
existence and the consequences of global warming,'' the report
said. ``Hence, the value of keeping carbon sequestered in tropical
forests depends on how real and how damaging one believes this
possible threat to be.''
   Brazil has spent billions of dollars on developing Amazonia the
last 25 years, the report said. And the rate of deforestation has
accelerated since 1980.
   Estimates in 1988 on deforestation ranged from 5.1 percent by
the Brazilian government to 8 percent by Philip Fearnside, a
scientist with Brazil's National Institute of Amazon Research, to
12 percent by the World Bank.
   The report said Fearnside's mid-range estimate would indicate
that an area about the size of Arizona had been cleared as of 1988.
   ``Most deforestation in Amazonia is the result of cattle
ranching, small-scale farming, logging and road construction,'' the
report said. ``Also contributing to the loss of substantial tracts
of forest are mining, hydroelectric dams and urban growth.''
   The report said the Amazon is ``an immense natural resource'' to
Brazilians, and that benefits of conservation must balance against
the country's overall economic and social needs.
   Many in Brazil see world pressure to reduce deforestation in the
Amazon as unjustified and say it has focused on Brazil while
largely ignoring the destruction of forests in the other Amazon
countries - Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.
   ``Furthermore, while the combined forest holdings of these four
countries amount to less than half of Brazil's holdings, the area
being cleared each year is, in sum, greater than the area being
cleared in Brazil,'' the report said.
   The amount of money Brazil can spend on conservation is limited,
and little help has been forthcoming from other countries for
preserving Amazonia.
   Even so, the recent international pressure on Brazil to adopt
more environmentally sound Amazon policies is evidence of world
interest in the value of the huge rain forest.
   ``This is a sharp change from barely a decade ago when the
tropical rain forests were considered as reserves of land for
additional agricultural production needed to feed a growing world
population,'' the report said.
   But if the Amazon rain forest is more important for the world in
general than for Brazil in particular, then some international plan
for paying for its preservation should be considered.
   ``If the world is unwilling to pay for the benefits it derives
from the Amazon forest, then the amount that is ultimately
preserved will be less than is optimal from a global perspective,''
the report said.

   Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit, landed on this
green dot of land off southern China in 1582 to bring the Gospel to
a new world.
   He mastered Chinese, advised the Ming emperor and brought the
principles of geometry from the West, but his dream of a Catholic
China never came true. Ricci died in 1614 and was buried in
Beijing.
   Now, nearly four centuries later, another Jesuit hopes to change
China.
   Father Lancelot Rodrigues, 66, is a silver-haired bear of a man
with a taste for good food and wine. He and a growing number of
other Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy have begun working in
China since the Communist government opened its doors to the world
in the early 1980s.
   Starting in 1985, Rodrigues and his small group of priests and
nuns have run training programs for more than 200 teachers of
handicapped children in China's backwaters.
   They are setting up a rug weaving factory in a poor county of
central Anhui province and hope to build fresh-water fisheries and
other small projects. In 1988, when an earthquake struck Yunnan
province, Rodrigues took blankets to the homeless.
   Last year, the priest approved $140,000 in funds to be used in
China. Most of the money comes from Western European charities,
Catholic Relief Services of Baltimore, Md., and the U.S. Catholic
Conference.
   Other groups endow homes for the elderly, work with the deaf and
provide disaster relief and health care, but nearly all their
projects are in cities. Those organizations include Caritas in Hong
Kong and the Amity Foundation, which is based in Nanjing, China,
but gets most of its money from abroad.
   For Father Lancelot, the countryside is the target.
   ``This is where we should begin,'' he said during an interview
in his cluttered office. ``You can't just go to the mountain and
preach.''
   He and the other Christians tread a fine line.
   Chinese authorities do not allow them to preach. Several
Westerners, most of them Christian evangelists, have been expelled
for alleged proselytizing.
   ``The Bible says, by your works you will see the fruit,''
Rodrigues said. ``By programs like these, we can touch their
hearts.''
   China's Communists have kept a tight rein on religion since
their victory in 1949. They viewed religion as the opiate of the
masses and the thousands of foreign missionaries as the spiritual
arm of Western imperialism.
   By 1957, all religions were organized into groups controlled
directly by the Communist Party.
   Catholics were forced to break allegiance to the pope and
Protestants compelled to sever ties with foreign churches. Those
who resisted were arrested and jailed or sent to labor camps.
   The policy took an increasingly radical turn during the Cultural
Revolution of 1966-76. Bands of Red Guards rounded up thousands of
believers; churches and temples were destroyed.
   Some religious freedom has been allowed since the opening to the
West, but problems remain and China does not recognize the Vatican.
The Union of Catholic Asian News, based in Hong Kong, recently
reported the arrests of 19 priests from an underground church in
Fujian province, southern China.
   ``Those arrested are ready to be martyrs,'' Rodrigues said.
``They are the martyrs of the 20th century.''
   Father Lancelot said he entered the clergy because of his
mellifluous voice, which he often exercises on Spanish love songs
and Irish tunes, like ``Danny Boy.''
   He was born in Malacca, Malaysia, to a half-Irish,
half-Portuguese father and a mother of mixed Dutch and Malay blood.
His father sent the boy to Macao, a Portuguese colony, when he was
12 to be educated by the Jesuits.
   ``Ah, we were rascals then, always writing love poetry to the
ladies,'' he recalled. ``It's the rascals who enter the clergy.''
   Young Rodrigues was a favorite of the bishop of Macao and
serenaded the Jesuit teachers in a clear soprano. At night, he
listened to the history of the Jesuits and Ricci, read by monks
from an ancient book.
   He delivered his first sermon soon after the Chinese revolution
of 1949 in the Canidrome, Macao's dog racing stadium, which had
been converted to house refugees from China.
   After demonstrating his ability to resettle those emigres,
Rodrigues was a natural to run the territory's refugee camps when
the Southeast Asian war ended in April 1975 and Vietnamese started
fleeing in tens of thousands.
   At one point, more than 8,000 boat people were in the Macao
camps. All but 250 have been resettled in the West.
   ``He's the miracle worker of Macao,'' said a Western diplomat
based in Hong Kong. ``Anything he wants done, somehow it happens.''
   Rodrigues knows all levels and degrees of Macao society, which
seems to have paused in the 19th century. At a family-run
restaurant in the old part of town, he pressed a point over
Portuguese white wine as the promise of garlic-laden dishes wafted
by.
   Rodrigues applies the same techniques in China. He first
broached the possibility of a mission over a feast with Chinese
officials from Zhuhai, just opposite Macao.
   ``A little good wine and good food later and we were talking
business,'' he said.
   Since then, Father Lancelot has led missions to a dozen counties
in four other Chinese provinces.
   Initially, officials at Catholic Relief Services called the
program ``Lancelot's folly'' and threatened to cut off the money.
Now, Rodrigues says, China's warm reception has encouraged the
charities.
   Last July, he met Pope John Paul II.
   ``Where do you work?'' the pope asked.
   ``China,'' Rodrigues replied.
   ``Ah, he was jealous!'' Rodrigues told the interviewer with a
chuckle.
   On his frequent visits to China, Father Lancelot refuses to stay
in luxury hotels.
   ``I only have one condition,'' he said. ``I must have a toilet
and a shower.''
   A grin spread across his face and he called out: ``Toilets for
China! The greatest project in the world!''

<DATELINE>MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon after the new U.S. ambassador
arrived with his wife and daughter in September, another embassy
official invited them to spend a relaxing day at the beach.
   Relaxing? While the men and their children splashed in the
Indian Ocean south of Mogadishu, six gunmen invaded the nearby
beach house and robbed their wives.
   ``One of them pointed a gun at my wife's head point blank, then
moved it slightly to the side and pulled the trigger,'' said the
ambassador, James K. Bishop. He added, with diplomatic
understatement: ``It was very unpleasant.''
   No one was harmed, but the thieves escaped with the women's
handbags.
   It was another display of the near-anarchy that grips Mogadishu
as civil war in the countryside reaches closer to the capital.
   ``It's just total chaos,'' a Western aid administrator said.
``Civil administration has broken down almost totally. The
government is virtually in a state of collapse.''
   Gunfire is heard in the city every night. Bombs explode and
armed robbery is so frequent that nearly everyone has a tale to
tell of an assault on his own or someone else's home.
   The robberies are blamed on soldiers, who are said to supplement
their meager pay with nightly forays into residential neighborhoods
darkened by lack of electricity.
   ``Everyone is arming themselves out of fear,'' an aid worker
said, on condition of anonymity. ``You can buy an assault rifle or
pistol on almost any street corner. Soldiers are selling them on
the black market.''
   Thousands of refugees from fighting in the northern, central and
southern parts of Somalia compound Mogadishu's miseries. Many live
with family members in the city, stretching household budgets to
the breaking point.
   A middle-rank civil servant is paid 10,000 Somali shillings a
month, the equivalent of about $3 in a land where hyperinflation
has sent the price of a beer to 2,000 shillings.
   ``We have a great tradition of sharing,'' said Mohamoud S. Nur,
a former adviser to President Mohamed Siad Barre. ``If I have
something and you have nothing, I share what I have with you. It's
the only way people survive these days.
   ``The problem is, there is increasingly less to share. It's
getting desperate. There is real hunger in Mogadishu, real
deprivation, real suffering.''
   Nur, 54, is a sign of the changing times: a critic of the
government unafraid to speak openly, something unheard of a few
months ago.
   He was one of 114 businessmen, intellectuals, civic leaders and
clan elders who signed an anti-government manifesto in August. Nur
and 44 other alleged ringleaders were arrested and taken before a
special court on nebulous sedition charges that could have brought
them life in prison.
   When their trial began in September, however, an estimated
300,000 people filled the streets of Mogadishu in protest. The
judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence.
   ``We were freed in rather unusual circumstances,'' Nur said.
``Nobody who has ever been brought up before this court has ever
been declared innocent or freed for lack of evidence. But in our
case, there was a general uprising and the regime had no other way
out but to release us.''
   Faced with the collapse of its authority almost everywhere in
the country, Siad Barre's government promised a national referendum
on a proposed new constitution. It was scheduled for Oct. 23, but
has been postponed indefinitely
   Critics say the referendum is a joke because the government
cannot conduct a vote in the vast areas it no longer controls.
   Siad Barre also proposed discussions with critics and armed
opponents, to be held in Cairo.
   Two of the three three major insurgent groups agreed to attend,
but hardly anyone expects reslts because the president's enemies
demand his departure as a first step in a solution.
   The slide from instability to chaos in Somalia, a nation of 8
million on the Horn of Africa, is generally considered to have
begun July 14, 1989.
   On that day, Siad Barre's security forces fired on Moslems
protesting the arrest of their religious leaders in Mogadishu.
   Witnesses and international human rights organizations say up to
450 people were killed.
   Soldiers rounded up 48 men and boys the next day, took them to a
beach not far from where the ambassador's party was robbed and shot
them. One survived.
   Human rights groups have compiled long lists of atrocities,
including one at a soccer stadium July 6, when Siad Barre's
personal guard fired on a crowd that jeered the president.
Diplomats and others say 109 people were killed.
   Aid from the United States, once one of Somalia's main
supporters, and other Western donors has been cut drastically
because of the abuses, making an already dismal economic situation
worse.
   Somalia's banking system has collapsed. The only
commercial-savings bank went broke because of unsecured loans to
Siad Barre's relatives and friends. Thousands of people lost their
money.
   An insurgent group called the United Somali Congress, which
began fighting just a year ago, has become a major threat and
controls must of central Somalia. It has attacked towns and
villages within 50 miles of Magadishu in recent weeks.
   The Somali National Movement, an older group, roams the northern
part of the country and Omar Joss, a renegade army colonel, stalks
the south with 600 to 700 men he led in a mutiny last year.
   Nur said his Manifest Group, as it has become known, is trying
to unite the armed bands and other opposition into ``one major
resistance.''
   To characterize the situation and the hopes of Somalians for
change, Nur paraphrased Charles Dickens:
   ``It is the best of times. It is the worst of times. It is a
time of great expectations.''

   Just a handful of votes, President Bush said
almost wistfully, and Republicans could control the Senate.
   But it would take a full hand, five seats, to wrest it from the
Democrats. And that target is almost certainly beyond GOP reach in
off-year elections that Republicans hoped would be at minimum a
stepping stone for 1992.
   That is the more likely year for a congressional shakeup,
despite this election season's voter wrath at a stumbling
government and worsening economy. The performance has hurt Bush's
standing, but he's still not as unpopular as Congress in the public
opinion polls.
   For a 1992 game plan to hold up, the Republicans need to add at
least a seat or two to their 45 in the Senate this year - and
there's at least as good a chance that they will lose seats
instead.
   At this point, strategists in both parties expect little net
change in the party lineups in Congress. A political aide to Bush
hedges the bet by saying that the White House hopes to defy history
and beat the pattern in which a president's party loses House and
Senate seats in off-year congressional elections.
   Counting that way, the administration can claim to have won
while losing.
   Limited losses in the House won't make a lot of difference,
given the lopsided majority the Democrats hold there. Both sides
anticipate Democratic gains in the House, probably in the range of
a half-dozen seats. The White House party has not gained House
seats in any off-year elections since the Democrats did it in 1934.
   But in the Senate, an off-year GOP loss in line with the
historic pattern of three seats would cripple Republican chances of
converting their minority into a majority and thus gaining a piece
of the action at the Capitol during the Bush presidency.
   The lineup is now 55 Democrats, 45 Republicans, five seats short
of the tie that would enable Vice President Dan Quayle to vote the
GOP into control.
   Despite the improbability of it, Quayle said ``maybe we'll be
lucky enough to pick up five seats and then it would be a 50-50
tie.''
   ``It would be my sheer delight to preside over a divided Senate
and to cast tie-breaking vote after tie-breaking vote for the
programs of President George Bush,'' he added during a campaign
stop Thursday in Runnemeade, N.J.
   Bush brought the subject up later Thursday surrounded by the
Congressional Republican leadership in the Rose Garden. ``If we had
more Republicans like everyone who is standing here, we wouldn't be
in this fiscal mess.''
   Republicans held Senate majorities for six of Ronald Reagan's
eight years in the White House, gaining control with a surprise,
dozen-seat gain when he was elected in 1980, losing it in 1986,
when Democrats picked up eight seats in off-year balloting.
   This time, position is a more realistic Republican goal than
control. The Nov. 6 competition is for 18 Senate seats now held by
Republicans, 16 held by Democrats. GOP strategists said they were
out to establish a foundation for gains into the 1990s. Eight GOP
House members left safe seats to bid for the Senate, five of them
against incumbent Democrats, the other three seeking to succeed
retiring Republicans.
   Bush was riding record-high voter approval ratings; while he had
no coattails in winning the White House, his popularity looked like
a major off-year asset. His ratings slipped, then slumped. And
Democrats who had seemed vulnerable early in the year turned out to
be tough at the end.
   In 1992, the Democrats will have 20 Senate seats to defend,
Republicans 14. Eleven of the Democrats are freshman senators, and
will be up for re-election for the first time. There are likely to
be retirements among senior Democrats, some with problems like Sen.
Alan Cranston's savings and loan involvement.
   But those promising circumstances won't make much difference
unless Republicans gain where history says they'll slip. Even then,
the 1992 strategy assumes a strong Bush ticket, with coattails that
were lacking in the 1988 elections.
   While he was winning the White House, the Democrats were gaining
a seat in the Senate. They haven't sustained a net loss there in
any election since 1980.

<TEXT>
   At 12:52 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, doctors at
the National Institutes of Health began transfusing white blood
cells into the tiny arm of a 4-year-old girl with a rare inherited
ailment.
   For 28 minutes she played with her doctors and put stickers on
their lab coats as she helped them launch a new era in medical
treatment.
   She became the first person to receive gene therapy, a treatment
intended to compensate for the genetic defect she was born with by
giving her normal copies of the defective genes.
   News of the experiment had special interest for Suzanne
Tomlinson, a 27-year-old woman from Alexandria, Va.
   ``The idea of gene therapy was always sort of far off and maybe
a little idealistic,'' she said. ``It has been in the back of my
mind that, theoretically, gene therapy would be the key that would
really cure the disease.''
   The disease is cystic fibrosis. She was diagnosed with it when
she was 7 months old.
   The 4-year-old gene therapy pioneer, whose name has been
withheld, has a rare immune system disorder. But gene therapy holds
promise for people with many inherited diseases, including cystic
fibrosis.
   Indeed, recent discoveries about cystic fibrosis have made it
one of the leading candidates for gene therapy, perhaps within the
next five years, said Robert Beall, executive vice president for
medical affairs at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md.
   ``What we thought to be decades away is now years away,'' said
Beall.
   Other potential candidates for gene therapy within the next few
years are certain forms of anemia, hemophilia and muscular
dystrophy.
   It will be at least several months before researchers know
whether gene therapy is succeeding in the 4-year-old girl. Many
researchers, poised to expand the applications of gene therapy, say
the experiment represents the historic opening of a new era in
medicine.
   When the experiment was approved in July, Gerard McGarrity,
chairman of the National Institutes of Health approval panel, said:
``What we're doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines,
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal. Medicine has been
waiting thousands of years for this.''
   Tomlinson, too, has been waiting. Her parents have long been
active with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and she works there as
consumer affairs coordinator.
   She was married earlier this year and attends law school at
night. But she still makes time to follow cystic fibrosis research,
including the several-year-long debate over the ethics and risks of
gene therapy.
   The decision to proceed ``shows that society is willing to
accept this,'' she said. Criticism of the experiment was important,
because ``it makes people think about the seriousness of this
work,'' Tomlinson said.
   Scientists worry that putting new genes into the body could
trigger cancer or other problems. And some worry about the ethics
of altering human genetic makeup.
   ``But I don't want to see them (the critics) stop it,''
Tomlinson said. ``I don't want their fear of the unknown to hold us
back.''
   Last summer, researchers found the gene that is defective in
people with cystic fibrosis, and this year they showed that the
defect could be corrected in the test tube.
   The next experiment will be to try to insert the normal cystic
fibrosis gene into mice, and then try again in larger animals, such
as sheep, Beall said.
   Then human experimentation could begin. Because the most
important symptom of cystic fibrosis is the accumulation of mucus
in the lungs, an aerosol spray that delivered genetically
engineered cells to the lungs might be all that is required for
most patients.
   Tomlinson has a mild case of cystic fibrosis. She follows a
physical therapy regimen every morning to dislodge mucus in her
lungs, and she takes enzyme pills with every meal to help digest
her food.
   Several times a year she is treated for lung infections, usually
managing to avoid the hospitalizations that many people with cystic
fibrosis undergo.
   ``I've really been able to lead a full life,'' she said.
   As researchers scramble to finish the preliminary experiments to
pave the way for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis, Tomlinson is
uncertain what that means to her.
   Despite her enthusiasm, she isn't sure she'll volunteer to be
one of the first to try the new treatment.
   ``I want to be sure it works,'' she said. ``I used to do more
research, but now because there's so much going on in my life, and
I'm healthy, I guess I'm more skeptical.''

   The radio goes silent as stations drop out
of range.
   Ghostly sand dunes with cliffs that look like the jagged end of
a broken bone whip by the car's windows.
   Grit gets in the mouth, the hair, the eyes. Only bunch grass
holds the sand down. There are only a few short evergreens, rolling
hills, cattle, telephone wires and highway.
   One-quarter of Nebraska, about 19,000 square miles, is made up
of this mysterious sand, once thought uninhabitable, now a major
source of the state's cattle revenue.
   It's the largest sand dune area in the Western Hemisphere and
one of the world's largest grass-stabilized dune regions.
   The Nebraska Sandhills stretch from South Dakota to North Platte
and from Alliance in the Panhandle to Neligh in the east-central
part of the state.
   There are oases. Small lakes burst out of the Ogalala aquifer,
a stretch of underground water that spreads from South Dakota and
Wyoming into New Mexico and Texas.
   The Niobrara, Snake, Loup and Dismal rivers cut through the
land. At the edge of the Sandhills, the state's largest reservoir -
Lake McConaughy - sparkles in the sun.
   Stories abound about the sand's origins.
   ``I've heard everything from they were formed out of a giant
lake . . . to they were deposited out of glaciers, out of the Ice
Age,'' said Jim Swinehart, research geologist at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln.
   Recent studies indicate the dunes formed out of windblown
deposits from rivers that moved across Nebraska and then dried up
5,000 to 10,000 years ago, he said.
   Precipitation increased and grass stabilized the dunes until
about 3,500 years ago, when they dried up once again. About 1,500
years ago precipitation increased and the dunes stabilized again,
with minor periods of drought, he said.
   There is concern that any warming of the Earth, such as the
greenhouse effect, could return central Nebraska to a desert with
moving sand dunes, Swinehart said.
   ``Some say that in less than 50 years, we might return to dry
conditions,'' Swinehart said. ``Pretty soon, dunes would be over
the roads, blocking the rivers.''
   U.S. Geological Survey crews are studying areas of the Great
Plains, including the Sandhills, that are susceptible to wind
erosion. Mapping and soil sampling should help scientists determine
how dry it has to get before vegetation begins to die, geologist
Chris Schenk said.
   For now, there is just enough precipitation in the Sandhills -
23 inches a year in the east to 17 inches a year in the west - to
keep more than 498,000 head of cattle fed.
   Figures compiled for Jan. 1 showed 1.7 million beef cows in
Nebraska, fourth in the country behind Texas, Missouri and
Oklahoma, said Jack Aschwege, a statistician with the Nebraska
Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Cash receipts for cattle and calves in Nebraska in 1988 totaled
$4.4 billion - 55 percent of the state receipts for agriculture,
Aschwege said.
   ``The Sandhills have been over time renowned for its good cattle
grazing capabilities,'' said Dennis Findley of the Texas
Agricultural Statistics Service.
   ``It's real cowboy country, there's no question about that,''
said Charles Flowerday, co-editor of the book ``The Atlas of the
Sandhills.''
   ``It's the kind of place where you see certain hallmarks of the
late 19th century,'' Flowerday said. ``Rounding up cattle on
horseback, separating out calves and branding them.
   ``But alongside these are harbingers of the 21st century:
satellite dishes, personal computers to manage ranches, electronic
marketing.''
   Ranchers are largely responsible for keeping the land alive,
Flowerday and others said. Measures such as controlling prairie
fires and avoiding overgrazing have even improved the land, they
said.
   ``It's good ranching country - but you have to treat it with
respect or the sand will start to roll,'' said Chet Paxton, an
81-year-old rancher who lives in Thedford in the heart of the
Sandhills.
   Paxton's parents moved to the area when he was 2 and soon
learned farming wouldn't work. The Paxtons now own 1,500 head of
cattle on 25,000 acres of land.
   ``It was rough,'' Paxton said of the early days. ``Mother was
used to Missouri and a lot of timber. She felt real bad about the
barren land.''
   But Paxton and others persevered.
   The Sandhills weren't always known as good ranch country. Early
ranchers and farmers approached the forbidding edge and ventured no
farther, afraid of the land and of Indians.
   In 1795, James Mackay led an expedition for the French-owned
Upper Missouri Co. His impression: ``A great desert of drifting
sand, without trees, soil, rock, water or animals of any kind,
excepting some little varicolored turtles, of which there are vast
numbers.''
   Reviews did not improve soon.
   In 1855, Lt. G.K. Warren, a topographical engineer with the
Army, followed the Middle Loup River through the heart of the
region. He wrote:
   ``We . . . found the impracticability for almost any purpose so
marked that it seems like a great waste of time to have made the
exertion we have. Our greatest wish is to get away from it as soon
as possible and never return.''
   But by the late 1870s ranchers were moving in. Stories vary, but
one heard often is that cattle drifted into the hills during a
blizzard. Ranchers searching found not only the lost cattle but
large herds that had been there for years - and were well fed and
watered on the native grasses and many small lakes.

   Mullen, population 552, is the only town in
Hooker County, which itself has only 788 residents. And that's
quite enough, thank you.
   ``It's a small town and there ain't much here, but it beats
living in the city,'' said Edith Cash, who cooks at Big Red's Cafe.
   Mullen has two restaurants, a bowling alley, a two-block main
street and a bank. The library and the courthouse sit side-by-side.
   Sand dunes separate Mullen and other small towns, such as
Whitman in neighboring Grant County.
   Windmills, cattle and huge ranches mark the forbidding land once
thought uninhabitable.
   ``We've traveled quite a bit and never have seen better ranch
country,'' said Earl Monahan, 90, who lives about four miles off
Highway 2 near Hyannis.
   ``I was born right up here about 50 yards,'' Monahan said,
pointing from his den to some unseen spot behind him. ``It's kind
of a flat place.''
   Few people are certain how much land Monahan's family works at
the Circle Dot Ranch. He says he runs enough cattle to graze the
grass off the land and has enough land to graze the cattle.
   Monahan and other residents speak about the area with an
affection rooted in practicality. Monahan knows how to fence his
cattle to provide shelter from storms. He often worked 12 hours a
day, seven days a week.
   Friendly people, a good environment for raising children and a
small-town atmosphere are the most important elements of life in
the Sandhills, said Thedford Board of Trustees Chairman Albert
Fisher.
   ``Basically all our houses are full. For working people, it's
about the same town as it was in 1980,'' Fisher, a field technician
for Consolidated Telephone Co., said. ``But nowadays people have
smaller families.''
   Preliminary 1990 census figures indicate Thedford, one of three
towns in Thomas County, has a population of 232, compared with 313
in 1980.
   The census figures indicate Mullen's population has dropped from
720 in 1980 to 552, and Hooker County's population has declined
from 990 to 788.
   A dentist comes to Mullen twice a week. There is a clinic, but
the closest hospital is 75 miles south in North Platte. There is a
high school and a grade school but some students travel 40 miles
each way.
   ``I guess when you decide to live here you don't worry too much
about that because you know what the situation is,'' said Dick
Macke, who grew up in the area, co-owns a grocery store and heads
the village council.
   Besides, said Fisher, ``You kind of get the sand in your blood
and it stays there.''

   If it looks like a wolf, howls like a wolf,
and leaves tracks like a wolf, is it really a wolf?
   Dale Wondercheck, biologist at the Rogue River National Forest,
wants to trap one this winter to find out whether the endangered
gray wolf is moving back into Oregon, or people have been turning
out wolves and wolf-dog crosses they could no longer keep as pets.
   ``It's like hunting Bigfoot,'' said Wondercheck. ``Except there
are a lot more sightings - too many for them to be discounted as
kooks. What we do know is people are seeing some large canines out
there.''
   The last confirmed wolf in Oregon was killed in 1946 at the
Umpqua National Forest, Bill Haight of the Oregon Department of
Fish and Wildlife said.
   The packs of wolves that once roamed the Northwest's plains and
mountains were hunted with a vengeance from 1915 to 1929 to keep
them from preying on livestock.
   Though gray wolves survive in the northern Rocky Mountains and
have recently moved into Washington's northern Cascade Range, canis
lupis was generally believed to have been wiped out in Oregon.
   The state isn't even included in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service's recovery plan, though it is part of the wolf's historic
range, said an on Oct. 1) which will allow it

the president of the oversight board.
   ``If the RTC meets its target of 192 new resolutions, it will
have sold or closed approximately 90 percent of all thrifts seized
by the RTC to date,'' Monroe said.
   ``It is important for the RTC to move forward with these
resolutions and to continue to accelerate the pace of asset sales,
which should only be enhanced by our recently issued policies on
securitization and seller financing,'' he said.
   The oversight board sets policy, approves the financing and
provides general oversight supervision for the Resolution Trust
Corp. in its task of liquidating the nation's failed savings and
loan associations.

<HEAD>The Search for Safe Mayonnaise Made at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of America may not be distressed by
government warnings to avoid homemade mayonnaise because of fears
that the raw eggs it contains could cause food poisoning.
   But to people like Harold McGee, who writes about kitchen
science and lore, something clearly had to be done.
   McGee, in a letter published in the Oct. 25 edition of the
journal Nature, said he had tested mayonnaise and other yolk-based
sauces made by first boiling the lemon juice or vinegar and yolks
in a microwave oven before adding the oil.
   ``The reason I published that article is to advise the public
health authorities,'' McGee said from his home in Palo Alto, Calif.
``My hope is that it will encourage the Centers for Disease Control
and the Food and Drug Administration and people like that to test
it.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises that eggs must reach
an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees to be considered free
of salmonella bacteria. This means the yolk and the whites have to
be firm, the USDA said.
   According to the American Egg Board, the risk of a
salmonella-infected egg is one in 10,000 at home. In restaurants or
cafeterias, the risk increases because so many eggs are used at
once and one could contaminate a bowlful.
   ``One of the things that really got me to thinking about it was
reading the paper and seeing a recipe from a distinguished French
chef for aioli calling for store-bought mayonnaise because he said
he just couldn't recommend the homemade,'' McGee said. ``I thought
there just had to be a way of getting around it.''
   Chef Julia Child has developed a mayonnaise using cooked eggs,
which she said is very easy to make and ``you'd never know'' the
difference. Barbara Kafka, author of ``Microwave Gourmet'' and the
``Microwave Gourmet Healthstyle Cookbook,'' has developed a recipe
for an eggless garlic mayonnaise.
   Once McGee, author of ``On Food and Cooking'' and ``The Curious
Cook,'' had a recipe he liked, he hauled his microwave oven to a
lab at Stanford University for tests.
   ``The experiments really showed that you can start with 5
billion bacteria in a single egg yolk and have none at the end,''
because the yolks reach or come very close to the boiling point, he
said.
   Acids - the lemon juice or vinegar - also help kill bacteria,
but ``only over a period of hours to days,'' McGee wrote in Nature.
``Under suitable biochemical and thermal conditions, egg yolks can
be boiled without curdling them or fatally compromising their
ability to produce smooth, stable emulsions.''
   The microwave ``really works like a charm for this. It works so
much better than the stove top,'' McGee said. ``It's the first
thing I've come across where it's just perfect.''
   McGee tried his handiwork on unsuspecting friends, who couldn't
tell the difference between it and mayonnaise with raw yolks. He
said he even had a hard time distinguishing them in a blind test.
   The strong cooked egg flavor people expect is absent because it
actually comes from the whites, he said.
   But Kafka, who tried McGee's method, said she had to use 1{ cups
of olive oil to tone down the cooked lemon taste.
   ``Is it a mayonnaise to kill for? No, but it does work,'' she
said.
   It is, however, mayonnaise that won't kill, said Bruce Stocker
of Stanford, in whose lab the tests were done. The cooking method
destroys the salmonella bacteria, he said.
   The test mayonnaise was not tasted because of safety rules in
the laboratory, Stocker said.
   And he hasn't made it at home. ``I'm not a mayonnaise maker
myself, but I think it's a good contribution. I'm not much of a
cook,'' he said.
   Kay Engelhardt, test kitchen supervisor at the Egg Board, said:
``I don't know how many people make their own mayonnaise. I don't
think it's a critical situation.''

<HEAD>Personality Changes Documented in Dementing Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blood vessel disease in the brain that attacks
mental abilities also frequently alters personality, a study
suggests.
   The personality changes appear not to be due simply to
intellectual deterioration, researchers said.
   The study focused on multi-infarct dementia, which may cause
about 20 percent of cases of progressive loss in mental faculties
among the elderly. It results from obstructions in blood flow to
parts of the brain.
   The study included 20 male patients whose average age was about
70. Researchers asked a wife or daughter who was acting as
caretaker to fill out a questionnaire about personality changes
since the disease began.
   Results said the patients had become less energetic, practical,
mature, enthusiastic, happy, self-reliant, generous, stable, mature
and talkative and become more cruel and unreasonable.
   No change occurred in affection, caution, fondness of company,
irritability, excitability or temper.
   A comparison group of 30 healthy elderly men showed no
significant personality changes due to retirement, as assessed by
their wives.
   Knowing about personality changes may alleviate some distress in
multi-infarct patients and their caregivers, said the researchers,
from the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los
Angeles, and the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
   Their study is published in the fall issue of the journal
Psychosomatics.

<HEAD>Some Coaches, Athletes Turn to Heart Monitors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coaches and trainers striving to keep their
players fit and keep injuries to a minimum have added wireless
heart rate monitoring units to their list of equipment.
   Among well-known athletes who have used the monitors are cyclist
Greg LeMond, the three-time Tour de France champion; Norway's
Ingrid Kristiansen, the world's fastest woman's marathoner; and
Mark Allen, winner of the Ironman Triathlon. Teams or organizations
that have used them include pro football's Chicago Bears, pro
hockey's Los Angeles Kings, the U.S. Biathlon Association, the U.S.
Olympic Training Center and the U.S. Shooting Team.
   The death of college basketball star Hank Gaithers of
Loyola-Marymount heightened the need for thorough testing and
evaluation of athletes.
   George Grippo, president of Polar USA, the Stamford, Conn.,
company that is the leader in heart monitoring equipment, estimates
100,000 units are being used by athletes and teams.
   Studies published in the journal Physician and Sportsmedicine
and the New Zealand Journal of Sports Medicine indicate excellent
correlation between readings obtained by wireless monitors and
hospital hard-wire monitors.
   Dr. Kenneth Cooper, director of the Aerobic Center in Dallas,
says the units are valuable for cardiac rehabilitation programs in
which the exercisers have to know when they've reached their
optimum heart rate.
   A Dutch sports medicine expert, Dr. Peter G.J.M. Janssen, in his
book, ``Training Lactate Pulse-Rate,'' has shown that athletes who
track their heart rates during training stand the best chance of
improving their endurance, stamina and aerobic capacity while
reducing racing times and the risk of injury.

   High jet fuel costs are accelerating the
cutbacks and asset sales now reshaping the nation's airlines, and
the industry that emerges may disappoint many travelers.
   ``We probably will see some constriction of the air service
available to the American public unless we see fuel prices fall,''
Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association of
America, said Wednesday.
   Sustained jet fuel prices at $1.25 per gallon or more would
``require the total restructuring of an industry,'' Aaronson said
at a news briefing.
   In that scenario, service could be cut back in smaller markets
and fewer flights in general could make it harder for business
travelers to plan same-day roundtrips to many destinations.
   Many business people would end up staying out of town overnight
for lack of connecting flights. Discount fares also could become
scarce.
   Such gloomy forecasts are circulating as the high price of oil
has combined with sluggish demand for travel to deal a double blow
to an industry that has announced the elimination of some 10,000
jobs since the invasion.
   Some carriers are cutting passenger capacity and selling off
important routes as they try to shrink to sizes where they can be
profitable.
   In one of the biggest developments so far, struggling Pan Am
Corp. agreed Tuesday to sell most of its prized London routes to a
healthier competitor, UAL Corp., for $400 million.
   ``The rising fuel cost is a catalyst for these asset
transfers,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.
``There's a whole series of asset transfers taking place from the
weak carriers to the strong carriers.''
   Future shakeups in the industry could be similarly speeded up,
experts said.
   In addition to United, analysts said the strong airlines that
stand to gain from the industry shakeup are American and Delta.
Likely losers besides Pan Am include Eastern, Continental, Midway
and USAir.
   In another example of the industry's troubles, Continental
Airlines said Wednesday it had considered filing for reorganization
in bankruptcy court recently but opted instead to try unspecified
alternative strategies for restoring the company's financial
health.
   Aaronson said Continental's troubles ``could just be an example
of what other companies are wrestling with. There are a number of
carriers that are worried.''
   Jet fuel moved from about 60 cents a gallon before Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2 to more than $1.25 in recent weeks. It has since
dipped below $1, but the airlines realize they can't count on lower
prices in a market being driven by rumors about the fate of the
Persian Gulf standoff.
   Aaronson predicted more layoffs are inevitable, even if fuel
costs fall.
   Analysts have said the Gulf crisis is pushing the industry
toward record losses in 1990, perhaps exceeding $1.5 billion. The
crisis also has dimmed the outlook for next year.
   ``We probably would have seen a moderate loss in 1991,''
Aaronson said. ``It was looking like a week year. Now, it's
devastating.''

<HEAD>Bankers Wary of Loans With Environmental Risk After Court Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Normally, when one of the State Bank of
Countryside's better customers wants to borrow money to buy some
property, there's a pretty good chance the bank can arrange a loan.
   But when the suburban Chicago bank was asked recently to lend
money to buy 40 acres of railroad property, the answer was:
absolutely not.
   ``We never knew what was coming in on those railroad cars,''
said Thomas P. Boyle, Countryside's senior vice president for
lending.
   ``So we backed away - even though they were a good customer.''
   Boyle's anxiety over such a loan can be traced to a federal
court ruling made four months ago in Atlanta.
   There, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a Georgia
case that lenders can be held liable for the costs of cleaning up
properties that become contaminated by toxic materials.
   The decision, said Washington attorney J. Kent Holland Jr.,
``turned things upside down.''
   With their share of cleaning up hazardous chemical sites
potentially costing lenders millions of dollars, bankers say
they've quicky developed cold feet about lending money for anything
with the slightest hint of environmental trouble.
   ``It's making everybody a little gun-shy about commercial
loans,'' Boyle said.
   ``We are considering delaying all commercial lending until we
get environmental statements,'' said St. Louis banker Walter C.
Branneky, who, like Boyle, was among about 50 bankers who attended
a discussion on environmental liability this week at the American
Bankers Assocaition convention.
   ``Obviously, it will slow down lending,'' said Branneky,
chairman of the St. Johns Bank &amp; Trust Co.
   Holland, who specializes in environmental law, said the 11th
Circuit found that Fleet Factors Corp. was liable as a secured
creditor of the contaminated Swainsboro (Ga.) Print Works property,
even though it was not involved in the handling of hazardous waste.
   The court said that Fleet's role in the financial management of
the facility put it in a position where it had a ``capacity to
influence'' waste management decisions, according to Holland.
   The 11th Circuit's decision has been appealed to the Supreme
Court, Holland said.
   Holland said that in the wake of the court ruling, the House,
the Senate and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have
launched separate efforts to limit secured creditors' liability in
such cases.
   In his opinion, none of the measures would go far enough.
   Holand said the 11th Circuit acknowledged that its decision
could discourage some investment.
   ``I would assume that's exactly what the reaction would be,'' he
said.
   But the court also said it would encourage lenders to pay closer
attention to where money goes.
   David J. Dybdahl, a Madison, Wis., insurance broker who
specializes in environmental matters, said it is difficult for
lenders to protect themselves from toxic liability. Most commercial
liability policies contain pollution exemptions, he said.
   Dybdahl, managing director of Environmental Risk Management at
Corroon &amp; Black of Wisconsin Inc., said there are some steps
lenders can take to prevent becoming entangled in an environmental
problem, including a three-phase site audit.
   But such a process, which includes a review of regulatory files
and collecting soil samples, could cost as much as $50,000.
   Some say bankers are overreacting to the court decision. A
Charlotte, N.C., organization, the Southern Finance Project,
studied lender liability and found that only seven lenders have
actually had to pay the EPA for hazardous material damage since the
``Superfund'' clean-up program began in 1980.
   The SFP study also said that in most of the cases, the amount
paid by lenders was negligible.
   Holland discounted the significance of that study, telling the
bankers, ``You do have enemies out there.''
   Dybdahl said an environmental liability claim could be
financially disastrous.
   ``When you get an environmental claim it's not going to be for
$500,'' Dybdahl said. ``It's a good idea to have a pre-set plan of
what to do if something happens.''

<TEXT>
   As tabloid entertainment, the mini-trial of
Michael Milken has been short on bombshells and long on insinuation
with a few salacious stories from Wall Street's trenches circa
1985.
   Paranoid Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond workers run water
faucets to drown out conversations. Documents burn in a fireplace.
Cryptic orders are barked out, possibly instructions to break the
law.
   But the special hearing on unadmitted crimes by the former
Drexel junk bond wizard has centered largely on the intricacies of
preferred stock, equity kickers and leveraged buyouts.
   The hearing also has cracked a window on the most celebrated
case of Wall Street crime in the 1980s, offering insight into
Milken's work and raising questions about the government's heralded
prosecution.
   Testimony finished Tuesday on the second of three alleged
illegal transactions presented before U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood, who will use the information in sentencing Milken on his
guilty plea to six felony counts.
   The government contends the unproven crimes reflect a pattern of
lawbreaking by Milken that merits a long prison stay. The defense
says Milken's crimes were isolated instances of going too far to
help clients.
   After seven days of testimony by 14 government witnesses,
prosecutors haven't overwhelmingly proven Milken guilty of the
systematic skulduggery described in court papers.
   There has been occasional damaging testimony, a charge of
violating Drexel policies and descriptions of questionable and
possibly illegal behavior by Drexel underlings, but no smoking
guns.
   Whether the signs of shady behavior by Milken constitute what
prosecutors have described as ``a pattern of calculated fraud,
deceit and corruption of the highest magnitude'' is for Wood to
decide.
   But after four years, a dropped 98-count racketeering indictment
and a case that relies on testimony by Milken associates who cut
11th-hour deals to avoid prosecution, Milken's team so far has been
crowing.
   ``See, I told you, no bribery!'' a defense lawyer said after
testimony finished on one of the allegations.

<HEAD>Milken Bodyguards, Shopping Cart of Evidence</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It's been standing-room-only at Manhattan federal court, site of
dozens of past big-name trials - Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Alger
Hiss, Leona Helmsley, Imelda Marcos.
   Seating is divided, as at a wedding. Milken's wife, Lori,
mother, Fern, brother, Lowell, Lowell's wife, Sandy, and Lowell's
lawyer, Michael Armstrong, occupy a front row. The opposite side is
reserved for the U.S. Attorney's Office.
   About 100 reporters, lawyers, former Drexel workers and Milken
friends strain to hear the proceedings in the ninth-floor courtroom
over the air conditioner or howling wind. The witness microphone
constantly slips down.
   Eight or more attorneys plus Milken ring the defense table,
passing notes and sometimes smirking during government questioning.
Young associates scurry to hand over documents and transcripts.
Paralegals and Milken bodyguards stand near the defense prep room.
   By contrast, there are just four or five government lawyers and
no retinue of aides. Lead prosecutor John Carroll himself usually
wheels in a shopping cart brimming with materials.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Rumpled Defense Lawyer vs. Textbook Prosecutors</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One sure way to gauge the mood of Milken's defense team is to
watch Arthur Liman.
   The Yoda-faced lawyer with the unrelenting New York accent
gained national attention for grilling Oliver North during the 1987
Iran-Contra hearings. Disheveled and ungainly, he jams his hands in
the pockets of his buttoned jacket during questioning, tie hanging
in the breach.
   While prosecutors Carroll and Jess Fardella elicit prepared
testimony by reading a list of questions - sometimes typewritten -
Liman works from notes scrawled on slips of yellow paper.
   When Wood rebuffs his objections - as she does frequently -
Liman slumps in his chair and shakes his head. His line of
questioning has caused the normally even-tempered judge to lose her
patience.
   On days when Liman believes the defense has done well, he holds
court with reporters, schmoozing about old times with newspaper
columnist Murray Kempton or answering questions. Other days, Liman
and associates leave hastily.

<HEAD>A Trial But Not a Trial</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The hearing carries a lower burden of proof than at a trial,
which may help the government. Evidence gathering is limited,
another defense hurdle. Hearsay by witnesses is allowed.
   Wood has said she is using the proceeding to gain insight into
Milken's professional character. She is unlikely to pronounce guilt
or innocence on the three transactions.
   The hearing has offered a picture of life at Drexel as described
by people who until now were faceless names in the government
probe. With live evidence after four years of legal maneuvering, it
is the first chance to assess what Milken did or didn't do, at
least in a few instances.
   ``I think it's completely riveting,'' said magazine journalist
Jesse Kornbluth, who is writing a book on Milken and the 1980s.
``Yes, I nod out from time to time. But for those who know what
they're looking at, who know the context and the subtext, it's the
best show in town.''

<HEAD>Software Firm's Call Disables Revlon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A phone call was all it took to cripple
Revlon Inc., the nation's largest manufacturer of mass-market
cosmetics, according to a lawsuit.
   A small software firm used high-tech guerrilla tactic to
``repossess'' its product from Revlon for non-payment, shutting
down two of Revlon's four national distribution centers for three
days.
   Revlon filed suit this week in Santa Clara County Superior Court
against the company, Logisticon of Santa Clara.
   ``We didn't have any remedies left as a small company,'' said
Donald Gallagher, president of Logisticon, which has annual sales
of less than $20 million.
   Revlon, with annual sales of $3 billion, hired Logisticon last
year to develop inventory control software for warehouses in
Phoenix, Ariz., and Edison, N.J.
   Revlon claimed the software never worked properly, and on Oct. 9
notified Logisticon that it wanted to cancel its $1.2 million
contract and would withhold further payments until the software
worked.
   A week later, Logisticon took its own action in the middle of
the night, using a phone link and computer access codes to disable
all its software in Revlon computers.
   ``During this period, Revlon could not process inventory or
sales orders and was unable to identify and distribute products in
the marketplace,'' Revlon said in its lawsuit.
   Hundreds of Revlon workers were sent home.
   Gallagher sent Revlon a letter by fax a few hours after the
shutdown, saying he was ``forced into using the only leverage
available'' because Revlon was refusing to pay for software it had
been using for several months.
   ``When and if an agreement is reached on the outstanding
payments, the (software) systems can be restored in a few hours,''
Gallagher said in the letter.
   Revlon is seeking unspecified damages for the shutdown.
   ``When it became obvious that the unsuccessful relationship
between Revlon and Logisticon had to end, Logisticon and Gallagher
used their familiarity with Revlon's computer system to commit . .
. extortionate acts,'' the suit says.
   Revlon wasn't able to resume operations until Logisticon - under
some pressure, Gallagher said Tuesday - restored its software on
Oct. 19.
   Gallagher described the termination as a ``repossession'' of
Logisticon software and denied allegations that his company
destroyed any Revlon data in the process.
   ``The substance of this dispute is that a giant corporation,
Revlon, wrongfully is utilizing software prepared by a very small
company, Logisticon, and refusing to pay amounts which are
rightfully owed,'' Logisticon said in a memo filed Monday in
Superior Court.
   A spokesman for Revlon at its New York headquarters said the
shutdown would not cause any shortage of its products on store
shelves.
   A hearing has been set for Nov. 15.

<HEAD>Gas Price Jump May Be Causing Shift From Trucks to Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15.4 percent rise in mid-October sales of North
American-built autos may indicate the beginning of a shift from
light trucks to more fuel-efficient cars, analysts say.
   The 10 major companies making cars and light trucks in the
United States on Wednesday reported a 4.3 percent increase in truck
sales, pushing total vehicle sales up 11.3 percent.
   ``I think car sales may be benefiting from a shift in mix away
from trucks and toward cars,'' said auto analyst David Healy of
investment banker Barclays de Zoete Wedd of New York City. ``It's
the only response I can detect to the higher gasoline prices.''
   Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and the
accompanying rocketing of gasoline prices, automakers have said
they weren't seeing a shift from large, gas-gulping cars to
smaller, more fuel-efficient cars as they saw in the oil crises of
the 1970s.
   In the '80s, the popularity of trucks, including compact
pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, soared. But trucks
typically aren't as economical as cars and now, analysts say, the
lure of trucks may be waning.
   ``I kind of have a suspicion that the guy who has been buying a
truck as his primary personal transportation vehicle is opting out
of that vehicle and moving back to a passenger car,'' auto analyst
Joseph Pillippi of Shearson Lehman Brothers said Wednesday.
   He said another factor may be that cars bought in the boom years
of the mid-1980s are getting old, have been paid for and are prime
for replacement.
   ``They are starting to age out and reach their appointed hour
for trade-in time,'' Pillippi said.
   The 10 major U.S. automakers said their cars and trucks sold at
an average daily rate of 31,328 during Oct. 11-20, compared with
28,156 in mid-October 1989.
   Car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., rose 11.6 percent, one of the biggest year-to-year jumps of
1990.
   Sales of cars made in Japanese automakers' U.S. plants rose 42.2
percent. The Big Three held 84.8 percent of the domestically
produced car market during the period.
   The mid-October sales rate last year was depressed because
consumers who planned to buy cars in the last three months of the
year purchased their cars in September to take advantage of
incentives that expired Oct. 1.
   With only a few exceptions, domestic car and truck sales this
year have been lower than in 1989. Through Oct. 20, sales fell 4.2
percent from 1989. Car sales for the year fell 4.6 percent and
truck sales dropped 3.5 percent.
   GM's mid-October car sales rose 15.1 percent from 1989, and
truck sales rose 7.5 percent, combining for a 12.4 percent increase
in vehicle sales. Through Oct. 20, GM's car and truck sales were
4.6 percent lower than in 1989.
   Ford's 9.3 percent increase in car sales combined with an 11.4
percent rise in truck sales for a 10.1 percent increase in vehicle
sales during the period. For the year, Ford's car and truck sales
were 8.6 percent behind 1989.
   Chrysler's mid-October vehicle sales rate was 6.7 percent below
1989 with a 5.6 percent increase in car sales offset by an 18.7
percent decline in truck sales. Since Jan. 1, Chrysler's car and
truck sales have fallen 14.3 percent from 1989.

<HEAD>Winnebago Goes to 4-Day Week, More Layoffs Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An economic slowdown aggravated by a
Persian Gulf oil shock has walloped Winnebago Industries Inc., and
the pain felt by the manufacturer of motor homes is being shared by
its neighbors.
   When Winnebago is in trouble, so is its home town of Forest
City, says Paul Jefson, mayor of the north central Iowa community.
Before layoffs began in late September, the company had a work
force of about 2,600 in the community of around 4,300.
   As problems began surfacing at Winnebago earlier this year the
city anticipated its tax revenues would drop off. ``It's important
that we live within the means of the city. It will affect us,''
Jefson said Wednesday.
   That means no new elaborate plans for public works, although a
sewer project will proceed as scheduled, he said.
   The problems will get worse later this week, when Winnebago
announces an austerity plan.
   The company already has laid off hundreds of workers and gone to
a four-day work week at its factories. The new retrenchment will
mean layoffs for white-collar workers, said Winnebago spokeswoman
Sheila Davis.
   Jefson says a community meeting is set for Monday night to
establish a task force to help Winnebago employees.
   An industry analyst said Winnebago appears to be taking the
right steps to return to profitability once the gasoline price
outlook and the nation's economic prospects brighten.
   Analyst Michael Sabbann, who follows the recreational vehicle
industry for the Minneapolis investment firm of Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, also said Winnebago is not alone and that other
manufacturers are in a bind.
   A Commerce Department report Wednesday said orders to U.S.
factories of durable goods, items such as appliances and vehicles
designed to last three years or more, fell 1.7 percent in
September. Transportation orders plummeted 6.8 percent.
   Winnebago, with products that sell for around $27,000 and up,
was hurting before Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and sent oil prices
soaring. It has been stung by high interest rates and an unsettled
economic climate that sapped consumer confidence
   Winnebago has reported five straight quarterly losses and had a
record $17.8 million loss in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 25 as
sales fell 23 percent from the previous year.
   In May, directors suspended semiannual dividends to
shareholders. In late September, Winnebago began layoffs and
temporary factory shutdowns. Earlier this month, it began offering
rebates to new buyers, guaranteeing to reimburse gasoline expenses
above $1 a gallon for the first 12 months or 12,000 miles of
ownership, whichever came first.
   Ms. Davis said that the rebates have not led to any noticeable
increase in sales. ``It's a little too early to tell'' about the
success of the program, she said.
   She said the company's flagship factory in Forest City and
smaller plants at Hampton and Lorimor have been on
Monday-to-Thursday schedules since last week, with 1,000 production
workers idle each Friday. The four-day week will continue
indefinitely, she said.
   An additional 500 workers were laid off since the end of
September with no plans to recall them. Later this week, an
austerity program will be announced that will include layoffs among
the ranks of some 800 office workers, supervisors and executives,
she said.
   ``Unfortunately, those are the things that have to be done,''
Sabbann said. ``The whole industry cycle has turned against them.''
   But Sabbann said Winnebago is in a good position to regain
ground once the economy improves. He noted the company's claim to
more than 60 percent of the market in sales of micro-mini motor
homes, a more fuel-efficient recreational vehicle that has taken a
growing share of the RV business.
   Robert Rollefson, a broker at the Forest City office of the
investment firm R.G. Dickinson &amp; Co. and veteran Winnebago watcher,
said the company is faced with its most serious challenge since the
early 1970s. That's when an Arab oil embargo and the first oil
price shock left the company with acres of unsold motor homes.
   Winnebago is in better financial shape today, but ``the outlook
now and the outlook then may be about the same,'' he said.
   The mood in town ``is certainly not one of joy. There's a
certain amount of despair and sadness,'' Rollefson said. But after
the initial shock, ``people will tell you - `sure, it will get
better.'''

<HEAD>Infotech May Sell Businesses; Confirms SEC Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infotechnology Inc., the parent of Financial
News Network and United Press International, has named two new top
executives to look at ways to raise cash, including the possible
sale of its businesses.
   As interim co-chief executives, Alan Hirschfield and Allan
Tessler will restructure the company to ``address FNN's and
Infotech's financial problems.''
   Cash flow at Infotechnology and FNN does not cover operating
expenses or some debts, Infotechnology said in a statement.
   ``We will be considering all available options to provide
funding needed to meet obligations and maintain and realize the
value of the FNN franchise and of Infotech's other investments,''
Hirschfield and Tessler said in a statement Wednesday.
   ``We believe that the fundamental franchise value of the FNN
service is substantial and should provide a basis for restructuring
and-or disposition of businesses that will enable the companies to
meet their obligations and move forward,'' they said.
   Infotechnology said it is renegotiating $20.7 million in loans
for itself as well as $49.5 million in loans to FNN. In addition,
both are trying to reschedule lease payments for $161 million worth
of equipment.
   Hirschfield and Tessler have been involved in several business
restructurings, Infotechnology said. Hirschfield is a former chief
executive of both Twentieth Century Fox and Columbia Pictures;
Tessler presently is chairman of International Financial Group
Inc., Ameriscribe Inc. and International Controls Corp.
   The two replace Earl Brian, who had been chief executive and who
will continue as ``non-executive chairman'' of both the FNN and
Infotechnology boards.
   On Monday, Infotechnology disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the SEC had ``issued a
formal order of investigation with respect to the company'' under
federal securities laws.
   Infotechnology spokeswoman Amber Gordon declined to say why the
company was under investigation, but said it was cooperating. The
SEC, which polices the nation's securities markets, does not
comment on any investigations as a matter of policy.
   Gordon said the investigation was unrelated to FNN's dismissal
earlier this month of C. Steven Bolen, its chief financial officer
fired for improper financial dealings. FNN's auditors, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, also were dismissed.
   At issue with the accounting firm was how FNN was reporting its
$28 million investment in a new service. Deloitte contended the
investment should have been deducted from quarterly earnings -
which would have put FNN in the red - rather than spread out over a
period of years.
   Because of the dispute, FNN has been unable to file its annual
financial reports with the SEC for the fiscal year ended June 30.
In addition, Deloitte withdrew its opinions on FNN's and Infotech's
1989 financial statements.
   Infotechnology and FNN since have hired Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
   Infotechnology owns 47 percent of FNN, which provides 24-hour
stock quotes, business news and sports information on 3,500 cable
television systems that reach more than 35 million homes.
Infotechnology also owns 97 percent of United Press International,
the wire service.

<TEXT>
   The government is ordering the automobile
industry to make cars less deadly in side crashes, which kill 8,000
people and seriously injure 24,000 others each year.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued the
complex regulation Wednesday, ending a debate among the industry,
safety advocates and bureaucrats that dragged on for a dozen years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Transportation Secretary
Samuel K. Skinner said.
   The regulation is designed to prevent 500 deaths annually. The
protections it requires would lessen the severity of chest and
pelvic injuries.
   Rules to protect against head injuries are being developed but
won't be ready for two or three years, said Jerry R. Curry, head of
the traffic safety agency.
   Also on the drawing board are standards for light trucks and
vans.
   The new regulation drew acceptance from the industry and
cautious praise from safety advocates.
   ``We expect to comply fully with it,'' said Toni Simonetti,
spokeswoman for General Motors Corp.
   The nation's largest automaker fought NHTSA as the rule
developed, contending the dummy used in crash tests was faulty. The
agency rejected GM's plea to switch to a dummy the company
designed.
   Even so, GM became more supportive after a meeting last January
between Curry and Robert Stempel, then-president of the company and
its current chairman.
   Chrysler Corp. considers the regulation ``a positive step in the
area of auto safety,'' spokesman John Guiniven said. ``We know from
our own figures that safety sells.''
   Ford Motor Co. spokesman Robert H. Munson said complying with
the rule ``in some cases may necessitate significant re-engineering
of our product lines.'' The regulation may increase car weight and
make it harder to improve gasoline mileage, Munson said.
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and Advocates for
Highway Auto Safety said the regulation was ``a long-overdue first
step.'' But they said it would be incomplete until head-injury
protections were added.
   The changes will boost the average car's cost by about $50, ``a
small price to pay for the prevention of the immense loss of life
and suffering as a result of these side impacts,'' Skinner said.
   Manufacturers can choose between two timetables for phasing in
cars that meet the standards. Either way, all new cars must comply
by the 1997 model year.
   Most probably will add padding or structural strength to doors,
and some might do both, Curry said.
   The government will use simulated crash tests to determine which
cars meet the standards. The tests will expose cars and passenger
dummies to conditions in the typical side collision, in which a car
traveling 30 miles per hour at an intersection slams into the side
of another car going 15 mph.
   As many as one-third of today's cars already meet the new
standards, said Barry Felrice, the safety administration's
associate administrator for rulemaking. He estimated that 75
percent of the remaining cars would need only door padding to
comply.

<HEAD>Report That TWA Offers to Buy Eastern Gates in Atlanta, Base in
Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. has offered to
buy more than 50 Eastern Airlines gates in Atlanta and Eastern's
aircraft overhaul base in Miami, TWA Chairman Carl Icahn said in a
published report.
   Icahn would not disclose the value of the offer, which was
presented to Eastern's creditors late Wednesday at TWA headquarters
in Mount Kisco, N.Y., The Kansas City Star reported today.
   Icahn told The Star that TWA, which lost $300 million last year
and which has been eliminating flights and employees, has about $1
billion in reserves for such a purchase.
   The offer doesn't involve planes at the Atlanta hub, the primary
flight operation of Eastern, which has been in bankruptcy
proceedings for 19 months, Icahn told the newspaper in a telephone
interview from New York.
   ``If this goes through, we'd negotiate separately with Eastern
creditors for 100 planes,'' Icahn said. ``We might buy planes
elsewhere.''
   Icahn said Eastern's creditors solicited the offer. He said
there is no deadline on the offer.
   Eastern, based in Miami, has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization since March 1989 after Machinists went on strike.
The carrier was still losing $2 million a day in its most recent
quarterly report during the summer.
   Morten Beyer, chairman of aviation consultant Avmark Inc.,
estimated Eastern's Atlanta operation, including planes, is worth
more than $1 billion.
   He said that even though TWA was ``losing money at the
operational level, they have the financial wherewithal to do this,
and the credit.''
   Icahn said Tuesday that Eastern's north-south routes would
provide a ``fair amount of synergy'' with TWA's east-west service
based in St. Louis.
   He said although TWA is cutting back in some areas, the right
kind of growth is crucial for the airline.
   ``If we can't grow, we can't survive,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Martin Shugrue, Eastern's bankruptcy trustee, said
American Airlines, America West, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines
and USAir also have expressed interest in buying certain Eastern
assets.
   He said Northwest Airlines, Pan Am and TWA have had discussions
with Eastern, and Delta has confirmed interest in buying 19 Eastern
gates in Atlanta.
   Shugrue also said that Eastern's push to get more business
travelers could help the carrier break even by February.
   Dean Breest, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said Delta had
told Eastern it was interested in acquiring some Eastern gates and
ticket counter space in Atlanta, where Delta is the dominant
carrier and Eastern is No. 2.

   The stock market showed a modest gain today,
encouraged by hopes for a resolution of the impasse over the
federal budget deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.67 to 2,511.88 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 557 up, 319 down and
460 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.10 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   A plan put forward overnight by some members of Congress raised
hopes that agreement might soon be reached on a government budget.
   That would stand to relieve an uncertainty that has been hanging
over the markets for the past month.
   Analysts agree that the Federal Reserve can't be expected to
consider any move to relax its credit policy until the budget
situation is resolved.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up &rsqb; at
52\; International Business Machines, up &rsqb; at 109; Philip Morris,
up &lsqb; at 48&rsqb;, and Coca-Cola, up &lsqb; at 45}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .42 to 171.02. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .56 at 293.25.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.15 to
2,504.21.
   Advancing issues nosed out declines on the NYSE, with 758 up,
718 down and 493 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 149.29 million shares, against 146.30
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Mitsubishi to Build New Car at Diamond-Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of
Japan will build a new series of cars at their jointly owned
Diamond-Star Motors Corp. plant in Illinois, the companies said
today.
   The companies said in a joint statement that no decisions have
been made on when production of the new cars would begin or whether
they would replace current vehicles.
   The Diamond-Star plant now makes the Mitsubishi Eclipse and
Mirage for the Japanese company and the Plymouth Laser, Eagle Talon
and Eagle Summit for Chrysler. U.S. companies make about 60 percent
of the parts for those cars.
   The joint venture, ownership of which is split evenly between
Mitsubishi and Chrysler, has been making cars since Sept. 1, 1988.
   Currently, Chrysler gets about 55 percent of Diamond-Star's
production and Mitsubishi gets the rest. The companies said
distribution of the new vehicles would be split evenly between
Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   The new generation of cars, the companies said today, would
include two- and three-door sporty cars and a four-door sedan.
Details of the vehicles were not released.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said the new cars would have
significantly more U.S.-made parts than the current vehicles.

   The stock market gave ground today, faced with
new upward pressure on oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.58 to
2,486.63 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading

   Volume on the Big Board came to 49.82 million shares at
midmorning.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than
$2 a barrel, to more than $33 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile

   Congress is moving quickly to assure that
consumers learn more from nutrition labels about what they eat, but
another food issue - fish inspection - is falling victim to a turf
battle.
   The Senate on Wednesday approved a ill on requiring food
manufacturers to list on their labels the amount of nutrients,
calories, fat and salt for most packaged foods.
   Claims like ``low salt'' and ``light'' would be clearly defined,
and disease-prevention claims would have to be government-approved.
   The bill, passed by unanimous consent, now goes back to the
House, which passed a similar version in late July and was expected
to accept the Senate's changes.
   ``Labeling will guarantee that advertising claims are supported
by the facts, and that consumers have the information they need to
make wiser choices about their health and diet,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee.
   The Bush administration in mid-July proposed food-labeling
regulations that are similar to the provisions in the egislation
and therefore opposed the bill. However, it did not threaten a
veto.
   ``The Food and Drug Administration has been saying for years
that it will revamp food labels in this country,'' said Ellen Haas,
executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, who
lobbied for the bill. ``This legislation will see to it that FDA
follows through with its commitment.''
   The House, meanwhile, virtually eliminated any chance of federal
fish inspection becoming law this year by approving a bill that
differs sharply with companion legislation passed by the Senate
giving the Agriculture Department the inspection responsibility.
   By 277-153, the House approved a bill pushed by the Energy and
Commerce and Merchant Marine and Fisheries committees assigning the
task to the FDA, which already has a limited fish-inspection
program.
   During debate, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, held up a letter from Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan and White House chief of staff John Sununu saying
they would recommend a veto by President Bush if the Senate plan
was adopted.
   ``We don't have time for a conference'' in the waning days of
the 101st Congress to resolve the differences, said Agriculture
Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, who tried
unsuccessfully to win House approval of a measure similar to the
Senate's.
   No one questioned the need for inspection. With seafood
consumption up and about 60,000 people becoming ill annually from
eating fish, even the industry wanted it.
   ``The issue is not whether we want to inspect seafood,'' said
Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La. ``The issue is whether you want the
Agriculture Committee, which may not understand the difference
between a chicken and a crawfish, to undertake that effort.''
   The Senate legislation, approved last month, gives the
Agriculture Department primary responsibility by putting the
inspection process under its wing. The department already inspects
meat and poultry.
   The Senate bill requires the FDA to set limits on the level of
contamination in fish that would be acceptable for human
consumption. It instructs the Commerce Department to monitor the
waters in which fish are caught.

   The Treasury Department sold $17.2 billion of
three-month and six-month bills at an auction today and rescheduled
a previously postponed sale of $10.0 billion of 52-week bills for
Friday.
   Both auctions had been postponed because of congressional
failure to raise the debt limit, but were rescheduled earlier today
shortly after President Bush signed legislation raising the debt
limit to $3.195 trillion through Saturday.
   The department said it had sold $8.6 billion in three-month
bills at an average discount rate of 7.20 percent, up from 7.18
percent last week. Another $8.6 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.16 percent, down from 7.22 percent
last week.
   The three-month rate was the highest since three-month bills
sold for 7.32 percent on last Sept. 24. The six-month rate was the
lowest since six-month bills averaged 7.15 percent on Aug. 1, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.44 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,818.00 and 7.53 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,638.00.
   The two auctions were put off after the debt ceiling reverted to
$3.12 trillion last Saturday. The federal debt already had exceeded
that amount.
   However, to keep within the $3.195 trillion limit, the Treasury
said the amount of the rescheduled three-month and six-month bills,
usually offered on Mondays, was lowered from $19.2 billion. The
52-week bill offering, which had been scheduled for Oct. 18, was
reduced from $10.8 billion.
   The administration has asked Congress to raise the ceiling.
   Another postponed auction, a $12 billion 2-year note offering
set for Wednesday, has not been rescheduled.

   OPEC President Sadek Boussena said
Thursday the cartel will hold a formal meeting on Dec. 12 in Vienna
to discuss the oil markets, which have been thrown into disarray by
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But Boussena said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries was doing as much as it can to pump extra oil into the
markets to make up for the loss of some 4 million barrels of
embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
   He told a news conference that the cartel was producing at its
maximum and ``sometimes to the detriment'' of the oilfields. He did
not elaborate.
   Boussena, who is the Algerian mines minister, didn't say how
much the cartel was pumping but he said it was under the production
level of 22.5 million barrels a day set last July. Analysts have
estimated September output at 22.3 million barrels a day.
   He said OPEC would likely not be able to meet demand for its oil
in mid-winter, predicting a gap of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels
a day between supply and demand. Oil companies would have to draw
down their stocks to meet the demand, he said.
   After Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the cartel suspended its
quota system to allow its members to pump as much oil as possible
to make up the shortfall in the market. The embargo on Kuwaiti and
Iraqi oil was imposed after the invasion.
   Boussena said the oil producing nations would return to their
quota system once the Gulf crisis ended.
   He made his remarks after attending an energy seminar sponsored
by the Belgian government.

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. on Thursday reported a 14.8
percent drop in third-quarter earnings partly because of a weak
performance by the company's insurance and financial services
businesses.
   For the period ended Sept. 30, profits totaled $132 million, or
$1.16 per share, on revenue of $4.5 billion. That compared with
earnings of $155 million, or $1.41 per share, on revenue of $4.4
billion in the same 1989 period.
   Income from continuing operations in Xerox's insurance and other
financial services fell 98 percent, to $1 million from 1989's $50
million. Pretax capital gains totaled $4 million in the third
quarter, compared with $207 million in the corresponding 1989
quarter.
   ``Given the adverse forces in our markets, including both the
weak pricing environment in the property and casualty insurance
industry and the turmoil in financial markets, it is important to
note that our results were essentially in line with the second
quarter of this year,'' said Stuart B. Ross, Xerox executive vice
president and chairman and chief executive of Xerox Financial
Services Inc.
   Income dropped 64.5 percent from Crum and Forster's property and
casualty and life insurance operations, falling to $27 million in
the third quarter from $76 million last year.
   Earnings from document processing, Xerox's core business,
increased 26 percent to $131 million in the third quarter, compared
with $105 million in the third quarter last year.
   While demand for business equipment was soft in the quarter,
revenue increased from rentals, service and the financing of
equipment sales, said Paul A. Allaire, Xerox president and chief
executive officer.
   Revenue from document processing increased to $3.3 billion in
the third quarter from $3 billion for the same quarter last year.
   For the first nine months, income from continuing operations
fell 22 percent, to $383 million, or $3.38 per share, on revenue of
$13.3 billion. That compared with $492 million, or $4.55 per share,
on revenue of $13 billion for the same 1989 period.

   Oil shot up more than $3 per barrel on the
futures market today, as speculators bet on war in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We've got all sorts of little talk in the market of troops
being increased in the Middle East on our side and on Iraq's
side,'' said Brian Tagler, a broker at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. ``Once again, the market is worried about confrontation.''
   Light sweet crude oil jumped $3.02 to $34.10 per barrel for
December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange
shortly after noon. January and February delivery contracts were up
$2 per barrel and later months were all up by more than $1.
   Today's early trading was a continuation of crude's rise of
$1.71 per barrel on Wednesday. That upward surge halted a sharp
slide that had knocked oil from above $40 per barrel to less than
$30 as traders responded to hints of a peaceful resolution to the
Gulf crisis.
   Traders now think they overestimated the potential for a
negotiated settlement. They have begun wondering whether crude will
move back into the $40 range or fluctuate in the $30 range.
   Crude's soaring prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August have
been rooted in war psychology, as the world has maintained an
adequate oil supply despite the global embargo or Iraqi and Kuwaiti
crude.
   ``It's not clear whether we are back in a fundamental market or
if we need to keep a weather eye out for psychological changes,''
said oil analyst Peter Beutel of Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in
Hoboken, N.J.
   As oil moved up today, so did futures contracts for refined
petroleum products and natural gas.
   Unleaded gasoline was up 7.81 cents to 93.20 cents per gallon on
November delivery contracts, with all other contract months trading
higher. Home heating oil was up 6.88 cents to 92.00 cents per
gallon on November contracts, with all later delivery months
trading higher.
   Natural gas was up 3 cents to $2.47 per 1,000 cubic feet on
Deember delivery contracts. Most other delivery months were
trading higher.

   The price of MCA Inc. stock shot
higher today on the New York Stock Exchange, one day after gyrating
wildly on a report that a big Japanese company was in no rush to
acquire the company.
   Trading in MCA shares on the exchange was halted twice Wednesday
after the Nikkei News agency reported Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. wants a ``cool-off period'' in buyout talks.
   But a top Matsushita official later called that erroneous, as
did news reports today.
   ``If anything, the indications are exactly the opposite. Things
have been going very well,'' a person familiar with the deal told
the Los Angeles Times.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted individuals close to the
discussions as saying the talks are firmly on track and could lead
to an agreement as early as November.
   By midday today, MCA stock had gained back nearly all its losses
of Wednesday, shooting up $6.37{ per share to $56.37{.
   Today's news reports did not identify anyone by name. But the
Journal said people familiar with both companies were particularly
eager to dispel any notion that the merger talks were troubled.
   It said that several sticking points have already been resolved,
including a plan to divest MCA's New York-area television station,
WWOR, which cannot be foreign-owned.
   A buyout of MCA, the parent of Universal Studios, could be worth
as much as $8.6 billion, according to reports.
   The Nikkei News report said talks with MCA officials won't
resume until mid-November, and quoted a senior Matsushita executive
as saying if the two sides can't agree on a price then, ``we are
prepared to pull out of the deal.''
   The report sent MCA's stock down as low as $48 a share from
Tuesday's close of $58.86 before exchange officials stopped trading
in the early afternoon.
   Trading was resumed, only to be halted again after Matsushita's
denial of the report prompted an excess of buy orders. MCA finished
the day at $50 a share, down $8.87{.
   ``Discussions with MCA Inc. are proceeding in an orderly fashion
and there are no new developments to announce,'' Matsushita
Executive Vice President Masihiko Hirata said.
   An MCA spokeswoman, Chris Hanson, said the company would have no
comment.
   The Nikkei News report, which didn't identify sources by name,
said Matsushita wants to let MCA's share price, which climbed above
$63 since the deal was reported in late September, ``run out of
steam before negotiating a price tag for MCA again.''
   ``MCA's asking price is still considerably higher than
Matsushita is hoping to pay,'' the Nikkei story reported. ``During
the cool-off period, Matsushita is planning to reassess the market
value of MCA in an effort to come up with a new price for the
American group, company officials say.''
   The report also said that Matsushita wants more time to look
into how MCA's broadcasting division can be separated from the
other operations to comply with federal law that prohibits foreign
concerns from owning U.S. television and radio stations.
   The report closely followed word of another potential problem
for the deal: National Park Service Director James Ridenour's
suggestion that MCA sell a subsidiary that provides food and
lodging at Yosemite National Park because park lovers were
concerned about it falling into foreign hands.
   Another difficulty posed by the proposed takeover is how to
structure the deal so that large MCA shareholders such as Chairman
Lew Wasserman and Geffen Entertainment chief David Geffen can avoid
paying taxes on their gains.

   American Airlines Inc. moved today to block rival
UAL Corp.'s $400 million purchase of Pan Am Corp.'s London routes.
   In a letter to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett, American
Chairman Robert Crandall said his company wanted to bid on the
routes, and suggested government regulators might not approve the
UAL-Pan Am deal.

international route authorities, including those to the United
Kingdom,'' Crandall said in the letter, released publicly.
   The agreement with UAL, parent of United Airlines, was announced
Tuesday night.
   Officials at New York-based Pan Am and Chicago-based UAL had no
immediate comment.
   ``We believe that the fiduciary duties owed by you and your
fellow directors to maximize value for Pan Am's stockholders and
creditors dictate that you afford us an opportunity to make a
competing offer for these assets,'' Crandall said.
   Crandall said American could pursue ``a transaction superior to
the proposed United transaction,'' but he offered no specifics.
   Pan Am has suffered big losses in recent years, and the deal
with UAL came after fruitless efforts Pan Am to find a merger
partner or buyer for the airline.
   The deal, which would give United a gateway to Europe through
London, is the carrier's second victory over American in recent
months. Shortly after reclaiming the No. 1 domestic market share
from American, United beat out American for government approval of
Chicago-Tokyo routes.
   Under the agreement, UAL would acquire Pan Am's U.S.-London
routes, except for those leaving from Miami and Detroit. UAL's
routes into London will leave from New York, Washington, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle.
   UAL will also get unused Pan Am international routes originating
in San Francisco, Washington and London.
   The deal also provides for UAL to buy gates, hangar and office
space at San Francisco and Washington's Dulles International
airport, two Boeing 747 jumbo jets and spare parts.
   The London routes currently bring about $500 million in gross
revenues.
   Earlier today, the Teamsters Airline Division also stated its
opposition to the Pan Am-UAL deal, saying Pan Am should have gotten
more money for the London routes. The union, which represents 6,500
Pan Am workers, said it planned to file a lawsuit challenging the
sale.
   ``Pan Am should have gotten $750 million to $1 billion in order
to pay off its obligations to the workers,'' said William F.
Genoese, director of the Teamsters Airline Division. ``The deal
announced by Pan Am would hurt our members. No arrangements have
been made to protect the workers.''

   Share prices closed lower on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday after a late afternoon computer-generated sell
program and a setback on Wall Street.
   However, dealers said trading was light with scant two-way
trading because of continued uncertainty over the Middle East,
broadly fluctuating oil prices, and negotiations to reduce the U.S.
budget deficit.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. said Thursday its profit rose a
modest 1 percent in the third quarter, and predicted lower
fourth-quarter earnings than last year.
   The energy, equipment and chemical company cited uncertainty in
the economy and in the industries it serves in reporting earnings
of $91 million, or 70 cents per share. That compares with $90
million or 68 cents per share for the year-ago quarter.
   Revenues in the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $3.4 billion,
compared with $3.2 billion for the year-ago period.
   ``The uncertain business environment overall, and deterioration
in some of the industries in which we do business, has begun to
impact our financial performance and is likely to continue
impacting our businesses during the balance of 1990,'' said James
L. Ketelsen, company chairman and chief executive officer.
   Farm and construction equipment and chemical businesses of
Tenneco were hurt most in the third quarter, he said.
   ``As a result, it now appears that our earnings in the fourth
quarter will not match the strong earnings we posted in the fourth
quarter of 1989,'' said Ketelsen.
   The company reported higher operating income at the Newport News
Shipbuilding facility. Income totaled $49 million, compared with
$37 million in the period last year, as a result of increased
activity and higher margins in naval shipbuilding, Tenneco said.
   In the first nine months, the company said it earned $431
million or $3.34 per common share, compared with $379 million, or
$2.88 per share, for the same period last year.
   Revenues came to $10.6 billion vs. $10.2 billion.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed modestly
lower Thursday in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting slack export demand and good harvesting conditions.
   Speculation that the Soviet Union might soon buy more U.S. corn
cooled amid reports from Moscow indicating the Soviets might not
make any more such purchases without U.S. credit.
   The Soviets are required to buy 650,000 metric tons of U.S. corn
by the end of the year to fulfill a 1 million ton agreement. But
analysts said it now appears the Soviets may not honor the pact.
   ``I wouldn't bet the rent on it,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an
assistant vice president in the grain trading division of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Dry weather in the Midwest permitted the corn and soybean
harvest to advance, and similar conditions were ideal for winter
wheat planting in the central and southern Plains states, analysts
said.

<HEAD>Polly Peck's Demise Turns Into A Dramatic Corporate Saga</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rise and fall of Polly Peck International PLC,
the conglomerate that owns Del Monte fruit and Sansui stereos,
marks one of the most traumatic corporate demises in British
history.
   After five tense weeks, and in a desperate effort to survive, a
high-flying company of the 1980s turned to the courts Thursday and
obtained help in sorting out debts exceeding 1 billion pounds, or
$1.96 billion.
   Polly Peck's Turkish-Cypriot chairman and chief executive
officer, Asil Nadir, insisted to the Financial Times that his
company was sound. He told the newspaper he was a victim of a
Greek-inspired political conspiracy and of bungling by British
investigators.
   Nadir did not return a phone call from The Associated Press
Thursday.
   The High Court on Thursday afternoon granted Polly Peck's
request that it appoint court administrators, and assigned three
accountants.
   Court administration allows for the orderly repayment of debt
either through existing operations or through the full or partial
liquidation of a company's assets. It is akin to the bankruptcy
laws of the United States.
   The High Court dismissed a rival petition filed earlier in the
week by a creditor, the National Bank of Canada, seeking immediate
liquidation of Polly Peck.
   Justice Sir Robert Andrew Morritt said granting the
administration order reduced uncertainty and offered the best
chance for creditors to be repaid in full and others to benefit.
   When Polly Peck's directors announced late Wednesday they had
decided on this course of action, they said it would ensure the
company's survival.
   The decision followed weeks of wrangling over financing with
increasingly nervous creditors, and came after Nadir failed to drum
up the money he had promised them.
   The drama began when Polly Peck suspended trading in its shares
on London's Stock Exchange on Sept. 20 after the price tumbled 55
percent in a matter of hours.
   Creditors pressed for answers because Nadir had given banks
Polly Peck shares as collateral for loans.
   The stock-price dive was prompted by news that the Serious Fraud
Office had raided the offices of South Audley Management Ltd., a
company linked to a Nadir family trust.
   Nadir, 47, has been plagued in the British press by allegations
of links to a reputed Polly Peck stock fraud scheme. The company
and Nadir, who was questioned by the fraud office on the day of the
share collapse, have denied wrongdoing.
   Polly Peck's stock had fallen sharply since August when Nadir,
who then owned about 28 percent of the company, said he wanted to
take it private, then abandoned the plan after five days. The
exchange criticized him for hastiness.
   Nadir, who since has reduced his stake to about 24 percent,
remains the largest shareholder in the conglomerate he built up
over more than two decades.
   The son of a wealthy Cypriot, Nadir came to Britain in the 1960s
and set up his own clothing business.
   Nadir, an ally of Turkish President Turgut Ozal, also developed
fruit distribution, electronics, tourism and publishing businesses
in Turkey and in the area of Cyprus which Turkey wrested from
Greece in 1974.
   In 1980, Nadir took control of an ailing British textile company
called Polly Peck and used it as his stock market vehicle for
expansion.
   It bought the Del Monte fruit operation from RJR Nabisco Inc.
for $875 million last year and Sansui Electric Co. for $135 million
in December.
   The company, which employs 17,000 people, was highly profitable
over the years, with Polly Peck's after-tax profit rising 16
percent to $268 million on revenue of $2.27 billion in 1989. Profit
more than doubled the first six months of this year.
   Polly Peck's stock was one of the best performers of the 1980s,
which helped make Nadir one of Britain's richest individuals with a
personal fortune at more than $400 million.
   But the staid British business world continued to consider Nadir
something of a flamboyant outsider.
   As the saga now stands, much of Nadir's wealth has vanished.
Polly Peck's 23,000 shareholders have no idea how much their stock
is worth.

<HEAD>Dutch Electronics Giant Announces Severe Cost-Cutting, Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philips, the Dutch electronics
manufacturing giant, said Thursday it will cut nearly 16 percent of
its worldwide staff and eliminate stock dividends because of heavy
losses and stiff competition.
   The company, which makes items ranging from light bulbs to
televisions under a range of brands, said it lost nearly $1.3
billion in the third quarter of the year and has become too fat,
bureaucratic and complacent.
   ``We have to look at our present performance compared to that of
our current competition, not compared to our past performance,''
Philips Chairman Jan D. Timmer told a news conference.
   ``Philips' sales per employee are poor compared to the
competition. We just aren't productive enough,'' he said. ``We need
more entrepreneurial activity.''
   The company will trim up to 45,000 of its 285,700 workers by the
end of next year. Timmer said that will help Philips survive
against increasingly aggressive rivals, primarily Japanese
electronics makers.
   It was not immediately clear how many of the company's
approximately 50,000 U.S. workers would be affected, but most of
the job cuts were expected to be in Europe.
   The reductions are an addition to a cut of 10,000 jobs that is
already occurring at the world's sixth largest electronics company.
   In another sign of austerity that was bound to anger Philips
stockholders, Timmer also said the company would not pay8a
dividend.
   ``It's exceptional for a company that has always cherished a
stable dividend policy not to pay a dividend. But under the present
conditions it is not justified,'' he said. The company paid a
dividend of about $3 a share in 1989.
   The dividend cut caused Philips stock to drop because of selling
by international investment funds barred from holding stock that
don't pay dividends.
   Philips' stock closed down 35 cents at $11.95 a share Thursday
on the Amsterdam stock exchange.
   Philips's third-quarter lost compared to a profit of $134
million in the same period last year, Timmer said.
   North American Philips Corporation, the U.S.-based subsidiary,
manufactures lights, appliances, audio and video products and
medical equipment under brand names that include Philips, Magnovox,
Norelco, Philco and Sylvania.
   A spokesman for North American Philips, Albert Ruttner, said it
was premature to say how many U.S. workers would be affected by the
cutback.
   Timmer did not specify in which of the 45 nations where Philips
has employees the job losses would occur, but observers believed
most of the cuts would be in Europe.
   ``Announcements will be made by some of the managers in the
countries concerned. We have left it up to them,'' Timmer said.
   Trouble for the company, formally called N.V. Phiiips
Gloeilampenfabrieken, began in the spring when shareholders
criticized former chairman C.J. van der Klugt for being too
optimistic about first-quarter results.
   Timmer, who has a reputation for ruthless cost-cutting, took
over from Van der Klugt in May after successfully pulling Philips'
Consumer Electronics division out of the red.
   The earlier cut of 10,000 jobs hit hardest at Philip's computer
division, where 4,000 jobs were eliminated.

<TEXT>
   Oil prices shot up more than $3 per barrel in
the futures market Thursday on a combination of news and rumors
that all pointed to war in the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude rose $3.17 to $34.25 a barrel for December
delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was
crude's third-biggest one-day jump in the Mideast crisis, after
rises of $3.56 per barrel on Aug. 6 and $3.37 per barrel on Oct. 3.
   Later contract months all rose $2 per barrel, the daily trading
limit imposed by the exchange, as oil regained more of the ground
it had lost in a recent slide accentuated by a record one-day fall
of $5.41 a barrel on Monday.
   ``Once again, the market is worried about confrontation,'' said
Brian Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The
recent declines had come as traders bet on the possibility of a
peaceful resolution to the crisis that began with Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Crude moved up in the morning as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said as many as 100,000 more U.S. troops could be sent to the Gulf
and CIA Director William Webster said the Middle East will never be
secure while Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is able to threaten
neighbors.
   After oil rose about $2 per barrel Thursday on those comments,
as well as a Saudi intelligence report indicating Iraq might have
as many as 500,000 troops in Kuwait, crude was propelled even
higher by wild rumors that swept the exchange.
   Traders first responded to a rumor that President Bush had given
the Iraqis two weeks to vacate Kuwait. A rally late in the day was
sparked by another rumor that U.S. troops had moved into Kuwait.
   ``That rumor circled on the pit, and we rallied for new highs,''
said Thomas Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric
Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. The rumor was eventually denied by the
Pentagon.
   As oil rose, so did futures for refined petroleum products.
   Unleaded gasoline rose 8.21 cents to 93.60 cents per gallon on
November contracts. Later contract months all rose by their limit
of 4 cents a gallon.
   Home heating oil rose 6.55 cents to 91.67 cents per gallon on
November contracts. All later contracts were up by the limit of 4
cents a gallon.
   Natural gas was up .6 cent to $2.446 per 1,000 cubic feet on
December contracts. Most later contracts were trading lower.

   The dollar rebounded on world currency markets
Thursday to recoup the steep losses posted in the previous session.
   Gold prices also advanced. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $375.80 a troy ounce,
up $2.30 from Wednesday. Later, Republic National Bank quoted gold
at $376.25, up $3.50 an ounce.
   U.S. traders were encouraged that the dollar did not lose
further ground in overseas trading after the currency fell on
Wednesday.
   As the session unfolded, a flurry of rumors swept the market
about U.S. military intentions in the Persian Gulf. Unconfirmed
reports that the United States had entered Kuwait and that
President Bush had given Iraq an ultimatum encouraged investors to
seek a safe haven in the dollar. Traditionally the dollar is viewed
as the currency of choice in times of turmoil.
   ``It was a stop-and-go market,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior
trader at the Bank of Boston's office here. ``There were constant
rumors.''
   The dollar was also supported by an agreement on the budget,
which is being fine-tuned before being put to Congress for
approval. ``The market is saying that it has a little more faith in
the whole process, in the validity of the budget,'' said Zlatko
Glamuzina, chief dealer at Banco di Sicilia.
   Lawmakers' lengthy inability to agree on a deficit-reduction
package has weighed heavily on the financial markets in recent
weeks and has diminished investor confidence.
   A rise in oil prices also helped support the U.S. currency and
gave it a particularly strong boost against the Japanese yen.
Because Japan imports virtually all of its oil, it is particularly
vulnerable when energy prices move higher.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.15 Japanese yen from
128.38 yen at Wednesday's close. But later in London, it rose to
127.35 yen, and in New York, the dollar advanced further to settle
at 128.25 yen, from 126.49 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9545 from $1.9550 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9505 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9590.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5185 German marks, up from 1.5067;
1.2845 Swiss francs, up from 1.2695; 5.0820 French francs, up from
5.0435; 1,136.50 Italian lire, up from 1,128.25, and 1.1657
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1683.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5130 German marks, up from 1.5075;
1.2765 Swiss francs, up from 1.2690; 5.0645 French francs, up from
5.0470; 1.7050 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6990; 1,132.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,128.75, and 1.1676 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1685.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $376.25 a troy ounce, up
from $371.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing
bid of $374.80 an ounce, up from $371.10 late Wednesday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold rose $2.16 to close at $373.96 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.204 a troy ounce, down from
$4.223 on Wednesday. In London, the metal was unchanged for the
third consecutive day at $4.24 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>MNC To Sell $1 Billion Credit Card Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MNC Financial placed its profitable $1 billion
credit card operation on the market Thursday in an attempt to shore
up its faltering finances.
   The move came as MNC, the parent company of Maryland National
Bank, reported a third-quarter loss of $173 million, or $2.05 a
share, after setting aside $350 million for possible credit losses.
   The $350 million loan loss provision increases the reserve for
credit losses to $791 million or 94 percent coverage of total
non-performing loans.
   MNC reported earnings of $68.8 million, or $1.13 per share,
during the 1989 third quarter.
   The company and its banking subsidiaries also have entered into
written agreements with the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, giving the regulators broad powers
in the company's operations.
   Analysts said the financial conglomerate is preparing for the
worst and taking steps to strengthen its capital positions.
   MNC is selling one of its best divisions ``so the company
survives no matter how bad things get,'' said David S. Penn, a bank
analyst for Legg Mason Wood Walker. He estimated the bank would be
able to get between $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion for the credit
card operation.
   MNC said its total non-performing loans increased 40 percent
from $602 million on June 30 to $844 million on Sept. 30. Of that
total, $450 million of the non-performing loans are related to
commercial real estate.
   The third-quarter results increased MNC's nine-month loss to
$241.9 million, or $2.91 per share, compared with profits of $192.9
million, or $2.24 per share, for the same period a year ago.
   With assets of $27 billion, MNC is the United States' 25th
largest bank in the country. It owns Maryland National Bank and
American Security Bank in Washington.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Oct. 15, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,323.6 billion from $3,325.2 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,090.4 billion from $4,092.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $819.5 billion from $822.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 4.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.9 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,307.3 billion, a 3.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,087.4 billion, up 1.9 percent, while M1
rose 5.1 percent to an average of $817.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   - The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $345 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$376 million the previous week.
   - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.9 billion in the two-week period ended
Oct. 3, up from $317.7 billion two weeks earlier.

   The stock market pulled back Thursday, faced
with revived upward pressure on oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 7 points in
the early going, was down 20.05 at 2,484.16 by the close.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
624 up, 851 down and 487 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.46 million
shares, against 149.29 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 174.26 million shares.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than
$3 a barrel, to more than $34 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Analysts said that was enough to squelch a tentative early rally
that was credited to hopes for a resolution of the budget impasse
in Washington.
   A plan put forward overnight by some members of Congress raised
hopes that agreement might soon be reached on a government budget,
relieving an uncertainty that has been hanging over the markets for
the past month.
   Analysts agree that the Federal Reserve can't be expected to
consider any move to relax its credit policy until the budget
situation is resolved.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down } at 47};
International Business Machines, down { at 108&lsqb;; Philip Morris,
down } at 47{; Ford Motor, down \ at 31}, and General Electric,
down | at 51\.
   MCA climbed 7 to 57. The stock plunged 8~ points Wednesday
before Matsushita Electric denied reports that merger talks between
the two companies had run into trouble.
   Citicorp led the active list, down \ at 11| on volume of nearly
6 million shares. In recent days the bank holding company has had
to counter wariness among investors by sharply increasing the
dividend rate it pays on a type of preferred stock.
   Among other prominent bank stocks, Manufacturers Hanover dropped
1{ to 20; Chase Manhattan \ to 11\; J.P. Morgan \ to 36|, and
BankAmerica \ to 19~.

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.09 to 169.51.

   Assets of the nation's 519 money market mutual
funds fell $673.1 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline to $414.44 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday followed a $3.76 billion increase in fund assets the
previous week when the total hit a record $415.11 billion.
   The Washington-based mutual fund trade group said that in the
latest week, assets of 255 general purpose funds fell $478.3
million to $416.30 billion, assets of 104 broker-dealer funds
dropped $205.3 million to $165.20 billion, and assets of 160
institutional funds rose $10.5 million to $102.94 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.45 percent from 7.44 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained unchanged from a week earlier
at 7.46 percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
46 days, up from 45 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.03 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.00 percent from 4.99 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.66
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.67
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.79 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.80 percent; 7.90 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and

   Avon Products Inc. said Thursday it has hired an
investment firm to advise the cosmetics company on ways to increase
the value of its stock for shareholders.
   Avon retained James D. Wolfensohn Inc. to explore a number of
options, including special dividends, regular dividend increases
and a recapitalization, said James Cox, an Avon spokesman.
   The company has been under pressure to increase the value of its
stock from Chartwell Associates, the limited partnership that has
approximately a 20 percent share of Avon's voting stock.
   Earlier this month, two Chartwell representatives quit a special
committee of the Avon board, charging that the panel appeared
unwilling to meet its goal of finding ways to increase the
company's value.
   Avon said then the committee would continue its work despite the
resignations. The firm's decision to hire Wolfensohn appeared to be
part of that plan.
   Formation of the panel was part of a truce worked out in the
spring under which Chartwell agreed not to wage a threatened proxy
fight against Avon. Chartwell's members include John P. Rochon,
vice chairman of the makeup marketing company Mary Kay; the Fisher
brothers of New York; and the Getty Family Trust.
   Avon stock rose 37{ cents to $25.25 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange Thursday.
   A 1-million-share bloc of Avon stock was sold Thursday morning.
The identity of the seller was not immediately known.
   On Wednesday, Avon announced its third-quarter earnings rose 29
percent from a year earlier.
   The company said it earned $44.6 million, or 63 cents a share,
compared to $34.6 million, 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
rose 5.9 percent to $830.8 million from $785.1 million in the same
quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Paint Picture of Dixon as High Roller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROD RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Ray Dixon used Vernon Savings Association
funds for prostitutes, beach houses, a yacht and other expensive
entertainment while watching the institution fail, prosecutors said
Thursday in his fraud trial.
   Dixon's federal trial, one of the most prominent prosecutions in
the nationwide cleanup of the savings &amp; loan crisis, began with the
government portraying Vernon's former owner as a highflying Texan
who had pleasure on his mind more often than supervising his S&amp;L's
affairs.
   ``In these instances, Vernon paid for the toys of Mr. Dixon. The
bottom line is Don Dixon didn't pay for these toys,'' said Robert
E. Hauberg, a U.S. Justice Department attorney.
   He said Dixon used the failed thrift's funds to pay for beach
houses near San Diego, a yacht anchored in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and two hunting trips to Kansas.
   But Dixon's attorney, William M. Ravkind, said investigators
have pressured witnesses into accusing Dixon of masterminding a
conspiracy.
   ``The government is saying that Don Dixon engaged in a scheme to
defraud the federal government. But this conspiracy does not
include Mr. Dixon,'' Ravkind said.
   Ravkind said he will show that Dixon didn't profit from Vernon's
failure. Dixon invested $13 million into the thrift, but was left
with a $5 million dollar personal debt, Ravkind said.
   The 38-count indictment also accuses Dixon of conspiring with
other Vernon officials to give money to several politicians,
including former House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Hauberg likened Dixon's alleged freewheeling and dealing to a
character from Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer-prize winning novel,
``Lonesome Dove.''
   ``Like Gus from Lonesome Dove, the hero figure who drove down
the cattle from Texas to Montana, when Gus turned and said, `We're
gonna do it, but we're going to have to lie, cheat and steal to do
it,''' Hauberg said.
   Hauberg said Dixon used Vernon funds to hire female escorts to
attend parties at the Solana Beach house. The women, whom Hauberg
called ``professionals,'' usually spent the night.
   Ravkind said Dixon, who plans to testify, claimed no sexual
activity occurred at the Solana Beach house.
   ``We're not going to solve the S&amp;L problem by locking up Don
Dixon and throwing away the key,'' said Ravkind.
   The witnesses who could be called to testify against Dixon
include former Vernon Chairman Woody Lemons, who was sentenced to
30 years in prison earlier this year. His sentence is the stiffest
to date for an S&amp;L officer.
   If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up to
190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5 million.
   The Dallas thrift collapsed in 1987 and requires an estimated
$1.3 billion government bailout financed by taxpayers.
   Another scheduled prosecution witness, convicted madam Karen
Wilkening, is recovering from a bout of paralysis.
   Ms. Wilkening, who allegedly supplied Dixon with prostitutes for
the parties, was hospitalized Monday suffering from the nerve
disorder, Bell's palsy.
   She is serving a 44-month prison sentence in California and was
later released to law enforcement authorities.

<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. said Thursday its
third-quarter profits advanced nearly 28 percent, but the gain was
the result of the sale of a Kentucky plant.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the huge appliance maker said
net income totaled $60 million, or 86 cents a share, up from $47
million, or 68 cents a share a year ago.
   Without the sale of the Danville, Ky., vacuum cleaner plant,
profits would have plummeted 21 percent to $37 million, the company
said. The plant is now part of a joint venture between Whirlpool
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   Revenue during the quarter grew 11 percent to $1.66 billion,
from $1.5 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, Whirlpool reported net
income of $126 million, or $1.82 a share, down 12 percent from $138
million, or $1.99 a share in the 1989 period.. Revenue totaled $5
billion, up 15 percent from $4.72 billion.
   Whirlpool Chairman and Chief Executive David R. Whitwam blamed
the decline in profits on the weakening North American economy,
which has softened the demand for appliances. He expects
industrywide U.S. shipments of appliances to be down about 8
percent for the year.
   In a separate development Thursday, Whirlpool's dishwasher plant
in Mount Sterling, Ky., packed up its last machine shortly past
noon and laid off 610 workers, the victims of slow sales in the
appliance business.
   Whirlpool had announced in February it would close the plant and
shift its operations to Findlay, Ohio.

<TEXT>
   A goup of workers from the Soviet
Union's richest coal mines defiantly formed an independent union
Thursday night, breaking with a larger miners' congress and the
wishes of Soviet officials.
   The more than 130 miners angrily denounced the protracted
debates that have occupied the 900 delegates at a congress that
claims to represent 2 million workers.
   ``It's too much to come here for four days and adopt only one
resolution,'' said Vyacheslav Golikov, leader of the Kuzbass
Council of Workers' Committees, which called the breakaway meeting.
   Organizers of the formal congress, the second since a series of
miners' strikes last year, said they still hoped to form an
independent union before concluding Friday.
   The break came the same day that Soviet Coal Minister Mikhail I.
Shchadov warned restive miners that half the nation's shafts could
close without state subsidies. Shchadov made a pitch for the
workers' loyalties and urged patience while Moscow drafts a new
plan to improve their lives.
   ``When you adopt your decision, remember that it is crucial for
us to be together, not divided,'' Shchadov said.
   Shchadov told the disgruntled miners that they should have a
wage increase and a degree of control over their own mines, but
pointedly reminded them that the state is helping keep money-losing
mines operating.
   An independent miners' union could become a potent political and
economic force in the Soviet Union with enormous influence over the
country's energy supply.
   The breakaway group - made up of representatives of mines in
western Siberia, the Kazakh republic, and the Ukraine - marched to
a hall across the street from the congress for its meeting.
   It voted to make their new union a confederation of smaller
workers' committees, most of which were formed during the strikes
that threatened to leave much of the Soviet Union without fuel in
1989.
   ``A confederation is for our future!'' one miner shouted, as
workers tumbled over each other for a chance to speak at the only
microphone.
   A confederation would allow scores of smaller unions to maintain
their own independence within an umbrella organization.
   The formation of a breakaway confederation comes one day after
the government-sponsored National Congress of Trade Unions voted in
Moscow to disband after 70 years and reconstitute itself as a
voluntary association of unions.
   A spokesman for the breakaway miners said they had no interest
in belonging to a reorganized government trade union.
   ``The old union called itself new, but it's really the same one
because its structure is the same,'' said Golikov, who has been
dubbed the Lech Walesa of the Soviet Union for his effort to create
an opposition political movement of workers.
   The Kuzbass miners, among the most radical at the congress, drew
up a draft platform for the new confederation that set out a loose
structure of grass-roots organizations, legislative bodies and an
executive committee. The rich Kuzbass region has 60 mines, most
near the town of Kuznetsk in western Siberia.
   Miners are uncertain about how far they could part from the
government in forming an independent confederation of miners'
unions.
   They said they would defer a possible new strike pending
resolution of their outstanding complaints by the legislature of
the Russian republic, now in session in Moscow.
   The 1989 miners' strikes began to protest working and living
conditions, but quickly escalated to include demands for regional
economic autonomy for the main mining regions.
   The government then persuaded the miners to return to work by
promising to meet most of their demands. But most of the promises
remain unfulfilled, an issue that hasspurred new strikes.
   Shchadov said the government hopes to pour up to $10.1 billion
into the mining regions next year to build schools, homes and
hospitals and plans to convert at least one weapons plant into a
factory for making new mining equipment, he said.
   ``Our technology is backward,'' he said, receiving one of two
rounds of applause during his two-hour speech.
   The 900 delegates in the Donetsk conference hall were generally
receptive and good humored during Shchadov's appearance. Shchadov
was shouted down by miners in July 1989, when they were engaged in
a crippling strike.

<BYLINE>Oil Rally Fuels Gold's Gains; Platinum Plunges
^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices continued to climb Thursday as the resurgent oil
market fanned inflation fears.
   But platinum prices dropped sharply, reflecting declining
Japanese investor interest and worldwide economic jitters.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures retreated,
and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $2.30 to $2.40 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for spot delivery at $375.80 a
troy ounce.
   The increase marked gold's sixth daily advance in the last seven
sessions following a plunge to a three-month low of $360 on Oct.
16.
   Silver futures settled 1.9 cents to 2 cents lower with the spot
price at $4.204 a troy ounce in lackluster trading on the Commodity
Exchange.
   Platinum was $6.60 to $8 lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with the spot price at $415.80 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said demand for gold has increased as a result of lower
prices for the metal and higher prices this week for crude oil,
which has bounced back sharply amid escalating Middle East war
rhetoric.
   On Thursday, for example, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said the United States conceivably could send another 100,000
troops to Saudi Arabia, which fed rumors of a possible U.S. attack
on Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
   ``The war drums were beating today,'' said William O'Neill, a
precious metals expert with Merrill Lynch.
   Higher oil prices could portend higher inflation, which
typically spurs investor demand for gold.
   Higher oil prices also could tip industrialized nations into
recession and reduce industrial demand for platinum, which is
widely used in automobile pollution-control systems.
   James Steel, an oil and metals analyst with the commodities
brokerage Refco Inc., said platinum also was pressured by lower
Japanese stock prices. The Japanese value platinum highly as an
investment and jewelry metal.
   In petroleum trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude oil settled $2 to $3.17 higher with December at $34.25
a barrel; heating oil was 4 cents to 6.55 cents higher with
November at 91.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 4 cents to
8.21 cents higher with November at 93.60 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in light trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting slack export demand and
harvest pressure.
   Speculation about possible Soviet purchases of U.S. corn cooled
amid reports from Moscow indicating the Soviets might not make any
more such purchases without U.S. credit.
   The Soviets are required to buy 650,000 metric tons of U.S. corn
by the end of the year to fulfill a 1 million ton agreement but
analysts said it now appears the Soviets may not honor the pact.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2} cents lower with December at $2.63} a
bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2} cents lower with December at $2.30{
a bushel; oats were { cent to } cent lower with December at $1.23}
a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 5\ cents lower with November
at $6.05{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the
third straight day, while pork futures ended mixed as the bearish
impact of lower hog prices was offset by indications of slower hog
marketings.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .55 cent higher with December
at 77.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .73 cent
higher with November at 87.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent lower to .35 cent higher with December at 53.82 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to 2 cents lower with February
at 64.85 cents a pound.

   Bank of Boston posted a $255 million loss or $3.53

Northeast economy and a weak real estate market, bank officials
said Thursday.
   For the same quarter last year, Bank of Boston reported a $125
million loss, or $1.82 per share.
   Bank of Boston last month had predicted a heavy loss of at least
$200 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
   ``That's within the range we forecast a month or so ago,'' bank
spokesman Wayne J. Taylor said of the loss announced Thursday. ``We
telegraphed this more than a month ago. It should not come as a
surprise.''
   The bank said it set aside $200 million for bad loans during the
third quarter, bringing the total loan loss provision for 1990 so
far to $450 million. That compares with a $370 million provision
for 1989's third quarter and $442 million overall last year.
   Bank officials said most of the bad loans were for real estate.
   Bank of Boston, New England's largest bank, had shown signs of
recovery earlier this year. After posting huge losses last year, it
turned a slight profit in this year's second quarter, and officials
said the volume of its bad loans decreased.
   But last month, the bank cut its dividend from 31 cents per
share to 10 cents per share, as have a number of banks.
   For the nine-month period, Bank of Boston reported a loss of
$208 million, or $3.01 per share, compared to earnings of $62
million, or 72 cents per share, for the same period last year.

any provision. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

   Consumers would pay more for gasoline,
cigarettes and beer under the deficit-reduction plan nearing
completion in Congress. But the wealthiest Americans would face
income-tax increases averaging 6.3 percent as well.
   As many as 4 million slightly less well-to-do couples and
individuals - including most members of Congress - could get a tax
cut because the top rate on their earnings, now 33 percent, would
drop to 31 percent.
   They also would get the bill's only tax break for capital gains.
It is nothing like President Bush's proposed deep cut in taxes on
capital gains, which are profits from investments. But it would
prevent anyone from paying a capital-gains rate higher than 28
percent.
   The 600,000 richest taxpayers would see their top tax rate rise
from 28 percent to 31 percent. Even those with incomes just
slightly above the $100,000 mark could lose a portion of their
itemized deductions and part of the tax saving arising from their
personal exemptions.
   The bill, whose provisions were still being negotiated and
subject to change, would raise taxes by about $150 billion over the
next five years. But for most people below $50,000 in income, the
only increase would be in consumer taxes.
   Those with incomes under $20,000 would, on average, get a tax
cut because of a higher earned-income credit, which helps poor
working families with children.
   Most with incomes between $20,000 and $200,000 would face tax
increases in the neighborhood of 2 percent although the bite on
those between $50,000 and $75,000 would be slightly less - 1.5
percent.
   The most striking difference between this bill and those of the
last decade is the disproportionately larger burden the new plan
would impose on those with higher incomes. The Joint Committee on
Taxation estimated the share of federal taxes paid by people with
incomes over $200,000 would rise from 15.4 percent to 16.1 percent.
   The bill would raise the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and the
15-cent diesel tax by 5 cents each.
   The tax on cigarettes, now 16 cents a pack, would rise to 20
cents on Jan. 1 and to 24 cents two years later. Taxes on snuff,
cigars and other tobacco would go up by 25 percent in each of those
years.
   The levy on a six-pack of beer, now 16 cents, would double.
Negotiators are deciding whether to raise the tax on liquor, now
$12.50 for a gallon of 100-proof, to $13.70 or $14. Taxes on wines,
which vary according to alcohol content, also will go up; the
3-cent levy on a fifth of table wine would rise to 21 or 25 cents.
   Fliers would pay $6 more on an average 300-mile roundtrip
ticket. The 8 percent tax would rise to 10 percent.
   A new tax would take 10 percent of the price of certain
expensive ``luxuries'' - cars, boats, planes, jewels and furs. For
example the tax would apply only to that portion of the price of
cars exceeding $30,000 and jewelry over $5,000.
   The 1.45 percent tax that finances basic Medicare coverage would
cost higher-income workers and their employers more. It now applies
only to the first $51,300 earned each year; the bill would raise it
to $125,000 or $130,000.
   A worker earning $85,000 a year, for example, would pay $1,233,
or $489 more than present law. A $50,000 earner would pay no more.
The tax is matched by the employer.
   The bill would limit the total of certain itemized deductions
that a person with income over $100,000 or a couple over $150,000
may write off. But the 3 percent limitation would apply only
against income above those levels.
   For each $10,000 of income above the target, the proposal would
reduce allowable deductions by $300. Thus, a couple with $175,000
income and itemized deductions of $35,000 would be allowed to write
off only $34,250.
   This has the effect of raising the 31 percent top tax rate for
these people to 32 percent.
   The bill also would gradually take back from the well-to-do the
tax saving realized from personal exemptions. This would result in
larger high-income families paying a higher marginal tax rate than
those with fewer children - a notion under attack as a tax on
children.
   For 1990, a taxpayer is allowed a $2,050 exemption for himself
and another for each dependent. At the 31 percent top tax rate set
by the bill, that would mean a tax saving of $636 per exemption.
   Single people would begin losing part of that $636 tax saving
once their taxable income - income after subtracting deductions and
exemptions - passes $100,000. The benefit would be lost totally
when income hits $225,000. For couples who file jointly and have no
children, the benefit would be phased out between $150,000 and
$275,000 of income.
   The effect of the phaseout would be to boost the top tax rate on
these taxpayers by one-half of a percentage point. Thus, the limit
on deductions and the exemption phaseout would raise the top rate
to 32.5 percent for a single person and 33 percent for a couple.
   A couple with two children could have a top rate of 34 percent
on part of their earnings; a couple with six children could pay 36
percent.

   CHICAGO (AP) The Chicago Board Options Exchange said Thursday it
has been cleared by federal regulators to trade stocks and other
securities instruments in addition to options.
   The approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission
effectively makes the Options Exchange the nations' newest stock
exchange. But exchange officials said they expect their first new
products to be instruments that combine characteristics of stocks
with those of debt instruments and certain futures and options
contracts.
   ``There is very strong interest in some of these products,''

<HEAD>Saturn, GM's Hope of the Future, Goes on Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s new Saturn cars officially
went on sale Thursday, but amid all the hoopla at dealerships there
was lingering worry about a souring economy.
   The last time a U.S. automaker introduced a new line of its own
cars was 1957, just before the economy slipped into a recession.
The car then was the Edsel.
   As it was 33 years ago with Edsel dealers, Saturn dealers
aggressively promoted the cars on their first day of retail sale.
On both sides of the country, dealers dueled for bragging rights on
who sold the first Saturn.
   In his own version of time travel, Brad Boeckmann of Saturn of
the Valley in Sepulveda, Calif., delivered a four-door Saturn at 9
o'clock PDT Wednesday. He reasoned that back East, Wednesday was
turning into Thursday, the official launch date for the new line of
GM cars.
   ``We figured at midnight our time, it would be 3 a.m. East Coast
time,'' he said Thursday. `So we delivered ours at 9 o'clock''
during a big party for employees, Saturn officials, bankers and
potential customers.
   The first car went to Andrew and Patricia Gibson of Saugus,
Calif. They had no trade-in.
   Paul Lockey, owner of Saturn of Clearwater in Florida, honored
Saturn's official launch according to East Coast time.
   ``We delivered one at one second after midnight,'' he said.
``The lady who bought it traded in an Oldsmobile.'' She's Betty
Terry, 45, of Tampa.
   That type of trade, however, is what GM is hoping to avoid.
Saturn officials have said they want people to buy Saturns instead
of import cars, although they concede that a majority of first-year
sales are likely to go to people who are GM customers anyway.
   Terry, a fifth-grade teacher's aide at Anderson Elementary
School in Tampa, traded in a 1985 Oldsmobile Delta 88.
   ``Basically, I wanted a smaller car and I wanted something with
better gas mileage,'' she said.
   Fuel economy has been rising on the list of priorities for
new-car buyers recently, especially since gasoline prices began
rocketing after the Aug. 2 Iraq invasion of Kuwait.
   Rising fuel prices are just part of the reason some economists
are predicting that the U.S. economy is heading into a recession.
Unemployment is up, consumer confidence down and inflation is
rising.
   The economy in the mid-1950s was facing many of the same
pressures, and the demise of Ford Motor Co.'s Edsel has been blamed
partly on the economic downturn.
   But the relatively high price of the Edsel and its design,
especially the horse-collar looking grille, shared a large part of
the responsibility for the death of the car that has come to
symbolize failure in America.
   There was no talk of failure among Saturn dealers Thursday.
   ``I think we've really got to screw up to make this fail,''
Boeckmann said. Twenty-nine Saturn dealerships were open in 10
states in the South and West for Thursday's kickoff. They received
about half of their scheduled allocations because Saturn officials
were especially strict in their quality control inspections at the
company's Spring Hill, Tenn. assembly plant.

   Delta Air Lines on Thursday joined three other
carriers in raising air fares for the third time since the Persian
Gulf crisis boosted the price of jet fuel.
   Delta said domestic fares would rise by 5.8 percent for tickets
purchased on or after Oct. 31. It blamed a doubling of jet fuel
prices for the increase.
   Northwest Airlines has also announced a 5.8 percent hike to
start Oct. 31, while Continental and Eastern Airlines also said
they would raise rates.
   Delta said its costs for jet fuel have risen 115 percent since
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and touched off a steady escalation
in the price of crude oil and its byproducts.
   ``We take this action reluctantly, but previous fare hikes in
response to rising fuel prices have fallen well short of levels
necessary to offset these increased costs,'' Whit Hawkins, Delta's
executive vice president for marketing and stations, said in a
statement.

   Struggling Unisys Corp. said Thursday it
may not return to profitability this quarter as originally expected
as it announced the resignation of its chairman, plans to eliminate
5,000 jobs and stepped-up asset sales.
   The nation's third-largest computer company also announced that
it lost $356.8 million in the third quarter, or $2.42 a share,
compared with a loss of $648 million, or $4.25 a share, in the same
period last year.
   Revenue totaled $2.4 billion, up from $2.35 billion in last
year's third quarter.
   The most recent loss was increased by a charge against earnings
of $181 million to pay for consolidations and the elimination of
the jobs through attrition, a hiring freeze and possibly ``selected
layoffs,'' said spokesman Mike Stugrin. The 1989 quarter included a
$231 million restructuring charge.
   Unisys also said it was ``very possible'' it would report a loss
in the current quarter. Unisys until recently predicted it would
return to profitability this quarter, a belief shared by several
industry analysts.
   Unisys' statement on the current quarter prompted one of the
nation's two leading credit-rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., to lower by one notch its rating of $4 billion in Unisys
debt. A lower rating means Unisys may have to pay more to borrow
money.
   W. Michael Blumenthal announced he would resign as chairman and
a member of the Unisys board effective Nov. 1. Blumenthal, who
engineered the 1986 merger of Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp. that
formed Unisys, retired from Unisys as chief executive officer April
1, turning over the office to James A. Unruh.
   Unruh, who also is president, was elected chairman to replace
Blumenthal.
   Blumenthal, the 64-year-old former U.S. Treasury secretary and
Burroughs chairman, said he was resigning because of his
obligations as limited partner in the investment banking firm
Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
   Blumenthal is co-chairman of a new international group of
Lazard, which will be based in Paris.
   Since last October, Unisys has cut more than 8,000 jobs, closed
plants and refocused product lines inherited from its predecessor
companies.
   The company, which employs about 78,000, said the new job cuts
would be made by mid-1991 and ``will affect most operating units''
but will not result in reductions in the activities by its direct
sales force, key research programs and customer support services.
   Unisys said it was looking into a broad range of asset sales to
reduce debt, which mushroomed as Unisys borrowed to pay dividends
when profits lagged in the 1980s.
   Unisys said it hired Lazard Freres and another investment bank,
James Wolfensohn Inc., to explore the sales, but it did not
disclose what assets might be involved.
   Unruh said in a statement that it would be ``difficult but not
impossible'' for Unisys to achieve its goal of reducing its debt by
$600 million to $800 million by year's end. Debt totaled $2.6
billion at the end of the third quarter.
   Unruh said the quarter's results ``reflect a weakening general
business environment and the pronounced softness of demand in the
worldwide computer industry.''
   ``Order growth in the United States continues to be weak, and
orders have slowed significantly in Europe in recent weeks,
reflecting customer concern about general economic conditions and
about the Middle East situation,'' he said.
   ``In these circumstances, it is very possible we could post a
loss for the fourth quarter, instead of the gain we expected until
very recently,'' he said.
   The restructuring launched in late 1989 wasn't sufficient to
cope with the ``changing business environment,'' Unruh added.
   Despite the slump, Unisys said its Timeplex computer networking
business, its defense unit and sales in Asia and the Pacific were
doing well. It also said cash flow had increased significantly over
last year.
   ``We remain confident of our course toward restoring the company
to profitability and reducing its debt load,'' he said.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Unisys reported a net loss
of $348.2 million, or $2.72 a share, compared with a loss of $673.3
million, or $4.75 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue
totaled $7.18 billion, up from $7.13 billion.

<TEXT>
   The former owner of a failed Dallas savings
and loan was accused Thursday of illegally diverting $18 million to
pay off delinquent loans as a way of postponing the $1 billion
collapse of the once high-flying thrift.
   Jarrett E. Woods Jr., former owner of the failed Western Savings
Association, was accused in a criminal indictment of diverting the
funds to help pay off bad loans so that federal regulators wouldn't
discover the S&amp;L was insolvent.
   The 37-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in
Dallas charges Woods with bank fraud, misapplication of bank funds,
making false ledger entries and conspiracy.
   The charges, announced in Washington by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, carry a maximum sentence of 185 years in prison and
fines totaling at least $8.2 milion or twice the loss proven by
prosecutors.
   ``We have corralled one of the biggest savings and loan bandits
in Texas,'' Thornburgh told reporters. ``The free-wheeling
lifestyle and fraudulent management practices that led to Western's
collapse helped set the trend for our national thrift crisis.''
   In Dallas, Woods was expected to surrender to the FBI on Friday
and be taken before a federal magistrate. His lawyer did not
immediately return telephone calls.
   Woods' lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Robert B. Maloney for
an order barring prosecutors from discussing the case. The judge
refused, but ordered the announcement news conference to be held in
Washington - something the Justice Department was doing anyway,
said spokesman Doug Tillett.
   Western's failure in 1986 when it was taken over by federal
regulators cost the taxpayers $1 billion, the Justice Depatment
said. A civil suit filed earlier this week by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. seeks to collect $560 million from Woods. It
accuses Woods of spending $7 million of depositors' money in the
months before Western failed.
   The thrift, which Woods purchased in 1982 with $2 million in
borrowed money, grew from $70 million in assets to $2 billion four
years later, said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins.
   Collins said the case ``can be fairly characterized as an
example of a real estate developer, Jarrett Woods, buying up a
sleepy little S&amp;L, moving it to Dallas, pumping it full of
high-cost brokered funds and and then lending the money out on
high-risk loans.''
   ``The indictment shows the great lengths that people will go to
deceive regulators,'' Collins said.
   The indictment charges that Woods diverted $16 million from a
$60 million loan for a Houston real estate deal to businessman
James Reagin, a major borrower who was behind on loan payments to
Western.
   Most of the money, plus $2.26 million that was diverted from the
sale of Western property, was used to help Reagin pay off loans so
that Western would not have to write them off as bad debts.
   At one point, Reagin was behind on loans worth $64 million,
Collins said.
   ``Just the loans to James Reagin would have likely caused the
failure of Western Savings Association,'' Collins said.
   Reagin, a Houston businessman who faces sentencing in connection
with the failure of the Glen Ellyn Savings and Loan in Illinois, is
cooperating with prosecutors in their investigation of Woods,
officials said.
   While Woods is not accused of pocketing any of the funds
diverted to Reagin, Collins said that as 100 percent owner of
Western Woods was motivated by a desire to keep regulators from
taking over the S&amp;L.
   The indictment also charges that Woods arranged for a Western
subsidiary to pay a $48,000 commission to a company that had not
earned the money. The indictment alleges the money was actually
used to pay off a gambling debt Woods owed.

   Blaming higher jet fuel costs and other factors, Delta Air Lines
and USAir Group reported losses Thursday, while UAL said its
earnings dropped 4 percent.

   For the first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, Atlanta-based Delta
reported a loss of $51.6 million, or $1.27 per share, on operating
revenue of $2.22 billion. That compared with after-tax profit of
$133.1 million, or $2.53 per share, on revenue of $2.17 billion in
the same period last year.
   ``This is the first loss Delta has had in a September quarter
since 1982,'' Thomas J. Roeck Jr., senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said referring to the busy summer travel months.
   Roeck attributed the loss to the increase in jet fuel prices
since the Iraqi invastion of Kuwait. The increase added $78.1
million to Delta's expenses.
   He also blamed softening demand and competition from Eastern,
saying passenger revenue increased just 2 percent in the quarter.
   ``If these trends continue, the company expects to report a loss
for the full calendar year,'' Roeck said.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the company set aside $10
million to be tapped if any of its competitors go out of business.
When an airline has to book a passenger on another carrier the fare
difference goes into a pool that could be jeopardized by a
bankruptcy.
   For the first nine months, Delta's after-tax profits totaled
$53.8 million, or 85 cents per share, on operating revenue of $6.6
billion. That compared with earnings of $408.9 million, or $8.12
per share, on revenue of $6.5 billion for the same period last
year.

   Arlington, Va.-based USAir Group, parent of USAir, reported a
third-quarter loss of $120.29 million, or $2.87 per share, on
revenue of $1.64 billion. That compared with a loss of $77.68
million, or $1.86 per share, on revenue of $1.53 billion for the
same period last year.
   The results included a one-time depreciation charge of $36
million for 24 Boeing 727-200 aircraft that are being phased out of
service. The company also recorded a $14 million accrual in the
quarter for merger-related costs.
   Edwin I. Colodny, USAir Group chairman and president, called the
results disappointing and said an increase in jet fuel prices were
partly to blame.
   Airline operations recorded a third-quarter loss of $111.11
million on revenue of $1.52 billion, compared with a 1989
third-quarter loss of $42.97 million on revenue of $1.44 billion.
   USAir's passenger traffic increased more than 6 percent, Colodny
said.

   United Airlines parent UAL Corp. said its third-quarter net
income slipped 4 percent, reflecting a rise in jet fuel costs and a
$30 million expense from the failed employee buyout bid.
   Those and other expenses were nearly offset by a $93 million
gain from the sale of 12 aircraft during the quarter.
   UAL posted net income of $106.11 million, or $4.87 per share,
for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with $110.86
million, or $5.11 per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Third-quarter operating revenues rose 15 percent to $2.97
billion from $2.58 billion, UAL said from its headquarters in Elk
Grove Village, Ill.
   The higher revenues were largely a function of United's
continuing route-expansion program, which also was reflected in a
nearly 12 percent increase in the number of miles flown on United
Airlines by paying passengers during the quarter.
   United's aggressive expansion program accelerated earlier this
week with an agreement to purchase trans-Atlantic routes from Pan
Am Corp. for $400 million.
   United's arch-rival American Airlines Inc. moved Thursday to
block the deal.
   For the first nine months of 1990, UAL had net income of $217.99
million, or $10.01 a share, on revenue of $8.23 billion, compared
with net income of $317.36 million, or $14.66 a share, on revenue
of $7.43 billion for the first nine months of 1989.
