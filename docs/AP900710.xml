   A judge Tuesday issued a restraining order
barring an alderman who threatened to disrupt the city's annual
Great Circus Parade from coming within 500 feet of the parade route.
   Alderman Michael McGee, censured last month by his colleagues
for threatening violence if inner city problems aren't dealt with,
warned Monday that he and members of his Black Panther Militia
planned to disrupt the parade. McGree wrote to parade organizer Ben
Barkin that parents should keep their children at home because the
protest ``could get ugly.'' He indicated the city had no right to
enjoy itself while its black community was convulsed with violence
and poverty.
   The city responded Tuesday by obtaining the restraining order
from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge John E. McCormick.
   ``The memo to Ben Barkin, in my opinion, was a threat of
violence,'' City Attorney Grant Langley said.
   The parade annually attracts 500,000 people or more who line the
two-mile route through the downtown area. It features restored
antique circus wagons, marching bands, equestrienne groups, clowns
and other attractions.
   ``We are very concerned about the potential for disruption
having an effect on the animals, frightening the animals,'' Langley
said, noting that McGee's unspecified disruption could involve
anything from mass whistle-blowing to tossing fireworks.
   Langley said the temporary restraining order applies to McGee
and five others named in the order, as well as all other members of
McGee's Black Panther Militia and anyone else acting in concert
with the alderman.
   McGee, censured by the Common Council two weeks ago, was
unavailable when The Associated Press attempted to reach him at his
City Hall office and at his home for comment. There was no answer
at those telephone numbers.
   Doris Green, one of those named with McGee in the restraining
order, read a statement at a news conference in which McGeen said
it would be an honor to be arrested while protesting at the parade.
   McGee has repeatedly criticized the city for failing to address
inner city problems. He formed the militia earlier this year and
claims it has 500 members, including street gang members, who will
take violent action if inner city problems aren't eased by 1995.
   The Common Council censured McGee June 29 after he announced he
had received a sausage-poisoning threat from a militant group,
causing a local company to recall thousands of dollars worth of
meat products.
   City officials claimed that McGee invented the poisoning threat.

<HEAD>Study Says Infectious Hepatitis Spreads More Quickly Than AIDS</HEAD>

   An infectious strain of hepatitis that can
cause several liver diseases is spread even more rapidly than AIDS
among gay men, according to a study announced Tuesday.
   The hepatitis B virus is contracted 8.6 times more easily than
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, according to a
University of Pittsburgh study published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, hepatitis B has been
pushed in the background,'' said Dr. Lawrence Kingsley, who led the
study of 1,062 gay men in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.
   The virus infects an estimated 300,000 more Americans every
year, and 5 to 10 percent of them will develop cirrhosis, liver
cancer or chronic liver disease, the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta reported.
   Studies from the early 1980s have shown 50 to 70 percent of gay
men carry the hepatitis B virus, researchers said.
   Other disease researchers said the Pitt study is significant
because it dramatically shows that the hepatitis B strain is passed
much more easily than the AIDS virus through sexual contact and
exchange of body fluids.
   ``The viruses are linked in their similar patterns of spread,
both by blood and both by sexual contact,'' said Dr. Joseph Melnick
of Baylor University in Houston.
   Dr. Rebecca Van Dyke of the University of Michigan said the
comparison of the two viruses proves what long was suspected by
doctors who have treated gay men in the 1980s.
   ``I worked in San Francisco, and we had hepatitis B all over the
place ... and we knew it was transmitted fairly quickly,'' Ms. Van
Dyke said.
   She said the emergence of AIDS has made more people aware of all
sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B, but at the
same time those at risk of getting AIDS ``may not pay attention to
other diseases'' and seek treatment.
   The B strain is the only one of five types of hepatitis that can
be prevented with a vaccine, researchers said. About 2.5 million
Americans received it in 1989, and most of them were health-care
workers, said the CDC's Dr. Miriam Alter. The vaccine was developed
by researchers who studied gay men in New York City because the
strain was so prevalent among homosexuals, Ms. Van Dyke said.
   The Pitt study also said anal intercourse puts men at a high
risk for contracting hepatitis B. Other studies have claimed higher
AIDS infection rates are linked to anal intercourse.
   Because hepatitis B ``is so easily transmitted, we're trying to
underscore the need for safer sex, the use of condoms,'' Kingsley
said.

   Western leaders gave Mikhail Gorbachev a warm
endorsement Tuesday and pledged to ``help in practical ways those
countries that choose freedom.'' The industrial powers ordered a
study of the tangled Soviet economy and drafted conditions for
sending financial aid.
   ``Prospects for fundamental and long-term economic aid could
improve if the Soviet Union comes to a substantial change in
resources from military to civilian production, and ends the
support to those states which create regional conflict,'' according
to a foreign language draft of the final communique.
   At the midway point of their three-day summit, the leaders
acknowledged recent improvements in Beijing by slightly easing
restrictions on aid to China. Japan said it intended to move ahead,
on its own, with a $5 billion loan package.
   Diplomats worked late on a controversial U.S. proposal to phase
out worldwide agricultural subsidies. There was no resolution as
President Bush and his six summit partners met for an elegant
dinner at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts.
   An administration official said the leaders would endose a joint
effort to help Brazil save its Amazon rain forests. In a goodwill
gesture to Bush, allies did not press a desire for specific goals
to reduce pollutants blamed for causing the global warming of the
environment. The United States strongly opposes such targets.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the summit talks were
held in ``an atmosphere of constructive help. As far as I can see
there were no fights. There were some disagreements.''
   But Bush told his dinner guests to put business aside. ``There
is no working tonight, no communiques, no amendments and not
language to be corrected,'' the president said. He improvised a
brief welcome, and aides said later he had left his prepared toast
in his hotel suite.
   Earlier, the leaders released a joint statement bidding goodbye
to the Iron Curtain separating Eastern and Western Europe. They
said they were ``determined to seize all opportunities to a achieve
a Europe whole and free.''
   By authorizing the study of Soviet needs, the leaders blunted
West German efforts to organize a coordinated program of direct
aid. With support from Britain and Japan, Bush insists the money
would be wasted unless Gorbachev can achieve broader reforms. He
also wants the Soviets to curtail Cuban subsidies and reduce
spending on the military.
   The leaders issued a declaration allowing any of the summit
nations to aid the Soviets on their own. West Germany has pledged
$3.1 billion in loans and there was no discussion of putting that
on hold.
   The United States is not willing to provide aid beyond technical
assistance, but it was possible the study _ to be supervised by the
International Monetary Fund and completed by the end of this year _
could lead to a more generous approach.
   No promises, though. ``Even if the study recommends direct aid
from the West, we might still say I'm sorry,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Aside from West Germany, France and Italy have spoken up for
fast aid to Moscow, and Canada is releasing some commercial credit.
Foreign Minister Joe Clark of Canada told reporters ``there will
probably be some announcements of fairly substantial action by some
countries in the next four or five weeks.''
   Looking ahead to Wednesday's wrapup communique, Bush was trying
to persuade his partners to phase out agricultural subsidies, a
linchpin to ongoing global trade talks. . ``America protects its
agriculture ferociously,'' British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd
noted. ``So does Europe, though to a lesser extent ... the Japanese
protect theirs perhaps most of all.''
   In their political statement, the leaders toasted ``the
replacement of repressive regimes in Central and Eastern Europe by
governments freely chosen by their peoples.''
   Referring to the economically troubled, reform-minded government
in Moscow, the leaders said, ``We commit ourselves to working with
the Soviet Union to assist its efforts to create an open society, a
pluralistic democracy and a market-oriented economy.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said, ``I would hope that
there would be a consensus coming out of this summit ... that
technical assistance to the Soviet Union is warranted even under
the circumstances that exist today''
   The leaders agreed: ``Each of us stands ready to help in
practical ways those countries that choose freedom, through the
provision of constitutional, legal and economic know-how and
through economic assistance, as appropriate.''
   Even in authorizing the Soviet needs study, there was brief
discord as the leaders debated which agency would lead the effort.
France's Francois Mitterrand argued that the IMF's role could
humiliate the Soviets by subjecting Moscow to the same financial
scrutiny imposed on developing countries.
   The World Bank, which is to participate in the study, issued a
statement saying the work would take at least a year to complete
and could provide useful guidance for countries considering
investing in the Soviet economy.
   The summit concludes Wednesday with a final statement and a
series of news conferences. Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife
Marilyn flew in to join the leaders for the dinner at the Museum of
Fine Arts.
   As the leaders conferred, their spouses flew to San Antonio to
tour the Alamo and other historic sites. Margaret Thatcher's
husband, Denis, the only male spouse, skipped the trip.
   In a gesture to Japan's Toshiki Kaifu, the leaders agreed to
loosen restrictions on aid to China, in recognition of its slight
easing of repression. Summit countries pledged to explore whether
new World Bank loans ``would contribute to reform of the Chinese
economy, especially loans that would address environmental
concerns.''
   On the other hand, the summit refused to lift Western sanctions.
``We will keep them under review for future adjustments to respond
to further positive developments in China,'' the political
communique said.
   Marking recent developments in Moscow, the statement said: ``We
welcome the intention of the Soviet Union to move towards a
democratic political system, as well as Soviet attempts to reform
their economy along market principles.''
   The Western statement coincided with Gorbachev's success this
week in reshaping control of the Communist Party in ways that will
bolster newly elected officials and give the 15 Soviet republics a
bigger share of power.
   Turning to Eastern and Central Europe, where Soviet control is
being supplanted by reformist governments, the leaders welcomed
``the replacement of repressive regimes'' but singled out Romania
for lagging behind.
   Fitzwater said this was one summit where the leaders were
wrestling with the main issues themselves, not just ratifying the
work of their diplomatic ``sherpas'' and other summit aides.
   ``The language that you see in the final communique on those
issues I think will be more a product of the actual summit debate
than what we've seen in many of these former years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Little Blue Hippo Sets Record for Egyptian Relic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small 3,500-year-old pottery hippopotamus has
sold for $955,600, a record auction price for an Egyptian antiquity.
   The 4.25 inch-long hippo is glazed in turquoise and has lotus
blossoms and a grasshopper painted on its back.
   Sotheby's auctioneers said only six others like it are known.
   London dealer Robin Symes bought the artifact on Tuesday. It was
sold by Antoinette Schuster, a descendant of the late Marion
Schuster, a Swiss collector.
   The previous top price for an Egyptian antiquity was $742,500,
for a granite figure of the goddess Sekhmet auctioned in 1986.
   The hippo was found in 1907 at Abydos by John Garstang, an
English archaeologist. It was later owned by a clergyman, the Rev.
William MacGregor, who had paid 100 pounds (then $500) to become
one of 10 patrons of the excavation.
   Hippos appear only in tombs of the Middle Kingdom period between
2040 and 1650 B.C., and their purpose is not known.
   Some scholars believe they symbolize rebirth or that they were
simply intended to give pleasure in the afterlife.

<HEAD>Louisiana Abortion Ban Could Prompt Reconsideration of Roe vs.
Wade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Louisiana legislature's abortion ban, if
signed into law, may provide the test that prompts the Supreme
Court to reconsider its 17-year-old Roe vs. Wade decision, say
advocates on both sides of the abortion debate.
   Anti-abortion and abortion rights groups were waiting for word
from Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer on whether he will sign or veto
the bill passed overwhelmingly after a tumultuous weekend
Statehouse battle.
   If it becomes law, the measure would be the nation's strictest
anti-abortion law and would represent a direct challenge to the
1973 Roe decision in which the court declared abortion to be a
constitutional right.
   ``There's no question that this is a great bill for us,'' said
John C. Willke of Cincinnati, president of the National Right to
Life Committee, the leading anti-abortion group.
   ``This will stop 99 percent of all baby killing in the state of
Louisiana,'' Willke said. ``It certainly is a signal to the rest of
the nation.''
   The bill was passed overwhelmingly Sunday night after abortion
foes failed to override Roemer's veto of an even stronger abortion
ban. The new bill includes provisions, demanded by Roemer, to allow
abortion in cases of reported rape and incest.
   However, the governor said Monday he hadn't decided whether to
sign or veto the latest version.
   National abortion rights groups were stunned by the sudden
emergence of the revised bill.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, called it ``the most outrageous and dangerous
anti-choice bill in the nation'' and urged Roemer to veto it.
   Roger Evans, director of litigation for Planned Parenthood, said
his group will file suit to block the measure if Roemer signs it.
   ``I don't see how the Louisiana law could get to the Supreme
Court without forcing a frontal confrontation with Roe v. Wade,''
he added.
   Dawn Johnsen, legal director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said the Louisiana bill ``could be upheld only if
the court were to overrule Roe and deprive all women of the right
to choose.''
   Other recent cases before the Supreme Court involved more narrow
restrictions, such as requiring parental notification when minors
seek an abortion and limits on where and how they could be
performed. The decisions in those cases chipped away at Roe without
directly addressing it.
   State legislatures considered a number of anti-abortion bills
this year after the Supreme Court's 1989 Webster decision gave
states the authority to impose some restrictions.
   Idaho was the only other state to pass a bill as strict as the
Louisiana measure, but it was vetoed by Gov. Cecil Andrus. Guam, a
U.S. territory, also has passed an abortion ban, but it has been
blocked by the courts.
   Willke said he expects the Louisiana measure, if enacted, to be
challenged in court and blocked during appeals.
   ``Then it will go to Supreme Court, and that's two years from
now, and our guess is by then we'd have big, broad smiles on our
faces,'' he said.
   Willke said he believes the court's current membership would use
a case involving the Louisiana measure to strike down all or part
of the Roe decision.
   But he said the court's makeup could change by the time the case
is heard, and predicted that could shift the decision even more in
his group's direction.
   However, Planned Parenthood's Evans said his group believes the
currently divided court would stop short of reversing its decision
on abortion. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is considered the pivotal
vote in any abortion case.
   Johnsen, in a written analysis of the Louisiana bill, said the
rape exception was too narrow because it requires a victim to
report the attack within seven days.
   She said it goes further than the Idaho bill by imposing prison
sentences of up to 10 years for doctors performing abortions, and
said it could lead to prosecution of women who self-induce abortion.

   Mel Blanc, the voice of Porky Pig, Bugs Bunny
and legions of other cartoon characters, put the same signature on
his life as he did on his work, says his son, who had the famous
words engraved on a new tombstone.
   ``That's All Folks,'' reads the 5-foot white marble monument at
the Beth-Olam Cemetery, near Hollywood's Paramount Studio.
   Those were ``the last words he ever said on-camera or
off-camera,'' Blanc's son, Noel, said Monday.
   The headstone was set in time to mark the first anniversary of
his father's death on July 10, 1989, Blanc said.
   The elder Blanc delivered the daffy Looney Tunes sign-off,
``That's All Folks,'' while filming a commercial for Buick
automobiles with Noel when he was stricken and rushed to
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   He died about two months later at the age of 81.
   Blanc was the voice who gave life to hundreds of cartoon
characters, including Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, Sylvester the Cat
and other Warner Bros. creations.
   Even now, ``My dad is heard by 250 million people every day all
over the world,'' Blanc said. ``They figure that somewhere you can
turn on a television and hear him.''
   The younger Blanc has carried on his father's tradition, and
recently recorded Bugs Bunny singing ``Happy Birthday'' greetings
to more than 1,400 different names for a computerized 900 telephone
service.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``Nobody ever will be able to do what he
has done. He created more than 1,500 voices.''
   The new headstone reads:
   ``That's All Folks
   Mel Blanc
   Man of a Thousand Voices
   Beloved Husband and Father

<HEAD>Ex-Senator's Third-Party Bid Favored in Connecticut Governor's
Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Both the Democrats and the Republicans
are underdogs in the Connecticut governor's race this year. Voters
seem smitten with the third-party campaign of a maverick ex-senator
they ousted from office just 1{ years ago.
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr. narrowly lost his bid for a fourth Senate
term in 1988 but roared back onto the state's political scene in
March, forsaking the GOP and declaring his candidacy as an
independent.
   Poll after poll has found Weicker to be the frontrunner in the
gubernatorial race, far ahead of the two congressmen who are
expected to claim the Republican and Democratic nominations.
   But Weicker _ who created his own party, the Connecticut Party _
discounts the polls. He remembers 1988, when he was favored for
re-election to the Senate and lost by 10,000 votes to Democrat
Joseph Lieberman.
   G. Donald Ferree Jr., director of polling at the University of
Connecticut, said Weicker is riding almost 20 years of statewide
support, but he predicts the race will tighten as the candidates
stake out positions and become better known.
   ``Because (voters) aren't hearing much and because Weicker has
such a strong advantage in terms of familiarity, there's been very
little movement,'' Ferree said. It would be a mistake to interpret
the current numbers as ``hardened preferences,'' he said.
   This is the first time in 20 years that Connecticut Democrats
aren't favored to win the governor's office. The party is
foundering after Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill was forced to
raise taxes by more than $1 billion last year.
   O'Neill, citing ``political realities'' and saying he had no
stomach for a nasty campaign, in March dropped plans to run for
re-election.
   The Democratic frontrunner now is four-term Rep. Bruce A.
Morrison, who was challenging O'Neill for the nomination. The day
O'Neill dropped out, little-known state Rep. William J. Cibes Jr.
announced he was jumping in.
   Morrison is expected to receive the party's endorsement at the
nominating convention this weekend. But Cibes appears assured of
getting the 20 percent of convention delegates needed to force a
September primary.
   Many O'Neill Democrats have been cool to Morrison because of his
challenge to the incumbent Democrat. O'Neill himself remains openly
resentful, questioning Morrison's ability to win and refusing even
to meet with him.
   Republicans, who have won the governor's office just once in 35
years, had thought 1990 would be their year. The party saw O'Neill
as vulnerable on tax and budget issues and believed Morrison would
be an easy target too, because of his liberal voting record in
Congress.
   In their own candidate, three-term Rep. John G. Rowland, the GOP
saw a brash young congressman who had won in a Democratic district
and looked like the right new face. Rowland is poised to accept his
party's nomination by acclamation at its July 20-21 convention.
   What the GOP didn't count on, though, was Weicker's candidacy.
After his 1988 Senate defeat, Weicker said he was leaving politics
with ``no regrets, no excuses, no blaming, no griping and no
comebacks.''
   In announcing his gubernatorial campaign, Weicker said he was
getting back into politics because ``I miss, very frankly, fighting
for Connecticut.''
   Weicker, who made a brief bid for the Republican presidential
nomination in 1979, was forever battling the party during his years
in the Senate. He took on Richard Nixon during Watergate, and
Ronald Reagan later in his career. And he was always on the outs
with the state's GOP hierarchy.
   He says he bolted the Republican Party because 20 years of
trying to lead by example didn't work.
   ``If I was going to run for governor, it wasn't going to be a
philosophical debate with the Republicans,'' Weicker said. ``I've
had that. What I wanted to spend my time on was the state of
Connecticut.''
   Weicker's candidacy seems to be hurting Rowland the most. The
former senator has picked up endorsements from several prominent
Republicans, including Mary Boatwright, a member of the Republican
National Committee.
   A recent Weicker fundraiser in Washington featured some of his
former Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle, including
former GOP senators Paul Laxalt of Nevada and Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts and incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa.
   Morrison and Rowland both say they could spend $4 million or
more on the race. Weicker, who doesn't face the traditional need to
court delegates and who has no need to boost his name recognition,
hopes to get away with half as much.
   Ferree's most recent poll had Weicker favored by 41 percent of
those surveyed, Rowland with 11 percent and Morrison with 9 percent.

   All officers of the East German army will be
required to swear allegiance to democracy, replacing their previous
oath of loyalty to Communism, the country's defense minister said
in an interview published today.
   Swearing-in ceremonies will take place throughout East Germany
on July 20, Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann was quoted as saying
by Die Welt, a West German newspaper.
   The swearing-in ceremonies coincide with the 46th anniversary of
an attempt on the life of Adolf Hitler by Col. Claus von
Stauffenberg and other German army officers. Hitler was slightly
injured in the bomb attack, and most of the conspirators were
executed.
   Eppelmann said soldiers in the National People's Army are
already swearing loyalty to democracy instead of the ``workers' and
farmers' state,'' as East Germany called itself until the
Communists were deposed last fall.

<HEAD>Catholic Parents Group Says Homosexuals Should Wear Visible ID</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Catholic parents in
Queensland state homosexuals should be required by law to wear
visible identification and be counseled on ``the depravity of their
actions.''
   The call for ID cards for homosexuals is part of a 10-point
program presented Monday by the Queensland Association of Catholic
Parents as ``modern minimum health precautions'' to help stop the
spread of AIDS.
   The group does not have church backing.
   AIDS activists criticized the ID proposal, saying it highlighted
the failure of AIDS education to have a significant impact on the
general population.
   ``Why don't we just go back to Nazism and put a tattoo on our
heads?'' said John Bonello, AIDS Council project officer for
Townsville.
   The Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland will hold public
hearings on homosexual law reform during the next few months.
   The Catholic parents' group program was described in a 50-page
document submitted to the commission on Monday.
   Michael O'Dowd, the association's secretary, called on the state
government to maintain existing anti-homosexual legislation. He
described moves to decriminalize prostitution as ``stupidity in the
extreme.''
   O'Dowd did not say how many people belong to his organization,
but claims it represents ``quite a large group of parents who want
to keep traditional moral standards current.''
   The association's other recommendations included quarantining
AIDS carriers, compulsory AIDS testing of all male flight
attendants and known homosexuals, banning homosexuals from teaching
positions and jobs involving food handling, and requiring hotels
and restaurants to use disposable crockery and cutlery.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. There is no known cure.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The U.S. Surgeon General has reported that casual social contact
will not transmit the AIDS virus, nor has the disease been
contracted from eating in restaurants or sharing eating utensils.

   Perhaps it's fitting: the headquarters for the
economic summit's host committee is a historic mansion now owned by
the government as a result of the S&amp;L debacle.
   Houston is in the heart of the thrift crisis, home to $668
million in real estate dumped on federal agencies. But President
Bush, who might be considered chief landlord for all the empty
office space and dilapidated storefronts, isn't showing off any of
these acquisitions to his economic summit friends.
   There aren't any summit parties at the skating rink the
government is trying to sell. Nor are there any summit-related
services scheduled at the athletic club-turned church on the roll
of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with
selling $141.6 billion worth of assets acquired in takeovers of
failed S&amp;Ls.
   Summit guests aren't making use of the hotels the government
owns in Houston, including the Comfort Inns. Dinners aren't
scheduled for RTC restaurants, and no black-tie billiards matches
at the government-owned pool hall. Even office space near Rice
University, site of the summit meetings, remains unused.
   And it's doubtful the convenience stores now in government hands
would be of interest to the Japanese delegation, even though a
Japanese company recently agreed to take over Dallas-based
Southland Corp., owners of the 7-Eleven chain.
   Houston has nearly 9 percent of all the S&amp;L properties in the
RTC's inventory, agency spokeswoman Theresa McCusic said.
   So far, 43 S&amp;Ls in the area have failed, and at the end of
April, more than 3,100 RTC properties in the city were for sale.
   ``The Houston regional office is the largest one we have'' in
the Southwest, she said.
   Downtown, several high-rise buildings are available through the
RTC, including a 61-year-old bank building which, ironically, has a
message of more conservative banking days chiseled in stone over
the entrance: ``Frugality is the mother of the virtues.''
   Near Rice University, a three-story office building might have
been available for meetings of the Western leaders, but the RTC
catalog notes ``numerous problems, e.g. parking, HVAC (heating and
air-conditioning), asbestos, fire sprinklers, electrical.''
   The Kirby Mansion is in far better shape, stately and
well-manicured. Unlike many of the other Houston area S&amp;L
properties, it has a tenant. The mansion has been the headquarters
of the Houston Economic Summit Host Committee, a fundraising and
planning group that made summit arrangements.
   ``I think it is a good thing (for the RTC). It gives this house
visibility,'' said Peter Roussel, a spokesman for the host
committee.
   The 36-room mansion, the last mansion in downtown, was built in
1892 by a lumber, oil and banking magnate named John Henry Kirby.
The house has entertained four presidents, including Bush. From
1978 until last year, it was the headquarters of an oil company,
which fell on hard times.
   ``It makes a statement about Houston's history and heritage,''
Roussel said.
   And it makes a statement about present-day Houston as well.

   Special agents, armed with stopwatches instead
of guns, are trying to clean up the city.
   The eight agents hit the streets Monday in a new effort to clear
the air by enforcing a 1972 law against car, bus and truck drivers
who leave engines idling for more than three minutes.
   It's part of Mayor David Dinkins' plan to let New Yorkers
breathe easier.
   ``Nothing else that we can do will bring us an improvement in
our air quality faster than obtaining general, citywide compliance
with the three-minute idling law,'' Dinkins said.
   Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Tina Casey
said eight tickets were issued on the first day, including four at
the Jacob Javits Convention Center. All eight went to buses, she
said.
   ``Needless to say, we're thrilled at the small number of tickets
that we had to issue,'' she said. ``They must have gotten the
message.''
   Around noon Monday at a parking lot crowded with buses near the
convention center, a group of drivers said they weren't happy with
the city's enforcement plans.
   ``It's like an oven in there,'' said Terrence McIntosh, a driver
for Short Line of Mahwah, N.J., pointing to his bus. With the
temperature near 90, he said his passengers were not going to be
happy to get into a hot bus.
   The drivers also complained that the fines _ which they, not
their employer, would have to pay _ were too high.
   First offenders will get a ticket for $220 and the fines can go
up as high as $880 for repeat offenders.
   ``That's just a little less than what we make,'' said Cruz
Quintana, another Short Line driver. His company pays about $360 a
week to starting drivers, he said.
   Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio called the
penalties ``commensurate with the violation.''
   ``We mean business,'' Riccio said.
   Riccio said that if the operator of a ticketed vehicle is not
the owner, then the owner also is subject to a fine.
   ``We're talking about the air that we breathe and the
environmental and health impacts of that,'' Riccio said. ``If
people want to be selfish and leave their vehicles running, then
that means that other people suffer.''
   The law does not apply to vehicles that need the engine to
operate some equipment, such as a truck mixing concrete.
   Richard Mendes, deputy DEP commissioner, said more than 200
summonses have been issued annually in the past for idling
violations.

<HEAD>No Consensus in Congress for Ending Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Summit Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

   Some members of Congress say they would go
along with cutting subsidies to American farmers if President Bush
persuades the Europeans to reciprocate. But others favor even
stronger government supports as a defense against cheap imported
food.
   And Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas doubts the issue
will be forced upon his colleagues, even as it is a major topic on
the agenda of the seven Western leaders at the economic summit in
Houston.
   ``I would guess they aren't going to do much,'' Dole said,
citing pressures on the Europeans at home to maintain the current
system.
   But Dole, who would like to see subsidies reduced, said it is
important that the issue is at least being raised.
   ``Give us the same markets, same opportunities, we'll win our
share,'' he said of U.S. farmers' ability to compete in the world
market.
   The government spent about $11 billion this year in subsidies
that assure a certain income to producers of wheat, corn, soybeans,
cotton and rice. Other government programs maintain the prices of
products such as honey, wool, mohair, tobacco, and sugar without
direct payments, but through market manipulation.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said no consensus exists in
Congress on changes in the farm policy.
   ``But I think that most Agriculture Committee members recognize
if the European countries and the others agree to reduce their
subsidies over 10 years, that would be a position that would draw
broad support in the Congress,'' said Panetta, who is chairman of
the House Budget Committee and a member of the Agriculture
Committee.
   In fact, farm legislation already approved by the House and
Senate agriculture committees freezes subsidies which, considering
inflation, has the effect of reducing income supports over the
five-year life of the bill.
   And, a coalition of House members is preparing for a floor fight
to eliminate even more taxpayer-supported farm programs.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is leading that coalition,
said it would be best if all nations eliminated subsidies that
distort world trade.
   ``It is clear that some of the export subsidies in the United
States should be eliminated now,'' he said. ``The Bush
administration is taking the right approach, but it is an approach
that also needs to be extended to the legislative arena.''
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., takes an opposite view. He says the
United States should use the same approach in agriculture as in
arms negotiations _ deal from a position of strength.
   ``Congress on both sides of the aisle would love to get an
international agreement to reduce subsidies,'' said Kerrey. ``First
of all, start with a strong overall five-year farm bill.''
   He led senators on the Senate Agriculture Committee who wanted
to increase farm income supports, and is a strong supporter of the
use of the export programs designed by Congress to bring down the
price of U.S. farm products in the world market.
   Kerrey says President Bush's proposals for the farm bill would
weaken the U.S. farm economy, sending the wrong signals to the
Europeans.
   ``Unless he (Bush) assumes the Europeans can't read. They're
saying the United States is not going to play that tough with us,''
said Kerrey.
   Dole said the farm bill had a log way to go before it could be
viewed as specific signal to the Europeans.
   ``I don't think it says very much at all. We haven't agreed yet
on the contents. There still is going to be a battle on the
floor,'' said Dole. ``I think the fact that it's a five-year bill
says we are going to continue subsidies.''

   Here are quotations from officials of the seven
nations which opened their annual economic summit on Monday:
   President Bush, on the goals of the summit:
   ``A new world of freedom lays before us. Hopeful. Confident. A
world where peace endures, where commerce has a conscience and
where all that seems possible is possible. So let us begin, in good
faith, to set the stage for the new millennium.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, on drawing Moscow into the
Western economic system:
   ``It should be in all our interests if the Soviet Union is more
strongly tied into the international division of labor. That also
means connecting them to the international economic organizations
and financing institutions.''
   Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, on helping the Soviet
reform effort:
   ``There is a need to create structures so the Soviet Union will
overcome its problems.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on the importance of
settling trade disputes:
   ``The touchstone this time will be our attitude to trade.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand, on the urgency of helping
the Soviets:
   ``If we don't decide now to help the Soviet Union, there is a
risk that there will be no progress, no further reform.''
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark, on Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's letter to Bush before the summit started:
   ``What the president of the Soviet Union is asking is for the
opportunity to have leaders of his economy and government sit down
with experts from the West to discuss how in practical, sustainable
ways the West can help reform the economy of the Soviet Union.''
   Japanese Foreign Ministry director of European affairs Takehiro
Togo, on Tokyo's plans to resume lending to China:
   ``We don't think this is something that requires a consensus of
the other members. We will decide this on our own.''

   Foul-mouthed comedian Andrew Dice Clay
sparked another late-night television boycott, this time on ``The
Arsenio Hall Show,'' it was announced Monday.
   Starr Parodi, the keyboard player in Hall's house band, refused
to perform in Tuesday's show featuring the stand-up comic.
   ``As an employee of `The Arsenio Hall Show,' I cannot show my
disapproval of Clay by turning the channel, but I can refuse to
play in the band, which is a function I have performed for every
guest that has appeared ... to date,'' Parodi said.
   Clay, who is on the talk-show circuit to promote the Wednesday
opening of his feature film ``Ford Fairlane,'' is known for his
expletive-laden routines that contain vulgar references to women,
homosexuals and minorities.
   Upon hearing about the boycott, Clay said it was all a mistake
and that he believed Parodi would decide to appear.
   ``It's a goof,'' he told an Associated Press reporter. ``She'll
be there. Believe me, she'll be there. That girl is crazy is about
me.''
   A planned appearance later this week on CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' has sparked no protest so far, said network spokeswoman
Alison Hill.
   His appearance as a guest host on Saturday Night Live two months
ago prompted a walkout by cast member Nora Dunn and a last-minute
cancellation by Irish pop star Sinead O'Connor.
   Several groups also have vowed to picket the opening of ``Ford
Fairlane'' to protest the comedian's routines.
   Parodi's boycott of the Hall show will consist of the musician
refusing to leave her dressing room during Tuesday evening's
taping, according to Hall's publicist. The syndicated program is
televised at 11:00 p.m. in most U.S. cities.
   Parodi said she believed Clay was entitled to express himself on
television, but ``as a matter of fact, his material offends me.''
   Asked why Hall, who is black, would put the allegedly racist
comedian on his show, publicist Dana Freedman replied, ``It is
Arsenio's opinion that banning a comedian from his show...is not
the way to handle the situation. Rather his preference is to deal
with the comedian's attitude head on.''

<HEAD>President's Son Says Probe Makes Him a `Political Football'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president's son, Neil Bush, contends he has
been made a ``political football'' in the investigation of his role
in the failure of a Colorado savings and Loan.
   In a series of newspaper interviews, Bush contended he had done
nothing wrong in connection with the failure of Silverado Savings &amp;
Loan.
   Bush conceded in an interview published in The Washington Post
on Tuesday that he got ``an incredibly sweet deal'' in the form of
a $100,000 loan from a Denver investor that he wasn't required to
repay. But he said the loan was ``totally unrelated'' to his work
as a director of Silverado.
   Federal regulators have accused Bush of conflict of interest
while a Silverado director from 1985 to August 1988. Silverado was
seized by regulators in December 1988 and bailing it out is
expected to cost $1 billion in tax money.
   The allegations against him by the Office of Thrift Supervision
will be aired before an administrative law judge in Denver on Sept.
25.
   In an interview published over the weekend in The Denver Post,
the younger Bush complained that the administrative charges against
him are being pursued in a highly political atmosphere. Republicans
and Democrats seek to blame each other for the savings and loan
disaster, and the case against the president's son provides
ammunition to the Democrats.
   The younger Bush said Silverado was ``doomed to die'' before he
became a director because it carried $1 billion in commercial real
estate loans at a time the Colorado market was faltering.
   Regulators say Bush failed to disclose a series of business
deals with developers Ken Good and Bill Walters who defaulted on a
combined $130 million in loans from Silverado.
   Good loaned Bush $100,000 in 1984, but forgave the loan before
Bush joined the S&amp;L's board, Bush told The Washington Post.
Regulators say Bush proposed to his fellow board members that they
grant Good a $900,000 line of credit.
   Bush told the paper that since he got the loan, the money ``was
basically forgotten ... it's been dormant.''
   Bush told The Washington Post there was no conflict in his vote
to approve Silverado loans to Walters, who had in interest in
Bush's oil business. He said he failed to mention his business
connection with Walters on required conflict-of-interest forms, but
said other Silverado officials knew of his ties.
   ``I'm sure there was a disclosure...,'' he told The Washington
Post. ``That was looked into by legal counsel.''

<TEXT>
   Coal lobbyist John Harman recently sat down
with Treasury tax official Kenneth Gideon and tried to convince him
that new energy levies would be a bad idea.
   The only response Harman got was a poker face.
   He didn't really expect Gideon to take a position on energy
taxes, now that President Bush has conceded that budget negotiators
must find new taxes to reduce the deficit.
   In fact, budget negotiators say the imposition of taxes on a
broad range of fuels hasn't yet come up during their talks, which
resume today. But for Harman and other interest groups, the
lobbying battle is on already.
   They've been buttonholing administration officials and members
of Congress involved in the talks, deluging them with letters,
petitions, studies, newspaper articles and other tools of
persuasion.
   The brewing fight over energy taxes is a case study of the
dozens of tax and spending issues that budget negotiators must
decide. At stake are painful choices over who will pay for $50
billion in savings being sought for next year.
   ``We want to avoid these taxes, and it would be almost too late
already if it comes out of the budget summit,'' said Monica
McGuire, tax director for the National Association of
Manufacturers. Her group, which has organized a coalition of
industries opposed to energy taxes, has conducted a study that
claims such taxes could add up to $20 billion a year to the deficit.
   The National Coal Association is trying to rally opposition to
new fuel taxes among coal state lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The
Edison Electric Institute, representing the nation's electric
utilities, is urging Bush and the budget negotiators to reject new
taxes based on fuel emissions.
   Institute lobbyist Judy Boddie and her allies say higher fuel
taxes would hinder U.S. competitiveness, cost jobs and worsen the
deficit by slowing the economy.
   On the other side of the issue, the National Wildlife Federation
is urging its 78,000 members to write to Congress in support of
carbon fuel taxes. It also is circulating a petition among other
environmental groups, which will be given to participants in the
budget talks.
   ``On behalf of our more than 8 million members we urge your
support of carbon emission fees as an environmentally responsible
way to reduce the federal budget deficit,'' a draft of the letter
says.
   Members of Congress also are getting in on the lobbying act.
Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who represent
states that would be hit hard by energy tax increases, have gotten
35 senators to sign a letter to Bush opposing new energy taxes.
   ``Look at the politics,'' said Conrad. ``There's a chance to
sell it as a pollution fee and dodge the tax bullet. It could come
up at the last minute and develop a life of its own, and then
become part of a package and be far more difficult to defeat.''
   At least two types of broad energy taxes are being proposed.
   One would base the tax on the amount of carbon _ an air
pollutant _ in the fuel. It would tax coal, petroleum and natural
gas but leave nuclear, hydroelectric and solar energy untouched
because they contain no carbon.
   Bargainers say the Bush administration and some Republican
congressional leaders prefer a tax based on the amount of energy _
measured in British thermal units _ that a fuel contains. The
so-called BTU tax would apply to all fuels and is believed to have
a better chance of adoption.
   Budget negotiators say the lobbying is not likely to have a
dramatic effect on their work.
   ``The members of the budget summit have a pretty good feel for
where the hot spots are,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta, D-Calif., one of the bargainers. ``I'm not sure the
lobbying is going to change those viewpoints.''

<HEAD>Postal Plan Announced for Contracting Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 12,000 mail sorting jobs at the
post office could be shifted to private companies by 1995 under a
plan announced by the U.S. Postal Service.
   The change could save the mail agency $4.3 billion over 10
years, Assistant Postmaster General Peter Jacobson said Monday.
   He said that hiring private firms to do specific sorting jobs
could cut postal costs by $10 to $12 an hour per employee.
   The announcement, though described as preliminary, comes as the
agency faces contract negotiations with its major unions. The
Postal Service also has a proposal for a rate increase pending.
   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union,
quickly denounced the announcement as a ``disgrace.''
   ``They will do nothing with this but create more hostility, more
upset more apprehension among the workers,'' said Biller. ``We will
fight it on the beaches, on the hill, in negotiations, wherever.''
   Jacobson stressed in his announcement that no current postal
worker need fear for his or her job, although he said it is likely
some will be changed to new duties or transferred to nearby
facilities.
   The focus of the decision is new automated equipment that
permits letters that cannot be read by machine to be viewed on
television screens, where workers can type in the appropriate ZIP
code, allowing the letter to be handled by machinery from then on.
   Test equipment will be installed by Bell and Howell in Nassau
County, N.Y., and by TRW in Louisville, Ky. this fall, with 295
systems planned across the country within three years.
   With the remote video encoding system, the workers typing in the
codes do not have to be in the post office.
   Thus, Jacobson said, contractors will be asked to bid on
supplying workers and facilities and the post office will provide
the equipment. The contracts will be based on bids on sorting
volumes of mail.
   Jacobson said the Postal Service projects that in 1992 the
average postal worker will cost $29.85 per hour, including salary
and benefits. The cost for a workers in a private firm is expected
to be $14.52, he said, with the cost of the building lease and
telecommunications raising it to about $18 per hour.
   The plan is for the sorting contractor to hire people to work
five or six hours daily, mostly in the evening after mail has been
collected and needs to be sorted before delivery, the assistant
postmaster general explained.
   That schedule would also cause problems if postal workers were
used, he said, since they normally work eight-hour shifts.
   While the sorting jobs with a contractor are not necessarily
full-time jobs, Jacobson said the expected mail volume will require
the equivalent of about 12,000 fulltime people.
   The Postal Service now employs about 800,000 workers and annual
attrition is about 20,000, he said.

<HEAD>Unemployment Persists in Some Rural Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment in rural America has eased since
the harsh times of the early 1980s, but an Agriculture Department
analyst says there are still pockets where jobs are scarce.
   Moreover, said Leslie A. Whitener of the department's Economic
Research Service, the general improvement in the rural job picture
apparently has stalled, at least temporarily.
   After declining for four years, the rural unemployment rate
remained unchanged from a year earlier in the first quarter of
1990, averaging 6.6 percent.
   ``This may mean that non-metro (rural) employment rates are
leveling off as rural areas complete their recovery,'' Whitener
said. ``Or it may reflect the recent slowdown in the national
economy.''
   Whitener said current indicators ``do not point to a substantial
weakening of the rural labor market,'' although there will probably
be a ``more moderate job growth and stable unemployment rates'' for
the remainder of 1990.
   On an annual basis, rural unemployment rose to a peak of 10.1
percent nationally in 1982 and 1983. It dropped to 6.2 percent in
1988 and 5.7 percent in 1989.
   Whitener said that compares with a metro unemployment rate of
5.2 percent last year. Before the slump of the early 1980s, rural
rates were lower than urban rates, he said in the July issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``Non-metro employment conditions are increasingly important for
farmers, as greater numbers of farm families turn to off-farm
earnings to supplement farm income,'' he said.
   According to the 1987 census of agriculture, more than half of
all farm operators held off-farm jobs that year.
   ``While rural joblessness has declined overall, many pockets of
high unemployment persist,'' Whitener said. ``Unemployment in
non-metro counties in 1989 ranged from 1.2 percent in Faulk County,
S.D., to 34.5 percent in Starr County, Texas.''
   Also, he said, some population groups, particularly minorities
and teen-agers, continue to dominate the unemployment picture.
   In 1989, 15.3 percent of the rural teen-agers, 12 percent of the
blacks and 9.3 percent of Hispanics were without jobs. Rural black
teen-agers were reported at an unemployment rate of more than 32
percent.
   About 2,400 of the nation's 3,000-plus counties are classified
as rural. Of these, 900 or 38 percent showed the brightest
employment picture in 1989.
   ``These counties were spread throughout the Midwest, New
England, the mountain states of Nevada, Idaho and Montana, and the
Eastern Seaboard states of Virginia and North Carolina,'' Whitener
said.
   A large proportion of these low-unemployment counties depend
greatly on farming, and farm-dependent counties traditionally have
had lower jobless rates, he said. Even so, many of these
agricultural counties have had sizable population declines and
little or no employment growth in recent years.
   On the other hand, more than 600 counties, or 25 percent of all
rural counties, had unemployment rates of more than 8 percent, one
and one-half times the national average last year.
   ``Some of these high-unemployment counties, particularly in
Texas, Alaska, parts of the Southeast and the Mississippi Delta are
dependent on natural gas and oil production,'' Whitener said.
   Most of these counties have seen some decline in unemployment
since 1986, but their rates are still high.
   High unemployment rates in other rural counties have been more
persistent over time, he said. Mining areas of Michigan, Oregon and
parts of Appalachia were hit hard during the early 1980s and have
not yet fully recovered.
   The manufacturing, timber and resort areas of the northern
Pacific and Great Lakes states also have experienced persistently
high unemployment rates, largely because they depend on seasonal
employment, Whitener said.
   ``Chronically high unemployment rates also typify the Indian
reservations of the Northern Plains and the Southwest, as well as
areas of the Mississippi Delta and Southeastern states with
predominantly poor Hispanic or black populations,'' he said.
``Limited employment opportunities and work forces with low levels
of education and training characterize many of these counties.''

   Tokyo, where sirloin steak is more than $20 a
pound in grocery stores, continues with the highest retail food
costs, according to an Agriculture Department survey.
   The informal survey involved a marketbasket of items checked in
May by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service in 18 world
capitals. The survey has been conducted periodically for many years
to show how U.S. food prices stack up against those in other
countries.
   Cost of the Japanese grocery list of 15 items was $117.33
against 13th-ranked Washington, D.C., at $52.69.
   Boneless sirloin steak was $20.75 per pound in Tokyo, compared
with $4.43 in Washington. The least expensive was $1.07 per pound
in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
   Shoppers found boiler chicken at $3.82 per pound in Stockholm,
Sweden, compared with $1.03 in Washington and a low of 70 cents per
pound in Buenos Aires.
   The conversion to U.S. dollars was based on exchange rates at
the time of the survey, the agency said.
   According to the survey, here are the costs of the food
marketbasket in May in the various foreign capitals, in U.S.
dollars.
   l. Tokyo, $117.33.
   2. Stockholm, $107.23.

   A world away, in Moscow, street vendors are lucky
if they can offer puny plums and odd-looking strawberries. Consider
the contrast with Houston, where summit diners today are feasting
on mounds of luscious raspberries and rows of fresh shrimp.
   Food has been on everyone's mind at the 16th annual economic
summit.
   For the leaders of the free world, it is a question of how to
help President Mikhail Gorbachev put enough food on Soviet tables
to calm growing political unrest.
   That desire is shared by all the summit partners, but they are
divided over how to achieve it. West Germany and France favor hard
cash. The United States, Japan and Britain are opposed.
   But Bush, mindful of Gorbachev's fragile hold on power, may well
offer the Soviets help in distributing food more evenly throughout
the country to alleviate the shortages which make food rationing a
way of life for 287 million Soviets.
   In Moscow, for example, shoppers were told at the end of May
that each would be limited to 4.4 pounds of meat; 2.2 pounds of
sausages; 1.1 pounds of cottage cheese; 10 eggs and 4.4 pounds of
bread. The decree did not specify the duration of the rationing,
although such quantities are usually for one month.
   On Sunday night at the Astrodome complex in Houston, hosts laid
on 3{ tons of barbecue meat and 1,250 gallons of barbecue sauce
Sunday night at a rodeo and country music display for the leaders
and several thousand guests.
   On Saturday night, there were 4,000 fresh oysters, 1,000 Texas
bobwhite quail, 1,500 alligator tails and 60 gallons of red beans
and rice spread around four museums for an extravagant gala in
which guests shuttled from site to site, entertained by bands,
talking parrots and art masterpieces.
   The event, intended for the 3,000 reporters accredited to the
summit, also drew Houston's moneyed elite, who raised $10 million
to host the summit.
   And then there's the 20,000 tons of meat and fish among some
$250,000 worth of food at the Brown Convention Center, where meals
will be served continuously throughout the three-day summit to
reporters and officials _ for free.
   A pianist from the Houston symphony plays soothing notes to help
the diners digest in the 100,000-square-foot hall. Outside, 11
refrigerated semitrailers store the food in the heavy heat.
   ``A drop of that food could save many, many lives,'' said
Ytbarek Cuddus, a representative of the Eritrean Liberation Front,
who is organizing a protest outside the summit site at Rice
University on Tuesday.
   Relief organizations estimate some 1.5 million Eritreans are in
danger of starving _ the result of prolonged drought and nearly 30
years of fighting to secede from Ethiopia. Demonstrators will
underline their concerns that in the rush to help the new
democracies of Eastern Europe, Western leaders are ignoring the
poorest countries of Africa.
   Some Houstonians, too, are upset by the summit's bounty. Jon
Matthews, host of a popular morning call-in show on KPRC Radio,
said callers were irate at the free food for the media, saying
``reporters have expense accounts. They can feed themselves.''
   Some suggested the money raised for the summit should have gone
to feed the city's needy.
   The summit caterers heeded the call, in part.
   The Houston Food Bank, which distributes food to 400 charities
in a 25-county area, said it had been promised summit leftovers.

   A Senate subcommittee chairman is asking
whether a former aide to George Bush used political influence on
behalf of a businessman who acquired 15 insolvent savings and loans
with a $1,000 investment.
   James M. Fail, a Phoenix insurance executive, borrowed $70
million while putting up the $1,000 of his own in December 1988 to
acquire the thrift institutions, which now operate as the
Dallas-based Bluebonnet Savings Bank.
   Fail was represented in the deal by Robert J. Thompson, once
congressional liaison for President Bush when he was vice president.
   In a Dec. 5, 1988, letter released Monday by the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business
rights, Thompson pressed M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to make a decision on the deal.
   ``Time is of the essence and, therefore, we feel compelled to
ask for a decision immediately,'' Thompson wrote, addressing the
letter to ``Danny'' and signing it ``Bob.''
   Seventeen days later, the bank board, which has since been
disbanded, voted to award the thrifts to Fail, with an estimated
government subsidy of $1.8 billion in 1988 dollars.
   Subsequently, Fail, through Bluebonnet and his insurance
companies, lent Thompson more than $500,000 _ $356,250 in a
mortgage for a home in Washington and a $150,000 business loan,
according to documents released by the subcommittee.
   Lance Morgan, a spokesman for Thompson, said payments on both
loans were current.
   ``To what extent did Robert Thompson's political connections and
personal friendships influence the outcome of the bidding
process?'' asked the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio.
   Wall, in a telephone interview, said Thompson's connections
played no role in the decision. He said he knew Thompson as a
lobbyist, not as a friend, and had not known him when he worked for
Bush. In fact, he said he knew a competing bidder, Weston Edwards,
better.
   Metzenbaum, the only subcommittee member present during a
four-hour session Monday, said he would push the panel to subpoena
Fail, Thompson, Wall and others, within the week. All declined
invitations to appear voluntarily.
   ``They have failed to show up until this point. We intend to get
them here. They owe the public an explanation,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Fail's attorney, Stanley M. Brand, in a statement released after
the hearing, challenged the subcommittee's jurisdiction to look
into S&amp;L matters.
   He said it was misleading to say Fail had bought Bluebonnet for
only $1,000 because he had pledged his holdings as collateral for
the $70 million in loans.
   ``It is not difficult to conclude that today's hearing was
motivated by sheer political opportunism,'' Brand said, labeling
Metzenbaum a ``political vigilante.''
   Wall complained that Metzenbaum was presenting information
``very selectively'' and said he had declined to testify only
because he wasn't given enough time to prepare. He said he was
willing to present his case before the panel.
   In the waning months of the Reagan administration, the bank
board under Wall concluded scores of bailout deals _ more than 200
in 1988, over 70 in December alone.
   Wall said the deals are saving taxpayers money _ outside
analysts estimate $1 billion a month, compared with the cost of
liquidating the institutions. Liquidation was not a practical
option in any case because regulators did not have the cash to do
that until Congress enacted the S&amp;L bailout in August 1989, he said.
   Metzenbaum said he would continue to investigate the other
transactions.
   ``I don't believe this is the only deal that was made that has
questions surrounding it,' he said.

<HEAD>Southern Command Chief Admitted to Walter Reed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the field commander in
charge of the U.S. invasion of Panama, is being treated for
suspected leukemia at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, according to
the Pentagon.
   Thurman, 59, will undergo additional tests ``to determine what
treatment may be appropriate,'' the Pentagon said Monday in a brief
statement.
   The four-star general is head of the U.S. Southern Command,
based in Panama, and is in charge of all U.S. forces in Central and
South America.
   The general took over the command on Sept. 30, 1989, and was
dubbed ``Mad Max'' for his feisty and aggressive style.
   A native of High Point, N.C., and a graduate of North Carolina
State University at Raleigh, Thurman has served more than 36 years
in the Army.
   Besides his current position, he has served as the Army's vice
chief of staff, its deputy chief of staff for personnel and
commander of the training and doctrine unit.
   Thurman has been widely credited with convincing the Pentagon
leadership and Bush administration to use military force in
response to Gen. Manuel Noriega's regime in Panama.
   He played a central role in drafting the plans for the December
invasion along with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Colin Powell.
   The general was scheduled to take mandatory retirement August
1989, but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney insisted he take over the
Southern Command and help with the administration's struggle to
deal with Noriega in the wake of allegations the Panamanian
dictator was involved in drug trafficking.
   At the ceremony in which he took over the Southern Command,
Thurman pledged he would confront ``tyranny in all its insidious
forms.''
   The general made his mark as an aggressive, take-charge
commander ``who didn't hesitate to work around the clock,'' said
one Army source, who spoke on condition of not being identified.
``He had this reputation for driving his staff crazy because he was
a bachelor and the guy never went home.''
   Thurman earned high praise during his tenure at the helm of the
Army's Recruiting Command at Fort Sheridan, Ill., where he worked
to develop the service's well-known ``Be All That You Can Be''
campaign.
   The Pentagon statement said the initial diagnosis was made as
the result of tests conducted on Friday and Monday at the hospital
in suburban Washington.
   ``General Thurman has been admitted to confirm an initial
diagnosis of leukemia,'' the statement said.
   Pentagon sources said the general was expected to remain at the
hospital so that doctors could confirm their diagnosis.
   ``He's wasn't feeling well and had been in and out of the
hospital,'' said the Pentagon source. ``The earlier tests suggested
leukemia, and the more recent ones have helped confirm that.''
   In Thurman's absence, the Southern Command's deputy
commander-in-chief, Adm. David Chandler, will be in command, said
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   Asked whether Thurman will be able to resume his duties in
Panama, Williams replied that Cheney ``will discuss that with Gen.
Thurman when the secretary returns from his NATO visit later this
week.''
   Cheney, who was traveling to several NATO nations such as Norway
and Greece, was scheduled to return to Washington on Wednesday in
order to join budget discussions.

   Leaders of the world's seven richest nations
failed to find a common approach to shore up the sickly Soviet
economy, but moved Monday toward a summit compromise allowing each
country to go its own way on financial assistance to Moscow.
   Trade and environmental disputes, as well as Japan's unpopular
campaign to ease sanctions against China, also tested the harmony
as the 16th annual economic summit began its first post-Cold War
session.
   At a dinner hosted by President Bush at a Houston mansion, the
leaders focused on Soviet aid and China. Their foreign ministers,
dining at a restaurant, grappled with the same issues. A U.S.
official said the problems ``have not been put to bed,'' but said
that some recent liberalization in Beijing will be welcomed.
   A Japanese foreign ministry official said Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu told the other leaders he will resume $5.2 billion in loans
to China that were interrupted last year.
   French presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine said ``there are
still differences of opinion'' on how to deal with the Soviet aid
question in a political communique to be issued Tuesday.
   A tentative draft, awaiting final approval by the leaders, made
no direct reference to the Soviets' plight but prescribed
``economic assistance as appropriate'' to countries moving toward
democracy. That leaves the door open for summit countries to act
individually.
   ``Very good discussions,'' said President Bush as the initial
talks concluded. On the overriding issue, no one was pretending the
leaders had found commond ground _ but Monday's meeting seemed to
eliminate any formal objections to any of the allies sending cash
to Moscow.
   West Germany, France and Italy are ready to send direct aid to
the Soviets, while the United States, Britain and Japan are
pressing for additional economic reform. Canada is in the middle,
extending commercial credits but not cold cash.
   ``It's premature to say they have settled on any one course of
action,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after the
leaders' first meeting. ``Our feeling is individual countries
certainly are free to follow their own dictates on these matters.''
   ``We must not put ourselves in the position ... of propping up
regimes that have only half-changed so we make it easier for them
to avoid the full rigors of change,'' said Britain's Margaret
Thatcher, emphasizing her opposition to Soviet aid.
   On the other side, France's Francois Mitterrand said, ``If we
don't decide now to help the Soviet Union there is a risk that
there will be no progress, no further reform'' of the Soviet
political system. Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
have pushed for a $15-billion aid package.
   Diplomatic sources said six of the nations are inclined to
maintain trade restrictions against China, with only Japan poised
to end the commercial sanctions imposed after last year's
anti-democracy crackdown.
   On economic disputes, Europeans are resisting Bush's staunch
demand for phasing out farm subsidies over the next 10 years and,
together with Canada, are pushing Washington for agreement on new
steps to halt global warming.
   Putting the best face on environmental differences, Fitzwater
said the leaders would pronounce general agreement on issues such
as protection against pollution, preservation of forests and other
global problems.
   Kohl disputed Bush, saying that decisive measures _ rather than
more study _ are urgently needed to reduce the ``greenhouse
effect,'' the gradual warming of the earth attributed to emissions
from autos and manufacturing.
   On trade, Bush argued ``very forcefully'' for phasing out
billions of dollars of agricultural subsidies but met resistance
from European leaders. The White House fears that global free trade
talks will collapse without a resolution of the farm dispute.
   Cannon salutes and military pageantry greeted the leaders of
West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan as they
assembled on the campus of Rice University for three days of talks.
   In his welcoming remarks as summit host, Bush challenged his
partners ``to bring a new stability and prosperity to the world by
tapping the power and energy of free wills and free markets.''
   The summit debate on Soviet aid was closely monitored in Moscow.
   Senior Soviet officials rejected Bush's reasons for resisting
help for the Soviet Union. The president has expressed concerns
over Soviet military spending, its subsidies for Cuba and the lack
of reforms in Moscow's government-controlled economy.
   ``To dictate conditions to such a country as the Soviet Union, a
great power, is embarrassing,'' said Gorbachev staff member Georgy
Shakhnazarov. ``We aren't taking orders.''
   Reporting on the summit discussion of Gorbachev's plea for aid,
French spokesman Hubert edrine said, ``There were shades of
differences but nobody said no.''
   Gorbachev also was seeking a ``sustained economic dialogue''
between Moscow and the summit nations, winning support from
Canada's Brian Mulroney.
   In the absence of unanimity on Soviet aid, the leaders appeared
ready to send a team of Western bankers and other experts to Moscow
to assess needs in transportation, marketing and other areas,
diplomatic sources said.
   Fitzwater predicted the summit would produce a strong statement
of support for reforms in Eastern Europe and for Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' program of economic reforms and would
recognize the need of each country to act on an individual basis in
terms of direct financial assistance.
   Bush told Kohl he understands Bonn's desire to give unilateral
support to the Soviet Union, Fitzwater said. West Germany, eager to
remove obstacles to unification with East Germany, has pledged $3
billion in credits to Moscow.
   Bush is offering the Soviets technical assistance for
transportation and agriculture and advice on developing free-market
mechanisms. Staff chief John Sununu noted that the Soviets
currently lose almost half their grain crop through faulty storage.
   Officials said the leaders would approve an assessment team to
recommend applications for western assistance. Sununu said the
study might be conducted by a mixture of western financing
agencies, including the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
   A British official said the foreign ministers, meeting
separately, agreed there should be a full analysis of Soviet
requirements before a joint decision on aid.
   At an outdoor welcoming ceremony _ airconditioned and shortened
because of the unrelenting Texas heat _ Bush said, ``A new world of
freedom lays before us. Hopeful. Confident. A world where peace
endures, where commerce has a conscience and where all that seems
possible is possible.''
   ``So let us begin, in good faith, to set the stage for the new
millennium,'' the president said.
   After the ceremony, the leaders adjourned to a cavernous meeting
room for talks around a long oval table. The meeting was a prelude
to free-wheeling political discussions over dinner at Bayou Bend, a
stately mansion that once was the home of the late Ima Hogg, the
oil-rich daughter of the first native-born governor of Texas.
   On two other issues unanimity was easy.
   The summit leaders will condemn terrorism and deplore the
proliferation of missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons technology.
   The argument over farm subsidies turned bitter at a May meeting
attended by U.S. and European officials. Frans Andriessen, the
community's top trade official, said in Houston that continued
pressure by the United States would backfire and make it even
harder to reach a compromise.
   Yet, Sununu said, ``It is crucial, it is critical, it should and
must be done. The United States believes in that issue so strongly
that we will continue to make that point to our allies.''

   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
called out the army Monday night to quell protests by thousands of
Sandinistas, who have blocked streets with barricades and fought
her supporters with guns, fists and rocks.
   Gunfire could be heard in many parts of the Nicaraguan capital,
but reporters could get not close because of the shooting.
   Police sources, who insisted on anonymity, said at least three
people were killed and more than 100 injured in the unrest, which
began Sunday night.
   Mrs. Chamorro addressed the nation on state radio and television
as thousands of Sandinistas backing a week-long wave of strikes
returned to the streets and, defying government orders, erected
more barricades.
   There was some question, however, of whether the
Sandinista-dominated army would support Mrs. Chamorro.
   In the speech, the president urged ``democratic Nicaraguans not
to let themselves be provoked, and not to answer violence with
violence, which has already claimed victims.''
   The speech was delayed for four hours as police cleared
pro-Sandinista students and workers who had seized a government
broadcasting center.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who took office in April after handing the
Sandinistas a stunning electoral defeat, said her government was
committed to national reconciliation that ``ought to occur in a
climate of peace and understanding, not of fear and intimidation.''
   Nicaragua's economy has been battered by nearly 10 years of war
between the Sandinistas and the now disbanded, U.S.-backed Contra
rebels and by an economic embargo by the Reagan administration.
   Mrs. Chamorro accused the leftist Sandinistas of directing the
nationwide strike and inciting unrest. Despite their defeat in
February elections at the hands of her U.S.-backed coalition, the
Sandinistas remain the country's largest political force.
   The strikes, which have plunged Nicaragua into chaos, were
called in part to protest what unions say are massive firings by
the Chamorro government. Workers also want a greater voice in
setting economic policy.
   Daniel Ortega, who Mrs. Chamorro unseated as president, urged
her government to negotiate.
   ``This conflict cannot be solved by force. Any attempt in that
direction is an invitation to chaos,'' he said in a radio interview.
   The road to the international airport was blocked Monday night
by barricades made of paving stones. Police using backhoes had
cleared debris earlier, but the strikers blocked the road again.
   The demonstrators burned rubber tires and trash alongside the
barricades Monday night, sending smoke billowing over the city.
   It was reminiscent of the 1979 revolution, when Sandinistas
built roadblocks in their fight to overthrow dictator Gen.
Anastasio Somoza.
   Electricity and water service to most of this city of about 1
million were cut off. An air traffic controllers' strike closed the
airport.
   Mail service and operator-assisted phone calls have been
suspended since last week. Strike leaders claim more than 80,000
public and private sector workers have joined the walkout, which
began last week with sporadic strikes.
   The strikes are directed against government offices, public
transportation, telephone and mail services, banks, and state-run
agriculture, textile and construction businesses.
   Despite the reports on casualties from police sources, Dr.
Gustavo Fletes, chief of the emergency ward at Lenin Fonseca
Hospital, said in a telephone interview he had knowledge of only
one person killed and 20 injured.
   Manolo Morales Hospital, another center for emergency cases,
said it had no dead but only 10 injured, some of them seriously.
Other private and public hospitals checked said they had no victims
from street fighting.
   Carlos Torres, an announcer at Radio Corporacion, said four
guards were wounded when a group of men armed with AK-47 automatic
rifles tried to shoot their way into the privately owned
broadcasting station.
   Torres said Radio Corporacion employees had received anonymous
telephone threats saying the station would be burned down.
   He said Radio Corporacion went off the air shortly after the
attack Monday night ``for reasons that I do not know.''
   Mrs. Chamorro took office amid high hopes she could resolve the
nation's economic crisis and its bitter political divisions.
   At least 30,000 people died in that conflict.
   The government suspended talks with the strikers over the
weekend, saying negotiations must deal only with labor issues, not
political topics.
   It declared the strike illegal, claiming it was politically
motivated. The declaration allows the government to fire striking
workers.
   Thousands of Nicaraguans with machetes and clubs swarmed into
Managua's streets Sunday night and Monday morning to light bonfires
and build barricades. The barricades kept many workers from
reporting to their jobs.
   In the low-income eastern neighborhoods, protesters passed
paving stones from hand to hand to build roadblocks and burned huge
bonfires of old tires.
   It was in those neighborhoods that some of the most intense
fighting took place during the 1979 revolution and where Sandinista
support is still strong.

   The Rev. Billy Graham plans to preach at a
crusade this weekend in his first public appearance since
undergoing rib surgery in April.
   Doctors wanted the 71-year-old evangelist to rest longer, but
Graham told his staff that ``God wants me to come to Albany,'' said
spokesman A. Larry Ross.
   Graham is scheduled to speak at the Knickerbocker Arena on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the closing nights of the eight-day
Christian crusade.
   The Rev. Ralph Bell, who has worked with Graham for 25 years,
filled in for him when the crusade opened Sunday.

   Sam Kinison's bodyguard has been ordered to
stand trial on charges of raping the comedian's girlfriend.
   Municipal Judge David Horwitz on Monday ordered Unway Carter,
22, to be arraigned Friday on rape and sexual assault charges.
Carter was arrested outside Kinison's Hollywood Hills home June 21.
   Authorities said Kinison met the 6-foot-4, 300-pound Carter the
night before the attack and hired him as a bodyguard.
   Kinison's girlfriend testified at a preliminary hearing Monday
that Carter raped her in Kinison's home while the comedian was
asleep in another part of the house.
   She said she grabbed a gun after the attack and chased Carter,
firing several shots at him but missing. The woman, in her mid-20s,
said she then fled to a neighbor's house and called police.
   Kinison, 36, is known for his screaming, obscenity-filled act
that has brought protests from women and gay groups.
   He commented in passing about the case Monday during a news
conference for a concert tour by singer Billy Idol.
   ``My suggestion to every man in America, and to every woman in
America, is to keep a gun in your house,'' Kinison said. ``And
especially, women, don't be afraid to use it. It will keep you
alive, no matter what the law says.''

   Foul-mouthed comedian Andrew Dice Clay is under
attack from more of his peers.
   Clay generates ``brown shirt humor'' for an audience of
teen-agers who have grown up believing that contempt for civil
rights, women and gay people is condoned by the government, says
fellow comedian Richard Belzer.
   Belzer characterized Clay as ``just a demigod who panders to the
worst instincts of humanity'' during a taped interview with
talk-show host Geraldo Rivera. The interview is to be broadcast
Wednesday.
   Clay's routine is filled with sexually explicit language and
disparages homosexuals and women. His performance on ``Saturday
Night Live'' prompted boycotts of the program by cast member Nora
Dunn and singer Sinead O'Connor.
   On Monday, Starr Parodi, the keyboard player in talk show host
Arsenio Hall's band, announced she would refuse to perform on
tonight's show featuring the stand-up comic.
   ``As an employee of `The Arsenio Hall Show,' I cannot show my
disapproval of Clay by turning the channel, but I can refuse to
play in the band,'' she said.
   On hearing about the boycott, Clay said: ``It's a goof. She'll
be there. Believe me, she'll be there. That girl is crazy is about
me.''

<HEAD>Greenpeace Marks Fifth Anniversary of Ship Sinking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The environmental group
Greenpeace marked the fifth anniversary of France's sabotage
sinking of its protest ship, Rainbow Warrior, by presenting Gruyere
cheese to the French Embassy today.
   To the beat of a drum, the 18 protesters also delivered to the
embassy a wreath, a mock grave and a headstone marked ``F. Pereira,
murdered July 1985.''
   French secret agents blasted two holes in the hull of the
Rainbow Warrior, a 30-year-old former North Sea cod trawler, as it
was moored in Auckland Harbor just before midnight on July 10,
1985. Dutch photographer Fernando Pereira, 33, drowned as he tried
to save his camera gear.
   Greenpeace nuclear test-ban spokeswoman Stephanie Mills said the
Gruyere cheese was symbolic of Mururoa Atoll, the site of French
nuclear testing in the Pacific. She said the atoll is full of holes
and acts as a leaky radioactive waste dump.
   France has conducted 60 atmospheric nuclear tests over Mururoa
and more than 120 underground tests since 1975. Four have been held
in the last month; another two are expected soon.
   Six days after the Rainbow Warrior sinking, police arrested two
of the bombers _ Maj. Alain Mafart and Capt. Dominique Prieur of
the French secret service, which wanted to stop Greenpeace's
anti-nuclear protests.
   Two months later, then-French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius
confirmed that secret service agents were responsible. Defense
Minister Charles Hernu resigned, and the secret service chief, Adm.
Pierre Lacoste, was sacked.
   Mafart and Prieur pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges and
were sentenced to 10 years in jail. Chief Justice Sir Ronald
Davison called the destruction of the Rainbow Warrior ``a
deliberate planned action of a terrorist nature.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar agreed in June
1986 to mediate the international dispute over the incident.
   He ruled that France should apologize and pay New Zealand $7
million as compensation. He also said Mafart and Preiur should be
transferred to Hao Atoll, a French military facility on an isolated
island outside Europe, for three years. On July 23, 1986, they were
handed over to the French, who moved them to Hao.
   In December 1987, Mafart returned to Paris without New Zealand's
consent. The French claimed he needed medical attention for stomach
pains. Then-New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange called the move
an ``outrage.''
   In early May 1988, just before the French presidential election,
Prieur was whisked back to France, again without New Zealand's
consent, amid reports she was pregnant.
   New Zealand filed a formal complaint to France over the agents'
repatriation and asked, unsuccessfully, that they be returned to
Hao.
   Two months ago, a three-person international tribunal ruled that
France had breached terms of the 1986 settlement. France agreed to
a suggestion that it set up a $2 million French-New Zealand
friendship fund.

   In a battle of box-office heavyweights, the
action sequel ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' starring Bruce Willis
raced ahead of ``Days of Thunder'' to take the No. 1 position away
from the Tom Cruise star vehicle.
   The performance of ``Die Hard 2,'' which reportedly cost more
than $62 million to make, is impressive because the film was
competing against other highly promoted films such as ``Dick
Tracy,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Another 48 HRS.'' and ``RoboCop 2.''
   ``We're going to tell people that the summer just started,''
said Tom Sherak, president of domestic distribution and marketing
for ``Die Harder'' maker 20th Century Fox.
   The sequel to ``Die Hard'' opened to robust business, grossing
$21.7 million in its debut weekend despite fierce competition.
   Figures released Monday by Entertainment Data Inc. showed ``Die
Hard 2'' collected $6 million more than ``Days of Thunder'' did in
its premiere engagement two weekends ago.
   In second place, down a modest 31 percent, was ``Days of
Thunder'' with returns of $10.7 million. It was followed by ``Dick
Tracy,'' which collected $6.6 million for a 34 percent slowdown.
   ``Jetsons: The Movie,'' an animated family film based on the
television cartoon, opened in fourth place with ticket sales of $5
million. Fifth was Arnold Scwarzenegger's ``Total Recall,'' with
receipts of $4.2 million.
   ``Another 48 HRS.'' placed sixth with a gate of $4.1 million,
and ``RoboCop 2'' followed in seventh with returns of $3.6 million,
down sharply from the previous weekend of $6.4 million.
   In eighth was ``Ghost Dad,'' grossing $3.2 million, and
``Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' was ninth with $2.6 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 was ``Pretty Woman,'' making $2.5
million. ``Pretty Woman'' has now made more than $153.6 million and
is the year's biggest hit so far.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Entertainment Data, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder,'' Fox, $21.7 million, 2,509
screens, $8,666 per screen, $35.6 million, one week.
   2. ``Days of Thunder,'' Paramount, $10.7 million, 2,307 screens,
$4,641 per screen, $40.5 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Dick Tracy,'' Disney, $6.6 million, 2,209 screens, $3,005
per screen, $81.7 million, four weeks.
   4. ``Jetsons: The Movie,'' Universal, $5 million, 1,562 screens,
$3,220 per screen, $5 million, one week.
   5. ``Total Recall,'' Tri-Star, $4.2 million, 1,787 screens,
$2,359 per screen, $99.2 million, six weeks.
   6. ``Another 48 HRS.,'' Paramount, $4.1 million, 1,850 screens,
$2,194 per screen, $66.1 million, five weeks.
   7. ``RoboCop 2,'' Orion, $3.6 million, 1,806 screens, $2,015 per
screen, $32.6 million, three weeks.
   8. ``Ghost Dad,'' Universal, $3.2 million, 1,221 screens, $2,610
per screen, $10.9 million, two weeks.
   9. ``Gremlins 2,'' Warner Bros., $2.6 million, 1,810 screens,
$1,459 per screen, $34.5 million, four weeks.
   10. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $2.5 million, 1,157 screens,
$2,177 per screen, $153.6 million, 16 weeks.

<HEAD>Parents Group in Middle of Debate Over Warning Labels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A parents group is battling charges of
censorship as its campaign for voluntary warning stickers on
records promoting bigotry, rape and murder wins allies in
legislatures and within the music industry.
   The Parents Music Resource Center founded by Elizabeth
``Tipper'' Gore says it is promoting truth-in-packaging to help
parents and their children deal with an entertainment culture that
is increasingly violent and sexually explicit.
   ``Part of our problem is our culture tends to look at children
as miniature adults,'' said Jennifer Norwood, executive director of
the parents group. ``We expect them to handle things they're not
ready to handle yet at their age. Groups like 2 Live Crew are
dealing with adult issues.''
   But some opponents say the labels are censorship because artists
and record companies are pressured to use them.
   The labels are ``an invitation to be prosecuted and persecuted.
It's a guilty plea,'' said Dave Marsh, editor and publisher of Rock
&amp; Roll Confidential, a monthly magazine.
   The Arlington-based parents group has made big strides since its
founding in 1985 by Gore, the wife of Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   Four years ago, the Recording Industry Association of America,
under pressure from the group, added warning stickers to certain
albums. The association's members produce about 90 percent of the
recordings made and sold in the United States.
   That effort led to a wide variety of warnings, some smaller than
a postage stamp, before the industry settled earlier this year on a
standardized sticker that reads, ``Explicit Lyrics _ Parental
Advisory.'' The records with the black and white labels are due out
this month.
   Ms. Norwood said parents in her group realize from their own
experience as teen-agers that there always will be a musical
generation gap.
   ``The purpose of rock 'n' roll has always been, to a degree, to
shock parents,'' she said.
   But the ground rules have changed, she said. Some of today's
music promotes bigotry, rape and murder, she and others charge.
   ``Five years ago I had transcribed lyrics and a lot of them were
pretty raunchy and pretty extreme,'' said Maryland legislator
Judith Toth. ``But what I'm seeing now is really something else. A
lot of it is racist. A lot of it is very clearly against women.
It's not just obscene. It's downright filthy.''
   For example, a song by Rigor Mortis graphically describes
cutting off a woman's legs, arms and head after sex. A song by
N.W.A. uses a derogatory word for blacks and describes gunning them
down.
   Opponents of labels say they inhibit artistic creativity.
   The American Civil Liberties Union opposes any industrywide
labeling, including the ratings on movies, said Barry Lynn, ACLU
legislative counsel in Washington.
   ``Even if they were really voluntary, if there had been no
pressure to do this from anyone, there are still likely to be
record stores that will not carry stickered material because of
fear of protest from other pressure groups,'' Lynn said.
   A federal judge in Florida has declared 2 Live Crew's album ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be'' obscene. Three members of the rap group
were arrested June 10 in Hollywood, Fla., on charges of giving an
obscene performance.
   Record stores in several states, including Virginia, have pulled
the record and others like it from the shelves or made them
off-limits to children.
   The Louisiana Legislature passed a bill Saturday that would ban
the sale of labeled records to minors.
   Greg Werkman, general manager of the San Francisco-based
independent label Alternative Tentacles, said his label has lost
sales because it does not use warning stickers. He said its sales
dropped about 20 percent since the stickers came out because stores
are not selling the records or are putting them in areas off-limits
to people under 18.
   ``PMRC will tell you it's voluntary,'' Werkman said. ``What
they're doing is putting pressure on us, trying to turn us into bad
guys.''
   There is a degree of pressure, advocates for warning labels
concede.
   ``But the pressure is being brought to bear by the hundreds of
thousands of people who say they want this,'' Ms. Norwood said.
   Several polls have shown that about 75 percent of adults want
some kind of information on records and tapes describing the
contents, she said.
   Ava Marshall, shopping at a Richmond record store, said she
thought the labels were a good idea.
   ``It may help with children not purchasing things with explicit
sex in it,'' said Ms. Marshall, 35.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer is not saying whether
he will sign a bill banning most abortions, even though it was
apparently drafted to his orders.
   Louisiana lawmakers tacked rape and incest exceptions onto the
bill they passed late Sunday in an attempt to appease Roemer, who
had vetoed an earlier version of the bill which did not include
such exemptions.
   But Roemer left open the possibility of another veto. He said he
was unhappy the way the bill was amended onto a gutted anti-flag
burning measure only 26 hours before the legislative session's
expiration at midnight Monday.
   ``It's unfortunate that legislation this important would be done
at the last minute,'' Roemer said Monday.
   ``And I just want to remind everybody that an option was given
by me long ago to work this thing out to the satisfaction of the
vast majority in this state and its unfortunate that some, for a
variety of reasons, waited until the last minute to give us a
bill.''
   In particular, Roemer said he objected to a requirement that
rape be reported to authorities within seven days.
   ``The seven-day provision on rape is a problem,'' he said,
although he called the measure ``a step in the right direction.''
   Roemer, who is up for re-election next year, refused to say when
he would act on the bill. He did not receive a copy of the bill
until Monday afternoon.
   The new measure was drafted only when it became clear late
Sunday that supporters of the previous bill could not muster a
two-thirds vote in the Senate for a veto override.
   Like the vetoed measure, the new one would send doctors who
perform abortions to jail for up to 10 years with maximum fines of
$100,000.
   Roemer said he was troubled by the way the bill was amended to
Rep. James David Cain's legislation that would have eliminated jail
terms and lowered the fines under simple battery laws for people
convicted of beating a flag burner.
   Louisiana's constitution requires that amendments to a bill be
germane to the original subject matter. The language the Senate
added to Cain's bill after scuttling the flag-burner provisions may
fail that test, Roemer said.
   Roemer has 20 days to veto the bill. If he issues another veto,
lawmakers would have to use a mail ballot to call themselves back
into a ``veto session'' to attempt an override. No Louisiana
legislature has overridden a governor's veto this century.
   If Roemer does not veto the bill or if a veto is overridden, the
bill would become law Sept. 7.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is issuing
new hazardous waste cleanup regulations that it says could cost
industry as much as $42 billion to comply with.
   EPA administrator William K. Reilly on Monday called the plan
``a pragmatic approach for correcting existing problems'' and said
it will ensure ``to the extent practical'' prevention of releases
that might threaten human health and the environment.
   The proposed standards and procedures, drafted to carry out
requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, will be
published later this month in the Federal Register.
   EPA said the new regulations would affect 3,000 to 4,000
facilities, including several hundred owned by the federal
government.
   The agency estimated it could cost privately owned facilities
between $7 billion and $42 billion to meet the requirements. The
price tag for federal facilities would total $3 billion to $18
billion, EPA said in a statement.
   The wide range of the cost estimates is due to markedly varied
conditions from site to site involving uncertain levels of ground
water monitoring and cleanup, the agency said.
   Industries affected would include petroleum refiners, wood
preservers, metal finishers and auto manufacturers.

<HEAD>Some Census Workers Lose Unemployment Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many temporary Census workers may be
ineligible for unemployment compensation when their jobs end
because of a change in the law.
   The actual number of people affected is hard to estimate because
rules for unemployment compensation eligibility vary from state to
state. Neither congressional or census spokesmen would estimate the
number affected.
   In the past, temporary census jobs have counted toward
eligibility for unemployment compensation just as any other job.
   However, this year an appropriations bill signed by President
Bush on May 25 set an April 20 cutoff on census workers getting
credit toward unemployment. Temporary census work done after that
date doesn't count when they are eventually laid off and apply for
unemployment benefits.
   How that cutoff affects individual workers depends on the
unemployment eligibility rules in their states. Some states, for
example, require 26 weeks of work before someone becomes eligible.
People who haven't accumulated that before April 20 would not be
able to collect benefits.

   Ivan Polozkov of Russia and Efrem Sokolov of Byelorussia are

   The Communist Parties of Lithuania and Latvia have split, and
their most progressive members chose to form separate independent
parties.
   The conservative branches loyal to Moscow have representatives

   The Estonian Communist Party plans to split next fall. The
independent faction is led by chairman Vaino Vyalyas and first
secretary Enn Arno Sillari, while the loyalist faction is led by
Alexander Gusev, according to the Estonian News Agency. Both
Estonian factions are represented at the congress.
   The other republic party chiefs are Vladimir Movsisyan of

<HEAD>President's Son Says Investigation Makes Him a `Political
Football'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil says he is fed up
with sitting on the sideline while being publicly attacked for his
savings and loan dealings and is coming out of his ``cage'' to
defend himself.
   In an eight-page statement issued over the weekend and in a
series of interviews, Bush contends he has done nothing wrong in
connection with the failure of Silverado Savings &amp; Loan and
maintains he has become a ``political football'' _ a victim of
political ``opportunism'' and ``press sensationalism.''
   In an interview published in today's editions of The Washington
Post, Bush said it would have ``been much easier'' to sign a civil
decree sought by S&amp;L regulators and ``move on in terms of just the
quality of my life.''
   In the consent decree, sought several months ago, Bush would
have agreed to abstain from further banking activities _ without
acknowledging any wrongdoing.
   The 35-year-old Bush said his decision to seek full exoneration
rather than sign the decree has resulted in negative publicity that
has ``dominated my life for six months'' and also may help
Democrats gain political advantage against his father the president.
   Still, he said, he decided to fight ``because I know I haven't
done anything wrong.''
   He said he is looking forward to a public hearing on his case in
September before an administrative law judge in Denver that he says
will offer an unbiased, quasi-legal forum for his defense.
   ``I've been kind of like a little caged-in animal in an
unsanitary zoo,'' Bush told the Post in an interview in his Denver
office. ``Now my cage is open and I'm telling people ... what my
side of the story is. And I feel good about it.''
   Bush conceded in the Post interview that he got ``an incredibly
sweet deal'' in the form of a $100,000 loan from a Denver investor
that he wasn't required to repay if the oil business the loan was
intended to benefit did not turn a profit. But he said the loan was
``totally unrelated'' to his work as a director of Silverado, even
though the investor who made the investment loan subsequently was
granted a line of credit from Silverado.
   Bush noted that the investor, Kenneth Good, made similar loans
to other Denver area businessmen under similar circumstances,
including one for $350,000. ``But, of course, that won't be of any
kind of interest because his name doesn't relate to somebody
famous,'' Bush said of the $350,000 loan.
   In an interview published over the weekend in The Denver Post,
Bush said Silverado was ``doomed to die'' before he became a
director because it carried $1 billion in commercial real estate
loans at a time the Colorado market was faltering.
   Regulators say Bush failed to disclose a series of business
deals with developers Good and Bill Walters who defaulted on a
combined $130 million in loans from Silverado.
   Bush said the same thrift regulators from the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Topeka, Kan., who approved the loans that contributed to
Silverado's failure, are now trying to blame him for the thrift's
collapse.
   ``It's self-serving. The regulators are politically motivated,''
he said.
   In his eight-page statement, Bush said he was seeking ``an
unbiased and unpolitically motivated forum.''
   ``I think the administrative law judge will provide that
forum,'' he said in the Post interview. ``The system will work.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell to a six-week low against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange tumbled amid uncertainty over currency and interest rates.
   The dollar closed at 149.60 yen, down 1.10 yen from Monday's
finish of 150.70 yen. It was the lowest closing since 149.45 yen on
May 28.
   The dollar opened today at 150.75 yen, down from 151.15 yen late
Monday in New York, and ranged between 149.58 yen and 150.80 yen.
   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average for 225 selected issues shed
385.85 points, or 1.19 percent, closing at 32,152.43. The index had
gained 93.16 the previous day.
   The dollar's slide came after a fairly stable morning session.
   ``The slump in the afternoon session was triggered by news
reports that the seven industrialized nations meeting in Houston
might call for a stronger yen'' in their final communique, said
Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in Japan.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the Japanese news reports gave the market the
excuse it was waiting for to dump the dollar.
   Dealers also cited talk of higher Japanese interest rates in the
near future. This would tend to make the yen more attractive to
investors.
   On the stock market, traders said share prices drifted lower
steadily throughout the day's thin dealings.
   ``Investors want a better view of the yen's direction and
interest rates,`` said Yoshiro Inoue of Nomura Securities.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 million shares,
down from 401.7 million shares the previous day.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers 727 to 220, while 171
issues remained unchanged.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 86.74 points as of 5 p.m. (4 a.m.
EDT) from Monday's close of 87.05. The yield stood at 7.250
percent, up from the previous day's 7.180 percent.

<HEAD>Poll: Americans and Japanese See Each Other as Greatest Economic
Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans and Japanese point to each other when
asked which country will be the No. 1 economic power in the next
century.
   The finding is among the results of a pair of public opinion
polls conducted in the United States by The New York Times and CBS
News and in Japan by the Tokyo Broadcasting System.
   The surveys, which the Times reported today, show that 50
percent of Americans say Japan will be the economic power of the
21st century, while among Japanese, 42 percent pick the United
States.
   Thirty-two percent of Americans pick their own country, as do 39
percent if the Japanese.
   Big majorities in both countries have friendly attitudes toward
the other.
   The 75 percent of Americans who say their overall feelings
toward Japan are generally friendly represents an increase over the
67 percent registered in January.
   In Japan, 66 percent said their feelings toward the United
States were generally friendly, also an increase over the 57
percent measured a year ago.
   Despite friendly feelings, 64 percent of Americans, up from 45
percent in 1987, say that investment by the Japanese in the United
States poses a threat to U.S. economic independence.
   The poll in the United States was conducted among 1,084
Americans reached by phone from June 5 to June 8. In Japan, 1,468
people were interviewed in person from May 31 to June 7.
   Each survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Strong Earthquake Reported in Southern Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake struck a sparsely
populated region in southern Sudan, earthquake monitors in
neighboring Egypt said today. There were no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
   The quake, which measured about 6.6 on the Richter scale, jolted
a jungle-covered area about 50 miles north of Juba in southern
Sudan on Monday night.
   On May 20, the same area was hit by a quake measuring 7.5 on the
Richter scale, followed by a series of aftershocks.
   Ezz-el-Din Ibrahim, director of the earthquake department at
Egypt's National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics,
said the quake measured 6.6 on the Richter scale.
   The Hong Kong Observatory said today it had recorded the quake
at 6.5 on the Richter scale. The scale is a gauge of the energy
released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded
on a seismograph. An increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   Juba is 750 miles south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
   The May earthquake left 31 people dead and 300,000 without
shelter, according to the relief agency of the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has been fighting the government since 1983.
   The rebels control most of the countryside in the three southern
Sudanese regions. Most of the south's six million inhabitants have
been displaced by fighting and famine.

<TEXT>
   Grim statistics point to a crisis for the
nation's black men and the black community must do a better job
nurturing and educating its boy children, a panel concluded at the
NAACP convention.
   Almost one in four black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are
in jail, on parole or on probation, according to a recent study by
the non-profit Sentencing Project. The same study found that fewer
young black attend college than are in the criminal justice system.
   Black men in inner city neighborhoods are less likely to reach
65 than men in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest nations.
Violence is the leading cause of death for blacks ages 15 to 25.
   ``If we cannot turn these numbers around, they threaten the very
existence of this race,'' said Beverly Cole, director of education
and health for the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   The panel highlighted the first day of activities by the 3,000
delegates to the convention, which ends Thursday. In an opening
ceremony, actress Esther Rolle became the first woman to be
presented with the NAACP's annual Civil Rights Leadership Award.
   Among featured speakers will be Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia,
talk show host Oprah Winfrey and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Most panel members speaking Monday agreed education provided a
key to salvation for black society.
   ``We need, as black parents, to get more involved in the
education of our children,'' said John W. Diggs, an official with
the National Institutes of Health. ``We've been turning over the
education of our children to a white power structure.''
   In the face of declining numbers of young black men in higher
education, blacks must continue to fight a perception that blacks,
particularly black males, are academic underachievers, the panel
concluded.
   ``If being smart is being white, then what does being black
mean?'' asked Jawanza Kunjufu, a Chicago school curriculum expert.
``If speaking right is acting white, what is being black?''
   He urged black men who have been successful in business,
education and other fields to be role models. In addition, more
black men must enter the teaching profession, Kunjufu said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in early European trading
today as the British pound surged ahead.
   Gold prices were also lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said sterling's advance appears to be
driving the market and the dollar's direction hinges entirely on
what the pound does.
   ``The dollar's weakness is being caused by sterling's
strength,'' said Manfred Totzauer, senior trader at Citibank in
Frankfurt. ``As long as sterling's rise continues to hold on, I can
imagine the dollar staying weak.''
   But Totzauer said he doesn't expect the dollar will plunge
quickly. ``I don't see a dollar collapse,'' he said.
   Sterling continues to be lifted by speculation that the pound
will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System within a few months.
   In London, the pound was quoted at $1.8223, up more than 1.5
cents from late Monday's $1.8055.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.10 yen to a six-week closing low of
149.60 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of
149.03 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.6410 West German marks, down from 1.6495
   _ 1.3846 Swiss francs, down from 1.3950
   _ 5.5060 French francs, down from 5.5353

   _ 1,202.50 Italian lire, down from 1,208.50
   _ 1.1561 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1590
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $357.55 a
troy ounce this morning, down from $358.15 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $356.00, down from $357.90 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $1.71 to close at a bid of $358.91.

<TEXT>
   Hikers are being discouraged from
stopping or straying along a 14-mile stretch of the Appalachian
Trail in Tennessee because of booby traps and suspicious brush
fires.
   Forest Service officials blamed the incidents, including the
stringing of fish hooks at eye- and hip-level across paths, on a
dispute with landowners who fear their property will be seized to
create a buffer along the trail.
   No injuries have been reported along the route that stretches
2,142.8 miles from Maine to Georgiae, and no arrests have been made.
   Congress has mandated that the Forest Service acquire about 500
feet on each side of the trail. But a Forest Service spokesman,
Bill Sweet, said the agency does not intend to confiscate anyone's
land in the dispute.
   Signs encourage hikers not to stop or leave the trail between
Roan Mountain, Tenn., and the North Carolina border.
   ``Hikers have been scared by them and since we don't know what
we're dealing with, that's a good thing,'' said Brian King of the
Appalachian Trail Conference, a hikers federation.
   ``We haven't had any problems there since late April'' when a
shelter along the trail was burned down, King said. No decision has
been made on when the signs may be removed, he said.

   The thunderstorms developed south of a stationary front curving
through the lower Great Lakes region, producing hail and high winds
from Ohio to New Jersey.
   Thunderstorms also ranged Monday from central Colorado through
southwestern Kansas to Iowa and northern Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from eastern Texas to
the southern Atlantic Coast states.
   Showers were widely scattered across the northern Plains and
Rocky Mountain region.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with fair
skies over the Pacific Coast region.
   Temperatures were above 90 degrees Monday across much of the
area from the southern Plains through the Mississippi Valley to the
middle Atlantic Coast states.
   Temperatures in the West varied from the 60s along the Pacific
Coast to above 100 in the Southwestern deserts.
   The high for the nation was 106 degrees at Bullhead City and
Lake Havasu, Ariz.

<HEAD>Nuclear-Powered Ship Leaves for Seagoing Tests</HEAD>

   Japan's only nuclear-powered ship left port today
in its first attempt to sail under nuclear power.
   The experimental ship Mutsu, long plagued by technical problems
and anti-nuclear protests, had attempted a maiden voyage in 1974.
But the bid was cut short by a radiation leak in the protective
shield of its nuclear reactor.
   The 8,242-ton ship sailed from the Sekinehama port, 360 miles
northeast of Tokyo in Aomori prefecture, under conventional power.
   It was not to sail under nuclear power until it was 110 miles
out to sea, said Yuwao Ikezawa, spokesman of the Atomic Energy
Research Institute.
   Police in Aomori prefecture said about two dozen anti-nuclear
activists protested today's sailing by burning old tires near the
port. But no major trouble was reported.
   Ocean trials lasting about 20 days will be conducted in an area
where they will not interfere with fishing, Ikezawa said. The
spokesman said the reactor would be raised to 50 percent capacity
in the first week and 70 percent the following week.
   The reactor was tested at about 20 percent capacity last week
while the Mutsu was still in port, he said.
   In the last 3{ months, tests were cut short five times because
of technical problems. There were no radiation leaks during the
shutdowns, the spokesman said.
   The reactor, which has an output capacity of 36,000 kilowatts,
had been mothballed since the 1974 leak.
   When the leak occurred, the research vessel drifted for 50 days
in the Pacific because residents did not want it to return to its
home port. Then more protests complicated the search for a berth
where it could be repaired.
   Institute officials have said that if these tests go smoothly,
the ship will make another test voyage in August, then a year-long
experimental trip.
   It is to be retired after the tests.

<TEXT>
   Mobil Oil Corp. has agreed to pump dry an
underground lake of oil, gasoline and naphtha that leaked from a
creekside terminal during the last half-century and collected under
streets of Brooklyn.
   The 14.5 million gallon pool of petroleum products is larger
than the amount lost in the nation's largest one-time oil spill _
the nearly 11 million gallons that leaked from the tanker Exxon
Valdez off Alaska last year.
   While the Alaska spill fouled beaches and killed wildlife, the
Brooklyn oil remains beneath the surface, floating atop an aquifer
_ an underground pool of water not used for drinking.
   State officials said it will take years and cost tens of
millions of dollars to remove the oil.
   Mobil spokesman Mark Cohen said Monday it was unlikely the oil,
once recovered, could be used. Mobil first will try to gauge the
size of the spill, then decide how many wells are needed to pump it
out and where to put them.
   Cohen said Mobil would pay to have the petroleum products
disposed of properly, but said he did not know how or where that
would be done.
   The state believes Mobil is primarily responsible for the spill,
and it may have sued had Mobil not agreed to the cleanup, said Ben
Marvin, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   ``Under this agreement, Mobil has accepted responsibility,''
Marvin said.
   Cohen said, ``Mobil has stated in the past that we will do
whatever is necessary to remedy whatever we're responsible for.
Right now we think that the problem deserves attention and we're
going to do whatever we can to accelerate the cleanup. That's our
primary concern.''
   The oil and other petroleum products leaked from the Greenpoint
terminal, a complex on Newtown Creek where fuel has been stored
since after the Civil War. The leaks date at least to World War II,
Marvin said.
   While Mobil believes the spilled fuel does not endanger health,
``The community is concerned about the problem,'' Cohen said. ``The
state is concerned. Obviously it's something that shouldn't be
there.''
   Authorities have known of the problem at least since 1950, when
gasoline fumes exploded in a sewer on Henry Street. In 1978 they
size of the spill was estimated at 17 million gallons. Of that,
about 2.5 million gallons have been pumped out in a cleanup program
that began in 1981.
   No fuel is known to be leaking from the Greenpoint terminal now,
although authorities cannot be certain about the condition of
underground pipes, Marvin said. The terminal is still is in use,
and Mobil recently paid a $500,000 civil penalty for failing to
report immediately a 50,000-gallon kerosene spill there in February.

<TEXT>
   Two veteran astronauts, heirs to a
daredevil tradition, were grounded by NASA for risky flying after
one was involved in a fatal crash and another flew too close to an
airliner.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson and Navy Capt. David M.
Walker, both shuttle commanders, were disciplined Monday for
violating Johnson Space Center flight crew guidelines.
   ``This is the first time we have removed crew members from
flights for disciplinary reasons,'' said NASA spokesman Jeff Carr.
   One space expert said the pair may just have had too much of the
right stuff.
   ``It's a special breed of man who wants to climb to the top of
the heap in the most dangerous profession there is,'' said Lloyd
Swenson, a space history expert at the University of Houston.
   Swenson said astronauts realize ``working with high-performance
aircrafts in a test capacity is putting the human body as well as
the human mind at risk. Unfortunately, sometimes those people who
like to do those tests make an error in judgment.''
   Gibson, 43, was pulled from shuttle flight assignments and
barred for a year from making T-38 jet trainer flights for
violating a policy that restricts high-risk recreational activities
for astronauts named to flight crews, Carr said.
   The move followed a weekend air show race near New Braunfels,
Texas, in which Gibson's stunt plane collided with another stunt
plane, sending the other pilot hurtling to his death in a corn
field. Gibson landed his plane safely.
   Walker, 46, was suspended for 60 days for infractions that
included an incident last year in which the T-38 he was flying came
within 100 feet of a Pan Am jetliner in a near-collision outside
Washington, Carr said.
   Gibson had piloted an eight-day Challenger mission in 1984 and
commanded a 1986 Columbia mission and a 1988 Atlantis mission.
   Walker piloted a shuttle flight in 1984 and was commander of
Atlantis during a four-day flight in 1989.
   Walker did not return a call Monday. Gibson has an unlisted
number.
   Harlan J. Smith of the University of Texas at Austin, who has
taught science to astronauts, said they are risk-takers by nature.
   ``The work is so fascinating that they volunteer for a duty
where the know the risk every time the rockets are lit, and they
rather cheerfully take that risk,'' Smith said.
   But Smith said NASA must keep them from daredevil conduct off
duty because ``an awful lot has been invested in these people.''
   Swenson indicated the astronauts would understand their
punishments.
   ``They're jet jockeys, no doubt about that. But they're also
Naval officers who are used to discipline,'' he said. Swenson
chronicled NASA history from 1963 to 1973, providing research for
Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff'' on the Mercury astronauts.
   Carr said the timing of the two groundings was coincidence. The
decision to ground Walker was made a week ago, but the announcement
was delayed while authorities searched for a replacement for him on
next year's Pentagon shuttle flight, Carr said.
   Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory will replace Walker as crew
commander on that flight.
   Gibson, widely regarded as one of the shuttle program's most
skilled fliers, was slated to command a fourth mission late next
year. NASA did not immediately name a replacement.
   Meanwhile, the precise location of the hydrogen leak that
grounded the shuttle fleet still eludes NASA engineers, but
officials are looking for a test on Atlantis later this week to
provide answers.
   A laboratory test in California over the weekend confirmed there
is a problem in the design or assembly of a liquid hydrogen
plumbing system on the shuttle, the space agency said.
   William Lenoir, NASA space flight director, said engineers plan
a full-scale leak test on Atlantis on Friday or Saturday.
   Witnesses said space shuttle astronaut S. David Griggs was
killed performing aerial stunts when his World War II vintage plane
crashed in an Arksansas wheat field on June 17, 1989.

<HEAD>Report: As Many as 800 May Have Died in June Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 800 people may have died in ethnic
clashes last month along the border between the Soviet Central
Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kirghizia, a Soviet newspaper
reported today.
   Previously, Soviet authorities had said 148 people died in
fighting near the Kirghiz town of Osh on the border between the two
republics.
   But police Maj. Gen. A.M. Kotlyarov told the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda that about 800 people could not be accounted
for, the report said.
   Many were thought to have been wounded in the fighting, then
carried by relatives into the surrounding mountains. Those who died
from their wounds were buried without notification to Soviet
authorities, the newspaper said.
   ``The scale of the crimes and their cruelty surpasses those
committed in Fergana, Azerbaijan and Armenia,'' said the major,
referring to ethnic clashes in other republics that have claimed
hundreds of lives.
   Tension remains high on the border, the government newspaper
Izvestia said Monday. A state of emergency was in effect in the
town of Jalal-abad, where a 20-year-old Uzbek was killed over the
weekend.
   The suspected killers were in custody, Izvestia reported, but
crowds of angry Uzbeks took to the streets Monday demanding more
members of their ethnic group be included in law enforcement and
KGB bodies, it said.
   No fighting was reported, but police reinforcements sent to the
area stopped a truck full of people armed with hunting rifles and
knives, headed toward Jalal-abad.
   Both the Uzbek and Kirghiz ethnic groups are Moslem and speak
Turkish dialects. The border has been the scene of repeated clashes
over land and water rights, fueled by other disputes.

<HEAD>Nixon Reverses Decision To Restrict Scholars' Admittance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Nixon has reversed a
decision to restrict access to his library and will allow scholars
of all political stripes to use its archives.
   Before Monday's announcement, officials at the privately
operated Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library had said researchers
would be screened.
   Hugh Hewitt, the library's director, had said for example that
reporter Bob Woodward would be barred ``because he is an
irresponsible journalist.''
   Woodward, along with Carl Bernstein, wrote Pulitzer
Prize-winning stories in The Washington Post that helped uncover
the Watergate scandal and lead to Nixon's resignation in 1974.
   Nixon's personal assistant, John Taylor, said Monday that Nixon
wants scholars wishing to use the library to be admitted ``without
regard to their opinions on any subject,'' as long as they are
``qualified and responsible.''
   An exhibition section at the $21 million library and museum is
scheduled to be dedicated July 19 in a ceremony to be attended by
President Bush and former Presidents Reagan and Ford. The archives
will open in fall 1991.
   Taylor said library officials had been working long hours to
meet the opening deadline and ``had not had the opportunity to give
much thought'' to the access question.
   Taylor also said community and political groups will be allowed
to use the library for events, which Hewitt had said would be
restricted to Republican fund-raisers.
   ``I don't anticipate that a lot of Democratic organizations will
want to host events there, but former President Nixon sees no
reason why they should be excluded from doing so,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor said every document of importance from the Nixon
administration, including many relating to Watergate, will be
displayed.

<HEAD>Radical Group Claims Responsibility for Shrine Arson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical leftist group claimed responsibility for
burning down a Shinto shrine connected with the planned coronation
of Emperor Akihito in November, police said today.
   Monday's predawn fire destroyed the main buildings of the Gokoku
Shrine in Akita, about 280 miles north of Tokyo. Akita is one of
two prefectures, or states, where rice will be growceremony associated
with the emperor's coronation.
   The Revolutionary Army, a branch of the Chukaku-ha, or Middle
Core Faction, made the claim of responsibility in handbills sent
today to Japanese news organizations, said a National Pn for use in a
olice Agency
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A member of the radical group contacted by telephone refused to
confirm or deny the authenticity of the handbills.
   The Chukaku-ha and other radical leftist groups oppose the
monarchy and have said they will violently disrupt the coronation
ceremonies.
   The groups particularly oppose the rice ceremony _ during which
the new emperor is believed to commune with the gods _ because they
claim it is a remnant of prewar nationalism.
   The ceremony _ called the Daijosai, or ``great food offering
ritual'' _ is to be conducted 10 days after Akihito's coronation on
Nov. 12.
   Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is based on nature worship,
shamanism anher
procedures _ never telling him of his cells' value _ while they
developed Moore's cells into a self-perpetuating cell line to
mass-produce GM-CSF.
   The Regents of the University of California patented the cell
line in 1984, naming Golde and a research assistant, Shirley Quan,
as the inventors. The same year, Moore sued Golde, Quan, the UC
Regents and the two companies working on the product, Sandoz and
Genetics Institute Inc.
   The suit estimated the potential value of the product as $3
billion. It said Golde and others had gotten $3 million worth of
Genetics Institute stock.

   Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, the nation's first
black archbishop and its highest ranking black Roman Catholic,
resigned his position today, a spokesman said.
   The Rev. Peter Dora, the Atlanta Archdiocese spokesman, said
Marino cited ``personal reasons'' for his resignation.
   The 55-year-old archbishop, who was installed in May 1988, had
temporarily relinquished his duties in May because of severe stress
and a near heart attack. Marino was recuperating at a New York area
resort.
   Dora said the Most Rev. James P. Lyke was appointed apostolic
administrator, but that officials did not know when a new
archbishop would be appointed.
   The Archdiocese of Atlanta covers 69 counties in northern
Georgia with a Catholic population of more than 150,000.

   Security forces clashed with rioters in
rural areas and in neighborhoods of Nairobi today, a day after the
government ordered the use of lethal force to quash spreading
anti-government protests.
   Today was the fourth day of unrest. Ten people have died since
Saturday, when police used tear gas and gunfire to break up a
pro-democracy rally in the capital of this East African nation.
   The protests quickly spread from Nairobi to other cities.
   President Daniel arap Moi today blamed the riots on ``hooligans
and drug addicts'' and said his government would continue hunting
down instigators. He was addressing Kenyan troops who recently
returned from U.N. peacekeeping duty in Namibia,
   Moi's comment was his first public statement on the situation.
   Fresh clashes between stone-throwing mobs and security forces
were reported this morning in the towns of Kiambu, Nyeri and
Githunguri.
   Violence also was reported from Kangemi and Kawangware,
low-income neighborhoods on Nairobi's western edge, where residents
say security forces beat people throughout the night.
   Nairobi's commercial district, which experienced widespread
violence Saturday and smaller disturbances Sunday, appeared to have
returned to calm.
   Two new fatalities from Monday's fighting were reported today;
one man died of a bullet wound in Githunguri and another was shot
and killed in the northern town of Nakuru.
   Monday, schools sent children home early, and Western embassies
advised their nationals to avoid downtown Nairobi. Public
transportation ground to a halt, and thousands of Nairobi
residents, fearing new violence, fled on foot.
   Dozens of people have been injured since Saturday, many
hospitalized with gunshot wounds, according to newspaper reports
and hospital sources.
   An undisclosed number of people also have been arrested in the
disturbances and at least five foreign journalists have been
detained.
   Since early this year, Moi has come under increasing pressure to
allow multiparty democracy in Kenya, a one-party state that was
long been considered one of Africa's most stable and successful
nations.
   Moi has said a multiparty system could lead to tribal warfare.
   The clashes come against a backdrop of escalating tension with
the United States. On Monday, Kenya condemned the U.S. Embassy for
giving temporary asylum to Gibson Kamau Kuria, a prominent
opposition figure.
   Kuria sought refuge after the government detained dozens of
opponents last week.
   In Washington, Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of state
for African affairs, lodged a protest Monday with Kenyan ambassador
Denis Afande over the East African nation's criticism of the United
States.
   The crackdown in Kenya has prompted a drive in Congress to
freeze or cut U.S. aid in protest, Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said
Monday in Washington.
   The United States is a major donor to Kenya, whose economy is
heavily dependent on foreign aid.
   Last year, the United States gave $61 million in economic aid
and $15 million in military assistance, according to a study by the
Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank.
   The journalists detained include an Associated Press
photographer who was held from midday Saturday until midnight
Sunday. On Monday, journalists for the British Broadcasting Corp.,
the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph and the British television
news service Visnews were held for three hours.

   Snappy dressers beware: A too-tight
necktie can make your head swim and vision blur, says the author of
a book on improving health habits.
   Ties that lack slack can constrict blood flow to the brain and
sensory organs, said Dr. Don R. Powell of the American Institute
for Preventive Medicine.
   He cited 1989 research at Cornell University for the necktie
tip, one of 365 suggestions in his book, ``A Year of Health Hints.''
   ``It can be a problem for people who have to use their eyes in
an important way,'' Powell said Monday, noting that clear vision is
crucial for computer operators, pilots and surgeons.
   Powell suggested buying shirts a half-size bigger in the neck,
leaving the top button undone, tying knots loosely and loosening
the tie throughout the day.
   He also said ``casual days'' at work, when a tie isn't
necessary, would help alleviate the health problem and boost
morale. He said his institute has ``casual Mondays'' and ``casual
weeks'' and is discussing ``casual summers.''

   Syrian President Hafez Assad will visit
Egypt this weekend for the first time in 17 years, officials said
today.
   The move is another step in the thawing of relations between the
Arab nations, which severed ties in December 1977 weeks after
Egypt's then-President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem in a peace
drive that led to the signing of a treaty with Israel in 1979.
   Syria and Egypt resumed diplomatic relations in December and
Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, visited Syria in May to signify
the end of the rift.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Assad
and Mubarak will hold talks in Cairo on Saturday and will travel to
the Mediterranean city of Alexandria for further discussions on
Sunday before the Syrian leader heads home.
   Government officials said the Mubarak-Assad talks will deal with
the stalled Middle East peace process and inter-Arab relations,
including disputes between Syria and both Iraq and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Assad last visited Egypt in 1973 to discuss with Sadat plans for
the war they jointly launched against Israel on Oct. 6, 1973.
   The state-run Middle East News Agency reported that Mubarak will
travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for talks with King Fahd and a
pilgrimage to Islam's holy shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   Mubarak and Fahd have been key figures in efforts to mend a
breach between Syria and Iraq.
   The agency said Mubarak will return home from Saudi Arabia on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Judge Says He's Unlikely To Change Georgia Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge hearing a challenge to Georgia's
election law says it's unlikely he'll do anything to affect next
week's primary because he wasn't asked to until last week.
   A group of black officials, led by state Rep. Tyrone Brooks of
Atlanta, charged in a lawsuit in May that a 1964 rule requiring a
majority vote to win an election is racially discriminatory. The
plaintiffs want to change the rule so the candidate with the most
votes wins, whether it's more than half or not.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman said Monday that though
the suit was filed in May, a motion asking him to rule in time to
eliminate the majority-vote requirement in the July 17 primary was
filed only last week _ ``at the last minute.''
   He indicated he was not likely to agree to the move.
   Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who is trying to become
Georgia's first black governor, is not supporting the Brooks
lawsuit. But political observers say it's a strong possibility
Young could win a plurality in the five-way Democratic primary but
lose a runoff which would be held Aug. 7.
   Freeman did not indicate if he was leaning toward either side in
deciding the lawsuit. But when David Walbert, an attorney
representing the state, asked if today's session could be delayed a
few hours, Freeman responded: ``The longer we wait, the harder it
will be to get this done. ... I don't think it will be done anyway,
to be perfectly frank.''
   Walbert would not comment on the judge's remarks.
   Laughlin McDonald, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
for the Brooks group, said that suing prior to the election gives
the plaintiffs the option, if the judge rules against them, of
challenging the election results.
   The first witness in the hearing Monday was a history and
political science professor from the California Institute of
Technology who testified there were numerous indications that the
Georgia Legislature had racial motivations in enacting the
majority-vote law.
   J. Morgan Kousser, author of a book on Southern politics, said
the law was pushed through the legislature by state Rep. Denmark
Groover, a segregationist, after national civil rights legislation
abolished a system that awarded candidates electoral votes by
county.
   Kousser said there are other signs that lawmakers in 1964 wanted
to keep blacks out of public office, including an attempt to
stiffen the literacy test for voter registration.
   Walbert said the professor was relying too much on second-hand
information, such as old newspaper clippings, to draw his
conclusions.

   Former President Jimmy Carter said
today Africa will remain impoverished unless leaders end wars and
resolve their economic woes.
   Carter told the 26th summit of the 51-member Organization of
African Unity here that he shared Africans' concerns that aid and
investment is being sent from the rich nations to Eastern Europe
and Latin America, not Africa.
   Carter heads Global 2000, a non-profit organization that
sponsors health programs and development projects in Third World
countries.
   Speaking on the second day of the three-day summit, Carter said
health care and food production programs are not being implemented
in areas where there are civil wars.
   Peace efforts, he said, are being thwarted by the reluctance of
bodies like the OAU, the United Nations and the Organization of
American States to intervene in conflicts between ``revolutionary''
groups and unrecognized governments.
   He singled out Liberia, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan,
where populations have been shattered by war.
   Carter lamented that national budgets in poor countries are
mostly used to buy weapons and deploy large armies, gravely
affecting food output and economic growth.
   Last year, Carter chaired inconclusive peace talks between rebel
and government representatives from both Sudan and Ethiopia.
   Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania and a former OAU
chairman, said Africa is the continent hardest hit by economic
recession.
   The continent of 550 million people also suffers from economic
and political domination by the wealthy industrialized north, he
said.
   ``Africa can only survive if we pool our resources,'' Nyerere
said.

   First Lady Barbara Bush says she once encountered
a rat in the White House swimming pool.
   ``It did not look like a Walt Disney rat, I'll tell you that,''
Mrs. Bush told the Houston Post in an interview published today.
``I was out of that pool so much faster than I thought I could.''
   Mrs. Bush, who swims daily for exercise in the heated pool, said
President Bush came to her rescue during the incident a few months
ago.
   ``I swim with a mask, and it just went right by in front of
me,'' she said. ``Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned
the beast. It was horrible.''
   Mrs. Bush said the confrontation with the rat was the worst
experience of her 18 month in the White House.
   The first lady planned to take the wives of other heads of
government attending the seven-nation economic summit on a tour of
the Alamo and other historical sites at San Antonio, Texas.
   Noting the friendly crowds that greeted the Bush motorcade
Monday at the start of the summit talks, Mrs. Bush said, ``I told
George this was the first time I've gone that far in a car ... when
everybody waved and there were no unfriendly gestures.''
   ``It's so wonderful,'' she said. ``George is tickled pink.''
   Mrs. Bush said she and her husband agree that foreign visitors
should see more than the East and West coasts of the United States.
   The president told Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at a
presummit social event last weekend that ``America is not the
coasts. This is America,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``Well, it is. This is
what you want people to see.''

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's president Borisav Jovic
said today the troubled Balkan country may soon hold a national
referendum to decide if the nation's six republics should split
into separate nations.
   ``The right of self-determination, including the right of
secession, is a natural political right of each nationality, which
no one can question,'' Jovic said in a speech to a war veteran's
congress.
   ``This also means that each of our peoples can decide to remain
in the Yugoslav community or leave it,'' said Jovic, the head of
Yugoslavia's eight-member state presidency.
   Yugoslavia's Communist Party continues to run the country on the
federal level, but its authority has been crippled since
center-rignt parties won free elections in the republics of
Slovenia and Croatia earlier this year.
   Open clashes among the republics' leaderships and rising
nationalism in the nation's six republics, two provinces and
numerous ethnic groups have led to fears of a civil war.
   Jovic said the outcome of a nationwide referendum on secession
must be democratic and peaceful since the different nationalities
``will continue to live on these territories, and even if they do
not remain in the same house, they must remain friends.''
   He added ``I deeply believe that Yugoslavia will continue to
exist because we have no better solution.''
   His speech was broadcast live by Belgrade radio.
   Newly-elected non-communist leaderships in Slovenia and Croatia
have demanded that Yugoslavia transform itself into a loose
confederation of semi-independent states, which would cooperate
only if common interests were involved.
   They have indicated that if their demands are not met by the new
Yugoslav constitution, which is currently being drafted, they would
secede.
   Communist leaders in the largest republic, Serbia, have opposed
holding free elections and advocate a federal system with strong
central authority.
   Also today, tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians continued
peaceful demonstrations and strikes throughout the province of
Kosovo to protest Serbia's virtual abolition of the troubled
region's autonomy.
   Witnesses and the state Tanjug news agency said the vast
majority of ethnic Albania's working for state-run companies left
their jobs for a second day and peacefully paraded through the
streets of Kosovo.
   Last Thursday, Serbian authorities disbanded the local
parliament and government after 114 ethnic Albanians announced
plans to declare Kosovo's full autonomy from Serbia. Both
dismantled bodies were dominated by ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of the province's 1.9 million people.

   East German trains stopped operating briefly
today, and gym teachers protested cuts in funding to the physical
education system that produced one of the world's mightiest Olympic
teams, a news agency reported.
   The protests are the newest round in labor unrest following the
economic merger of East Germany and West Germany.
   East Germany's Sports Teachers and Trainers Association called
for nationwide demonstrations next week to protest the ``financial
misery of East German sports,'' East Germany's ADN news agency
reported today.
   Gym teachers claim that a lack of money could soon force the
closure of a string of special sports schools that have helped
produce East German Olympic athletes in areas such as track and
field, swimming and skating.
   ``In the interest of the health of all people ... help us
maintain sports as a part of a cultured society,'' said a pamphlet
distributed by the group.
   East Germany captured 127 medals in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.
   The one-hour warning strike by locomotive drivers halted
virtually all rush-hour train traffic from Rostock in northern East
Germany to Dresden in the southeast, ADN reported.
   In the western region of Magdeburg alone, 33 trains were
canceled or delayed because of the strike.
   Similar disruptions were reported in the East Berlin area, one
of central Europe's most important rail transit points.
   The stoppages followed Monday's deadlock in talks between the
Union of German Locomotive Engineers and Apprentices and the East
German railway system. Union officials had demanded compensation
for the loss of some benefits under the July 1 economic merger.
   East Germany introduced West Germany's mighty deutsche mark as
legal tender July 1 in a prelude to the expected unification of the
two German states.
   The move unleashed a nationwide wave of industrial unrest by
workers demanding the same high salaries as their West German
counterparts.
   Experts have predicted as many as one-third of East Germany's
8,000 businesses could fold and up to half of its 8 million workers
could lose their jobs as competition from West Germany begins to
take its toll on the East German economy.
   Monday, dairy farmers protesting plans to reform East Germany's
Soviet-style collective farming system dumped milk outside a
government building in the southern city of Leipzig, ADN said.
   The farmers threatened to take their protest to East Berlin and
empty an entire milk truck there unless their demands were met, ADN
reported.

   Mark Turner thought it would be a
nice touch to attach his birthday gift for his wife _ a diamond and
ruby ring _ to a bouquet of helium balloons.
   But the ring was blown away by high wind when Turner attempted
to bring them into the house from his car Saturday.
   ``When he opened the door, he went to grab them and out they
went,'' Sue Ann Turner said Monday.
   The family contacted police and radio stations in hopes of
getting back the white and yellow gold ring with its arrangement of
diamonds and rubies.
   ``The stones were sentimental because they were from her 16th
birthday and engagement,'' said Mrs. Turner's mother, Jackie
Schlosser.
   Hope soared when a farmer near the community of Ladd notified
the family that he had found the balloons in a soybean field.
   But the ring and birthday card were nowhere to be seen.
   Now, the family is trying to hire a psychic, Greta Alexander of
Delavan.
   ``I'm hoping she will pin it down,'' Mrs. Turner said. ``She
finds things all the time so maybe she'll know where to look.''
   The Turners couldn't estimate the ring's worth, but they were
offering a small reward, said Schlosser.

   A precise location of the hydrogen leak that
grounded the space shuttle still eludes NASA engineers, but
officials are looking for a test on space shuttle Atlantis later
this week to provide answers.
   A laboratory test in California over the weekend gave
confirmation that there is a problem in the design or assembly of a
liquid hydrogen plumbing system on the shuttle, space agency
officials said Monday.
   William Lenoir, space flight director for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the leak found in a test
at the Rockwell International plant in Downey, Calif., was similar
to the one detected earlier on space shuttle Columbia.
   But he said it did not pinpoint the precise seal, pipe or valve
that is leaking.
   ``It looks like it's not out of line from what we saw on the
pad,'' Lenoir told reporters. He called the finding ``good news.''
   ``My biggest fear was that we would go through the Downey test
and get no leak at all,'' said Lenoir. ``I'm encouraged.''
   Lenoir and NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk were testifying
today before the Senate science, technology and space subcommittee
about problems besetting NASA.
   While Lenoir was to be quizzed about the space shuttle leak,
Fisk faced questions about why the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope was launched into orbit with a irrepairable fuzzy focus.
The telescope flaw was found two weeks ago and NASA has convened an
investigative board.
   Others witnesses at the hearing were expected to include
officials of Hughes Danbury Optical Co., the firm that made the
flawed mirrors on Hubble.
   Meanwhile, at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, two veteran
astronauts were grounded for involvment in hazardous flying
incidents, including one in which another pilot died.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson was grounded for a year
after being involved in a collision during an air race in Central
Texas. The pilot of the other aircraft crashed and died. Gibson
landed safely.
   A NASA announcement said Gibson will not fly the space shuttle
or the T-38 trainer jet for a year. Gibson had been assigned to
command a shuttle mission next year, but NASA said a new commander
would be selected.
   Navy Cmdr. David M. Walker was suspended from flying the T-38
jet for 60 days and replaced as commander of a military shuttle
mission scheduled for next year. NASA took the action, officials
said, because Walker flew too close to an airliner near Washington,
D.C. in 1988.
   Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory will replace Walker as crew
commander on the shuttle flight.
   At his news conference Monday, Lenoir said NASA engineers plan a
full-scale leak test on Atlantis on Friday or Saturday. The test
will be performed while the space shuttle sits on the launch pad
and will closely duplicate the conditions that resulted in both the
Columbia leak in May and the leak found on Atlantis in June.
   After the second leak, NASA halted space shuttle launches until
the problem is fixed.
   The Rockwell test over the weekend used plumbing hardware called
an umbilical that had been taken from Columbia after its leak was
found. Engineers forced liquid hydrogen through the umbilical and
maintained a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch. They then
measured any hydrogen that leaked.
   Lenoir said the leak amounted to 5,000 to 10,000 cubic inches of
hydrogen per minute. The Columbia leak in May had been about 90,000
cubic inches per minute.
   A hole the size of a pinhole, about 40,000th of an inch, would
be large enough to create such a leak in the liquid hydrogen
system, he said.
   For Atlantis' test, engineers at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida stripped away insulation and exposed the bare metal of the
umbilical. They are installing special instruments and sensors, and
attaching plastic bags to areas of the pipe assembly that could be
leaking.
   When all is ready, hydrogen, chilled to a liquid at minus 423
degrees, will be pumped through the pipes at the rate of more than
80 gallons a minute.
   By analyzing gas captured by the bags and readings on the
sensors, the experts hope to find the exact location of the leak.
   Lenoir said the ``prime suspect'' for the source of the leak is
a U-shaped Teflon seal that is supposed to keep hydrogen from
escaping from the disconnect joint.
   He said the tolerances for the seal and for the groove that
holds it are extremely tight and there could be just enough of a
misfit to cause a leak.
   If this is confirmed as the problem, Lenoir said there is a
possibility it could be fixed in time for Atlantis to fly in August.
   But Robert Crippen, director of the space shuttle program, said
engineers still have not pinpointed the leak source.
   ``We really do not know what the problem is yet,'' he said at
the news conference with Lenoir. ``We haven't eliminated anything
yet.''
   While the leak test on Atlantis may give answers, Crippen warned
that it could also raise more questions.
   ``We have not eliminated the possibility that we might have two
different problems on the two different vehicles,'' he said.

   A woman who said she wanted attention
held seven bank employees hostage for more than four hours before
one of them overpowered her, authorities said.
   Although Vicki Molina, 37, told police she had a grenade, a bomb
and a gun during Monday's standoff at an NCNB branch, she was
unarmed when arrested and charged with nine counts of false
imprisonment.
   ``She had something to prove to someone, we don't know whom,''
said North Miami police Lt. Nancy McCue. ``She said she was not
there to rob the bank. It was some personal problem she had. ...
She said she wanted attention.''
   Mrs. Molina has undergone periodic psychiatric treatment for the
past 15 years and her actions were not believed triggered by any
specific incident, McCue said.
   Witnesses said the bank manager announced there was a bomb
threat and everyone should leave, but the woman insisted some
employees stay behind.
   About 4 p.m., the hostage taker exhorted police to kill her or
she would start killing the hostages. That's when bank vice
president Clinton Green, 48, lunged at the woman, pinned her
against the wall and allowed the hostages to escape, police said.
   Metro-Dade Special Response Team officers moved in and subdued
the woman. She remained in the Dade County jail today under a
suicide watch.

<HEAD>Bankers Plead Guilty To Embezzling Money Spent at Topless Bar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors say two bankers who
embezzled more than $67,000 spent more than $46,000 of the money at
a topless bar.
   Ted W. Cook, 45, of Garden Ridge and John E. Buratovich, 33, of
Kirby pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy to defraud the
government. The pleas came as lawyers prepared to select a jury and
prosecutors were poised to present testimony from two exotic
dancers.
   U.S. District Judge D.W. Suttle scheduled sentencing for Sept.
12.
   Federal prosecutors said Cook, former president of the suburban
Garden Ridge State Bank, obtained a corporate credit card without
the knowledge or approval of the bank's board of directors.
   Cook and Buratovich, a former vice president of the bank, were
accused of using the card to buy goods and services ``of a personal
and private nature.'' The expenditures were various night clubs,
restaurants and hotels, mostly in the San Antonio area, between
Nov. 1, 1985, and Aug. 22, 1989, prosecutors said.
   FBI officials who investigated the case said that of the $67,375
the men charged on the card, more than $46,000 was spent at
Ziegfeld's Gentleman's Club, a topless bar.
   Cook and Buratovich allegedly reported to bank directors that
some officers had higher salaries than they actually received and
then using the excess money to pay off the credit card.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York is Democratic Chairman Ronald Brown's
choice as the host city for the party's 1992 convention, party
sources say.
   The choice, which the sources aid Brown revealed to top aides
Monday, is no surprise _ New York was Brown's favorite from the
start of the search, which came down to that city and New Orleans.
   Brown plans to make his choice public on Wednesday in
Washington. Party spokeswoman Ginny Terzano refused to comment on
the sources' accounts, except to say that Brown had made his
decision. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The early choice of a convention site by Democrats comes as the
Republican Party is just beginning its search. Houston, President
Bush's adopted hometown, is among the cities seeking to host the
GOP gathering.
   New York hosted the Democratic conventions in 1976 and 1980.
Mayor David Dinkins made a strong pitch on behalf of his city's
1992 effort, beginning his lobbying last year during a party
meeting in Indianapolis.
   New York's Madison Square Garden is too small to serve as both
convention hall and media center, but the city proposed using
another hall several blocks away as a work area for reporters.
   The city also said it could afford the $20 million commitment
sought by the party, and Democratic fund-raisers in New York
promised to aggressively raise money for the 1992 campaign.
   New Orleans, which hosted the 1988 Republican convention, was
the other finalist to emerge from Brown's site selection committee.
But party insiders said Brown appeared set on New York from the
outset, and any hopes for New Orleans were undermined by the
Louisiana legislature's passage of a strict anti-abortion measure
last weekend.
   The Democratic Party backs abortion rights and its candidates in
several 1989 elections successfully used the issue against GOP
opponents. Brown said last week the Louisiana legislation was a
factor in his deliberations; party sources said then that New York
was the choice unless negotiations collapsed.
   The Republican Party isn't expected to complete its search for
several months, with a decision expected in January. The search
would be moot should Bush express a preference, but for now the
competitors include Houston, Cleveland, San Diego, New Orleans,
Miami, Anaheim, Calif., and St. Petersburg, Fla. New York also was
interested in the GOP event and it was not immediately clear if
landing the Democratic convention would affect that bid.

<TEXT>
   Gunfire crackled in the streets today
and backers of a spreading and violent strike rebuilt street
barricades that police and the army had dismantled overnight.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro called on the army to end
bloody clashes between her supporters and Sandinistas backing a
week-old general strike that is the stiffest threat yet to her
U.S.-backed government.
   At least three people were reported killed in earlier gunfire.
More were reported wounded overnight but the extent of the
casualties was not immediately clear.
   Most government ministries and state-owned businesses remained
in the control of pro-Sandinista strikers today.
   Bonfires burned at many key intersections, and the highway to
the airport was blocked by barricades of paving stones and other
obstacles. Most Managuans who went to work walked.
   The army is dominated by the Sandinistas and it was not yet
clear whether soldiers would take up arms against compatriots who
have organized the crippling strikes and fought Chamorro backers
with fists, rocks and guns.
   Armored cars patrolled the streets of Managua and gunfire could
be heard during the night, but reporters could not get close to the
fighting.
   The violence began Sunday evening and intensified Monday.
   Police said the dead included a man fatally shot in a clash
between government supporters and Sandinistas. They said about 100
people had been injured; hospitals reported much lower casualty
figures.
   The strikes and street violence have brought the country to a
near standstill.
   In scenes reminiscent of the 1979 revolution that brought them
to power, the Sandinistas built smoky bonfires of trash and tires
all over Managua on Monday and erected barricades.
   A haze hung over the capital, a city of 1 million people.
Electricity and drinking water were cut off in most of Managua.
Mail and operator-assisted telephone calls were suspended.
   There was virtually no bus service, and state-run cooperatives
and other agricultural installations, textile and construction
plants were idle.
   Striking air traffic controllers shut down the the international
airport and the road to Managua was blockaded by protesters. The
police tore down their barricades with backhoes; the demonstrators
put them up again.
   Mrs. Chamorro, facing the worst crisis of her 10-week-old
presidency, made a nationally broadcast appeal for calm on Monday
night. She begged compatriots not to answer ``violence with
violence, which has already claimed victims.''
   The Sandinistas, though, renewed their strike calls and warned
the government was courting ``chaos and a catastrophe.''
   Sandinista-controlled unions say Mrs. Chamorro is firing too
many people from government jobs as she tries to reduce the budget
deficit. They also object to her plans to sell dozens of
state-owned companies and farms that the Sandinistas had
expropriated from the wealthy.
   The Sandinistas held power for a decade, warring nearly all the
while with the U.S.-backed Contras who sought to topple them and
suffering economic hardship as the result of a U.S. trade embargo.
   Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition unseated the Sandinists in
elections Feb. 25 and the Contras disarmed last month.
   The Sandinistas remain the single biggest party in Nicaragua,
while the president's coalition has been splintered by infighting
and weakened by popular discontent over economic hardship.
   Sandinista-controlled unions called a strike on June 26.
Spiralling walkouts paralyzed government offices and banks and
curtailed services including transportation, telephones, water and
power.
   Strike leaders claim more than 80,000 public and private sector
workers have joined in the walkouts.
   The strikes escalated into street fighting, and that's when Mrs.
Chamorro called out the army to help police restore order.
   In her speech, Mrs. Chamorro accused the Sandinistas of
engineering the strikes and the unrest.
   The president's speech on state radio and television was delayed
for four hours when pro-Sandinista students and workers seized a
government broadcasting center. Police dispersed them peacefully
after about two hours.
   Mrs. Chamorro said her government was committed to national
reconciliation, but insisted that it occur in ``a climate of peace
and understanding, not fear of intimidation.''
   The Sandinistas, however, said the government would be
``directly responsible for creating chaos and a catastrophe'' if it
failed to negotiate with the strike leaders. Talks broke down last
week.
   Former President Daniel Ortega, too, urged negotiations.
   ``This conflict cannot be solved by force. Any attempt in that
direction is an invitation to chaos,'' he said in a radio interview
Monday.

   The setting was wild but the crowd was
tame as campers began arriving for an annual gathering of Earth
First!, a group known for its militant approach to defending nature.
   ``We just wanted to learn more about Earth First!'' said
chiropractor Gary Robb, who hitchhiked about 1,000 miles from
Canada with his son, Travis, 15, for a week of music, dance and
environmental activism in a meadow south of Cameron.
   Battered cars bulging with camping gear and Volkswagen buses
carried aging or fledgling hippies to within half a mile of the
Round River Rendezvous at Beaverhead National Forest. The campout
site is in the foothills of Gravelly Range about 25 miles west of
Yellowstone National Park.
   Up to 500 Earth First! members were expected for the 11th annual
meeting of the organization.
   Police, wary of counterdemonstrators and the movement's
reputation for civil disobedience, said they will keep an eye on
the proceedings. But no officers were in sight Monday.
   Robert Kellog, a Forest Service law enforcement officer, said
Earth First! meetings have not been a problem in the past and
``there's no reason to expect they will this time.''
   Participants said they were there to learn and enjoy themselves.
   ``It's the camaraderie more than anything,'' said Mitch
Friedman, a biologist from Bellingham, Wash. ``I'm looking forward
to the workshops, but I'm really looking forward to seeing my
friends.''
   ``There's a big piece of wild country here and we're trying to
keep it wild,'' said Philip Knight, who helped organize the Round
River Rendezvous, which opened Monday. ``That's why we're here.''
   Robb and his son, from Salt Spring Island in British Columbia,
began hitchhiking more than two weeks ago. They painted a house in
nearby Ennis to earn some traveling money, and hiked into the
snow-tipped Madison Range while waiting for the event to start.
   The atmosphere was alternately festive and serious. At a
``first-timer'' meeting, about 75 members discussed the group's
image and the hazards of environmental activism.
   ``Even if we are fringe, we need to get our message out: that
there are people who would destroy our land for a greasy dollar
bill,'' said Bob Kasper, a mail carrier from Madison, Wis. ``Ours
is not an evil group that is trying to destroy the country.''
   Some Earth First! publications have advocated
``monkey-wrenching'' _ acts of sabotage against those who develop
the nation's wildlands. But members say the group takes no official
stance on such activity and that its members are mostly involved in
acts of civil disobedience.
   A workshop on non-violent protest tactics is on the agenda.
   Earth Firsters have chained themselves to tree-crushing machines
in Texas, blocked logging roads in Washington, and occupied
road-building equipment in Arizona. This summer in Northern
California, more than 50 have been arrested for blockading sawmills
and picketing government offices to protest the cutting of
old-growth redwoods.
   Some authorities say the group is more destructive when nobody's
looking.
   Two activists were injured May 24 in Oakland when a pipe bomb
exploded in the back seat of their car.
   Last year in Arizona, three other activists allegedly cut
through the leg of an electric transmission tower, and the FBI
claimed they were practicing for an assault against nuclear
facilities in California and Colorado.
   Earth First! co-founder Dave Foreman also was arrested on
charges that he helped plan the scheme. All four have denied the
charges; Foreman faces trial in September.

   The head of the joint chiefs of

this capital, authorities reported today.
   The Modesto Ramirez Front _ urban commandos of the leftist rebel
army battling the government _ claimed responsibility for Monday
night's assassination of Maj. Carlos Figueroa in telephone calls to
local radio stations. The guerrillas did not say why Figueroa was
selected as a target.
   Also today, judicial authorities reported the arraignment of
former immigration director Col. Maximiliano Leiva, who is accused
of heading a ring that helped smuggle Chinese nationals bound for
the United States.
   Leiva was removed from his post and detained last weekend
following the discovery of 52 Chinese _ 50 from mainland China and
two from Taiwan _ in a house in an affluent residential
neighborhood. The Chinese reportedly paid $20,000 to authorities in
several countries for false documents.

<DATELINE>VELIKO TURNOVO, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's first multiparty
parliament in 44 years held its inaugural session today in the
absence of former President Petar Mladenov, who resigned after
admitting he proposed using force to crush pro-democracy protests.
   The opening ceremony was held in a wood-paneled hall in this
ancient Bulgarian capital, about 150 miles northeast of Sofia.
   Mladenov resigned Friday under mounting public pressure for
suggesting in December that tanks be used to disperse some 50,000
anti-Communist demonstrators.
   His departure came less than three weeks after his party of
reformed Communists won the country's first free elections in 58
years.
   Mladenov was instrumental in last year's ousting of Communist
strongman Todor Zhivkov. Prodded by popular demonstrations,
Mladenov then played a key role in reforming the party, now known
as the Socialist Party.
   His departure has weakened the ruling Socialists and created a
constitutional vacuum.
   The Grand National Assembly's first task will be to agree on a
presidential candidate and on how to elect him. There is no
precedent for electing a president in Bulgaria's parliamentary
history.
   The 400-member parliament may either decide to elect the
president or call a referendum.
   The ceremonial opening session, held in sweltering heat, was
adjourned after only 40 minutes and will be resumed on July 17 at
the parliament building in Sofia.
   The meeting was inaugurated by Yosif Petrov, at 81 the oldest
deputy.
   In a brief speech, Alexander Lilov, chairman of the Socialist
Party, said: ``The time of the totalitarian parliament is over. Now
is the time of the democratic parliament.''
   But Lilov also criticized protesters.
   ``We are against chaos and destabilization in the country,'' he
said. ``Everyone has the right to protest, but everyone has also
the obligation to work.''
   Police and special security forces patrolled the area outside
the meeting, but there were no incidents.

<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross failed to notify
federal authorities about 230 cases in which patients may have
contracted AIDS through contaminated blood transfusions, a
newspaper reported today.
   In at least four cases, patients died as a result of
contaminated blood, but the federal Food and Drug Administration
was not informed, The Philadelphia Inquirer said.
   The newspaper report did not say how many of the 230 cases
involved people actually getting AIDS.
   The newspaper said it obtained a report of an FDA inspection of
the Red Cross' national headquarters in Washington, D.C., that was
carried out between April 26 and May 25.
   It said the agency found that the Red Cross lacked procedures
``for reviewing and tracking transfusion-associated AIDS cases by
national (headquarters) to assure all regions are submitting the
initial reports and follow-up reports are complete.''
   The FDA report also said that national Red Cross officials have
not updated their procedures for handling error and accident
reports since July 1981, calling those procedures inadequate.
   The FDA report said the 230 cases occurred in the Washington,
D.C., area and that there were also 380 cases where national Red
Cross officials failed to review reports of errors and accidents at
Red Cross blood centers nationwide.
   The newspaper did not indicate what years the cases occurred.
Blood and blood components have been screened for AIDS antibodies
since March 1985.
   Under federal law, the FDA may require the Red Cross to correct
the deficiencies, or either suspend or revoke its license to
collect and distribute blood.
   Errors at Red Cross blood centers around the country ranged from
potentially dangerous donors not being excluded to the release of
blood that initially tested positive for AIDS antibodies but was
later found to be negative, the newspaper said, quoting from the
FDA report.
   A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has
scheduled a hearing Friday to investigate the safety of the
American blood supply.
   The Red Cross supplies more than half of all the blood used by
American hospitals. Its 54 regional centers collect and distribute
more than 6 million units of blood.
   Diane Powers, spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Washington, said
this morning that no one was available to respond to the report.
Other officials said a staff meeting was under way this morning at
which the report was discussed.

   Soviet guards seized a Norwegian man Tuesday
in the second arctic border incident between the two countries in
less than a week, Norwegian authorities reported.
   The man waded across the Grense Jakobselv river into Soviet
territory, probably while fishing, said Hugo Overgaard, the
Norwegian border commissioner. The man was not publicly identified.
   Tourists often inadvertently violate the border by wandering
across the shallow river, Overgaard told the Norwegian news agency
NTB, ``but it has been a very long time since one was arrested.''
   Wayward tourists are customarily returned to their home country,
Overgaard said. The man could face a fine of up to $395 in Norway.
   On Thursday, Norwegian fisherman Werner Pedersen claimed a
five-man Soviet border patrol shot at him and chased him 110 yards
into Norwegian territory. He was not injured.
   The Soviets said Pedersen was fishing on their side of the river
and was chased back into Norway.
   Overgaard told newspapers that a Norwegian re-enactment of the
incident supported Pedersen's claim. Norway protested the incident
to the Soviets over the weekend.

   Wildlife officials Tuesday were
investigating the shooting of a 14-foot crocodile named Old Slimy,
whose disappearance has outraged tour operators on the Daintree
River.
   The crocodile, one of the largest known on the river, was
regularly seen for nearly 10 years, said Lee Lafferty, manager of
the Daintree River and Reef Cruise Center in northern Queensland
state. It was estimated to be 15 to 20 years old.
   But it has not been sighted since it was shot Saturday
afternoon, shortly after a tour vessel had shown the reptile to a
group of tourists.
   ``Some mindless hoon snuck up on the croc and shot it,''
Lafferty said.
   A National Parks and Wildlife Service spokesman said the
offender could face a fine of up to $4,800, 12 months in prison or
both.
   Tour operators and some bus companies offered a reward for
information leading to the culprit's capture, said Margaret
Patterson from the Daintree River Train.
   ``It had been here so long that it is like losing a member of
the family, everyone is really upset,'' she said.

   Militant Cuban exile Orlando Bosch today rejected a
government offer to trade prison for a restrictive house-arrest
program that would return him to his family after the past 14 years
in jails.
   Bosch said the offer would require him to tell the FBI of any
contacts with Cuban exile groups that advocate violence, said his
daughter, Myriam.
   ``He's willing to agree to all of the conditions except that
one,'' Ms. Bosch said. ``He's not going be an informant. The FBI
can do their own work.''
   Ms. Bosch said her father informed his attorneys of his decision
this morning, and they were to notify immigration officials.
   A source with the Justice Department said the government will
not negotiate the offer. ``Bosch won't accept the conditions, and
he won't be released unless he does,'' the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The proposal presented to Bosch by immigration officials Monday
night was a departure for the Justice Department, which has
maintained for years that the anti-Castro activist would continue
his terrorist ways if released.
   ``He's just not prepared to send a message out that he's an
informant,'' said attorney Henry Adorno. ``He believes that lists
are kept by people like Joe McCarthy and Fidel Castro.''
   On Monday, Bosch's wife, Adriana, had criticized the conditions
for his release, but appeared to encourage him to accept the deal,
calling the conditions ``better than jail.''
   The 63-year-old former pediatrician suffers from ulcers and
declining health after years in Venezuelan and U.S. jails.
   The conditions would have required Bosch to wear an electronic
monitoring device, remain at home for 21 hours a day, keep a log of
visitors and allow his telephone to be monitored, said Richard
Smith, director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
in Miami.
   Smith said Bosch also would be subject to unannounced searches
and lie detector tests, and if instructed, must present himself for
deportation within 72 hours.
   ``They're just messing with his head,'' Myriam Bosch said.
``Knowing how they work, I think they probably did this knowing my
father would not accept it.''
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian in Washington said the
government decided to offer Bosch parole for humanitarian reasons,
but will continue the two-year effort to deport him. Thus far, 31
nations have refused to accept him.
   The offer appeared to be an attempt to resolve what has become a
cause celebre for Miami's staunchly anti-Castro Cuban exile
community, which has held rallies and demonstrations on his behalf.
   Bosch has been held since 1988, when he was arrested for parole
violations and for reentering the country illegally.
   According to CIA documents, he ran bombing runs on Cuba in the
early 1960s. In 1968, he was convicted in a bazooka attack on a
Polish freighter at the Port of Miami and sentenced to 10 years in
prison.
   He was paroled in 1972 and fled the country in 1974 after he was
subpoenaed to testify in an inquiry into the killing of a Miami
exile leader.
   Accused of masterminding the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner
that killed 73 people, Bosch spent 11 years in Venezuelan jails. He
denied involvement in the bombing and was acquitted in three
separate trials.
   The parole conditions would require Bosch to wear an electronic
monitoring device, remain at home for 21 hours a day, keep a log of
visitors and allow his telephone to be monitored, said Richard
Smith, director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
in Miami.

<HEAD>Opponents of Collaboration Honored On Vichy's 50th Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France observed the 50th anniversary of the
formation of the collaborationist Vichy government Tuesday and
honored the Parliament members who opposed Marshal Philippe
Petain's ascension to power.
   Petain, a grandfatherly World War I hero, was installed as
all-powerful leader of the Vichy regime by a 569-80 vote on July
10, 1940.
   Three of the legislators who voted ``no'' survive, and two
attended commemorations at Vichy's Grand Casino, where the vote was
taken. Maurice Montel, 90, and Emile Fouchard, 88, were joined by
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jean Poperen.
   Poperen said the 80 lawmakers, acting ``with lucidity and
courage, against all the appearances and the evidence of the
moment, have earned the eternal recognition of the nation.''
   Vichy's mayor, Claude Malhuret, described the votes against
Petain as ``one of the first acts of resistance in our country.''
   Malhuret also said France should be vigilant in countering a
resurgence of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric ``such as we heard
before the war.''
   Petain, who signed an armistice with the Germans on June 22, was
84 at the time, but widely respected across France. He was
convinced Germany would win the war and that France had no
alternative but to cooperate with Hitler.
   France's government, including Parliament members, had fled from
Paris as German forces approached, going first to Tours on June 10,
then to Bordeaux on June 14 and two weeks later to Vichy, a
tranquil health spa.
   On July 10, the parliamentary majority adopted a text which
said: ``The National Assembly gives all power to the government of
the Republic, under the authority and the signature of Marshal
Petain, for the purpose of promoting a new constitution of the
French state.''
   Of the 80 legislators who opposed Petain, 31 were incarcerated
or put under house arrest during the war, two were killed and five
died in captivity.
   Since the war, Vichy has struggled to live down its association
with Nazi collaboration.
   In the 1930s, the town ranked as France's No. 1 mineral springs
resort. Now it ranks 14th, and unemployment in the town of 30,500
is estimated at 15 percent.
   Malhuret described as ``irritating'' the link between Vichy and
the collaborationists.
   ``If the town of Vichy was partly responsible, it would be less
irritating,'' he told the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
``But that isn't the case. Nobody in Vichy went out in search of
the government and the assembly.''
   The Vichy government received little in return for its
collaboration, exporting goods and labor to Germany in exchange for
the privilege of running day-to-day administrative affairs. Only
two-fifths of France was under Vichy's jurisdiction, the rest was
occupied territory.
   In August 1944, as Allied forces swept through France, Petain
fled Vichy and was arrested, then was allowed to leave for
Switzerland.
   He returned voluntarily to France in April 1945, was tried for
treason and sentenced to death. Charles De Gaulle commuted the
sentence to life imprisonment and Petain died in 1951 on the Isle
of Yeu, off France's Atlantic coast.
   In Paris, officials of the French Communist Party on Tuesday
celebrated the 50th anniversary of an appeal by the outlawed
Communist underground for resistance against Petain.
   Communist legislator Andre Lajoinie said the men who isssud the
appeal represented ``the first resistance base on national
territory.'' A radio appeal for Frenchmen to resist the Nazis had
been broadcast from London on June 18 by De Gaulle.

<HEAD>Ship Sets Sail Years After Radiation Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen years after a radiation leak halted its
maiden voyage, the experimental ship Mutsu set out Tuesday for its
first attempt to sail under nuclear power, officials said.
   Technical problems and anti-nuclear protests that complicated
anchorage and repair arrangements for Japan's only nuclear-powered
ship accounted for the delay.
   Local police said 23 anti-nuclear activists protested the
Mutsu's planned test by burning old tires on nearby shores as it
sailed from Sekinehama port in Aomori prefecture, 360 miles
northeast of Tokyo.
   The 8,242-ton ship used an auxiliary boiler as it headed for an
area about 108 miles off the Pacific coast, said Yuwao Ikezawa,
spokesman of the Atomic Energy Research Institute.
   Tests of its nuclear reactor were to start Friday, and a series
of ocean trials lasting about 20 days will be conducted in an area
where they would not hinder fishing operations, Ikezawa added.
   He said the reactor's output would be raised to 50 percent of
full capacity in the first week and to 70 percent for another week
to make sure the reactor was working properly.
   Before this year, the Mutsu's 36,000-kilowatt reactor had not
been used since a leak was discovered in its protective shield just
after it set out in 1974 for its maiden voyage. The ship was
launched in 1969.
   After that leak was reported, the research vessel drifted for 50
days in the Pacific before residents of its home port in Aomori
prefecture allowed it to return temporarily.
   After extensive repairs and remodeling of parts including the
defective shielding, the ship had been anchored at Sekinehama since
1988.
   Institute officials have said that if the forthcoming tests go
smoothly, the ship will make another test voyage in August and then
a yearlong experimental voyage to collect data for possible future
development of nuclear-powered commercial vessels.
   Following the tests, the Mutsu is to be retired.

   Using torture, murder and mass arrests,
governments trampled the human rights of tens of thousands of
people in 1989 to suppress conflicts stemming from ethnic or
nationalist tensions, Amnesty International said.
   Despite democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe, reform in
South Africa and signs of change in some black African countries,
Amnesty's annual world survey of human rights painted a grim
picture. Its report was to be released Wednesday.
   Cases cited in the human rights group's 138-country report
ranged from children tortured in Iraq to a Spaniard sentenced for
burning the flag; from alleged racial bias in American capital
punishment to the jailing of Malawi's only neurosurgeon for
criticizing the president; from death squads in El Salvador to
draft refusers in Western Europe.
   The theme of this year's report was ``the suppression of ethnic
and nationalist groups,'' which Amnesty said has often ``served to
entrench bitter conflicts, dimmed prospects for dialogue and added
to the toll of suffering and death.''
   The survey saw this pattern in countries including Somalia,
Ethiopia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, India, Burma, Indonesia, the Soviet
Union, Yugoslavia, Tibet, Chad, Mauritania, Israel, Iran, Iraq,
Turkey, Bulgaria, Guatemala and Brazil.
   ``Around the world, particularly where the tensions erupted into
violence, tens of thousands of people became victims of security
operations resulting in `disappearances' and extrajudicial
executions,'' the report said.
   ``The conflicts ranged from local disputes over the cultural
rights of distinctive ethnic groups through to full-scale
confrontation over demands for autonomy or secession,'' it said.
   The demands were often non-violent, but in many instances,
violent attacks or armed insurgency were dominant features, the
report said.
   Amnesty International said it recognized that governments faced
complex situations and, in some cases, armed groups which
kidnapped, tortured and murdered opponents.
   But it said: ``None of these factors can every justify or excuse
a government violating the basic human rights of any of its
citizens or those over whom it exercises control.''
   It said police and military forces in several western hemisphere
nations dramatically increased their attacks on political opponents
in 1989.
   In Eastern Europe, it said, new governments have emptied their
prisons of dissidents, but it said dissenters are still harshly
treated in Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
   In the Middle East and North Africa, it said, killings, mass
arrests and torture of political opponents continued, but there
were also some signs of improvement.
   Governments in Asia have resorted to mass killings, torture,
detentions and unfair trials to repress mass opposition movements,
the report said.
   ``Prisoners of conscience in Asia ranged from a Buddhist monk in
Vietnam to a 52-year-old doctor in Indonesia,'' it said.
   At least 1,000 people were killed and thousands were wounded
when troops fired on crowds of unarmed protesters and bystanders in
Beijing in June 1989 to suppress pro-democracy demonstrations, the
report said, adding that ``an atmosphere of terror'' prevented any
accurate count of the number of deaths. ``Dozens were publicly
reported to have been sentenced to death or to terms of
imprisonment after summary and unfair trials, and there were
reports of secret executions,'' the report added.
   Only a few dozen executions in connection with the protests were
reported publicly, but unofficial sources estimated several hundred
people were executed secretly in Beijing after June 4, 1989, the
report said.
   Thousands of people were arrested and held incommunicado, the
report said. This year, Chinese authorities have announced the
release of at least 784 prisoners.
   On a positive note, Amnesty International noted the release of
political prisoners in Benin, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Africa and
Namibia, and significant reductions in executions in South Africa
and Nigeria.
   But in some cases, relaxations soon gave way to renewed
repression, it said.

   The State Department said Tuesday that it is
advising American citizens to defer all non-essential travel to
Kenya because of anti-government protests there.
   A department statement said recent demonstrations, accompanied
by looting and clashes between police and rioters, have made
conditions unsafe for travelers.
   While the largest demonstrations have occurred in the Nairobi
area, the potential exists for disturbances elsewhere, the
statement said.
   Americans who must travel to Kenya were advised to contact the
American Embassy or Consulate on arrival.
   The protests began Saturday, when police used tear gas and
gunfire to break up a pro-democracy rally in Nairobi, the capital
of the East African nation.

   Amnesty International's annual world survey of
human rights highlighted these instances of ethnic or nationalist
tensions being met by government repression:
   _ Thousands of Sri Lankans were reported to have ``disappeared''
or were summarily executed by government troops and paramilitary
allies fighting an armed Tamil rebellion.
   _ In Somalia, 46 members of the Issaq clan, including children,
reportedly were murdered by government soldiers in July. Similar
reprisals were reported against members of the Ogadeni clan after a
rebellion by Ogadeni soldiers.
   _ Forty-two members of the Dinka and Nuber communities in Sudan
reportedly were summarily executed in October, and members of the
Dinka, Nuber, Nuer and Shilluk communities have suffered gross
human rights violations ``solely because of their ethnic origin.''
   _ Twenty people were killed when Soviet troops broke up a
peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi, Georgia in April, and police and
troops assaulted an unarmed crowd of about 1,000 people in the
western Ukraine in October.
   _ An unknown number of Tibetans were killed and more than 1,000
arrested when Chinese troops broke up an independence demonstration
in Tibet in March 1989 and imposed martial law. Amnesty
International said there were many reports of torture involving
beatings, electric shocks and hanging by the arms.
   _ Israeli troops killed more than 260 unarmed Palestinians in
the occupied territories, and 13,000 Palestinians were held in
prisons or detention camps.
   _ Kurds have been subject to brutal treatment in Iraq, Iran and
Turkey, the report said. Seven Kurds who surrendered to Iraqi
authorities during an amnesty in February were executed, the report
said, and Kurds were victims of a wave of secret executions in Iran
that ended in January 1989.
   _ The report challenged the tactics used against the Irish
Republican Army's armed campaign to drive Britain out of Northern
Ireland. Amnesty International renewed its demand for judicial
inquiries into several killings of IRA suspects by British security
forces, claiming they were not adequately investigated.

<TEXT>
   Next to the cover page of this book is a
photograph of President Eisenhower's five-star tie with a stain
circled and a note informing inquiring readers what the stain is.
   The stain came from Ike's vegetable soup _ and the recipe can be
found on page 40 of this oversized 118-page volume.
   ``Ike the Cook,'' by Edward and Candace Russoli, includes 32
recipes by the nation's 34th president, and many anecdotes about
his culinary skills, which apparently were considerable.
   It also has 172 photographs, including many with Eisenhower
donning an apron or eating some of his own creations.
   From a young Kansan cooking squirrel during a camp out, to an
Army officer who believed food was part of a soldier's paycheck and
finally to a kitchen-wise president, the Russolis tell the story of
Eisenhower' life _ through food.
   Ed Russoli admits it is a novel approach to a presidential
biography.
   ``We're using food as a vehicle throughout the book,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
   Russoli is himself a gourmet cook and one-time owner of an
Italian restaurant in his native Allentown, Pa.
   The recipes in the book came from Secret Service agents who
guarded Eisenhower, Columbia University in New York _ where
Eisenhower briefly served as president _ and from the Eisenhower
Library in Abilene.
   In fact, Eisenhower's recipe for homemade vegetable soup created
quite a stir when it was published in a 1948 campus cookbook at
Columbia University while Eisenhower was president.
   ``He later said he got more reaction from his recipe for
vegetable soup than anything else he said while president of
Columbia,'' Russoli said.
   The ``secret ingredient'' in Eisenhower's recipe was adding
about a tablespoon of nasturtium stems to the soup, the authors say.
   The book is being published this year in conjunction with the
100th anniverary of Eisenhower's birth.
   The dinner tables of presidents also prompted last year's ``The
White House Family Cookbook,'' written by Henry Haller, executive
chef at the White House for five first families, and Virginia
Aronson.
   It tells such tid-bits as what President Nixon ate for his final
White House breakfast (poached egg and hash), how the Fords
scrimped to help fight inflation (no first courses and few
desserts), and the recipe for the ``monkey bread'' the Reagans eat
at holidays.
   The Eisenhower book gives a curious reader a look at the
president's palate. For example, Eisenhower was a firm believer in
the values of red meat, and he believed that it prevented stomach
trouble.
   ``His diet called for beef every day, and when on vacation he
revealed that he might eat it 12 times a week because he loved
having little breakfast steaks,'' Russoli said. ``Steak in general
was on Ike's top 10 list.''
   The president also liked to grill 3-inch steaks by placing them
directly on white-hot coals.
   Russoli said he began researching the book in 1986 while working
on yet on another volume _ this one about Republican presidents and
their dietary habits.
   That book, called ``Grand Old Party Fare'' includes hundreds of
the favorite recipes of 17 Republican presidents and seven GOP
also-rans. That book will be completed soon, Russoli said.
   The recipes in the book vary from the basic Kansas ``Squirrel
Stew with Leftovers'' to ``Sergeant Moaney's Ontario Northland
Railway Roast Wild Goose,'' a recipe fit for White House receptions.
   And there's also the World War II favorite, ``In-a-Pinch Baked
Beans.''
   Ike's interest in cooking was a godsend to White House
reporters, the book says.
   ``Kids and pets in the White House were always good copy, but a
cooking president was sensational,'' the Russolis wrote. ``Quotes
like `I mix my batter at night and let it stand until morning'
perked up even the most blase veteran newsmen who were sure they
had heard everything before.''

   The Department of Energy's plan to reopen a
plutonium production plant as part of a nuclear cleanup program
``is like saying we need crack houses to fight drug addiction,'' an
environmental group said today.
   The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research said in a
study commissioned by the Hanford Education Action League of
Spokane, Wash., that the plant on the department's Hanford
Reservation in Eastern Washington is unsafe.
   The study also said that closing the 35-year-old plant could
save $300 million to $400 million over the next 10 years.
   Timothy Tomastik, a public affairs officer for the Energy
Department, said an environmental impact study of the plan to
restart the plant is under way.
   Tomastik said he had not seen the study, but the organization's
news release ``made it sound like we are trying to make the restart
... completely a cleanup operation, which is totally untrue. We
have never maintained that at all.''
   The plant was closed in December 1988, because of what the study
described as environmental and safety concerns.
   In a five-year environmental cleanup plan issued last week, the
department said the plant is needed to dispose of Hanford's
remaining nuclear fuel rods.
   The plant, known as PUREX, is a nuclear reprocessing facility
that extracts plutonium and uranium from the used rods for use in
nuclear weapons and research.
   Approximately 2,100 tons of highly radioactive used rods are now
stored in pools of water on the Hanford Reservation and some are
leaking radioactivity into the water, the environmental group said.
   ``Saying that plutonium production at PUREX is needed for
environmental cleanup is like saying we need crack houses to fight
drug addiction,'' said Scott Saleska, staff scientist with the
environmental group and chief author of the study.
   The organization said storing the rods under a dry inert gas
such as helium or argon might be the safest way to handle them
until a long-term disposal plan is worked out.
   Failing this, the study said, storage in capsules in water
basins ``is likely to be preferable on environmental grounds'' to
the existing plan.
   ``It is true that the existing situation with Hanford's used
nuclear fuels is a real mess _ but that is largely because DOE
ignored the situation and let the problem fester, instead of
encapsulating the leaking fuel a decade ago,'' Saleska said.
   The study recommended that funds for the PUREX operation be
canceled. It also recommended authorizing the $4 million to $5
million that Westinghouse, the principal contractor for the plant,
has estimated that it would cost to encapsulate the rods.
   In a report issued July 3, DOE said it would cost about $6
billion in each of the next five years to store and clean up waste
from nuclear weapons plants. This is nearly 50 percent more than
had been estimated earlier.

   A skydiver missed his target and landed feet
first on a passenger car, smashing the windshield but suffering
only bruises, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Ragnar Hoen told the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang he assumes his
insurance agent won't question his claim, but the deep footprints
on the hood and roof of his car may raise some eyebrows.
   Hoen was driving at 50 mph Saturday near the airport at Skien,
62 miles southwest of Oslo, when the skydiver landed feet first on
his car's hood, the newspaper said.
   ``I saw a pair of feet and somebody's rear end in my windshield
and then it went bang. I had no idea what I had hit until I stopped
and looked back at the parachutist in a ditch,'' Hoen said.
   The 20-year-old skydiver, not named in the report, suffered
bruises and told the newspaper he planned to jump again Wednesday.

   Former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. was
sentenced today to five years and 10 months in prison for mail
fraud, extortion, filing false income taxes and obstruction of
justice.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman also fined Moore $170,000.
   The three-term Republican governor had faced up to 36 years in
prison and $1.25 million in fines for crimes involving his 1984
campaign and his 1985-89 term in office.
   Hoffman sentenced Moore to concurrent terms of five years for
extortion, six months for mail fraud and two years on each on two
tax fraud counts. Moore received an additional 10 months for
obstruction of justice in blocking a federal grand jury
investigation into corruption in his administration.
   The longest-serving governor in West Virginia history was
ordered to report to a federal prison in Petersburg, Va., on July
31.
   Hoffman held a hearing before the sentencing to go over disputed
facts regarding Moore's May 8 guilty pleas, which the judge on
Monday refused to let the former governor withdraw.
   Moore, 67, claimed he was pressured by federal prosecutors who
gave him only 24 hours to consider a plea bargain. Hoffman said
Moore failed to provide new information to justify the change.
   Hoffman today also said he saw no proof for prosecutors'
contentions that Moore failed to cooperate in an ongoing two-year
investigation into public corruption.
   The U.S. attorney's office also told Hoffman that Moore failed
to accept responsibility for the crimes.
   ``He can't suck it up and say, `I did it,''' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joe Savage said. ``If there is one thing missing from that
man, it's remorse.''
   Also at issue were the sources of $100,000 Moore admitted
funneling into his 1984 campaign fund. Savage said Moore has
identified the sources for only $20,000. Moore's lawyer, William
Hundley, said the $20,000 is all Moore can recall.
   Moore, who was indicted April 12, admitted extorting $573,000
from coal operator H. Paul Kizer of Beckley in return for a $2.1
million refund from the state's Black Lung Fund, which provides
benefits to coal miners.
   Because Moore was never tried, some facts in the case came out
for the first time in court today.
   Savage said Moore took a car on a test drive from a St. Albans
dealership, never returned it and didn't pay for it.
   Hundley said Moore drove the car to the garage at the governor's
mansion and parked it there. He did not move it after that.
   After Moore lost the 1988 election to Democrat Gaston Caperton,
Tim Love, president of C&amp;O Motors, contacted Moore and said he
wanted money for the car, according to testimony from an Internal
Revenue Service agent.
   Moore asked Love how much money he wanted. Love said $10,000.
Moore replied that the car was now used and he didn't want to pay
the full price, the agent said.
   Telephone messages to Love at the dealership weren't immediately
returned today.
   Moore, a former six-term congressman who also served as governor
from 1969 to 1977, is the second West Virginia governor to be
convicted on federal charges.
   W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, a Democrat who served from 1961 to 1965,
was convicted of bribing the foreman of a jury that acquitted him
of bribery in 1968.
   Moore was acquitted in 1976 of extorting $25,000 from a
financial holding company trying to get a state bank charter.

   Pasadena Fire Marshal Bill Yearout declined to reveal how or
where Thursday's fire broke out. He said arson investigators have
several leads and don't want to release details while the

   Gilley's had been closed since March 1989 because of a legal

<HEAD>Restaurateur Says He and Barry Smoked Opium</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington restaurateur testified today that
he and Marion Barry smoked opium several times and that the two men
repeatedly snorted cocaine at the mayor's home.
   ``I was always there for Mr. Mayor,'' Hassan Mohammadi testified
at Barry's trial on drug and perjury charges.
   The Iranian-born Mohammadi said opium is a commonly used drug in
that country and that the two men smoked it by putting the drug on
the back of a spoon and warming it with the flame from a plumber's
torch.
   They inhaled through a straw and part of a coat hangar tube in
order to ``get the maximum smoke out of it,'' said Mohammadi.
   In July 1989 during a crab feast at Barry's house, Mmohammadi
testified, the mayor asked ``if I had anything.'' Mohammadi said he
did.
   The two went upstairs in Barry's home and ``we did some lines''
of cocaine ``inside the bathroom'' next to the main bedroom, said
Mohammadi. Last November, just before Thanksgiving, Mohammadi said,
Barry used cocaine in the basement of his own home, and also used
it on other occasions at his own home.
   Mohammadi said he warned Barry about going to hotels after a
public furor and criminal investigation in December 1988 of the
mayor's visits to convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis at the Ramada
Inn.
   ``You just have to slow down and you have to know who you are
dealing with,'' Mohammadi said he cautioned the mayor.
   ``He said he is not going to go to any more hotels,'' Mohammadi
said.
   ``I was a true friend for Mr. Mayor,'' Mohammadi testified at
one point. ``I was always there for Mr. Mayor.''
   Mohammadi testified that the two men boarded a pleasure boat
moored at a marina in February 1989, and Barry ``did two lines'' of
cocaine.
   On Monday, Mohammadi said he delivered cocaine to Barry in the
mayor's office, gave it to him on 30 other occasions and snorted
the drug with him several times on a 1987 trip to the Bahamas.
Mohammadi said Barry never paid for the drugs.
   Mohammadi also said he paid for the hotel stay of Barry's female
companion on the trip to the Bahamas and that the mayor helped
himself to a $3,000-to-$4,000 pile of gambling chips that Mohammadi
had purchased.
   ``How many times since you have known the defendant'' have you
furnished him with drugs? Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts
asked the witness.
   ``I would say about 30 times, maybe more,'' said Mohammadi, who
was given a grant of immunity that bars using his own testimony
against him.
   Did he ``ever force'' Barry to use the drugs? Roberts asked
Mohammadi.
   ``Not at all,'' replied the restaurant operator, who said it was
Barry who brought up the subject of cocaine.
   The mayor would ask ``are you loaded?'' said Mohammadi.
   He said he first witnessed Barry use cocaine in 1985 in an
upstairs office above Pardi's restaurant, owned by the family of
Mohammadi's wife.
   Using a rolled-up bill, Barry inhaled two lines of cocaine after
a nightclub owner put the drug out on a table, said Mohammadi.
   After one coke-snorting session at Mohammadi's apartment, Barry
carried what remained of the drug out of the bathroom, the witness
said.
   ``I said `Mayor ... don't drop it''' as Barry put the cocaine in
his breast pocket, Mohammadi testified.
   He said Barry even showed up at the restaurant in a
four-wheel-drive vehicle during a snowy day in November 1987.
   ``I can't get anything because of the snowstorm,'' Mohammadi
said he told the mayor.
   When they were in the Bahamas, Mohammadi said, they snorted
cocaine together several times and Barry inserted the drug in
marijuana cigarettes and smoked it, something Mohammadi said he
hadn't seen before.
   ``They call it M.B. specials,'' Mohammadi said the mayor told
him.
   Barry gestured to his groin and told the businessman that a
Marion Barry special ``will go right down to the bottom,''
suggesting the drug is an aphrodisiac, Mohammadi testified.
   Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, one misdemeanor count of conspiracy and three felony
counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his alleged
involvement with drugs.

   From a friendly class photo to a high-minded
declaration on world peace and prosperity, public shows of harmony
come easy to the economic summit partners. But major items on the
agenda set each apart from the others.
   That goes double for the United States this time. President Bush
stands in the minority in arguing against Western aid to the Soviet
Union, and he's greatly outnumbered in refusing to set new goals
for cutting global pollution.
   But that didn't shrink Bush's smile as he and his six summit
partners marched shoulder-to-shoulder through an extravagant
ceremony Monday.
   Harmony, after all, is a chief priority of these summits.
   After some choreographed posing for news cameras, the leaders
disappeared into a Rice University hall for two hours of formal
talks. Then it was back before the cameras, this time for the
traditional group photograph and some light-hearted banter.
   It was clear before the Houston summit began that Bush would not
be converted to the majority view on providing emergency financial
aid to Moscow. So the real challenge behind the scenes was to find
a way to move the issue down the diplomatic road, to leave it for
later when the publicity stakes were lower.
   The U.S. position on aid to Moscow illustrates how, on some
issues, each summit country has special reasons for marching to a
different drummer. Bush says the American public won't accept
giving money to Moscow until Gorbachev ends Soviet support for
Cuba, a communist nation that is a political thorn in the American
side but of relatively little concern to most of the other summit
countries.
   On the key environmental issue at the summit _ how to respond to
the threat of global warming caused by polluting industrial plants
_ Bush worries that European and Canadian ideas on cutting
pollution could damage the U.S. economy.
   Perhaps the most telling case of national interest concerns
Japan. On the one hand it is alone among the participating
countries in wanting to resume lending to China. The others in
Houston say China has not moved far enough toward democratic
reform. And yet Japan is staunchly against aiding the Soviet Union,
agreeing with Bush that it's better to wait for more democratic
reforms.
   History explains why Japan takes what appear, on the surface, to
be contradictory stances. While the Japanese have a tradition of
close business ties to China, they are still bitter that Josef
Stalin seized the Kurile islands from them after Tokyo was defeated
in World War II.
   Taizo Watanabe, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Tokyo has a unique perspective on China, and that this special
experience explains why it wants to resume lending despite the
Chinese crackdown last year on a pro-democracy movement.
   ``We know more than anyone about what is going on there,'' said
Watanabe.
   France, too, travels a lonely path on at least one summit issue.
It wants the rich Western governments to forgive more of the
foreign debt of the world's poorest nations. The U.S. position,
accepted by most of its summit partners, is to consider debt relief
only on a case-by-case basis.
   For West Germany, aid to the Soviet Union is the issue that sets
it apart from the United States and several other nations in
Houston, together with its push for more ambitious goals in cutting
global pollution.
   The Germans face a unique political challenge in trying to win
Soviet acceptance of NATO membership for a reunified German nation.
The Bonn government has decided to do this by encouraging a huge
Western aid program for Moscow, and by extending generous loans on
its own.
   As with most tough issues put on the economic summit agenda,
these problems won't be fully resolved in Houston. But, if past
practice holds, the leaders will find a way to keep their
differences from spoiling their show of unity.

   Some awards hang on the wall. Some just collect
dust. But how many people can say their award is yummy? Dr. Joe
Kramer can.
   Kramer received 1,000 pints of ice milk Tuesday from Ben &amp;
Jerry's ice cream company for his longtime community service.
   Kramer immediately turned around and invited children from his
poverty-and drug-plagued Lower East Side neighborhood to a block
party where he shared his palatable prize.
   ``I can't believe it when people come through like this,'' the
65-year-old Kramer said. ``This is going to make a lot of kids very
happy.''
   The kids feasted on reverse chocolate chunk, coffee almond fudge
and sweet cream and cookies, just a few of the Vermont-based
company's new line of reduced fat, reduced cholesterol ice milk.
   The honor, called Ben &amp; Jerry's 1,000 Pints of Light Award, was
given in conjunction with the non-profit Giraffe Project.
   The award is being given in seven major U.S. cities this summer
to people who ``stick their necks out to make the world a better
place,'' said David Hathaway of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Recipients are
nominated by their community.
   Kramer gave up a successful suburban practice 22 years ago and
set up shop in the Lower East Side.
   His office is daily filled with patients suffering from
illnesses caused by drug abuse, poverty and violence. He treats
many for free.

   A judge ruled that subway gunman Bernhard Goetz
cannot sue activist lawyer William Kunstler for libel for calling
him a ``walking timebomb'' and a racist.
   In dismissing Goetz's libel suit Monday, state Justice Beatrice
Shainswit said Kunstler's 1989 remarks were his ``overall views as
he sees the case he has brought on behalf of Mr. Cabey.''
   Darrell Cabey was one of four youths Goetz shot on a subway in
1984. Goetz, who is whiote, said the black youths were trying to
rob him. They said they were panhandling.
   Goetz was acquitted on the most serious charges but was
convicted of illegal gun possession. He served 8{-months in prison.
   Cabey was left paralyzed from the waist down by a bullet that
shattered his spine. His $500 million lawsuit against Goetz is
being handled by Kunstler.
   Goetz's suit also alleged Kunstler made libelous remarks in a
1987 poem, but the judge dismissed that charge because it was filed
after a one-year statute of limitations had expired. The poem said
Goetz shot the four without provocation.

<HEAD>Seven Cubans Seek Refuge in Czechoslovak Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Cubans, including five
opposition activists, have sought refuge in Czechoslovakia's Havana
Embassy, the state CTK news agency reported today.
   CTK's French-language service said the activists entered the
embassy to demand Czech guarantees that they could leave Cuba for a
planned weeklong visit to Czechoslovakia beginning July 15.
   The visit was to be part of a tour of Europe and the United
States ``aimed at spreading the aims and programs of the Cuban
opposition movement,'' CTK said. It did not elaborate.
   Zdenek Smrkovsky, a foreign ministry official in Prague, said
the five men walked inside the embassy through the main door on
Monday without incident. He said as far as he knew, there were no
other cases of people seeking refuge in any other embassies in
Havana.
   He said the men ``did not seek political asylum.''
   Two more Cubans, who claimed to be students, climbed over the
embassy's fence later and did ask for political asylum, CTK said.
Cuban police then cordoned off the street leading to the mission,
the news agency said.
   It identified the two as Igor Campana and Alejandro R. Lugo.
   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency quoted an unidentified
spokesperson at the Cuban Foreign Ministry as saying the five
opposition leaders ``must leave the embassy or stay there as long
as the diplomatic mission would have them.'' He was quoted before
the last two people entered the embassy.
   The activists belong to the Cuban Human Rights Committee, the
Cuban Christian Democratic Movement and other opposition groups,
CTK said.
   Cuba and Czechoslovakia were close allies before last winter's
democratic revolution swept Czechoslovakia's Communist regime from
power.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Attack Plan to Reopen Plutonium Facility</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department plan to restart a
plutonium-production plant to reprocess used nuclear fuel rods
would create unnecessary radioactive waste and increase the danger
of an explosion, an environmental group said Tuesday.
   The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, in a study
commissioned by the Hanford Education Action League of Spokane,
Wash., recommended that the plant, on the department's Hanford
Reservation in Eastern Washington, be permanently closed.
   The plant was completed in 1955 and used to extract uranium and
weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods from the N-reactor, a
nuclear power-production facility. Both plants were shut down in
1988 because of safety concerns.
   About 2,100 tons of used fuel rods are stored in two tanks. One
has leaked and been repaired but could leak again, releasing
radioactive material, the study said.
   The department has asked Congress for $34 million in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 to restart the plutonium-production plant
next year.
   Arjun Makhijani, a scientist with the environmental group and
one of the study's authors, told a news conference, ``We think
reprocessing is a dangerous technology in itself and you should not
be creating liquid waste.''
   The study said that the process would increase the risk of an
explosion in the waste tanks. Makhijani conceded that this risk
``might be small'' but said it should be guarded against because
``the consequences would be huge.'
   The department and Westinghouse Hanford Company, the principal
contractor for the plutonium plant, have denied that a resumption
of processing would increase the risk of an explosion.
   Timothy Tomastik, a public affairs officer for the department,
said an environmental impact study of the restart is under way.
   Tomastik said he had not seen the study, but, he added, the
organization's news release ``made it sound like we are trying to
make the restart ... completely a cleanup operation, which is
totally untrue.''
   The study also said leaving the plant closed could save $300
million to $400 million over the next 10 years.
   The environmental organization said a five-year environmental
cleanup plan issued by the department July 3 indicates the plant is
needed to dispose of Hanford's remaining nuclear fuel rods.
   ``Saying that plutonium production at (the plant) is needed for
environmental cleanup is like saying we need crack houses to fight
drug addiction,'' said Scott Saleska, staff scientist with the
environmental group and chief author of the study.
   The organization said storing the rods under a dry inert gas
such as helium or argon would be the safest way to handle them
until a long-term disposal plan is worked out.
   Failing this, the study said, storing the rods in capsules in
water basins ``is likely to be preferable on environmental
grounds'' to the existing plan. It recommended authorizing the $4
million to $5 million that Westinghouse has estimated it would cost
to encapsulate the rods.
   The institute said the study was financed by a grant from the
Washington State Department of Ecology.

   Jesse Jackson eulogized Mitch Snyder today for
his work on behalf of the homeless and told mourners at Snyder's
funeral, ``we will not surrender, the work continues.''
   Jackson was joined by Mayor Marion Barry and entertainers Martin
Sheen and Cher at a funeral service attended by about 1,000 people
at the shelter for the homeless founded by Snyder. Barry attended
during the noon recess of his trial at the nearby U.S. District
Courthouse on drug and perjury charges.
   Jackson urged the crowd to continue Snyder's work, saying, ``We
will not surrender, the work continues.'' The crowd responded by
chanting, ``Mitch, Mitch.''
   ``Hug someone next to you and say I love you,'' Jackson told the
mourners.
   Margaret Moore, who lives in a shelter about two miles from the
one where Snyder's funeral was held, said earlier, ``I always liked
what he did.''
   ``I didn't know anything about homeless people until I became
one _ I thought they all were bums. But I listened to him, and it
helped me to learn that the homeless are people, too.''
   Moore, who lost her apartment last month because she used rent
money for drugs, said Snyder's commitment to the downtrodden helped
her regain control over her life.
   ``He made you feel like you were somebody,'' Moore said quietly.
``I never met him, but it was clear from seeing him on TV what he
felt for the homeless _ a lot of love. Real Christian-like.''
   Snyder, 46, was found hanged last Thursday inside his room at
the shelter, an apparent suicide. A note nearby outlined
difficulties he was having in his relationship with Carol Fennelly,
his companion and co-worker for 13 years.
   ``He was a great man, perhaps a bit too selfless,'' said Ronald
Williams, a volunteer at Snyder's shelter. ``He learned how to love
everybody but himself.''
   Inside the shelter, security guard Mike Hughes remembered Snyder
as someone ``who gave everyone a chance.''
   ``You came here, and as long as you didn't get a fat head and
get lazy, you could get a chance _ Mitch was someone who gave
everyone a chance,'' said Hughes, who came to the shelter five
months ago after a drug problem cost him his job, his marriage and
his apartment.
   Now, Hughes works in the shelter's kitchen and then pulls a
shift as a security guard at night.
   ``Another thing _ Mitch would always be real friendly, ask you
how you are doing,'' Hughes continued. ``But if you used or sold
drugs, you were out. In the last few months, they've made real
headway getting rid of crackheads here.''
   Outside the shelter, Williams ushered quiet bands of mourners
from the heat into the air-conditioned shelter basement where the
viewing was held.
   ``We're expecting about 3,000,'' Williams said. ``It's going to
be a long day.''
   Snyder's death will be a blow to the homeless movement, but it
also may serve as an inspiration, Williams said.
   ``I think ... it is going to make people who have become a bit
complacent stand up,'' Williams said. ``Sometimes it takes a jolt
to make you realize that you have to do a lot yourself, and he was
the prime example of how one man can make a difference.''

<HEAD>Club Wants to Convert Former Mortuary Into Haunted House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kiwanis Club wants to lease a former
mortuary owned by the city and convert it into a haunted house for
Halloween. But one city commissioner has a response ready: boo.
   The Kiwanis Club will take its plan to the commission Wednesday.
   ``We've had enough problems over that property as it is without
making a joke out of it,'' Commissioner Cathy Anderson said. ``We
have enough skeletons in the closet in Hollywood already.''
   The Mediterranean-style home, built in 1924, was the site of the
Johnson-Foster Funeral Home for 30 years. The city paid $1.5
million earlier this year to buy it for the Art and Culture Center.
   The purchase sparked an investigation by the Broward County
State Attorney's Office, which filed a non-criminal charge against
the former city attorney of violating the state's open government
laws.
   Anderson said a widow who had her husband's funeral at Johnson
Foster told her she also found the proposal ``very distasteful.''
   Jared Anton, head of the Kiwanis Club's Halloween committee,
said the club did not intend to cause a controversy.
   Club members simply thought the 12,000-square-foot home would
offer plenty of parking and an ideal location for a haunted house,
he said.
   ``I wouldn't insult anyone by having coffins and corpses in
there,'' he said. ``It'll have moaning and witches and a cauldron
and all that.''

   Western leaders will take a step toward
resumption of World Bank loans to China, according to a draft of
the Houston economic summit's final political declaration.
   The leaders of seven major industrial nations _ six Western
democracies and Japan _ were to call for exploration of additional
international loans to promote reforms in China, the draft said.
   The World Bank has approved only $580 million in loans to China
in the past year, all linked to human need.
   At a post-midnight briefing, a Japanese government spokesman had
said Japan's prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, told other leaders at a
working dinner session that his country would gradually lend more
than $5 billion to China.
   But the draft declaration does not address that issue.
   In general, it reaffirms a position taken by the seven countries
at their 1989 meeting on holding back economic cooperation with
China but also taking into account changes that have taken place
since the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement last
year.
   The issue of resuming assistance to China dominated a working
dinner session among the leaders at the Greek-style Bayou Bend
mansion at the end of the summit's first day Monday, said Japanese
foreign ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   The seven nations participating in the summit all suspended aid
and loans to China last year after condemning the bloody
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations and the arrest of
suspected dissidents.
   ``We believe that assistance would support economic and
political reform in China,'' said Kaifu, according to the foreign
ministry.
   The Japanese loans are to be for irrigation, infrastructure and
other non-military projects that will be open to international
bidding and not necessarily built by Japanese companies, the
spokesman said.
   ``We are not doing this for the benefit of our country,'' Kaifu
was quoted as saying. The Japanese government has said it believes
the economic stability of China is essential to regional stability.
   Japanese officials have been talking about the possibility of
restoring the final third of the $15 billion loan agreement but did
not confirm that such action would be taken until the Bayou Bend
meeting.
   Watanabe said the summit leaders ``almost unanimously
recognized'' that China must not be allowed to drift into isolation.
   The spokesman declined to disclose any comments by participants
other than Kaifu.
   He said, however, that some leaders drew a comparison between
Japan's plan to restore loans to China and its refusal to give
economic assistance to the Soviet Union.
   Others, he said, viewed this as an unreasonable comparison
because there is no danger of the Soviet Union drifting into
isolation.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French Prime Minister
Francois Mitterand have been pushing for economic assistance to
Moscow.
   President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher oppose aid
to the Soviets but have not opposed bilateral action by Japan to
help China.
   Others attending the dinner session at the 29-room mansion
donated as a museum by the late philanthropist Ima Hogg included
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Italian Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti and Jacques Delors, president of the Commission of
the European Communities.
   Watanabe, who has held several sessions with reporters to
explain the Japanese position on summit issues, said progress on
human rights and political reform in China will be closely
monitored as the loans are restored.
   The Japanese made no attempt to get other summit leaders to join
in a resumption of assistance to China, he said, maintaining that
Japan's historic and geographic closeness to China give it a better
understanding of developments in the country.
   ``We are not almighty ... but we may know more about certain
aspects,'' he said.
   The Chinese have made progress in lifting curfews and releasing
political prisoners and those in China's government who support
reforms need to be encouraged, he said.
   He said the loan committed to by former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita `is not something which can be sort of thrown away.''

   A mentally retarded man whose death
sentence was thrown out by the U.S. Supreme Court was convicted a
second time in the slaying of a 22-year-old woman.
   Johnny Paul Penry, 34, was tried again because the Supreme Court
said evidence of his mental retardation should have been considered
in deciding his punishment.
   The jury's verdict was announced Monday after 2{ hours of
deliberations. Testimony in the punishment phase begins Wednesday.
   Penry has been on death row for the 1979 slaying of Pamela
Moseley Carpenter. Mrs. Carpenter was raped, beaten and stabbed in
the chest in her Livingston home on Oct. 25, 1979. She was able to
give a general description linking Penry to the attack before she
died.
   In addition, Penry gave two written confessions and made three
incriminating statements, all of which were admitted into evidence.
   Defense lawyers contended that investigators took advantage of
Penry's mental impairments _ whether they meant to or not _ to get
the confessions.
   ``I've never been satisfied he is guilty, and I'm still not,''
said defense attorney John Wright. ``But we're still alive, so
we'll fight another round'' in the punishment hearing.
   Penry has an IQ estimated at between 50 and 60 and the reasoning
capacity of a 7-year-old.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As world leaders at the seven-nation
economic debated the world's future, their spouses toured this
historic city for a glimpse of Texas' past.
   First Lady Barbara Bush led the summit wives on a 20-minute tour
of Mission San Jose, one of five old Spanish missions still
standing in San Antonio. The fort-like stone mission was built in
1720 by a Franciscan priest for teaching Christianity and European
culture to the Indians.
   Mrs. Bush's guests included France's Danielle Mitterrand,
Canada's Mila Mulroney, Italy's Livia Andreotti and Japan's Sachiyo
Kaifu.
   Britain's Denis Thatcher, the only male summit spouse, skipped
the tour.
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and
Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President Jacques Delors,
did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   After touring the mission, the women went to a private luncheon
at the home Joci and Joe Straus, Jr., longtime friends of the
Bushes, followed by a tour of the Alamo and the renovated Majestic
Theater.
   At one time, San Antonio was a contender as the economic summit
site, but it lost out to Houston, President Bush's adopted hometown.
   The Alamo is the site of the historic 1836 battle between the
Mexican army and men led by Col. William Travis who were fighting
for Texas' independence from Mexico.
   Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's troops greatly outnumbered the Alamo's
defenders, who were besieged for 14 days before the Mexicans
attacked. All 189 of Travis' men were killed.
   The incident gave birth to the battle cry, ``Remember the
Alamo!'' used by other Texans who fought for freedom.
   After visiting San Antonio, the spouses were returning to
Houston, where they planned to tour the Texas Medical Center on
Wednesday, the final day of the summit.
   On Monday, the spouses were guests of Betty and Hugh Liedtkes,
close friends of the Bushes, for a dinner in the upscale Memorial
neighborhood in Houston.
   Liedtke is a wealthy oil man who knew Bush when the president
was in the oil business in Texas before entering politics.
   The menu included quail, gazpacho soup, shrimp creole remoulade,
poached snapper and asparagus. Dessert was called Strawberries
Summit.
   Bush and Liedtke met years ago in West Texas while both were in
the oil business, and they helped form Zapata Petroleum.
Eventually, the company's investors spilt, although Liedtke and
Bush remained friends.
   Liedtke is the former chief of Houston-based Pennzoil Co., the
oil company that won an $10.3 billion judgment in 1985 from Texaco
Inc. over Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil Co. Pennzoil later settled
for $3 billion.
   Liedtke is still chairman of Pennzoil's board.

<TEXT>
   An asteroid sped past Earth at a
comparatively tiny distance of 3 million miles today, scientists
said.
   The asteroid, estimated at 300 feet to 1,000 feet in diameter,
made one of the closest crossings of Earth orbit observed in 50
years, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.
   The rocky object, dubbed 1990 MF, was located on June 26 by JPL
planetary scientist Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory.
   Helin heads the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, a
project to systematically search for asteroids crossing near Earth.
   The asteroid was 8 million miles from Earth and traveling
approximately 12,500 mph when spotted. It was then tracked last
week by Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Deep Space Network at
Goldstone, Calif.
   Initial calculations indicate the asteroid has an elongated
orbit of 161 million miles and takes two years and four months to
complete each orbit.
   Scientists continued to track it from Siding Spring, Australia;
Mount John Observatory, New Zealand; the Infrared Telescope
Facility at Mauna Kea, Hawaii; and Harvard observing station at Oak
Ridge, Mass.
   The asteroid brightened and accelerated as it approached Earth.
It was expected to surpass 22,000 mph at closest approach.
   The JPL sky survey team has found 39 near-Earth asteroids since
beginning the program in 1973.

   The school board has fired its superintendent,
citing a lack of ``mutual trust and cooperation.''
   Superintendent J. Jerome Harris emerged from the executive
session of the board Monday night and refused to comment other than
to say he had been relieved.
   School Board President D.F. Glover said Harris had been fired,
effective immediately, although he will still receive his
$112,500-a-year salary until his contract expires in 1992.
   Lester W. Butts, a special assistant to Harris and the principal
of Douglass High School, will take over as interim superintendent.
   Since he was hired Aug. 1, 1988, from the New York City system
to replace Alonzo Crim, Harris's tenure was marked by continued
controversy. Teachers complained he was harsh and arrogant, but his
run-ins with the school board were more critical.
   In December, the board gave Harris until Jan. 31 to renew his
state superintendent's certificate, which he did. He also was
criticized for failing to disclose that an assistant superintendent
had been accused of plagiarizing a doctoral dissertation.
   In March, he was questioned by the board for spending $400,000
on consulting fees during a six-month period.
   ``The board regrets the need to take this action but has
concluded a change in leadership must be made,'' Glover said in a
statement. ``The school system has not had the sense of teamwork
which is necessary to achieve and sustain progress, and there has
not been a good working relationship between the board and the
superintendent based on mutual trust and cooperation.''

   Western leaders today welcomed the political and
economic change that has swept Eastern Europe and urged Romania to
join its neighbors in adopting reforms.
   ``Europe is at the dawn of a new era,'' President Bush and
leaders of six other rich democracies said in their final political
communique.
   ``We welcome enthusiastically the profound and historic changes
sweeping the (European) continent,'' the leaders said on the second
day of their annual economic summit.
   They said they will use every opportunity to push for a united
and free Europe and expressed pleasure at the impending merger of
the two German states, which they said would offer a ``major
contribution'' to stability.
   They urged Romania, where there has been violent repression of
anti-government demonstrators, to join in the ``positive trend''
under way in neighboring countries.
   The Western nations already have promised billions of dollars in
loans, food and other assistance to Moscow's once-staunch allies in
Eastern Europe. But they are still undecided about what to do for
the Soviet Union.
   Their decision could be crucial for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, who is trying to save his embattled economic reform
program of perestroika.
   A year ago, at their summit in Paris, the leaders tapped the
European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, to find ways to
help Poland and Hungary, which were just beginning to revamp their
backward economies.
   Since then, the community has scrambled to bring together
two-dozen Western countries and drum up commitments of more than
$12 billion in a variety of aid for Poland and Hungary.
   The assistance ``is making a major contribution'' to reviving
the stricken economies of Poland and Hungary, said the community in
a report on the year-long program.
   ``It has underpinned a radical stabilization program in Poland,
which might otherwise have proved too risky, and helped both
countries to begin modernizing their economies,'' it said.
   Because of the riches promised by the program, other nations in
Eastern Europe have appealed for help.
   Last week, the foreign ministers of the Group of 24 _ the
Western nations taking part in the program _ admitted
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East Germany and Yugoslavia. Romania was
temporarily refused membership because of the recent violent
repression of anti-government demonstrators there.
   No specific sums were promised to the new members, but their
addition to the program will likely mean billions of dollars in
help.
   To gain admittance, the emerging democracies must commit
themselves to the rule of law, respect for human rights, introduce
multi-party political systems, hold free and fair elections, and
impose economic reforms.
   ``Leaders in Central and Eastern Europe who seek radical change
in their countries' political and economic systems, accept the
conditionality attaching to (Western) assistance as a spur to
reform,'' said the community's report.
   ``It is also a guarantee to their peoples that the international
community is paying close attention to the respect for political
and economic freedom in their countries,'' it said.
   In setting conditions, Western officials hope to avoid pouring
money into the economies only to have it squandered. They contend
loans granted to Poland in the 1970s were wasted because of a
poorly functioning economy. Poland now is having problems paying
back its foreign debt of about $40 billion.
   East European officials say the toughest part of their work is
changing their centrally planned economies into the free-market
models practiced in the West.
   To do that, the countries must start from scratch.
   They have to phase out government subsidies to farmers and
others, stabilize prices, strengthen their virtually worthless
currencies and allow private citizens to own property.
   They also must create banking systems and develop labor markets,
complete with social security measures.
   ``These are welcome, indeed indispensable, changes but they may
well create transitional problems,'' said the community's report.
   The Soviet Union could try to buy more goods from Western
nations, rather than its neighbors in the East, it said.
   ``A further contraction in trade among the East Europeans could
exacerbate economic difficulties just as the reform process enters
a critical phase,'' the report said.
   Such drastic changes will likely cause, at least temporarily,
higher unemployment and falling living standards.
   ``The removal of subsidies and of guaranteed lifetime employment
will test the social fabric and the libertarian values of the
peoples involved,'' the report said.
   The Western nations want their money to be used to overcome some
of these obstacles.

   Albania is negotiating with the United Nations for
Italy to evacuate by boat the thousands of Albanians who have
sought refuge in nearly a dozen embassies in Tirana, the Foreign
Ministry said today.
   Italy has begun preparations to ferry the asylum-seekers from
Albania's Adriatic port city of Durres to either Brindisi or
Otranto on the Italian coast, said a ministry spokesman.
   A representative of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar was in Tirana, the Albanian capital, negotiating the
departure procedures with the Albanian government on behalf of the
embassies where Albanians have taken refuge.
   ``We hope the operation can begin by the end of the week,'' said
the official, speaking under the ministry ground rule of anonymity.
   There are more than 5,000 Albanians in the various embassies.
About 800 are in the Italian Embassy and more than 2,000 are
believed to have taken refuge in the West German Embassy.
   The Italian government was working on contracting commercial
vessels to bring out the Albanians, the Foreign Ministry official
said, adding he expected that several trips would have to be made
to evacuate them all.
   The first 51 Albanians allowed to leave departed by plane and
landed in Czechoslovakia today. Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel
sent his official airplane to Tirana for the refugees.
   The asylum seekers began taking refuge in the embassies on June
28 in a bid to escape Europe's last Communist bastion. Some dodged
police bullets as they climbed over embassy gates.
   In a telephone interview with the Italian news agency AGI,
Italy's ambassador in Tirana, Giorgio De Andreis, said today the
embassy had completed the paperwork to obtain exit permits for the
Albanians in his embassy.
   He said the situation inside was calm because the Albanians
``finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.''
   ``Nothing is decided yet. We hope to resolve it soon.''
   He told the news agency that most of the Albanians in the
embassy consider Italy only the first leg of their emigration and
want to go on to the United States, Canada and Britain.

<HEAD>State Court Upholds Colorado's English-Only Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court has rejected a challenge
to Colorado's official English law, which Hispanic opponents call
insulting and discriminatory.
   The challenge to the 1988 ballot initiative did not address the
official English issue directly, but questioned the way election
laws are applied.
   ``The proponents of English only were shown repeatedly to have
racial motives involved in their movement,'' said attorney Kenneth
Padilla, who represented plaintiff Rita Montero. ``They had an
election which should never have been held.''
   Montero, a member of the National Coalition Against English
Only, alleged that Secretary of State Natalie Meyer improperly
allowed backers of official English to collect new petition
signatures after failing to present enough valid ones by deadline.
But Meyer barred opponents from challenging the new signatures,
saying the challenge wasn't timely, the lawsuit said.
   The high court on Monday ruled 6-3 that state regulations
affecting voter initiatives should be read liberally, to prevent
thwarting the public's right to create laws.
   The law, which was approved by 64 percent of voters, amended the
Colorado constitution to declare English the state's official
language. Sixteen other states have similar laws.
   Proponents of the law said their main goal was to force the
government to use English, but the governor of Colorado and mayor
of Denver issued executive orders allowing the government to
provide official information, such as voting regulations, in
English and Spanish.
   The law has been blamed for some instances of discrimination
against Hispanics and Asian immigrants in Colorado, including one
where a public school bus driver ordered students to stop speaking
Spanish on the bus.
   Montero said she was unsure whether the coalition would continue
to challenge the law.
   State Rep. Barbara Philips, who sponsored the initiative, was
unavailable for comment.
   But Philips' lawyer, Shannon Robinson, said the ruling defends
people's access to the ballot.
   ``They're not saying it's unconstitutional. Nothing about the
amendment itself warrants reversal,'' she said. ``We feel the
election laws were properly qualified by the secretary of state and
they (opponents) had their day in court.''

<HEAD>Baker Meeting With Foreign Minister Postponed For Health Reasons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's push for Mideast
negotiations was delayed Tuesday as Israel sent word its foreign
minister was not well enough to meet next week in Paris with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The foreign minister, David Levy, is recovering at home from
surgery for a circulatory ailment. Levy's physicians concluded
after Baker proposed the meeting that his health would not permit
him to travel to France, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret
D. Tutwiler, said.
   Baker, attending an economic summit meeting here, called again
for Israeli negotiations with Palestinian Arabs. He said all seven
democracies assembled here had concluded such talks offered the
``greatest potential'' for a Mideast settlement.
   U.S. efforts to promote negotiations went into a tailspin in
March with the collapse of the Israeli government over Baker's
formula for the negotiations. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
objected to Arab-sponsored provisions to include Palestinians
deported from the West Bank and others with homes in East Jerusalem.
   The Israeli leader viewed the provisions as a challenge to his
nation's retention of the entire city of Jerusalem as its capital
and advancing Arab demands to recover the West Bank.
   But now that Israel has formed a new government the Bush
administration is eager to try again. Baker has met in Washington
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and wrote Levy
last Thursday proposing the Paris meeting.
   Baker already had plans to go to the French capital for sessions
on Germany and a talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   His letter to Levy complimented the foreign minister as a
``problem-solver'' while describing himself as one, as well,
diplomatic sources said. At the same time, Baker restated the
provisions that Israel had opposed.
   Spokswoman Tutwiler stressed Levy's health was the only reason
for not holding the meeting. She said Baker would try to reschedule
it later.

   Here is a look at the accomplishments of the 28th
Communist Party congress after eight days, as well as what remains
to be done:
   
   ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev was re-elected as party leader Tuesday in a
one-sided race against Siberian strike leader Teimuraz Avaliani
after seven others who were nominated backed out.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev won a critical power struggle Monday for a virtually
new Communist Party Politburo, with delegates voting to require the
body to include the general secretary, his deputy and the first
secretaries of the 15 Soviet republics.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev rebuffed attempts Sunday by delegates to evaluate each
member of the Politburo, getting them to agree instead to pass
judgment on the entire Central Committee and the Politburo as a
whole.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, warned party
traditionalists Friday that if they didn't reform, they will end up
like Communists in Eastern Europe: facing prosecution for ruining
society.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Regional party leaders on July 4 accused Gorbachev's leadership
of cowardice and indecision, but the speakers themselves displayed
no new ideas and no alternative to re-electing him party leader.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Kremlin hard-liners, led by conservative Politburo member Yegor
K. Ligachev, on July 3 launched fierce attacks on Gorbachev's
reforms in the economy, politics, the military and foreign policy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On the first day, July 2, Gorbachev attacked bureaucrats for
hindering his reforms. He admitted that the leadership made
mistakes during his tenure but also blamed the ``heavy legacy'' of
previous leaders.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE:
   _ Elect a new Central Committee, which in turn will choose a new
Politburo.
   _ Elect a deputy general secretary, a new post that some
delegates said would be filled by a Gorbachev protege.
   _ Adopt a platform for the Communist Party.

<HEAD>Gore Says Two Leaking Fixtures Were Installed Despite Failing
Testing</HEAD>

   Two plumbing fixtures were installed on the
space shuttles despite failing initial tests for leaks, Sen. Al
Gore, D-Tenn., said today. They were among seven such fixtures that
did not pass tests, he said.
   Gore said the hydrogen plumbing fixtures, called umbilicals,
were tested with liquid nitrogen using a simulated spacecraft part
on one side. When the units failed the test they were retested in
another way, he said.
   NASA spaceflight Director William Lenoir denied that the parts
failed the test. He said retesting in a different manner was a
normal part of the procedure.
   Lenoir said the umbilicals were first tested against what isunit which
simulates where the umbilicals would 
called a slave be
attached to the space shuttle orbiter.
   ``The slave unit is not flight hardware, therefore it is more
likely to be the source of a leak than is the flight hardware,''
said Lenoir.
   He denied that the test was redesigned in order to assure that
the umbilicals would pass.
   When leaks were detected in the first test, Lenoir said, the
slave unit was removed and a blank plate was substituted. This was
done, he said, because it was assumed the leak was from the rnings were
$2,000, or $30 an hour, after expenses.
   That compares to the $7 an hour from the legitimate jobs that 75
percent of the probationers reported holding.
   ``We came to this study from an employment perspective,'' said
Karen Hastie Williams, chairwoman of the Committee on Strategies to
Reduce Chronic Poverty, one of the groups that commissioned the
study.
   ``We hoped to identify employment and training strategies to
convince drug dealers to end their involvement in the underground
economy and join the legitimate work force.''
   But, conceded economist Peter Reuter, ``Even creation of
considerably higher paying legitimate jobs probably wouldn't get us
very far. Dealers would still have smaller total incomes than they
can earn now by supplementing their regular wages with drug
selling. Also, many of them have expensive drug habits.''
   Reuter, the report's principal author, said in an interview
that, while most street-level sales were by blacks, the
availability of drugs in Washington affects not just the city's
predominantly black population.
   ``Our figures show that there are 79,000 cocaine addicts in the
Washington metropolitan area and over 78 percent of them live in
suburban areas,'' he said. ``Therefore, a lot of people who are
involved in drug transactions may not be black, but are suburban
whites who come into the city to make purchases and who take the
drugs back to their communities for sale or use.''
   While a typical city street dealer's earnings aren't enough to
finance flashy cars and lavish lifestyles, it is the image of such
luxuries that draw many young men into selling drugs, Reuter said
in an interview.
   ``People such as Rayful Edmond III (a convicted city cocaine
kingpin) send the wrong messages to many people who are considering
getting involved in selling drugs. They see that people like
Edmond, who was able to create a large illegal drug organization,
living what they believe to be a high lifestyle _ but they never
see the downside, the consequences that can result from such
activity.''
   Edmond, on trial on a murder charge, has already been sentenced
to life in prison without parole on a string of drug convictions.
   The study found that dealers active at least two days a week
face a 22 percent chance of going to prison, a 7 percent chance of
severe injury and a 1.4 percent chance of being killed _ a fatality
rate 100 times that of the general work force.
   Given those risks, the report said, ``long periods of steady
earnings are unlikely to be common.''
   Looking at black men born in 1967, the study found that up to
one in six had been charged with selling drugs by the time he
turned 20. For the future, the researchers said, ``the ratio is
likely to be closer to one in three before that age group reaches
30.''
   The study held out some hope among the youngest group surveyed _
the 387 ninth and tenth graders. While one in six was selling
drugs, only about 11 percent were using them.
   ``That could mean that anti-drug messages may be getting through
to the younger population in the city,'' Reuter said, adding,
however, ``The downside is that many juvenile sellers are involved
in other delinquency-related offenses.''

   Here is a text of the statement on transnational
issues given Tuesday at the 1990 economic summit of industrialized
nations:
   Terrorism&equals;
   We, the heads of state or government, reaffirm our condemnation
of terrorism in all its forms, our commitment to make no
concessions to terrorists or their sponsors, and our resolve to
continue to cooperate in efforts to combat terrorism. We demand
that those governments which provide support to terrorists end such
support immediately. We are determined not to allow terrorists to
remain unpunished, but to see them brought to justice in accordance
with international law and national legislation.
   We welcome the recent release of several hostages, but remain
deeply concerned that hostages are still being held, some for more
than five years. Their ordeal and that of their families must end.
We call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all
hostages and for an accounting of all persons taken hostage who may
have died while being held. We call on those with influence over
hostage-takers to use their influence to this end.
   We note with deep concern the continuing threat presented to
civil aviation by terrorist groups, as demonstrated by such
outrages as the sabotage of civil aircraft over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, above Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, and over
Colombia on Nov. 27, 1989. We reiterate our determination to fight
terrorist assaults against civil aviation.
   Accordingly, we will continue our cooperation to negotiate a
convention requiring the introduction of additives into plastic
explosives to aid in their detection. We pledge to work to
strengthen international civil aviation security standards.
Consistent with this objective, we note the importance of making
available training and technical assistance to other nations. We
support initiatives undertaken through the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) regarding this issue. We will work
together with ICAO to expand such assistance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Non-proliferation&equals;
   We discussed the threat to international security posed by the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and of
ballistic missile weapons delivery systems.
   With regard to nuclear proliferation, we take special note of
the recent declaration issued by the European Council in Dublin on
that subject. That document underscored the great importance
attached to the maintenance of an effective international nuclear
non-proliferation regime and the need to make every effort to
contribute to strengthening non-proliferation and encouraging the
participation of further countries in the regime. The Treaty on
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is an important element
of that regime. We further endorse the EC's call for all states to
apply IAEA safeguards on as universal a basis as possible.
   We also urge all nuclear suppliers to adopt nuclear export
control measures equivalent to the Nuclear Suppliers Group
Guidelines.
   Whether NPT parties or not, we commit ourselves to working
actively to secure a satisfactory outcome to nuclear
non-proliferation discussions in the forthcoming months, including
those at the Fourth Review Conference of the NPT.
   We hope that these discussions will contribute to the
achievement of as broad a consensus as possible in favor of an
equitable and stable non-proliferation regime. Such a regime should
be based on an indispensable balance between the non-proliferation
of arms and the development of peaceful and safe uses of nuclear
energy.
   The global community has focused for decades on nuclear
proliferation, especially when combined with advanced missile
delivery systems. Today we also face new and growing problems from
the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons.
   With regard to chemical and biological proliferation, we commit
ourselves to pursue efforts to prevent the diversion of chemical
precursors at a national level, as well as in the relevant Western
fora. We similarly commit ourselves to be vigilant about the danger
of potential diversions in the field of biological technologies.
   We endorse a complete ban on chemical weapons, through an
effective and verifiable treaty, as the only long-term guarantee
against the proliferation of chemical weapons. We believe an
important step toward achieving such a treaty was made in the
recent U.S.-Soviet agreement on destruction and non-production of
chemical weapons and the recent declaration of intent by NATO
states to become original signatories to the Chemical Weapons
Convention. We reiterate our determination, first expressed at the
1989 Paris Conference on Chemical Weapons, to redouble the effort
at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to resolve the remaining
issues and to conclude the Convention at the earliest date. We also
urge all states to become parties as soon as it is concluded.
Similarly, as the 1991 Review Conference on the Biological Weapons
Convention approaches, we call on all nations that have not become
party to the Convention to do so and to participate in
confidence-building measures designed to strengthen its
effectiveness.
   We wish to highlight the importance of dealing with the related
threat of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons. We note especially the
contribution of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to our
joint efforts to control missile proliferation. We applaud the
recent decisions of additional nations to adhere to the MTCR, and
we call upon all nations to observe the MTCR Guidelines.

<HEAD>Pageant Officials Upset Because Miss Washington Lives in Oregon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The flaw with Miss Washington 1990 lies not in
her intelligence, talent or beauty. It's in her hometown _ which
happens to be in Oregon.
   Local contest officials in Washington contend that Lynnae Marie
Thurik should be declared ineligible because she didn't spend
enought time in the state.
   Contestants have been known before to hop states in the pageants
that lead to Miss America. This year's rules for the national
pageant require contestants to either have lived in the state for
six months, be attending school there or work there a minimum of
half of a full work week.
   Thurik, who is busy working out, studying and giving mock
interviews in preparation for the Miss America pageant on Sept. 8,
said she was clearly eligible for the contest.
   ``I wouldn't have been on the stage if I wasn't qualified,'' she
said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Vancouver, Wash., just
across the Columbia River from the her home in Lake Oswego, a
Portland suburb.
   Thurik, 26, sells advertising for Oregon-based This Week
magazine, and her territory includes Clark County, Wash.
   Patti Belik, president of the Washington State Association of
Local Scholarship Pageants, said Monday that her group asked
national pageant officials to examine Thurik's sales logs to see
how much time she actually spent in Washington.
   ``Going back two years in issues, there is very, very little in
This Week from Clark County,'' Belik said.
   Phyllis Goldhammer, head of the Miss Washington Scholarship
Pageant, said Thurik qualified for Miss Clark County by employment
and her enrollment in photography and fitness courses at Clark
College, a two-year school in Washington.
   Miss America officials in New Jersey would not confirm that they
had received the association's letter, and referred all questions
to the Miss Washington office.
   Thurik, who graduated in 1986 with a degree in fine arts from
Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, said she has entered 14
pageants and has competed for Miss Oregon three times, finishing as
second runner-up last year.
   She said winning Miss America has been her dream since age 5.
   ``Ever since I was a child I looked up to her and molded my life
after her. I would not even steal a cookie from the cookie jar
because I told myself Miss America would not do that,'' she said.
   Last year's Miss America winner, Debbye Turner, won the Miss
Missouri pageant, but her home was actually in Jonesboro, Ark.,
said Larry Webber, chairman of the board of the Missouri contest.
He said Turner qualified as a full-time student at the University
of Missouri-Columbia.
   ``It's not uncommon at all,'' he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev handily won re-election
Tuesday as Soviet Communist Party leader from a congress that
assailed him for eight days but concluded the party could not
survive without him.
   Although opposition appeared to melt away as the delegates
considered electing a new general secretary, a sizable
anti-Gorbachev sentiment was evident in the balloting.
   Delegates at the 28th congress of the Soviet Communist Party
voted 3,411 to 1,116 to keep Gorbachev as general secretary. His
opponent, Teimuraz Avaliani, a Siberian party leader, received 501
votes to 4,026.
   Under congress' rules, delegates are required to take a separate
vote on each candidate. It was the first time a general secretary
was elected by a congress and not a plenary meeting of the Central
Committee.
   Gorbachev nodded silently at the results, but did not smile as
the delegates responded to his victory with loud applause.
   In a brief acceptance speech, the 59-year-old president and
party leader expressed ``gratitude for enormous support and trust''
the congress had placed in him. ``I thank you for this,'' he said.
   He said he would take into account the criticism leveled against
him and would take ``the most serious, far-reaching conclusions''
from it.
   He then adopted a serious tone of voice and said: ``You elected
me after hearing my positions. I take my election as support for my
positions.''
   Many had expected the congress could pose a challenge to
Gorbachev. But delegates approved Gorbachev's proposal to
reorganize and expand the party Politburo, transferring greater
power to the government that Gorbachev heads.
   The top party job carries no fixed term of office. But the
meeting changed party rules to require that the general secretary
be elected by a congress, which traditionally meets every four or
five years, rather than by the Central Committee, which meets
several times a year. The change will make it harder for opponents
to oust Gorbachev as party leader, a post he has held since 1985.
   In March, Gorbachev was elected to a five-year term as president
with authority newly strengthened at his initiative.
   Gorbachev was nominated as general secretary in a secret vote at
the Grand Kremlin Palace, a short walk from the hall where the
congress is being held.
   He received warm applause as he stepped up to the congress
podium to accept the nomination.
   ``I carry the most responsibility for what has been done,'' he
told the delegates, accepting the nomination. ``You have the
possibility, you have a lot of information, it's right that you
should decide.''
   Gorbachev and seven others were nominated for the top Communist
Party post.
   Amnog those nominated from the floor of the congress for the
party leader's post were Interior Minister Vadim A. Bakatin,
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Gorbachev adviser
Alexander N. Yakovlev. All withdrew their names except for
Gorbachev and Avaliani, party leader in the Siberian city of
Kiselyovsk.
   ``I do not see a stronger, more experienced'' candidate than
Gorbachev, Shevardnadze said.
   Vladimir Kalyuta, a worker from the coal-mining region of
Kemerovo, nominated Gorbachev on behalf of the congress' Council of
Representatives, a committee made up of delegates from major
geographical regions.
   Avaliani, 58, was also head of a strike committee in a labor
protest for higher pay and better working conditions in the
Kuznetsk Coal Basin last summer.
   The nomination of the stocky, white-haired Avaliani came on the
eve of a one-day miners strike protesting the government's
inability to fulfill promises it made to end last year's strike.
Miners are demanding the government resign.
   In his address, Avaliani said he favored continued government
control of key enterprises and supports strikes only on a
case-by-case basis.
   Although nominations were open to the floor, conservatives did
not nominate Politburo hard-liner and key Gorbachev critic, Yegor
K. Ligachev.
   ``The congress did not nominate him. That says it all,'' said
Moscow party boss Yuri Prokofiev. Asked if he thought Ligachev's
political career was over, Prokofiev replied: ``Yes, I think so.''
   Prokofiev told reporters that Vladimir Ivashko, president of the
Ukraine, the Soviet Union's second-largest republic and a key
agricultural and energy-producing region, was the favorite for the
new post of Gorbachev's deputy.
   Selection of Ivashko could be a bid to quiet separatist trends
in the Ukraine.
   At the opening of Tuesday's session, Gorbachev lashed out at his
conservative critics.
   ``You can never go back to yesterday by any path, and no
dictatorship ... solves anything,'' he said, jabbing his hands in
the air for emphasis.
   ``If any of the delegates came to the congress with the hope of
returning the party to old conditions, comfortable or
uncomfortable, this is not a question,'' he said. ``They were
seriously mistaken.''
   More than 40 percent of the 4,700 delegates to the congress are
officials in the party apparatus.

<TEXT>
   A television reporter told a judge the name
of a confidential source today and was immediately freed from the
jail where he had served two weeks of a six-month contempt of court
sentence.
   ``I want to see my wife and my son and have a pizza and beer,''
said KMOL reporter Brian Karem, moments after he was freed by State
District Judge Pat Priest.
   Karem was jailed June 27 for refusing to say who arranged a
telephone interview with jailed capital murder suspect Henry
Hernandez. Hernandez and his brother, Julian, are charged in the
March 1989 shooting death of a San Antonio police officer, Gary
Williams.
   Karem today identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a cousin
of the Hernandez brothers.
   He said he decided to reveal the name after Ms. Ledesma, who now
lives in California, agreed to relieve him of his promise to
protect her identity.
   During today's hearing, Priest asked Karem about the extent of
Ms. Ledesma's involvement. When told she had simply arranged the
interview, Priest said, ``I don't understand then, what would be
the need for anonymity on her part. ... She never had anything to
do with the statements that you ran on the air, is that correct?''
   Karem replied, ``Yes.'' Then Priest said, ``He is released.''
   Karem's attorney, Larry Macon, said he and other lawyers
obtained a telephone deposition Monday night from Ms. Ledesma, who
has been living in Santa Clara, Calif., since May 1989.
   In the deposition, the woman confirmed that she helped arrange a
three-way telephone conversation that also involved Karem and Henry
Hernandez, Macon said.
   Attorneys in the murder trial of the Hernandez brothers have
said they need to know who arranged the interview to assure a fair
trial and determine whether the interview should be admitted as
evidence.
   Henry Hernandez said in the interview that he shot the officer
in self-defense.
   In a telephone interview carried live by KMOL Monday night,
Karem indicated he would be out of jail soon, and contended that
the defense has known for some time who the source was.
   ``I'm kind of upset that it took 13 months for the district
attorney and the defense to do their job. They've been playing a
game,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, the Supreme Court voted 7-2 to reject Karem's
emergency request that he be freed pending his appeal of the
judge's contempt order that led to his jailing.

   A debate on energy fizzled in the Bihar
state legislature when the lights went out in the house, according
to news reports Tuesday.
   The Times of India said debate on budget allocations for the
state Energy Ministry was postponed because of the 110-minute
electrical failure in Patna, about 550 miles east of New Delhi.
   The legislature's chairman, Umeshwar Prasad Verma, adjourned the
320-member house for the day Monday because of the ``near
darkness,'' it said.
   Power failures are common in India, but emergency power normally
is supplied to state legislatures and ministers' homes. It was not
immediately known why emergency line in Patna did not work.

   A 95-year-old man who is believed to be the
oldest murder defendant in city history is back in the apartment
building where he allegedly bludgeoned a neighbor to death.
   The slaying of 88-year-old Norma Marks has tenants at the
building on Manhattan's Upper West Side demanding the immediate
jailing of Oliver Barre. He was arrested after being found covered
with blood on the floor of the dead woman's apartment on June 16,
authorities said.
   Barre told police he beat Mrs. Marks to death with a metal pipe
in self-defense. He was released without bail by two judges over
the protests of residents and the prosecution.
   ``I was quite concerned to have a person in that condition
walking around the building,'' said Cyla Guerwicz, a 23-year
resident. ``He could snap at any moment. It's a reasonable
concern.''
   More than 140 residents signed a petition demanding Barre go to
jail pending his trial. The petition said they ``feared for their
collective safety and well-being.''
   Barre, a Navy officer during World War I, was released on his
own recognizance by Criminal Court Judge Laura Drager, who also
turned down prosecution requests that he be held for psychiatric
tests.
   Another judge ordered Barre to hire a round-the-clock home
attendant to keep an eye on him.
   Barre told a police officer who responded to the slaying that
Mrs. Marks was a murderer who had poisoned 15 to 20 people in the
building, court documents indicated.
   Barre, who had minor scratches, claimed Mrs. Marks had tried to
strangle him and she was killed in self-defense, the document said.
Mrs. Marks was struck repeatedly with a metal pipe, suffering a
fractured skull, jaw and ribs along with massive cuts and bruises.
   Two officials of the prosecutors office dismissed Barre's
defense, as well as a published report that the killing was
prompted by a love triangle involving a third woman, age 86. The
officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is
before a grand jury.
   The Manhattan district attorney's office says it knows of no one
older than Barre ever charged with murder in the city.
   Assistant District Attorney Bridget Brennan told acting state
Supreme Court Justice George Roberts on Tuesday that the grand jury
could decide on an indictment by the end of the week.
   Barre, who appears solidly built, attended the brief court
session in a wheelchair. Wearing a baseball cap that read ``U.S.
Submarine Veterans,'' he sat silently as Brennan addressed the
judge.
   Defense attorney John B.B. Lewis, assisted by a nurse, pushed
his client out of the courtroom and into an elevator without
commenting on the case. The attorney also did not return a phone
call to his office.

<HEAD>Houston's Power Set Relegated to B-Team Seats at Summit Dinner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the dinner party of the year, the hottest
ticket in town, but Houston's power set found itself playing social
second-fiddle at Tuesday night's official summit dinner.
   The local moneyed set were relegated to the wings until after
the hickory-grilled veal medallions were served on Tiffany-designed
china to President Bush, his fellow summiteers and top government
officials, including Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Most of Houston society, which griped early on about too much
business and too few parties at the economic summit, was simply
left out.
   Bush, who calls Houston his home town, invited about 80 power
brokers, contributors and friends to the Fine Arts Museum for
after-dinner entertainment and a chance to mingle with the mighty.
   Quick social diplomacy by Bush kept feathers from getting too
ruffled over the lack of a meal.
   ``The president sent word early this was to be a substantive
meeting, a serious meeting,'' retired bank president Ben Love, said
of the dinner.
   ``I have not heard anyone in Houston question to what degree we
are to participate in anything. That is the call of the
president,'' said Love, a major contributor to Houston's host
committee.
   Those lucky enough to even make the B-list were mostly
Republican heavyweights and business tycoons. Socialites weren't
invited.
   ``It was ridiculous for them to think they'd be invited,'' said
Houston Chronicle society columnist Maxine Messenger. ``This is a
three-day business meeting, not a social playground.''
   Mexican restaurant maven Ninfa Laurenzo, a Bush friend, said she
planned to wear a conservative black silk suit to the after-dinner
entertainment because ``It's not a sparkling-type evening. It's
sparkling in its own way.''
   And as far as missing out on the meal?
   ``We have plenty of tacos, thank God,'' she said. ``I think its
just an honor to be in the same room with all these world leaders.''
   County Judge Jon Lindsay was one of only 14 Houstonians to make
the A-list for dinner because he's both the elected head of Harris
County government, and a Bush friend.
   ``Other than being a member of the exclusive group (of Western
leaders) itself, this is the next best thing,'' he said.
   Lindsay said his wife planned to wear the same dress she wore to
a dinner last Friday. ``No one knows her at this dinner, so no
one's seen the dress before,'' he said.
   ``We are excited, needless to say,'' Lindsay said. ``This is a
great event for a little ol' guy like me.''

<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega's longtime personal banker and
five co-defendants formed a ``partnership in crime'' to launder $32
million in drug profits through worldwide financial transactions, a
prosecutor said Tuesday.
   The defendants _ five Bank of Credit and Commerce International
employees plus a Colombian airplane broker _ knew the huge sums of
cash they were trying to disguise were proceeds of cocaine sales
but didn't care, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Jackowski said in
closing arguments.
   In fact, they even offered helpful laundering hints to an
undercover agent to skirt ``Ladea'' _ which stood for the Drug
Enforcement Administration, he said.
   ``From the evidence there should be no doubt in anyone's mind
the funds that were picked up on the streets of this country were
from the sale of cocaine,'' Jackowski told the jury in summing up
the government's case in the six-month trial.
   A U.S. Customs agent posing as a well-connected, high-stakes
launderer during a two-year sting told the bankers his clients were
dope dealers who ``don't like mistakes,'' Jackowski said.
   Drugs smuggled into the United States were sold on the streets
and the cash was converted into certificates of deposit that first
were used as collateral for loans, then to pay them off as they
matured, the government maintained.
   The drug profits, hidden through these elaborate transactions
involving BCCI subsidaries in Panama, Luxembourg, France and
Switzerland, eventually were to wind up back in the hands of drug
dealers to finance the next haul, according to prosecutors.
   ``What the government must prove is that the defendants acted in
bad faith ... and that they didn't do so by some kind of mistakes
or accident,'' the prosecutor told jurors. ``What it really is is a
partnership in crime,''
   Charged with conspiring to launder drug profits for the Medellin
cartel and with various laundering counts are five officers of the
Luxembourg-based BCCI, including Amjad Awan, banker for deposed
Panamanian leader Noriega.
   On trial with Awan, who was Miami-based assistant director of
BCCI's Latin American division, are Askbar A. Bilgrami, a director
of BCCI's Latin American Division; Syed Aftab Hussain, BCCI's
operations officer of the bank in Panama; Sibte Hassan, an officer
in the Paris branch; Ian Howard, French country manager based in
Paris; and Rudolf Armbrect of Medellin, Colombia.
   The bankers claim they never intentionally violated the law and
were entrapped by the undercover agent.
   The six defendants face a possible penalty of five years on the
conspiracy count plus 20 years on each of the 30 laundering
charges. All are charged with conspiracy and various combinations
of laundering.

   A typical young, poorly educated black man
selling drugs on the streets of the nation's capital can count on
earning $2,000 a month _ tax free, the Rand Corporation said
Tuesday.
   Not enough for a ``Mercedes or great fortunes,'' but more than
four times as much an hour as drug dealers can expect to make from
legitimate jobs.
   Researchers based their conclusions on information supplied by
the city government about the 24,000 people arrested for selling or
possessing drugs from 1985 through 1987; interviews with 186 men
aged 18 to 40 who said they had been involved with drugs and were
on probation during that time; and a survey of 387 boys aged 15 to
18.
   The report estimated that, in 1987 alone, an estimated 24,000
city residents were selling drugs on the street. For the three in
eight who were dealing daily, the median monthly earnings were
$2,000, or $30 an hour, after expenses.
   That compares to the $7 an hour from the legitimate jobs that 75
percent of the probationers reported holding.
   The study found that dealers active at least two days a week
face a 22 percent chance of going to prison, a 7 percent chance of
severe injury and a 1.4 percent chance of being killed _ a fatality
rate 100 times that of the general work force.
   Given those risks, ``long periods of steady earnings are
unlikely to be common,'' the report said.
   ``We came to this study from an employment perspective,'' said
Karen Hastie Williams, chairwoman of the Committee on Strategies to
Reduce Chronic Poverty, one of the groups that commissioned the
study.
   ``We hoped to identify employment and training strategies to
convince drug dealers to end their involvement in the underground
economy and join the legitimate work force.''
   But, conceded economist Peter Reuter, ``Even creation of
considerably higher paying legitimate jobs probably wouldn't get us
very far. Dealers would still have smaller total incomes than they
can earn now by supplementing their regular wages with drug
selling. Also, many of them have expensive drug habits.''
   The estimated median income of street-level drug dealers was
higher than the average $12,898 retail-trade workers made in
1987-88, according to the city government.
   Construction workers made $24,879, on average, while
service-industry workers made $26,545. The average annual salary
for all private-sector workers was $25,857, while government
employees made $32,118.
   Reuter, the report's principal author, said in an interview
that, while most street-level sales were by blacks, the
availability of drugs in Washington affects not just the city's
predominantly black population.
   ``Our figures show that there are 79,000 cocaine addicts in the
Washington metropolitan area and over 78 percent of them live in
suburban areas,'' he said. ``Therefore, a lot of people who are
involved in drug transactions may not be black, but are suburban
whites who come into the city to make purchases and who take the
drugs back to their communities for sale or use.''
   While a typical city street dealer's earnings aren't enough to
finance flashy cars and lavish lifestyles, it is the image of such
luxuries that draw many young men into selling drugs, Reuter said
in an interview.
   ``People such as Rayful Edmond III (a convicted city cocaine
kingpin) send the wrong messages to many people who are considering
getting involved in selling drugs. They see that people like
Edmond, who was able to create a large illegal drug organization,
living what they believe to be a hig lifestyle _ but they never see
the downside, the consequences that can result from such activity.''
   Edmond, on trial on a murder charge, has already been sentenced
to life in prison without parole on a string of drug convictions.
   Looking at black men born in 1967, the study found that up to
one in six had been charged with selling drugs by the time he
turned 20. For the future, the researchers said, ``the ratio is
likely to be closer to one in three before that age group reaches
30.''
   The study held out some hope among the youngest group surveyed _
the 387 ninth and tenth graders. While one in six was selling
drugs, only about 11 percent were using them.
   ``That could mean that anti-drug messages may be getting through
to the younger population in the city,'' Reuter said, adding,
however, ``The downside is that many juvenile sellers are involved
in other delinquency-related offenses.''

   Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor
said Tuesday his forces will refuse to observe a cease-fire and
predicted he would capture the city of Monrovia by the end of the
week.
   Taylor, speaking in a telephone interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp., was responding to published reports that he had
accepted a cease-fire and the rebels' march on the capital was
suspended.
   ``There will be no cease-fire,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor, whose men appear to have made little progress since
reaching the outskirts of Monrovia a week ago, said his National
Patriotic Front is ``progressing carefully because of the massive
loss of life.''
   ``We are only proceeding with caution while we evacuate people
into safety zones ... to receive food and medical treatment,'' he
said. ``This is why we have not stormed the capital as we should.''
   He conceded the final assault was taking a long time, saying:
``I understand that and I regret the long time. But if we were to
move in and tear that city apart the whole world would be jumping
all over us.''
   He added: ``My troops are exchanging fire right now in Monrovia.
... I think that Monrovia should be down by the weekend.''
   The French news agency Agence France Presse, which has a
reporter with the rebels, reported Tuesday that the insurgents were
executing members of President Samuel Doe's Krahn tribe and members
of the Mandingo people, accused of supporting Doe.
   A pool report filed by correspondents in the besieged Liberian
capital said government troops continued to kill suspected rebel
supporters. A 19-year-old man was bundled into a car and taken to a
beach where soldiers slit his throat, the report said.
   The six-month conflict, which began with Taylor's invasion from
Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, has become a tribal war. Doe's forces were
accused of killing hundreds of civilians from the Gio and Mano
tribes, the main rebel support base. The rebels have accused Doe's
administration of being corrupt.
   Taylor said the rebels were sending a delegation to peace talks
in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to hear what mediators from the Economic
Community of West African States are proposing.
   The talks were scheduled to open Tuesday, but the rebel
delegation failed to arrive, probably because of transport problems.
   The economic community group reportedly has proposed
introduction of a multinational, African peacekeeping force in
Liberia to oversee new elections. Taylor has opposed that.
   ``There will be no foreign soldiers landing on one inch of
Liberian soil,'' Taylor said. He said some members of the economic
community mediation team were supporting Doe, and had sent him
weapons.
   Doe, meanwhile, reportedly has agreed to resign, but only after
a stable, interim government is set up.
   Liberian Information Minister Emmanuel Bowier, in Freetown for
the mediation talks, said Doe had no intention of being driven out
of Monrovia by the rebels, but would step down in favor of a
national unity government. The government would have to include all
sides in the conflict, Bowier said.
   The plan reportedly also rules out Taylor heading the
transitional government. The rebel said, ``There will be no interim
government that is not headed by Charles Taylor.''
   The rebels have refused to accept a cease-fire until Doe resigns
and leaves the West African nation.

   State water officials are searching
for the cause of a fish kill in a river behind an Arco Chemical Co.
plant where 17 workers died last week in an explosion and fire.
   Although an exact count had not been completed, Texas Water
Commission spokesman Bill Colbert said, ``Quite a few fish were
noticed drifting in the water or along the shore near Bear Lake, an
inlet of that river.''
   Colbert said Monday the commission was awaiting test results of
water samples from the San Jacinto River to determine the cause of
the fish kill.
   But preliminary tests pointed to a combination of factors,
including a sudden change in water temperatures and the possibility
of caustic substances such as firefighting foam in the water.
   First reports of the kill came several hours after a fire and
explosion late Thursday decimated an area the size of a city block
at the plant, Colbert said, and a field evaluation was initiated
the next day.

   Foreign companies operating in the United
States chalked up $686 billion in U.S. sales in 1987 but paid a far
lower federal income tax rate than the average middle-income
family, the Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday.
   The U.S. subsidiaries together paid $5.6 billion in tax, a rate
of less than 1 percent of their income. By contrast, the typical
$35,000-a-year family paid at the rate of about 10 percent during
the same period, according to IRS estimates.
   The IRS submitted the new information to the House Ways and
Means oversight subcommittee, which for nine months has been
investigating the extent of tax dodging by some of the nearly
45,000 foreign companies that operate subsidiaries in this country.
   The subcommittee zeroed in on 36 U.S. distributors of foreign
cars, motorcycles and electronics, which accounted for a combined
$35 billion in retail sales in 1986.
   ``Some of the companies investigated have been operating in the
United States for years and have never sent a check to Uncle Sam
for one thin dime in corporate income taxes,'' said Rep. J.J.
Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee.
   ``They have failed to pay taxes despite the fact they have
profited from selling billions of dollars of cars, motorcycles,
stereos, televisions, VCRs, microwaves and other products to the
American consumer,'' Pickle said.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. agreed that foreign
corporations may be substantially understating their tax liability.
``But you can't jump too fast,'' he said. ``There may be other
causes,'' such as corporate structure and an inordinately high
number of new _ and, thus, less profitable _ companies among the
foreign-controlled subsidiaries.
   He agreed with the subcommittee investigators' conclusion that
the IRS often is outmanned by corporate experts in such complex
cases. He asked Congress for the authority to hire expert witnesses
without competitive bidding and urged higher pay scales for IRS
employees.
   Subcommittee investigators said the main factor in the
companies' ability to avoid taxes was ``transfer pricing'' _ a
practice in which a subsidiary typically pays an artificially
inflated price for goods purchased from its overseas parent. The
result is a lower taxable profit in the United States.
   Government officials have known for some time that foreign-owned
companies generally pay a considerably lower tax rate than domestic
corporations. About $13 billion of additional taxes assessed
against U.S. subsidiaries because of transfer pricing is pending in
appeals at the IRS and in the courts.
   Members of Congress are eyeing that money _ and even greater
amounts they say could be obtained with stiffer enforcement _ as
one way to cut the federal budget deficit.
   ``Before Congress acts to raise taxes on the average citizen in
order to reduce the deficit, we should be sure that U.S.
subsidiaries are paying their fair share of the current tax load,''
Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa., said at the hearing Tuesday.
   Congress acted last year to strengthen the IRS's hand in
investigating non-compliance by foreign corporations. A pending
bill would go even further.
   Pickle's investigators found that:
   _Over a 10-year period, more than half the foreign companies
they investigated paid little or no U.S. income tax.
   _One electronics distributor paid more than $150 million in
taxes over six years. A second company with similar products,
assets, receipts and distribution operations paid no tax at all.
Both are U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations. The difference:
transfer pricing.
   _For tax purposes, one company sold television sets to an
outside distributor for $150 but charged its own distributor $250.
One foreign carmaker charged its U.S. distributor $800 more than
its Canadian distributor.
   _Some foreign-owned subsidiaries have engaged in kickbacks and
imposed illegal freight and insurance charges as part of their
tax-avoidance schemes.
   _One electronics company grossed $4 billion over seven years and
reported tax liability of $15 million. Over 10 years, the IRS told
investigators, the company paid no tax because it used operating
losses to get refunds of what little tax it had paid during
profitable years.
   _Ten of the 18 car distributors investigated grossed $38 billion
in 1987 and paid $366 million in tax, again less than 1 percent.
But when operating losses are carried back, the rate will drop even
lower.
   The IRS said that while Japanese-controlled companies accounted
for 27 percent of receipts of U.S. subsidiaries in 1987, they paid
only 21 percent of the taxes. British-controlled subsidiaries had
15 percent of the sales but paid 31 percent of the taxes. West
German-owned companies rang up 9 percent of sales and paid 7.7
percent of the taxes.

<HEAD>Coalition Says More Funds Needed to Stop Deaths from Consumer
Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A coalition of consumer, health and insurance
groups said Tuesday that more federal leadership and money are
needed to help prevent 600,000 deaths that result each year from
consumer products.
   In releasing a status report, the Coalition for Consumer Health
&amp; Safety said 80 percent, or more than 480,000, of those deaths
involved cigarettes and alcohol.
   Stephen Brobeck, chairman of the coalition, said that ``while
there are hopeful trends, many improvements are needed.''
   ``Particularly discouraging is the recent rise in motor vehicle
and household product deaths. And the two most dangerous products _
cigarettes and alcohol _ still take a horrendous toll,'' he said.
   ``Federal agencies must increase their efforts in all of these
product areas. To do so they must be adequately funded,'' said
Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America,
which formed the coalition.
   Brobeck did not say how much money should be added to the effort
overall. But with respect to the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, he said its $35 million budget for this year should be
increased to $75 million.
   ``Politically that won't happen, but it should,'' he said.
   More money also needs to be channeled to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration and to combat AIDS and alcoholism,
Brobeck said, but he did not specify how much.
   The report focused on seven areas of concern: motor vehicle
safety, home and product safety, cigarette smoking, indoor air
pollution, food safety and nutrition, alcohol consumption and AIDS.
   Among the findings:
   _47,093 people were killed in motor vehicle accidents in 1988,
an increase of 1.5 percent from 1987 when 46,390 died on the
nation's roadways and a 0.6 percent rise from the previous year's
toll of 46,087.
   _Falls were the leading cause of fatal accidents in the home,
accounting for 6,500 deaths in 1988. Fires were the second-ranked
cause, followed by suffocation, poisoning, firearms and drownings.
   _Cardiovascular disease, one of the key factors for which is
diet, killed nearly 1 million Americans in 1987, while nutritional
deficiencies caused a reported 2,890 deaths in the United States
that year.
   _Cigarette smoking was responsible for 390,000 deaths in the
United States in 1985. Between 1965 and 1987, the proportion of
American adults who smoked dropped by 40 percent for men and 21
percent for women. About 49 million Americans still smoke
cigarettes.
   _Alcohol was involved in 90,991 deaths in 1986, up from 88,935
the previous year.
   The coalition of 37 groups includes 16 insurance companies and
associations as well as health groups, such as the American Academy
of Pediatrics and the American College of Preventive Medicine, and
consumer groups like the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

   An 80-year-old man serving a life
sentence for shooting his ailing wife to death has been moved to a
tougher prison as part of a general crackdown on prison security.
   Roswell Gilbert, whose mercy killing defense after the March
1985 shooting drew widespread publicity, was moved from the medium
security Lawtey Correctional Facility to a top security prison at
Lake Butler, said H. Edward Sands, assistant superintendent at
Lawtey.
   Last month, Donald Dillbeck, serving a mandatory life sentence
in the murder of a policeman, walked away from a work-release
program and was charged with killing a shopper outside a
Tallahassee mall.
   In response, Gov. Bob Martinez ordered inmates who are serving a
type of sentence that rules out early parole to be put in
top-security prisons. Among them was Gilbert.
   His attorney, Bradley Stark, said Gilbert's health could be
endangered by the stress of moving to another prison.
   ``It's pretty clear to me Roswell Gilbert shouldn't be in
prison. And secondly, if he is going to be in prison, he shouldn't
be in maximum security,'' Stark said.
   Gilbert suffers from lung and heart diseases and has undergone
surgery for bladder and urinary tract infections since he was
imprisoned, Stark said.
   On March 4, 1985, Gilbert, a retired engineer, shot and killed
his wife, Emily, in what he said was act of love, a mercy killing
to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He was convicted of
first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum
of 25 years in prison.
   His case was dramatized in a made-for-television movie.

   Thousands of Albanians seeking asylum in foreign
embassies in Tirana will be ferried to Italy under an agreement
being worked out between Albania and the United Nations, the
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
   ``We hope the operation can begin by the end of the week,'' a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Rome. He spoke on condition of
anonymity. Another source said it could begin as early as Thursday.
   A representative of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar was in the Albanian capital, Tirana, negotiating the
departure procedures on behalf of the almost a dozen embassies
where Albanians have taken refuge, he said.
   Under the agreement, the asylum-seekers would be ferried from
Albania's Adriatic port city of Durres to either Brindisi, about 85
miles away, or Otranto on the Italian coast, the spokesman said.
   The Italian government is working on contracting commercial
vessels to bring out the Albanians, the official said, adding he
expected that several trips would have to be made to evacuate them
all.
   The Italian Red Cross was preparing to provide assistance to
refugees arriving in Italy.
   Although foreign diplomats have estimated the number of
Albanians in the embassies at 5,000, the Italian spokesman said
there are about 3,000, including about 800 in the Italian Embassy.
More than 2,000 are believed to have taken refuge in the West
German Embassy alone.
   The asylum-seekers began taking refuge in the embassies on June
28 in a bid to escape Europe's last hard-line Communist regime.
Some dodged police bullets as they climbed over embassy gates.
   The Albanian ambassador to Italy, Dashnor Dervishi, said Tuesday
the Albanians in all the embassies were free to go. ``The problem
is resolved,'' he told a reporter, without referring to the news
that Italy is preparing to evacuate the asylum-seekers.
   ``If there is a delay it's because of the governments that
maintain these people like guests,'' Dervishi said. He described
those seeking asylum as ``hooligans.''
   The first 51 Albanians allowed to leave Tirana landed in
Czechoslovakia Tuesday. Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel sent
his official airplane to Tirana for the refugees.
   Italian officials reported Tuesday that six Albanians who fled
their country in a small boat were picked up in the Adriatic during
the night by a West German sailboat after their outboard motor
failed. They were brought to Lecce.
   Capt. Francesco Nistri of the port captain's office said the
six, aged 21 to 25, described themselves as political dissidents
and added they want to go to West Germany.
   In a telephone interview with the Italian news agency AGI,
Italy's ambassador in Tirana, Giorgio De Andreis, said the embassy
has completed paperwork to obtain exit permits for the Albanians in
his embassy.
   He said the situation inside was calm because the Albanians
``finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.''
   ``Nothing is decided yet,'' he said. ``We hope to resolve it
soon.''
   He told the news agency that most of the Albanians in the
embassy eventually want to go on to the United States, Canada and
Britain.
   Conditions in the dozen or so embassies harboring the Albanians
continued to be grim. Food, water and medicine were in short supply
because the Albanian leadership refused to allow foreign aid to
reach the missions.
   A baby was born Saturday in the West German Embassy, the most
crowded, and Czechoslovak officials said they had heard of a second
birth there.
   In Prague, the arriving Albanians were apparently unwilling to
talk about their experiences. They evaded reporters' questions upon
arrival, saying they feared for the safety of relatives back home.
   Some shouted, ``Long live Havel!'' before boarding buses at the
airport for a dormitory.
   One Albanian who made his way to Yugoslavia told reporters that
despite modest reforms, the Albanian government still was
oppressive and economic hardship was a part of daily life.
   Ari Ferhate Gjani, 36, told Yugoslavia's state Tanjug news
agency that police had been ordered to cease stopping people on the
street without reason. Still, he said, many Albanians, especially
the young, longed for more freedom.
   Many other Albanians seeking to emigrate have said they seek
better economic conditions.
   Antonio Bernardi, an Italian sales representative returning from
a business trip from Tirana, told a reporter at the Yugoslav border
crossing that many of the asylum-seekers were teen-agers or people
in their early twenties.
   Despite a police cordon around embassy row, parents of the
youths were allowed near the missions ``to try and persuade them to
return home,'' Bernardi said.
   Bernardi, who said he was a frequent traveler to Tirana, said
the capital's streets appeared peaceful away from the embassy
district.
   Albania's Communist leader, Ramiz Alia, began this year to
institute some economic reforms in the nation of 3.2 million and
sought to establish limited ties with other countries.
   For 45 years, travel for average Albanians has been virtually
impossible, but a package of new regulations entitles all Albanians
over age 16 to have a passport.

<HEAD>Creator Of Kellogg's `Snap, Crackle And Pop' Characters Dies at 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vernon Grant, creator of the Kellogg's
cereal characters Snap, Crackle and Pop and a longtime magazine and
book illustrator, has died. He was 88.
   He died Monday at a nursing home, where he had been for several
weeks.
   ``He was right up there with Norman Rockwell in the number of
covers he designed,'' said Linda Williams, chairwoman of the Vernon
Grant-Art Advisory Committee with the Museum of York County.
   The nursing home would not release a cause of death, but Ms.
Williams said he had been in declining health since he broke his
hip some months ago.
   Grant was born in Nebraska in 1902, and moved with his family to
California when he was a teen-ager. He studied at the University of
Southern California, and later at the Art Institute of Chicago.
   In 1932, a gnome figure he drew of Santa Claus landed on the
cover of Ladies' Home Journal and was a smashing success.
   A year later, inspired by a radio commercial for Kellogg's Rice
Krispies, he created the gnomelike characters of Snap, Crackle and
Pop. He submitted drawings to the company's ad agency.
   Overall, he designed 187 magazine covers from the 1930s to the
'50s, and illustrated children's books.
   In 1947, Grant and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to her hometown of
Rock Hill to raise their family and farm 600 acres. While living in
South Carolina, he developed a strain of grass and became known for
his conservation methods.
   Grant is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>Walker's Close Call Was Just One Incident, NASA Official Says</HEAD>

   The chief of the astronaut corps said Tuesday
that shuttle commander David M. Walker was suspended for more than
flying his jet trainer within 100 feet of a Pan Am airliner.
   ``It was an incident that was considered, you might say it was
one of the more severe incidents,'' Donald R. Puddy, director of
flight crew operations, said in a telephone interview from Houston.
``At the same time it was not the only one and not necessarily the
principal one.''
   He declined to elaborate, saying only that the space agency had
become concerned about ``some things in the manner which he was
flying.''
   Walker, a Navy captain who had flown in space twice, was
replaced on a Defense Department mission set for March 1991 and
suspended for 60 days from flying NASA's T-38 jet trainers.
   At the same time, NASA announced a one-year suspension for Navy
Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, who took part in a civilian air show race
last Saturday in which a pilot was killed.
   The suspensions are the first for NASA in nearly 30 years of
manned space flight.
   Neither Gibson nor Walker has had any public comment about the
suspensions, which were announced Monday.
   Puddy said he had ``no reason to believe that Dave is not going
to stay with the program and no reason to believe he will not
eventually be put back on T-38 flying status.''
   He said he had not talked with Gibson.
   ``My personal feeling is that other members of the astronaut
corps understand that there was a violation of policy and they also
understand we had to take the action,'' said Puddy.
   Until two years ago, NASA had no written guidelines for
astronaut behavior and tolerated some dangerous outside activities.
   Gordon Cooper, one of the Mercury Seven astronauts, was fond of
fast cars and was about to make his professional driving debut when
NASA stopped him. Four-time space flyer James Lovell fractured his
arm and shoulder while skiing. Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham
fractured a vertebra on a trampoline.
   In 1988, however, Puddy issued an order prohibiting astronauts
in training for flight from taking part in ``risky recreational
activities ... where there exists exposure of major, or even fatal,
injury.''
   He cited examples: ``Auto, boat, airplane or motorcycle racing;
parachute jumping; and snow skiing.''
   Gibson, a three-flight veteran, was considered to be one of
NASA's star commanders.
   Walker has a reputation as a hell-raiser. One space veteran
said, ``He's in the old mode of the Mercury astronauts. He likes
flying fast and he likes to race people.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board has not completed its
investigation of the Walker incident, which occurred May 15, 1989,
as he was flying his T-38 to Dulles International Airport to take
part in a White House ceremony.
   The pilot of the Pan Am Airbus reported the incident as a near
collision. NTSB spokesman Michael Benson said that the ``factual
report'' of the incident is due in about a week and that the
board's ruling on the probable cause of the incident will follow.
   The NTSB also is investigating the airshow death at New
Braunfels, Texas.
   The safety board is particularly interested, said Warren Wandel,
supervisory air safety investigator in the Dallas-Fort Worth
regional office, because it was the third air show fatality in four
weeks in his region. There have been seven deaths in seven
accidents nationwide this year.
   NASA's astronaut corps has 85 members; 62 of whom are in
training for 12 future shuttle flights.
   ``The rationale for our rules is to preserve the assigned
crews,'' said Puddy. ``We do not have enough people in the
astronaut office to provide backups for every single crew member
for all aspects of training.''
   It is been just over a year since astronaut S. David Griggs was
killed while performing aerial stunts in his World War II vintage
plane at an airshow.
   At the time, NASA spokesman Jeff Carr said the agency could not
police the astronauts.
   ``You can't lock these guys in their houses,'' he said. ``These
guys have thousands of hours flying experience. They take a greater
risk driving down the Gulf Freeway in Houston than by flying.''
   Air Force Col. Fred Gregory, who has been assigned to take
Walker's place on the 1991 mission, said it's easy for astronauts
to stray from the rules.
   ``All of us are pilots and all of us are very aggressive
pilots,'' he said. ``It's sometimes difficult for us to separate
our outside activities and our piloting skills and just the thrill
of flying. It's unfortunate in this particular case.
   ``Both Dave Walker and Hoot Gibson are terrific pilots, but this
is just a temporary activity and basically it's a wrist slapping.
Sometimes we have to do it to get somebody's attention.''

   Teimuraz Avaliani, the long-shot challenger to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for leader of the Communist Party, led
Siberian coal miners in a strike last summer and has a history of
challenging central authority.
   Alone among seven people nominated to face Gorbachev, Avaliani
refused to withdraw his candidacy. For his trouble, he was buried
in a Gorbachev landslide.
   Despite his rebellious background, Avaliani was cautious in a
speech before the vote.
   The nearly 4,700 delegates to the 28th congress of the Soviet
Communist Party listened quietly as the white-haired Avaliani,
wearing a gray suit, no tie, and a white shirt open at the collar,
said strikes were not always the best means of resolving disputes.
   ``When people don't have any clothes to wear, when they have
tried everything, and have appealed two or three times to the
highest authority and (the authorities) don't do anything, I don't
see any choice in this country but to strike,'' he said.
   But conditions varied by region, he said, and ``I have different
approaches to the strike movement in different concrete
situations.''
   He also advocated a strong army, KGB and police, recommended a
gradual rather than an abrupt shift to a market economy, and said
major businesses should remain under government control rather than
private ownership.
   On security issues, he said that ``the army, police, KGB and so
forth should be strong. ... In no case should the government allow
uncalled for attacks on them.''
   Gorbachev sat impassively through the speech, leaning on the
green felt dais with his arms crossed, and intently watching
Avaliani.
   The former strike leader received little applause and few votes.
Under the Soviet system in which voters cast positive and negative
ballots for each candidate, Avaliani received 501 votes for and
4,026 against.
   Gorbachev received 3,411 votes for and 1,116 votes against.
   Avaliani first entered the national scene early last year, when
a central newspaper reported that in the early 1970s, he had
written to then Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, suggesting that
he resign.
   Instead, Avaliani was forced out of his job as a plant director
in the Kuznetsk Basin of Western Siberia, the second-largest Soviet
coal field.
   In March 1989, Avaliani was elected to the Congress of People's
Deputies, the national parliament that selected from its members
the Supreme Soviet legislature and this March voted Gorbachev a new
five-year term as president.
   A year ago, Avaliani led a regional strike committee in the
Kuznetsk Basin, leading negotiations in which the government gave
in to virtually all the strikers demands.
   He is popular in Kuznetsk, and on April 4 was elected first
secretary of the Communist Party organization in Kiselyevsk.
   Alexei Solovyev, a member of the strike committee, said in a
telephone interview that miners were surprised at the moderate tone
of Avaliani's speech.
   ``I think that he betrayed our principles consenting to run for
this high position,'' said Solovyev, whose committee is organizing
a one-day protest strike Wednesday in defiance of pleas from
Gorbachev and the party congress.
   ``I am sure that this will have a negative effect on his
prestige down here,'' he said in a telephone interview from the
town of Kemerovo in the Kuznetsk Basin.

<HEAD>Magistrate Skirts Rules to Ease Sentencing of Underage Drinkers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magistrate who believes the legal drinking
age should be lowered skirted sentencing rules to let a group of
underage drinkers off the hook.
   District Justice Jacob Williams ordered youths cited for
underage drinking to perform 30 hours of community service. A state
law requires a 90-day drivers license suspension for the first
underage-drinking offense.
   ``I am going to get hung by the bosses in Harrisburg for doing
this,'' Williams said after sentencing Monday. ``I believe the
penalty is too stiff a sentence for what they have done. It is not
my prerogative to second-guess the legislators, but the sentence is
too stiff.''
   Cynthia Scopetti, a spokeswoman for Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, disagreed, claiming alcohol-related accidents among 16- to
20-year-olds had decreased since the law was passed in 1988.
   ``MADD agrees that the pain of losing a driver's license is hard
on a youth, but it is a small price to pay when you compare it to
even the loss of one life,'' she said.
   Sixty-six youths were charged with underage drinking after a
rock concert at the Civic Arena in June.
   Williams has disposed of about 20 cases by throwing out the
charges or declaring the defendant guilty but not recording the
verdict, thereby skirting the mandatory sentence.
   About 40 cases are pending.
   Williams said the drinking age should be lowered from 21 to 18,
because ``when they are 18 or older we give them the right to vote
and serve in the armed services.''

<HEAD>San Francisco Supervisors: `Protect Artists' Rights'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's Board of Supervisors has
condemned the federal criminal investigation of an artist who
photographs naked children.
   ``This resolution lets the nation know that this city does not
support the attack on the First Amendment rights that artists are
experiencing in this country,'' Supervisor Terence Hallinan said at
Monday's meeting.
   The resolution, approved 9-2, urges the U.S. attorney's office
to drop its investigation of Jock Sturges, a 43-year-old San
Francisco photographer whose collection includes black and white
pictures of ``naturists,'' children and adults who prefer to go
without clothes.
   It also urges the San Francisco district attorney's office to
drop criminal charges against Sturges' film developer, Joseph
Semien.
   Semien was arrested in April and charged with two felony counts
of possessing child pornography with intent to distribute and 10
misdemeanor possession counts after he picked up photos from Newell
Colour, a professional film developing lab.
   According to police records, a lab employee reported Semien to
the FBI after he brought in negatives showing naked girls aged 9 to
11.
   Sturges has not been charged, but he is the target of a federal
grand jury probe.
   Hallinan, who wrote the resolution, cited pending obscenity
charges against the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center and its
director for displaying Robert Mapplethorpe photos of naked
children and the National Endowment for the Arts' recent
withholding of funds for art it considered offensive.
   Sturges argues that his pictures of naked children are artistic,
tasteful and taken with the consent of their parents.
   Many of the pictures were taken at California beaches where the
``naturists'' gather.

<HEAD>Textron Settles for $17.9 Million in Helicopter Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Lycoming agreed Tuesday to pay the
government $17.9 million to settle a fraud investigation focusing
on the company's problem-plagued Coast Guard helicopter engines.
   The settlement is the largest ever reached under the Justice
Department's ``whistleblower'' lawsuit program.
   Robert C. Ballew, a procurement official for the prime
manufacturer of the Coast Guard HH-65A Dolphin helicopters, will
receive $2.7 million for his role in filing the original suit
against Textron in May 1988.
   Textron, based in Stratford, Conn., was under investigation for
providing engines that failed to meet their operating
specifications and for fraudulently billing the Coast Guard for
repair work, according to the Justice Department. The helicopters
are used in search-and-rescue and drug interdiction missions.
   Former Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost once referred to the
engine as ``a lemon.''
   Separate investigations by the National Transportation Safety
Board have shown, according to published reports, that at least 14
deaths are attributable to failures of the LTS-101 engine,
manufactured by Textron's Lycoming Williamsport, Pa., plant. The
engine is used in private helicopters as well as air ambulances,
commercial choppers and Air National Guard helicopters.
   ``This settlement sends a clear message that the government will
simply not tolerate fraud perpetrated against the American
taxpayer,'' said Stuart Gerson, assistant attorney general for the
Justice Department's civil division.
   Textron also agreed to maintain the engines and supply parts for
the next six years and be paid a fee based on the engine flying
time. That provision could save the Coast Guard an estimated $60
million, according to the Justice Department.
   ``This arrangement will increase Textron Lycoming's incentive to
improve the engines' longevity, since Textron Lycoming will now
bear the costs of the replacement parts,'' Gerson said.
   The two-year government investigation showed that the engines
were operating at higher temperatures than was called for in their
initial design. As a result, the engines were deteriorating faster
than expected. The engine was supposed to fly for 2,400 hours
between overhauls. It usually lasted less than 600 hours before
expensive repairs were required.
   The probe also turned up evidence that Textron charged the Coast
Guard for work related to repairing engine defects even though the
Coast Guard had stated it would not pay the charges.
   Textron issued a written statement that admitted no wrongdoing.
But the company said it hoped to normalize relations with the Coast
Guard and pledged to maintain ``the reliability and mission
availability of the engines.''
   Textron said it had set aside money for the settlement and that
the $17.9 million payment will have ``no material impact'' on the
company's bottom line.
   Ballew, 43, of Fort Worth, Texas, worked for Aerospatiale

<HEAD>Critics Suggest Peru Gov't Involvement in Rebel Prison Break</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Miguel Castro Castro name is correct</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition politicians said Tuesday the prison
escape of one of Peru's top guerrilla leaders was ``highly
suspicious'' and suggested the possibility of government complicity
in the breakout.
   Victor Polay, a leader of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, and 47 other suspected members crawled to
freedom early Monday through an elaborate block-and-a-half-long
tunnel built under the Miguel Castro Castro prison in northeastern
Lima.
   Polay, whose brother-in-law, Paul Caro, is health minister,
escaped 18 days before the administration of President Alan Garcia
is to leave office at the expiration of its five-year term. Alberto
Fujimori is president-elect.
   The Garcia government has been hobbled by high inflation and a
protracted guerrilla war, primarily involving the Shining Path, a
violent Maoist organization that operates mainly in the northern
and eastern Andean highlands.
   Criticism of the prison escape was quick: Senator-elect Alberto
Borea of the center-right Fredemo coalition said, ``It's quite a
coincidence that in the government's final days the terrorist
Victor Polay should escape. He was a close friend of many Aprista
Party members (and) I find it highly suspicious.''
   Polay, 38, is the son of one of the founders of the center-left
Aprista Party now headed by Garcia. In the early 1970s Polay
studied in Europe with Garcia.
   Leftist congressman Manuel Dammert called on Interior Minister
Agustin Mantilla to resign.
   ``It's unheard of that one of the most dangerous terrorists in
the country has escaped from what is supposed to be the country's
most secure prison,'' Dammert said.
   Former Interior Minister Gen. Luis Cisneros said in a television
interview Monday night he learned that police intelligence
personnel had information six weeks ago that there would be an
attempted breakout. He called the mass escape ``inexplicable.''
   Police captured Polay on Feb. 3, 1989. He was facing charges of
terrorism in connection with the deaths of more than 100 policemen
and his trial was expected to conclude in a few weeks.
   The day after his arrest he received a private visit by
then-Prime Minister Armando Villanueva. Villanueva was roundly
criticized over the visit, which he said he did as a friend of the
Polay family.
   Investigators said the six-foot-wide escape tunnel was built
nearly 20 feet underground. They said it had its own lighting and
ventilation system and probably took six to 10 months to build.
   The exit opened into an adobe shanty 500 feet from the prison
walls. Neighbors said a young couple who lived in the house have
disappeared.
   In statements to the press Garcia called the escape
``scandalous,'' and promised a complete investigation of
corrections department personnel who were on duty.
   Police said Monday night they had detained 20,000 people in a
massive sweep through Lima for the escapees. Most were later
released.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement took up arms against the
government in 1984 and is believed to have about 1,000 combatants.
   In January three Tupac Amaru guerrillas assassinated former
Defense Minister Enrique Lopez in the parking lot of a Lima
shopping center. In October the group kidnapped Hector Delgado, a
prominent businessman who was an adviser to Garcia. Delgado was
released in April, but no details of the negotiations surrounding
his release were released.
   Some officials and newspaper editorials suggested Tuesday that
Polay could have been allowed to escape as part of a trade that
also involved Delgado's freedom.
   The Tupac Amaru group takes its name from an 18th Century
revolutionary who led a successful revolt against Spanish colonial
rule in the Andes, which run north to south through Peru.
   In a communique distributed Monday the guerrillas pledged to
continue their fight after Fujimori takes office on July 28.

   A woman who falsely accused a man of raping
her is appealing an unorthodox perjury sentence that requires her
to pay for advertisements apologizing to the man.
   The appeal, filed Monday in Dawson County District Court, claims
that Elizabeth Irene Richardson's sentence violates her rights to
free speech, due process and protection from cruel and unusual
punishment.
   The sentence also is an improper delegation of judicial
authority and not a permissible condition of probation, the appeal
said.
   Ms. Richardson, 24, accused Gary Nitsch, 44, of raping her in
September 1988. He was arrested and charged with sexual assault.
Ms. Richardson testified that Nitsch raped her, but the case was
dropped for lack of evidence.
   Word later reached authorities that Ms. Richardson told friends
the rape was a hoax. She was convicted of perjury in February.
   County Attorney John Marsh said the woman's motives centered on
trying to get the attention of her husband, a truck driver who was
often away from home.
   A hearing has been set in county court July 17 before the same
judge that sentenced Ms. Richardson. She will ask District Judge
John Murphy to suspend her sentence and allow her to remain free on
bail until the Nebraska Supreme Court rules on her appeal.
   Murphy ordered Ms. Richardson to apologize to Nitsch in a
half-page advertisement in every newspaper and a prime-time spot on
each radio station in this county of about 22,000 in central
Nebraska.
   The media campaign was expected to cost about $1,000. She also
was sentenced June 8 to 180 days in jail and placed on two years'
probation.
   Tod McKeone, Ms. Richardson's attorney, said he has found no
precedent to support the appeal.
   ``We've got a long way to go,'' he said. ``Since we had to file
the appeal 30 days after the sentence, there was not enough time to
dig in and find favorable precedent. You just have to hope you run
into some things, too, that will help.''

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl put courtesy
over protocol Tuesday when he came to a doorway abreast of Italian
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti.
   The two leaders were at the back of the pack of summit leaders
who ambled into the faculty club at Rice University for lunch.
   Protocol strictly dictates most comings and goings, with those
longest in office entitled to come last and depart first.
   Andreotti only became Italy's prime minister last July 30, while
Kohl has led the Federal Republic for eight years.
   When Andreotti got to the door of the Cohen House, he held back
for a moment to let his German colleague pass.
   Kohl, a bear-sized man who towers over the Italian prime
minister, would have none of it. He bowed and gestured for
Andreotti to go ahead.
   Andreotti demurred.
   Kohl insisted.
   Finally, the Alphonse-Gaston routine ended.
   Andreotti went first. Kohl followed.

   A major earthquake struck a sparsely
populated jungle region of southern Sudan but there were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties, officials said Tuesday.
   It was the second earthquake in the Juba region in less than two
months.
   Military intellegence officials said the ``extent of damage or
loss of life has yet to be determined in view of the remoteness''
of the area hit by the tremor.
   In Cairo, Ezz-el-Din Ibrahim, director of the earthquake
department at Egypt's National Research Institute of Astronomy and
Geophysics, said the quake struck Monday afternoon and measured 6.6
on the Richter scale.
   ``It had the capability of causing widespread damage,'' he said.
   Officials at the Hong Kong Observatory said Tuesday the
earthquake measured 6.5 and its epicenter was in an area about 56
miles north of Juba in southern Sudan.
   United Nations officials said the temblor did not cause damage
in Juba, but no information was available on the surrounding areas.
   The same region was struck by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the
Richter scale on May 20.
   The relief agency of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army,
said the May earthquake left 31 people dead and 300,000 without
shelter. The rebels have been fighting the government since 1983.
   Thirty of the dead perished when their homes slid into the Nile
River.

   Barbara Bush says an enormous rat swam by her in
the White House pool recently but President Bush came to her rescue
and ``drowned the beast.''
   The rat she encountered in the incident several months ago ``did
not look like a Walt Disney friend, I'll tell you that,'' she said
in an interview published by newspapers in Houston and San Antonio
on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Bush, who was back in Texas for the economic summit, said
her husband came to her aid at the outdoor pool.
   ``I swim with a mask, so as it went right by in front of me _ I
mean, it was enormous,'' said Mrs. Bush, a mile-a-day swimmer.
``Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned the beast. It was
horrible.''
   The White House grounds attract rats, she said, ``because we're
surrounded by parks and people drop food.''
   Or, she theorized it was an effort to get rid of the rodents
that may have led this one to find its way into the White House
pool.
   ``They put some stuff out that only bothered rats, and what it
did is make them very, very thirsty. And this rat went for the
biggest water it saw,'' she explained.
   She also credited her English springer spaniel Millie with
helping reduce the local rat population.
   For a long time afterward, she said, she insisted that her
guards check to make sure there wasn't a rat ``in hiding'' before
she entered the pool.
   On another subject, she said her husband was ``absolutely
exhausted'' when he got to Houston Friday night from the NATO
summit in London. But she added that they have both been delighted
by the warm reception Houstonians have given their international
guests.
   After viewing the friendly crowds along a motorcade route to
Rice University, ``I told George that this is the first time I've
gone that far in a car back and forth where everybody waved and no
unfriendly gestures,'' she said.
   She said Houston's heat was not too much for the summit spouses.
   ``All of these ladies have been in hot places before,'' she
said. ``I've been to Malaysia on state trips and you just learn to
glow in public. ... How much are they outdoors? Nothing. Twenty
minutes at the most.''
   Mrs. Bush took several of the spouses to San Antonio on Tuesday
for a tour of the Alamo and other sights.
   The White House released a full transcript of Mrs. Bush's
interview Monday by the Houston Chronicle, the Houston Post, the
San Antonio Light and the San Antonio Express News.

<TEXT>
   A century of statehood was celebrated
Tuesday in Wyoming with free Buffalo burgers and a reminder that
the state was the first to give women voting rights.
   Under mostly sunny skies state officials and dignitaries in
Cheyenne re-enacted the statehood ceremonies led in 1890 by Francis
E. Warren, Wyoming's last territorial governor and its first
elected governor.
   The thousands who jammed the Statehouse lawns to watch the event
cheered time and again at the mention of women's rights.
   Gov. Mike Sullivan, reciting Warren's speech, generated cheers
when he got to the section noting that Wyoming's Constitution
granted ``free and equal suffrage to its citizens, regardless of
sex.''
   That section had troubled U.S. senators who on June 27, 1890,
were shocked by the idea that this frontier territory seeking
admission into the Union wanted to give women the right to vote. A
senator from Alabama said women were too dainty to dabble in
politics.
   But when the issue came to a vote the Senate gave its approval
29-18. On July 10, 1890, President Benjamin Harrison signed the
bill admitting Wyoming to the Union as the 44th state _ and the
first to grant women the right to vote.
   This rich history was lost on 9-year-old Steve Miller of
Cheyenne, who came downtown at 6 a.m. so he could be first in line
for one of the 10,000 buffalo burgers being given away free.
   Five hours later, Steve had a burger, pickles, and potato chips
on his plate and he found a spot on the lawn to enjoy the meal. He
would have gone back for seconds but, ``They got to serve the other
people,'' he said matter-of-factly.

   Here is a text of the political declaration
issued Tuesday at the 1990 economic summit of industrialized
nations:
   Securing Democracy:
   1. We, the leaders of our seven countries and the
representatives of the European Community, salute the men and women
around the world whose courage and wisdom have inspired and brought
about the historic advances of democracy we have witnessed over the
past year. As we enter the final decade of this century, which we
intend should be a decade of democracy, we reiterate our commitment
to support the strengthening of democracy, human rights, and
economic reconstruction and development through market-oriented
economies. We emphasize the important opportunity provided in this
forum for representatives from Europe, Japan, and North America to
discuss critical challenges of the coming years.
   2. Europe is at the dawn of a new era. We welcome
enthusiastically the profound and historic changes sweeping the
continent. The London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic
Alliance provides a new basis for cooperation among former
adversaries in building a stable, secure, and peaceful Europe. We
are determined to seize all opportunities to achieve a Europe whole
and free and recognize the European Community's contribution to
that effort. We applaud the unification of Germany, which is a
tangible expression of mankind's inalienable right to
self-determination and a major contribution to stability in Europe.
   We welcome the replacement of repressive regimes in Central and
Eastern Europe by governments freely chosen by their peoples. We
applaud the introduction of the rule of law and the freedoms that
are the bedrock of a democratic state. We urge Romania, following
recent events, to adhere to the positive trend taking place in
other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
   3. We welcome the intention of the Soviet Union to move toward a
democratic political system, as well as Soviet attempts to reform
their economy along market principles. We commit ourselves to
working with the Soviet Union to assist its efforts to create an
open society, a pluralistic democracy, and a market-oriented
economy. Such changes will enable the Soviet Union to fulfill its
responsibilities in the community of nations founded on these
principles. We are heartened by indications that a constructive
dialogue is under way between the Soviet government and the Baltic
states, and we urge all sides to continue this dialogue in a
democratic spirit.
   4. The advance of democracy accompanied by market-oriented
economic reforms is not just a European phenomenon. Since we last
met, we have witnessed the spread of democratic values in many
parts of the world.
   In Asia, there are encouraging signs of new political openness
in Mongolia and Nepal. In the Philippines, the government continues
to engage in courageous efforts to consolidate democracy.
   We acknowledge some of the recent developments in China, but
believe that the prospects for closer cooperation will be enhanced
by renewed political and economic reform, particularly in the field
of human rights. We agree to maintain the measures put into place
at last year's summit, as modified over the course of this year. We
will keep them under review for future adjustments to respond to
further positive developments in China. For example, in addition to
existing lending to meet basic human needs, we will explore whether
there are other World Bank loans that would contribute to reform of
the Chinese economy, especially loans that would address
environmental concerns.
   5. In Africa, we hope that Namibia's attainment of independence
and democracy will be a positive example for freedom, pluralism,
and market-oriented economic reform throughout the continent. We
also welcome the positive developments that have taken place in
South Africa, especially the launching of talks between the
government and representatives of the black majority. We hope this
will lead to a peaceful transition to a non-racial democracy and
the complete dismantlement of the apartheid system. We will
continue to support this process and we call on all parties to
refrain from violence or its advocacy.
   6. In Latin America, we welcome the re-establishment of freedom
and democracy in Chile. We applaud the recent fair and free
elections in Nicaragua, as well as progress on the path to peace
through dialogue in El Salvador and Guatemala. We encourage the
efforts of the Panamanian government to re-establish democracy and
the rule of law. We note with satisfaction the positive evolution
in Haiti. We hope that Cuba will take steps to join the democratic
trend in the rest of Latin America.
   7. While we applaud the reduction of ideological conflicts that
have divided much of the world since the end of the Second World
War, we note with deep concern the reemergence of intolerance
affecting ethnic and religious groups. We agree that such
intolerance can lead to conflicts, which can threaten fundamental
human rights, as well as political and economic development.
   8. We reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental principles we
seek to realize in our own societies, and we underscore that
political and economic freedoms are closely linked and mutually
reinforcing. Each of us stands ready to help in practical ways
those countries that choose freedom, through the provision of
constitutional, legal, and economic know-how and through economic
assistance, as appropriate.
   In drawing from our different constitutional and historical
experiences, we stand ready, individually and jointly in relevant
fora, to:
   _ Assist in the drafting of laws, including bills of rights and
civil, criminal and economic framework laws.
   _ Advise in the fostering of independent media.
   _ Establish training programs in government, management, and
technical fields.
   _ Develop and expand people-to-people contacts and exchange
programs to help diffuse understanding and knowledge.
   In the same spirit, the recent G-24 Ministerial agreed to extend
its assistance in Central and Eastern Europe in parallel with
progress in political and economic reform.
   We agree the challenge facing the industrialized democracies is
to continue the effort already under way in Europe while expanding
efforts to support political reform and economic development in
other parts of the world. We call on our people and the people of
other democracies to join in this great endeavor.

   Bulgaria's first freely elected
Parliament in 58 years faced a constitutional crisis on Tuesday as
it convened its inaugural session without a president.
   Petar Mladenov resigned the presidency last Friday after
admitting he suggested in December that tanks be used to disperse
tens of thousands of demonstrators rallying against communist power.
   Mladenov had been instrumental a month earlier in toppling
Bulgaria's hard-line leaders, but the Communist Party remained in
control of the government. The party later renamed itself the
Socialist Party.
   Meanwhile, the student protesters who forced Mladenov's
resignation continued a sit-down strike in front of the
presidential palace in Sofia, the capital.
   The students, camped in about 150 tents near the palace, said
they had collected nearly 9,000 signatures on petitions demanding
the new president be a non-Socialist and that Premier Andrei
Lukanov resign, the official BTA news agency said.
   The petitions also called for a public and televised trial of
ousted Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov.
   The students began their sit-in to protest alleged manipulations
in last month's parliamentary elections, in which the Socialists
won a majority of seats.
   The new parliament's opening ceremony was held in a wood-paneled
hall in this ancient Bulgarian capital, 150 miles northeast of
Sofia.
   The opening session, a ceremonial affair held in sweltering
heat, was adjourned after only 40 minutes and will resume July 17
at the parliament building in Sofia. It was opened by Yosif Petrov,
at 81 the oldest deputy.
   In a brief opening speech, Alexander Lilov, chairman of the
Socialist Party, said: ``The time of the totalitarian parliament is
over. Now is the time of the democratic parliament.''
   But he added: ``We are against chaos and destabilization in the
country. Everyone has the right to protest, but everyone has also
the obligation to work.''
   As the Parliament convened, three small right-wing nationalist
parties organized demonstrations in Veliko Turnovo and other cities
to protest the representation of ethnic Turks in the legislature.
   BTA said anti-Turkish protesters staged five-minute strikes in
the northern city of Razgrad and the southern city of Kurdzhali,
where almost half the population are ethnic Turks.
   The news agency said nationalist demonstrators also staged a
two-hour blockade of the highway linking Ruse near the Romanian
border and the Black Sea port of Varna.
   The protesters were demanding the new parliament invalidate the
election of 23 ethnic Turkish deputies representing the Movement
for Rights and Freedoms.
   They accused the primarily ethnic Turkish party of cherishing
``pan-Turkish and pan-Islamic aspirations,'' BTA said.
   The party's leader, Ahmed Dogan, who was attending the opening
parliamentary session, refused comment on the protests.
   The Movement for Rights and Freedoms is the third largest party
in the 400-seat Grand National Assembly, or parliament. The
Socialists have 211 seats and the Union of Democratic Forces, the
main opposition coalition, have 144.
   The Grand National Assembly's first task will be to agree on a
presidential candidate and elections. There is no precedent for
electing a president in Bulgaria's parliamentary history.
   The Parliament may either decide to elect the president or call
a referendum.
   Mladenov's departure came less than three weeks after his party
of reformed Communists won the elections.
   Mladenov was instrumental in the ousting of Zhivkov. Prodded by
popular demonstrations, Mladenov then played a key role in
reforming the party.
   His departure has weakened the ruling Socialists and created a
power vacuum.
   In another development, the chief prosecutor's office announced
that it will complete its preliminary investigation of Zhivkov on
July 18. The prosecutor would then have one month to decide whether
to put Zhivkov on trial, and, if so, set a date for the proceedings.
   Zhivkov has been under investigation for alleged abuse of power,
incitement to ethnic hatred and misappropriation of state property.
   One of the ousted leader's defense attorney's protested the
announcement of a date for concluding the investigation, saying it
created the impression that Zhivkov's defense is being ignored.

   Western leaders paid tribute Tuesday to East
Europeans who have overthrown repressive regimes to bring about
political and economic changes on their continent. They urged
troubled Romania to follow the example of its neighbors.
   President Bush and the leaders of six other rich democracies
attending their annual economic summit hailed the moves in Central
and Eastern Europe toward democratically elected governments and
free-market economies.
   ``Europe is at the dawn of a new era,'' they said in a political
statement. ``We welcome enthusiastically the profound and historic
changes sweeping the continent.''
   They said they wanted to ``seize all opportunities to achieve a
Europe whole and free'' and welcomed the drive toward unification
of the two German states. The German merger, they said, should
contribute to stability in Europe.
   The leaders called on Romania ``to adhere to the positive
trend'' unfolding in neighboring countries. The Bucharest
government has been accused of complicity in the recent violent
repression of anti-government protestors.
   They said they were ready to give fledgling democracies needed
constitutional, legal and economic advice and financial assistance
``as appropriate.''
   The leaders' remarks underscored their efforts to aid the
countries in Eastern Europe as they pull away from the Soviet
Union, long their main support.
   At last year's summit in Paris, Bush and his counterparts asked
the European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, to fashion an
aid program to encourage the changes unfolding in Poland and
Hungary.
   In just a year, two-dozen wealthy nations, including the United
States, France, West Germany and Japan, have promised to give more
than $12 billion in loans, technical advice and food supplies to
Poland and Hungary.
   Reacting to appeals from other East European countries, they
agreed last week to draw Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia into the program. Romania was temporarily denied
membership because of the political repression there.
   It's not known how much the West will be able to raise for the
four new additions to the aid program but help will likely be
substantial.
   In a report on the program, the community's executive body said
the assistance ``is making a major contribution'' in helping the
sick economies of Poland and Hungary.
   ``It has underpinned a radical stabilization program in Poland,
which might otherwise have proved too risky, and helped both
countries to begin modernizing their economies,'' it said.
   In handing out the aid, the Western nations insist that the new
democracies commit themselves to the rule of law, respect for human
rights, introduce multi-party political systems, hold free and fair
elections, and impose economic reforms.
   ``Leaders in Central and Eastern Europe who seek radical change
in their countries' political and economic systems, accept the
conditionality attaching to (Western) assistance as a spur to
reform,'' said the community report.
   ``It is also a guarantee to their peoples that the international
community is paying close attention to the respect for political
and economic freedom in their countries,'' it said.
   The money is designed to help East European officials change
their outdated economies from centrally planned ones to free-market
systems.
   To do that, the governments must build from the ground up.
   They need to get rid of government subsidies to farmers and
others, stabilize prices and bolster worthless currencies. They
must develop banking systems and labor markets.
   The community said in its report that the changes are
indispensable but may well lead, at least temporarily, to higher
unemployment and reduced living standards.

   Soviet coal miners walked off the job
early Wednesday in a 24-hour strike aimed at pressing the
government to resign and the Communist Party to give up its
privileges.
   Strike committee spokesman Alexei Solovyev said miners struck in
the Kuznetsk coal basin of western Siberia as the new day began. In
Donetsk, center of the eastern Ukraine's coal-mining region, strike
committee organizers fanned out to boost support among miners for a
one-day strike and rally Wednesday.
   In a telephone interview from Kemerovo, Solovyev estimated
300,000 miners would walk out in western Siberia. He said 61 of 130
mines would strike for the entire day, and the rest would strike
for part of the day.
   Workers from 20 major industrial enterprises will join them, he
said.
   In Donetsk, strike leaders presented demands that the government
of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov resign; that Communist Party
representation be eliminated at factories and mines, in the KGB,
army and police; that political education classes for young
children be eliminated; and that party property be nationalized.
   Organizers said about half the Donetsk area's 250 mines would
strike on Wednesday, and the rest would show support by sending
representatives to a demonstration in Donetsk.
   At a rally Tuesday night attended by about 150 miners, strike
organizer Yevgeny Moiseyev asked them to support him in ``putting
the party on trial.''
   A handwritten notice calling for Ryzhkov's resignation was
posted on a bulletin board next to official notices about mine
activities.
   Workers at the Kalinin and Panfilovsky shafts in the Donetsk
basin, in the eastern Ukraine, voted this week to evict party
representatives from mine offices.
   The Postfactum news service, affiliated with Moscow radio,
reported that 12 of 13 mines in the Vorkuta area of the Soviet Far
North voted to join the walkout.
   Miners from all three regions walked out last summer, demanding
more pay and improved vacation benefits, better housing and better
supplies of consumer goods.
   Miners say the government has not fulfilled its promises to
improve conditions for them.
   The strike came during the Communist Party's 28th Congress in
Moscow, and a day after Teimuraz Avaliani, a leader of last year's
strike in the Kemerovo region, stood against Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in the election for party leadership.
   Gorbachev easily defeated Avaliani, and Solovyev said Avaliani's
candidacy would hurt his popularity among miners who are highly
critical of the Communist Party.
   ``I think that he betrayed our prinicples consenting to run for
this high position,'' Solovyev said. ``I am sure that this will
have a negative effect on his prestige down here.''

   Showers and thunderstorms dumped heavy rain on parts of central
Pennsylvania early Tuesday, with scattered storms from Kansas to
Illinois.
   The storms dumped one to two inches of rain by Tuesday afternoon
in Armstrong County, Pa., where 5.1 inches fell Monday.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing along the same stationary
front that was operating in Pennsylvania were scattered from Kansas
through Missouri and Iowa to Illinois during the early afternoon.
Norfolk, Neb. received 1\ inches of rain during the six hour period
ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms ranged from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast states, and along
the central Gulf Coast, with showers and thunderstorms rather
numerous in southern Florida. Key West received more than 1{ inches
of rain.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies west of the Rockies.
   Temperatures warmed into the 90s from the southern Plains to the
southern and middle Atlantic Coast region, with readings near 100
degrees in South Carolina.
   The temperature at the airport in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., reached
97 degrees, setting a record high for the date and the hottest day

   French war criminal Paul Touvier visited a
Jesuit college on Tuesday where his pro-Nazi militia imprisoned
seven Jews before executing them during World War II.
   Touvier, 74, who worked closely with Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus
Barbie during the occupation, left his prison cell near Paris under
armed guard to visit his former headquarters.
   The tour was ordered by Jean-Pierre Getti, the magistrate
gathering evidence to prosecute Touvier on charges of crimes
against humanity.
   Touvier and other witnesses, some wearing hoods to conceal their
identities, together toured the grounds of the college that served
as a militia detention center in mid-1944.
   One charge accuses Touvier of responsibility in executing seven
Jewish detainees on June 28, 1944. The prisoners were shot in
nearby Rilleux-la-Pape in reprisal for a Resistance raid.
   On Monday, Robert Nathan, whose father was arrested on May 19,
1944, by Touvier and executed three months later, asked Getti to
open up a new charge of crimes against humanity against Touvier.
   Touvier was arrested during the liberation of France, but
escaped. He was twice convicted of war crimes and sentenced to
death in his absence. Under a 20-year statute of limitations, those
sentences could not be carried out.
   In 1973, he went into hiding after new charges were raised and
was not found until police arrested him in May 1989 at the St.
Francis Priory in Nice.
   The priory was run by followers of Archbishop Marcel Lefevbre,
the fundamentalist priest excommunicated from the Roman Catholic
Church.
   Touvier denies responsibility for killings, torture and sending
suspects to the Gestapo during the war. He also denies blowing up a
synagogue in 1943.
   Barbie was convicted in 1987 of crimes against humanity and is
serving a life sentence in France. Getti questioned Barbie and
others last month.

   A television newsman jailed for refusing to
identify a confidential source emerged free from a courtroom
Tuesday after giving the judge his source's name.
   The source released KMOL-TV reporter Brian Karem from his
promise of confidentiality Monday night, Karem said, after the U.S.
Supreme Court declined his second request to be freed.
   ``I want to see my wife and my son and take a day off and eat
some pizza and drink some beer and never wear orange again,'' Karem
said after his release.
   The 29-year-old broadcast journalist, who wore an orange uniform
during his two weeks in jail, was held in contempt of court and
sentenced to six months in jail for refusing to say who helped
arrange a telephone interview last year with jailed murder suspect
Henry David Hernandez.
   Hernandez and his brother, Julian, are charged in the March 1989
shooting death of a San Antonio police officer. Henry David
Hernandez told Karem that he shot policeman Gary Williams in
self-defense.
   Lawyers in the Hernandez case said they needed to know who
arranged the interview to determine whether it could be admitted as
evidence.
   Karem on Tuesday identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a
cousin of Hernandez's. He handed over a notebook page containing
names and phone numbers of those who helped set up the interview.
   The reporter said he would do it again if it meant keeping a
promise to a source.
   ``I didn't intend to prove anything. I just intended to keep my
promise, so I kept my promise,'' he said.
   State District Judge Pat Priest questioned the woman's need to
remain anonymous, then freed Karem from the contempt citation.
   Outside the courtroom, Karem kissed and hugged his wife Pam.
Their 18-month-old son Zachary, who had been carried out of the
courtroom when he shouted ``Daddy, Daddy, Daddy'' and waved at
Karem, slept in a stroller.
   Karem accused lawyers in the Hernandez case of using him to do
their investigative work.
   ``The press should be the last place that prosecutors and
defense attorneys go to seek their information _ not the first,''
Karem said. ``They never tried anyone else before they came to me.''
   Defense attorneys and prosecutors grilled Karem about whether
Bexar County Sheriff Harlon Copeland helped arrange the interview.
Although Copeland's name was in his notes, Karem said he did not
speak with him directly in setting up the phone conversation.
   Last week Copeland said he tracked down Karem's source and
correctly identified her. But Karem had refused to confirm Ms.
Ledesma was his source.
   Ms. Ledesma, now living in Santa Clara, Calif., told attorneys
Monday she arranged a conversation in March 1989 between Hernandez
and Karem. Karem said that was one of two phone conversations he
had with Hernandez that night.
   Karem said he agreed to keep Ms. Ledesma's name secret because
she feared some of Hernandez's family members.
   ``She didn't want her name attached to it, and she even said she
didn't want her employer knowing I was talking to her,'' Karem said.
   Karem lost two Supreme Court bids to remain free while he
appealed the contempt of court citation. His appeal of the
citation, which was still before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, now becomes moot.

   An asteroid hurtled across Earth's orbit
at a distance of only 3 million miles Tuesday _ a close encounter
on the astronomical scale, planetary scientists said.
   The asteroid, dubbed 1990 MF, made one of the closer crossings
of Earth orbit observed in the last 50 years. It had been tracked
since Jet Propulsion Laboratory planetary scientist Eleanor Helin
discovered it on June 26.
   The rocky object's diameter was estimated at 300 feet to 1,000
feet and it was projected to have accelerated to 22,000 mph at its
closest approach.
   Helin, head of the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, said
there are a dozen asteroids that are considered to have come
relatively close.
   The closest was last year when an asteroid passed at a distance
of 460,000 to 480,000 miles from Earth. An earlier one was just
under 500,000 miles. The 1990 MF asteroid is among 10 in the 3
million-mile range.
   ``These are all close encounters astronomically,'' Helin said.

   Protests in March against austerity measures and corruption grew
into violent anti-government demonstrations demanding that
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny relinquish his 30-year monopoly on
power. The protests forced him to order legalization of political
parties other than his own Democratic Party.
   The Ivory Coast constitution allows opposition, but those who

   In a message to the National Assembly, he promised political
reforms announced April 24 would proceed, but warned he would not

one-party state in 1968 and has been re-elected unopposed four
times, most recently in November 1986.
   Following a failed coup attempt in October 1989, and student
protests in January and February, his Gabon Progress Party pressed

to officials. At least 34 students were detained.
   The Bembas, Zambia's biggest tribe, wield most economic,
political and military power, but like other Zambians many have

<HEAD>Survey: Californians Don't Eat Enough Cancer-Fighting Fruits,
Veggies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN BRUNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The image of the health and diet
conscious Californian was debunked Tuesday by a new study that
shows two-thirds of state residents don't eat enough fruits and
vegetables.
   ``It's part of the myth of California,'' state Health Director
Kenneth Kizer said. ``People are just not aware of the link between
diet and cancer. If people make the link, their consumption of
fruits and vegetables does go up.
   ``(Now), they're eating too many Fruit Loops and not enough
fruit salads.'' With the produce section of a supermarket as a
backdrop, Kizer released the 1989 California Dietary Practices
Survey two years after the state launched a ``five servings a day''
educational program.
   Health officials say people should increase their consumption of
dietary fiber, which helps prevent cancer, by eating at least five
servings of fruits or vegetables each day.
   But the survey found that fewer than two out of three
Californians actually do so. One out of five doesn't eat any fruit
during an average day, the report found, and 27 percent eat no
vegetables.
   ``Californians are really not much better than the rest of the
nation when it comes to their diets,'' said Karen Bunch, director
of the survey research team. ``We do eat more fruit than the rest
of the nation, but not more vegetables.''
   Nationwide, 45 percent of Americans don't eat fruit or drink
juice during the day, and 22 percent don't eat vegetables or
salads, Ms. Bunch said.
   Californians also appear to be less informed than the rest of
the nation about the importance of eating fruits and vegetables as
part of a healthy diet, the survey found. Forty percent of
Californians surveyed said they don't believe that what a person
eats can affect their chances of getting cancer, compared to 33
percent in a nationwide survey in 1987.
   The report concluded that fruit and vegetable consumption
increased with education, income and knowledge about the link
between diet and health.
   ``Too many Californians are not aware of the link between diet
and cancer,'' Kizer said, adding that 150,000 Californians die each
year from diseases related to a poor diet. He said 35 percent of
cancers can be prevented by eating more fruits and vegetables, as
can 20 percent of heart diseases.
   Even when Californians do eat fruits and vegetables, they don't
show much imagination: their diets don't normally include some of
the more exotic varieties now available in supermarkets.
   Of those who eat fruits and vegetables, the No. 1 choice was
orange juice (28.3 percent) and green salad (28.6 percent), the
survey found.
   In order of popularity, the top 10 fruits consumed included
orange juice, bananas, apples, peaches, oranges, cantaloupes,
plums, watermelon, apple juice and nectarines.
   For vegetables, the top 10 list, in order of popularity,
included green salad, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, mixed
vegetables, corn, carrots, broccoli, green beans and onions.
   ``People are just not in the habit of eating right, and when
they do eat fruits and vegetables they eat the same things,'' Bunch
said. ``It took Kiwi fruit 10 years to catch on. There are so many
varieties out there. I mean, it's not like boring oat bran.''
   The telephone survey, conducted from May through September 1989,
randomly questioned 1,000 California residents about what they had
eaten during the previous 24 hours. The survey has a 3
percentage-point margin of error.

<HEAD>Nunn Plan Would Cut Military By 285,000 to Meet Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman,
facing demands for deeper cuts in defense than he has proposed, has
laid out an alternative that calls for a cut of 285,000 military
personnel, congressional sources said Tuesday.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., in closed-door sessions with members of
his panel, suggested the deep personnel cut to illustrate the
impact on the military from significant reductions in defense
spending.
   Nunn has argued the money would have to come from personnel and
readiness to meet budget cuts many Democrats have demanded, saying
the reductions couldn't come from major weapons systems where the
money is spent over several years.
   To meet the defense total of $294 billion approved by the Senate
Budget Committee and its chairman, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., Nunn
said the nation's armed forces that currently total 2.1 million
would have to be reduced by 285,000, said sources, who requested
anonymity.
   However, to meet Nunn's defense figure of $297 billion, the cut
in personnel would total 100,000, the sources said.
   If approved by the committee later this week, the full Senate
will then be forced to choose between Nunn's budget with its
smaller cut in personnel or the package based on Sasser's defense
total.
   The Senate is expected to consider the two bills just prior to
the August recess.
   The committee began crafting defense legislation for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1. The process has been delayed by the
inability of White House and congressional negotiators to agree on
how to reduce the federal budget deficit by $50 billion, and at the
same time decide on a 1991 defense total.
   Without a single figure for the military, Nunn decided that the
committee would draw up two bills _ one to his total and another to
the amount approved by the Senate Budget Committee.
   In the meetings with his panel, Nunn spelled out for lawmakers
how an additional $3 billion cut would result in nearly three times
the reduction in personnel, said the sources, who requested
anonymity.
   The panel is also weighing proposals that would slash President
Bush's $2.2 billion request for the program to place MX nuclear
missiles on railroad cars, said congressional sources.
   The plan currently before the Armed Services Committee calls for
$548 million in research and development money and elimination of
the $1.3 billion in procurement and $269 million in military
construction.
   Meanwhile in the House, where congressional sources say
committee action on the defense bill may be delayed until
September, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., met with the
panel's chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., to discuss whether the
budget summit would hold up work on the defense bill.
   Foley, in an interview with reporters, said he wants to see the
authorization bill completed before the August recess and prior to
defense appropriations legislation.

   Former three-term Gov. Arch A. Moore
Jr., convicted of corruption and characterized as remoreseless by
prosecutors, was sentenced Tuesday to five years and 10 months in
prison and fined $170,000.
   Moore, 67, pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud, extortion,
obstruction of justice and filing false income taxes during his
1984 and 1988 campaigns and during his third term, from 1985-89. He
lost the 1988 reelection bid.
   He was ordered to report to the Federal Correctional Institution
near Petersburg, Va., by July 31.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman on Monday had refused to let
Moore withdraw his guilty pleas.
   ``No governor or other public official of that responsibility
has ever been convicted for election fraud of this scope,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Savage said before sentencing.
   ``Arch Moore is a criminal,'' he said. ``If there is one thing
missing from that man, it's remorse.''
   Moore, a Republican who also was governor from 1969-1977, and a
U.S. congressman for 12 years, appeared stoic during the sentencing
and later declined comment. An appeal is pending, said defense
attorney William Hundley.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said Moore likely will serve at
least 2{ years before being considered for parole.
   ``I think it sends a very clear message,'' Carey said. ``If you
violate the public trust, you go to jail.''
   Carey's investigation into state government corruption also has
netted the convictions of five legislators, three lobbyists and a
state Senate aide.
   Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to extorting $573,000 from coal
operator H. Paul Kizer in return for a $2.1 million refund from the
state's Black Lung Fund, which provides benefits to coal miners.
   Moore also pleaded guilty to trying to block a federal grand
jury investigation into corruption in his administration.
   And he admitted filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985
and defrauding the state of his salary and benefits by funneling
$100,000 in illegal cash payments into his 1984 campaign, to buy
votes.
   Hoffman sentenced Moore to five years for extortion, six months
for mail fraud and two years each for the tax fraud charges, all
concurrent.
   Moore also got 10 months for the obstruction of justice charge,
which carries that mandatory prison term.
   Hundley said Moore's corruption involved campaign-funding
violations, not raids on the treasury, and added, ``I submit he
served well and honorably.''
   Moore is the second West Virginia governor to be convicted on
federal charges.
   W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, a Democrat who served from 1961-1965, was
convicted of bribing the foreman of a jury that acquitted him of
bribery in 1968. He served three years and four months of a 12-year
sentence.
   Moore was acquitted in 1976 of extorting $25,000 from a
financial holding company trying to get a state bank charter.
   Hoffman rejected a separate state petition seeking to recover $4
million from Moore because of his corruption, saying the petition
was filed too late. Before sentencing, Moore was subpoenaed by the

<HEAD>Official: Won't Allow U.S. Troops Ever to Operate in Colombia</HEAD>

   A government official said Tuesday that
Colombia will never allow U.S. troops to conduct anti-drug
operations on its territory, saying such ``Rambo-type actions''
were better suited for American cities.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono made his remarks in a radio
interview with the RCN network in response to an article in the
July 16 issue of Newsweek.
   The Newsweek article said the U.S. Southern Command, based in
Panama, was drawing up contingency plans for U.S. troops to play a
support role in a dramatic series of anti-drug strikes aimed at
crippling the cocaine cartels in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.
   However, the magazine said such raids were unlikely to happen
anytime soon _or possibly ever _ because of opposition in Congress
and the State Department's reluctance to offend Latin American
countries.
   Colombian news media interpreted the Newsweek article as
suggesting U.S. troops might be used in Colombia.
   But Londono said Colombia was opposed to any U.S. military
intervention, and said Washington could best assist in the drug war
by helping the local economy.
   ``... Where these Rambo-type actions are needed is in the big
North American cities where big distribution centers are found and
drugs are sold on street corners with the knowledge of American
authorities,'' Londono told RCN.
   ``If any (U.S.) aid is needed, it should be in the form of
paying fair prices for our export products and avoiding import
taxes on our agricultural and industrial products,'' he added.
   Newsweek said the military's contingency plans called for the
forces of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to attack local cartel
targets. While U.S. forces would not be used in actual strikes, all
the logistics, planning, training and support would be provided by
the Americans, the magazine said.
   The magazine, quoting an unidentified intelligence source, said
the Pentagon has plans to use U.S. special forces to capture
Colombian drug lords on orders from President Bush.
   Colombia has a deep-rooted sensitivity to a U.S. military
presence dating almost 90 years to the construction of the Panama
Canal.
   Panama was long a part of Colombia, but in 1903 the United
States backed a group of rebels who established a separate republic
and signed a treaty for construction of the canal.
   The U.S. government has repeatedly demonstrated over the years
that it understands Colombia's sensitivity about any U.S. military
role here.
   Last year, President Bush sent Bogota $65 million worth of
military aid for the anti-drug war.
   The U.S. military transport planes flying in the equipment
stayed only a few hours in Bogota, and the 150 American military
technicians spent a few days in Colombia to help set up the
equipment and train troops in its use.
   Even so, the Colombian news media ran several stories about the
presence of U.S. troops in the country at the time.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Injunction Blocking Learnfare in Milwaukee Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday suspended part of a
Wisconsin experiment that cuts the welfare benefits of families
whose children skip school, ruling that record-keeping errors have
resulted in cruel treatment.
   An recent audit of the program showed that some families were
being wrongly penalized because of poorly kept school attendance
records. A lawsuit against the program said one family was evicted
from its home and others had to turn to food pantries for food.
   U.S. District Judge Terence T. Evans ordered the suspension of
Learnfare in Milwaukee public schools at least until an improved
system of recording school absences in the state's largest city was
devised.
   ``It is an experiment with worthy goals of attempting to reduce
welfare dependency and provide incentives for children to stay in
school,'' Evans wrote in his ruling. But recipients of Aid to
Families with Dependent Children ``should not be made homeless and
hungry in the name of social experimentation,'' he said.
   Evans granted a preliminary injunction requested by the advocacy
group Legal Action of Wisconsin on behalf of six Milwaukee families
whose AFDC benefits were cut by Learnfare.
   The injunction applies only to the 3,200 teen-agers attending
Milwaukee Public Schools who have lost or are in danger of losing
AFDC benefits under Learnfare. State officials said the program
would continue elsewhere in the state.
   Learnfare, authorized by the Legislature in 1987, allows the
state to cut a family's monthly AFDC benefits if a school reports a
student has been consistently absent without excuse. Penalties
average about $100 a month for an average family receiving $517 a
month in benefits.
   The program applies to teen-agers, but Gov. Tommy G. Thompson
has received permission from the federal government to expand it to
include elementary school students.
   Thompson said late Tuesday the injunction was not a judgement of
the merits of Learnfare, but of administrative problems in
Milwaukee's public schools.
   ``There's no question Learnfare is a good program. It's
working,'' he said. ``What's wrong is .. some very poor record
keeping. I'm just happy the injunction was granted in the
summertime.''
   The Milwaukee lawsuit filed in December charged the program
violates the Social Security Act and the U.S. Constitution. It
named as defendants the state Department of Health and Social
Services and the Milwaukee County Department of Social Services.
   It cited problems with the administration of Learnfare,
especially attendance-keeping procedures in the Milwaukee Public
Schools, and the state's appeals hearing process.
   Evans said he would lift the injunction if the state and
Milwaukee County remedy their problems with monitoring school
absences.
   Legal Action attorney Patricia DeLessio said 1,600 to 2,000
Milwaukee students are sanctioned each month under the program.
   She said Evans' injunction did not address all of the legal
challenges of Learnfare pending in the courts.
   ``We focused on the immediate administrative problems which I
would describe as glaring,'' she said. ``It means welfare benefits
will not be cut any longer.''
   Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus, a Democrat who is challenging
Thompson in this fall's governor's race, predicted the injunction
would put a halt to Learnfare.
   ``I think it will stop it dead in its tracks for the foreseeable
future,'' Loftus said.

   The wife of FBI Director William S. Sessions
accompanied her husband on 17 official trips aboard government
aircraft but paid for only one flight, according to a report
released Tuesday.
   Alice Sessions accompanied her husband on a variety of business
trips from Washington to destinations including Key West, Fla.;
Williamsburg, Va.; San Francisco; and New Orleans, from Aug. 11,
1988 through July 31, 1989, said the report by the General
Accounting Office.
   While it didn't question the propriety of the trips, the
watchdog unit of Congress criticized the Justice Department for
failing to study the cost of using aircraft seized from convicted
criminals to transport Sessions and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   The GAO said it believed the department could save money by
leasing planes.
   FBI spokesman Robert Davenport said Mrs. Sessions did not
reimburse the agency for the trips because she was accompanying her
husband on official business.
   Davenport said Mrs. Sessions did pay the FBI $280 to cover one
leg of a trip that included a stopover in San Antonio, Texas, for
personal business.
   Sessions made 36 trips, generally to visit FBI field offices and
to make speeches to judicial and police groups. Thornburgh made 39
trips during the period aboard the government-owned aircraft,
mainly to give speeches and attend meetings.
   Five months after the GAO began its study, Thornburgh reimbursed
the Justice Department $2,128 for eight trips his wife took on the
government planes, the report said.
   The payment included $1,371 for six official trips that Mrs.
Thornburgh took during the 12-month period reviewed by GAO, the
report said. Thornburgh also repaid the government $1,032 in 1989
for personal trips he and his family members took aboard the
aircraft.
   Justice Department policy does not require Mrs. Thornburgh to
pay for trips on official flights ``if there is an empty seat and
the government would incur no extra cost,'' said department
spokesman Dan Eramian.
   ``Mrs. Thornburgh preferred, in the exercise of an abundance of
caution, to reimburse the government for the trips,'' Eramian said.
   In a letter to the Justice Department, Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va.,
criticized the agency for failure to adopt a travel policy,
particularly regarding ``issues such as what constitutes an
`official purpose' or `official function' and when non-official
passengers should be permitted to fly on government aircraft.''
   Wise, who asked for the report, said seven months have elapsed
since he was told a policy was being drafted.
   Eramian said a policy will be adopted, adding: ``It would have
been silly to put something together until we saw what the GAO
recommendations were.''
   The GAO study said the Justice Department failed to follow
government guidelines when comparing the cost of using government
aircraft seized from convicted criminals with the cost of using
leased planes to transport Thornburgh and Sessions.
   The Justice Department's own analysis, conducted after the GA0
began its study, showed that the government was saving $500,000 a
year to use the seized aircraft instead of leasing planes.
   ``If we had leased an aircraft and spent an extra half million a
year, we would have received a larger dose of criticism,'' Eramian
said.
   The GAO report noted concern for the security of both Thornburgh
and Sessions, quoting from a 1989 Justice Department memo stating
that the attorney general had been the subject of 13 threats during
his first six months in office.
   The report also noted that the FBI had received reports last
year that Thornburgh had been targeted by Colombian ``hit squads''
after Colombia resumed extraditing accused drug lords to this
country.

<HEAD>Budget Talks Resume With Goal of August Completion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   White House and congressional budget
negotiators resumed their closed-door talks on Tuesday with
bargainers hoping to complete a deal by Congress' August recess but
unsure they can do so.
   Separately, the Bush administration renewed its call for a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. A week before
the House is scheduled to vote on the proposal, Democrats predicted
they would defeat it.
   The budget talks, aimed at finding enough tax increases and
spending cuts to save at least $50 billion next year, had been on
hold since lawmakers began their Independence Day break on June 29.
   The negotiations got off to a slow start. Tuesday's morning
session was abbreviated because White House budget chief Richard
Darman testified at a House hearing on the balanced budget
amendment.
   At a lunch with Senate Republicans, Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan said that a multi-year deficit-reduction
package would help lower interest rates, participants said.
Proponents of serious cuts in the government's $150 billion annual
shortfalls have long argued that a major benefit would be lower
interest rates.
   Some participants in the talks fear that unless they shake hands
on a deal by the lawmakers' August break, Congress' budget work
could extend into an unusual post-election session. But bargainers
said they still had much work to do.
   ``I'd be very brave indeed if I told you we've approached a
number,'' said negotiator Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.
   Darman told the House Judiciary Committee's economic and
commercial law subcommittee that the administration supports
passage of a balanced budget amendment by the House. A vote is set
for next Tuesday.
   Darman argued that the costs of many federal programs are being
passed on to future generations in the form of government
borrowing, which must be repaid.
   ``Although the voters of the present are extremely
well-represented in our democratic system, the voters of the future
are not,'' he told the subcommittee.
   But panel Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, complained that the
amendment requires a balanced budget without addressing how to
achieve one.
   ``It's written in the words of Genesis, `Let there be a balanced
budget,''' said Brooks.
   No. 3 House Democratic leader Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.,
predicted that conservatives supporting the balanced budget measure
would fall short of the two-thirds vote needed for approval of a
proposed constitutional amendment.

   Police said they fired on a crowd of about 200
Palestinian protesters Tuesday near Shuafat refugee camp on the
northern outskirts of Jerusalem, killing one teen-ager and wounding
two.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the demonstrators blocked the
main road near the shantytown of about 8,000 Palestinians and began
hurling stones at passing vehicles.
   ``They then assaulted an outpost manned by three policemen who
fired tear gas, rubber bullets and finally live ammunition to drive
them back,'' he said.
   Doctors at Jerusalem's Mokassed Hospital said 16-year-old Mumzer
Zuhdi Musa Adabed was brought in dead with a gunshot wound in his
chest _ the 724th Palestinian killed by Israeli security forces or
civilians since the 31-month-long revolt began. Forty-four Israelis
have also been killed.
   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian identified as Salim
Salah Khuly, 24, was found stabbed and beaten to death near
Tulkarum. Residents said the victim was suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   The army confirmed the death but blamed the slaying on internal
strife between rival Palestinian clans.
   Since the revolt began in December 1987, at least 233
Palestinians, including Khuly, were killed by fellow Arabs, most as
suspected collaborators, drug dealers or prostitutes.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _The attorney general ordered police to press charges against
Israeli peace activist Abie Nathan for allegedly meeting with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization in violation of
Israeli law, Israel television said.
   _Doctors advised Foreign Minister David Levy to delay his
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Paris
next week pending an improvement in his health. Levy, 52, underwent
surgery following a mild heart attack last month.
   Baker has sought for months to arrange Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, but his efforts have been deadlocked by Israel's
insistence on excluding the PLO from talks. Israel views the PLO as
a terrorist group.
   _Police announced the arrest of Israelis Eli Vanunu, 33, and Nir
Ephroni, 27, for the 1984 murder of Omar Ahamad Uda, an Arab gas
station attendant. They said the killing apparently was to avenge
the death of an Israeli female soldier, believed killed by
Palestinian nationalists.
   An informed Israeli source meanwhile said Israel supplied
intelligence information to Washington indicating that an elite
military unit within the PLO was behind the May 28 bombing at a
Jerusalem vegetable market that killed one Israeli and wounded nine.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh declined comment and
officials in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office said they knew
of no such information.
   The bombing came two days prior to a failed speedboat attack on
Israeli beaches by a splinter PLO faction.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat refused to condemn that raid, leading
to suspension of the 18-month-old U.S.-PLO dialogue, launched after
Arafat renounced terrorism.
   The Israeli source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
bombing was the action of Force 17, a military unit set up by
Arafat. The source said this information was passed on to the
United States and likely played a role in President Bush's decision
to cut off the U.S.-PLO dialogue.

   Here are some quotes from the Soviet Communist Party Congress
held Tuesday in Moscow.
   
   ``I maintain only one thing: The policy that I have chosen I
will pursue, and for me the biggest prize is that my homeland will
live.'' _ Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   
   ``It is an illusion to think that after all dissenters, all who
do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus, quit the
party, it will retain all the property of the Soviet Communist
Party and the associated authority. It will not be so. ... The
party will be bankrupt, obliged to repay its debts to the people,
if only with its property.'' _ Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the
Russian Federation.
   
   ``I don't see another force other than the party which could
bring progress to our country.'' _ hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev
   
   ``Our Russian thirst for blood is showing. It's stupid and ugly
and inhuman.'' - Inna Dementyeva, a Moscow delegate.
   
   
   ``You can never go back to yesterday by any path, and no
dictatorship ... solves anything. If any of the delegates came to
the congress with the hope of returning the party to old
conditions, comfortable or uncomfortable, this is not a question,
they were seriously mistaken.'' _ Gorbachev.

   Police perusing demonology books as they prepare
for a feared attack Thursday by the Zodiac gunman say he may have
learned some of his victims' birthdays from Census data or Social
Security forms.
   All four of the shootings by the gunman so far have been in the
early morning hours on a Thursday. The last one came three weeks
ago Thursday, and the previous spacing of the attacks has led
police to focus on this Thursday.
   ``Tomorrow night is a target night,'' Police Department
spokeswoman Suzanne Trazoff said Tuesday.
   All of the gunman's victims were defenseless at the time they
were shot. Two walked with canes; one was inebriated; one was a
homeless man sleeping on a Central Park bench. Three victims
survived the attacks; a fourth died.
   He has promised in letters to police, the New York Post and CBS
to kill 12 people, one for each sign of the zodiac. His four
victims, all men, have been a Scorpio, a Gemini, a Taurus and a
Cancer.
   The gunman scrawled the symbols for his victims' astrological
signs on each of the letters he mailed after the attacks.
   Increased police patrols were scheduled citywide to try to stop
the gunman from stalking his fifth victim.
   ``We feel that there is some significance with tomorrow night
and the police department will be taking precautions and certain
measures,'' said Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli.
   The astrological pattern of the shootings has police searching
through books on astrology and demonology. Authorities also have
consulted experts in the occult.
   The homeless man, 30-year-old Larry Parham, who was the most
recent victim, recalled telling a stranger his birth date two days
before he was shot June 21, Borrelli said.
   The other two surviving victims couldn't recall being asked
their birthdays by strangers.
   Police said the gunman may have gotten access to the birthdays
any place where applications are filled out, such as bank tellers'
windows or government offices. Borrelli also raised the possibility
the gunman might have gotten information from Census takers.
   More than 50 suspects were questioned and eliminated so far
during the investigation, Borrelli said.
   ``I can't tell you that we're now close to a ... a bona fide,
legitimate suspect yet,'' the detective chief added.
   Trazoff refused to discuss specifics of the increased patrols or
to comment on which part of the city has been targeted by the
50-detective Zodiac Task Force as the site of a fifth shooting.
   ``Obviously, to tip our hand would be counterproductive,'' she
said.
   Psychological profiles of the victims have been run through an
FBI computer, descriptions from two people have produced sketches
of the gunman, and some 1,800 calls have been made to a 24-hour hot
line.
   Still, detectives remain unsure how the gunman knows his
victims' astrological signs.
   The gunman, who claimed to be the same ``Zodiac'' who terrorized
San Francisco during the late 1960's and early '70s, is believed to
have gotten his ideas from a 1986 book called ``Zodiac,'' which
details the San Francisco killings.
   But the New York gunman, who began his six letters to the media
with the same phrase used in letters by the San Francisco gunman _
``This is the Zodiac'' _ was not believed to be the same man.
   Author Robert Graysmith tells of how the San Francisco killer
stalked mostly young couples, attacking them near bodies of water,
mostly on Saturday nights during a full moon.
   A man who called himself the Zodiac sent letters to local
newspapers claiming responsibility for as many as 37 killings and
taunting the police to catch him.
   Despite an intense manhunt in the Bay area, the San Francisco
Zodiac was never captured.

<HEAD>Bosch Rejects Offer for House Arrest Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Militant Cuban exile Orlando Bosch rejected the
restrictive conditions the government had placed on an offer to end
his 14 years in prison, and federal officials said Tuesday the
terms were non-negotiable.
   The government had proposed a restrictive house-arrest program
that would allow officials to monitor Bosch's telephone
conversations and require him to log the name and address of
visitors.
   ``He's willing to agree to all of the conditions except that
one,'' said Bosch's daughter, Myriam Bosch. ``It's a matter of
dignity. He's not going to be an informant. The FBI can do their
own work.''
   Ms. Bosch said her father notified his attorneys of his
decision, and they contacted immigration officials.
   Bosch has become a cause celebre for Miami's staunchly
anti-Castro Cuban exile community, which has held rallies and
demonstrations on his behalf attended by leading politicians.
   Bosch spent 11 years in a Venezuelan prison for allegedly
masterminding the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed all
73 people aboard. In 1968, he was convicted in a rocket attack on a
Polish freighter in Miami and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian acknowledged that a
lawyer for Bosch had a ``number of questions'' about the terms of
the proposed parole.
   ``I see very little room to wiggle,'' Eramian said. ``If he has
questions, we will be happy to explain the conditions to him.''
   Another source with the Justice Department said the government
will not negotiate the offer.
   ``Bosch won't accept the conditions, and he won't be released
unless he does,'' the source told The Associated Press.
   George Yoss, an attorney for Bosch, said he expected discussions
with federal officials in Washington to continue Wednesday.
   Bosch's family criticized the two-page list of conditions for
the release of the 63-year-old former pediatrician, who suffers
from declining health after years in Venezuelan and U.S. jails.
   The conditions would require Bosch to wear an electronic
monitoring device, remain at home for 21 hours a day and allow his
telephone to be monitored.
   Bosch also would be subject to unannounced searches and lie
detector tests, and if instructed, must present himself for
deportation within 72 hours.
   Bosch has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
south of Miami since 1988, when he was arrested for parole
violations and for re-entering the country illegally.

<HEAD>Suit Says Lessons Have Anti-Minority Slant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal suit filed Tuesday on behalf of eight
black children claims they are victimized by a school system that
teaches minority pupils they are inferior to whites.
   The class-action suit filed in U.S. District Court asks the
court to find New York City's curriculum racially discriminatory,
said Joseph Fleming, lawyer for the eight children.
   The defendants are U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos,
New York State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol, New York City
Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez and the city, state and federal
boards or departments of education.
   Children suffer irreparable damage from a ``curriculum of
exclusion'' that ``literally teaches that people of African, Latino
and Asian descent have made no significant contribution to the
development of civilization,'' said Bob Law, a radio talk show host
who helped organize the lawsuit.
   Even at its most benign, the schools' ``Euro-centric bias''
sends negative signals to nonwhite children, for example referring
to Duke Ellington as a ``bandleader'' but Leonard Bernstein as a
``maestro'' or ``orchestra conductor,'' Law said.
   The lawsuit demands the school system adopt ``a multicultural
curriculum which includes the existence, true participation and
contributions of African Americans and other nonwhites in world and
American culture, sciences, history, arts and other areas of human
endeavor.''
   David Powell, father of plaintiffs Rashida, 13, and Hasani, 9,
said Hasani ``doesn't like history because he says he doesn't see
himself there, only white people.''
   Law told a news conference the suit was filed because Sobol is
stalling on implementing recommendations of his own task force,
which advocated a multicultural approach to education in a report
last year.
   Sobol accepted the task force findings but backed off in the
face of ``high-profile resistance'' from two professionals asked to
review the report, Law said. They were Diane Ravitch, a professor
at Columbia University's Teachers College, and historian Arthur
Schlesinger, a professor at City University.
   Law said Ravitch called the suggested reforms ``ethnic
cheerleading.''
   Law, whose night talk show is broadcast on stations around the
country, used it to help get plaintiffs to come forward.
   The eight children, ages 8 to 14, attend public schools in the
boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens.
   Schlesinger, called for comment, said, ``I'm sympathetic to the
purposes behind the suit, but I don't think this is the way to go
about organizing a curriculum.''
   Ravitch's secretary said she could not immediately be reached.
   Chris Carpenter, spokesman for the state Education Department in
Albany, said Sobol and the Board of Regents agree with the task

<HEAD>Radio Shack Dealer To Stand Trial for Videotaping Employees Having
Sex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLEGAN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Radio Shack dealer on Tuesday was
ordered to stand trial for inviting his teen-age employees to have
sex with their boyfriends in the back room of his store and
videotaping their activities.
   Howard R. DeYoung, who operates the electronics store in Dorr,
15 miles south of Grand Rapids, allegedly made the room available
after work to female workers, who were minors, said Detective Rick
Cain of the Allegan County Sheriff's Department.
   He provided them with sexual aids, pornographic magazines and
alcohol, Cain said.
   DeYoung, 38, allegedly used electronic surveillance equipment to
make sexually explicit photographs, videotapes and audio recordings
of as many as 20 area teens who used the room over the last 2{
years, Cain said.
   DeYoung was ordered to stand trial on three charges of child
abusive commercial activity, a felony punishable by up to 20 years
in prison, and three counts of electronic eavesdropping, punishable
by two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   Defense lawyer Larry Woods has maintained DeYoung's innocence.
He is scheduled to be arraigned in Circuit Court Friday.
   It's not alleged that DeYoung sold or distributed the tapes.
   Three former female employees testified Tuesday they had no idea
their activities were being recorded.
   ``He told us that we could go in there to be alone,'' one said.
The three women all are now older than 18.
   They testified that DeYoung invited them to use the room after
hours and provided keys to the store. The room was equipped with
sofa bed, a large-screen television with a satellite dish that
received pornographic stations and videocassette recorder, the
women testified.
   Though not all of the three cameras in the room were hidden,
DeYoung told the women that the surveillance camera was not
working. The cameras, all aimed at the bed, were set up to activate
when the room's door was opened, Cain said.
   Search warrants for DeYoung's home were issued last month after
one of the women found tapes marked with employees' names. She
played one with her name on it and turned it over to police.
   ``These girls are devastated,'' Cain said. ``They always thought
he was being a nice person.''

   A Tehran-born restaurateur said Tuesday that
he repeatedly smoked opium with Marion Barry but warned the mayor
that he should ``slow down'' and be cautious in his drug use.
   Appearing for a second day at Barry's drug and perjury trial,
Hassan Mohammadi also testified that the mayor snorted cocaine
several times in his own home. He said Barry started snorting
cocaine on boats after the mayor's hotel room visits became the
focus of a police drug probe in December 1988.
   Barry's defense team depicted Mohammadi in cross-examination as
a man willing to say anything to avoid being deported to Iran. The
witness admitted that he has been placed on a ``blacklist'' by the
current regime in Iran because he had worked for the Iranian
government before the Shah was overthrown.
   ``I was a true friend for Mr. Mayor,'' Mohammadi told the court.
He said he warned Barry, ``You just have to slow down and you have
to know who you are dealing with,'' at the time police were
investigating Barry's visits to the room of Charles Lewis at the
Ramada Inn in Washington.
   Lewis later pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to deal
cocaine.
   ``I would tell him, `Mr. Mayor, enough is enough,''' said
Mohammadi.
   ``He said he is not going to go to any more hotels,'' Mohammadi
said Barry told him.
   While the criminal investigation was going on, Barry had
Mohammadi start meeting him on boats.
   Barry and a female companion snorted cocaine in February 1989
aboard a pleasure boat moored at a marina, said Mohammadi. Later,
in the summer, Barry had Mohammadi again meet him on a boat, where
the mayor snorted some lines of cocaine in the bathroom, said the
restaurateur.
   Mohammadi testified that a woman he knew as ``Miss T'' was
frequently Barry's female companion when drugs were being used. In
one incident, Miss T wasn't interested in taking opium and so she
snorted cocaine instead, said Mohammadi.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued a bench
warrant for the woman, Theresa Southerland, when she failed to
appear in court due to a scheduling mixup with Southerland's
lawyer. Jackson told the jury she would be in court Wednesday.
   On hand for Tuesday's session, was comedian-activist Dick
Gregory, who attended the trial as Barry's guest.
   Barry is allowed four guest seats in the courtroom and has
invited other high-profile blacks, including Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan and Rev. George Stallings, a breakaway Catholic
priest.
   Mohammadi has testified that he furnished drugs to Barry at
least 30 times and that the mayor never paid for them. Mohammadi
said he told Barry repeatedly that ``I am not looking for any
favors.''
   Mohammadi, who immigrated from Iran in 1972, met Barry at a
District of Columbia party at the Democratic National Convention in
San Francisco in 1984.
   Mohammadi lied to police in February 1989 by denying that the
mayor was involved with drugs, the restaurateur testified.
Mohammadi then reported back to Barry on what questions the police
had asked.
   ``I covered wherever I could,'' said Mohammadi.
   ``I was a true friend for Mr. Mayor; I was always there for Mr.
Mayor,'' he testified.
   The restaurateur said he started cooperating with the government
after Barry was arrested Jan. 18 in an FBI sting because
``everybody came from the woodwork. I did not have any choice.''
Others had implicated the restaurateur, Mohammadi said.
   Mohammadi testified that he and the mayor smoked opium by
putting the drug on the back of a spoon and warming it up with the
flame from a plumber's torch.
   They inhaled through a straw and part of a coat hanger in order
to ``get the maximum smoke out of it,'' Mohammadi said. The two
first used opium together in February 1988 at Mohammadi's
apartment, he testified.
   At the mayor's urging, Mohammadi one time pulled the opium-laden
spoon out of his car and they smoked the residue, the restaurateur
testified.
   In July 1989 during a crab feast at Barry's house, the mayor
asked ``if I had anything.'' Mohammadi said he did.
   The two went upstairs in Barry's home and ``we did some lines''
of cocaine in the bathroom next to the main bedroom, said
Mohammadi. The mayor used cocaine on several other occasions at his
home, including last November just before Thanksgiving, Mohammadi
said.

   Stone-throwing mobs battled riot police in
rural areas Tuesday, and President Daniel arap Moi blamed the
anti-government riots on ``hooligans and drug addicts.'' Eighteen
have died in four days of violence.
   The State Department said in Washington Tuesday it was advising
American citizens to delay all non-essential travel to Kenya
because of the unrest.
   Nairobi, the scene of widespread violence over the weekend,
appeared calm.
   The violence followed last week's detentions of Kenya's most
prominent supporters of political pluralism. Five of them were
detained under public securit statutes that allow them to be held
without charge indefinitely.
   One opposition politician held was Kenneth Matiba. His daughter,
Susan, said in an interview in Kenya on Britain's Channel 4 TV News
Tuesday night:
   ``There is widespread discontent in the country. ... The economy
is very depressed. ... There is a widespread feeling that
mismanagement and corruption in the government have gone beyond any
acceptable level. People have been unable to express their opinion
in any way.''
   The program said Ms. Matiba and her mother were beaten up when
their house was broken into on June 13. It did not say where in
Kenya she interviewed.
   Kenya, a one-party state, has long been considered one of
Africa's most stable and successful nations. Since early this year,
however, Moi has come under increasing pressure to allow a
multiparty system.
   Clashes between mobs and security forces were reported Tuesday
in and around the towns of Kiambu, Nyeri and Githunguri, all north
of Nairobi, where riot troops fired on suspected demonstrators.
   Violence also was reported in Kangemi and Kawangware, low-income
neighborhoods on Nairobi's western edge, where security forces beat
people indiscriminately, according to residents.
   Some residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were beaten by police, who then robbed them of money and valuables.
   A spokesman for Moi's office said 15 people had been killed and
61 wounded in the disturbances, which began Saturday when police
used tear gas and guns to halt a pro-democracy rally.
   At least three of 10 deaths confirmed independently were not
included in the government breakdown. The government did not
identify those killed, and it was not immediately clear if the
other seven deaths confirmed independently were in the official
figure.
   Moi, in comments to Kenyan troops back from U.N. peacekeeping
duty in Namibia, blamed the riots on ``hooligans and drug addicts''
and said his government would continue hunting down instigators of
the violence.
   The comments, his first public mention of the violence, followed
a government order Monday empowering police to use whatever force
necessary to quell the disturbances.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying
the recent demonstrations, accompanied by looting and clashes
between police and rioters, have made conditions unsafe for
travelers.
   The Kenyan Embassy in Washington responded with a statement
Tuesday expressing understanding for U.S. concerns and offering
reassurances that the government would do everything possible to
ensure the safety of Americans in Kenya.
   It said the situation in Kenya was returning to normal
``following a few isolated incidents by looters and hooligans.''
   ``We are confident that the United States will reappraise and
remove its temporary advisory,'' the embassy statement said.
   ``The government of Kenya is confident that the good, friendly
relationship that exists between the Republic of Kenya and the
United States of America will contribute to the quick and
expeditious resolution of this matter.''
   Moi says that because there are about 40 tribes in Kenya, a
multiparty system would result in tribal-based parties leading to
ethnic divisions and even tribal
   One prominent lawyer under threat of arrest for his criticism of
the government, Paul Muite, has gone into hiding. Another, human
rights lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria, has sought refuge at the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi.
   On Monday, Kenya condemned the U.S. decision to give Kuria
asylum, and also accused the United States of fueling the
pro-democracy movement and interfering in internal affairs.
   The United States protested the charge in a meeting in
Washington Monday between the assistant secretary for African
affairs, Herman Cohen, and Kenya's ambassador in Washington, Denis
Afande.
   Tuesday morning, two large artillery guns were parked across the
street from the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   By noon, the guns had been removed.

   Security forces opened fire on a crowd at
a soccer game in Somalia after ``provocateurs'' began stoning the
president, a Somali official said Tuesday. Diplomatic sources said
at least 65 people were killed, but the Somali government said only
three people died.
   Unofficial fatality estimates in Friday's shootings in
Mogadishu, the Somali capital, range as high as 109, according to
one diplomatic source, who said 65 people were confirmed dead at
the city's Digfer Hospital.
   More than 100 people were seriously injured, another source said.
   But Abbudllahi Farah Barre, first secretary at the Somali
Embassy in Rome, insisted only three people were killed in the
stadium shooting. He said he did not have exact figures on the
number of injured.
   He said security forces opened fire after ``some provocateurs''
began throwing rocks at President Mohammed Siad Barre. He said the
security forces first fired in the air, then on the crowd as it
continued to throw rocks and began to pelt security officers.
   On Saturday, the Somali Ministry of Labor, Sports and Social
Affairs dismissed the incident as a ``chance accident'' and said it
had sent condolences to the victims' families. It also said three
people were killed.
   The ministry blamed the incident on crowding and said people had
been hit by bullets when security forces fired ``high into the
air'' to maintain peace.
   International telephone connections to Somalia were not working
Tuesday and it was not immediately possible to contact anyone in
Mogadishu.
   Somalia is an impoverished nation on the Horn of Africa. In
recent years, the government steadily has lost control of much of
the nation's countryside to insurgencies and warring clans.
   Siad Barre has ruled the predominantly Moslem nation since
seizing power in a coup in 1969.

   A spokeswoman for Switzerland's refugee
agency said Tuesday that Mihai Lupoi, 37, a former tourism minister
in Romania's post-revolution government, has asked for political
asylum.
   He applied last Thursday, she said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Lupoi gained prominence when he declared that the army was on
the side of the Romanian people during the December uprising that
ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Ceausescu was executed on Dec.
25 along with his wife, Elena.
   Lupoi was appointed tourism minister in Ion Iliescu's National
Salvation Front government.
   The French-language newspaper Tribune de Geneve said he stepped
down in February and fled Romania after he was accused of helping
to organize anti-government demonstrations.
   It said shots were recently fired at Lupoi's vehicle.
   The paper said Lupoi and his wife, Magdalena, arrived in
Switzerland last Wednesday. Their 1-year-old son was not with them,
it reported.

   Leaders of two opposition parties
demanded on Tuesday that President Mobutu Sese Seko resign and make
way for the introduction of a multiparty democracy.
   The demand came as a pay strike by government employees
paralyzed most public services in the capital.
   ``Like the colonial dicatorship, the Mobutu dictatorship should
pack up its bags and disappear forever,'' read a statement by
leaders of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress. The party
said Zaireans should use every legal means to drive Mobutu out.
   The Unified Lumumbiste Party said it was determined to force
Mobutu to leave.
   Nguz Karl I Bond, a former foreign minister who formed a third
opposition party, the Republican Independents, said a national
conference should be held to discuss the transition to democracy.
He said the conference also could select a transitional government.
   Mobutu was accused of delay after promising to permit opposition
parties and to guide this former Belgian colony toward multiparty
rule. His security forces were accused of attacking student critics
of his regime.
   Belgium froze new aid to Zaire after security forces were
accused of killing 50 to 150 students in the copper region capital
of Lubumbashi.
   An inquiry by Parliament, controlled by Mobutu's Popular
Movement for the Revolution, found the Lubumbashi region governor
and other high officials responsible for the student killings.
Mobutu said they will be brought to justice, but refused to allow
an international investigation.
   Mobutu said last week that Zaireans will vote in January to
choose which three parties will be permitted to contest elections
next year.
   Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, gained independence in 1960.
The central African nation has a population of more than 32.5
million.

<HEAD>Neil Bush Denies Wrongdoing as Silverado Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil, a former director of
the failed Silverado Savings and Loan, said Tuesday he and the
thrift were victimized ``by a system that was doomed to fail, has
failed, and will continue to fail.''
   Bush, who served as a director from 1985 to August 1988, was
interviewed before being advised the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. was gearing up to file a lawsuit charging that he and other
directors acted improperly as board members.
   ABC News reported Tuesday night that the federal government's
lawsuit will claim Silverado's losses were due in part to
negligence on the part of Bush and others. The suit will claim the
directors did not act responsibly when they approved dozens of
questionable loans, ABC reported.
   Bush told ABC he was not aware of the pending lawsuit.
   But he told The Associated Press he had performed properly, and
that all loans that came before the directors were for projects
previously approved by others more knowledgeable than he.
   Bush said the Silverado case was insignificant compared to
abuses found elsewhere in the nation's thrift disaster, which is
expected to cost taxpayers more than $300 billion. The Silverado
failure is expected to cost $1 billion in tax money.
   He said thrift regulators from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Topeka, Kan., who approved the loans that contributed to
Silverado's failure, are trying to blame him for the thrift's
collapse.
   ``It's self-serving. The regulators are politically motivated,''
he said.
   Bush said what angers him ``as a taxpayer and a citizen is that
there's a system out there that, in retrospect, was doomed to fail
... that the federal government insured deposits up to $100,000 and
made our financial service industry a socialized industry,
guaranteeing the business activities of S&amp;Ls.''
   With deregulation, he said, many in the S&amp;L industry tried to
grow out of problems and were doomed to fail.
   ``And it has failed, and it will continue to fail,'' he said.
``The only winners are the large corporations that end up buying
these organizations for incredible terms.''
   ``The taxpayers are the ones getting screwed in this process,''
he said. ``They are angry _ and they should be angry.''
   Bush said he might have been apprehensive, if not doubtful,
about certain loans approved by Silverado management if it weren't
for several factors:
   ``One, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board had approved the
structure of the loans and the deals that were made that are now
being questioned by the same self-serving bureaucrats who are
trying to make the case against Silverado.
   ``Second, we had legal counsel look at every deal and
transaction to see that it fell within the regulatory rules that
existed, and thirdly we had accountants every year sign off and
give Silverado a clean bill of health. At every step of the way we
had good advice,'' he said.
   ``Unfortunately, in an economy that absolutely collapsed, it
didn't matter how good the appraisal was in 1985.''
   Bush said, ``Every institution that had a greater than 25
percent concentrate in real estate assets in its portfolio has
failed in Denver.''
   During his time as a Silverado director, he said, ``every
investment made was thoroughly reviewed by (Silverado's) staff. I
was an outside director and showed up once a month.''
   Moreover, he said, the board made some modifications and
approved most loans unanimously.

<TEXT>
   Walter Leroy Moody Jr., the target of a
federal probe into two fatal mail bombings by an avowed racist, was
arrested Tuesday with his wife on apparently unrelated charges.
   A spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's office said Moody and Susan
McBride Moody were charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice,
subordination of perjury, bribery of a witness and tampering with a
witness.
   The Moodys' home in Rex, Ga., was thoroughly searched last year
by federal agents investigating a series of mail bombings,
including two that killed a federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., and
a civil rights lawyer in Savannah. Letters that claimed
responsibility for the bombings attributed them to a racist hate
group.
   Bruce Harvey, a lawyer representing Moody, said Tuesday's
charges were not related to the bombing investigation.
   The Moodys were charged with trying to illegally induce the
federal court in Macon to issue a writ of error that would vacate
Moody's 1972 federal conviction for unlawful possession of a pipe
bomb.
   Moody, 56 a self-employed literary consultant, was convicted in
1972 after a pipe bomb went off in his home, injuring his
then-wife, Hazel. Moody spent two years in federal prison.
   Tuesday's indictment said the Moodys persuaded witnesses to sign
false declarations and give false testimony to vacate the charges
in hearings at the U.S. District Court in Macon.
   The witnesses, Julie Linn West and her mother, Joanne Ekstrom,
of Atlanta, provided an alibi for Moody by saying they knew the
Macon bomb was planted by someone other than he.
   The two women were relocated by the government in April after
Miss West recanted her testimony and claimed that Moody paid her to
lie in court proceedings, according to the Atlanta Constitution.
   The indictment said it covers activities during the period from
1986 to 1988 as well as February and March of this year. The search
of the Moodys' home took place in February.
   Prosecutors claimed at the time of his conviction that Moody
planned to send the pipe bomb to an Atlanta auto dealer who had
repossessed his car.
   If convicted, Moody could be sentenced to up to 69 years in
prison and face fines of up to $1.2 million. Mrs. Moody, 28, faces
up to 64 years in prison.

<HEAD>Drug Testing Upheld for 538,000 Airline Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the
random drug testing of an estimated 538,000 airline employees and
air traffic controllers, saying public safety needs outweighed the
employees' privacy rights.
   The ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is one of
several appellate decisions in the last year allowing random
testing in safety-related and other sensitive jobs.
   The Supreme Court has denied hearings to employee groups
appealing the earlier rulings, and has not yet ruled itself in a
random drug-testing case. But the high court's decision last year
upholding drug testing of Customs Service employees seeking
promotions to certain jobs that involve drug enforcement or guns
was the basis of Tuesday's appellate ruling.
   ``The government interest in preventing drug use by persons
holding safety-sensitive positions in the aviation industry is at
least as compelling as the interest in preventing drug use by
Customs officers,'' wrote Judge William Norris in the 3-0 decision.
   He also said the Federal Aviation Administration provided
evidence of some drug use by commercial airline employees,
including treatment of a number of flight crew members for cocaine
overdoses or addiction and the presence of drugs in the bodies of
two pilots after crashes. No similar evidence was offered by
Customs officials, who justified their testing program as a
deterrent to future drug use, Norris said.
   Bob Marx, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation,
said the department was particularly pleased with the ruling
because two other major drug-testing cases, involving truckers and
pipeline workers, are are before the 9th Circuit.
   ``We consider random drug testing to be most effective way of
keeping the transportation industry drug-free,'' Marx said.
   The FAA's program, implemented at the end of 1988, requires
random urine testing of at least half the employees each year in
safety-related jobs in commercial aviation. They include pilots,
flight attendants, instructors, flight testers, aircraft
dispatchers, maintenance crews, security personnel and air traffic
controllers.
   Employees who test positive for illegal drugs after a confirming
retest and medical review are removed from their jobs. The tests
are conducted without advance warning.
   Other drug-testing programs involving the same employees,
including pre-employment testing and testing based on reasonable
suspicion of current drug use, were not challenged in the lawsuit.
   The suit by employee unions did not dispute that most of the
jobs were safety-related but argued that unannounced, random
testing, without individual suspicion of drug impairment, intruded
unnecessarily on employees' right to privacy.
   The constitutional ban on unreasonable searches ``requires that
the government not be able to conduct suspicionless searches on
people who are basically presumed to be guilty of no wrongdoing,
beyond those searches that can be fairly characterized as minimally
intrusive,'' such as highway checkpoints, said Walter Kamiat, a
lawyer for the unions.
   ``The fact that somebody's safety-sensitive doesn't justify
anything that the state wants to do to them. ... The issue is, what
is the test and how intrusive (is it) into their privacy, sense of
dignity?''
   The court agreed that the fact that the drug testing was random
and unannounced made it more intrusive, but said it was not enough
to outweigh the government interest in an effective testing program
for safety-related employees.

   A thorough study of Soviet economic needs, as
proposed Tuesday at the Houston economic summit, would take longer
than foreseen by the summit leaders, the World Bank said.
   In a decision that eased a dispute over whether to provide
emergency aid quickly to Moscow, the seven summit countries said a
group of international financial institutions, including the World
Bank, would study Soviet economic requirements.
   They said the study, to be supervised by the International
Monetary Fund, is to be finished by year's end, officials at the
summit said.
   The World Bank, however, said a meaningful study would take more
time.
   ``A study of this nature would take a long time _ a year or so _
and could provide a useful basis for countries considering
providing investment capital,'' it said.
   The bank also said that because the Soviet Union is not among
its 151 members, the bank's directors in Washington would have to
approve the bank's participation in the study.
   France, Italy and West Germany have pushed during the Houston
summit for a joint Western package of financial aid to Moscow. They
say that to wait would risk ending all momentum toward democractic
reform in the communist country.
   The United States, backed by Japan, argues that Moscow should
make more economic and political reforms before it gets Western
cash. The U.S. delegation pushed for Western technical assistance
that would not include cash or financial credits.
   As part of a technical aid program already under way, the United
States has sent central bank officials and other financial experts
to Moscow to advise Soviet government officials on ways of
developing a banking system and other capitalist institutions.
   Soviet officials also have come to Washington to consult on
technical economic matters.
   In addition, if the Soviets drop barriers to emigration, the
United States could waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment, thereby
permitting normal trade between the two countries.
   That step, in turn, could be followed by U.S. trade credits and
the easing of high technology exports. The Soviets may act on the
emigration question in September.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev set in
motion this type of cooperation at the summit in Malta last
December.
   Ed A. Hewitt of the Brookings Institution, a think tank, said
U.S. experts could aid the Soviets in overcoming such problems as
getting food to the market place. About a third of all Soviet food
rots before reaching the dinner table because of inadequate
transportation or storage facilities, he said.
   Both Hewitt and Richard Feinberg, vice president of the Overseas
Development Council, strongly support a major role for the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund in helping the Soviets.
   Financial stabilization and structural changes are sorely needed
in the Soviet Union and are precisely the areas the bank and the
fund have been set up to deal with, Feinberg said.
   The Soviets have indicated a desire to join the two
Washington-based institutions. The United States traditionally has
opposed Soviet membership but officials said the U.S. position may
be reassessed.

   Scottish adventurer Tom McClean says he has
rowed and sailed across the Atlantic Ocean four times, but the
voyage he began Tuesday is unique: this time his boat is a bottle.
   McClean, 47, came up with the gimmick to raise $800,000 for the
National Children's Homes, an organization that cares for 11,000
orphans in Britain.
   ``I thought it'd be a good idea to have a message in a bottle,''
said McClean, an orphan himself from age 2, just before pushing off
at 12:46 p.m. from a West Side pier.
   He expects to bob his way to Falmouth, England, in about 28 days.
   The 37-foot steel bottle has a diesel engine with a top speed of
about four knots, a little faster if the sail is up, McClean said.
   An automatic pilot will steer the bottle, which was built by a
friend. McClean will be traveling alone _ no mother boat _ but will
be in contact via radio with a team on shore and his family in Fort
William, Scotland.
   ``The most difficult thing is the first week, just getting used
to it, and especially if you have bad weather,'' he said.
   Should he encounter any storms, ``then you throttle back and
have a sleep'' in the four-poster bed onboard, he said.
   McLean also has navigation books and adventure stories to keep
himself amused and small projects to work on.
   The trip is sponsored by the British Ty-phoo Tea Co.
   McClean set a world record for rowing across the Atlantic in 54}
days in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said
Tuesday he is still hopeful teacher Brian Keenan will soon be freed
by his Lebanese kidnappers.
   After Iran's official news agency said Saturday that a European
will likely be freed soon, a source close to the Syrian army
command said it would probably be the 39-year-old Belfast-born
teacher, who holds Irish and British citizenship.
   Haughey told the Dail, or Parliament, that his government was
making ``appropriate preparations'' in the event of Keenan's
release but he had no new information.
   In Belfast, Keenan's sisters, Elaine Spence and Brenda Gillham,
have their bags packed to fly to Damascus, the Syrian capital, if
there is any confirmation of his release.
   ``Everything looks good but we could still be terribly
disappointed as we have been before and we have to try somehow to
prepare ourselves for that. It could change so quickly,'' said Mrs.
Gillham, who was celebrating her 47th birthday.
   ``If it wasn't Brian I would naturally be disappointed but still
happy if someone came out. It would be a mixture of tears and joy.
In any case, if someone is released it would be one step towards
Brian being free,'' she said.
   Iran is reported to be pushing hard for the release of a hostage
in appreciation for aid it received after the June 21 killer
earthquake. The Irish Red Cross flew the first Western relief plane
into Tehran after the devastating earthquake that killed 40,000
people.
   Three Irish parliamentarians visited Tehran shortly before the
quake and held talks about Keenan with Foreign Ministry officials.
On their return to Dublin, they condemned the imprisonment of more
than 300 Lebanese Shiites in the Khiam jail in south Lebanon.
   Release of these prisoners has been a major demand by the Shiite
Moslem groups believed to be holding 16 Western hostages. The
hostages are six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two
Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Longest held of the hostages in Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Keenan, a bachelor, was kidnapped April 11, 1986, on his way to
the University of Beirut where he taught English. He was traveling
on an Irish passport but had left it home that day.
   No group claimed responsibility for holding him. But when
American hostage Frank Reed was freed on April 30, he said he was
held with Keenan and British journalist John McCarthy, who he
described as both fit and well.

   The Justice Ministry rejected Amnesty
International's criticism of Israel's handling of the Palestinian
uprising as ``incomplete and misleading'' and based on information
from politically motivated sources.
   In its global survey released Wednesday, the human rights
organization said many Palestinian victims in the uprising died
``in circumstances suggesting excessive use of force or deliberate
killings.''
   About 25,000 Palestinians were detained, often without charge or
trial, and by year's end over 13,000 were still jailed, Amnesty
said.
   It said thousands of Palestinians were beaten and kicked,
sometimes for refusing to remove roadblocks and paint over
anti-Israeli graffiti.
   ``There were reports of torture and systematic ill-treatment of
political detainees, including beatings on various parts of the
body, hooding, deprivation and confinement in coffin-sized cells,''
said the organization, which has its headquarters in London.
   In its response, the Justice Ministry said Amnesty failed to
give an adequate picture of violence in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where Palestinians have carried out a 31-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   The territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians, were captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The ministry said Amnesty's report ``omits that during 1989
there were 41,161 public disturbances, 359 cases of arson, 734
attacks using Molotov cocktails, 12 grenade attacks and 80
shootings'' in the occupied lands.
   These resulted in 385 Israeli civilians and 909 soldiers being
hospitalized, it said.
   ``As a result of these omissions, Amnesty International's
portrayal of the intefadeh (uprising) in the administered areas is
incomplete and misleading,'' the ministry said.
   Amnesty ``relies heavily on politically motivated sources'' in
describing cases of Palestinian detainees, it said.
   The Justice Ministry did not directly respond to the Amnesty
statement that 260 Palestininans were killed by army gunfire during
1989, but it denied Israel carried out deliberate killings.
   According to figures compiled by The Associated Press, 724
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians
during the uprising.
   An additional 233 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-four Israelis
have been slain by Palestinians.
   The army also dismissed Amnesty's allegation of ``excessive or
indiscriminate'' force by soldiers.
   An army spokesman said that in maintaining law and order in the
territories, Israel ``seeks to find the proper balance between
security and humanitarian requirements.''
   Soldiers have strict orders on the use of force and faced
penalties for violations, said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified by name under army regulations.
   ``Force may be used to stop violent activity and to overcome
resistance to arrest,'' he said. ``Force is prohibited as a form of
punishment or to deliberately inflict injuries.
   ``While some excesses have occurred, these have been
unacceptable departures from policy and have been dealt with
accordingly.''

<HEAD>Dowaliby Sentenced to 45 years In Daughter's Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of murdering his 7-year-old
daughter and staging a break-in to conceal the crime was sentenced
Tuesday to 45 years in prison.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Richard Neville sentenced David
Dowaliby to 40 years for murdering Jaclyn Dowaliby and five years
for concealing the homicide.
   Before his sentencing, Dowaliby once again tried to persuade the
judge that he did not kill his daughter. The 33-year-old former
construction foreman contends an intruder broke into his home and
kidnapped his daughter.
   ``She had a right to live,'' Dowaliby said. ``Who would kill an
innocent child? An animal. A monster. That's not me.''
   Dowaliby was convicted by a jury May 3. His daughter's body was
found in a wooded area four days after she was reported missing in
September 1988.
   ``David Dowaliby is definitely going to prosecute an appeal,''
said Dowaliby's attorney. Ralph Meczyk. ``He is numb.''
   During the trial in May, Neville ordered charges against
Dowaliby's wife, Cynthia, dropped because of a lack of evidence.
   Mrs. Dowaliby has crusaded to prove her husband's innocence, and
to regain custody of the couple's two other children, currently
living with relatives.
   ``David is an innocent man,'' she said Tuesday. ``This is a
travesty of justice and it should be stopped.''

   A manufacturer of outdoor picnic equipment on
Tuesday recalled hoses for 30,000 smoker-cookers because of
possible fire hazards.
   The Coleman Co., Inc. recalled the hoses that connect to the
propane gas tanks of its ``Cookin' Machines'' because they may
loosen from the valve connection after repeated use, said the
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   ``If the hose should loosen when the valve is turned on, fuel
may leak from the hose and could present a risk of personal injury
or property damage if ignited,'' the agency said.
   There have been at least five reported incidents of loosened
hoses causing fire damage, said the CPSC.
   The potentially hazardous hoses are installed on cookers
manufactured by the Kansas-based company between November 1987 and
March 1989.
   Consumers should discontinue use of the cookers immediately and
contact Coleman at 1-800-835-3278 for instructions on free
replacement of the hoses.

<HEAD>Sikh Extremists Assassinate Moderate Punjab Leader, Three Aides</HEAD>

   Militant Sikh separatists shot to death
a moderate Sikh leader, his two bodyguards and their driver on
Tuesday in the northern state of Punjab, police said.
   Balwant Singh, 61, a former finance minister in Punjab and a
leading industrialist, was assassinated as he returned home from
his factory near the state capital of Chandigarh, they reported.
   Police blamed Sikh extremists fighting for an independent
homeland in Punjab, a rich farming region bordering Pakistan. The
separatists say the Hindu-dominated government discriminated
against Sikhs.
   Sikh gunmen also were blamed for killing six other people across
the state on Monday night, United News of India said.
   The deaths bring to 1,342 the number of people killed by Sikh
extremists in Punjab this year.
   In the neighboring state of Jammu-Kashmir, Indian border guards
on Tuesday killed six Moslem militants who were trying to cross
over into Pakistan in the Kupwara region, about 50 miles northwest
of Srinagar, the state capital.
   Elsewhere in Kashmir, Moslem separatists killed three Moslems
and a Hindu man in separate incidents, said state government
officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   At least 716 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20,
when the government launched a crackdown on separatists fighting
for an independent Kashmiri state.
   Indian officials say the Moslem separatists receive weapons and
training in Pakistan. The Pakistani government denies it.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan meanwhile met Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Tuesday as she continued a
tour aimed at gaining support in other Moslem countries for her
Kashmir policy.
   Officials accompanying her said she would seek support for
taking up the Kashmir issue at an Islamic foreign ministers'
conference in Cairo this month.
   Pakistan wants Indian Kashmiris to be allowed to decide their
own future through a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite. India insists that
Jammu-Kashmir remain part of India.
   In Punjab, Ashok Kapoor, a deputy police superintendent, gave
this account of the assassination:
   Three men in a car drew alongside Singh's escort car and opened
fire with automatic rifles.
   The escort vehicle hit the rear of Singh's car. In the confusion
the attackers fired another burst, killing Singh and the other
occupants of his car.
   Singh, leader of the moderate Akali Dal-Badal Party, was the
chief architect of a 1985 accord with the federal government that
sought to fulfill Sikh demands for more autonomy in Punjab.
   Sikh extremists opposed the accord, saying it did not meet their
demand for independence. They targeted Singh and other Sikh
moderates involved in the accord.
   Extremist violence led the Indian government to impose direct
federal rule on Punjab in May 1987.
   Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's 880 million people but make
up a slight majority in Punjab. Hindus comprise 82 percent of the
population nationwide.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze has asked his Warsaw Pact colleagues to prepare a
joint response to NATO's offer of a non-aggression declaration,
East Germany's foreign minister said Tuesday.
   The minister, Markus Meckel, told reporters after meeting with
North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials that he received a
letter from Shevardnadze on Monday.
   In it, he said, Shevardnadze solicited proposals for a Warsaw
Pact response regarding what form a non-aggression declaration
should take.
   He said the same letter was sent to the foreign ministers of the
other Warsaw Pact countries _ Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania and Bulgaria.
   Meckel said Shevardnadze suggested in his letter that NATO
representatives be invited to attend some Warsaw Pact meetings,
perhaps those of its consultative political committee.
   However, NATO sources who requested anonymity said the alliance
would be reluctant to accept such an invitation since it would
legitimize the Soviet-led military alliance in its present form.
   At last week's summit in London, leaders of the 16 NATO
countries proposed that the Warsaw Pact and NATO sign a joint
declaration in which both alliances would declare they no longer
are adversaries.
   They also invited Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
other Warsaw Pact leaders to address the NATO council of ministers
in Brussels and appoint ambassadors to NATO.
   Also on Tuesday, Czechoslovakia invited members of NATO's
political committee to visit Prague.
   Earlier in the day, Meckel proposed limiting the size of the
unified German army to 300,000 troops, down from a current total of
635,000 in East and West Germany.
   ``I have the impression this is acceptable to NATO,'' said
Meckel, the fifth Warsaw Pact foreign minister to visit NATO
headquarters in Brussels in recent months.
   West Germany's military now totals 465,000 troops and East
Germany's about 170,000. Within the West German coalition
government, proposals for troop ceilings for a unified Germany
range from 320,000 to 380,000.

   A Mohawk activist convicted of leading
armed resistance to a federal gambling raid last summer at the St.
Regis Indian Reservation was sentenced Tuesday to 10 months in jail.
   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn imposed the sentence on
Kakwirakeron, also known as Arthur Montour, after rejecting the
federal prosecutor's recommendation for a jail term of a year or
longer.
   McCurn also rejected the defense's plea to give Kakwirakeron six
months probation.
   ``I do not beg for mercy. Whatever sentence you wish to impose,
I accept _ but not as a criminal,'' Kakwirakeron said at the
conclusion of a gripping 15-minute oration before he was sentenced.
   ``It is not criminal to stand up and defend your people,'' said
Kakwirakeron, who called himself ``a prisoner of an undeclared war
on the Mohawk nation.''
   About 35 supporters, including Kakwirakeron's wife, Verna, began
shouting obscenities at McCurn as the judge left the courtroom. A
tearful Kakwirakeron removed the warrior's feather and spiritual
beads he wore during the two-hour hearing and hugged his crying
children and friends before being escorted from the courtroom by
federal marshals.
   Kakwirakeron, 47, was convicted April 10 of conspiracy and
forcibly impeding the execution of federal search warrants during
the July 20 raid at St. Regis. He was found innocent of using a
dangerous weapon to turn back FBI agents, a more serious felony
charge.
   Authorities accused Kakwirakeron of leading a group of heavily
armed Mohawks who set up a barricade outside two reservation
casinos and refused to let authorities pass.
   The presence of the casinos has been at the center of a
leadership dispute among the Mohawks for more than a year. In May,
two Mohawks were killed in a gunfight between pro- and
anti-gambling factions, prompting New York and Canadian authorities
to seal off the reservation for nearly three weeks to restore peace.
   Tribal and state officials are negotiating an agreement that
would allow regulated gambling.

   New York's highest court Tuesday refused to
hear lawyer Alton Maddox' appeal of his suspension for obstructing
the state's investigation into the Tawana Brawley abduction case.
   Miss Brawley claimed she was abducted and raped by six white men
in 1987, when she was 15. After a much-publicized investigation, a
grand jury concluded in 1988 that she made up the story.
   A state appeals court suspended Maddox in May after he refused
to appear before the court's disciplinary committee in its
investigation of the Brawley.
   On advice from Maddox, attorney C. Vernon Mason and the Rev. Al
Sharpton, a black civil rights activist, Miss Brawley didn't
cooperate with police or grand jury investigations. Maddox claimed
authorities were engaged in a racist cover-up.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams filed complaints with a judicial
panel in 1988, accusing Maddox of making baseless claims against
Abrams and other officials in the case.
   Maddox couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Ten political parties have
threatened to call a general strike unless the government arrests
two former high-ranking officials accused of anti-democratic
violence.
   In a joint statement, the political parties called for the
arrest of former Army Maj. Gen. Williams Regala and former Defense
and Interior Minister Roger Lafontant.
   Otherwise, the parties said a one-day general strike would take
place Wednesday, according to independent Radio Haiti-Inter.
   The re-emergence of Regala and Lafontant in Haiti last week
heightened fears of an organized attempt to disrupt presidential
elections scheduled for Nov. 4.
   Regala was the alleged mastermind of the 1987 election day
massacre in which thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to
death at least 34 voters at polling stations. He was retired from
the army in 1988 and has lived in the United States since then.
   On Friday, the independent Electoral Council denounced Regala's
public reappearance, saying it ``heralded the return of other
henchmen of violence.''
   Lafontant headed the dreaded National Security Volunteers,
popularly known as the Tonton Macoutes, the secret police force set
up by the dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who died in 1971.
   He was regarded as the power behind Duvalier's son, Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc,'' who fled into exile in February 1986.
   On Monday night, independent Tele-Haiti retransmitted a 1986
CBS-TV report in which the Rev. Leroy Antoine, a Roman Catholic
priest, said he was beaten for four hours in Lafontant's presence,
forced to eat his own excrement, covered with syrup and dumped on
an ant heap. Lafontant, interviewed on the same CBS program, denied
the accusation.
   Government prosecutor Bayard Vincent issued a warrant for
Lafontant's arrest on Saturday, the day the former official arrived
from neighboring Dominican Republic where he had lived in exile
since 1986. But the warrant presumably had not been served by late
Monday.
   The 19-member Council of State, which governs alongside
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, issued a statement Monday
denouncing Lafontant and Regala as ``threats to public peace'' and
demanded they be arrested and tried.
   In a radio interview Saturday, Lafontant, a physician, denied he
had ever carried out crimes against the people and said he had no
intention of interfering with the upcoming elections.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's civilian caretaker government was
brought to power March 13, after a popular uprising toppled
military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.

   President Bush discarded a prepared toast and
simply welcomed his economic summit partners to a glittering dinner
Tuesday night with the admonition, ``We just want you to have a
very, very good time.''
   In brief opening remarks before dinner at the modernistic Brown
Pavilion of the city's Museum of Fine Arts, Bush told his 110
guests, ``There is no working tonight, no communiques, no
amendments, no language to be corrected.''
   A White House press aide said later the president skipped the
formal toast because he had left his notecards back at his hotel.
   Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and their wives greeted the
guests at the door of the museum and led them to a side gallery for
an hour of cocktails before sitting down to a dinner of roast
medallion of veal, chilled yellow tomato soup, sweet corn pudding
and other delectables, topped by a dessert of cobbler of Cherokee
blackberries.
   Bush sat between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the president of France. The
president's table was placed next to a full-length portrait of
Alexander Hamilton painted by John Turnbull in 1792.
   The crowd included not only the presidents, prime ministers and
their spouses, but Texas Gov. Bill Clements and a small sampling of
Houston's elite, including the heads of three universities and
Mayor Kathy Whitemire.
   Some 80 other prominent Houstonians, including captains of
business, summit organizers and others, came in just for the
after-dinner drinks and entertainment provided by comedian Michael
Davis, country singer Ricky Skaggs, singer Marilyn McCoo, actress
Cicely Tyson and mezzo-soprano Fredrica Von Stade.
   The White House press office distributed an advance text of a
toast in which Bush briefly reviewed the astonishing events since
the last economic summit in Paris, including the collapse of the
Berlin Wall.
   The president said part of the credit for those changes had to
be given to ``four decades of purpose and perseverance from the
peoples and the nations represented in this room.''
   ``I raise a glass: To friendship. To freedom. To the spirit of
the old West. And to the promise of the new West, that permanent
alliance of the great democracies,'' Bush's prepared toast said.

   United Parcel Service announced Tuesday it
would fuel a small experimental fleet of delivery vans with natural
gas in a fresh attempt to fight smog in the city with the nation's
dirtiest air.
   ``UPS has taken the initiative in converting their fleet to this
alternative fuel source that has proven to be an effective
combatant to the pollutants that destroy the quality of our air in
Los Angeles,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said in a statement lauding the
program. ``I congratulate the commitment of this company.''
   In a pilot program, the carrier will operate a fleet of 20
vehicles on natural gas supplied by the Southern California Gas Co.
If successful, the entire Los Angeles UPS fleet of more than 2,000
trucks will be converted in the next five years.
   ``We are looking forward to pursuing this effort in Los Angeles
and to sharing the knowledge we gain with the city and its
citizens,'' said Siro DeGasperis, a UPS spokesman.
   ``We feel that our efforts will contribute to a safer and
healthier environment in the Los Angeles basin,'' he said.
   The program follows one in New York in which 10 UPS vans were
converted to natural gas with the help of the Brooklyn Union Gas
Co. Each of the 10 vehicles cost $3,000 to $3,500 to convert to
natural gas.
   The New York fleet that took part in the program reduced its
carbon monoxide production by 85 percent, nitrogen oxide by 25
percent, carbon dioxide by 23 percent and hydrocarbons by 13
percent.
   Drastic measures have been taken to ease smog in Los Angeles,
which has more than 7.5 million vehicles and suffers the nation's
worst air pollution. Air quality regulators approved a plan last
year calling for 40 percent of cars and 70 percent of trucks in the
region to run on cleaner fuels by 1998.
   Unocal Corp. is offering free smog checks and emission control
tune-ups for pre-1975 cars at participating Unocal 76 stations.
Shell Oil Co. is selling SU 2000E gasoline in nine smoggy cities
including Los Angeles and San Diego. The gas reduces polluting
emissions.
   Los Angeles has a smog snitch hotline for motorists to call in
license plate numbers of cars that spew noxious emissions from
tailpipes.

<HEAD>State Attorney General Accused of Felony Theft by Deception</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A county prosecutor asked a judge Tuesday to
charge the state attorney general with felony theft for allegedly
wining and dining private guests on the taxpayers' tab and
falsifying expense claims.
   In a 55-page affidavit, Pulaski County Prosecutor Chris Piazza
asked Little Rock Municipal Judge Marion Humphrey to approve a
felony theft by deception charge against Attorney General Steve
Clark.
   Humphrey said he would rule Wednesday on whether there is
probable cause to file the charge in Pulaski County Circuit Court,
and on a motion by Clark's lawyer to keep the investigative file
closed for fear the publicity could influence any trial.
   The lawyer, Bill Bristow, said Clark would plead innocent if the
charge is filed.
   Clark, attorney general for 12 years, withdrew from the
gubernatorial race in February after the Arkansas Gazette reported
on discrepancies in his expense reports.
   Piazza's affidavit outlines 56 cases in which state police
accuse Clark of charging the state for meals or drinks with guests,
including judges and fellow attorneys general, who said either they
weren't present or that private matters were discussed.
   The affadavit, which covers July 1986 to Feb. 9, says police
found 86 transactions billed to the state for a total of $8,448.27
in expenses unconnected to state business.
   Felony theft by deception carries a maximum penalty of five to
20 years in jail and a $15,000 fine, Piazza said.
   ``Steve Clark executed an unauthorized control of property that
belonged to the state of Arkansas and that property amounted to
more than $2,500,'' making the alleged crime a felony under state
law, Piazza said.
   Bristow said Clark would be unavailable for comment Tuesday.
Clark didn't return messages left at his office, and calls to his
home went unanswered.
   But Bristow said earlier that Clark had been willing to plead
guilty to a misdemeanor charge for falsifying his office expense
records.
   ``There is a statute in Arkansas which makes it a Class B
misdemeanor if you make any kind of false entry in a public record.
If you make a mistake in the public record that statute would, in
my judgment, apply,'' Bristow said.
   He said Clark ``strenuously, heatedly'' denied committing a
felony, and said he doubted Clark would resign.
   Bristow said he couldn't discuss specifics of his talks with
Piazza, but indicated Piazza held out for a felony plea.
   ``I have told them my views about what took place in this matter
_ that Mr. Clark has indicated that there was some record-keeping
mistake, but he was not guilty of taking any kind of money,''
Bristow said in a telephone interview.
   The state attorney general is not required to itemize
expenditures. Clark has said he went beyond the law to be more
accountable, but made mistakes when he tried to itemize expenses 60
and 90 days after the fact.

   Three months ago, East
Germany's new democratic government invited Jews worldwide to

its offer and are seeking sanctuary on German soil.
   Now, the government says Soviet Jews may not qualify for refugee
status under the immigration laws East Germany is likely to enact

   Both the Democrats and the Republicans
are underdogs in the Connecticut governor's race this year. Voters
seem smitten with the third-party campaign of a maverick ex-senator
they ousted from office just 1{ years ago.
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr. narrowly lost his bid for a fourth Senate
term in 1988 but roared back onto the state's political scene in
March, forsaking the GOP and declaring his candidacy as an
independent.
   Poll after poll has found Weicker to be the frontrunner in the
gubernatorial race, far ahead of the two congressmen who are
expected to claim the Republican and Democratic nominations.
   But Weicker _ who created his own party, the Connecticut Party _
discounts the polls. He remembers 1988, when he was favored for
re-election to the Senate and lost by 10,000 votes to Democrat
Joseph Lieberman.

   A parents group is battling charges of
censorship as its campaign for voluntary warning stickers on
records promoting bigotry, rape and murder wins allies in
legislatures and within the music industry.
   The Parents Music Resource Center founded by Elizabeth
``Tipper'' Gore says it is promoting truth-in-packaging to help
parents and their children deal with an entertainment culture that
is increasingly violent and sexually explicit.
   ``Part of our problem is our culture tends to look at children
as miniature adults,'' said Jennifer Norwood, executive director of
the parents group. ``We expect them to handle things they're not
ready to handle yet at their age. Groups like 2 Live Crew are
dealing with adult issues.''
   But some opponents say the labels are censorship because artists
and record companies are pressured to use them.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev handily won re-election
Tuesday as Soviet Communist Party leader from a congress that
assailed him for eight days but concluded the party could not
survive without him.
   Although opposition appeared to melt away as the delegates
considered electing a new general secretary, a sizable
anti-Gorbachev sentiment was evident in the balloting.
   Delegates at the 28th congress of the Soviet Communist Party
voted 3,411 to 1,116 to keep Gorbachev as general secretary. His
opponent, Teimuraz Avaliani, a Siberian party leader, received 501
votes to 4,026.
   Under congress' rules, delegates are required to take a separate
vote on each candidate. It was the first time a general secretary
was elected by a congress and not a plenary meeting of the Central
Committee.

   Savings and loan bailout officials approved a
policy Tuesday they hope will save taxpayers' money by selling
insolvent thrifts before the institutions lose value during months
of government control.
   In a major strategy shift, the board of the Resolution Trust
Corp., created last summer to clean up the S&amp;L industry, voted 4-0
to adopt a program to find buyers for weak thrifts before, rather
than after, they fail.
   Previously, failed S&amp;Ls were declared insolvent by the Office of
Thrift Supervision, an arm of the Treasury Department, and turned
over to the RTC. Later _ sometimes more than a year later _ the
trust corporation provided government assistance to new investors
to acquire the thrift.
   RTC Chairman L. William Seidman contends that simply declaring
an institution failed reduces its value because depositors withdraw
money and key employees find other jobs.

   Police perusing demonology books as they prepare
for a feared attack Thursday by the Zodiac gunman say he may have
learned some of his victims' birthdays from Census data or Social
Security forms.
   All four of the shootings by the gunman so far have been in the
early morning hours on a Thursday. The last one came three weeks
ago Thursday, and the previous spacing of the attacks has led
police to focus on this Thursday.
   ``Tomorrow night is a target night,'' Police Department
spokeswoman Suzanne Trazoff said Tuesday.
   All of the gunman's victims were defenseless at the time they
were shot. Two walked with canes; one was inebriated; one was a
homeless man sleeping on a Central Park bench. Three victims
survived the attacks; a fourth died.

   Like wallflowers at a junior-high dance, the
Rikers Island inmates hung back. Maybe they knew their streetwise
facades were about to be punctured by puppy love.
   For two hours, these teen-agers could almost forget the
manslaughter, kidnapping or car theft charges that landed them
behind bars. Instead, they played with seven visiting dogs and
cats, a rare touch of tenderness provided monthly by volunteers
from the Animal Medical Center.
   ``My friends think I'm totally nuts, but it's not dangerous as
people perceive it,'' said Edith McBean, the center's outreach
coordinator, who goes to Rikers with Casey, a Jack Russell terrier
puppy, and Keen, a Labrador retriever.
   ``For those two hours, the machismo is dropped; they're just
little boys,'' said Diane Smith, coordinator of volunteer visits
for the Rikers health services unit.
   The goals of these visits, which started three years ago, are to
decrease depression, stress and loneliness and to improve
self-images, social skills and self-control. The inmates, ages 16
to 19, were chosen because their families and friends don't visit.
   ``Even though they're not family, it's something. These people
go out of their way,'' said James, a 19-year-old inmate who dreams
of becoming a mechanic and having a cat. ``It makes you feel open,
good inside. It gets your mind away from the problems you've got.
It makes you feel special.''
   ``We're coming in without an agenda _ we're not writing a paper,
not there to save souls,'' said Susan Cohen, a therapist on the
Animal Medical Center staff. ``Pets are an icebreaker. Otherwise,
what would we say to them: `Do you come here often?'''
   The results haven't been analyzed, but at least one effect is
evident.
   ``There are a lot of fights among the adolescents: slashings and
stabbings, that sort of thing,'' said Smith. ``Once they're put
into a relaxed mood, there's less of a chance of fighting _ at
least, that day.''
   On a recent night, 10 volunteers arrived in an ebullient conga
line, cats yawning and dogs yapping as they passed through four
security checkpoints. Some are employees of the medical center,
some are volunteers there, and most bring their own pets.
   Toys, water bowls, dog treats and bags of cookies were piled in
the otherwise-dismal visitors' room. The five dogs raced around,
wagging, sniffing and barking.
   At first, the 16 inmates huddled in knots of three or four.
Under the gaze of uniformed officers, the volunteers fanned out,
helping the pets introduce themselves. The two cats were coaxed
from their carriers and gently placed on laps.
   The prisoners, eyes filled with uncertainty, masked their
vulnerability with bravado. Several bragged that they'd once owned
the meanest dog on the block. Some teased the dogs, holding toys or
food out of reach.
   ``I tell them to knock it off in a nice way. They stop, maybe
after you've said it five times,'' said McBean.
   Eventually, everyone started to relax. ``It's nice to see how
they soften up,'' she said.
   The beefiest inmates zeroed in on the brawny dogs, like Teddy,
an Appenzeller brought by Debra Liccardi, a dog walker, and Nick G.
Hayden, vice president of a real estate company.
   ``Teddy's got a tough-looking appearance that a lot of guys at
prison love,'' said Hayden.
   Hayden and Liccardi have been going to Rikers for five months
with pets they borrow from her clients. She gets the inmates
acquainted with the dogs; he talks to them about other things.
   ``It's a matter of sitting there and listening,'' said Hayden.
``They're all extremely polite. It's sometimes hard to keep in
perspective that they're not all saints.''
   At least until he hears their stories.
   ``One kid attempted murder a couple of times; another was in for
possession of a 9mm-gun, an Uzi and vials of crack. I'm sure if I'd
seen him on the street, I'd have known he was trouble and walked
away,'' Hayden said. ``But I sat there, talking to him for an
hour.''
   Some inmates sat quietly, stroking the more tranquil pets, as
they spoke with the volunteers.
   ``I like to observe them; they have their own little world,''
said Danny, 19. ``I wonder what they think about us.''
   ``There are times you do get lonely,'' confessed Jamar, 18. ``I
miss my family, girlfriend, brothers and sister.''
   ``My brothers are facing hard time; I pray for them every
night,'' said James. ``After a visit (from the animals), it's hard
when you go back to the house.''
   It wasn't long, though, before James went back.
   An officer bellowed; the inmates filed out. The dogs, panting,
sprawled on the floor; the cats hid beneath blankets in their
carriers. A corrections worker searched for the key that would
return the visitors to freedom.
   ``You spend a couple of hours, and feel like you do something
good for them,'' said Hayden. ``But you leave very confused,
frustrated.''
   Still, he concluded, ``If we can get one guy out and keep him
out, I think it's worth it.''

   You're a legislator, facing tough decisions.
Bound to be controversial, sure to set barn fires no matter how you
decide.
   Then someone has a bright idea: let the people decide. Put the
issue on the ballot and put the question to the people. What could
be more democratic?
   Is that buck-passing?
   Or is it direct, participatory democracy?
   Yes it is and yes it is, said Patrick B. McGuigan, an Oklahoman
who has been keeping track of ballot propositions at the
conservative Free Congress Foundation for years.
   Yes, said McGuigan, when legislatures put issues on the ballot
``it becomes a way for legislators to avoid doing what we elect
them to do.''
   And, yes, said McGuigan, ``it is an expression of confidence in
ourselves.'' He said it makes citizens more involved in everyday
politics, more aware of the issues.
   ``Every meaningful criticism that can be made against the
initiative process has an exact corollary in every other aspect of
our democratic system,'' he said.
   In any event, ballot-box lawmaking is a growing phenomena.
Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia allow referendums
(issues referred to the people by the legislatures) or initiatives
(issues on the ballot at the initiative of voters), but only about
a dozen states use these processes with much regularity.
   In 1988, voters decided on 229 statewide issues. They ranged
from repealing a gun control law in Maryland (no dice, said the
voters) to discouraging tobacco use by increasing cigarette taxes
25 cents in California (that passed despite a $15 million industry
campaign against it).
   This year, even more issues are likely to be voted upon,
including tax limitation issues, tax increases for specific
purposes and measures to limit the terms of legislators.
   You can argue for it: it is direct democracy.
   You can argue against it: Citizens are called to make decisions
without having heard the pros and cons. They don't have to consider
priorities (voting money for the homeless might take money from the
sick or the schools). They can be influenced by expensive
advertising campaigns mounted by special interests.
   Thomas Cronin, a Colorado College political scientist and author
of ``Direct Democracy: The Politics of the Initiative, Referendum
and Recall,'' is a middle-of-the-roader. Like McGuigan, he sees
both sides.
   If citizens don't know what they're voting on, legislators often
don't either, he said. They pass a lot of bills in a frantic final
burst; they spend about a third of each session amending or
otherwise repairing measures passed the previous session. And they
are influenced by political action committees, lobbyists and
special interests, too.
   On the other hand, Cronin's research found that 10 percent to 15
percent of the voters who go to the polls (often only 50 percent of
the electorate) do not vote on ballot issues ``and another 10
percent really don't know what they're voting on.''
   ``So the answer is that both of these processes ought to be of
concern,'' he said. ``Why do we have referendums? It's because our
system has become far less democratic in practice tha in the
textbooks. In the ideal type of world, we would not have to resort
to initiative-referendum campaigns because we would have such
responsible, responsive legislatures they wouldn't be necessary.''
   Cronin finds that elected officeholders, scholars and
journalists tend to be opposed to direct democracy devices. They
think the issues are too complicated, that issues first should be
aired at hearings, that compromises _ the essence of democracy _
can't be molded by a citizen facing a yes-or-no choice.
   The argument comes down, Cronin said, to philosophy. It is a
case of the populists, who think the people always know best, vs.
``parentalists,'' who think papa knows best.
   He notes that voters sometimes use the ballot to strike back at
big government: Massachusetts voters vetoed both a mandatory seat
belt law and a salary increase for state legislators one year.
   McGuigan and Cronin share a concern about what happens when too
many issues crowd themselves onto the ballot. In 1988, so many
questions were on the California ballot that express lines were
created for voters who promised to spend only five minutes marking
their ballot.
   Cronin said the growth in ballot issues is a result, too, of the
way incumbents have become almost undefeatable.
   ``Regular elections in America are increasingly meaningless,''
he said. ``Ninety-five percent of incumbents at the state and
national level get reelected routinely. In Colorado, only once in
the 1980s did a state senator get defeated. That's not untypical.''
   ``If we have no turnover, no real competition, then the people
with a grievance have two choices _ form a PAC if they have lots of
money, or get their issue on the ballot if they don't.''

<TEXT>
   In partly cloudy skies over Florida's
Everglades, a cruising Cessna 172 suddenly turns and plunges to an
altitude of less than a thousand feet.
   Inside the plane, David Maehr listens to chirping in his
headphones from one of 17 radio-collared Florida panthers roaming
out of sight below.
   ``This is a female that probably had a litter about a week
ago,'' Maehr yells over the roar of the engine, as the pilot pulls
up.
   Maehr is a wildlife biologist with the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission. Three times a week, he or an assistant makes
one of these reconnaissance flight as part of a 10-year study of
the life and times of the Florida panther.
   The panther, a tawny, muscled mountain lion that can weigh up to
150 pounds, may be the most endangered mammal in the United States.
Only 30 to 50 adults remain, and they may not last much longer.
   Ironically, their survival may now be threatened by the very
people charged with protecting them.
   State and federal authorities have proposed a crash program to
trap panthers, breed them in captivity and release them in suitable
areas.
   Critics say the program calls for the capture of too many
panthers too soon. They fear it could make panthers extinct in the
wild.
   ``We're moving into this at a level that's potentially going to
put the natural population at risk,'' said James Layne, a biologist
at the Archbold Biological Station in Lake Placid, Fla., and a
member of the Florida Panther Technical Advisory Committee. ``It's
not at the critical level where we've got to pull all the animals
in.''
   Layne and other critics charge that the highly visible
captive-breeding program is calculated to distract public attention
from the panthers' greatest need: the acquisition and protection of
the land they live on.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will issue a final
environmental assessment of the captive-breeding program shortly
after August 15, the deadline for public comments on the draft
assessment. The capture of panthers could begin next winter.
   ``We feel this is the only alternative,'' said Dennis Jordan,
the Fish and Wildlife Service's coordinator for the Florida panther
project. ``Otherwise, I don't think there's any question, it's
going to go extinct,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
Gainesville office.
   The Florida panther, known scientifically as Felis concolor
coryi, is a fierce, solitary hunter. It once roamed unfettered
through the broad crescent made up of eastern Texas, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, parts of Tennessee and
South Carolina, and Florida.
   The panther is now found only in the southern third of the
Florida peninsula. It roams through mixed-swamp forests, hardwood
hammocks, slash pine-saw palmetto woodlands and oak-pine forests.
The area is crisscrossed with rivers and swamps that make it almost
impenetrable.
   ``One of the reasons they survived is probably because the area
is so remote,'' Maehr said in an interview in his Naples office,
near the western extent of the panther's range. The wetlands offer
no impediment to panthers, which are strong swimmers. They move
freely in pursuit of deer, wild hogs, rabbits and other prey.
   The panther recovery project was established in 1981. It has
pointed to one overall conclusion. ``The habitat loss is the most
important problem facing panthers. Every problem the panther has is
the result of habitat loss,'' said Maehr.
   About half of the 4 million acres of known panther habitat is on
private land, where citrus and vegetable farming and urban
development are a growing threat, Maehr said. ``It's directly
related to population growth,'' he said. Florida's population
increases by 8,000 every week, Maehr said.
   The land-development grab and consequent deforestation of
southern Florida is similar to what's happening in the Amazon rain
forest, Maehr said. ``It's the same thing _ you cut the forest and
you eliminate the places for these animals to live.''
   In Brazil, the culprits are often subsistence farmers struggling
to feed their families. In Florida, Maehr said, the forest is being
destroyed by ``corporations and ranchers, people who have money to
begin with.''
   Loss of the forest would mean more than loss of the panthers, he
said. ``The loss would make the area less suitable for people to
live in. It's important for air quality and water quality and as a
buffer against so many people. If we save the panthers, we'll be
doing ourselves a favor.''
   Despite the threats to the panthers, the population is currently
holding steady, Maehr said.
   That is why Layne and other critics oppose a large-scale
captive-breeding program.
   ``This crash program is based on the assumption this present
population is in serious decline,'' says Layne. ``If you look at
the reports, you would have to conclude the population is
increasing. And they're kicking out young.''
   Layne thinks a smaller captive-breeding program would be a good
idea, in which only young panther kittens would be removed. ``The
thing that scares me about the present proposal is taking
established adults out of the population. When you take them out of
a social organization, you disrupt the organization. You disrupt
the behavior.''
   Earth First! activists have threatened the Fish and Wildlife
Service with a lawsuit if it issues permits for capturing panthers.
The Humane Society, the Fund for Animals and many other
conservation groups have criticized the plan.
   More than 300 organizations or individuals have commented on the
plan, said Jordan of the Fish and Wildlife Service. ``Most of the
comments reflected concern about the program,'' he said.
   Jordan takes a dim view of the wild panthers' prospects for
survival. ``You could have an outbreak of disease that could move
within the population and render it extinct in a short period of
time,'' he said. ``When you have a single population in one small
area like that, you have no security against extinction
whatsoever.''
   Inbreeding among the animals makes it likely they will develop
genetic abnormalities, he said, which could make them extinct in a
few decades.
   Under the captive-breeding proposal, up to 36 kittens and 14
adults could be captured over a six-year period. Capture of the
older animals is necessary to assure that the captive group will
share the same genetic variation as the wild group, Jordan said.
   Where will the captive-bred animals be released? Researchers
don't yet know, but they will begin searching this year for sites
and Jordan is confident they'll find them.
   Texas cougars, which are close cousins of the panthers, will be
released to determine the suitability of the sites. The one such
test so far was not successful. The cougars had to be recaptured
when one wandered into Jacksonville. It frightened the wits out of
a woman who went into her back yard to hang her laundry and saw it
crouched in a tree above her.
   ``We certainly feel we can re-introduce panthers in the
future,'' Jordan said. ``We've only experimented with one area.''
   Jordan noted that the state and federal governments have
acquired about 300,000 acres of panther habitat during the last few
years, and that more habitat would be acquired soon.
   Meanwhile, the panthers seem to be doing well. ``Our
productivity continues at an encouraging rate,'' said Maehr.
``We've had two new litters born, one in March and one in May.''
   But their habitat remains threatened. ``The population can only
increase if there's more habitat,'' said Maehr. ``There's just
nowhere for them to go.''

<HEAD>LaRouche Candidates Running but Not Getting Far</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imprisoned extremist Lyndon LaRouche and his
followers are running in scores of primary and general election
races this year as they try to regroup politically after a string
of legal defeats.
   LaRouche followers stunned and embarrassed the Democratic Party
in 1986 by winning primary nominations for two statewide offices in
Illinois. But this time around, the organization's candidates
appear to be having little success.
   After running for president four times, both as a Democrat and
independent, LaRouche has lowered his sights to a jailhouse
campaign for Congress.
   One of his top lieutenants, Nancy Spannaus, is waging an
independent campaign for the U.S. Senate in Virginia and is the
only candidate running against GOP Sen. John Warner this fall.
State Democratic leaders rebuffed her bid for the party's
nomination _ deciding instead to nominate no one.
   LaRouche himself is serving a 15-year federal prison sentence in
Minnesota for fraud and tax evasion. He is running as an
independent candidate in Virginia's 10th District, in the
Washington suburbs, against Republican Rep. Frank Wolf.
   ``You don't need an analyst to tell you LaRouche doesn't have
much popular support. But they know the political process,'' said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. ``It
doesn't constitute an endorsement of LaRouche or his policies, but
they will inherit votes simply by being on the ballot, and they
will undoubtedly claim some great movement.''
   Aside from a few minor victories in Texas, and a candidate who
got 25 percent of the vote in losing a statewide primary there,
LaRouche candidates haven't gained much notice.
   ``We just consider him and his candidates more of a nuisance
now, rather than a threat,'' said Ginny Terzano at the Democratic
National Committee.
   The success of LaRouche candidates in the 1986 Illinois primary
sparked a party effort to warn voters away from LaRouche and his
nightmare conspiracy theories, which some say carry anti-Semitic
themes. It also brought new public scrutiny to his financial
network of corporate shells and high-pressure fund-raising.
   LaRouche and six of his associates, including Spannaus's
husband, Edward, were convicted in December 1988. The case stemmed
from an investigation into more than $30 million in loans raised
from individuals by LaRouche's organization. Prosecutors said the
group used heavy-handed tactics and had no intent to repay the
money it borrowed.
   Dennis King, who has investigated the LaRouche organization for
more than a decade and is the author of a book, ``Lyndon LaRouche
and the New American Fascism,'' says the group receded immediately
after the convictions but has strongly rebounded.
   ``They have made a rather remarkable comeback,'' King said. ``I
don't get the impression the Democratic Party is paying much
attention to this, and they may be in for an unpleasant surprise.''
   Debra Freeman, LaRouche's spokeswoman, estimated that thousands
of LaRouche-connected candidates are running nationally. She
characterized LaRouche's House bid as the organization's ``flagship
candidacy.''
   LaRouche candidates often fare best in races that attract little
attention.
   Some LaRouche followers have won small, uncontested party posts
in Texas, and another ran unopposed to win the Democratic
nomination for Congress in the state's safely Republican 22nd
District.
   In Texas' Democratic Senate primary, LaRouche follower Harley
Schlanger lost to state Sen. Hugh Parmer, who is seeking to oust
Republican Phil Gramm. But Schlanger pulled in 247,205 votes _ a
number the LaRouche organization claimed was a victory in itself.
   Law enforcement officials and others say the LaRouche candidates
don't have to win to succeed. Even losing campaigns generate
publicity and serve as a source of fund-raising.
   ``This business of running for office is one of the techniques
LaRouche people use,'' said Newbold Smith of Paoli, Pa. Smith's
son, Lewis DuPont Smith, is a LaRouche follower and independent
candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania's 5th District.
   ``One, to feed the egos of the people. That's important. This is
a cult,'' the elder Smith said. ``Second, it does bring the
publicity. They don't care whether the publicity is favorable or
unfavorable. And, it allows them to raise money.''
   Newbold Smith and other family members won a court order
declaring the son legally incompetent after the younger Smith _ an
heir to the DuPont fortune _ turned over much of his money to
LaRouche's organization.
   Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show LaRouche
had raised $222,348 for his congressional campaign as of April. His
separate National Democratic Policy Committee reported debts of
$486,934.
   Federal prosecutors argued in court during LaRouche's trial that
his followers raised money by promising it would be used for
specific purposes, such as political efforts, when they knew the
money would be used for other purposes, including supporting him.
   John B. Russell Jr., Virginia senior assistant attorney general,
said a state investigation indicates much of the LaRouche group's
money is being sent to its foreign operations. These include one
based in West Germany, where LaRouche's wife, Helga, is believed to
live.
   Five of LaRouche's followers have been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to state charges in Virginia, and charges against 11 others
are pending. The LaRouche organization is based in Leesburg, Va.
   Prosecutors and law-enforcement officials say the LaRouche
organization continues to use aggressive tactics to secure large
contributions from elderly and vulnerable people, and that their
revenues run in the millions.

   Guns rumble in the dark and tracer bullets cut
across no man's land. Smoke hangs in the air, mingled with the
smells of cordite and frying bacon.
   ``I thought I was back,'' Tommy Keele, a 96-year-old veteran of
World War I, said at the opening last month of a reconstructed
trench of the Western Front.
   Then he added: ``The smell of death _ that's not here.''
   Keele was among guests invited to the unveiling of the Imperial
War Museum's latest attempt to convey the atmosphere of war to
generations that have never known it.
   Britain is caught up in memories of World War II this summer.
Keele, who fought in both wars, said his recollections of World War
I, and the slaughter of the trenches, were the more vivid.
   ``Two of my mates were buried under us by a shell,'' he said.
``We dug them out, horribly mangled, and buried them along the
trench. As I pulled one, he fell to pieces. The smell of death was
all over me and I couldn't eat or drink for three days.''
   A year ago, the Imperial War Museum opened a reconstruction of a
World War II air raid shelter.
   ``Now we have gone farther back to what it was like for the
infantry at the Battle of the Somme in 1916,'' said Dr. Alan Borg,
the museum's director.
   ``We tried to get the trench as right as we could. We found the
only machine left which could sew sandbags the way they were made
in that war, because the method of sewing was changed in the 1920s.
And we went to the old Somme battlefield in France and brought back
two bags of earth to get the texture right for the sides of our
trench.''
   Baron Hermann von Richthofen, the West German ambassador and a
descendant of the German air ace Manfred von Richthofen, the ``Red
Baron,'' attended the opening ceremony.
   The impact of a battlefield is created with life-size models of
soldiers carrying real guns, bayonets and gas masks. There are even
stuffed rats.
   In the freezing early hours of an October morning, a soldier in
a niche in the sandbagged wall fries bacon over a brazier while a
recorded Yorkshire voice reads a genuine letter home.
   ``You asked what life is like in the trenches,'' the soldier
wrote to his father. ``It is very boring most of the time. We sleep
in the day as there's not much to be had at night. You share house
and home with rats and burn lice out of the seat of your pants with
candles.''
   Two sentries light cigarettes. A Lewis gun fires tracers. A
shell has just exploded, demolishing sandbags and pouring fumes
into the narrow trench.
   Artillery roars in the distance. Commands and cries ring out
from a dawn attack going ``over the top.'' A soldier with head and
chest wounds groans.
   In a dugout lie relics from the Western Front: barbed wire
cutters, gas masks, a rattle to warn of a poison gas attack,
ammunition boxes, a sniper shield, a windup phonograph, canned milk
and postcards.
   Four periscopes show no man's land from 100 yards to 2 miles in
a vista created from contemporary photographs.
   Cyril Dennys, 93, fought in the 1917 Battle of Passchendaele. He
recalled that 65,000 tons of shells fired in 17 days to soften up
the enemy also destroyed the drainage system of the level Flemish
plain.
   The attack began and raged for weeks in pitiless rain; men
drowned in the mud. Britain lost 300,000 dead.
   Visitors leaving the trench see a display case containing the
four penciled sheets of the last letter to his wife Lizzie from
Pvt. Jack Mudd of the London Regiment, and the red poppy he sent
home from a Flanders field.
   He put nine crosses for kisses after his signature.
   ``God bless you and my children and may He soon send me back to
those I love is the wish of your faithful husband, Jack,'' is the
last sentence of the letter.
   Mudd was killed at Ypres on Oct. 26, 1917.

<DATELINE>MUNNSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For decades, the Ward ``boys'' tended to
the dairy cows on their farm at the end of a dirt road and,
neighbors say, pretty much minded their own business.
   ``They live off by themselves, but they're not hermits or
recluses,'' said Emilie Stilwell. ``They're a throwback to the
pioneer days. They stick to themselves but if you were raising a
barn, they'd be the first to arrive and the last to leave.''
   Four brothers, four bachelors. That all changed forever June 6
when William Ward died _ of suffocation, authorities said _ and
Delbert Ward was arrested on a second-degree murder charge.
   The tiny rural communities of Munnsville, population 400, and
Stockbridge, population 140, have rallied around Delbert Ward.
Local folks say he could not possibly have killed his brother.
   Supporters collected nearly 900 signatures on petitions calling
on the county prosecutor to review the autopsy results. When a
judge set bail at $10,000 June 25, supporters raised the entire
amount outside the courtroom in a few minutes.
   Delbert, 59, has been advised by his attorney not to discuss the
case. But at a July 8 banquet that raised almost $1,500 for his
defense, he told about 1,000 supporters, ``I have a lot of friends
all over this county. I thought I'd be left in jail, but my friends
brought me home.''
   Said Deborah Wilson of Munnsville, who contributed $500 on the
spot toward Delbert's bail: ``You have to act on your beliefs when
something like this happens. I just know there's no way he could
have killed his brother.''
   State police investigators testified at a preliminary hearing
that Delbert told them the death of his 64-year-old brother Bill
was a mercy killing.
   Investigators say Delbert told them he smothered Bill while his
brother slept. According to the initial autopsy, a benign tumor the
size of a golf ball was found in Bill's neck, and others in his
kidney and prostrate could have been cancerous.
   ``Bill had trouble with his head. He accidentally cut his jaw
with a chain saw (years ago) and got blood poisoning,'' said Roscoe
Ward, at 70 the oldest of the brothers. ``He was doing farm chores
up to the day he died, but he wasn't doing too good. He'd be
burning up, and the next time he'd be shaking all over.''
   Asked if he thought Delbert was innocent, Roscoe Ward replied,
``I sure do.''
   The Wards run a small hilltop dairy farm overlooking the
undeveloped Stockbridge Valley, about 30 miles southeast of
Syracuse.
   A lifetime's collection of odds and ends, old appliances and
crumbling farm equipment lie sprinkled about the rickety four-room
farmhouse where the four brothers spent their entire lives.
   There's running water and electricity, but no telephone and not
much else in the way of conveniences in the rough, unpainted house.
   ``Their parents lived there and they took care of them until
they died, and they just stayed,'' Stilwell said.
   The Wards, especially Delbert and Bill, whom friends say were
inseparable, appeared often at The Shack, the Munnsville coffee
shop where Stilwell works. They also made frequent trips to town to
shop and buy new parts for their farm machinery. None of the four
had driver's licenses; they would ride a tractor the five miles
into town.
   At the July 8 banquet, Stilwell sold several pictures of Delbert
and Bill riding on the tractor for $3 each.
   Unvaryingly, the Wards are described as happy and generous
neighbors, self-educated and hard-working. Delbert is the youngest,
Bill was called the leader, Roscoe never stops talking once he
starts, and Lyman is bashful.
   It wasn't difficult to get townsfolk in Munnsville to rally
around the Wards after Delbert's arrest, said Grant Kroneck, a
local insurance agent.
   ``I've lived in Munnsville since 1947 and I've never seen a
community come so solidly together on one side of an issue that
like this,'' he said.
   Within hours after the arrest, Stilwell and Kroneck were
collecting signatures challenging a medical examiner's autopsy that
ruled Bill was killed, and asking for a second autopsy.
   ``I knew we had some friends,'' said Roscoe Ward. ``I just
didn't know we had friends like that.''
   Madison County District Attorney Donald Cerio Jr. agreed to a
review of the original autopsy and has said he will not seek a
grand jury indictment before that review is completed.
   ``This particular case is quite unique in the intensity of
emotions stirred by those persons acquainted with the Ward
family,'' said Cerio. He said he doesn't believe Delbert is
dangerous, but he is confident he is being justly prosecuted.
   Jars and plastic containers were set out at businesses in town
and within days, supporters contributed $1,800, said Stilwell. The
money was used to hire two private investigators to bolster
Delbert's case. The total raised since has climbed to almost $3,500.
   ``We have such a great love for them. We can't believe Delbert
would kill Bill, who he loved so much,'' said Judi Colclough, the
village clerk.
   ``The Wards are simple, honest people,'' said Kroneck. ``We feel
he is being taken advantage of by the system. All we want is
justice. We don't think the police are terrible people.s accompanying parent

<HEAD>A New Cop Series for Ex-Cop Sonny Grosso</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The beginning for Sonny Grosso was ``The French
Connection,'' the Oscar-winning 1971 film about the famous heroin
case he helped break. He collaborated on the film's writing.
   ``I thought of it as a one-shot deal,'' says Grosso, who at the
time was a New York City narcotics detective.
   But here he is a TV mogul, executive producer of ``Top Cops,'' a
new CBS series that premiered July 18.
   He also is co-executive producer of ``Counterstrike,'' a new USA
Network action-adventure series starring Christopher Plummer in the
actor's first television series.
   Earlier this year, Grosso was co-executive producer of NBC's
``True Blue,'' a series about the New York police department's
emergency services unit. Alas, that one failed to pass Nielsen
muster and expired quickly.
   Now based in Toronto, he agrees it is somewhat of a leap to go
from chasing bad guys as a member of New York's finest to dealing
with stars, agents, screenwriters, network executives and other
such riff-raff.
   ``I didn't know how dangerous this business is,'' he says
half-jokingly of life in film and TV. ``I didn't how how well off I
was in the police department.''
   He never expected to be a writer, then a producer.
   ``God almighty, I still pinch myself,'' says Grosso, who talks
rapid-fire, bouncing from one thought to the next, cheerfully
tossing in an occasional expletive for emphasis.
   He retired from the police department in 1976, having put in 20
years, he says. Since then, he has worked on a variety of films and
TV shows about police work, as a writer, technical consultant,
story consultant and producer.
   Being a retired cop, he often is asked what police films he
finds most realistic. Not many, he replies:
   ``A lot of movies are entertaining as hell, like the `Lethal
Weapons' of the world. But they're tremendous reaches as far as
what happens in a cop's life. Most cops never take their gun out of
their holster.
   ``I'm shocked at the amount of gore and blood and violence that
people are looking for. I long for the days of Mr. Capra,'' he
says, a reference to film director Frank Capra, who made screwball
comedies, many of them sunny side up.
   ``I wish he could come back and do some movies that make you cry
a little bit, make you feel some emotional involvement.''
   Grosso's TV dossier includes ``Kojak,'' ``The Rockford Files,''
``Baretta'' and CBS' old late-night ``Night Heat.'' With the
one-hour ``Top Cops,'' he's entering what is known as ``reality''
TV.
   In each show, three real police officers recount the most
memorable experiences of their careers as each of their stories is
recreated, with actors playing the cops.
   The premiere includes the tale of Paul Ragnese of the New York
Police Department's bomb squad, and how he felt when helping disarm
a particularly complex bomb containing 75 sticks of dynamite,
Grosso says.
   The bomb was found in mid-December 1986 in an empty abortion
clinic in Manhattan. It had been put there by a madman whose target
was the bomb squad.
   The man later surrendered, got a three-year prison term and was
out in two, Grosso says.
   ``I'm really trying to let people understand what it's like'' to
be a cop, he says. ``And that those streets out there are telling
us every day, `Something ain't working, pal.' ''
   Despite 14 years in the entertainment business, Grosso's heart,
as you might expect, remains with cops.
   ``One thing you have going in the police department is that any
cop, no matter who he is, can get a call, `man with a gun' or
`family dispute,' and be right in the middle, his life on the
line,'' he says.
   ``Whereas so many people in this business never take a chance,
never go out on a limb, and never understand the camaraderie, never
understand what it means to get along with people you work with
because you're dependent upon them for your safety.''

   Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, his doomed jetliner wallowing all over
the Iowa sky, responded to an air traffic controller in the
time-honored jargon of his aviation fraternity. There were 296
``souls on board,'' including his own.
   At 3:59 CDT on a sweltering Wednesday afternoon last July 19,
they all rode a 168-ton flying brick down into a cornfield at 200
miles an hour. In the flame and dust unleashed when the DC-10
cartwheeled out of control, 112 of the souls on board United
Airlines Flight 232 were lost.
   But 184 survived. And as they prepare to return to Sioux City
for a memorial service Thursday, they struggle with unanswerable
questions about life and death, guilt, nightmares, physical
injuries that may never heal, strained relationships with people
they love, and memories that deny them a single good night's sleep.
   They shake at some of life's simplest events, afraid that a
highway bridge might fall on them, frightened by the sound and
smoky smell of a child's cap gun, convinced that a washing machine
has an electrical short that will cause a fire.
   Mary Kahl couldn't feel comfortable at work for six months. Paul
Olivier, like many other survivors, won't fly on a DC-10. William
Robertson drew up a list of accomplishments and things he wants to
do in life. Jerry Schemmel quit his job _ too many reminders. Rod
Vetter fears driving into downtown Chicago. What if a car jumps a
guardrail into his lane?
   ``My life is never going to be the same,'' says Upton Rehnberg,
53.
   They question why they lived, when so many others died. They
meet in groups to grieve, they call each other at 3 a.m. to sob,
they savor a unique joy with the coming of new mornings, the sight
of sunsets. Their very survival is a shared miracle.
   ``On the plane as we were going down it didn't matter how rich
or how poor you were, what color you were or what your religion
was, where you came from or where you were going,'' says Garry
Priest, 24, of Denver. ``We all drew strength from each other, we
were all in it together. ... As the plane crashed, everybody was
special.''
   The DC-10 was headed to Chicago from Denver when it attempted an
emergency landing at the Sioux Gateway Airport. The jet flipped
once and burst into flames. Forty-five minutes before impact, the
crew had lost all steering control when the tail engine shattered,
spewing out titanium fan blades and chunks of metal that severed
hydraulic lines.
   Many victims were trapped in the charred fuselage. Some, dazed
and burned, walked or crawled to safety. Others were found in
4-foot-high corn, still buckled in seat belts.
   Dozens of survivors will gather Thursday to pay tribute to
Haynes' crew and to the rescuers and townsfolk who opened their
hearts and their homes to them.
   Though each has a unique memory of that terrible day that bonded
them for life, they're all amazed they are alive, and wonder why.

   Rod Vetter, a 40-year-old former Navy flyer who logged more than
300,000 miles with United before the crash, now hesitates before
commiting to a business trip. Even everyday trips downtown can be a
strain.
   ``I have a fear of things falling and things happening that are
out of my control,'' he says.
   ``I never had the fear driving on the interstate of a bridge
collapsing when I was driving underneath it. I have a fear driving
into downtown Chicago ... (wondering) what if a car jumps the
guardrail and goes into my lane? Just weird things like that.''
   Vetter still thinks of that day frequently.
   ``There's a lot of things that key in the thought of the crash,
whether it's black smoke, loud noise, screeching brakes, the smell
of burning plastic,'' says Vetter, who owns an import-export
electronics company in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights.
   ``Some people are saying they are not letting it out of their
minds. Maybe one year's time is not enough time .... Maybe it will
take 10 years to get back to a rational view of life. It's not
going to heal in a year.''

   Kate Wolfe Bressieux hired a handyman to fix her front steps,
inspect her washing machine and dryer for electrical shorts, and
repair anything else around her house he thought might be a safety
problem. By her own description she ``freaked out'' after a fire in
her basement last Christmas.
   A 36-year-old organizational development consultant, Ms. Wolfe
Bressieux is unemployed and recently separated from her husband.
   Days before any trip, she has nightmares that her car will turn
over and burst in flames.
   ``My life has been in total disarray since the crash. I'm having
real difficulty in putting things back together. I'm a very
extroverted person so I'm amazed I've become so isolated and
withdrawn.
   ``When you are sitting next to someone and five minutes later
they are dead and you aren't, you wonder why you aren't. Having
come that close to my own vulnerability, I don't want to be that
vulnerable again.''

   Paul Olivier has flown more than 100,000 miles since October,
when his broken collarbone, broken right foot, broken right knee,
broken ribs, crushed vertebrae and numerous burns had healed enough
to allow him to resume running his Palmer Lake, Colo.,
television-studio design business.
   Olivier won't fly on a DC-10, but he has flown to Hong Kong 10
times since November. On the last trip as the plane prepared to
land, ``I did everything I could to grab a gulp of air but I just
couldn't breathe. That's the worst it has been. I have to force
myself to get on a plane.''
   Olivier was thrown out of Flight 232 on impact, and though he
remembers almost nothing between then and the hospital, the moments
before the crash remain hauntingly vivid.
   ``The girl next to me and I talked about how everything was
going to be OK. We planned how we would exit. I told her if the
plane filled up with smoke she should grab onto my belt. ...''
   The girl died.

   Mary Kahl doesn't remember the final moments before the crash.
But the tragedy turned her life upside down.
   ``It took me at least six months before I was able to get back
to my normal frame of thinking. I found it very difficult handling
my job,'' says Mrs. Kahl, a teacher, who with her husband, James,
and son, Jimmy, 15, all survived. They live in North Huntingdon, Pa.
   Her son refuses to talk about the crash.
   ``I still think we have some problems looming here,'' she says.
She, too, has had trouble discussing it.
   ``It's hard to go back and think about what happened to all
those people. We are the lucky ones. We don't have the physical
scars to deal with. There are a lot of people out there with a lot
more pain than what we're suffering.''
   ``Every time I hear about a plane crashing or a plane in trouble
landing, even trains bother me ... it just seems like a feeling of
terror that comes over you,'' she says.

   Ronald Rohde says every day since last July 19 is a gift.
   ``By all rights, I should have been dead almost a year ago,''
says the 40-year-old veterinarian from Marysville, Ohio. ``It's
easier to find the silver lining in the clouds now. Life's
irritations are a little easier to shrug off. What's there to get
worked up about when you could be upside down in a burning airplane?
   ``Every time the sun comes up, I think how lucky I am to be able
to see it,'' says Rodhe.
   Now, when he flies, ``I look at the stewardesses and I look at
the pilots and I wonder if it came crunch time if they would
perform as well as the captain and flight crew on Flight 232.''
   His two children worry, saying: ``You're not flying on a DC-10?
Your plane better not crash.' I say, `They usually don't.' ''

   Clifton Marshall, 45, of Ostrander, Ohio, works with Rohde and
was with him on Flight 232. In the last moments before the crash,
he wrote a goodbye letter to his family. Today he has no angry
words, no hostile feelings.
   ``There are people who think all of the risks should be covered.
They're more inclined to think that the world should be risk-free.
That ain't the way that it is. ... I take bigger risks every day
riding my bicycle to work,'' says Marshall.

   Bruce Benham believes that walking away from Flight 232 was the
second of two deliverances he's had in life. The first was his
recovery from thyroid cancer in 1985.
   Now, after the crash, he's found a new appreciation for life.
   ``The first time I went skiing last winter the mountains and the
snow seemed more beautiful. There is a certain exhilaration in
surviving,'' the 38-year-old Denver restaurant executive says.
   ``I've become very health and safety conscious because the crash
heightened my concern about not being here forever. I've lost 25
pounds in the last six months and I worked at it.''

   William Robertson has composed a list of accomplishments and
things he still wants to do in life. He already has checked off one
item on his wish list: hot-air ballooning.
   The 48-year-old Amoco executive from Wheaton, Ill., has set a
goal of visiting 20 to 25 foreign counties in the next 10 years and
has shifted his priorities.
   ``I give more time to my family and friends and people I care
about. In many cases, I'm more selfish with whom I choose to spend

   Upton Rehnberg's frequent pains in his right hip are a physical
reminder.
   There are emotional ones, too.
   ``I was (recently) talking to somebody about the crash, all of a
sudden I was crying. ... It suddenly brought back a lot of the
emotions that I felt.''
   Rehnberg, who works for Sundstrand Corp., a manufacturer of
aircraft components, suffered facial and arm burns when a fireball
swept into the plane. He didn't return to his job until December,
and hasn't been back on a DC-10.
   ``I'm working at becoming less of a workaholic. I'm spending a
lot more time outdoors.''
   Rehnberg, who lives in Rockford, Ill., also is struggling with
another personal change _ divorce, which, he says, his wife partly
attributes to consequences of the crash.
   The last year has been one of ``incredible turmoil, both
externally and internally. ... This is just the beginning of a
cycle of many, many changes. My life is never going to be the
same.''

   Jerry Schemmel has stayed in touch with the family of 1-year-old
Sabrina Michaelson, the girl he ran back inside the burning plane
to save.
   Sabrina, of West Chester, Ohio, had been thrown through the air
and separated from her mother, father and two brothers. Her cries
caught Schemmel's ear as he fled.
   ``I was tested a little bit, so that has made me feel better. If
I'd heard the crying and not gone back into the plane I would have
had terrible guilt feelings. But you'd be surprised how many people
would have done what I did,'' says Schemmel, 30, of Denver.
   In the past year, Lori Michaelson, 36, has turned from survivor
to crusader _ lobbying for mandatory infant seats on planes.
   ``I'm trying just to go on. ... Instead of going overboard and
spoiling your kids, you try not to overcompensate in your life. ...
   ``You try to consciously focus on each day and realize how out
of control your life is ... how rapidly things can change. You
think you're creating your own destiny in your life and you're
not,'' the mother of three says.
   Major disasters rehash all the hurt, she says. And even normal
child's play can cause problems.
   ``The oddest things come out,'' she says. A child brought over a
cap gun once and her son, Andrew, ``got really upset. He didn't
want him to use it. It smelled like a burning airplane.''
   And 23-month-old Sabrina?
   ``She's learned to talk ... and started walking. She has been
running ever since.''

   There have been big changes _ DC-10s
have been modified. There have been small developments _ infant
seats soon may be mandated for the airlines' littlest passengers.
   Much has happened in the year since United Flight 232 came to a
fiery, cartwheeling end in Sioux City, killing 112, but one thing
is unchanged: Heroes still are unwilling to take credit for valiant
acts that saved 184 lives.
   Capt. Al C. Haynes, who with his crew and the help of another
United pilot on board struggled for nearly 45 minutes to control
the balky jumbo jet, is refusing requests for interviews. Haynes,
who has returned to flying, gets notes from passengers on almost
every flight now.
   ``He takes it in good stride. He doesn't want to be seen as a
hero. It was a team effort,'' said United spokesman Rob Doughty.
   Three of four members of the cockpit crew, including Haynes, are
back in the air, as are seven of the eight surviving flight
attendants.
   Firefighters, emergency medical technicians, doctors, nurses and
the townspeople of Sioux City, lauded for their response to the
crash, its victims and survivors, say enough has been said.
   ``There are no heroes,'' said Shirley Brown, Sioux City's
assistant city manager. ``The people genuinely believe that they
just did their jobs that day. They did them well, they were
coordinated and they had rehearsed, but they simply did what they
had practiced.
   ``What we're hearing from people is, enough is enough.''
   Accolades keep coming. More than 100 communities have requested
copies of Sioux City's disaster preparedness plan, Ms. Brown said.
   ``For us, it was our job,'' said Terry Schmidt, training officer
for the Sioux City Fire Department. ``But the community, it wasn't
their job. It was just the right thing to do. We're kind of proud
of that.''
   A reunion of passengers, crew and rescuers is scheduled for
Thursday, the anniversary of the crash; a memorial has been
commissioned for those who died.
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board has proposed
something of a living memorial _ it has recommended infant safety
seats be required on airliners.
   The Association of Flight Attendants has said one of the
victims, 23-month-old Evan Tsau, of Albuquerque, N.M., might have
lived if the crash had not wrenched him away from his mother, who
survived.
   There are countless other reminders of the disaster, from the
nightmares of the survivors to the balance sheets of United's
insurance carrier, which has paid an average of about $45,000 in
damage settlements to more than 40 passengers or to estates of
passengers who died.
   Dozens of other passengers have sued, saying they want a jury to
determine damages, and others are seeking punitive damages against
the airline, the airplane manufacturer and engine manufacturer. No
trials are scheduled.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has not issued its
official report on the crash, but NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz
said the titanium fan disk in the rear engine separated, throwing
engine parts like shrapnel through the tail assembly and severing
all three independent hydraulic systems.
   Since the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered
a new kind of engine inspection in hopes of detecting flaws in the
titanium disk.
   The inspection has not revealed any more flaws, although six
disks made from the same titanium billet have been removed from
service.
   All of the General Electric-built engines were given on-wing
inspections. Before the end of this year, all engines must be
removed and disks placed in a water bath for separate ultrasonic
inspections.
   ``Of the 287 (domestic) jets, there are 31 disks that have yet
to be inspected in what we call the immersion tests,'' said Bob
Guyotte of the FAA's regional office in Burlington, Mass. None has
failed to pass, he said.
   But the NTSB isn't so sure. On June 18, it urged the FAA to
order yet another test in which electrical current is used to
detect cracks. United Air Lines already is using the method every
time it inspects disks on its fleet.
   By July 20, 1991 _ two years and a day after the crash _
domestic carriers must install devices to prevent a catastrophic
loss of hydraulic fluid in the No. 3 hydraulic system, the FAA has
ruled.
   Should the valve kick in, pilots would lose control of the
rudder and the elevators, but pilots still would be able to operate
all wing controls and to control the angle at which the plane
enters the air stream.
   ``It was tested in a simulator and then actually installed in an
aircraft and flight-tested. It was found to work very well,'' said
McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Elaine Bendel.
   Without those controls, Flight 232 couldn't be steered to a
runway and was flying at least 60 mph faster than a normal
approach. Haynes accelerated his remaining wing engines to guide
the crippled plane to Sioux City.
   The company has sent 84 repair kits to 14 customers worldwide so
far, Ms. Bendel said. A total of 428 DC-10s still are active
worldwide. United has 55 DC-10s and has installed the devices _ at
an estimated cost of $37,800 per plane _ in about half of them.
   Still, the debate continues on the safety of the DC-10. John
Galipault, president of Aviation Safety Institute of Worthington,
Ohio, said, ``It's probably got the worst safety record of all the
wide-bodies.''
   Using figures compiled by the Aviation Information Services
Limited of London, Galipault said 17 DC-10s have been lost over the
years, twice the rate for Boeing 747s and Lockheed L-1011s.
Comparisons on fatalities per million flight hours also are not
favorable for the DC-10, he said, with 74 for that airplane, 66 for
the Lockheed plane and 61 for Boeing's.
   Ms. Bendel blamed hangar fires, terrorist attacks and other
causes for the 17 lost airplanes, saying they had nothing to do
with the design of the plane. Galipault ``has a personal vendetta
against the DC-10, for whatever reason,'' she said.
   In the 45 days after the crash, only 400 of some 1.8 million
United passengers asked to steer away from DC-10s. But McDonnell
Douglas no longer makes the plane; the last one was delivered a
week after the crash, and the company is concentrating its efforts
on a replacement, the MD-11.
   There still are plenty of DC-10s in the air, but there is no
United Flight 232.
   As is the industry custom after a serious accident, United
changed the number on its afternoon flight from Denver to Chicago.

<HEAD>Star Watch: From Hunk to Ghost</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now you see him, now you don't. Patrick
Swayze, that ``Dirty Dancing'' man, takes a breather from his hunk
image by playing a ghost in a new romantic fantasy.
   Well, you do catch a look at the Swayze physique in the early
scenes of Paramount Picture's ``Ghost.'' But then he is murdered
and for the rest of the movie he struggles to communicate to his
fiance, Demi Moore, that she is also in danger. He finds a
go-between in a wacky medium, Whoopi Goldberg.
   ``I had to fight for the role,'' Swayze says. ``The director,
Jerry Zucker, wanted Kevin Kline. When he heard about me wanting
it, he said, `Over my dead body will Patrick Swayze play this role.'
   ``They said, `We're not going to offer you the film; you'll have
to come in and read.' I said, `OK, fine.' I went in and did six
scenes. By the time I was finished, I had the role.
   ``Have I auditioned before? Forever. When you get to this point
(in a career) you don't often have to audition. But I sort of feel
what is the point of all these years of study if you're afraid to
audition?''
   Swayze, who at 37 has the build of a college athlete, explained
that he fought for the role because of Bruce Joel Robin's script.
``It made me cry four or five times.'' But after he won the role,
he realized the hazard of playing a ghost.
   ``Sam was not a real easy character to do. He read beautifully
on the page, but when you start playing it, you realize he's left
out in the cold a little bit. In a five- or eight-page scene, it
would only deal with the characters who are living. The ghost would
be standing in a corner, and the stage directions would be: `Sam
watches.' `Sam horrified.' `Sam devastated.' `Sam growing in anger.'
   ``How do you play that kind of stuff? What I wanted to do was
establish a progression while he has a hard time remembering he's a
ghost. The process (of portraying a ghost) was interesting. It was
like being Roger Rabbit and working without actors against a blue
screen,'' he said.
   Why was he so eager for ``Ghost''?
   ``Because I had done two action movies (`Road House,' `Next of
Kin'). If I didn't want to be the `action dude,' then I had to go a
different direction.''
   More than most of today's film stars, Swayze seems concerned
about how fame affects his own stability and well being. That was
part of his motivation to campaign for ``Ghost''
   ``At that time the celebrity stuff was like blowing my mind a
little bit,'' he said. ``No matter how much you prepare yourself
for this `stardom stuff,' I don't think you really can until it
happens.
   ``I had been dealing with it for quite a while, after `The
Outsiders,' then `Red Dawn,' and especially (the miniseries) `North
and South' _ that sort of blew the lid off my life, worldwide.
`Dirty Dancing'? I don't even know how to catagorize that.
   ``I felt I needed something for my insides. I needed a movie I
could feel proud of promoting in the press. One that I didn't have
to make excuses for because of violence or something like that. Or
showing that no, I'm not really the dance guy; I really can act.
`Ghosts' just filled the bill.''
   Patrick Swayze grew up angry in Texas, venting his fury on the
football field and in street brawls. His life swerved when he
studied and danced with the Feld, Joffrey and Harkness ballets in
New York. A succession of injuries forced him in 1978 to try his
luck with acting in Los Angeles. Two years later he clicked in a
modest film, ``Skatetown USA.'' It was his first brush with fame.
   ``The film was a piece of _ fluff, but I was reviewed well,'' he
recalled. ``I had a lot of pictures offered to me, and I turned
them all down. I didn't want to be a teen idol.
   ``Stuff started happening to me that I didn't know. The
insidious stuff that wants to take over. Your insides start to
check out and go 100,000 miles away and you don't know it. It can
permeate your whole being before you're even conscious of what's
going on. That's what's killed a lot of people.
   ``I knew something was going on. Lisa (his wife) knew something
was going on. She was freaking out because she knew something bad
was happening and I was going to be mentally lonely. ... Rather
than not deal with it, we just kept talking about it, bringing it
out in the open, discussing what the feelings were. I feel like I
passed a place that a lot of people don't survive.
   ``Tom Cruise is facing it now, and I'm really happy that he
seems to be handling it.''
   Patrick and Lisa _ she is also a former dancer _ have found
their own escape, a horse ranch up north. But he adds: ``You got to
be careful with that, too. When you become too reclusive, you stop
living life with real people. As George C. Scott says, the first
thing that's robbed from you as an actor is your ability to observe
other human beings; they're all looking at you and not being
themselves.
   ``So Lisa and I surround ourselves with people who are not
yes-men, who challenge us, who may be better than us. We try to
keep moving forward.''

   The look of the Wheeling Symphony
Orchestra strikes a distinctive chord, but its improved sound
proves that classical music can have no sex.
   Its conductor for more than four years, Rachael Worby, is one of
few women comma
   ``It's kind of like having a handful of electricity,'' said Ron
Hobbs, a Wheeling Symphony Orchestra director. ``She has that sense
of excitement that is around her all the time.''
 nding the baton.  ``We don't consider her a female conductor. She's a
conductor
with talent who just happens to be female,'' said Agnes
Eisenberger, her agent. ``She caught our attention primarily
because of her talent and ability to get her musical message
across.''
   Worby, 41, also has caught the renewed attention of West
Virginia when she was publicly courted by Gov. Gaston Caperton.
They married on May 25.
   But long before she became West Virginia's first lady, she
helped double the Wheeling orchestra's budget and nearly triple its
season ticket sales in the same theater that is home to country
music's ``Jamboree USA'' radio program.
   She also is music director of the Young People's Concerts at
Carnegie Hall, one of Lalent teaching
children about music as ``exceptional.''
   At one session with a group of children, ``it was almost like
they were watching a magician,'' Hobbs said.
   Symphony members agree.
   ``A lot of conductors tend to keep a lot of distance between
themselves and their orchestra members. It's kind of the old
European style of dictator and peon,'' said Larry Bradford, viola
principal. ``She's not like that at all.''
   ``She can be your friend off the podium,'' said Carolyn Wann,
Wheeling's associate concertmaster.
   Worby's love for music stems from a childhood in Nyack, N.Y.,
filled with culture and music and an idolatry of Bernstein.
   ``Here was a man who was conducting Brahms at Lincoln Center,
writing `West Side Story' and conducting the Young People's
Concerts at Carnegie Hall,'' Worby said. ``He couldn't be
pigeon-holed. He was whatever he wanted to be. He was eclectic in
his musical tastes and, in addition to that ... he really stands by
his principles.''
   Worby, who has been called ``sort of a female Leonard
Bernstein,'' also is musically eclectic. She loves country music
and was the lead singer in Ragnarock and the Fly Boys, a rock group.
   She was the product of two sets of grandparents dramatically
different in style, but equally committed to music and the arts.
   ``When my mother's parents wanted to do something with me very
special they took me to `The Threepenny Opera.' I was 9, maybe 10,
maybe younger. When my father's parents wanted to take me some
place special, they took me to Radio City Music Hall to see the
Rockettes.''
   Her father, a hardware manufacturer, can't read music. But Louis
Worby can sing and he plays piano from the letters written above
notes in music books.
   ``There wasn't a night when my father wouldn't go after dinner
to sit at the piano and sing _ Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Irving
Berlin,'' Worby said. ``He would teach me very simple melodies ...
and we would sing it over and over again and suddenly he would
start singing harmony.''
   Her maternal grandfather also sang to her, but in a different
way.
   ``I very clearly remember my grandfather had a red wheelbarrow
which he would put me in and wheel me around in a small wooded area
in the back of the house,'' she said.
   ``While he was wheeling me around he would hum melodies of
Brahms symphonies to me with his Russian accent. In English, if
you're humming it's `la la lah, la la lah.' My grandfather, it was
`Tee rah ruhmmmm, Tee rah ruhmmmm.'''
   Worby credits her mother, who has perfect pitch, with literally
devoting a decade of her life to teaching her discipline.
   Diana Worby, a literature professor, agreed her daughter was
less than enthusiastic at times. ``When she was 8, 10, 12 and
supposed to be practicing piano she was the same as every other
kid. `I don't want to practice. I don't want to practice,''' Diana
Worby said.
   ``Before it seemed like every concert when she was supposed to
perform ... something generally happened. She got a fever or
sprained her thumb playing softball.''
   Her mother's discipline helped Worby through her formal music
education, a bachelor's degree from the State University of New
York at Potsdam, graduate work at Indiana University and a
doctorate in musicology from Brandeis University.
   It also shows in her work now.
   ``She's really studying a lot. Many conductors get to the midway
point in their careers and they stop learning from other
conductors, other orchestras, other approaches,'' Bradford said.
   ``It takes time, it takes years (to peak),'' said Milutin
Lazich, a bass singer who recently performed Mozart's ``Requiem''
under Worby's direction. ``There is unused potential there still.''
   Worby's concern is to keep learning.
   ``I'm a student. I won't be happy until I have a sense that I
have absorbed everything there is to absorb,'' Worby said. ``When
would I be finished studying Beethoven's Fifth Symphony? It's such
a humbling experience to even say it: Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
In the face of it, I'm still an infant.''
   Worby, however, hasn't lost sight of her goal to be conductor of
the greatest orchestra she can possibly lead.
   ``I feel inside of me an inexorable forward motion,'' she said.
``I'll know where the resting place is.''

   Christine McVie was concerned about the new
Fleetwood Mac album. Everyone was getting along so well, but all
the songs seemed so sad. Something had to be done.
   ``Everything was getting to the point of where it was a downer
album,'' explained the singer and keyboardist, who dashed off the
upbeat ``Skies the Limit,'' with its vow: ``The sky is the limit
now. We can hit it on the nail.'' ``It sounded like this was a
potential suicide band, which it wasn't. I decided to write a song
that was really up, it was a rally song.''
   That's about all the drama involved with ``Behind the Mask,'' a
letdown, perhaps, to fans used to the breakups, freakouts and
dropouts of the band's 23 years. All the heartbreak of this album
is on the album, like the title track, written by McVie, or Stevie
Nicks' ``The Second Time.''
   This is Fleetwood Mac, Phase IV, an easy-going combination of
Phases I through III. The current lineup: original members John
McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums; Christine, who joined in
1970; Nicks, a member of the class of '74, and new guitarists Billy
Burnette and Rick Vito, replacements for Lindsey Buckingham.
   And the band's getting all just fine, Christine insists. Life
has become as dramatic as an outdoor barbecue, finally living up to
Fleetwood Mac's sound of endless summer.
   ``It was actually a joyous year. There were times when we
thought that we had to be unhappy to do well, but that's a
fantasy,'' she insisted in a telephone interview from her home in
Los Angeles.
   ```Rumours' was made under great duress, with huge emotional
problems all over the place,'' said McVie, referring to the
best-selling 1977 album recorded while two marriages in the band
were breaking up.
   ``That's not the ideal recording situation or the ideal writing
situation. I don't write great songs when I'm miserable. I don't
write when I'm miserable.''
   Pop with a twist has long been the secret for Fleetwood Mac,
authors of ``Go Your Own Way,'' a good old-fashioned rock 'n' roll
divorce song, and ``Tusk,'' which introduced radio to the tribal
beat of tissue boxes.
   Then there's ``Hold Me,'' a hit single in 1982. As written by
McVie, it's a pretty mid-tempo ballad, with some neat lyrics _
``slip your hand inside my glove'' _ and a nice, fluid rhythm track
pushing the song along.
   But then Buckingham steps in for a little ``additional
engineering,'' the kind that caused three-year waits between albums.
   Harmonies rush in and out like the waves of the Pacific, McVie's
voice almost lost underneath. A harpsichord jangles in the
background. Two lead guitars are used during the break. The sound
of a strummed acoustic guitar pops up and quickly disappears.
Tuning and studio distortion make the plucking of strings from
another guitar sound like a broken cuckoo clock.
   ``It would be trial and error with Lindsey,'' McVie said. ``He
would take a song and treat it like a huge canvas, an oil painting.
He would put down something he thought was good, start to erase
things and paint it blue. It would sound nothing like the original.
   ``But I was always close behind Lindsey's back. I'm something of
a studio junkie myself. I learned a lot from Lindsey and tried to
carry it on into this album, trying to make sure that everything
fit.
   McVie has bailed out the band before. In 1970, guitarist Peter
Green, a founding member, quit the then-British blues group a month
before they were to begin an American tour. McVie, who had given up
a promising singing career to keep house, was hastily recruited.
   ``I thought the whole thing was really bizarre when I was asked
to join,'' she recalled. ``I had been a big fan of Fleetwood Mac
with Peter Green and (guitarist) Jeremy Spencer. On my night off,
I'd go to see Fleetwood Mac and ending up dating John.
   ``We were all living in the same house. We were all very much
like a family, tie-dyed T-shirts, smoking pot. After rehearsing on
the road, the band decided it wanted to augment the sound with a
keyboard. Since I was there, they just turned around and said,
`Chris, you come along.'''
   Four years later, it was McVie's turn to make room for new
faces. In 1971, Spencer disappeared for five days before the band
discovered he had joined a California sect called Cult of God.
Spencer's replacement, Bob Welch, quit the band. Another guitarist,
Danny Kirwan, was fired.
   Reduced to just the two McVies and Fleetwood, the band took a
chance on an obscure California husband-and-wife team with an album
called ``Buckingham Nicks.'' Christine quickly gave them a tryout.
   ``That was the biggest thrill of my life,'' McVie recalled of
their first meeting. ``I had written `Say You Love Me.' I sang the
chorus to them and, immediately, Stevie and Lindsey came to me with
these amazing harmonies. I remember getting these chills inside.
   ``We immediately liked them both and they liked us. We were all
very close. We socialized a lot at the beginning, did the old
Mexican food runs. I shared an apartment with Stevie for a while.
We're more like family now than friends, We get together for
holidays or I'll have a party at my house.''
   That hardly sounds like a group ready to split. Nicks, who has
made several solo albums, was once considered the most likely to
leave, but now swears she's in for keeps. Fleetwood and John McVie
aren't going anywhere, they're best friends and it's really their
group. Vito and Burnette are just starting out, still grateful to
be included.
   So, half relieved, half disappointed, Christine says the
long-expected breakup will never come, and wonders how life with
this ever-changing band could become so stable, so comfortable.
   ``It seems to be like we've grown roots, like big old oak
trees,'' she laughed. ``Maybe we should chop it down or it's going
to keep growing.
   ``We'll never really stop playing with each other unless we
really couldn't stand up anymore. We've barely scratched what we're
capable of doing.''

   Dennis McFarland knows a lot about quitting.
   He studied music, but gave it up: stage fright. Then came
writing _ novels. He'd stop cold at page 45. He even tried real
estate, hated it, and left six months later.
   Wary of becoming ``legitimate,'' he again took up writing. But
how long can a husband and father, way past 21, tell people he's
still finding himself, still trying to get that first book
published.
   So when McFarland started on a new novel, centered on a man
whose brother commits suicide, the author decided this was one
project he had to complete.
   ``It's sort of like you're doing something in the dark. I
believed in myself and my wife believed, but it didn't seem that
anybody else would be affected if I quit writing,'' said McFarland,
41, whose novel is called ``The Music Room'' (Houghton Mifflin,
$19.95).
   ``I had quit on everything else; I always thought that something
had happened to me in the middle. But with this book I decided no
matter what else happens, I was going to keep on. And rejection
after rejection, I kept on writing.''
   ``The Music Room'' begins with Martin Lambert learning that his
25-year-old brother, Perry, has jumped from the window of a
Manhattan hotel room. Martin, 29, flies in from San Francisco to
find out what happened, falls in love with Perry's old girlfriend,
Jane Owlcaster, and discovers he knew little about his brother's
life.
   Now on the surface this has little to do with McFarland. A
native of Mobile, Ala., he never had a brother commit suicide. He
did not come from a musical family, unlike the one in the novel,
nor were his parents alcoholics. The room that gives the book its
title is vividly described, but also does not really exist.
   But this is a story about quitting. Jobs. Marriages. Life
itself. Martin, like McFarland, has a history of unfinished
business. He's disconnected, easily distracted. When Martin
receives the call about his brother's death, he puts the detective
on hold, moves the French windows that overlook his garden and
watches a hummingbird dart outside.
   Later, lying in bed next to Perry's girlfriend, Martin thinks
about the early deaths of his brother and father, killed by
alcoholism at age 42.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``When I closed my own eyes, I thought at once of Perry, of how,
despite his drive to succeed, despite his apparent self-possession,
he had been, in his own way, lost. And then I thought how surely
the whole family was lost .... And father was lost to himself as he
groped his way towards his absurd early death. How often he would
open the door to a room, surprised to find us there _ `Oh, I'm
sorry, boys, I was looking for the ... ' _ a stray in his own
home.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Another link between author and subject. Martin is in his late
20s, and realizes he's unhappy, selling his San Francisco record
company to start a new life in New York. McFarland remembers his
late 20s as a time when he hated his life, ``hated getting up.'' He
had given up on music, sharing Martin's distaste for a career of
``teaching ear training to a bunch of college students.''
   ``I realized that even I became one of the most successful
people in the field, composing or performing, maybe there's 100
people who would care,'' said McFarland, who studied music at
Brooklyn College and now lives outside of Boston.
   ``It was so esoteric. I decided I would like a larger audience
if I was going to do something artistic.''
   Martin, drinking heavily, accuses Jane of hiding information
about the suicide. Frightened, aware that ``full-blown sorrow over
his death, still brewing at sea, had not yet reached shore,'' he
escapes to his mother's house in Norfolk, Va.
   One day, walking in the fields on a warm autumn afternoon, he
has a vision, ``the kind of vision that is the brutal side of
grief: the vision of an impossible future.''
   He pictures a celebration, a birthday party for his father. It's
late summer and both parents are sober. Perry is alive and happy,
playing backgammon with his mother, Jane resting her hands on his
shoulders. Their children are running by the water.

   ``... as the squeals of the children fleeing the cool surf and
the laughter attending the backgammon game reach my ears,'' thinks
Martin, ``I am filled with the faith and quiet confidence that
belongs to those who were given the heart and willingness to
survive, to those given the great fortune to have continued.''

   Imagine those words as something McFarland said to himself, at
one of the many times he was ready to give up the novel and perhaps
take another look at selling houses. That's why ``The Music Room''
is a personal novel, regardless of how different his life is from
Martin's. And that's why the author saw no other way to end the
story than to make sure his character lived.
   ``Either you die or you start to go back up,'' McFarland
observed. ``I probably will never write the book where it ends with
the person hitting bottom and staying there. That's just not what I
want my vision to be.
   ``I believe that enormous grief and enormous loss are
survivable. That's the greatest story for me.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Dan Seals Doesn't Sleep Under a Piano Anymore</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   There was a time when Dan Seals slept
under a grand piano at a recording studio at night, trying to
survive after going bankrupt.
   But things are a lot better for the country star who grew to
fame in the 1970s as England Dan of the pop duo England Dan and
John Ford Coley. What helped turn around his career was the
award-winning ``Bop'' in 1986.
   Nine of his last 10 single releases have reached No. 1 on the
country music charts, most recently ``Love on Arrival'' in April.
   But 10 years ago the 42-year-old Seals was in dire straits,
financially, as the result of what he calls an oversight by a
business associate. An accountant had neglected to pay the
employer's share of federal taxes involving employees Seals had on
his payroll.
   ``They (the IRS) came and got it all: cars, record royalties,
everything,'' Seals recalled. ``I didn't have any place to go, so I
just stayed at the studio under the grand. I remember sitting
around wondering how we'd get the money for a hamburger because
we'd used up everything we had. I figured I'd get a job at a
filling station.''
   Pumping gas wasn't necessary. His solo career took off shortly
thereafter, and Seals has been one of the steadiest country music
singers since his first No. 1 country hit, ``Everybody's Dream
Girl,'' in 1983.
   His music ranges from frisky tunes, such as ``Bop,'' to the
wistful affection in ``My Old Yellow Car'' and weepers such as
``Everything That Glitters.''
   His well-crafted songs tend to be insightful and graphic with
lofty themes. His instrumentation can be adventurous: He used horns
_ not often heard in country music _ on his current album, ``On
Arrival.''
   He also was daring last year in his music video, ``Rage On,''
when he addressed a topic rare in country music: an interracial
relationship. It showed angry youths smashing the windows of the
car of a young man dating an Oriental girl. One boy hurled a beer
bottle at the girl's father.
   The song itself was about small town values.
   ``When we record songs, we take chances,'' the soft-spoken Seals
said in an interview. ``I've got to the point where we are
stretching and trying new things. Not to shock, but just to keep
ourselves alive and interested. We feel we are on the cutting edge
of what we can do.''
   Seals said the video was a reflection of his Bahai religious
beliefs.
   ``I believe mankind is one family and that all religions are
one,'' he said.
   He and Coley had the pop hit ``I'd Really Love to See You
Tonight,'' which sold 2 million records in 1976. They broke up in
1979 to pursue separate careers.
   ``He's an actor in Los Angeles now,'' Seals said. ``I'm real
proud for him.''
   Seals' older brother, Jim, was half of the pop duo Seals and
Crofts whose hits in the 1970s included ``Summer Breeze'' and
``Diamond Girl.'' Seals and Crofts are now putting together an
album as a follow up to their first tour in 10 years.
   Dan Seals, who grew up in Dallas, was surprised at the airplay
for ``Bop,'' which crossed over to the pop charts.
   ``I've had radio people tell me that when `Bop' was out they had
to hire people to handle calls to the station asking to hear it
because they didn't have time,'' he said. ``It was a big jazzercise
record and a big nightclub song for clubs to play when the band
took a break.
   ``I thought the song wouldn't do anything because the
synthesizers we used were too different. I was wrong, delighted I
was wrong.''
   His other hit records include ``Big Wheels in the Moonlight,''
``My Baby's Got Good Timing,'' ``You Still Love Me,'' ``I Will Be
There'' and ``Three Time Loser.'' He and Marie Osmond teamed up on
another No. 1 record, ``Meet Me in Montana.''
   His 1986 album, ``Won't Be Blue Aymore,'' was No. 1 and reached
gold status for selling 500,000 copies.
   In June, Seals was asked by the U.S. State Department to perform
in Sofia, Bulgaria, at an outdoor rally for democracy attended by
an audience estimated at 1.4 million. Pop singer Art Garfunkel also
sang.
   ``It was the most mind-boggling experience I've ever had,''
Seals said. ``People just went on into the distance. I've played
for 300,000 at a festival and you could have lost them in the first
few rows over there.
   ``There are no words to describe something like that.''

   The Lannan Foundation will open the galleries
of its new headquarters on July 10 with the first exhibition in Los
Angeles of work by the highly-regarded West German artist Gerhard
Richter.
   Featuring a selection of 15 figurative and five abstract
paintings produced by Richter in the past two years, this
presentation marks the inauguration of Lannan's multi-faceted
exhibition program. This exhibit will remain on view through Sept.
1.
   The centerpiece of the Richter show is ``18. Oktober 1977,'' a
set of 15 paintings produced by the artist in 1988 depicting events
associated with the imprisonment and controversial deaths of the
leaders of the German terrorist Red Army Faction group known as the
Baader-Meinhof gang.
   In conjunction with the exhibition, the Foundation is making
available for purchase an illustrated catalog, ``Gerhard Richter
1988@89,'' published by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam.

   The internationally acclaimed
Music-Theater Group celebrated its 20th summer season of presenting
innovative new music-theater at its home at Citizen's Hall with
perfomances that began July 5.
   The season kicked off with ``Love and Science,'' a scientist's
love story in the form of a contemporary opera. Co-produced with
the Seattle Repertory Theater, ``Love and Science'' has music
composed by Stanley Silverman and is written, directed and designed
by Richard Foreman. The production will run through July 28.
   ``Endangered Species'' marks its 11th year of a successful
collaboration between Martha Clarke and Music-Theater Group.
``Endangered Species'' deals not only with the bond between man,
animals and nature, but also the blind acts of dominance and
oppression that threatens the livelihood of all species. The
production will run in a tent on the grounds of Arrowhead, from
August 8-25.

<HEAD>All Nippon To Buy About 30 Passenger Jets Worth $3.3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All Nippon Airways Co. said Tuesday it plans to buy
about 30 medium-sized passenger aircraft for about $3.3 billion,
substantially increasing the fleet of Japan's second largest
carrier.
   The ANA official said a selection committee led by the company's
vice president, Keisuke Inui, will spend about three months
choosing the new passener aircraft among four candidates.
   They are: the B777, a high-technology passenger aircraft with a
seating capacity of 407 being developed jointly by Japan and the
United States; McDonnell-Douglas Corp.'s MD-11 with a seating
capacity of 380; and European Airbus Industrie's A330 with a
capacity of 385 and the A340 with a capacity of 262-295.
   ANA will introduce the new passenger planes starting in 1995
over a period of four to five years, the official, who asked not to
be named, said.
   The official said introduction of the new aircraft is aimed to
meet increasing passenger demand in the future, with planned
completion of three major airport construction projects in Japan by
the mid-1990s.
   Japan's first airport for 24-hour operation is being built on a
man-made island in Osaka Bay and is scheduled to open by 1993. Two
more runways will be added to an existing one at the New Tokyo
International Airport at Narita. Tokyo's Haneda Airport, used
mostly by domestic carriers, will be expanded to accommodate more
traffic.
   ANA, formerly limited to domestic routes, has expanded rapidly
in recent years since the Ministry of Transport permitted it to
begin competing on some international routes with rival Japan
Airlines.
   The company currently operates 105 aircraft, including 17
B747-100s, 25 B767-200s and 18 B767-300s. During 1988-89, ANA
ordered 20 A320 and 26 B747-400 jets, which are scheduled to begin
flying at the end of 1990.

   The business glossies are increasingly using an
old strategy to hook the listless reader.
   Fortune and Forbes began promoting their latest editions Monday
with the most elaborate lists yet of the world's biggest companies,
ranked in categories ranging from sales to pofits to nationality.
   Officials of the twice-monthly magazines, which both report
circulation in well in excess of 700,000, said the timing was
strictly coincidence. But it came a few days after Business Week,
the leading weekly business periodical with 980,000 circulation,
produced its own list of leading worldwide companies.
   ``The list phenomenon is certainly not new, it just seems like
it's reaching new heights or new lengths,'' said James Gentry,
director of the business journalism progam at the University of
Missouri School of Journalism.
   Part of the reason for the profusion of lists, he suggested, is
``not letting anybody one-up you. If Business Week designs
something, Fortune and Forbes will do something.''
   For the first time, Fortune produced the ``Fortune Global 500.''
The list of industrial companies replaced its ``International 500''
ranking of foreign concerns by combining that list and the
``Fortune 500'' list of biggest U.S. industrial companies, the
granddaddy of rankings first published in 1955.
   Fortune's new global list ranked General Motors Corp. as the
largest industrial concern, based on 1989 sales of $126.97 billion,
followed by Ford Motor Co. with sales of $96.93 billion and Exxon
Corp. at $86.66 billion.
   The highest-ranking foreign company was No. 4 Royal Dutch-Shell
Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil concern, at $85.53 billion.
   At the same time, Forbes released its annual ``Forbes
International 500,'' which ranked the size of big foreign companies
and put the Japanese trading giant Sumitomo Corp. first with 1989
sales of $158 billion.
   The Forbes list, dominated by Japanese companies, was
embellished by an ``International Super 50'' ranking, described as
the 50 most powerful foreign companies as measured by a mix of
sales, profits, assets and market value. The magazine included its
list of the world's billionaires in the same issue.
   ``We feel we do it best of all,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray
Healey. ``We just don't give them the companies. We give them the
billionaires that run these companies. We give people a complete
package. Our competitors give people a half package.''
   Not so, said Fortune Managing Editor Marshall Loeb, who called
his magazine's list the most informative, easiest to read and
up-to-date.
   ``I don't want to knock their list, I just want to talk about
our list,'' he said. ``It's the only one that presents the 500
industrial corporations in the whole world by gauging size, that
is, the sales of the company.''
   Fortune and Forbes have assembled increasingly elaborate lists
in recent years. Besides the wealthiest people and the biggest
companies, list topics have ranged from best cities for business to
highest-paid executives.
   Both magazines also have peddled their lists more aggressively
in advance of publication, not only as news events to attract
additional readers but as a selling point to potential advertisers.
   The Fortune list is in July 30 issues and the Forbes list is in
July 23 issues. Both were released several days in advance of their
appearance on newsstands.
   In the current climate of weak advertising revenue in the U.S.
magazine industry, the foreign-theme lists have taken on a more
important role for the business glossies. Foreign companies,
particularly from Japan, have enormous amounts of money to spend on
promotion and actively are sought as advertisers.
   The Fortune issue, for example, contains an 81-page special
advertising supplement on Japanese businesses. Magazine spokeswoman
Emma Dockendorff called it the single biggest special ad section in
the magazine's history. Forbes included a 16-page supplement on
U.S.-German business.

   Here are the top 10 entries in the biggest-company lists
released Monday by Fortune and Forbes.
   The Fortune list is a ranking of the world's 500 biggest
industrial corporations, by 1989 sales. The Forbes list ranks the
largest foreign public companies, also by 1989 sales. Each list was
accompanied by numerous sub-lists that rank companies by a range of
other criteria. Some companies on both lists have differing sales
figures because each magazine used different exchange-rate
calculations to determine the dollar equivalent.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Overhaul of Asbestos Payment Trust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to break a legal gridlock over
compensating victims of asbestos-related diseases, a federal judge
is seeking to consolidate tens of thousands of lawsuits into one
giant class action case.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein on Monday also ordered a
complete overhaul of the financially ailing Manville Corp. trust
fund created to compensate victims of diseases such as lung cancer
and mesothelioma.
   But Weinstein said the only possible solution to ``this
wasteful, inefficient war over asbestos'' may be to group all of
some 90,000 outstanding cases into one class-action lawsuit before
him.
   The judge asked lawyers for about 40 defendant companies and
thousands of victims exposed to asbestos on the job to agree on a
converting the cases. That would remove cases from the dockets of
500 state courts and all 96 federal courts.
   ``The courts ... are now so overloaded with drug cases and other
matters that the extra burden of asbestos litigation is seriously
interfering with the administration of justice in this country,''
Weinstein said.
   Consolidating the cases also would sharply reduce payments to
plaintiffs lawyers, who have received as much as 40 percent of
compensation payments to victims.
   Asbestos, a white mineral with natural heat-resistance and
insulation properties, was widely used in shipbuilding,
construction and other industries for decades. Lengthy exposure has
been found to cause cancer and other serious and often fatal
diseases.
   In his order, Weinstein also temporarily froze all payments by
the Manville trust, citing a ``severe cash shortage ...
constituting a judicial emergency.'' Included in the stay are
payments of any settlements, court judgments and legal fees.
Ongoing court cases are not affected.
   He ordered that the trust, created in 1988 as part of Manville
Corp.'s bankruptcy court reorganization, be restructured and
refinanced by Aug. 6 to allow quicker payments to the neediest
victims of asbestos-related disease.
   The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust is out of cash to
pay new claims and has said that people who file claims now may not
get paid until well into the 21st century.
   The cash shortage has been induced by more cases, larger payouts
and quicker settlements than expected. To date, the trust has paid
$974 million to settle more than 22,300 cases, an average payment
of about $43,000 per claim.
   Weinstein is involved in the asbestos saga because he is
supervising, along with a state judge, 579 cases consolidated for
trial involving former workers of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
   Weinstein called for a new method to compensate workers and
their families who were most seriously injured by asbestos diseases
and need money immediately. He supported installment payments to
victims to maximize the trust's available funds.
   ``Those workers and their families who were most seriously
injured must secure compensation immediately,'' Weinstein said.
   That would replace the system developed in bankruptcy court that
pays victims on the basis of when they file a claim rather than the
nature of their disease, one of the most highly criticized features
of the trust.
   On refinancing, Weinstein suggested several steps, including
hundreds of millions of dollars in loans or advances from Manville;
sale of control of Manville by transferring the trust's assets; or
the trust buying the entire company.
   As part of its Chapter 11 reorganization, Denver-based Manville
placed $2.5 billion in assets, mostly stock, into the trust. The
company also agreed to contribute $75 million annually starting in
1991 plus 20 percent of annual net income from 1992 until all
claims are paid. The trust effectively controls 80 percent of
Manville.
   Weinstein supported an injunction prohibiting asbestos victims
from directly suing Manville, a measure he hinted at recently,
because ``the value of the trust depends upon a healthy, viable
corporation.''
   David Austern, general counsel for the Washington-based trust,
said he would ask the trustees whether to object to the stay of
payments.
   According to court documents, the trust has on hand $93.2
million to pay $112.8 million in claims already settled. That money
is frozen by the judge's order.

<HEAD>Marlboro Maker Threatens Suits Against Trademark Use on Kid
Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics say the maker of Marlboro cigarettes is
blowing smoke with its new advertising campaign that warns candy,
toy and apparel manufacturers against using its trademarks on
products aimed at children.
   The campaign by Philip Morris USA, the nation's biggest
cigarette company, whose brands also include Virginia Slims, Benson
&amp; Hedges and Parliament, was disclosed Monday amid a crescendo of
health-related complaints against smoking.
   The critics said the move against unauthorized use of cigarette
brand logos on candy cigarettes and video games was a diversionary
tactic designed to distract attention from what they say are subtle
industry efforts to hook youngsters on tobacco.
   They also said the $500,000 Philip Morris pledged for the
five-year campaign pales next to what it spends promoting its
tobacco products.
   ``It's nothing but a PR effort,'' said Dr. John W. Richards,
president of Doctors Ought to Care, a physicians' group trying to
reduce teenage smoking.
   Anti-smoking forces have succeeded in getting smoking banned on
most domestic airline flights and in many public spaces and are
clamoring to extend a ban on broadcast advertising to print and
promotions such as sporting events.
   Critics also have accused the tobacco companies of marketing
their products to children or or tolerating others' use of
distinctive cigarette logos on products for youngsters.
   Tobacco companies vigorously have denied those charges, saying
their marketing efforts are aimed at adult smokers.
   But there have been embarrassing incidents in recent months. A
video game maker, for instance, used a version of the Marlboro logo
as part of the background for its racing game until it was
discovered and Philip Morris objected. Tobacco companies also
confirmed they once paid to have their products placed in movies
popular with teens.
   John R. Nelson, vice president of corporate affairs for Philip
Morris, told a news briefing on Monday that the company had taken
1,100 ``actions'' to stop unauthorized use of its cigarette logos
over the past decade, with about 10 percent of those cases
involving products aimed at children.
   But he said the company has been able to take those actions,
which range from letters by Philip Morris lawyers to lawsuits, only
after being notified that the logos are being used.
   He said the new ad campaign, starting in August in 16 journals
read widely by lawyers and those in the toy, candy, video and
apparel businesses, should make Philip Morris' position known in
advance of products hitting the market.
   The company has prepared two ads, each listing the company's
cigarette names and logos. One ad says ``Cigarettes Are Not for
Children!'' while the other says ``If You Use These Trademarks,
We'll See You in Court.''
   ``We don't want products created for kids carrying our logos,''
Nelson told reporters.
   Nelson defended the amount earmarked for the five-year campaign,
saying $500,000 was sufficient to reach through trade journals the
people making children's products.
   According to Leading National Advertisers, Philip Morris spent
$277.4 million on cigarette advertising in 1989. Others have
estimated the industry as a whole spends more than $3 billion a
year on all types of tobacco promotion.
   Nelson said there were no plans to beef up the company's
six-person trademark enforcement division to support the goals of
the new ad campaign but said that division has no budget cap on
what it may spend.
   He said the company decided last year it no longer would allow
use of its cigarettes in movies following controversies about
placing Marlboros in a ``Superman'' movie and Lark cigarettes in a
James Bond film.
   He said Philip Morris notified leading product placement
companies that it no longer will pay for such placements and would
deny permission if asked.
   But he added there was little the company could do to stop
incidental use of its brands in films.
   The new ad campaign won't quiet tobacco's critics.
   Joe Tye, president of a group called Stop Teenage Addiction to
Tobacco, said he doubts the industry wants to discourage young
people from smoking. He estimated people under 18 bought $1.25
billion in tobacco products last year.
   ``They are trying to come up with something to distract from
what they are really doing _ trying to get kids to smoke by
associating with it with athletics, excellence, independence,
maturity, good times and good fun,'' he said.

<HEAD>Survey Says Corporate Name Changes Fell Off in First Half</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foodmaker whose bananas were more familiar
than it was did it. So did a bedding company better known for a
mattress brand.
   An investment partnership with all too familiar name did it in
what appeared to be a chance to make people forget.
   They all changed their corporate names in the first half of the
year.
   United Brands Inc. became Chiquita Brands International Inc.,
Ohio Mattress Co. is now known as Sealy Corp. and Ivan Boesky &amp; Co.
LP became CX Partners LP.
   But despite these striking examples of new company calling
cards, a survey released Monday said the volume of corporate name
changes fell 9 percent in the first half of 1990 compared with a
year earlier.
   The consulting firm Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc. said the 697
corporate names changes in the first six months of 1990 was down
from 767 in the first half of 1989. It was the fewest changes for
the period since there were 579 in the first half of 1986.
   Joel Portugal, a principal in the identity consulting firm, said
the decline reflected an overall decline in general business
activity. First-half name changes peaked at 931 in early 1988.
   The latest drop-off occurred despite an increase in the number
of name changes stemming from mergers and acquisitions.
   That was the single biggest category of name change
explanations, totaling 367 changes, or 53 percent of the total,
compared with 351 a year earlier.
   Prominent among merger-related changes were 61 resulting from
government-assisted actions related to the thrift industry.
   Elective name changes accounted for another 125, down from 139 a
year earlier, while divestitures accounted for 93 changes, down
from 108.
   Elective changes included United Brands' change as well as the
switch of International Minerals and Chemical Corp. to Imcera Group
and AMCA International's change to United Dominion Industries.
   Other reasons included 44 due to sale of assets, 34 for
corporate restructuring, seven for changes to a holding company
configuration, eight for leveraged buyouts or spinoffs and 19 for
assorted other reasons.
   Portugal said companies have become more sophisticated in recent
years about name changes.
   He said two decades ago, executives often would change a
company's name in an effort ``to prime the pump'' and boost sales.
   But he said modern executives make changes ``for substance, not
appearances sake'' and said the falloff in name changes this year
may indicate that companies don't feel their business has changed
enough to warrant a switch.
   ``With less changes taking place in business, there is less
reason to communicate a change,'' he said.
   But he said some companies sought to disassociate themselves
from names that became infamous in the 1980s.
   In addition to the change at the investment firm headed by Ivan
Boesky, a central figure in Wall Street's biggest inside trading
case, Portugal noted that Campeau (U.S.) Corp. became Federated
Stores Inc. in the first half.
   In the face of financial problems, Portugal noted Campeau
changed its name ``to an already well-established and respected
name in the financial and retail communities.''

<HEAD>Contract Talks Between Eastern, Pilots Union at Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 30-day cooling-off period began today after
contract talks between Eastern Airlines and the Air Line Pilots
Association reached an impasse.
   The latest round of talks started in mid-May, several weeks
after a federal bankruptcy court in New York appointed Martin
Shugrue as a trustee to take control of Eastern from Frank Lorenzo.
Lorenzo is chairman of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., then
called Texas Air Corp., the parent of Eastern.
   After the 30-day period, the ALPA pilots could legally vote to
strike Miami-based Eastern. But such a move likely would have
little effect, since most of the 1,900 pilots at Eastern currently
are non-union.
   Flight attendants and ALPA pilots at Eastern walked out in
sympathy with the Machinists union in March 1989 but called off
their strikes last November.
   Most of the pilots were replaced by non-union hires and only a
few hundred ALPA fliers remained at Eastern through the strike or
later returned to work there. Many former Eastern pilots still are
out of work.
   An ALPA strike vote ``would be a non-event,'' Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Monday in Miami. She said the
company would work toward a negotiated settlement in the next 30
days.
   E.J. Breen, a member of the Master Executive Council of ALPA for
Eastern, acknowledged that a decision to strike wouldn't shut down
the airline. He warned, however, that it could hamper the carrier's
operations.
   An impasse was declared Monday after the talks in Washington
broke off in early in the day. The Master Executive Council
rejected what was described as the company's final contract offer.
A federal mediator proposed arbitration, a stronger measure than
mediation, but Eastern refused the offer _ setting in motion the
cooling-off period.
   Later, at a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland in New York, Eastern withdrew its earlier request to the
court to impose a new contract on the ALPA pilots.
   ``Eastern has consistently slammed every door in the pilots'
face,'' said John Mazor, an ALPA spokesman.
   In a statement, the pilots union called the contract terms
offered by the company ``onerous at best.'' The two sides also are
at loggerheads over the issue of non-working pilots returning to
Eastern and the order of preference they should be given in going
back.
   In addition, ALPA objects to Eastern's insistence that the
union's lawsuit against Continental Airlines Holdings be dropped as
a condition of reaching a labor agreement.
   ``When Martin Shugrue took over as trustee of Eastern, he said
that labor peace was essential to Eastern's survival,'' the ALPA
statement said. ``Apparently that was just a stalling tactic,
because what we're seeing is simply a continuation of the Lorenzo
approach to labor relations.''
   Nevertheless, the union said, it was prepared to continue
negotiations with the company throughout the cooling-off period.
   Eastern has been operating under bankruptcy court supervision
since March 9, 1989, five days after the start of the strike.

<HEAD>UAL Buyout Group Says 5 Banks Willing To Lend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s unions are still seeking financing
commitments for their proposed $4.38 billion acquisition of United
Airlines, although five major banks have expressed a willingness to
become the lead lenders.
   ``We are talking to a lot of people,'' a source close to the
labor group said. Those includes other banks and aircraft
suppliers, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The unions have disclosed the names of five major U.S. banks
that have indicated an interest in lending money for the deal. The
development advances the union group toward its goal of securing
financing for the buyout by an Aug. 9 deadline.
   But none of the banks has yet signed a loan agreement, and they
are insisting that a portion of the financing come from non-banking
sources such as aircraft suppliers, said the union group source.
   ``I'm not aware that anything has been signed,'' the source said
Monday. ``They have expressed a willingness to participate.''
   The five New York-based banks are Citicorp, Chase Manhattan
Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
and Chemical Banking Corp., United's pilots union said Saturday in
a tape-recorded telephone message to its members.
   The banks ``will be both participating in and leading the
syndication of the financing,'' according to the message.
   The unions need about $4.5 billion to complete the cash portion
of the $201-per-share buyout, refinance existing debt and provide
working capital for the airline.
   The five banks are expected each to offer about $500 million, or
a total of $2.5 billion.
   UAL's stock rose $4.37{ to $157.12{ Monday in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The buyout group, which includes United's pilots, machinists and
flight attendants, supplied the names of the banks to UAL's board
of directors last week in a progress report, the union source said.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the board pressed
the unions to provide evidence of progress after the unions asked
the board to hold off on placing a large order for new aicraft, a
request the board subsequently honored.
   The union source would say only that the unions supplied the
bank names to UAL's board after learning the board was readying the
jet order.
   The buyout group is talking with a variety of suppliers,
including aircraft manufacturer Boeing Corp. and jet engine maker
General Electric Co., about possibly investing in the buyout in
return for a note or nonvoting preferred stock in the airline.
   The union group also has named three people who would become
directors of an employee-owned UAL.
   They are Robert Lanigan, chairman of Owens-Illinois Inc.; J.
Richard Munro, chairman of the executive committee of Time Warner
Inc.; and Donald Perkins, a former chairman of Jewel Food Stores
Inc., a unit of American Superstores Inc.
   The board agreed in April to the buyout proposal, which would
make UAL the world's largest employee-owned company.
   Two of the banks named by the unions, Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan, were the lead banks in an earlier, failed buyout bid led
by UAL's management and pilots.
   That $6.75 billion deal collapsed in October, precipitating a
190-point plunge in the stock market, when other banks balked at
financing it partly because of opposition by United's machinists.

   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the first

currencies, says it will remain open 20{ hours to do more trading
in Pacific Rim countries.
   The new hours, an increase of 6{ hours, are longer than any

Monday.
   The Philadelphia exchange, the oldest in the country, is known
for the buying and selling of the Australian dollar, British pound,
Canadian dollar, German mark, European currency unit, French franc,
Japanese yen and Swiss franc for future delivery.
   The exchange is where trading in foreign currency options
originated; about 250 people now participate in that business.
   The only hours it will not conduct foreign currency trading are
from 2:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. EDT. During standard time, it will open
and close an hour earlier.
   The trading day for 1,800 stocks runs from 9:30 a.m. through 4
p.m., coinciding with the New York Stock Exchange, with an extra 10
or 15 minutes. for the 140 stock options and four index options it
handles.
   The Philadelphia Exchange in September 1987 became the first
U.S. securities organization to introduce evening hours for foreign

<HEAD>Judge Upholds State's Penny Stock Fraud Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that Georgia's penny
stock law _ considered the toughest in the nation _ is legal and
will not adversely affect legitimate brokers.
   In an order filed late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jack Camp
said the public interest in having a strong anti-fraud law
outweighed Pacific Southern Securities Inc.'s contention that it
would be irreparably harmed by the law.
   The company claimed that the law violated its constitutional
rights to due process, equal protection and commerce and that the
state law was pre-empted by federal legislation.
   Gerald Schechter, president of Colorado-based Pacific Southern,
had testified in a hearing last month that he could not do business
in Georgia under the law. Schechter said his firm has more than
1,200 Georgia customers.
   ``Regulating abuses in the penny stock industry is a legitimate
state government interest,'' Camp said in his order. ``Limiting the
effect of the regulations to firms that deal almost exclusively in
penny stocks is not an irrational or arbitrary exercise of
government power.''
   The new law, which went into effect July 1, includes several
provisions to protect investors, including a three-day ``cooling
off'' period during which deals to buy the stocks can be canceled.
   The law also requires dealers to undergo training to ensure they
know about what they are selling, and the secretary of state is
given increased power to impose penalties on violators, including
civil fines of up to $500,000 for each offense.
   The law passed the Legislature overwhelmingly following a series
of hearings, organized by Georgia Secretary of State Max Cleland,
where investors made allegations of widespread abuse in the penny
stock industry.
   Penny stocks are low-price, high-risk securities that
authorities say are easily subject to fraud. The securities are not
listed on stock exchanges, and reliable information on their value
is not readily available to investors.
   Federal officials say penny stock fraud causes investors to lose
$2 billion annually.
   ``The reason we have this law is because ... there were
significant abuses to the public,'' said George Shingler, of the
attorney general's office, who represented Cleland.

   The Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether Western Union filed false
financial reports in connection with its recapitalizatiion
registration.
   In an amendment to the registration filed Monday with the SEC,
Western Union said that on May 28, the commission ordered an
investigation of the period from April 1986 to March 1989. It said
the SEC had advised it of the investigation in September 1989.
   The federal agency said it was looking into whether Western
Union filed untrue or misleading reports or falsified books and
records.
   It also is investigating whether certain officers, directors or
other personnel made misleading statements about financial
statements or Western Union's financial condition; any plans or
proposals regarding the possible sale or divestiture of Western
Union's major assets; the company's accounting entries, procedures,

operations.
   In response, Western Union said it ``believes that its financial

in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that its public disclosures during this period were accurate in all
material respects.''
   ``Western Union cooperated fully with the commission in

<HEAD>Sony Regrets DAT Lawsuit After Worldwide Standards Worked Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. expressed regret today that it was being
sued for allegedly promoting illegal record copying after measures
had been worked out to limit the ability of new tape equipment to
make copies.
   At a meeting of the National Music Publishers Association in Los
Angeles Monday, it was announced that an estimated 45,000
songwriters had filed a class action lawsuit against Sony, claiming
its digital audio tape machines encouraged copyright violations.
   A Sony spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
company had not yet received official word from the U.S. Federal
Court in New York where the case had been filed, or from the
plaintiffs.
   But ``it didn't come as a surprise,'' the spokesman said, adding
that music copyright holders had indicated they might take legal
action aimed at preventing the new recording devices from going on
sale.
   Unlike current analog tape recording equipment, digital
technology provides for distortion-free recording of music from
compact discs, and of subsequent generations of DAT cassettes.
   The Sony spokesman said it was regrettable that the songwriters
should choose to sue just as the U.S. Congress was beginning to
debate legislation and after an international consensus had been
reached on preventing the new technology from violating musicians'
copyrights.
   Last summer, record and audio industry groups around the world
agreed on a worldwide standard for DAT equipment that clears the
way for widespread marketing but limits the machines' ability to
make repeated copies of CDs and other recorded material.
   They agreed that the machines would include a system that adds a
``flag'' signal to the tape when music from CDs is recorded to
prevent any additional copies being made.
   The Sony spokesman said the agreement had worked to the mutual
benefit of DAT manufacturers, record makers and consumers.
   ``It would be a disadvantage to U.S. consumers if it were taken
away,'' he said.
   Sony and its American affiliates, though not the only producers
of DAT technology, were the only firms named in the lawsuit. Sony
leads the field.
   Japanese companies, the principal makers of the new machines,
have sold DAT equipment in Japan and Europe since 1987. But they
had refrained from selling in the United States until last month
because of opposition by the U.S. record industry and a delay in
receiving permission from their own government.

<TEXT>
   Five semiconductor makers illegally are using a
process patented by Texas Instruments Inc. 13 years ago, the
company claims in complaints filed in court and with the
International Trade Commission.
   ``TI is taking these actions to prevent the unauthorized use of
its technology and protect the significant investments the company
has made in development of intellectual property that is used in
integrated circuits around the world,'' company general counsel
Richard J. Agnich said after Monday's filings.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District in Dallas, says Integrated
Device Technology Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif., Analog Devices Inc.
of Norwood, Mass.; Cypress Semiconductor Corp. and VLSI Technology
Inc., both of Sa Jose, Calif.; and LSI Logic Corp. of Milpitas,
Calif., are violating a 1977 patent. The suit asks for unspecified
damages.
   A companion complaint filed with the trade commission says the
five companies also are importing and selling semiconductors made
using the process without licensing.
   The actions are the latest in the Dallas-based company's
4-year-old campaign to benefit from its technological advances,
which are protected by more than 5,000 patents. Among the company's
breakthroughs was the invention of the computer chip in 1958.
   TI has earned $574 million in royalty income since 1987, when it
first challenged nine Asian companies for using the same process,
which involves covering computer chips with plastic.
   One of the accused companies suggested the lawsuit is a
farfetched bid to grab revenue.
   ``Texas Instruments has been demanding some incredibly high
royalty rates,'' said Jack Menache, general counsel at Integrated
Device Technology Inc. ``I guess they're not making any money from
operations.''
   Menache said officials of his company met with TI
representatives in December to discuss the patents, but no
negotiations have been held since.
   Menache said the process TI claims rights to ``a process that's
been around for a long, long time.''
   Officials at the other four companies said they would have no
immediate comment.
   A TI engineer is credited with co-inventing the integrated
circuit in 1958. Today, the company is the No. 2 U.S. manufacturer
of computer chips behind Motorola Inc.
   It wasn't until 1986, however, that the Dallas-based computer
company began enforcing patents. ``Prior to that you did not have a
legal system whose environment was that conducive to intellectual
property,'' said TI spokeswoman Terri West.
   ``In order to remain competitive, a company must receive a fair
return on a research and development investment and that means
protecting your intellectual property,'' she said.
   Most of the royalty income so far has come from the patent
covered in the lawsuits. In 1986, TI won claims that one Korean and
eight Japanese semiconductor manufacturers were illegally using the
process.
   In addition, TI last year won a Japanese patent on the 1958
integrated circuit. One estimate puts income from that patent as
high as $290 million in 1991 alone.
   In addition to the plastic-encapsulation patent, the lawsuit
claims the five companies are violating a related patent and that
VLSI and Cypress Semiconductor are violating two other patents.

<HEAD>UTC Plans Spaceport in Australia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. plans to build
and manage a commercial spaceport in northern Australia, a move
that would put the aerospace giant at the center of the emerging
international space-launch industry.
   The Bush administration gave informal approval Sunday to a plan
in which a UTC subsidiary, USBI Co. of Huntsville, Ala., will
design and develop the spaceport in Cape York, Australia. The base
will be used to launch U.S. satellites on Soviet-built Zenit
rockets for telecommunications customers worldwide.
   If completed, UTC's venture would represent the first time a
private company has built a spaceport. All previous spaceports have
been built by government military or space agencies.
   Bush administration officials delayed approval of the project
for more than a year as they weighed concerns about the transfer of
sensitive U.S. space technology to the Soviets.
   U.S. rocket makers such as Martin Marietta Corp. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. opposed the plan, fearing competition from
government-subsidized Soviet rockets.
   ``The delicate problem for the government was how to promote all
the sectors of the U.S. space industry _ the satellites, the
launchers and the launch complexes _ while recognizing we're in a
world market,'' said Joel Johnson, vice president for international
affairs at the Aerospace Industry Association in Washington.
   When USBI has received formal U.S. approval, it will begin
negotiating with the Australians on a final design of the
spaceport, said Don Mirth, a senior vice president at USBI.
   He said USBI expects to employ about 70 workers in the design
phase, about 300 to supervise construction of the spaceport and
about 200 to manage the launch facility when it begins operating in
the mid-1990s.

   A bill requiring the music industry to
label records with questionable lyrics, and not sell such records
to minors, may not be constitutional, Gov. Buddy Roemer said.
   Roemer said he favors warning labels for recordings with themes
of rape, murder, suicide, incest, illegal drug use, child abuse and
satanic worship, but would prefer that the industry adopt a
voluntary program.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would sign the
measure, which also bans the sale of labeled records to minors.
   Although the labeling bill passed both chambers of the
Legislature with more than the two-thirds vote needed to override a
veto, the legislative session ended Monday night and a veto would
kill it until the next session, which begins in April. Roemer has
20 days to decide on the bill after it reaches his desk.
   Roemer told a news conference Monday that serious legal
questions about the bill's constitutionality had to be balanced
against concerns about the content of some recordings.
   Most of the industry was acting responsibly, but ``some portions
of the industry produce pure trash,'' he said. ``Parents don't know
that until they are brought home and played.''
   Roemer said he preferred a voluntary program, similar to the
ratings system adopted by the movie industry.
   ``We'll all be better off,'' he said.
   Under the legislation, record manufacturers would be required to
label recordings with objectionable lyrics. Retailers would be
subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties for selling labeled
recordings to those under 17.
   In May, the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling
system aimed at halting state campaigns for mandatory labeling.
Industry spokesmen said every legislature except Louisiana's pulled
back their bills while the voluntary program was tested.
   The voluntary program went into effect this month, and labeled
recordings already are showing up in stores, said Mike Cutshaw, an
attorney representing the National Association of Recording
Merchandisers.
   Last week, Capitol Records promised to provide legal help to
store operators who are threatened with arrest for selling its
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit
lyrics.
   The producers of the Grammy Awards show have said such a law
would scuttle Louisiana's chances of playing host to the event.
Also, backers of a proposed Grammy Hall of Fame in New Orleans say
the law would end their project and cost the city $100 million a
year.
   The legislation would not take effect until 1992. Rep. Ted Haik,
the bill's sponsor, has said that if the industry implements its
voluntary program, he would push for repeal of the law.

   British publisher Robert Maxwell has
been forced to put his stake in Bell Group Ltd. back on the market
under terms of an out-of-court settlement with the National
Companies and Securities Commission.
   The Federal Court on Tuesday ratified the order to dispose of
the 14.9 percent holding in the group, declaring Bell director
David Aspinall was in breach of takeover regulations when he
originally acquired the shares.
   Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court is believed to be
among potential bidders interested in the parcel of more than 54
million shares in the group, which owns the West Australian
newspaper.
   The stock will be tendered at a confidential reserve price.
   If a buyer cannot be found at or above the price agreed with the
NCSC, then the shares will be returned to Maxwell.
   Commission officials alleged Aspinall had breached the takeover
code in his original purchase of a 16.57 percent Bell holding
because he was deemed to be an associate of the company's 74.5
percent parent, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.
   The order to put the shares back on the market resulted from an
out-of-court settlement Tuesday among the NCSC, Aspinall and
Maxwell.

   Prodded by British officials, economic summit
negotiators renewed efforts today to resolve differences over
President Bush's proposal to abolish billions of dollars in foreign
farm subsidies.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills was meeting later in the
day with Frans Andriessen, the top trade negotiator for the
European Community, to discuss ways to break their stalemate over
the farm subsidy question.
   Afterwards, aides to summit leaders were expected to meet late
into the night in their search for a trade compromise to include in
the final summit communique that will be issued Wednesday.
   British officials urged compromise. Britain is a member of the
European Community but doesn't have as big a stake in the subsidy
issue because it has fewer and smaller farms than their summit
partners.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned today that failure
to reach agreement could be extremely damaging to long-term global
prosperity.
   ``This negotiation will not succeed unless we are all prepared
to go for a compromise,'' he said in a BBC interview.
   While fights over the arcane language of trade agreements
usually are left to subordinates to settle, this dispute has
attracted the attention of the leaders of seven major industrial
democracies because of the huge stakes involved.
   The Bush administration believes that the United States' best
hope of resolving its $100 billion trade imbalance is to expand
export opportunities for U.S. farmers and businesses by
liberalizing the rules governing world trade.
   Freer global trade also holds out the promise of providing an
economic lifeline for struggling new democracies in Eastern Europe
and Latin America by expanding the markets for their goods.
   But it is far from clear whether the trade talks, known as the
Uruguay Round for the country where they began in 1986, will
succeed, given entrenched positions in such areas as agriculture.
The talks are being conducted by the 97-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the world body that governs trade.
   Before coming to Houston, Bush said that without fundamental
reform in agriculture, the United States would walk away from the
Uruguay Round. Bush aides said Monday that the president has been
taking a tough line in Houston in his discussions with summit
colleagues.
   ``The president has been doing a very good job to indicate why
agriculture is the lynchpin to these negotiations,'' Ms. Hills said.
   Bush brought up the trade negotiations in a string of one-on-one
sessions with world leaders and then devoted a part of the first
formal session Monday to talking about agriculture.
   Bush is ``making the point very forcefully to his summit
partners that this is an enormously important activity,''
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told reporters, calling
Bush's discussions a ``motivating session'' to get the Europeans
engaged.
   In discussions with Jacques Delores, president of the European
Community's executive body, Bush took a tough stance, telling
Delors that the political leaders needed to exhibit political
courage to resolve the issue, an EC official said.
   ``It was tough. It was frank,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Bush also discussed the farm dispute in separate meetings with
French President Francois Mitterrand and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, the two European leaders with the strongest opposition
to total elimination of farm subsidies.
   Kohl, however, indicated that in his discussions he believed a
compromise proposal on the agricultural issue represented a good
starting point to trying to resolve the issue.
   The document, drawn up by Aart de Zeeuw, a former Dutch official
who is chairing the agricultural negotiations, strikes a
middle-ground between the defensive EC position and the aggressive
U.S. stance.
   In the summit's opening session, Kohl told the other leaders
that there was a critical need to insure a successful conclusion of
the trade talks, being held under the auspices of the 97-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   He told the leaders that the summit needed to ``give the
negotiators ... a positive signal and a political orientation that
we all jointly stand for strengthening the GATT.''
   Yeutter said Kohl's stance was ``mildly encouraging'' with other
officials suggesting that it could represent a breakthrough if
other European nations follow West Germany's lead.
   Hills told reporters that the United States hoped to achieve a
commitment from the summit countries to use the de Zeeuw paper as
the basis for working out a final agreement on agriculture.
   In addition to phasing out farm subsidies, the United States has
an ambitious goal of expanding global trade rules to include about
$1 trillion in trade not now covered by the GATT
   The U.S. proposal would result in the elimination of barriers to
trade in the high-growth area of banking and other services, where
U.S. companies are extremely competitive.
   American negotiators are also pushing to extend GATT rules to
cover better enforcement of trade and copyright piracy, which is
estimated to cost American companies $60 billion in lost sales each
year.
   Agriculture is seen as the key to the whole U.S. package because
Third World countries have balked at agreeing to the proposals on
expanding GATT coverage unless they win expanded markets for their
farm products.

   After a partial verdict in the first trial
stemming from an FBI commodity sting operation, the government
plans to try again to prove that three traders conspired to cheat
customers.
   In addition to a racketeering charge that stumped a U.S.
District Court jury, prosecutors also plan to refile scores of
fraud charges against the defendants.
   ``It is our intention at this point to go forward with the
remaining charges,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pollack said
after the jury ended 11 days of deliberations by returning verdicts
on only 30 of 116 counts.
   The panel convicted two traders on commodity fraud charges and
acquitted a third. U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams, who
presided over the nearly two months of proceedings, declared a
mistrial on the counts the jury didn't resolve.
   Robert D. Mosky, 34, a floor broker portrayed by prosecutors as
the leader of a fraud scheme in the Merc's Swiss franc futures pit,
was found guilty of seven counts of Commodity Exchange Act fraud,
the least serious charges against him.
   The jury acquitted him of 20 commodity, mail and wire fraud
charges and deadlocked on 55 other counts, including a racketeering
charge.
   Independent trader Danny L. Scheck, 28, was convicted of one
count of commodity fraud. The jury could not reach a verdict on 19
other counts against Scheck.
   David Zatz, 43, another independent trader in the Swiss franc
pit, was acquitted on two commodity fraud counts. The jury could
not decide 12 other counts against Zatz.
   Each commodity fraud count carries a maximum prison sentence of
five years and a $100,000 fine, prosecutors said.
   The men were the first group of commodities traders to stand
trial on charges resulting from a continuing FBI probe of
corruption at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's
biggest commodity futures markets.
   Two other groups _ 13 soybean traders from the Board of Trade
and 15 Japanese yen traders from the Merc _ go on trial in
September.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Fleissner is not working on those
cases but said their structure probably would be similar.
   ``We have certain kinds of evidence. The agent will testify
about what he saw. The people who are testifying as cooperators
will testify about what they saw. We will play tapes,'' he said.
   In all, 48 people have been indicted since last August. Sixteen
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges, including two Swiss franc
traders who testified against Mosky, Scheck and Zatz.
   U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson, asked how Monday's verdict might
affect the trials of other indicted traders, said, ``It doesn't
mean anything.''
   But defense lawyers said the partial victory was a serious blow
to the government's investigation.
   Mosky's lawyer, Elliott Samuels, had argued during the trial
that the prosecution represented an ``overzealous'' and
``outrageous'' government attempt to enforce vague trading
regulations arbitrarily.
   ``I'd like to think the jury was disturbed about the
government's theory,'' Samuels said after the verdicts were
announced.
   Alan Blumenthal said that as far as his client, Zatz, was
concerned, the government didn't convince the jury any laws had
been broken.
   ``They were presented comprehensive evidence, and there was no
finding of proof,'' Blumenthal said. ``As it stands right now, my
client is innocent.''
   The Chicago Merc's board of governors will discuss what action,
if any, to take against the convicted traders during a meeting
Wednesday, said Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   In the trial, which began May 8, the government contended the
defendants conspired to cheat customers by changing the prices at
which customer orders were executed or through pre-arranged and
off-market trades that prevented the orders from being offered in
the open, competitive market.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity _
in this case a quantity of Swiss francs _ at a price agreed upon in
advance.
   Prosecutors said Mosky used the stolen customer profits _
sometimes as small as $12.50 per trade _ to pad his own account and
to repay Scheck and Zatz for illegally accepting the financial
liability for his trading errors.
   Defense lawyers argued their clients had done no wrong. They
contended the government's star witness, undercover FBI agent
Randall Jannett, was so ill-prepared for his role as a trader that
in the seeming chaos of the trading pit he mistook the defendants'
legitimate actions for improprieties.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.62 million shares.
   Analysts said stock traders were keeping a close watch on the
bond market. Bond prices have been under pressure due to an
unexpected dip in the June unemployment rate, released Friday, and
a large supply of new issues coming to market. Lower bond prices
raise interest rates, which is bad news for the stock market.
   Stock investors also are awaiting second-quarter earnings

   The United States and West Germany appeared
headed today toward a summit agreement on environmental concerns
that sought to obscure their sharp differences over global warming.
   Negotiators from Washington and Bonn sought to strike a
conciliatory deal stressing a united front on protecting tropical
rain forests and playing down their dispute over what should be
done about pollutants that contribute to warming of the Earth's
climate, summit sources said.
   Details of the forest protection accord were unavailable in
advance of an afternoon session of the seven-nation economic summit
dealing with the environment. The agreement is to be included in
the final summit communique that will be issued Wednesday.
   Word of the negotiating bid for harmony on the environmental
issue emerged one day after West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
White House chief of staff John Sununu exchanged critical jabs over
their countries' divergent approaches to global warming.
   Sununu accused the West Germans of being leaders in global
warming rhetorics. Kohl took aim at President Bush's call for
further study of the problem rather than hasty action that might
cause needless economic damage.
   U.S. officials had gotten the impression in pre-summit talks
that the Germans might take a flexible stance at the summit on
their calls for specific goals for reducing emissions of carbon
dioxide and other ``greenhouse gases'' blamed for an increase in
the Earth's temperatures.
   Although environmental policy was not scheduled for summit
discussion until this afternoon, the French and German leaders
pointedly addressed it in their opening presentations on Monday.
   And East European environmentalists appealed to the summit
leaders at a news conference to help their countries clean up.
   ``In the past, money was pumped into the government without
economic or environmental concern,'' said Zbigniew Bochniarz, a
member of the Polish Ecology Club. ``Now we must create a new
approach and build conditions that will modernize outdated
pollution standards.''
   Kohl said in his opening session pitch that ``decisive measures
are needed to reduce the greenhouse effect,'' a term referring to
the gradually warming climates around the world.
   ``A lack of scientific knowledge about the causes and effect
cannot justify slowing down the taking of concrete measures,'' Kohl
told his colleagues at the summit.
   The statement was clearly aimed at Bush, who contends that more
study is needed on global warming before taking dramatic steps
urged by Germany and other Europeans to cut the carbon dioxide
emissions from burning of fossil fuels, said to be the principal
cause of global warming.
   Kohl said, however, that ``what is foremost required is drastic
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions ...''
   The Houston summit should give ``a clear and concrete signal for
the effective protection of mankind and environment,'' Kohl said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand joined Kohl in calling for
specific steps, according to his spokesman Hubert Vedrine.
   Mitterrand said the summit leaders should not be satisfied with
simply a general declaration on the environment. ``There should be
specific commitments to reduce pollution and save forests,'' the
spokesman quoted Mitterrand as saying.
   Earlier, Sununu was asked about an environmental group's
scorecard which rated West Germany much higher than the United
States regarding steps to protect the environment. Sununu replied
that ``West Germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric.''
   ``If you take a good look at what the United States has actually
done in terms of cleaning up our environment ... I don't think the
United States has to take a back seat to anyone,'' he said.
   Sununu and others in the administration contend that committing
to carbon dioxide reduction goals would devastate the U.S. economy
because of the heavy dependence on fossil fuels.
   He told a news conference that the administration is concerned
that specific reduction targets amount to a ``perpetual
stabilization,'' and that ``continued economic growth ... requires
that you continue to use energy, and that any growth at all then
would not be permitted.''
   The Germans have led the way in Europe by pledging to cut carbon
dioxide releases by 25 percent by the year 2005.

   Who said: ``There is no quicker way to kill
prosperity than to raise taxes?''
   Perhaps a clue would help. He's the person who also said, ``When
the government raises a dollar in revenues, Congress spends a
dollar fifty.'' And who said, ``The surest way to kill the recovery
is to raise taxes.''
   George Bush isn't being let off easily by those who thought they
had read ``no new taxes'' on his lips. Economist Daniel Mitchell,
for example, reminds us that Bush is the author of all three quotes.
   Mitchell is a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank whose ideas have been listened to by officials in both
the Reagan and Bush administrations. Mitchell's words suggest his
fury. To wit:
   ``If George Bush had pardoned Willie Horton, or burned Old Glory
on the lawn of the White House, it would hardly have rivaled the
flip-flop committed on taxes.''
   To him, ``The battle over taxes is a battle not only for the
economy; it is a battle for the integrity and character of the Bush
presidency.''
   Only slightly less upset were David Makarechian and Bryan Riley
of Citizens for a Sound Economy, who followed Bush's explanation
for his apparent change of mind _ the need to reduce the deficit _
with an explanation of their own.
   ``President Bush's June 26 announcement that tax revenue
increases must be included as part of the deficit reduction package
now being negotiated in the budget summit is superfluous,'' they
stated. No qualifications, whatever.
   The sole purpose for including tax increases in a deficit
reduction package, they said, ``is to allow faster spending growth
than if the government relied upon spending restraints alone.''
   The Wall Street Journal observed that it was impossible to
determine which of several ``wacko tax proposals'' are likely to be
enacted, and suggested President Bush was losing control of his own
economic policy.
   ``The last time a national leader lost control of economic
policy,'' it said in an apparent reference to former President
Carter, ``we suffered a malaise not suffered in this country for
more than a decade.''
   The Journal seemed especially upset at what seems to be a
contradiction in regard to stock transactions: a cut in the capital
gains tax rate on stocks that are sold after having risen in value,
but a new tax on stock transfers.
   The Bush administration has not formally proposed the latter,
but rumors have circulated that it is considering doing so. It
prompted the Journal to comment that ``we are tempted to dismiss
this proposal as patently absurd, except that with lip reading out
of style we can take nothing for granted.''
   The intensity of feeling is noteworthy because most of it comes
from those who have endorsed the President's reluctance to add to
the tax bill, and most seem to offer the same rationale, that new
taxes simply mean new spending.
   At the same time, the President's stance is not a surprise to
them. Two weeks before the President's comment about tax revenues
increases, the Tax Foundation, a private research organization,
issued this comment:
   ``Only 10 of the last 62 budgets paid their own way without
deficit spending, and in none of the last 21 years has the budget
been balanced.
   ``Unfortunately, by the light of recent budget summit history,
any deficit reduction deal could be a bad deal for taxpayers.''

   Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer held a meeting for four of his OPEC counterparts on Tuesday
to discuss ways to ease the oil price slump in preparation for the
cartel's July 25 session.
   The gathering followed instructions from King Fahd to work for
the success of the meeting that will be held in Geneva at the end
of the month, according to statements issued after the weekly
cabinet session.
   Present with Nazer in the Saudi summer capital of Jiddah were
Rashid al-Ameeri of Kuwait, Mana Saeed Otaiba of the United Arab
Emirates, Sheik Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar and Issam
al-Chalabi of Iraq.
   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
not been able to maintain a lid on the output of member states
within the 21.086 million barrel per day aggregate ceiling, and the
glut has been pushing prices down, threatening an oil price crash
similar to the one that occurred in 1986.
   The Geneva meeting will provide a forum to discuss future
production and pricing strategy. Reports have indicated the meeting
may be devoted only to the next three months and then be reconvened
in September.
   The main culprits for the overproduction are Kuwait and the
U.A.E. Iraq has been leading the pressure on both its Gulf
neighbors to conform to the production levels. Iraq also rejects
demands by Kuwait and the U.A.E. to have their OPEC-decreed
production ceilings increased.
   Saudi Arabia, the dominant party within the cartel, is reported
to be keen to preserve the current ceiling because of its static
defense for the OPEC reference price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia
also is pledged to demand a barrel for a barrel in case quota
levels are increased, insisting its share of OPEC production
ceilings must be 24.45 percent in line with its huge reserves.
   Nazer's meeting with his four counterparts was preceded by a
tour he made of each of their capitals to deliver letters to
respective leaders from King Fahd.
   Nazer has also conferred with the OPEC chief Sadek Boussena, who
was recently on a tour of the Gulf OPEC states and demanded they
adhere to their production quota levels.

<HEAD>Pound Surges On Speculation That Britain Will Join Mechanism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pound surged to an 18-month high Tuesday on
continuing speculation that Britain would soon join Europe's
currency-steadying exchange rate mechanism.
   The British government is trying to talk up sterling to fight
inflation and bring the currency into the mechanism at a high
level, analysts said.
   The exchange rate mechanism, known as ERM, is built into the
European Monetary System and limits the fluctuations of nine of the
12 European Community currencies. Britain, Portugal and Greece are
the outsiders.
   Joining the mechanism would reduce sterling's volatility and
help curb inflation, the system's proponents say.
   The pound, which moved higher during the day, finished at
$1.8155 in Europe late Tuesday, up 1 cent from late Monday. That
was the pound's highest level since it finished at $1.8270 on Jan.
3, 1989.
   Buying was extremely heavy, dealers said.
   ``There has been a lot of good solid investment demand for
sterling,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, an economist at the London
investment firm James Capel and Co.
   The pound has gained 21.5 cents, or 13 percent, since mid-March,
when it fetched $1.6005. It also has risen strongly against the
German mark and the Japanese yen.
   Analysts predicted sterling's four-month climb is likely to
continue.
   ``The pound has quite a lot of room on the upside, especially
against the dollar,'' said Paul Chertkow, chief currency strategist
at Citibank in London. Dennis said the pound could fetch as much as
$1.87 in coming weeks. Chertkow expects it to reach $1.90 within
three months.
   The pound also has been sustained by Britain's 15 percent
interest rates, which are nearly double West Germany's and are
designed to fight inflation, now running at 9.7 percent.
   Speculation about entry into the ERM ``has gotten more and more
intense,'' Dennis said. ``In a series of comments, statements,
speeches, announcements, the government gradually has drip-fed the
market information to encourage them to believe that sterling is
going to join.''
   ``They have talked up the pound specifically to get it at a
certain level at which they would like to join,'' he continued.
``It takes away the downside for sterling.''
   The pound got an added boost from Britain's top Treasury
official, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, who said Monday
that the pound's climb was sustainable and that no interest rate
cuts were planned.
   Inflation must improve before interest rates come down, Major
told reporters at the Group of Seven meeting of major
industrialized nations in Houston.
   He reiterated that Britain wouldn't join the mechanism until
Britain's inflation is more in line with the European Community's.
   That is the major outstanding condition outlined by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has committed Britain to joining
but has not set a timetable.
   Analysts expect Mrs. Thatcher to link the pound to the ERM in
the autumn, well before the next general election, which must be
called by mid-1992 but could come in a year.
   The government says that excluding mortgage rates, inflation is
7 percent and closer to the EC's average of 5 percent.
   The government is believed to want to enter the mechanism with a
strong pound so that Britain can cut interest rates before voters
go to the polls.
   A stronger pound in effect adds up to tighter monetary policy.
It fights inflation by making it difficult for companies to grant
wage increases and forcing them to keep down costs to retain export
markets.
   But a strong pound increases pressure on companies already
struggling with high interest rates, stock traders said.
   British stocks have fallen in recent days amid concern that the
pound's rise would hurt British exports and corporate profits.

   The state Supreme Court ruled that patients
have no right to share in profits if their blood or organs become
the source of lucrative scientific research.
   In a major victory for the U.S. biotechnology industry, the
court said that John Moore, a leukemia victim whose spleen was
removed for medical reasons, could not sue researchers and
commercial laboratories on the claim that his personal property was
being misused. He did, however, win limited rights to sue on more
narrow grounds.
   The 5-2 decision Monday said that researchers used the victim's
spleen without his knowledge to develop a blood protein with
multibillion-dollar medical potential.
   Allowing such a suit ``threatens to destroy the economic
incentive to conduct important medical research,'' said the opinion
by Justice Edward Panelli.
   The multibillion-dollar industry relies heavily on a plentiful
supply of human cell lines, thousands of which exist in tissue
repositories throughout the country.
   The court unanimously allowed Moore, of Seattle, to maintain his
suit on a more limited basis, a claim that the doctor who removed
his spleen and later withdrew blood samples over several years had
failed to disclose his personal interests before getting Moore's
consent to the procedures.
   That part of the ruling should encourage a more open
doctor-patient relationship in the future, said Cynthia Fruchtman,
a Los Angeles lawyer and expert in genetic engineering.
   ``It's going to facilitate a dialogue between participants in
research and researchers themselves, so that the public knows
what's going on,'' said Fruchtman.
   After Moore's suit was filed, she said, some research hospitals
changed their consent forms to specify that tissues removed may be
used in research.
   ``If nothing else, it allows the patient to ask questions about
what's going on,'' Fruchtman said. ``One of John Moore's
complaints, as I understand his suit, was that he wasn't given that
information and the opportunity to ask those questions.''
   The disadvantages to Moore in such a suit are that he cannot sue
the laboratories, unless he can show that they were involved in the
failure to disclose facts, and that under normal legal rules he
could recover damages only for whatever losses he suffered, without
sharing in any profits.
   ``It would appear that a justifiable sigh of relief should go up
from the scientific community,'' said Richard D. Godown, president
of the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade group of 107
companies.
   A defendant in the case, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., had
warned in papers filed with the court that ``the field of
biomedical research will be plunged into a state of chaos for
years'' if the court allowed a suit for ``conversion,'' or use of
Moore's property without his consent.
   However, Moore's lawyer, Sanford Gage, said the limited claim
allowed by the court could still include a share of the profits.
   A doctor who operated on Moore without proper consent, and
companies that knowingly took part in non-disclosures over the
following years, could be required to ``disgorge ill-gotten
gains,'' Gage said.
   He said he considered the limited decision a victory because
``this allows us to proceed and it does protect patient rights.''
   Moore was a 31-year-old Alaska pipeline surveyor in 1976 when he
sought treatment for a type of leukemia called hairy-cell leukemia
at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. David Golde
removed Moore's spleen, a standard treatment, and the disease has
not recurred.
   While testing the removed spleen, Golde discovered it contained
unique blood cells that produced a blood protein called GM-CSF,
which is now in experimental use as a drug to stimulate the immune
system to fight certain cancers and possibly AIDS.
   For nearly seven years, Moore's suit said, Golde and others
brought Moore from Seattle to Los Angeles for blood tests and other
procedures _ never telling him of his cells' value _ while they
developed Moore's cells into a self-perpetuating cell line to
mass-produce GM-CSF.
   The Regents of the University of California patented the cell
line in 1984, naming Golde and a research assistant, Shirley Quan,
as the inventors. The same year, Moore sued Golde, Quan, the UC
Regents and the two companies working on the product, Sandoz and
Genetics Institute Inc.
   The suit estimated the potential value of the product as $3
billion. It said Golde and others had gotten $3 million worth of
Genetics Institute stock.
   Golde's lawyer, Donn Dimichele, said today that he was pleased
that the court had rejected Moore's main claim but uncertain about
the effect of the section that would allow suits for failure to
disclose a researcher's interests.

<HEAD>Girard May Renew Proxy Battle for Pic 'N' Save if No Buyer Emerges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOMINGUEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment group Girard Partners
L.P. reiterated its plans to start a proxy fight for control of Pic
'N' Save Corp. if the close-out chain is unable to find a buyer by
Sunday.
   In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Girard gave no assurance it will bid for Pic 'N' Save. Analysts
estimate Pic 'N' Save, based in the Los Angeles suburb of
Dominguez, is worth up to $16 per share, or $560 million.
   Girard, headed by investor David H. Batchelder, said it needs
additional equity beyond the $18 million its partners have
committed, as well as debt financing, if it is to buy Pic 'N' Save.
   La Jolla-based Girard previously threatened a proxy fight, but
Batchelder and Pic 'N' Save agreed in June to wait until July 15 so
that the company's management could review buyout proposals.

<HEAD>Japanese Investments Helping South, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investments could prove a bonanza
for southern states in terms of jobs, tax revenues and business
know-how, according to a new study.
   Japanese investment is a means by which the South can replace
jobs lost through import competition, said the report released
Monday.
   Transplant companies also have had some positive effects on U.S.
firms, pushing them to match or exceed foreign standards of
excellence, says the study from the Southern Growth Policies Board,
a public, interstate agency that examines economic issues facing
the South.
   The Japanese rank second to the British among foreign investors
in the United States, according to 1988 figures compiled in the
report. Japanese-owned assets totaled $450 billion, representing
about 1.7 percent of all U.S. assets.
   Japan was only the seventh largest foreign investor in 1980, the
authors noted. If present trends continue through the 1990s, Japan
will likely supplant the British as the largest foreign investor.
   Japanese companies differ from their competitors, the report
said. They invest more heavily in training and retraining
employees, allow for more decision-making at the point of
production and tend to use more highly automated machinery.
   On the minus side, Japanese plants create fewer jobs than would
might because they tend to be highly automated, the report said.

<HEAD>Domino's Signs One-Year Test for Pizza in Four Burger Kings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You won't be able to have it your way
just yet, but this September Burger King will begin test marketing
6-inch Domino's pizzas at four South Carolina hamburger restaurants.
   The one-year experiment is aimed at McDonald's Corp.'s test of
its own pizza in 200 of its eateries.
   A licensing agreement was signed last week between Burger King,
the nation's second largest fast-food chain, and Domino's newly
created Pizzazz Division. It calls for test marketing at four
restaurants in Columbia, S.C., Domino's spokesman Burke Cueny said
Tuesday.
   Cueny said toppings for the pizzas have yet to be determined and
the four stores will offer two or three kinds of pies at the start.
   ``There may be a point where we will offer larger-style pizzas
down the road,'' he said. There are 22 Burger King outlets in the
Columbia area, which is home of the University of South Carolina.
   McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food chain, currently
sells 14-inch pizzas in about 200 restaurants located in and around
Evansville, Ind., Las Vegas, Hartford, Conn., and Fresno, Calif.,
said company spokesman Chuck Ebeling.
   ``The test is going very well and we think the future of that
product looks bright,'' he said. Ebeling refused to say when
McDonald's would decide whether to expand the program.
   McDonald's pizzas, which the company makes itself, come with
cheese, sausage, pepperoni or a combination of those toppings. They
cost between $6 and $10, depending on toppings and markets, Ebeling
said.
   Burger King, bought last year by Grand Metropolitan PLC, has
about 6,000 stores nationwide. Domino's, which owner Tom Monaghan
has said is up for sale, has about 5,000 kitchen and delivery
outlets, and is the largest pizza delivery company in the nation.
   ``Whether the company is being sold or not, we're making some
good long-term decisions,'' said Pizzazz Vice President Glenn
Mueller. ``(Domino's President) Dave Black and the management at
Domino's Pizza is getting back to growth. They're trying new and
innovative ways.''
   Domino's hopes Pizzazz will add 1,000 new outlets and $500
million in annual sales by 1993. Some of Domino's Pizzazz stores
will have tables and chairs, some will be drive-through and others
may offer carryout services.

   Stock prices fell today in quiet trading as the
market looked for direction and computerized sell programs
accelerated the downward trend.
   Analysts said stock traders were closely monitoring the bond
market, where prices were down slightly.
   Bond prices have been under pressure due to an unexpected dip in
the June unemployment rate, released Friday, and a large supply of
new issues coming to market. Lower bond prices raise interest
rates, which is bad news for the stock market.
   Stock investors also are awaiting second-quarter earnings
reports before making any significant market moves, analysts say.
   Investors have been bracing for disappointing earnings, analysts
say. But the June unemployment report confused the market because
it implied that corporate profits may not be as soft as some
suspected, said Jack Solomon, who follows the market for Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co.
   Solomon said the market also was awaiting news from the economic
summit meeting of leaders of the seven largest industrial nations
in Houston.
   ``It seems to be a marking-time phase that we're going
through,'' he said.
   As the market neared its close for the day, computerized selling
linked to stock futures trading sent prices down further.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Posts 27.9 Percent Decline in Second-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday its
second-quarter profit skidded 27.9 percent because of costs related
to its acquisition of Telerate Inc. and weakness in the market for
information services.
   The company, which publishes the Wall Street Journal and
Barron's magazine, said it earned $34.9 million, or 3itution
will be seized by the government.
   Agency officials plan to test the program with 10 institutions
over the next two or three months. After that, they estimate that
155 to 180 of the 260 S&amp;L failures expected in the next year could
be handled in the accelerated program.
   Private analysts are cautiously endorsing the strategy, although
they note that the RTC has yet to deal with nearly 250 institutions
that failed previously. It has handled more than 200 failed thrifts
in its first 11 months.
   ``I think, in principal, it's a good idea. The only question is
whether they are so overloaded now with all the clearly insolvent
institutions,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a
liberal research group in Washington.
   ``You're going to be using scarce resources for (marginally
insolvent) thrifts ahead of other institutions that are clearly in
much worse shape,'' he said.
   However, Litan said taxpayers might save money by bailing out an
institution on the edge of insolvency, when its owners may be most
tempted to gamble. A deeply insolvent S&amp;L under government control
often is not in danger of further deterioration, he said.
   ``If you're in the government, the thing to do is not to focus
on past losses but to focus on how to prevent future losses from
occurring,'' he said.
   Economist James Barth of Auburn University said the program
might be a better way of handling the loans, real estate and other
assets of a failed thrift.
   In the conventional S&amp;L bailouts so far, the government has been
stuck with about half of the assets, which it hopes to sell later.
Officials hope in accelerated resolution deals, the new owner
rather than the government will get most of the assets.
   ``The RTC has so many assets it has to try new and different
things to get those assets back into the private sector,'' Barth
said. ``If they're not careful, they're going to wind up with the
worlds' largest troubled savings and loan and its going to be
called the Resolution Trust Corp.''

   Energy futures ended higher in active trading
Tuesday, led by another sharp gain in unleaded gasoline prices.
   Traders said seasonal demands and concerns about supplies were
largely responsible for gasoline's surge, which helped boost other
petroleum products.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled up 1.01 cents to 57.86 cents a
gallon, following a 1.44-cent advance on Monday. Other contract
months also rose in price.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude oil, rose 36 cents to $16.94 a 42-gallon
barrel. The contracts for delivery through November also settled
higher.
   Among other refined products traded on the Merc, August home
heating oil, which gained 0.60 cent on Monday, settled at 49.28
cents a gallon, up 0.38 cent.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract rose to $1.500 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.493 on Monday.
   Peter Beutel, a trader with Merril Lynch Energy Futures, said
some dealers were concerned that last week's explosion at an Arco
Chemical Co. plant near Houston might effect gasoline supplies at a
time when demand is high.
   Arco was a major producer of methyl tertiary butyl ether, a
high-octane blending component used instead of lead in gasoline.
   ``Refiners may have to refine more crude oil to get the same
amount of octane,'' Beutel said.
   Also lifting energy futures Tuesday was speculation that the
latest American Petroleum Institute report, due out after the
market closed Tuesday, would show a drop in crude oil stocks,
traders said.

   The government sold $5 billion of 30-year
bonds Tuesday to help finance its bailout of the savings and loan
industry.
   The bonds were sold at an average yield of 8.93 percent and will
carry a coupon interest rate of 8~ percent, with a $10,000 bond
selling for $9,942.70.
   The Resolution Funding Corp., or Refcorp, received bids totaling
$15.5 billion.
   In two previous auctions this year, Refcorp received bids
totaling $8.90 billion for a $3.5 billion issue last April and
$8.17 billion in bids for $5 billion last January.
   Both earlier auctions involved 40-year bonds, marking the first
time in 35 years the government had sold paper of more than 30
years' maturity.
   The April bonds were sold at an average yield of 8.89 percent,
up from 8.60 percent at the January auction.
   Refcorp's first auction last October sold $4.5 billion in
30-year bonds with an average yield of 8.15 percent. The agency
thus has sold $18.5 billion.
   Legislation last August authorized the government to borrow $30
billion through Refcorp, an arrangement that keeps the spending out
of the federal budget deficit.

   Membership in labor unions that represent workers
in manufacturing registered its biggest drop in three years in
1989, according to a forthcoming report by the Grant Thornton
consulting firm.
   The reason: greater demand for high-tech workers.
   ``There are fewer unions in the high-tech area, and those that
are are not organizing as effectively,'' said Selwin Price, a
partner at Grant Thornton. High-tech workers ``are better educated,
higher skilled, and management might keep them happier.''
   He divided manufacturing into two categories: ``low-tech,'' such
as the steel, automobile and garment industries; and high-tech,
such as computers.
   Grant Thornton is a Chicago-based accounting and management
consulting firm. Its statistics on unions are contained in its
annual Manufacturing Climates Study to be released Aug. 16. Price
is in charge of the study.
   The study's figures show labor union membership in manufacturing
fell by 153,000 workers last year.
   That represents a 3.2 percent drop from union membership of
4.771 million in 1988 and the largest yearly decline since 1986.
That year there was a decline of 199,500 card-carrying industrial
workers, a 3.8 percent drop.
   By contrast, total manufacturing jobs showed a slight increase
at the same time, rising 1.0 percent in 1989 and 2.3 percent over
the past three years, the firm said.
   Grant Thornton has been following union membership in
manufacturing jobs since 1984, when 27.26 percent of all workers in
industrial occupations belonged to unions. In 1989 that number was
down to 23.84 percent.
   Michigan was the only state last year where more than half, 51.7
percent, of manufacturing workers belonged to unions. New York was
second, with 47.23 percent. Florida was the only state to register
an increase, adding 700 union members, the study found.
   States with the lowest percentage of union membership were South
Dakota, 2.34 percent; South Carolina, 2.95 percent; and Arizona,
3.69 percent.
   Figures for the study were based on average, annual full-time
dues-paying members and gathered from financial reports that unions
filed with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   ``It surely does not portend good for unionism, because we've
seen a decline every year, Price said.
   ``This decline has caused unions to realize their future could
be in jeopardy,'' he said. ``On the other hand, maybe if there were
no unions, maybe the companies wouldn't have the incentive to treat
their employees so well.''
   Rex Hardesty, an AFL-CIO spokesman in Washington, agreed with
some of Price's conclusions. For one, high-tech workers are harder
to organize into unions, he said.
   ``There's no strong union tradition'' in high-tech, Hardesty
said. In addition, he said, many of those jobs are in the South,
where resistance to union organizing is strong.
   But he also said many former industrial workers now earn their
living in the service industry or in occupations that have no union.
   ``We have twice as many former union members as we have union
members. (A former line worker is) now a cement finisher with his
brother-in-law or putting on seat covers,'' Hardesty said, ``and
that represents a shift from manufacturing, mining, and
construction and railroads into the service industry.''
   Hardesty noted that when the AFL-CIO was formed 35 years ago, 58
percent of Americans made their living in manufacturing, mining and
construction. Today that proportion is 25 percent, he said.

   Stock prices drifted lower Tuesday in quiet

<HEAD>Dollar Falls As British Pound Continues To Surge; Gold Slides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pound took center stage in foreign exchange
trading Tuesday, sending the dollar to an 18th-month low against
the British currency.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, fell sharply on reports of heavy Middle
East selling.
   ``The British pound is the whole story,'' said Robert Ryan,
chief foreign exchange dealer with Bank of New York Co., summing up
the day.
   Sterling's rise came amid continuing speculation that Britain
will soon join Western Europe's currency-steadying exchange rate
mechanism, known as the ERM.
   Built into the European Monetary System, the ERM limits the
fluctuations of nine of the 12 European Economic community
countries. Britain, Greece and Portugal are the three countries
still outside the system.
   In London, the pound rose by 1 cent from Monday to $1.8155 _ its
highest rate against the dollar since Jan. 3, 1989, when it reached
$1.8270. At its peak Tuesday, the pound reached $1.8270 and buying
was extremely heavy, dealers said.
   In later New York trading, sterling also advanced sharply,
rising to $1.8220 from $1.8080 late Monday.
   The dollar also fell sharply against the Japanese yen. The yen
rose after a Washington-based advisory firm, Smick Medley
International, predicted the Bank of Japan will raise interest
rates during the next few months.
   Foreign exchange dealers said that forecast, on the back of
concern over the relative place of U.S. interest rates in the world
market, forced down the dollar's exchange rate against the Japanese
currency.
   The dollar plunged to 148.225 yen in New York from Monday's
151.15. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar dropped to 149.60 yen from
150.70 yen late Monday, and it was quoted lower in London at 148.85
yen.
   Ryan said the currencies of other countries with higher interest
rates, including Australia and Canada, were also benefiting from
their superior yields.
   The U.S. dollar slumped to 1.15695 Canadian dollars from 1.15855
late Monday. In Europe earlier, it fell to 1.1570 Canadian dollars
from 1.1590.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
prices, included: 1.64185 West German marks, down from 1.6528;
1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3965; 5.51225 French francs, down
from 5.5460; and 1,203.00 Italian lire, down from 1.21125.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
1.6465 West German marks, down from 1.6495; 1.3945 Swiss francs,
down from 1.3950; 5.5270 French francs, down from 5.5353; 1.8555
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8573; and 1,207.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,208.50.
   Gold prices fell in New York and in earlier overseas trading on
reports of heavy selling by Middle East investors. One Zurich
dealer estimated 10 tons to 15 tons of gold were unloaded.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold fell
$2.70 to $355.50. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid price
of $354.80 a troy ounce, down $2.60.
   In London, the late bid price of gold was $353.75 a troy ounce,
down from $358.15 late Monday. The Zurich late bid was $353.90 an
ounce, down from $357.90.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $358.25 an ounce, down
from $359.95. Silver prices were mixed. They rose in New York,
where a troy ounce of silver picked up 1.1 cent and closed at
$4.811 on the Commodity Exchange. In London, silver traded at a bid
price of $4.82 a troy ounce, down from $4.86 late Monday.

<HEAD>Middle East Selling Gives Gold Market A Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of new Middle Eastern bullion sales triggered an early
slide in gold futures prices Tuesday but the market partially
recovered after traders learned the amount of physical gold sold
was relatively small.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures advanced; sugar
futures rallied; cotton slipped further; livestock and meat futures
were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $2.70 to $3 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in August at $357.10 a troy
ounce. The lightly traded July contract finished at $355.50.
   Silver futures settled 1 cent to 1.4 cents higher with July at
$4.811 a troy ounce.
   Gold prices plunged about $5 an ounce early in the session amid
rumors of new bullion sales from the Middle East.
   The talk stirred fears that Saudi Arabia was again dumping large
amounts of gold onto the market, as it is believed to have done on
three occasions this year. The previous events prompted steep
declines in gold prices, which were around $420 an ounce in
mid-February.
   Peter Cardillo, director of commodity research with the futures
brokerage Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co., said the Middle Eastern gold
sales on Tuesday appeared to have originated in the Soviet Union,
not Saudi Arabia, and the amount of gold offered for sale was
relatively small.
   When fears of another huge Saudi sale were discounted, ``I think
it took away the panic feeling,'' Cardillo said.
   Petroleum futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Hisham Nazer held a meeting for four of
his OPEC counterparts to discuss ways to ease the oil price slump
in preparation for the cartel's July 25 session.
   Crude oil futures also were supported by expectations that the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report would show a
drop in U.S. crude supplies of more than 3.5 million barrels.
   The report, which was issued after the close, showed a drop of
3.7 million barrels in the latest week.
   Gasoline stocks fell by a larger-than-expected 1.7 million
barrels; supplies of distillates rose 2.6 million barrels, which
was above market expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 22 cents to 36
cents higher with August at $16.94 a barrel; heating oil was .15
cent to .55 cent higher with August at 49.28 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to 1.01 cents higher with August at
57.86 cents a gallon.
   On the New York Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, near-term sugar
futures regained a portion of the ground lost Monday in a steep
sell-off sparked by signs of increasing supplies.
   But sugar for delivery next May and beyond slipped slightly.
   Sugar ended .04 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at
12.10 cents a pound.
   Near-term cotton futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton
Exchange for the third straight day as profit-taking continued to
erode the strong gains posted over the last six months.
   Cotton settled 1.91 cents lower to .63 cent higher with October
at 74.83 cents a pound.
   Near-term pork belly futures fell sharply on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, partly reflecting slack demand for bacon. Hog
futures ended narrowly mixed while cattle futures were mostly lower
amid profit-taking.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .28 cent lower with August at
74.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with August at 85.27 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with July at 61.02 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.6 cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at 50.57
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in lackluster
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures ended slightly lower amid selling linked to the
advancing winter wheat harvest. Corn and soybean markets were
narrowly mixed with near-term soybean futures supported by
indications the Soviet Union recently bought up to 100,000 metric
tons of U.S. soybean meal.
   Wheat futures settled } cent to 3{ cents lower with July at
$3.05{ a bushel; corn futures were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said Tuesday its second
quarter profits rose 10 percent, largely because of increased
revenue in both of its divisions.
   The real estate and food company said it earned $38.9 million,
or 66 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 16, compared with
$35.2 million, 59 cents per share, in the same period in 1989.
   Revenue rose from $693 million to $792 million.
   Castle &amp; Cooke credited rising home sales in Hawaii and higher
banana prices at its Dole Food Co. unit for the gains.
   For the first six months of the year, earnings rose 19 percent
from $47.7 million, or 80 cents per share, to $57 million, or 96
cents per share.
   Revenue rose 15 percent from $1.26 billion to $1.45 billion.
   David H. Murdock, chief executive and board chairman, also
announced Tuesday that David A. DeLorenzo, a 20-year veteran with
Dole, had been promoted to president of Dole, replacing Robert W.
Fisher, who resigned last month. DeLorenzo previously was president
of Dole Produce Co.
   DeLorenzo also will hold the title of executive vice president
in the office of the chairman of Castle &amp; Cooke.
   Castle &amp; Cooke was forced in May to delay the planned spinoff of
its Dole division to stockholders. The company said acceptable bank
financing was not available.
   Murdock said then the company remained committed to a separation
of the food and real estate operations.

<HEAD>Drug Use in Work Place on the Decline, Company Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug use in the workplace appears to be
declining, a private company said in a report released Tuesday.
   SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories said the number of
workers and job applicants who tested positive had fallen from 18
percent to 13.8 percent in three years.
   Drug experts, however, said the figure remained too high.
   ``That's still three out of every 20 workers,'' said John Tysse,
a Washington labor lawyer who specializes in cases involving drug
use in the workplace.
   ``While a trend downward, if there is one, is encouraging, that
still is an awfully high percentage,'' Tysse said. ``I would take
little comfort from that that we've licked the drug problem.''
   A spokesman for William Bennett, the president's drug policy
director, called the results ``unacceptably high'' but still ``an
indication of the positive turn on the war against drugs.''
   Ben Banta said SmithKline's reported decline probably also
indicates that drug testing is deterring Americans from using drugs
before or during work.
   Harry Groome, president of SmithKline, said attention on drug
use in the workplace appears to have led to a decline.
   SmithKline said that of the 1 million workers and job applicants
it has tested in the first six months of 1990, 13.8 percent tested
positive for drug use.
   Of a similar number tested during all of 1987, SmithKline found
that 18.1 percent tested positive.
   In separate tests of about 65,000 workers in ``safety
sensitive'' transportation jobs, 3.1 percent tested positive, the
Philadelphia-area company said.
   The results reflect findings of tests conducted over the past
six months since the federal government began requiring testing of
airline and railroad employees, bus drivers and others in the
transportation industry.
   About 4 million American transportation workers fall under the
new requirements. SmithKline Beecham owns five of the 50
laboratories the federal government has certified to run tests on
transportation workers.
   Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx said the company's
3.1 percent finding ``appears high ... based on our own
experience.''
   Marx said random drug tests of agency employees in safety
sensitive jobs found that less than 1 percent had tested positive.
After medical review, about half of those who test positive are
found to have legitimate reasons for testing positive for
prescription drugs.
   SmithKline's figures did not include post-medical review figures.
   John Mazor, a spokesman for the 40,000-member Air Line Pilots
Association, called the company's findings ``an interesting
exercise ... there are a lot of limitations in their data.''
   He noted that the company had not broken down transportation
employees into pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics and other
jobs and predicted there would be widely varying drug use among job
categories in the industry.
   The pilot's association has filed one of about 20 lawsuits
challenging the federal government's drug testing requirements.
   According to SmithKline Beecham, workers in all industries _
those in transportation and in the general work force _ who tested
positive were found most frequently to be using cocaine or
marijuana, the company said.
   Of those testing positive in the transportation industry, 43.6
percent showed traces of marijuana, while 25.2 percent tested
positive for cocaine. An additional 20 percent had used opiates
such as morphine or codeine.
   In the overall work force of those who tested positive, 39
percent had used marijuana, 21.8 percent had traces of cocaine and
9.5 percent had traces of opiates.
   Transportation workers were tested for five illegal drugs _
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates and phencyclidine, or PCP.
   Workers in the rest of the work force were also tested for
several other drugs that are often abused, such as barbiturates,
Valium and methadone.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its last-ditch effort to close a $1 billion
budget gap, the Legislature has proposed taxing virtually
everything but the kitchen sink.
   Taxpayers may be puzzled over some of the 594 new levies on
services. Who, for instance, has ever seen a telephone booth
cleaner? And how many trampoline operations are there?
   Some professional groups _ like lawyers _ lobbied hard against
the sales tax expansion to their business. But fortune tellers and
vendors of piped-in music, who would also be taxed, weren't much in
evidence during the tax debate.
   David MacNeill, vice president of a company that sells
background music to malls and supermarkets, said he is concerned
about the tax. The waiting-room music industry, like everything
else, is feeling the squeeze from Massachusetts' slumping economy.
   ``Things are tight. Everybody's hustling like hell to keep
going,'' said MacNeill, of WCRB Sound System in Waltham.
   Stella Davis, a palm reader from Saugus, was surprised to learn
she and her colleagues face a 5 percent sales tax on any
fortunetelling bills that exceed $30.
   ``When you pay a tax and buy butter, you're getting something.
This is just a reading. They're not taking anything home except
just knowledge,'' Davis said.
   Davis said she is unlikely to pay the tax, since most of her
readings cost $10.
   But Davis' remark reflects a potential problem with the sales
tax _ a problem Gov. Michael S. Dukakis wants resolved before he
will sign the tax bill, aimed at raising $1.3 billion in its first
year.
   Under the Massachusetts Constitution, only commodities can be
taxed. Opponents of expanding the sales tax say services don't fall
under the definition of commodities. Dukakis has asked the state's
highest court to rule on the matter before he signs the bill.
   The state culled the list of services to be taxed from a list of
professions put out by the U.S. Census Bureau.
   ``The advantage of using it even though it seems silly when you
list them out is that it puts it all in black and white,'' said
Betsy Houghteling, a Department of Revenue spokeswoman.
   Although she acknowledged it may be difficult to track down
every last fortuneteller and yoga teacher, Houghteling said the
more obscure professions would bring in little money anyway.
   ``If we missed a palm reader, and that person didn't come
forward voluntarily, would the commonwealth miss a lot of money?
No,'' Houghteling said.
   But the lengthy list of services has left the impression with
some that everything is being taxed.
   Among the services whose clients would be subject to a 5 percent
tax: sponging textiles for tailors and dressmakers; cleaning and
reglazing of baking pans; mattress renovating and repair shops;
tent repair shops.
   ``There's no fortunetelling lobby so they can tax them,'' said
Peter Blanchard of Shrewsbury. ``How much money can that bring in?
I don't like it.'' But Caroline Clark, who works for an accounting
firm, had little problem with taxing palm readers.
   ``I feel that's fairly frivolous,'' Clark said.

<TEXT>
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens says he seeking
help at the economic summit of the world's richest nations for his
efforts to crack the lineup of a Japanese company's board of
directors.
   ``When I started out 16 months ago I said I wasn't asking for
help. I was just reporting my experience to Washington and to
Congress and people in the administration,'' Pickens told a news
conference Tuesday. ``About 16 months later I guess I am about
ready to say I would like to have some help.''
   Pickens said he planned to meet with summit delegation members
from the United States and Japan, but admitted that so far he
``wasn't on anyone's agenda.''
   His private investment firm, Boone Co., owns 26 percent of Koito
Manufacturing Co., a Japanese auto parts maker. Pickens
unsuccessfully has tried to gain a voice in the company by landing
four of Koito's 20 board seats.
   Pickens claims he has been shut out of Koito by Japan's
``keiretsu'' system, in which companies have formed closed links
through shared stock, financial and personnel links and corporate
strategies. He alleges Koito is part of the keiretsu surrounding
Toyota Motor Co., which is its second largest shareholder and the
largest buyer of its parts.
   At a June 28 Koito shareholders meeting, Pickens was denied
board seats and was defeated on other proposals, including larger
dividends and having shareholders vote on salary and retirement
benefits for board members.
   Koito claims Pickens is trying to ``greenmail'' the company into
buying his stock at premium prices. Company officials also contend
Pickens is acting on behalf of Japanese investor Kitaro Watanabe,
who they say has twice tried to greenmail them.
   When asked if he was in Houston seeking the help of Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Pickens replied:
   ``There's no doubt about it. He could help my cause. If he put
any pressure on the Toyota-Koito group and said, `Put the guy on
the board and let's see if he would be a good board member,' sure I
would like to see that call made by Kaifu. But I don't have any way
to apply that kind of pressure.''
   Pickens said he is more determined to buck the Japanese system
since being told ``Remember Pearl Harbor'' and ``Yankee go home''
at Koito's annual shareholders meeting last month.
   ``It was very shocking to me to go to a meeting where you own 26
percent of the company and be told things like that,'' he said.
``It's obvious the way they feel towards Americans. They don't want
anyone seeing how they run their business.''

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
said Tuesday that the number of employees in its Network Services
Division facing layoffs had been reduced to 4,300 because many
workers in the unit had opted for early retirement.
   The cuts, beginning in September, will affect workers in all
states except Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho and Vermont, said
AT&amp;T spokeswoman Lynn Newman. In New Jersey, where AT&amp;T is based,
139 jobs would be cut.
   There are 30,000 employees in the Network Services Division,
2,700 of them in New Jersey, Ms. Newman said. She said AT&amp;T expects
to pare the division's work force to 26,000 by next March.
   AT&amp;T, based in Basking Ridge, announced in March that it would
lay off about 6,000 Network Services workers as part of a
streamlining move.
   Network Services employees maintain AT&amp;T's long distance
network, attend to customer service chores and do clerical work.
AT&amp;T said automation had made some of the jobs obsolete.
   Ms. Newman said Tuesday that 1,600 workers accepted early
retirement in May, leaving about 4,300 ``surplus workers'' facing
layoffs.
   Laid off workers will be given the first chance at 2,200
vacancies in technical and clerical posts within the division, Ms.
Newman said, if they can qualify for jobs.
   The Communications Workers of America, which represents
union-covered Network Services employees, said the layoffs would
mean reduced services for customers.
   ``Obviously we are distressed, disturbed and repulsed at AT&amp;T
bowing at the altar of technology at the expense of customers and
employees,'' said Jim Irvine, a CWA vice president.
   AT&amp;T announced at the beginning of the year that it would
eliminate 13,000 jobs systemwide. The company has 280,000 employees
around the world, with 265,000 in the United States.
   AT&amp;T reported first-quarter earnings for 1990 of $668 million on
revenue of $8.9 billion. That compares with $594 million in
earnings on revenue of $8.6 billion in the same period last year.

<TEXT>
   A securities analyst fired for making
neative remarks about Donald Trump's new casino sued the real
estate tycoon in federal court Tuesday claiming Trump made
defamatory comments about him.
   Marvin B. Roffman, formerly a vice president with the
Philadelphia brokerage firm Janney Montomery Scott Inc., is seeking
more than $2 million in punitive and compensatary damages.
   Roffman, 50, was fired March 23, three days after a negative
critique in The Wall Street Journal about Trump's Taj Mahal Casino
Resort in Atlantic City, N.J. His case has raised questions about
the independence of securities analysts, who frequently comment
about companies and business developments.
   Roffman told the Journal that Trump's casino would flourish
immediately after it opened in April, but ``once the cold winds
blow from October to February, it won't make it. The market just
isn't there.''
   According to the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, Trump
sent a letter to Janney Montgomery President Norman T. Wilde that
said, ``For a long while I have thought of Mr. Roffman as an
unguided missile.''
   The lawsuit contends Trump's letter ``contained false and
defamatory material'' because Roffman's comments ``were not
outrageous; he is not a unguided missile, unprofessional ... and a
bad analyst.''
   Martin Sobol, Roffman's attorney, said his client believes he
was fired from his job because ``he was honest.'' ``He feels he was
wronged,'' Sobol said. Roffman declined to comment.
   John Barry, a Trump spokesman, said the lawsuit ``has absolutely
no basis'' and that Trump was free to express himself.
   ``This is still America. Mr. Trump is entitled to express his
opinion,'' he said. ``If Mr. Roffman thought the statements were
defamatory, why isn't he suing the publications in which they
appear?''
   The lawsuit quotes publications that reported Trump's comments
about Roffman as evidence of defamation.
   In the April 2 edition of Barron's, Trump said of Roffman:
``He's a very unprofessional guy, a hair trigger.'' In the May 7
edition of Fortune, Trump is quoted as saying: ``They got rid of a
bad analyst, a man with little talent,'' the lawsuit said.
   Trump threatened to sue Janney Montgomery unless Roffman
publicly retracted the comments or the firm fired the 16-year
veteran securities analyst. Roffman initially signed a letter of
apology, but withdrew it in a second letter and then was fired.
   Janney Montgomery contended Roffman was dismissed because he
violated company policy by issuing statements to the press that had
not been cleared or disseminated to the firm's clients.
   Wilde said in a statement that although Roffman violated company
policy about talking to the press, he was fired because he
disobeyed a supervisor's orders by sending the second letter to
Trump retracting his apology.
   ``In dismissing Mr. Roffman, we took measures to uphold industry
standards concerning the professional integrity of security
analysts,'' the statement said.
   Sobol said Roffman also would file a wrongful discharge claim
against Janney Montgomery with the New York Stock Exchange seeking
arbitration. Sobol said papers outlining the claim were mailed
Tuesday.
   Janney Montgomery is a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual
Life Insurance Co. The firm has 1,050 employees and 40 offices.
   Roffman's firing stirred widespread comment and turned him into
a highly sought subject for interviews, especially after it was
disclosed in recent weeks that Trump faced a cash crunch.
   Trump made a last-minute deal with bankers June 26 that allowed
him to meet the $43 million payment to holders of high-yield junk
bonds backing another casino, the Trump Castle.

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. said Tuesday
that a sharp decline in gaming income contributed to a 9 percent
drop in quarterly profits.
   For the three months ending June 30, the hotel-casino concern
earned $38.2 million, or 79 cents per share, compared with $42
million, or 87 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 3 percent to $274 million from $265 million.
   Overall income from hotels rose 3 percent to $44.8 million from
$43.6 million. Gaming income fell 21 percent to $29 million from
$36.8 million.
   Chairman Barron Hilton said results were mixed. In Chicago and
New York, one hotel did better while another declined. The Hilton
Hawaiian Village had excellent results, but the San Francisco
Hilton still hasn't recovered business lost from last fall's
earthquake, he said.
   The Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas benefited from a guestroom
tower addition, with room occupancy and income both up markedly.
But results at the Las Vegas Hilton, the company's other property
in Las Vegas, fell 56 percent.
   ``The property had exceptional results in the 1989 period, and
we recognized the quarterly comparison would be further challenged
by the increased competition in Las Vegas,'' Hilton said.
   For the first six months, Hilton profits rose 15 percent, to
$63.3 million, or $1.31 a share, from $55.1 million, or $1.14 a
share. Revenue rose 10 percent to $539 million from $490 million.

<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. has sued the Intelsat
consortium over who will pay for the bungled launch of a $157
million communications satellite.
   In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, Martin Marrietta
asks that it not be held liable for the fouled March 14 launch
involving one of its Titan rockets, which was sent into a low,
useless orbit.
   The company has accused the Washington-based Intelsat of making
``unlawfully coercive demands,'' and says Intelsat should be held
responsible for the mishap.
   ``The contract terms provided that Intelsat clearly had the
financial risk,'' said Philip Giaramita, a spokesman for Bethesda,
Md.-based Martin Marietta. ``That's really the heart of the
matter.''
   The suit, filed Friday, says Intelsat, a satellite operating
company, had threatened on July 3 to sue if Martin Marietta did not
pay damages for the launch. Intelsat is expected to argue that
Martin Marietta was grossly negligent in conducting the launch.
   Intelsat spokesman Tony Trujillo said the consortium would
comment only in its court reply to the chares, which must be made
within 60 days.
   In 1987, Martin Marietta signed a $112 million contract to
launch the satellite using a Titan booster. Intelsat paid
separately for the satellite.
   Satellite operators often take out commercial insurance against
a failure, but Intelsat did not, opting instead to set aside funds
of its own to cover such a contingency.
   The rocket lifted off routinely on March 14, but once it reached
space it failed to separate from the satellite. It was stranded in
a low, useless orbit.
   Intelsat is negotiating with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to have space shuttle astronauts attach a rocket to
the satellite that would send it up to its proper orbit. That would
cost the company about $90 million.
   Martin Marietta has blamed the failure on faulty electrical
engineering in its Titan booster, but contends its financial
responsibilities ended at liftoff. The suit said the contract
allowed Intelsat to request a replacement launch at a stipulated
price if the first one failed, and it has not done so.
   The suit said if Martin Marietta loses the lawsuit, if may
withdraw from the commercial space launch business.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Announces Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>

   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. said Tuesday
it is reorganizing its management structure because of financial
problems due to reduced defense spending.
   ``The company's financial performance in the past year makes it
clear that a change in the way we do business is necessary,''
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter President Tom Gunn said in a statement.
   Andrew Wilson, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St.
Louis, said the helicopter subsidiary recently reported a profit of
only 1{ percent so far this year.
   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter said it would create separate
divisions for its four helicopter lines. Management also has
accepted the resignation or early retirement of five executives.
   Other actions being taken include significant cost and budget
cutting measures, Gunn said, but he did not provide details.

<HEAD>Southmark Says Unsecured Creditors Approve Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp. said Tuesday preliminary results
indicate unsecured creditors have approved a bankruptcy court
reorganization plan that would leave the company as little more
than a Texas savings and loan.
   Southmark said final results of the voting would be released
Wednesday at a hearing on confirmation of the plan.
   ``If the plan is confirmed by the court, Southmark could emerge
from Chapter 11 later this month, just one year after its original
bankruptcy filing,'' the company said in a statement.
   The agreement is ``major hurdle number one,'' Southmark
spokeswoman Susan A. Seiter said. Creditors also have filed several
objections that must be dealt with in the confirmation hearing,
which she said could last several days.
   The reorganization plan would repay some unsecured creditors as
much as 30 cents on the dollar to less than 10 cents on the dollar.
Common stock holders would be left with little if anything.
   Unsecured creditors also would receive securities in the
reorganized Southmark. Creditors also will select new management
for the company.
   The plan also includes an agreement with federal thrift
regulators to inject $100 million in new capital into San Jacinto
Savings Association, the Houston-based thrift that would form the
core of the reorganized Southmark.
   Southmark became the nation's largest publicly traded real
estate company in the 1980s by buying and selling partnerships.
Much of the growth was financed with some $2 billion in high yield
bonds issued through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., itself currently
in bankruptcy proceedings.
   Southmark sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors last year
after failing to make interest payments on about $700 million in
bonds.

<HEAD>Lomas To Sell Three Life Insurance Companies For $165 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lomas Financial Corp. said Tuesday it would sell
its three life insurance companies to an Indiana insurance company
for $140 million in cash and $25 million in securities.
   The deal must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, which is
overseeing Lomas under Chapter 11.
   ``The life insurance businesses were performing well, but we
have determined that all of our resources should be focused on
Lomas's core businesses, principally mortgage banking and
information and systems services to the mortgage finance
industry,'' Lomas Financial Chairman Jess Hay said.
   ``Over the past several months we have been working to more
sharply focus, better define and grow our mortgage banking
business,'' he said.
   The firms involved are Jefferson National Life Insurance Co. of
Indianapolis; Union Life Insurance Co. of Little Rock, Ark.; and
First Continental Life &amp; Accident Co., Salt Lake City.
   The companies were sold to Conseco Capital Partners Limited
Partnership, formed by Conseco Inc., a life insurance and annuity
company based in Carmel, Ind.
   Lomas said it would retain office buildings valued at about $15
million that had housed some of the insurance operations.

<HEAD>USX, Two Steel Officials Convicted of Pension Scam</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with possible penalties, details on
1983 contract, pensions, union reaction; EDITS throughout; No

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal jury Tuesday convicted USX
Corp. and two United Steelworkers officials of conspiring to give
the union officials company pensions in exchange for approval of a
key labor contract.
   USX was convicted of all 14 counts of conspiracy, violating
federal labor law and mail fraud. Union District 36 director
Thermon Phillips and subdirector E.B. Rich each was convicted of
one count of conspiracy and one count of violating federal labor
law.
   Rich, 60, was acquitted of 10 counts of mail fraud. Ten mail
fraud charges against Phillips, 62, were dismissed earlier. The
verdict came on the 10th day of deliberations in U.S. District
Court.
   USX faces a maximum penalty of $4.1 million. Phillips and Rich
each face a maximum 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines at
sentencing Aug. 20.
   ``I think it shows the labor community that the public is not
going to sit still for skulduggery. They're going to demand honest,
upright labor negotiations,'' First Assistant U.S. Attorney Buddy
Kelly said.
   USX said it would appeal the verdict to the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. In a statement, the company maintained the
charges were ``the products of strained and erroneous
interpretations of complex statutes.''
   The government claimed at the 17-week trial the union officials
engaged in illegal negotiations in exchange for approval of a work
contract that cut wages and benefits but allowed USX's Fairfield
Works plant in Birmingham to reopen.
   The government alleged Phillips and Rich, former steel company
employees, illegally negotiated pensions for themselves and four
other union officials during talks in 1983.
   The government said Rich received a pension based on about 31
years of work but only worked there 13 years. Phillips' pension was
based on about 38 years of employment but he worked for the company
only from 1946-51, prosecutors alleged.
   Defense attorneys contended the pensions were not negotiated
during the talks and the defendants did not try to conceal them.
They said Rich and Phillips never made pensions a condition of
resolving the Fairfield negotiations.
   In 1984, USX, then U.S. Steel, changed its longstanding policy
against giving pensions to former employees who became labor
representatives. The company paid more than $300,000 in pensions to
Phillips, Rich and the other four union officers until the practice
was halted in 1988.
   Union president Lynn Williams and the union's top lawyer
testified that they read and filed a March 1985 U.S. Steel letter
reporting the pension policy change and the granting of six
pensions to unidentified union officers.
   Other union representatives testifying for the government said
they did not learn of the change, under which they may have been
eligible for company pensions, until 1987.
   The union said in a statement it expected the charges against
Rich and Phillips to be overturned on appeal, based on numerous
trial errors. Williams said the trial was ``more of an inquisition
than a search for the truth.''

<HEAD>Offers Early Retirement to Older U.S. Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering-Plough Corp. said Tuesday it would
offer early retirement to U.S. employees 55 years and older who had
been with the company at least 10 years.
   The voluntary plan would add five years of age and five years of
service in calculating pension benefits for about 900 eligible
employees, or 6 percent of the domestic work force.
   Schering-Plough develops, manufactures and markets
pharmaceutical and health care products worldwide.
   The company said similar plans would be offered on a limited
basis to employees in international subsidiaries. Executives and
Schering-Plough HealthCare Products hourly workers would not be
eligible.
   Most domestic employees who retired after Dec. 30, 1989, and
Maybelline employees who retired before the company's July 2 sale
of Maybelline, also will be eligible for the enhanced benefits, the
company said.
   The Maybelline division was sold to an affiliate of buyout
specialist Wasserstein Perella Partners LP.
