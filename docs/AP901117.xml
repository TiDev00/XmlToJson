   The music has improved, but Iraq's
propaganda pitch to American soldiers remains the same: You're
risking your life and wasting your time in Saudi Arabia.
   In daily broadcasts on what is now called the Voice of Peace,
Baghdad Radio's English-language programming contains warnings to
GIs that they risk coming down with ``craziness'' from long spells
in the desert.
   It tells them that their Arab allies will turn their guns on
U.S. soldiers instead of Iraqis. The messages also raise doubts
about the U.S. role in the region.
   GIs say they listen to the music, but tune out the commentary.
   In the tradition of Tokyo Rose during World War II and Hanoi
Hannah in Vietnam, Iraq started its blend of music, news and
propaganda when the U.S. military buildup began after Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In the beginning, the hourlong programs interspersed Arabic
music and Western big-band sounds with taunts.
   ``To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert,'' a voice
would say. ``Would you like to be one of the cripples who are only
lamented in the charity ceremonies?''
   Now, the programs are three hours long and the music is top-40
contemporary rock and oldies-but-goodies from the '60s and '70s.
   A female announcer, dubbed Baghdad Betty by the U.S. troops, or
a male colleague occasionally interrupts with comments such as:
   ``Let us be frank. We tell you that the embargo will not affect
us a bit. We could work and prepare food and stuff for ourselves
like our ancestors did some 6,000 years ago.''
   The embargo is a reference to trade sanctions imposed by the
United Nations after Iraq seized Kuwait.
   On Thursday, an announcer said: ``One of your pals even killed
himself a week ago, feeling terribly lonely. And two GIs quarrelled
with each other and one of them shot his colleague after they used
to be good friends.
   ``This is only normal. For one who is not accustomed to live in
the desert and is forced to do so for so long a time could easily
be driven to craziness. Then suicide is the only way out.''
   The announcer apparently was referring to a U.S. soldier found
dead in a shower on Nov. 8 and the shooting death of a Marine the
next day. The U.S. military said he was killed when a rifle
discharged accidentally as he slept.
   The military has acknowledged one suicide among the 46 Americans
who have died since Operation Desert Shield began Aug. 7. The rest
were all listed as accidental deaths.
   The Voice of Peace also claimed that a Saudi fighter pilot flew
his plane to asylum in Sudan.
   This, it said, illustrated the ``miserable situation in the
Saudi army.'' It said the kingdom's troops were unhappy with the
presence of the more than nearly 300,000 Western military personnel
in the gulf.
   If war breaks out, Arab soldiers ``will turn their weapons on
the enemy, and believe me, (the enemy) is not the brave Iraqi
army,'' the announcer said. ``I am not going to tell you who the
enemy is because I think you should know that by now.''
   Listening to the radio is one of the few diversions available to
the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, where alcohol is forbidden and the
native women are off limits.
   The Army has distributed 30,000 radios to the troops to help
them fight the boredom. The armed forces started the Desert Shield
Network last month and began broadcasting a progam of rock,
country, jazz and news.
   The Americans say they listen to Baghdad Betty and her band, but
are not unnerved by the propaganda.
   ``She's a pain in the butt. We just laugh her off,'' said Sgt.
1st Class Frank Brickhouse, 34, of Portsmouth, Va., and the Army's
82nd Airborne Division. ``She tries to mess with our minds, asking
us why did we come so far to die.''
   Said Staff Sgt. Joseph Herald, 34, of a field artillery unit
from Fort Lewis, Wash.: ``As long as she plays good music, who
cares what she has to say?''

   The logistics of bringing up to
200,000 more U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf region are daunting,
but the man in charge says things are going smoothly.
   ``It's going to be a lot easier this time,'' said Maj.-Gen.
William `Gus' Pagonis, comparing the new deployment with that of
the first troops dispatched by President Bush after Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Pagonis, the Army's logistics chief, started with a staff of 300
and now has about 16,000. His team also has more equipment.
   ``The first day we had four buses and about 10 trucks ... and we
got everybody to where they had to go,'' the 49-year-old general
said.
   Now the Army's logistical team has about 150 buses at its
disposal.
   The team also has learned from mistakes made in the initial
deployment, Pagonis said, but he refused to be more specific.
   Earlier reports indicated most of the new ground troops will
come from Germany, including at least two armored divisions with an
estimated 700 M1A1s, the U.S. Army's premier tank.
   Pagonis would not confirm which units are on their way to the
gulf, but he said many of the soldiers will travel from Europe.
   ``Advance parties have arrived,'' he said. ``Coordination is
taking place, and we'll start the flow, and we'll exceed or meet
the timetable - I'm very confident of that.''
   More than 3,000 planes have landed and unloaded passengers and
cargo in Saudi Arabia since the start of Desert Shield, and 150
ships have discharged cargo.
   There's been no backlog of ships waiting to be unloaded as there
was in Vietnam, Pagonis said. He credited the huge Saudi port
facilities, which have handled up to 10 ships at a time, and the
work of the U.S. military crews moving goods off the ships.
   The military also has developed a delivery system to get
supplies to troops scattered across Saudi Arabia's Eastern
Province, using transportation contracted locally.
   ``On any given day we have 700 host nation trucks on the road,
delivering goods,'' Pagonis said.
   Pagonis said the military receives 120 tons of mail per day. It
is moved from the central post office within 24 hours and delivered
to the troops in fifteen 40-foot-long trailer trucks.
   The Army is serving 150,000 hot cafeteria-style meals per day,
Pagonis said.
   Although many soldiers are still eating only MREs - the
ready-to-eat food that comes in plastic pouches - he said his goal
is to serve hot meals to all troops at least every two or three
days.

   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has
contended that one reason for his invasion of Kuwait was to obtain
a fair share of oil wealth from his neighbor.
   He has attempted to portray the invasion as a battle against the
rich to benefit the poor. But three months into the crisis, some of
the poorer Arab countries like Yemen, Jordan and Egypt have been
the first to suffer economic damage.
   No matter how the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved, the gap
between rich and poor in the Middle East is likely to persist and
may even widen.
   The Middle East has always been a scene of religious and tribal
disputes and of territorial ambitions. The division of wealth has
also fed nationalist movements and added to the conflicts in
countries like Lebanon, Iran and in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Countries that have little or no oil have always been jealous of
the oil-rich gulf nations. To them, even billions of dollars in
financial assistance over the years has seemed like a rich man's
tip to a waiter in a fancy restaurant.
   After Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2, the wealthy gulf states
joined the United States in condemning Iraq and helping to build an
American-led military force in the region.
   Syria and Egypt, two nations considered among the poorer Arab
countries, also have joined the force. They have received billions
of dollars in return, both from Saudi Arabia and the United States.
   But among the Palestinians in camps in Jordan and the
Israel-occupied territories, the dock workers of Algiers and Moslem
masses from Morocco to Yemen, there is support for Iraq.
   They believe Saddam has stood up to the Western powers and their
high-rolling Arab ``lackeys,'' and the Iraqi president has played
on these feelings in trying to gain support for the invasion.
   Here is a look at some key nations in the region and the role
economics plays in their position in the gulf crisis:
   -Saudi Arabia: The kingdom is reaping a multibillion-dollar
windfall as oil prices and production shoot up. The windfall is
exected to reach $50 billion by year's end.
   There's also a miniboom among businesses supplying the hundreds
of thousands of foreign troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   But Riyadh is spending billions of dollars to expand its
military and finance the foreign forces. It is helping Kuwaiti
refugees, and pledged $8.4 billion in aid by the end of 1991 to
countries hurt economically by the crisis, especially Jordan, Egypt
and Turkey. It anticipates an $8 billion budget deficit this year.
   -Jordan: Half of Jordan's exports went to Iraq, and complying
with U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq will cost at least $2
billion this year and $4 billion in 1991, officials estimate.
   Jordanian workers in Kuwait have lost an estimated $8 billion in
property and savings. Jordan has lost millions more in worker
remittances. Aqaba, which until August was a major port for Iraq,
has been idled. Hundreds of truck drivers are out of work, and
tourism income will be halved to about $230 million dollars.
   Many Jordanians support Saddam, and Saudi Arabia has responded
by cutting off oil supplies to the kingdom.
   -Syria: It's expected to lose about $4 billion because of the
crisis, officials say. In addition, it no longer gets money from
about 200,000 workers formerly employed in Kuwait. But U.S.
diplomats and analysts say Saudi Arabia has substantially increased
its financial assistance. By how much is not known.
   -Egypt: It will lose an estimated $4.5 billion this year because
of the crisis. But because Egypt produces more than it consumes,
exports this year should be boosted by $1 billion due to higher oil
prices.
   Anticipated losses include $2.4 billion in remittances from
300,000 Egyptians who have returned from Iraq and Kuwait, $1
billion in tourism, $300 million in Suez Canal transit tolls and
$820 million in lower exports and other services.
   The government must spend an estimated $700 million in salaries,
medical care and educational expenses for returning expatriates.
   The United States and several oil-rich Arab states have canceled
$14 billion of Egypt's $50 billion foreign debt. Cairo is
approaching other creditor countries with requests for
cancellations and writeoffs that would reduce it by another $12
billion.
   -Yemen: Diplomatic observers fear that the republic, formed last
May by the merger of North Yemen and South Yemen, will split
between tribes who owe allegiance to Saudi Arabia and radicals
supporting the president, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh. His government
has been sympathetic to Iraq.
   That position irked Saudi Arabia, the main benefactor of the
impoverished state. Riyadh suspended hefty financial assistance and
annulled privileges for more than 1 million Yemenis there. Half of
them have returned home, where there is little or no work for them.
   Newspapers say the Red Sea country is so hard-pressed
economically that it plans to expel 100,000 foreign workers.
   -The Palestinians: Iraq's invasion has reportedly deprived the
Palestine Liberation Organization, one of Baghdad's strongest
supporters, of $4 billion. That includes PLO holdings in Kuwaiti
banks and lost contributions from Arab states angry over the
organization's support for Iraq.

   Dorothy Spangenberg's laboratory is
jammed with 20,000 jellyfish - four times more than usual - because
of NASA's delay in launching the space shuttle Columbia.
   The biologist from Eastern Virginia Medical School plans to send
2,700 tiny, young jellyfish on a research mission to study their
metamorphosis in a gravity-free environment. Originally scheduled
for August, it was pushed into 1991 when the shuttle sprung
hydrogen leaks.
   Those leaks are fixed now, and NASA plans to launch Columbia in
early December on an astronomy mission. The flight with
Spangenberg's jellyfish, Columbia's next trip, is targeted for May.
   Spangenberg said she needs a large jellyfish supply so there
will be plenty at the right stage of development when it comes time
for the mission. She expects to have more than 25,000 jellyfish by
spring.
   ``I'll just keep growing them until we have enough, although I
don't know how to gauge how much is enough,'' she said. ``We're
going to get as many as we can between now and then.''
   Jellyfish polyps, an early form of the animal and about as long
as the lead tip of a pencil, occupy aquariums, dishes and flasks in
Spangenberg's Norfolk, Va., laboratory. The dishes and flasks are
inside incubators.
   Each container is filled with artificial sea water that lacks
iodine and thus prevents metamorphosis. Polyps can live
indefinitely at that stage in the laboratory and reproduce
continuously.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has sent up
monkeys, chimpanzees, rats, flies, bees, moths, spiders and fish.
The Soviets have carried a wider variety of animals into orbit,
including dogs, tortoises and guinea pigs. Neither country, though,
has ever flown jellyfish in space.
   What makes the marine creature so suitable for a nine-day
shuttle mission is that polyps develop into the more mature ephyra
stage in five to six days when iodine is added to their water.
   Ephyrae mature within four to six months into the final
developmental stage, called medusa. It's the form familiar to most
people - the 4- to 5-pound animals have bells, or humps, tentacles
and long mouth arms.
   Columbia's astronauts will videotape the jellyfish during the
flight, add iodine to the water of some of the specimens, and track
their growth. Spangenberg will analyze the data.
   ``We need a range of organisms to begin to put together a
picture to see if the response (in space) is similar from one
organism to the next,'' said NASA's Gary Jahns, the mission's
payload scientist. ``Jellyfish are a single point in that
picture.''
   The Spacelab life sciences mission, which will include a rat
study and 18 other experiments, originally was scheduled for late
1986, then early 1987. A month after NASA approved Spangenberg's
experiment application in December 1985, Challenger exploded and
the shuttle program ground to a 2{-year halt.
   The delays have proved beneficial for Spangenberg. In October,
she discovered another kind of jellyfish cell in the ephyra, a
gravity receptor that helps the creatures maintain direction and
balance somewhat like the human inner ear.
   Each jellyfish gravity receptor has a sac of calcium sulphate
crystals, just as each inner ear has calcium-containing crystals.
Spangenberg is sending up about 150 ephyrae to see if any calcium
is lost in the weightlessness of space. Thirty white rats on the
shuttle will be observed in a related study.
   Such knowledge is expected to improve scientists' understanding
of calcium loss in astronauts during flight.
   ``The cells of the jellyfish are basically very similar to cells
of higher animals,'' Spangenberg said. ``I look at them as a good
model system for the study of a variety of biological problems.''

   The Associated Press on Friday erroneously
reported the scope of warranty requirements for motor vehicle
emission-control equipment under the new clean air law in a summary
of the law's provisions.
   The warranty is being extended to 80,000 miles from 50,000 miles
for certain equipment, not to 100,000 miles for all such equipment.
   Under the new law, manufacturers must give a warranty of eight
years or 80,000 miles beginning with 1995 model cars for three
major emission control components - catalytic converters, onboard
diagnostic devices and electronic control systems.
   For the remaining emission control system devices, the warranty
period is limited to two years or 24,000 miles, no change from
current requirements.
   The law does require manufacturers to build converters,
diagnostic systems and electronic controls tostandards equivalent
to a 100,000-mile life instead of the 50,000 miles now required.

   Now playing in the American work place - The Slump That Stole
Christmas.
   In a footnote to a year of corporate layoffs and cutbacks, a
slew of companies are cutting back on the all-expense-paid,
end-of-year Christmas bash.
   This year, corporate party-goers will find less caviar and
French pate. Shrimp has gone out to sea. Bid adieu to open bars and
champagne. Grab a beer or a glass of wine.
   Others won't be so lucky. Many employers, pressed by tight
budgets and economic uncertainty, are telling employees they'll
have to pay for their own celebrations. Some extravagant company
affairs have been eliminated.
   ``I'm finding, and a lot of people in the area are finding, that
a lot of companies are canceling parties because they have layoffs
and can't justify spending money on a party,'' said John Caruso,
owner of one of the biggest corporate caterers in the economically
hard-hit Boston area.
   In New York, NBC, squeezed by an industry-wide advertising slump
this fall, has axed its Yule parties for news and other network
divisions.
   ``I certainly think economics played a part,'' said one NBC
executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, the
executive added, ``I think everybody's sort of relieved'' from not
having to make the round of parties. ``It was getting out of
control.''
   Wall Street has been particularly merciless in slicing frills.
   ``Basically in the downtown district - the law, bank, security
and financial services industry - there's a major statement being
made on holiday parties,'' said Adam Weiss, director of sales at
the swank Bridgewaters restaurant in lower Manhattan's South Street
Seaport, which generally plays host to 18,000 party-goers in
December largely from Wall Street.
   Noticeably absent from this year's roster of bash-throwers:
fallen junk-bond giant Drexel Burnham Lambert, which threw a fancy
350-person party at Bridgewaters last Christmas - just months
before it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors.
   For some companies, the cheerless season follows a trend that
began in recent years. For example, two Christmases ago, Security
Pacific Merchant Bank threw an affair with disc jockey, open bar
and a spread of international food featuring a sushi chef on an
entire floor of its building with about 400 employees in
attendance.
   But last year's party, while held at a stylish club on
Manhattan's upper West Side, had ``almost no food and much fewer
people who attended,'' recalled one employee, noting that the party
was restricted to workers in the firm's profit-making groups.
   In Atlanta, a spokesman at Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said
partly because the company owns its favorite party spot, the Omni
Hotel, it can still afford this year to throw its usual big bash
for about 1,700 employees.
   But one major Atlanta caterer said the company has slimmed its
budget for smaller departmental parties, many of which require
party-goers to pick up the tab for items like soft drinks.
   Caterers say the art of party-throwing increasingly has become a
wait-and-see affair. Instead of reserving catering halls and
holiday bands several months in advance, many companies have yet to
commit themselves.
   The idea is to wait for end-of-the-year profit statements before
deciding whether there's enough leeway for a party.
   Uncertainty is this season's dominant holiday theme. Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., for example, informed workers it was
canceling its major divisional Christmas party and then announced
it would have it after all, caterers said - but in February instead
of December.
   Another way to cut back: Go for substitutions on the menu.
   With caviar costing up to $395 for 14 ounces, a fish-egg-laden
party supplied by New York's Zabar's delicatessen can cost $30 to
$40 a head. But for a mere $20 a pound, smoked salmon might slice
the overall cost to $10 a head.
   ``Instead of chateau briand it might be top sirloin,'' said Lori
Moser, one of New York's top party-throwers. ``We have even done
some wonderful beef stews this year.''

<HEAD>San Diego Seen on Inside Track for '92 Gathering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Houston is the president's home town. New
Orleans is fun. Cleveland is blue collar. Tampa-St. Petersburg is
senior citizens and the Sun Belt. San Diego boasts the biggest
cache of electoral votes.
   That, in a nutshell, sums up arguments for the five contenders
to play host to the 1992 Republican National Convention.
   Current handicapping makes San Diego the front-runner to win
that competition.
   In part, the southern California city benefits from problems
peculiar to two of its rivals - problems named David Duke and Ann
Richards.
   GOP officials insist that former Ku Klux Klansman Duke's
standing as Louisiana's most prominent - if unwanted - Republican
does not disqualify New Orleans, nor does the prospect of Ms.
Richards as the newly elected Democratic governor of Texas
eliminate Houston.
   But they concede that Duke and Ms. Richards are among the
political factors that will be weighed as the party decides where
to gather to open President Bush's re-election campaign.
   So far, President Bush has expressed no public preference and
aides say he isn't likely to do so. All it takes is a nod from the
president toward one city to insure its selection.
   ``He has said he wants to go to the place that makes the most
sense,'' said Mary Matalin, executive director of the Republican
National Committee. ``He has not given us a preference one way or
the other.''
   The party's site-selection committee plans to make its
recommendation at the end of this month. But the final decision
won't be announced until early next year.
   The Democrats already have chosen New York as the site of their
1992 convention.
   No one disputes the importance of California, which will have 54
electoral votes in 1992, one-fifth of the 270 needed to win the
presidency.
   Neither is there any argument with San Diego's ideal weather.
   The problems cited most often are the size of the convention
hall and money.
   San Diego's hall is the smallest of the five in contention, but
backers contend it is as large as the hall in Dallas where
Republicans met to renominate Ronald Reagan in 1984. There also is
talk about holding the final session of the convention in the
California city's Jack Murphy Stadium.
   Money could be a greater problem. Normally the major exporter of
political money to both major parties, California will have little
to spare in 1992 when the state will have two Senate races as well
as contests for seven new House seats.
   When Republican Pete Wilson takes office as governor in January,
one of his first acts will be appointing someone to succeed him in
the Senate. Wilson's choice then will have to run in 1992 for the
remaining two years of his Senate term.
   In addition, 1992 is the year the seat held by retiring
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston comes up for election.
   New Orleans was the site of the 1988 convention that nominated
Bush for president. The Superdome is big enough for two
conventions. Also working in the city's favor is what one party
source called ``the fun factor.''
   But the Republicans are concerned about the potential for Duke,
a state legislator and former Klan leader, to grab too big a share
of the television coverage.
   Despite efforts by national party officials to repudiate him,
Duke ran for the Senate in 1990 as a Republican and garnered 44
percent of the vote in an unsuccessful bid to oust Democratic Sen.
J. Bennett Johnston.
   If Bush had a favorite, most Republicans assume it would be
Houston, his adopted home town. But if the Republicans meet there,
Richards would be the governor who would greet them.
   Could the news media resist writing and broadcasting excerpts
from her scathing keynote address at the 1988 Democratic
convention?
   ``Poor George,'' she said. ``He can't help it. He was born with
a silver foot in his mouth.''
   Cleveland has its supporters, especially after Ohio elected a
Republican governor in 1990. Choosing it would enable the party to
showcase its commitment to blue-collar Americans, a voting group
that felt more comfortable with Reagan than with Bush.
   Tampa-St. Petersburg has the drawback of bringing the convention
to a state that is considered a Bush stronghold, even though
Florida voters ousted their Republican governor in 1990 in favor of
Democrat Lawton Chiles.

<HEAD>Thousands More Reserves Called Up For Operation Desert Shield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army and Marine Corps are calling an
additional 15,092 reservists to active duty because of the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The latest call-ups announced Friday bring to 51,587 the total
number of reservists activated from all military services since
President Bush first authorized their use for Operation Desert
Shield in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It is now the largest call to active duty for American
citizen-soldiers since the Berlin crisis in 1961, when about
150,000 reservists were activated.
   Also on Friday the Marine Corps said it was preparing to send to
the gulf for the first time a tank battalion with M-1A1 tanks, the
most modern U.S. battle tank. Marines now in the gulf are equipped
with less-powerful M-60 tanks.
   The Marines said the 2nd Tank Battalion is now undergoing
special training before deploying to the gulf with 58 M-1A1 tnks.
Marine tank units had not been scheduled to switch to the newer
tanks until next year, but the need for firepower to offset Iraq's
numerical superiority in tanks prompted a quicker switch, said Lt.
Col. Ron Stokes.
   In a related development, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
announced he was extending a freeze on military construction
projects except those needed for Desert Shield.
   Cheney's announcement drew criticism from some lawmakers. Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the House Armed Services
military installations subcommittee, complained that Cheney was
holding up projects already approved by Congress while starting
others in the gulf without consulting Congress.
   Bush on Thursday used emergency powers to give Cheney the
authority to bypass Congress on necessary Desert Shield
construction.
   The Army said it was ordering 14,006 National Guard and Army
Reserve members from 35 states to active duty. It said in excess of
12,000 more would be called up within days, including the first
combat reserve units to be activated in the gulf crisis.
   The Marine Corps said it was calling up combat reservists,
including 324 members of the 8th Tank Battalion in Rochester, N.Y.,
and 109 members of Company B, 4th Tank Battalion in Yakima, Wash.
Both of those units will join Marine forces that are scheduled to
deploy to the gulf to perform combat missions.
   The Army did not say how many of its reservists would be sent to
the gulf.
   The latest Army call-up, which is effective today, is the first
major activation of reserve forces since the Bush administration on
Wednesday raised the ceiling on the number of reserves that could
be used for the campaign against Iraq. The original limit of 52,500
set in August was raised to 125,000.
   The Army said that for ``operational security reasons'' it could
not say exactly what missions would be performed by the latest
group of reserves it called up. However, it appeared from the units
described in the announcement that they will be used for fuel and
supply transport, medical services and other support roles.
   Cheney said last week that the Army would activate three
National Guard combat units, although they would undergo desert
warfare training in the United States before a final decision is
made on whether to send them to the gulf.
   Those three units - the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of
Georgia, the 155th Armored Brigade of Mississippi and the 256th
Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana - were among the reserve
units put on alert Friday for later call-up.
   It is expected that the three units, accounting for about 12,000
troops, will be officially ordered to active duty next week.
   Meanwhile Friday, Bush formally notified Senate President Pro
Tem Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
of his latest troop deployments.
   ``In my Aug. 9 letter, I indicated that I did not believe that
involvement in hostilities was imminent'' and that the buildup
would facilitate a ``peaceful resolution of the crisis,'' the
president wrote. ``My view on these matters has not changed.''
   The War Powers Act of 1973, which no president has accepted as
constitutional, requires notice of overseas deployments if
hostilities are imminent and mandates a withdrawal of troops if
Congress does not approve the action within 90 days. The act has
not been invoked in the gulf crisis.

   A judge drew the names of mayoral
candidates out of a jar to settle a tied election on this popular
vacation town on the island of Crete. But the loser says he'll
appeal.
   Leftist leader Dimitris Kounenakis won Friday's drawing. ``I
believe luck confirmed reality - that we were the better party,''
he said.
   Kounenakis and the conservative candidate, Giorgos Menagakis,
each received 1,742 votes in October elections. A court in the city
of Iraklion ruled that the election should be decided by lottery.
   The two candidates' names were put into a jar and drawn by a
magistrate in the nearby town of Neapolis. Court sources said this
was the first time a town's mayor was chosen in this way.
   But Kounenakis may still not be able to begin his four-year term
on Jan. 1.
   ``The decision is unjust and wrong. We will appeal,'' his rival,
Menagakis, told government television.

<TEXT>
   The ``Keating Five'' senators struck emotional
chords in defense of their integrity as the Senate Ethics Committee
gave them their first chance to publicly respond to a special
counsel's influence-peddling evidence against them.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., about to begin radiation therapy
for prostate cancer, invoked the names of his son and sister Friday
and said that with his career nearing an end, ``my cherished
reputation'' was on the line in the savings and loan affair.
   `With all my heart and soul, I want to make very clear ... I
engaged in no unethical conduct,'' the 76-year-old Cranston said.
``You know that I broke no law. You know that I broke no Senate
rule. You know that I pocketed no money.''
   Equally spirited declarations were offered by three of the other
four senators: Republican John McCain of Arizona, and Democrats
John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   The fifth senator, Democrat Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, gets
his chance to make an opening statement on Monday, when the panel
holds its third day of hearings. After he speaks, committee special
counsel Robert S. Bennett will begin presenting witnesses and
offering evidence.
   Although no formal charges are pending against any of the five,
the hearings center around their efforts on behalf of Charles J.
Keating Jr., former owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan,
whose bailout is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.
   Keating was a major contributor to campaigns or causes of each
senator, and each met with federal banking regulators when Keating
was seeking waiver of investment limitations and other regulatory
actions.
   ``John Glenn does not peddle influence, period,'' Glenn said
when his turn came.
   ``At no time did I ask for special treatment for anyone,'' he
said. ``At no time did I trade favors or perform actions in return
for money. I acted honorably, I behaved honestly and I have neither
tainted my own reputation nor tarnished the reputation of this
body.''
   Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, offered the
longest personal defense - talking for an hour and a half without
interruption about a case he compared to an ``exploding cigar going
off in my face.''
   ``I believe my conduct was absolutely proper,'' Riegle said.
``... It was ethical in every respect.''
   McCain had received the easiest time Thursday when Bennett
outlined evidence involving each. Bennett concluded he found no
evidence of improper conduct by the Arizona Republican.
   McCain spoke briefly on his own behalf, then allowed his lawyer
to make a point-by-point rebuttal. Later, McCain took telephone
calls about the case from viewers live on the C-SPAN cable
television network.
   ``I know I acted ethically and properly and in compliance with
all applicable standards of conduct, including my own,'' McCain
told the committee.
   Bennett concluded his opening description of evidence - a
statement that ran more than seven hours over two days - by
detailing Cranston's efforts on behalf of Keating.
   ``On approximately four separate occasions, Senator Cranston
accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from Mr.
Keating'' for his campaigns or voter registration drives to which
he was closely associated, Bennett said.
   ``Each of these four occasions was linked by time and
circumstance to a request by Mr. Keating for assistance'' with
federal bank regulators, Bennett said.
   In his response, Cranston said his efforts were not tied to
Keating's money and that Bennett was suggesting an ethical standard
had been violated where none existed.
   ``The fact is that the Senate does not have any rules like those
Mr. Bennett seems to want,'' Cranston said. ``If it did, senators
would be afraid to act on behalf of any constituents who have
contributed or who may contribute in the future.''
   To underscore his point, Cranston presented a list of all 100
senators and the staff members each has designated under Senate
rules as authorized to solicit campaign contributions as well as
conduct Senate business.
   ``If you decide that it's improper to take a lawful and proper
action at any time in behalf of someone who has contributed legally
and properly, then every senator, including every member of this
committee, had better run for cover, because every senator has done
it,' Cranston said.
   Cranston has said he will not run for re-election when his term
is up in 1992, and he has given up his leadership post of Senate
majority whip.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's approval rating has dropped
below the 50 percent mark for the first time in polling done for
the Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press.
   Bush's approval rating in the Times Mirror poll slipped to 49
percent from 76 percent in August, 68 percent in September and 55
percent in October, the center said Friday.
   But those questioned still favored Bush, by a 50-37 percent
margin, over New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, his most frequently
mentioned potential 1992 Democratic rival.
   In another finding, little more than one-third of the people who
didn't vote this year said they wish they had and about one-tenth
said they were glad they didn't.
   Pollsters asked people whether they had the opportunity to vote
on Nov. 6 or whether something came up that kept them from voting.
   Eighty-two percent said they voted and 8 percent said they
didn't.
   Of those who didn't vote, 36 percent said they wished they had
and 13 percent said they were glad they didn't. Forty-five percent
said they had mixed feelings. The pollsters did not ask why.
   The polling group also asked voters to grade the press on its
coverage of this year's political campaign. The average grade was a
C-plus, compared with a D-plus average in a poll after the 1988
presidential campaign.
   The Democratic Party also improved its grade, moving up from an
average of C-minus in 1988 to a C. Republicans averaged a C both
times.
   The results were based on telephone interviews conducted among
1,208 adults, 18 or older, from Nov. 8 to 11. The error
attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus
3 percentage points, the polling group said.
   Times-Mirror is a news media organization whose publications
include the Los Angeles Times.

<HEAD>News Service Employees Accept Temporary 35 Percent Cut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Union employees of United Press International
are giving the financially distressed news service ``time to find a
new home'' by accepting a 35 percent pay cut for 90 days while the
company seeks a buyer.
   Members of the Wire Service Guild, in two weeks of balloting,
voted by a 62 percent majority to accept the salary reduction.
Ballots were counted Friday at WSG headquarters in New York.
   ``Given the extremely tough circumstances in which we are
working, this is a courageous and responsible act by journalists
who want to support each other and who hope to see UPI restored,''
said Pieter VanBennekom, executive vice president of the
Washington-based news service.
   ``This gives us the time to find a new home for UPI,'' he said.
   Kevin Keane, WSG president, said, ``Through the vote our members
demonstrated a willingness to make another huge sacrifice to keep
UPI alive.''
   The weekly salary of a top-scale newsperson at UPI will be
reduced from $690 to $448. A first-year newsperson will be paid
$234 a week, down from $360.
   The pay reductions take effect today and will end Feb. 14.
   UPI already had cut management salaries by the same percentage
for 90 days.
   VanBennekom said more than a dozen organizations had expressed
preliminary interest in purchasing all or part of the 83-year-old
news service since plans for its sale were announced. He did not
identify the organizations.
   At a meeting with the Washington staff after the vote,
VanBennekom said UPI has been losing as much as $2.5 million a
month, but has made some progress in reducing its losses, according
to a UPI staffer.
   The staffer, who took notes during the meeting, spoke on the
condition he not be identified.
   He quoted VanBennekom as saying, ``A sale must be accomplished
by the end of January. We are confident we can affect a sale before
the end of January.''
   The executive vice president was also quoted as saying that at
least one written letter of intent had been received for purchase
of the company.
   WSG Secretary-Treasurer Chris Dahl said about 310 UPI employees
are members of the guild. He said the total work force covered by
the union contract, counting those who are not members, is close to
400.
   The numbers voting on each side were not disclosed.
   The news service, founded in 1907 as United Press, has changed
ownership three times in eight years. The present owner is
Infotechnology Inc., parent firm to a number of high-tech ventures.
   Infotechnology announced this month it hopes to sell its
companies by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Rape Case of Interior Secretary's Son Sent to Grand Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman says a shotgun-toting Robert
Jeffrey Lujan, son of Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, loomed over
her in the nude, talked endlessly and forced her to go to a hallway
outside his parents' apartment before he raped her in her own bed.
   General District Court Judge Robert T.S. Colby on Friday ordered
the 28-year-old Lujan, who has previous convictions for cocaine
possession and drunken driving, held without bond on a rape charge
while a grand jury considers the case.
  Defense attorney Robert Stanley Powell told reporters he expects
the grand jury to indict his client Dec. 3, even though ``this was
a consentual relationship between two people who lived in the same
building and knew one another.''
   But the alleged victim, the sole witness at Lujan's preliminary
hearing, said the first time she ever saw the defendant was when
she awakened at 4:41 a.m. Sunday, not long after she had arrived
home from an evening of partying. The woman, 48, said she saw a man
with a shotgun looming over her bed. ``As time went by, I realized
he had no clothes on,'' she said.
   Powell repeatedly questioned the woman's sobriety that night.
She acknowledged having at least two glasses of wine at a party she
attended for several hours, then at least two Kier Royales - a mix
of champagne and French liqueur - in a 2 a.m. visit to a Washington
nightspot.
   By her account, Lujan told her he picked the locks to her
apartment with a hairpin and entered it to hide from building
security, for reasons he never explained. ``I assumed it had
something to do with drugs,'' she said. ``He said he wanted to
hide, but found me attractive and wanted to do more.''
   The woman said they talked for about two hours, during which
Lujan alternately handled the shotgun or left it in a corner of the
room. Then Lujan, after donning his jeans and allowing her to put a
robe over her nightgown, ordered her to accompany him up the
stairwell to the eighth floor.
   There, he declared ``This is so stupid, I shouldn't be doing
this. My boss is going to kill me,'' and took her back to her own
apartment, she said.
   Lujan, a house painter, lives with his parents on the eighth
floor of the apartment building in this Washington suburb.
   Upon returning to her efficiency apartment on the third floor,
the woman said, Lujan repeatedly asked her to take her clothes off,
finally demanding that she do so. When she complied, he performed
oral sex on her and then forced her into intercourse, she said.
   She said Lujan left the apartment about 9 a.m., after which she
went to the front desk and summoned police.
   Lujan, who was arrested Wednesday after police scoured the
building with a composite sketch based on her description, sat
impassively throughout the hour-long hearing, as his mother and two
sisters looked on.
   Defense attorney Powell insisted the woman had known Lujan and
had invited him to her apartment after a chance encounter in the
elevator after each had returned separately from a night out
drinking. But she denied that account.
   Powell acknowledged that police had found a shotgun in the Lujan
apartment but disputed that the young man had ever carried it
during his time with the woman. ``I would suggest to the court that
a lot of these things happened in her mind,'' he said.
   But Colby refused the defense attorney's request for bond and
release of his client to the custody of a local minister who
operates a halfway house. A $2,000 bond was revoked a day earlier.
   Lujan was imprisoned for several months in 1983 for possession
of cocaine and use of a telephone in a drug transaction. He served
a one-year term in 1987 for drunken driving and driving on a
suspended license.

<HEAD>Budget Chief Says Social Security Will Survive Intact for Affluent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is considering a new
assault on government spending by trimming government benefits paid
to affluent Americans, but the White House budget chief wants to
make clear that Social Security will not be touched.
   Richard Darman, director of the president's Office of Management
and Budget, said benefit reductions going to well-to-do Americans
in a variety of programs would be seriously reviewed as the
administration prepares its fiscal 1992 budget request to Congress.
   He specifically mentioned subsidy payments to farmers and the
giant Medicare program that provides health care for the elderly,
two areas where the administration has tried in the past to achieve
cost savings.
   But Darman branded as inaccurate reports quoting unnamed
administration officials as saying that the administration was also
looking for savings in the Social Security program.
   He said the administration had no intention of ``tinkering with
Social Security. We are not doing that as part of this review, but
everything else is certainly in the equation.''
   In remarks Friday before the Council for Excellence in
Government, Darman said the administration was seriously studying
proposals to trim government benefits paid to affluent Americans.
He suggested that part of the savings could be used to boost
payments made to lower income individuals.
   ``There are lots of ways you can do that and it varies from
program to program,'' Darman said.
   The administration in the past has tried to make higher income
individuals pay more for their Medicare health insurance and to
reduce subsidy payments received by high-income farmers.
   However, those proposals have been defeated in Congress and
Darman acknowledged in his speech that it was difficult to attack
benefits received by the middle class because of their political
might.
   But he said the administration may well renew the effort in next
year's budget because of added leverage it received in the
deficit-cutting bill approved by Congress last month.
   That measure, which calls for $492 billion in savings over the
next five years, included new ``pay-as-you-go'' enforcement
mechanisms that Darman said should make it easier for the president
to block unwanted spending.
   ``We may be able to break free, somewhat, from the consume-now,
promise-to-pay-later approach that characterized the '70s and
'80s,'' Darman said.
   But even with the new deficit-cutting procedures in place,
Darman predicted that the deficit for the current fiscal year would
hit a record somewhere between $250 billion and $300 billion.
   The deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, was
$220.4 billion, just short of the all-time high of $221.1 billion
set in 1986.
   Darman blamed the higher red ink on a variety of factors,
including the weakening economy and the rising cost of the savings
and loan bailout.
   The economy's weakness was brought home to the White House this
week in a seriesof meetings President Bush held with his own
advisers and a group of 20 top business executives brought in to
brief the president.
   Darman, who attended the sessions, said the consensus among both
the president's advisers and the executives was that the economy
was in a downturn, a word Bush himself used in a television
interview Thursday.
   Amoco Corp. Chairman Dick Marrow told reporters, ``There is a
general feeling that we are either in a recession or very close.''
   Darman said the purpose of the hastily scheduled meetings Bush
has held on the economy was to develop a strategy for cushioning
the shock of any downturn.
   He said the president will probably make recommendations for
stimulating economic growth in his budget, due to be submitted to
Congress in February, but that no decisions were likely before late
December ``at the earliest.''

   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, new doors have
opened in the West for some of Saddam Hussein's opponents, but
these exiles remain politically divided and scattered around the
world.
   Opposition leaders, some of whom have opposed the Iraqi
president for more than 20 years, say governments in Washington,
London and Paris are finally starting to pay attention to them.
   ``A few months ago I couldn't hustle up a cup of coffee in the
U.S. State Department,'' said Saad Jabr, leader of the New Umma
(Nation) Party, a liberal democratic group. ``Now I am invited to
lunch and they want to hear what we have to say.''
   Jabr met senior administration officials during a visit to
Washington in August, and the Washington Post published an
interview with him.
   ``Jabr and his group are well known to people here and they have
no qualms about meeting with him,'' State Department spokeswoman
Diane Salisbury said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said there had been regular
contact with some Iraqi opposition groups before the Aug. 2
invasion. The number of groups seeking meetings has risen since the
invasion and the Foreign Office is happy to hear their views, said
the spokesman.
   Jabr estimates about 200,000 Iraqis are in Britain. Most exiles
keep a low profile, fearing persecution by Saddam's secret
services.
   Saddam was a leader of a coup that took power in Iraq in 1968;
he has violently crushed dissent since becoming the country's top
leader in 1979.
   Hoshyar Zebari of the Kurdish Democratic Party said Iraqi Kurds
were well-received in September when they met in Paris with a
deputy of French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   ``Belatedly, Western governments are recognizing Saddam has to
be moved, and they are encouraging opposition groups inside and
outside Iraq to stand up and be counted,'' said Middle East analyst
Heino Kopietz, formerly of the International Institute of Strategic
Studies in London.
   But the opposition movement remains badly divided. The broad
ideological sweep of the opposition groups, some of them historical
enemies, makes a united front difficult. They have also been
weakened by Saddam's purges.
   Kopietz said the Iraqi resistance has suffered from the lack of
a charismatic leader, and he doesn't see these groups leading
Saddam's overthrow.
   More than two months of talks among 25 opposition groups in the
Syrian capital, Damascus, have produced agreement only on the
necessity of toppling Saddam, not on what comes afterward.
   Communists and Moslems have fallen out over the wording of
communiques: the Moslems want to include references to Allah; the
communists refuse.
   Iraqi opposition groups fall loosely into four camps: the
democrats, who have tended to congregate in London; Arab
nationalists and dissidents from Iraq's ruling Ba'athist Party who
consider Damascus their home; Shia Islamic groups centered in
Tehran, and the Kurds, a long-oppressed minority fighting for
autonomy against Baghdad. Kurdish political parties have
representatives in many countries.
   Attempts to unite have foundered on differences of allegiance
and approach.
   Jabr's New Umma Party is not taking part in the Damascus talks
because it believes the venue is not neutral, and that Syria's
President Hafez Assad may seek to exploit the crisis to lead the
Arab world.
   Jabr is also suspicious of the Iranian mullahs' influence on
Iraq's Muslim opposition groups. ``When the Mullahs say `Jump,' the
Muslims say `How high?''' he said.
   The opposition all want Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait, but Arab
nationalists and others demand the simultaneous withdrawal of the
U.S.-led force from the Persian Gulf. Some democratic groups want
the United States to help democratize the region after Kuwait is
freed.
   The opposition is also divided on whether a viable opposition
exists inside Iraq.
   ``Don't let anyone tell you there is an organized opposition
inside Iraq,'' said Jabr. ``Ninety percent of people inside Iraq
oppose Saddam, but after 22 years of terror it is a silent
opposition.''
   But Zebari said the Kurd's internal front, at least, is still
active. ``There are several thousand guerrilla fighters inside the
country who are fighting on and thousands more in Iran and
Turkey,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Vetoes Chemical Arms Bill, Signs Numerous Other Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a last-minute flurry of
domestic business before heading to Europe, vetoed legislation to
thwart chemical weapons proliferation, barred U.S. mineral activity
in Antarctica and acted on a spate of other bills passed by
Congress.
   The president vetoed a measure designed to crack down on
countries and companies that traffic in chemical arms, but at the
same time he issued an executive order he said would achieve the
same goals.
   The order imposes new export controls on chemical and biological
weapons and provides sanctions against violators.
   In a statement, Bush said his major objection to the legislation
``is not the requirement of sanctions, but the rigid way in which
they are imposed.''
   ``The mandatory imposition of unilateral sanctions as provided
in this bill would harm U.S. economic interest and provoke friendly
countries who are essential to our efforts to resist Iraqi
aggression,'' he said.
   The bill Congress sent Bush also would have forbidden trade with
Cuba by overseas subsidiaries of U.S. companies, a provision that
the State Department opposed.
   Bush directed sanctions against foreign countries and their
citizens who use chemical or biological weapons or ``are making
substantial preparations to use such weapons'' or have deeloped or
stockpiled such weapons in violation of international law.
   The sanctions include cutting off U.S. foreign aid and arms
exports, blocking loans to the country from international lending
organizations and restricting U.S. imports from the country.
   The president signed the Antarctic Protection Act of 1990 and
eight other environmental measures.
   The new law bans indefinitely U.S. mineral activities in
Antarctica until Congress approves a yet-to-be-negotiated
multinational minerals pact for the frozen continent.
   Environmental groups want Bush to commit the United States to
join France, Australia and New Zealand in pushing to make
Antarctica a permanently protected refuge.
   U.S. officials oppose the permanent ban, urging instead an
international compact for a limited moratorium on oil drilling and
other minerals development. Environmentalists contend that the
indefinite ban merely gives industry time to prepare the technology
for eventual development and mining.
   Bush also signed measures to:
   -Establish the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary,
designating 2,600 square miles off the keys as a national marine
sanctuary.
   -Establish national wildlife refuges in the 18,000-acre Bayou
Cocodrie in Louisiana and the 7,500-acre Walkill River area of New
Jersey, and finance additional marine research programs and
stepped-up enforcement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   -Designate 83,100 acres in southern Nevada's Mojave Desert as
the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation area.
   -Nearly triple the size of the Coastal Barrier Resource System
by adding 818,000 acres along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and
Great Lakes coasts. The measure also limits federal funds for
development within the coastal barrier areas and requires that any
federal property in the coastal barrier regions be transferred to
the system.
   -Provide grants and training to teachers for environmental
education and create an office of environmental education at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   -Fund research on the global warming trend. The administration,
bucking many of its allies, contends there is insufficient
scientific data to confirm that the Earth is slowly warming due to
gaseous emissions. Rather than committing itself to a reduction of
those gases, the administration is putting more money into
research.
   -Assist in the cleanup of toxic pollution in the Great Lakes and
Lake Champlain, between New York and Vermont.
   -Upgrade airport security and develop guidelines to warn
passengers of terrorist threats.
   -Spend $287 million for the National Community Service Act to
encourage community service and volunteerism.
   -Enact the Excellence in Mathematics, Science and Engineering
Education Act to establish a variety of fellowships, training
programs and grants to foster and improve education in those
fields. The bill authorizes $150 million for such programs in 1991.
   Bush vetoed the Indian Preference Act of 1990, which would have
established a program to direct contracts and grants to Indian
enterprises. He said the bill ``would impose new, expensive and
often duplicative program responsibilities'' on the Interior
Department, which administers Indian reservations.
   Because Congress is not in session, the president needs only to
withhold his signature from a bill to constitute a veto, a process
known as a ``pocket veto.''

<TEXT>
   The stench rising from a suburban
Chicago hog farm will soon be just a rank memory, but a neighboring
bank's claim for $250,000 in damages lingers on.
   Tenant farmer Douglas Daniels agreed in an out-of-court
settlement announced Thursday to remove his 85 pigs from the
11-acre property by Dec. 12.
   In turn, Buffalo Grove will drop complaints that the farm was a
public nuisance and an offensive and unwholesome business.
   First American Bank of Lake County in Buffalo Grove still wants
$250,000 in damages to compensate its alleged losses in new
customers and new loans during the five months Daniels raised pigs
across the street.
   Daniels' lawyer, Robert Boehm, called the damages claim
``preposterous.'' Boehm said Daniels was hospitalized with
pneumonia and unavailable for comment.
   Bank attorney Jeffrey Braiman said Friday there had been a
substantial decline in use of automated teller machines located
outside the bank. And he said the foul odor from the pig farm
detracted from employees' enjoyment of their workplace.
   ``Many times they could not even have lunch in the bank because
the smell was so overpowering,'' Braiman said. ``We think it has
injured the business and injured the reputation of the bank.''
   ``We're happy it's settled,'' said Phillip W. Versten,
administrative assistant for Buffalo Grove, a community of about
35,000 people 30 miles northwest of Chicago.
   Daniels agreed to vacate the property because the owners, Joseph
and Patricia Petrillo, found a likely buyer for the land and
because Daniels' hogs will be ready to market in early December,
Boehm said.
   First American said it would press both Daniels and the
Petrillos for damages.
   The Petrillos' lawyer, James Graney, said the bank's damages
claim was unfounded. A trial on the matter was set for Dec. 17.

   A Virginia National Guardsman was left behind
when his unit was sent to the Middle East even though he failed to
gain a court order to block his deployment to Saudi Arabia,
officials say.
   Medical tests have been ordered for Sgt. Michael R. Ange and he
will remain at Fort Lee, Va., base spokeswoman Joy Whitmore said
Friday. Ange's Army National Guard unit, the 1450th Transport
Company, was deployed to the Persian Gulf on Wednesday.
   Ange's request for a temporary restraining order was blocked by
a federal judge in Washington on Tuesday. Ange had sought to block
his deployment on grounds that President Bush lacked congressional
authority to wage war against Iraq.
   Ange, 26, a former Beaufort County, N.C., police officer, is now
a student at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C. He also
claims that he is medically unfit for military service because of
knee, leg and foot problems as well as an ulcer.
   Ange claims the Army began proceedings to discharge him because
of his medical condition long before his reserve unit was activated
last month.
   Whitmore said the decision to keep Ange at Fort Lee was in no
way a concession by the Army of its legal right to ship the soldier
to the Persian Gulf.
   Ange chalenged to the president's ability to send troops to the
Middle East without either notifying Congress under the 1973 War
Powers Act or obtaining a declaration of war as spelled out in the
Constitution.
   The resolution requires presidents to notify Congress within 48
hours of sending troops to an area where hostilities are imminent.
The troops must be withdrawn in 60 days without congressional
approval.
   Bush, who last week ordered another 200,000 U.S. troops to join
the 230,000 already in Saudi Arabia, this week told lawmakers that
he has not decided whether to use force against Iraq.
   The 1973 act was passed over the veto of President Nixon and
every chief executive since then has maintained the law is
unconstitutional. In previous cases, courts have been reluctant to
enforce the act, saying the dispute is a political matter between
the president and Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth refused to issue the
temporary restraining order but said the case raised ``a difficult
legal question'' and scheduled a Dec. 10 hearing on Ange's motion
for a permanent injunction.

   In fact, the hit television comic says she wasn't even nervous

from book sales.
   ``We've had very good income off the sales of our books,''
Carter said at Hofstra University, where a three-day seminar on his

station spokeswoman Ellen Morgenstern.
   ``This was not one of our planned segments,'' she said.
   Piscopo had a jeweler deliver the engagement ring after the

   FULTON, Mo. (AP) - Actor Bob Cummings, who for decades preached
healthy living as the key to vitality, says Parkinson's disease has
curbed his career.
   Cummings, a native of Joplin, Mo., retired from acting more than
a decade ago, but that doesn't stop producers from urging a
comeback.
   ``I read scripts, but I can't do them because of it,'' Cummings,
80, told The Fulton Sun. ``People ask me to do the scripts, but I
tell them I can't. What if I should stumble and fall down?''
   He visited Fulton for three days last week for dedication of a
sculpture carved from pieces of the Berlin Wall.
   The Sherman Oaks, Calif., resident starred in the 1942 movie
``Kings Row,'' adapted from a novel about turn-of-the-century
Fulton. Cummings was reunited with ``Kings Row'' co-star former
President Reagan, who spoke at the dedication.
   Cummings appeared in more than 100 movies and starred in his own
1950's TV show. The long-time advocate of healthy habits wrote the
book, ``How To Stay Young and Vital.''
   Parkinson's diease is a neurological ailment that can cause
tremors and severe muscle rigidity.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Threatens Federal Employee Drug-Testing Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court has struck down the
Agriculture Department's testing of workers suspected of off-duty
drug use leaving in doubt the future of a broader federal program.
   In its Friday decree, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit became the first federal appellate court to
rule on whether the government may test employees suspected of
off-duty drug use that does not affect on-the-job performance.
   In a case involving White House employees, however, the court
ruled that government officials with access to ``secret''
information may be subject to random drug testing along with
officials with ``top secret'' clearances.
   In the USDA case, the three-judge panel struck down regulations
under which employees of the agency's Food and Nutrition Service
could be tested if they were suspected of off-duty drug use even if
it did not impair job performance.
   ``Because USDA regulations authorize urinalysis testing of
ordinary employees who are not suspected of on-duty drug use or
impairment, and because those regulations mandate needlessly
intrusive testing procedures, we find them unconstitutional,'' the
court said.
   While the ruling involved one component of USDA, it has
government-wide implications because most federal agencies have
adopted similar drug testing programs, said Elaine Kaplan, an
attorney for the National Treasury Employees Union, which brought
the case.
   The ruling means that ``in order to drug test the vast majority
of federal employees, the government has to have individualized
suspicion f on-duty drug use or on-duty impairment caused by drug
use,'' Ms. Kaplan said. ``This is a significant limit on what they
were trying to do.''
   The panel, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Abner Mikva, said
``the government has not produced evidence that might establish a
relationship between off-the-job drug use and government efficiency
or on general integrity and deterrence rationales.''
   ``The government may investigate and punish wrongdoing within
the walls of its offices,'' Mikva wrote.
   ``What the government may not do in the case of ordinary
employees is justify drug testing procedures that intrude upon
constitutionally protected privacy interests with speculation about
possible future job impairment or rules violations.''
   Mikva was joined by Circuit Judges Laurence Silberman and Harry
Edwards.
   The ruling, which partially reversed a lower court opinion, also
struck down a portion of the regulations that allowed USDA
officials to monitor employees while they provide urine samples
without any suspicion that a worker might tamper with the specimen
before it was tested.
   The court called this an invasion of privacy.
   The panel upheld random testing of USDA drivers because drug use
might endanger public safety.
   In the other case, the same panel, over Edwards' dissent, upheld
a policy of randomly testing employees of the Executive Office of
the President holding ``secret'' security clearances. Courts had
previously upheld random drug tests of employees with ``top
secret'' clearances.
   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Arthur B. Spitzer said
the case means that any government employee with a ``secret''
clearance will eventually be subjected to random drug testing.
   ``Its another diminution of important constitutional rights
because of the anti-drug hysteria,'' Spitzer said.
   Edwards said that ``this case is not the first Fourth Amendment
casualty claimed by the war on drugs. Nor, in all likelihood, will
it be the last.''
   ``I fear today's decision finds us unwilling to do what we must
to preserve fundamental Fourth Amendment freedoms.''

   Thick, pasty lava once oozed onto the
surface of Venus to form 15-mile-wide domes that look like giant
pancakes or coconut macaroons in the Magellan spacecraft's newest
pictures.
   Heat measurements made by the spacecraft show fool's gold or
other iron-rich metallic minerals coat the slopes of the planet's
tallest peak, 7-mile-high Mount Maxwell.
   Scientists released new radar pictures Friday during a news
conference at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Engineers were relieved they were able to regain contact with
the spacecraft after a 40-minute blackout Thursday. It was the
third such communications failure in three months. Project manager
Tony Spear said it could happen again, but called Magellan's health
``very good.''
   Some pictures show 600-mile-long, 300-mile-wide horseshoe-shaped
features, each surrounding a meteorite impact crater 10 miles to 15
miles wide.
   The horseshoes may have been formed by shock waves triggered by
incoming meteorites or by windblown debris that settled to the
ground after being kicked up by the impacts, said geologist Ray
Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis.
   They are ``unique in the solar system,'' he said.
   The space agency also displayed a computer-processed videotape
that shows Venus' surface from the perspective of someone swooping
over 130-mile-wide, half-mile-deep volcanic collapse craters and
38,000-foot-tall Mount Maxwell, the planet's tallest mountain.
   One of the new pictures shows seven lava domes, similar but much
larger than the lava dome inside the crater of Mount St. Helens in
Washington state, said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist.
   ``They look like coconut macaroons. They look like pancakes,''
he said. ``They're about 2,500 feet high and 15 miles across.''
   Magellan's heat measurements show some of the middle slopes of
Mount Maxwell contain ``mystery material'' that emits little heat,
said Gordon Pettengill of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   That means the slopes are coated with soil containing metallic
material, either iron pyrite - called fool's gold because it looks
like gold - or iron minerals called hematite and magnetite,
Pettengill said.
   Radar pictures show numerous mountain ridges and valleys created
by squeezing of Venus' hot, thin crust, said Sean Solomon of MIT.
In places, the mountains are no longer being squeezed upward, and
are collapsing down onto lowland plains, he added.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, arrived at Venus on Aug. 10 and formally started mapping the
planet Sept. 15.
   Magellan has used radar to peer through clouds and map 18
percent of Venus' landscape, comparable to an area on Earth
stretching from Los Angeles to Reykjavik, Iceland, and covering
most of North and South America.
   Thursday's loss of contact with Magellan halted mapping for most
of the day. Engineers still don't know the exact cause but suspect
excess static sometimes disrupts one of Magellan's computers, Spear
said.
   Those malfunctions and other problems will add about $3 million
to $5 million to the $744 million cost of Magellan's mission, Spear
said.

   Atlantis astronauts on a secret
mission have deployed a surveillance satellite, possibly to spy on
Iraq.
   A news blackout ordered by the Pentagon prevented NASA from
discussing the flight, but sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said the spy satellite was released Friday.
   Published reports have said the spacecraft will either eavesdrop
on communications or conduct photo surveys of the Persian Gulf,
where Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August and the United States
promptly sent troops.
   The Air Force reportedly modified the satellite to spy on the
Persian Gulf region while Atlantis was grounded this summer because
of hydrogen leaks.
   But NASA remained mum about the mission, breaking the public
silence just briefly Friday to announce the five astronauts would
land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., sometime between 5 p.m. and
8 p.m. EST Monday. A more precise time will be announced 24 hours
before landing.
   ``The crew is doing well, and the orbiter Atlantis continues to
perform satisfactorily,'' said Mission Control commentator Kari
Fluegel.
   Atlantis, with an all-military crew commanded by Air Force Col.
Richard Covey, blasted into orbit Thursday night.
   The mission is the second shuttle flight in two months.
Discovery flew last month when a nuclear-powered probe was
dispatched on a journey to explore the sun's poles.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to
fly nine missions this year, but several flights have been delayed
because of hydrogen leaks detected aboard Atlantis and Columbia.
They were cleared for flight last month.
   Columbia's long-delayed astronomy mission now is scheduled to
launch in early December. If successful, it would be the sixth
shuttle flight this year.

<HEAD>Worldwide Weapons Spending Declines For First Time In A Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending on weapons by the nations of the
world, including the Soviet Union, has decreased for the first time
in 10 years, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency reports.
   The agency said Friday that developing nations accounted for
most of the decline, spending $25.1 billion less in 1988 than the
year before. The overall drop was $36 billion.
   Even so, spending on arms surpassed $1 trillion for the second
year in a row.
   Military spending in developing countries has been dropping
since 1984. The $11 billion decline among the wealthier nations is
the first drop in a decade.
   The Soviet Union, meanwhile, spent $299.8 billion on arms in
1988, a drop of 4 percent. The United States led the world with
$307.7 billion, showing a slight increase over 1987.
   The Soviets are still in first place, however, in exporting
weapons - $21 billion worth or 44 percent of the world's total in
1988. U.S. arms exports were $14.3 billion, the agency said.
   The end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988 contributed to a drop in
military spending in the Middle East. At $60.7 billion it was at
the lowest level in a decade.
   South Asian military spending continued to grow faster than any
other region of the world - with an annual rate from 1978 to 1988
of 6.5 percent.
   The figures were all given in terms of dollars of 1988 buying
power.

<HEAD>VA Cuts Rate Ceiling To 9.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs is dropping
the maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home mortgages by
one-half percentage point to 9.5 percent, effective Monday.
   ``This should provide a significant stimulus to the housing
market and the economy as a whole,'' Secretary Edward J. Derwinski
said Friday.
   The new rate is for home and condominium loans. It means the
monthly payment for principal and interest on a typical VA loan of
$80,000 will total $672.29, down $29.37 a month from the previous
rate.
   The department increased the rate from 9.5 percent to 10 percent
last February.
   The department also lowered the rates for manufactured homes to
12 percent; graduated payment mortgages, to 9.7 percent;
manufactured home and lot combination loans, to 11.5 percent;
manufactured home lots only, 11.5 percent, and home improvement
loans, to 11 percent.
   It said that in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, it guaranteed
196,600 home loans totaling $15.8 billion, compared to 188,000 home
loans totaling $14.4 billion in the previous year.
   VA home loan guarantees may be used to purchase, improve or
refinance a house or condominium and to purchase or refinance a
manufactured home.

<HEAD>CIA Employees Reported Fired In Stamp Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Central Intelligence Agency employees
have been fired in an investigation of the sale of valuable
mistakenly printed postage stamps, the agency said.
   The CIA said Friday night that five other employees were
disciplined in unspecified ways.
   The case arose when the CIA purchased 95 of the $1 stamps at the
McLean, Va., post office for its own use in 1986.
   The stamps showed an oil lamp, but the ones bought by the CIA
had the body of the lamp upside down. Such misprints can be
extremely valuable to stamp collectors.
   The nine employees sold 85 of the misprints to a New Jersey
dealer, giving the dealer one torn stamp. Each employee kept one
stamp, now worth a reported $17,000 each, and one of the nine
employees is believed to have lost his stamp.
   The four employees who were dismissed were fired for lying to
investigators, misappropriating government property and ``failing
to return a number of valuable stamps purchased with agency funds
after they were directed to do so,'' said spokesman Mark Mansfield.
   The dismissals were ordered ``reluctantly, only after all
alternatives were fully explored, and this resolves the case from
our point of view,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Charged In Capitol Bombing Given 10-Year Prison Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who pleaded guilty to charges she
helped bomb the U.S. Capitol seven years ago has been handed a
10-year federal prison term.
   Marilyn Buck, 42, also was ordered Friday to serve a concurrent
five-year prison term for conspiracy in the Nov. 7, 1983 incident.
   The sentences, ordered by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene,
will run concurrently with a 60-year sentence Buck is serving on
other charges, prosecutors said.
   The U.S. attorney's office said repairs to the Capitol and art
work displayed there cost $250,000.
   Buck pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to charges she was involved in the
bombing and in plans to bomb other federal buildings. The remaining
co-defendants in the case, Linda Evans, 43, and Laura Whitehorn,
43, also pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.
   A group calling itself the Armed Resistance Unit claimed
responsibility for the Capitol bombing, saying it was done in
response to U.S. military action in Grenada.
   The bomb was placed in a public corridor near the Senate
Republican Cloak Room and a few feet from the offices of Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then the majority leader. It was
detonated with a time-delay device.
   Prosecutors said an investigation revealed members of the group
also were involved in seven other bombings from 1983 to 1985 in the
Washington and New York areas.
   Authorities said Buck participated in a 1981 Brinks armored
truck robbery in Nyack, N.Y., in which four people were killed.

<HEAD>Government Agrees to Help Locate Absent Fathers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has agreed to help children
fathered and left overseas by American soldiers to make contact
with their long-departed parents.
   The National Archives and a British group, War Babes, on Friday
released details of a draft settlement of a 2-year-old lawsuit
intended to force the Archives and Defense Department to help
children separated from, and sometimes unknown to, the fathers.
   The agreement was signed for the government Thursday and filed
in federal court by Jay B. Stevens, U.S. attorney for the District
of Columbia and Joan S. Meier, Washington-based lawyer for War
Babes, a Birmingham, England-based organization of 300 sons and
daughters of American fathers.
   Final court approval is expected. The breakthrough in the case
came when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in July ordered the
Pentagon in its defense to produce affidavits from fathers
declining contact from their offspring, Ms. Meier said.
   The settlement ``begins to redress the wrongs that started
during the (World War II) when the Army encouraged men to have a
good time, and then prevented them from marrying the mothers of
their children and whisked them away so they could not be found,''
Ms. Meier said.
   She added that the settlement will help all children of American
veterans who want to know their fathers, including those from the
Korean and Vietnam wars.
   War Babes sought to establish that the right of children to
information under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act took priority
over the Privacy Act.
   The Pentagon has cited the Privacy Act to refuse requests to
help reach veterans or active members of the armed forces even
where the names and service numbers were provided.
   Calling the settlement ``a significant victory for families the
world over,'' War Babes said the Pentagon had maintained that
``fatherhood of an illegitimate child during youth is at worst
embarrassing and at a minimum highly personal. Contact by ... a
long-lost illegitimate child, is clearly intrusive, whether welcome
or not.''
   Shirley McGlade, the founder of War Babes, said in an affidavit
filed in the case that several fathers have been traced, and
contrary to the U.S. government position, ``in almost every case
the father welcomed his child, often with great joy.''
   The government agreed in the settlement to forward certified
mail from a son or daughter to the father at the last address
listed in the National Personnel Records Center, operated by the
Archives under Pentagon direction.
   If the father has died, the government agreed to disclose the
address in returning the letter. In other cases, the city and state
but not the street address will be provided, Ms. Meier said.
   Ms. McGlade was the daughter of a Welsh woman and an American
soldier who left not knowing her mother was pregnant, she said. She
found her father in California with the help of a U.S. radio
program and his friends.
   Attorney Meier said thousands of sons and daughters in England
alone could be affected by the settlement. Not all cases involve
illegitimate births, she said, mentioning the sudden separations
that occur during a war.

<HEAD>Sarawak Natives Protest Logging of Tropical Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of native groups in Borneo island's Sarawak
region - the world's largest producer of tropical wood - say they
are suffering from hunger and water pollution because of excessive
logging.
   Friends of the Earth, an environmental group representing the
natives, said Friday that nearly half the region's trees have been
cut down. A study says the rest could disappear in seven years in
Sarawak, a Malaysian state on nrthern Borneo.
   The native groups, in Tokyo for a meeting of the International
Tropical Timber Organization, on Friday criticized Japan and
tropical wood importers for violating their traditional rights over
vast areas of forest in the Malaysian state.
   ``We are short of food. We hardly find anything from the jungle
as we used to. But the ITTO pays no attention,'' said Jok Jau
Evong, head of a Kayan residents association in Uma Bawang in
eastern Sarawak, told reporters.
   ``In the past, it was still easy to live off the land. Since the
timber companies came ... the fruits, edible plants and shoots were
all damaged. Water pollution has killed the fish,'' said Juwin
Lehan, who heads a Penan group in the area.
   ``The loss of the forest has caused massive erosion and
sedimentation of rivers and creeks leading to flash floods. The
water is contaminated and there are increasing reports of diarrhea
and cholera,'' said Aster Soong of Friends of the Earth Malaysia.
   An official of the International Tropical Timber Organization,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the issue would be
discussed Monday in a forum at ITTO headquarters in Yokohama, near
Tokyo.
   Sarawak has a population of 1.3 million people and a land area
of 49,000 square miles, about the size of New York state.
   Restrictions on timber exports from neighboring countries like
Thailand and Indonesia have accelerated cutting in Sarawak in the
past three years, making it the world's largest producer of
tropical wood.
   Last year, Sarawak produced 543 million cubic feet of logs, up
from 455 million cubic feet in 1988. Over half of Sarawak's wood
exports are imported by Japan.
   Friends of the Earth, an environmental group representing the
natives, says that only 60,600 square miles of Malaysia's original
117,700 square miles of forest land still have trees.
   At the current rate of logging, about 2,700 square miles a year,
the nation's primary forest will be depleted in seven or eight
years, according to a report by the University of Malaysia's botany
department.
   Increased cutting has put loggers and natives, some of whom
still live as nomads in the forest, in direct confrontation with
each other.
   Native groups have attempted to prevent logging by setting up
blockades and making appeals to government leaders, so far with
little success, Jok Jau Evong said.
   ``We are the people who have been there for many generations.
Somebody who just came yesterday is trying to get all the resources
and we have no rights,'' he said.
   A recent ITTO mission to investigate conditions in Sarawak said
that log production must be reduced by 30 percent, or 105 million
cubic feet a year, to prevent depletion of the forests. It also
recommended that forest management be improved.
   But Friends of the Earth and the native groups accused the
mission of not thoroughly investigating the environmental impact of
logging and said the recommendation would not save the forests.
   They are demanding a moratorium on all logging until policies
are changed to prevent further damage to watershed areas and to
protect the rights of people living in the forests.

<HEAD>South Korean President To Make First Visit Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo has
accepted a Soviet invitation to visit Moscow before the end of the
year, a presidential spokesman said today.
   It would be the first trip to the Soviet Union by a president of
South Korea, a fierce rival of Communist North Korea since the
division of the peninsula in 1945.
   Moscow and Seoul have recently been improving ties, establishing
formal diplomatic relations Oct. 30.
   Chief presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said the trip
invitation wasincluded in a letter from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to Roh, which was delivered by a visiting Soviet
official.
   Vadim Medvedyev, a member of the Soviet Presidential Council,
arrived Friday and said he was carrying a letter from Gorbachev to
Roh. He met with the South Korean president this afternoon.
   Roh accepted the invitation, the spokesman said. The date of his
Soviet visit will be decided later through diplomatic channels, he
said.
   ``President Roh's visit to the Soviet Union will not only
develop relations of the two countries but also provide a good
opportunity to promote stability and peace on Northeast Asia,'' the
spokesman said.
   Local newspapers, quoting unidentified high-ranking government
officials, reported Roh's trip would take place around Dec. 18. The
influential Chosun Ilbo newspaper said the Korean president's visit
will last five days.
   It would be the second time that Gorbachev and Roh have met in
less than six months. The two leaders met in San Francisco on June
4.
   Gorbachev is expected to return the visit before or after his
scheduled trip to Japan next spring, Chosun said.
   Roh's trip would be a further setback for North Korea, which is
allied with the Soviet Union. The two Koreas fought a bloody
three-year war in the early 1950s.

   Julie Setty is a card shark. A
Christmas card shark, that is.
   The 16-year-old Simi Valley High School student has written more
than 4,000 cards since July for mailing to U.S. soldiers around the
world.
   Scribbling at a rate of 40 cards per hour, she plans to dash off
a couple hundred more holiday messages before sending the whole
batch on Tuesday.
   The idea is ``to let everyone out in the military ... know we're
behind them 100 percent,'' said Miss Setty, who spent $350 on the
cards.
   She and the 67 other members of her Air Force Junior ROTC
program at the suburban Los Angeles high school hope to get about
9,000 cards to members of the military by Christmas.
   The greetings will be shipped by Military Mail Call, a nonprofit
organization that distributes holiday greetings each year to troops
in the United States and abroad.
   Although Miss Setty's card output is remarkably high, she's not
the only person who enjoys sending Christmas cards.
   Her classmate Ben Schelb has completed 3,200 cards this year,
and her brother, Jeff, sent 2,225 cards to U.S. servicemen last
year.

<HEAD>Scholarly Politics: Dispute Over New Editor for Ancient
Manuscripts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AMY WESTFELDT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   International scholars deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls have
chosen a new chief editor, hoping to speed up work on the ancient
manuscripts. The incumbent called the move a power play by academic
rivals.
   The scholars appointed Emmanuel Tov to share duties with editor
in chief John Strugnell and complete work still unfinished about
four decades after the documents' discovery.
   ``Once you get to a point where a whole generation who has
looked forward to getting published are getting older and dying,
the level of frustration gets higher,'' said Eugene Ulrich,
theology professor at University of Notre Dame.
   The Dead Sea Scrolls, first discovered in 1947 in a cave in
present-day Israel, are considered one of the richest religious
libraries ever discovered from the period that gave birth to
Christianity and modern Judaism.
   They date from about 100 B.C. to A.D. 70 and contain the oldest
known copies of the Old and New Testaments, other Biblical
writings, literature and poetry.
   Scholars editing the scrolls voted by mail in October to appoint
Tov, of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, to share duties with
Strugnell, of Harvard Divinity School, said Frank Cross of Harvard
University, another member of the editing team.
   The Israeli Department of Antiquities, which proposed Tov, is
making an ``alarming attempt'' to wrest publishing rights from
current researchers, Strugnell said in a telephone interview
Thursday. He wouldn't offer specifics but said he will fight Tov's
appointment.
   Tov's appointment has not been announced, but Strugnell said the
Israeli agency mailed notices to scholars earlier this month. It
was expected to be formally announced to about 5,000 theologians
and archaeologists at the American Schools of Oriental Research
convention in New Orleans this weekend.
   Cross called Strugnell ineffective. ``There has been general
criticism, both inside the team and out. It is not by chance that
this move is being made,'' he said.
   The incumbent defended his program as being on schedule and said
rivals are trying to grab power from him.
   Strugnell said he would agree to appoint a deputy editor in
chief but not a co-editor. ``I don't see how it can be shared,'' he
said.
   The shakeup is the latest in a years of academic dispute over
who should control publishing rights to the scrolls.
   The first fragile documents were discovered by a Bedouin
shepherd in a cave near the Dead Sea. Many manuscripts, which
contained mainly Old Testament books, were published immediately.
   Many other documents unearthed uring the next 10 years in 11
caves remain largely undeciphered and unpublished. Strugnell said
the remaining documents - as much as 45 percent of the total
discovery - should be published by the year 2000.
   The manuscripts, particularly those discovered in 1952 in the
fourth cave at Qumran, were found in fragments ranging from the
size of a dime to the size of a human hand.
   Eight scholars, headed by Strugnell and overseen by the Israeli
department, were given exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls,
which remain sealed in aluminum boxes in the Rockefeller Museum in
Jerusalem. The team was expanded in the mid-1980s, but still
numbers fewer than 15.
   Ulrich, in a recent telephone interview, said Strugnell has not
inspired others to work faster.
   ``You can certainly say that one would expect one volume to have
appeared (from Strugnell) in the course of this time,'' Ulrich
said.
   Strugnell blamed the slow pace on the painstaking task of
piecing together the fragments, which can only be read under
infrared photography, and a lack of ample funding.
   Other scholars like James VanderKam of North Carolina State
University have offered unpublished photographs of the documents to
other professors. VanderKam said that has helped quiet some
criticism.
   ``People just seem to have lost their initial zeal,'' VanderKam
said. ``That's why it's a good idea to pass it on to others.''

   Bret Easton Ellis' graphically violent novel
about a serial killer has been purchased by Vintage Books after
being dropped at the last minute by Simon &amp; Schuster, it was
reported today.
   Vintage, a division of Random House, will publish the book
``American Psycho'' as a trade paperback early next year, The New
York Times reported.
   Simon &amp; Schuster had planned to publish the book in hard cover
in January, but rejected it as being in ``questionable taste,''
said the publisher's chairman, Richard E. Snyder. The book contains
graphic descriptions of women being dismembered and cannibalized.
   The publisher paid Ellis a $300,000 advance, which he said he
will keep. Vintage didn't disclose its purchase price.
   Ellis, 26, praised Vintage's decision to publish the book as a
trade - or higher-priced - paperback, saying that will get it into
stores quickly.
   Simon &amp; Schuster, which had published Ellis' previous novels
``Less Than Zero'' and ``The Rules of Attraction,'' announced
Wednesday it was dropping ``American Psycho.''
   The author accused the publisher of censorship and of bowing to
pressure from its parent company, Paramount Communications Inc.
   Snyder said he decided to scrap the book after reading it last
weekend.
   ``I just decided it was an error in judgment to put our name on
a book of such questionable taste,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump christened the lavish Taj Mahal
casino less than a year ago as the showpiece of his big-bucks
empire. Now it's headed for bankruptcy-court protection.
   Trump and his Taj Mahal bondholders agreed Friday to a debt
restructuring that will temporarily place the plush Atlantic City,
N.J., gambling palace under bankruptcy-court protection and give
the investors half ownership.
   The deal was reached more than 12 hours after Trump missed a
$47.3 million interest payment on $675 million in junk bonds used
to finance the casino.
   Some details of the agreement were still to be worked out, but
bondholder representatives said it contained several incentives for
Trump to improve the performance of the Taj Mahal.
   ``It's very much a carrot and stick approach here that we've
adopted,'' said Robert Miller, an attorney for the bondholders.
   Trump, at a news conference with his aides and representatives
of the bondholders group, said: ``The result is turning out to be a
very positive one.''
   Still, the flamboyant developer who once prided himself as a
masterful businessman with enormous wealth looked grim during the
news conference, held in another one of his swank properties, the
Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. He didn't shake hands with any bondholder
representatives.
   The arrangement was the latest reversal for Trump, whose
reputation as a jet-setting financial genius was shattered as New
York's economy soured and he slid into multibillion-dollar debt.
   The Taj Mahal's bondholders had threatened to push Trump into
bankruptcy proceedings and seize control of the casino.
   Under Friday's compromise, Trump and his investors agreed to
restructure the debt in what is known as a ``prepackaged''
bankruptcy filing that will let the casino emerge from court
protection within weeks, negotiators said.
   The interest rate on the bonds will be reduced to 12 percent
from the current 14 percent and bondholders initially will receive
50 percent of the stock in the casino.
   Of the 12 percent interest, 10 percent must be paid in cash and
2 percent in bonds. But if Trump is able to pay the original 14
percent interest, his stake in the Taj Mahal will increase to 80
percent. The maturity date on the bonds will be extended from 1998
to 2000.
   The deal also requires that the Taj Mahal operate within 15
percent of its budget or Trump must turn control of it over to the
bondholders.
   The cash-strapped Trump billed the 3-acre gaming hall the
``Eighth Wonder of the World'' when he opened it April 2, but it
has been unable to take in the $1.3 million a day that industry
analysts say is required for it to break even.
   The $1 billion resort, more than twice as large as any other
Atlantic City casino, opened during an economic downturn that has
placed financial pressure on several of New Jersey's casinos.
   Trump owns three casinos there - the Taj Mahal, Trump Castle and
Trump Plaza - and all have high-yield junk bonds outstanding. The
problems at the casinos as well as the depressed New York real
estate market left Trump strapped for cash and helped bring on his
current financial woes.
   The developer, who now owes an estimated $2 billion to banks,
has been negotiating with his creditors since last spring to keep
from losing his many properties.

said the publisher's chairman, Richard E. Snyder. The book contains
graphic descriptions of women being dismembered and cannibalized.
   The publisher paid Ellis a $300,000 advance, which he said he
will keep. Vintage didn't disclose its purchase price.
   Ellis, 26, praised Vintage's decision to publish the book as a
trade - or higher-priced - paperback, saying that will get it into
stores quickly.
   Simon &amp; Schuster, which had published Ellis' previous novels
``Less Than Zero'' and ``The Rules of Attraction,'' announced
Wednesday it was dropping ``American Psycho.''
   The author accused the publisher of censorship and of bowing to
pressure from its parent company, Paramount Communications Inc.
   Snyder said he decided to scrap the book after reading it last
weekend.
   ``I just decided it was an error in judgment to put our name on
a book of such questionable taste,'' he said.

<HEAD>Backers of Former Contras May Plot New Strategy in Nicaraguan
Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of former Contras who have
occupied buildings and blockaded roads to pressure the government
will plot new strategy if talks produce no results this weekend, a
spokesman says.
   Mayor Armando Incer of Boaco, one of 18 southeastern towns
supporting the ex-rebels' protests, said Friday his movement wants
``no government militarism and material aid for the disbanded
Nicaraguan Resistance, so it can integrate into civilian life.''
   Goverment commissions and mayors continued negotiations Friday
to end the occupations and blockades along the Rama road, the only
route between the capital Managua and the Atlantic Coast.
   Incer said that without progress in talks, his movement will
meet Sunday to consider new measures. He did not elaborate.
   Police fired tear gas to break up a blockade by about 60
protestors Friday at the road's midpoint of Juigalpa, 90 miles east
of Managua.
   The disbanded Contras and their supporters have been blocking
the area all month to demand that President Violeta Chamorro live
up to promises of aid to the former guerrillas she made when they
agreed to disarm.
   The Contras had fought a U.S.-backed, 9-year war against Mrs.
Chamorro's predecessors, the former Sandinista administration.
   Her insistence on allowing Sandinista leaders to maintain
control of the army and police has become a central complaint in
the blockades.
   ``The dismissal of the ministers of Interior and Presidency and
the head of the army'' were at the top of a 12-point list of
negotiation demands spokesmen for the dissident mayors presented in
a news conference Friday.
   Also on Friday, lawmakers gave a vote of confidence to Mrs.
Chamorro's attempts to handle the rash of disturbances without
violence.
   ``In strengthening law and order, the use of the mechanism of
dialogue and consensus reaches adequate solutions to political and
social conflict,'' said a statement approved by 70 deputies with
three abstentions. The remaining members of 92-seat assembly were
absent during the vote.
   ``We condemn violence wherever it comes from and support the
search for peaceful solutions,'' the lawmakers said.
   The army has been called out one time during the series of
conflicts that has claimed at least 24 lives and left dozens
wounded.
   Troops were deployed Wednesday to end a blockade at Sebaco, 50
miles north of Managua, after four police were killed and 23 other
people were injured in a shootout.
   Mrs. Chamorro has warned, however, that she will call out the
army if unrest continues.

<HEAD>Report: Iraq Believed To Have Superguns</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq may have three superguns designed to fire
114-pound shells up to 465 miles and hit several neighboring
capitals, but it's not known if the guns are operational, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Independent, citing unidentified U.S. intelligence sources,
reported the guns were made from parts manufactured by British
companies and delivered to Iraq before the Iraqi project was
uncovered by British customs officers last April.
   There was no immediate reaction from officials in Iraq, Britain
or the United States. Cities such as Jerusalem, Tehran, Iran, and
the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh are within 465 miles of Iraq.
   On April 12, British customs officers seized eight large
sections of steel tubing at Teesport dock in northeast England. The
tubes were about to be shipped to Iraq.
   The Iraqi government and the manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters of Rotherham in northern England, said the tubes were
for an Iraqi petrochemical plant.
   Military experts at the time said the tubes appeared to be part
of a barrel for a huge gun.
   But The Independent reported further customs investigations
revealed the tubes were ``part of a ballistic test bed'' for a plan
to fire satellites into space.
   It said the satellite plan was named Project Babylon and that
the supergun Project 839 grew out of it.
   Also in April, Turkish customs officers seized a 30-ton steel
cylinder from a truck heading for Iraq. British customs officers
said they thought this was also due to form part of an Iraqi gun.
Other suspected parts were seized in Greece and Italy.
   On Thursday, charges against two men accused of breaching
Britain's arms embargo against Iraq were dropped at Sheffield
Magistrates Court. Both denied any knowledge of the alleged gun.
   A lawyer for the Department of Customs and Excise told the court
there was not enough evidence to bring a successful prosecution
against businessman Peter Mitchell. The agency also did not wish to
proceed against metallurgist Christopher Cowley.
   Mitchell, 43, had been charged with illegally exporting
equipment. He is managing director of forgemasters Walter Somers
Ltd., manufacturers of the pipe found in Turkey.
   Cowley, 52, faced two similar charges of organizing illegal
exports. Press Association, the British domestic news agency,
reported that Cowley is a former project coordinator for
Canadian-born U.S. artillery expert Gerald Bull.
   Bull, slain by a gunman in Brussels, Belgium, on March 22, was
reportedly hired by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to design a
supergun.
   The Independent reported that Belgian police and justice sources
believe the killing was linked to agents of Mossad, the Israeli
security service.
   It said Walter Somers and Sheffield Forgemasters built three
satellite guns for Project Babylon. It said the design work was
completed by Cowley, who worked for Bull's Belgium-based Space
Research Corp.
   It added: ``Project 839 was the work of an SRC company, and it
borrowed heavily on the research conducted over the years by Dr.
Bull. Most important, 839 was a gun in every sense.''

<HEAD>Union Marchers Rally, Newspaper Drivers Arrested After Firecracker
Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chanting ``Scabs go home,'' 2,000 demonstraters
shut down traffic in midtown Manhattan with a march in support of
striking Daily News workers.
   Striking Greyhound workers, members of city unions and others
marched for nearly a mile Friday. They then held a rally outside
the Daily News offices, where Newspaper Guild local president Barry
Lipton directed a message to replacement workers hired after the
strike.
   ``Get the hell out of town. We want our jobs back, and we'll get
our jobs back,'' Lipton said.
   Earlier Friday, two striking Daily News drivers and a former
driver were arrested after allegedly setting off two powerful M-80
firecrackers at a Long Island convenience store that sells the
tabloid.
   Officials from the News and the unions condemned the violence.
   A customer was slightly injured when the firecracker dipped in
wax and rolled in BBs exploded at a 7-Eleven store, Nassau County
police said.
   Charles Esposito, 47, a striking driver, and Russell Kengott,
23, a former driver, were charged with arson, possession of a
weapon, criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, assault and
conspiracy, said Detective Sgt. Daniel Sheehan.
   Luke Fox, 31, a striking driver, was charged with the same
offenses and an additional weapons possession count, police said.
   Sheehan said the men bought beer in the store and left one
firecracker by the front door and another by a refrigerator.
   The explosions shattered glass and sprayed the store with BBs. A
customer was struck in the arm and buttocks, but refused medical
attention, police said.
   Violence has punctuated the strike since it began on Oct. 25.
New York City police report that as of Thursday, there have been
173 strike-related incidents and 80 arrests.
   Many vendors, saying they have been intimidated, are refusing to
sell the News, which before the strike was the nation's
third-largest metropolitan daily newspaper.
   In Nassau County, where the News has a printing plant in Garden
City, there have been 28 criminal incidents, 14 arrests and five
injuries, police said.
   Three of those who participated in Friday's march were charged
with disorderly conduct, harassment, obstructing governmental
administration and resisting arrest, said police spokesman Officer
Scott Bloch. A fourth man was charged with disorderly conduct.
   The Daily News, using management, replacement workers and
returning Newspaper Guild members, has published every day since
the strike began.
   But circulation has lagged. The News said last week that it was
printing 600,000 papers a day and selling about 400,000, down from
1.09 million before the strike. It said 2,000 of its usual 12,000
outlets were selling the paper.
   The News has hired hawkers, including homeless and other
unemployed people, in an attempt to fill the void.

<HEAD>Milli Vanilli Says Record Company Knew They Were Fakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What did Arista executives know about Milli
Vanilli's fake singing and when did they know it?
   Group members and a former manager claimed record company
executives at Arista knew the dreadlocked duo was faking it, even
before the Grammy Awards ceremony in February.
   German producer Frank Farian this week confirmed longstanding
rumors the pair, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, did not sing on
the multi-platinum ``Girl You Know It's True'' album. Farian said
the two lip-synced for videos and live appearances.
   But Pilatus told the Los Angeles Times on Friday the pair had
already admitted the truth to Clive Davis, president of Arista.
   ``We told Clive Davis. We told Sandy Gallin (a Hollywood talent
manager). We told everybody six months before the Grammy Awards,''
Pilatus said.
   Milli Vanilli's former manager, Todd Headlee, said their phony
recording was common knowledge at the record company.
   ``Everyone at Arista who worked closely with the group was
walking on eggshells before the Grammy lip-sync performance last
February,'' Headlee told the Times.
   ``When they walked off the stage clutching the trophy, I
remember thinking to myself that they may not have deserved the
Grammy for their performance, but they sure as hell did deserve an
Oscar,'' Headlee added.
   Roy Lott, executive vice president of Arista, denied the
entertainers' account.
   ``There is now way that anyone ever could have know whether they
sang or not,'' Lott said. ``We are merely a distributor of their
records. Rob and Fab and Frank assured us that they sang on the
record.''
   A call seeking comment from Davis on Friday night was not
returned.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences will decide
next month whether to strip the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.
   ``It was fraud and we're appalled by it,'' NARAS President
Michael Greene said Friday. ``But our hearts go out to these two
guys, because they're very easy targets.''
   The NARAS awards subcommittee will meet Dec. 5 in New York to
discuss revoking the award and the board of trustees will meet
later that month to make a final decision. If the Grammy is revoked
it would mark the first such action taken in the academy's 33-year
history.
   Casey Kasem, host of the national radio program, Casey's Top 40,
said today Milli Vanilli should be ``forgiven.''
   ``In all fairness you have to recognize that we all, at one time
or another, have been sucked into a situation we regret,'' Kasem
said from Washington D.C. in a telephone interview with the
Associated Press.
   ``The album was a major seller and loved by a lot of people,''
Kasem said. ``They (Milli Vanilli) know in their hearts they could
have done that but didn't have the opportunity.''
   Meanwhile, angry fans turned in their ``Milli Vanilli''
recordings Friday and radio stations vowed to pull the pop duo off
the air.
   ``I think they're dirty scumbuckets,'' said 9-year-old Katie
Dickman of Richmond, Ind. ``I used to like them, but not now.''
   Radio station WLOL-FM in Minneapolis said it was ``Milli Vanilli
Free'' and would no longer play the album.
   Farian says he was forced to go public with the revelations when
the boys told him they wanted to sing on the follow-up record.
   ``I said, `No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice,
but that's not really what I want to use on my records,'' Farian
said Wednesday.
   In a statement Thursday, the two said they ``have been ready,
willing and able to record our own vocals and have been prevented
by Frank Farian from doing so.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Mass for Slain Jesuits Demands Support of
Underprivileged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 people, including
150 priests, attended a Mass marking a year since the massacre of
six Jesuit priests - a case in which army officers were arrested
but have yet to go to trial.
   The Central American head of the Jesuit order said at the
outdoor Mass on Friday that worldwide attention to the massacre
should be forged into support for the underprivileged in the Third
World.
   ``The developed world's solidarity will not be authentic as long
as it is limited to supporting us, the Jesuits, ... while
alienation, poverty and injustice continue to batter the
disenfranchised,'' said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, provincial for
the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus.
   Six priest-educators, their housekeeper and her daughter were
slain on Nov. 16, 1989. An army colonel, three lieutenants and four
soldiers are under arrest and charged with the murders, but the
case has not yet gone to trial.
   No officer has ever been convicted of killing civilians in the
11-year Salvadoran civil war, that has claimed more than 73,000
lives, mostly civilian.
   The army lost half of its $85 million in U.S. military aid
planned for 1991, because Congress was unhappy with El Salvador's
progress in prosecuting the Jesuit murder case.
   El Salvador's far right considered the Jesuits subversives for
their contention that the guerrilla war against a series of
U.S.-backed governments stems from injustice, repression and
poverty - rather than international Communist expansion.
   Seventeen bishops, including four U.S. prelates, co-celebrated
the Mass in a parking lot at the University of Central America,
where the slain priests taught.
   Portraits of the martyrs hung from a wire stretched above the
altar - the Revs. Ignacio Ellacuria, Ignacio Martin-Baro, Segundo
Montes, Amado Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez.
   The U.S. bishops who took part in Friday's ceremony were the
Revs. Walter Sullivan of Richmond, Va.; Carlos Sevilla of San
Francisco; Ricardo Ramirez of Las Cruces, N.M.; and Rembert
Weakland of Milwaukee.
   The ceremony took place against a backdrop of fighting between
the army and the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Twenty-six army members died and at least 22 were injured
Thursday and Friday in a battle with rebels 61 miles southeast of
San Salvador near San Agustin, according to the rebel Radio
Farabundo Marti.
   The army said Friday it did not have a casualty count because
the fighting was still going on.

   It'll be the big house instead of the
penthouse for a college dropout who lived the good life on bad
checks and unpaid credit cards.
   Anthony DeFelippis, 21, was ordered to spend 37 months in
federal prison as punishment for a cross-country spending spree of
more than $100,000. He was convicted on felonies for bank larceny
and making false statements to a bank.
   ``I think the only explanation would be the statement `out of
control,''' DeFelippis said during his sentencing hearing.
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm cited DeFelippis' unrepentant
attitude in levying the lengthy sentence. DeFelippis blamed his
problems on his failure to attain a college degree and didn't
express remorse for his crimes during his hearing Thursday.
   The convictions resulted from a series of bad checks, overdrawn
credit cards and misrepresentations made to bankers in the two
years since DeFilippis, a New Jersey native, quit Bradley
University in 1988.
   After dropping out of school, his only employment then was a
part-time job in New Jersey that paid him $4,000 over four months.
   But records show he fancied silk suits, traveled in limousines,
took a joy ride in a helicopter and charged the rental fee to the
Chicago brokerage company where he hoped to work.
   He succeeded in running up a $100,000 tab on his American
Express credit card and accruing large debts on other credit cards,
according to court testimony. Authorities said he left a string of
creditors in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Florida.
   DeFelippis was arrested in Chicago in March 1989 on a federal
warrant resulting from his application for a $250,000 loan at a
Peoria bank. On his application, he fraudulently claimed to have a
$2 million annual income, prosecutors said.
   FBI agents began tracking him when he returned to the bank to
check on his loan application's status. He caught a plane to
Chicago and was picked up by Chicago Police while trying to make a
large credit purchase at Neiman Marcus, records indicate.
   He has been held without bond since July 1989. He pleaded guilty
to the charges in April.

<TEXT>
   On the 700-mile trek to freedom across the
desert from occupied Kuwait, Ernest Briskey knew the consequences
if he was captured.
   For him, it would have meant life in prison, he said. For those
who were hiding him, it would mean death.
   Disguised as an Arab, the 59-year-old Oregon State University
official successfully made the seven-day journey from Kuwait City
to Amman, Jordan.
   ``I now appreciate what life is all about,'' he said.
   Sporting a beard he grew as part of his disguise, Briskey smiled
through tears as he was greeted by his family at Portland
International Airport Friday.
   He wouldn't talk about the details of his escape because he
feared for the safety of those who helped him. Asked if he was
concerned that he would be caught, he joked, ``if I'd have sneezed,
maybe.''
   ``There were about 100 points, perhaps, between Kuwait City and
crossing the border where one has to be especially sensitive,'' he
said. ``There were a lot of soldiers.''
   Briskey, assistant vice president for international program
development at Oregon State, spent 110 days in hiding. Many of the
Americans he knew were taken hostage. Others were able to return
home. Some still are in hiding, he said.
   A food technology expert and former dean of agriculture at
Oregon State, Briskey was working as a senior adviser to the
Kuwaiti Institute of Scientific Research when Iraqi forces invaded
the country on Aug. 2.
   ``It's been an incredibly brutal destruction of a people and a
country,'' he said, ``actually much worse than what has been
portrayed perhaps to the American people.''
   Briskey said everything of value that could be removed has been
taken from Kuwait.
   ``They took dairy cows, all the chickens, all the computers, all
the cars,'' he said. ``They took anything moveable, hospital
supplies.''
   And he said he heard many tales of brutality.
   ``I personally know that they did shoot members of families if
they found anything American,'' Briskey said. ``I know people who
saw this happen. They shot people including a 70-year-old
grandfather because a passport was found. I also know that a
pregnant woman was stabbed in the abdomen when she complained about
medical facilities.''
   Asked how he spent his time, Briskey said, ``I listened to the
BBC every hour on the hour and I read a lot. I read the Bible
twice.''
   He said he supports President Bush's actions in the region and
only wishes the buildup of forces had come sooner. He hopes war can
be avoided but said he saw no signs that Saddam Hussein is willing
to withdraw his forces.
   ``Kuwait is not Kuwait anymore,'' he said. ``It is all bunkered.
Ridges are built out of sand with machine guns and all the barbed
wire and the mines.''
   His wife, Marge, said her husband looked tired.
   ``He said he hasn't slept for 12 days,'' she said.
   She also wasn't impressed with the beard.
   ``We'll be getting rid of that,'' she said.

   Rain fell in the northern corners of the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts early today, but skies were clear over much of the rest of
the nation, with another day of fair weather anticipated.
   A cold front over the Pacific Northwest brought showers to
Washington early today and they were expected to move across the
state into Oregon.
   Another cold front over the Atlantic Ocean brought showers to
Maine and upstate New York, with the rain expected to spread over
much of New England.
   Most of the rest of the nation was looking for sunny skies. The
highs were expected to be in the 50s in the Northeast and
Northwest, the 60s in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states, the 70s
in the South and the 80s in the Southwest deserts.
   The high for the nation Friday was 91 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

   The Rockefeller Center tree arrived and the
city's first holiday traffic gridlock alert went out, but with
71-degree temperatures it sure didn't feel a lot like Christmas.
   The 75-foot-tall Norway spruce, donated by a Connecticut man,
was hoisted into place Friday morning right next to the center's
skating rink and down the street from the Radio City Music Hall's
Christmas show.
   The temperature in mid-Manhattan hit a high of 71 degrees a few
hours after the tree was put in place, just one degree short of the
1928 record for the date.
   During the next two weeks, crews will decorate the tree with
20,000 multicolored lights that will blink to life Dec. 3 at a
ceremony hosted by actress-singer Liza Minnelli.
   The tree was donated by Charles Cenci of Norwalk, Conn., in
honor of his father, who planted it in his front yard 61 years ago.
   ``I figured a lot of people would enjoy it,'' Cenci said.
   Cenci offered the tree for the city's annual holiday celebration
eight years ago, but officials said it didn't grow tall enough to
qualify until this year.

<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has
ordered Northwest Airlines to examine 11 of its planes for possible
safety defects, according to a published report.
   The FAA warned that an instrument critical to controlling the
plane has jammed at least six times on A320s operated by foreign
carriers and in test flights, the (Minneapolis) Star Tribune
reported today. The problem involves loss of trim control, which
would affect the nose-up and nose-down angle of the airplane.
   The Star Tribune reports that documents obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act indicate the problem could be even worse
if the loss of the electrical trim actuator was coupled with
malfunctions of two on-board computers that help maneuver the
plane.
   ``This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of
control of the airplane,'' say FAA documents.
   Airbus Industrie, manufacturer of the A20, and Northwest said
the problem can be managed and chances are slim that there would be
a combination of events leading to total loss of control.
   Northwest is the only U.S. carrier flying the European-built
plane, which features a sophisticated ``fly-by-wire'' control
system that relies heavily on computers. Northwest has ordered 89
more of the planes.
   Phoenix-based America West Airlines is adding A320s to its
fleet, which would make it subject to the same FAA directive.

   A husband and wife were in custody
today for allegedly stealing crosses, statues and other items in a
string of church thefts that have occurred since April, authorities
said.
   Nancy Cox, 47, was arrested late Thursday night at the couple's
apartment in nearby South Gate, said Detective Sgt. Mike Woodward.
She was booked for investigation of burglary and held on $5,000
bail.
   Her husband, Stephen Cox, 37, was already in custody in Los
Angeles in connection with an unrelated restaurant burglary. That
investigation led to the wife's arrest, Woodward said Friday.
   ``We believe they are connected to 30 to 100 of the church
burglaries,'' Woodward said. The thefts all took place in Los
Angeles County, authorities said.
   At the couple's apartment, authorities discovered a 14-inch
statue of the Virgin Mary, crosses, radios and other items.
   ``We've already had people from three churches come and identify
items that we recovered,'' Woodward said.

<HEAD>Religious Leader Urges Release of All Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem
cleric today again urged the release of all Western hostages and
many Arab prisoners on humanitarian grounds.
   ``We have to work for closing the file of the hostages and those
unjustifiably detained, be they Iranians, Americans, Europeans or
Lebanese,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said.
   ``This whole file should be closed because it is a humanitarian
issue,'' Fadlallah said in a statement released by his press
office.
   It was the second such plea in two days by the cleric.
   ``To those who think that releasing the hostages would be in
favor of the Western states, we say it would be in favor of
humanity, which is not separate from Islamic values,'' he said.
   Fadlallah is the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, the umbrella organization for
underground Shiite factions believed holding most of the 13
Westerners in Lebanon, including six Americans.
   More than 300 Shiite Moslems are held at the Khiam prison in
south Lebanon, controlled by the Israeli-affiliated South Lebanon
Army militia. Several of them are Hezbollah fighters.
   Hezbollah says an undisclosed number of its members are held by
Christian militias in east Beirut.
   Relatives of four Iranians who disappeared in Lebanon's
Christian enclave in 1982 arrived in Lebanon Tuesday in an effort
to obtain information. They say they had information the four were
held at a prison run by Christian warlord Samir Geagea in the
Faraya ski resort northeast of Beirut.
   Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia said the four were killed by
rival Christian chieftain Elie Hobeika.
   Fadlallah's past statements encouraging the release of foreign
hostages appear to have had no tangible effect on the kidnappers,
despite the influence of his religious authority.
   But when a group calling itself Organization Islamic Dawn
released Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed in April, it said
the releases were partly due to the ``behests of senior religious
leaders.''
   The 13 missing Westerners include six Americans, four Britons,
two Germans and an Italian.
   American journalist Terry Anderson, 43, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - The testimony of nurses was credited
with convicting a woman sentenced to death for spoon-feeding her
boyfriend arsenic-laced food.
   ``Our nurses were wonderful witnesses,'' prosecutor Janet Branch
said Friday after a judge ordered Blanche Taylor Moore, 57, to die
for killing Raymond Reid with poisoned peanut-butter milkshakes and
banana pudding while he lay in a hospital bed four years ago.
   ``Obviously, Mrs. Moore made an attempt to make an impression on
them,'' Ms. Branch said. ``Thus she did, and the nurses' very
reliable memories four years later were probably responsible for
the conviction.''
   The same jury that convicted Mrs. Moore of first-degree murder
on Wednesday recommended the death penalty on Friday after
deliberating four hours. Forsyth County Superior Court Judge
William Freeman set the execution date for Jan. 18, 1991. Death
sentences in North Carolina are automatically appealed.
   As the jury's recommendation was read, Mrs. Moore sighed and
said very quietly: ``My God.''
   If her appeals fail, Mrs. Moore would choose between death by
gas or lethal injection.
   Defense attorneys said they expect to do better during their
appeals.
   ``Our belief is this verdict and judgment will not stand the
scrutiny of the appellate court,'' defense lawyer Mitchell McEntire
said. ``It's round one of a difficult fight.''
   Mrs. Moore also is charged in the poisoning death of her first
husband, James Taylor, in 1973, and the poisoning of her estranged
husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore, who became sick after their
honeymoon last year but survived. She may be tried later on those
charges.
   Reid, of Kernersville, died in October 1986 at North Carolina
Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. He was 50.
   Investigators began looking into the deaths of Reid and Taylor
after doctors discovered last year that Mrs. Moore's estranged
husband had been poisoned.
   Prosecutors said during the four-week trial that Mrs. Moore was
driven by a need for money and that she killed Reid to gain part of
his estate.

<TEXT>
   An agreement could be completed this weekend
that would mark a major breakthrough in a two-decade-old effort to
compensate thousands of people injured by asbestos fibers, a lawyer
said.
   Victims would be compensated according to the severity of their
illness, rather than a highly criticized system under which claims
were processed based on the time of filing.
   Peter Angelos, a Baltimore asbestos victims' attorney involved
in restructuring negotiations, said Friday the majority of a
seven-member committee of plaintiffs' lawyers had approved the
plan.
   The deal would also have to be approved by U.S. District Judge
Jack B. Weinstein, who earlier this year ordered the overhaul of
the Manville trust fund set up to compensate asbestos victims. The
trust has 130,000 claims pending.
   A restructuring would cap a year of turmoil that began when the
trust said it had run out of cash to pay future claims and that
some asbestos victims would not be compensated until well into the
next century.
   Leon Silverman, the New York lawyer appointed by Weinstein to
restructure the trust, declined comment Friday.
   The Manville trust was created in 1988 as part of the bankruptcy
court reorganization of Manville Corp., which declared Chapter 11
six years earlier because it couldn't meet its liability from
asbestos lawsuits.
   Denver-based Manville was once the nation's largest asbestos
manufacturers.
   Asbestos is a mineral used widely for decades in shipbuilding,
contruction and other industries. It later was found to cause lung
cancer and other serious and often fatal diseases.

<TEXT>
   NATO's top military commander in Europe
says he welcomes the new conventional arms accord, but that he's
concerned some Soviet weaponry already removed from Eastern Europe
won't be destroyed under the treaty.
   The treaty does not take effect until its signing, scheduled for
Monday in Paris.
   Moscow has said it has already moved 20,000 tanks, 24,000
artillery pieces and 800 aircraft to east of the Ural Mountains,
out of the treaty area between those mountains and the Atlantic.
   ``They are a concern to me,'' U.S. General John Galvin said
Friday. ``They are not in an offensive deployment (but that does)
not take away my worries,'' Galvin, NATO's top commander in Europe,
told reporters.
   But he and other NATO officials welcomed the Conventional Forces
in Europe accord, finalized by negotiators from the 16 NATO and six
Warsaw Pact nations on Thursday, as a political and military
milestone.
   One official said Moscow ``is aware of our concerns'' that arms,
subject to be removed under the CFE treaty, do not remain
operational east of the Urals.
   ``We have been given assurances'' this will not happen, said the
official, who asked not to be named. He said North Atlantic Treaty
Organization will remain ``vigilant'' and monitor the situation.
   NATO officials say the Soviet arms already transferred to east
of the Ural Mountains are in unprotected storage and bound to
deteriorate.
   The CFE treaty is to be signed Monday by the leaders of the NATO
and Warsaw Pact nations in Paris in the margin of a 34-nation
East-West summit.
   Only days later, the NATO and Warsaw Pact states will open talks
on a follow-up accord on troop levels across Europe.
   The CFE treaty will bring about, over three years, a 40 percent
cut in battle tanks, armored cars, artillery, combat planes and
assault helicopters.
   In all, 100,000 such items are to go - 90,000 on the Warsaw Pact
side, mostly the Soviet Union, and 10,000 on NATO's - leaving
250,000 such arms systems in place overall.
   The CFE treaty provides for verification of efforts to destroy
weapons to ensure each alliance will end up with no more than
20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored cars, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800
combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters within the treaty
area.

<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry has threatened to
expel U.N. or other refugee officials who assist Burmese dissidents
living in Thailand, newspapers reported today.
   Thailand has close ties with the military government that took
power in Burma two years ago by brutally crushing a student-led
movement for democracy. Thousands fled the suppression and joined
armed rebel groups in areas bordering Thailand and India.
   The Bangkok government began reconsidering the status of Burmese
asylum seekers after two Burmese students hijacked a Thai airliner
flying to their homeland on Nov. 10. Two other Burmese students
hijacked an jetliner to Thailand a year ago.
   The Nation newspaper said Chamnarn Potjana, deputy permanent
secretary of the Interior Ministry, on Friday warned international
organizations and aid agencies to stop assisting Burmese students.
   If they did not, ``no matter whether they are officials of the
UNHCR (U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees) or other United Nations
agencies, we will ask the Foreign Ministry to expel them from the
country as persona non grata,'' Chamnarn was quoted as saying.
   A Western relief official said on condition of anonymity that
the situation of Burmese students in Thailand had become very
serious. He said the High Commissioner was reviewing its assistance
to the students.
   ``We have responsibility for these people (students) and we have
to fulfill our obligations. At the same time we must take into
account the Thai position,'' he said.
   Thaung Htun, a spokesman for the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front, said the Thai government ``should consider the problem of
Burmese students from a humanitarian point of view. Any person who
fled should have the rights of a refugee.''
   Chamnarn spoke after a Cabinet committee meeting to discuss what
measures to take regarding the students. He said the committee had
recommended the establishment of a holding camp for Burmese
dissidents on the Thai-Burma border.
   The Nation quoted Chamnarn as saying the High Commissioner
should use the $120,000 monthly allowance it had for Burmese
students to establish the camp.
   The private U.S. Committee for Refugees estimates there are
2,000 Burmese students living in Bangkok. Another 2,700 are on the
Thai-Burma border, according to the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front, the main group of exiled students.
   Thailand considers the students illegal immigrants subject to
detention, fines and deportation. They depend on the aid of private
relief groups and grants from the U.N. High Commissioner ranging
from $40 to $120 a month.
   According to the U.S. Committee for Refugees, Thailand has
repatriated more than 5,200 Burmese, many of them students, since
1988. Amnesty International has cited reports that Burmese
authorities have brutally interrogated and tortured some students
repatriated from Thailand.
   The Bangkok Post quoted Chamnarn as saying that in addition to
the hijacking, Burmese students were thought responsible for a
recent small bomb attack on the Burmese Embassy compound in
Bangkok. He said Thailand would deport those who violated its
immigration law and penal code.

   The spill of up to 6 million gallons of crude oil
by a Norwegian-flagged tanker does not pose a threat to the
coastline, U.S. Coast Guard and company officials said.
   The tanker lost between 4 million gallons and 6 million gallons
of oil after it was damaged in stormy seas earlier this week in the
north Atlantic. The leak has stopped, said an official with the
company that owns the ship.
   ``In the heavy weather, the pounding it took caused some
structural damage to the forepeak, or the forward part of the
ship,'' Lt. Brian Crenzine of the Coast Guard in New York said
today.
   The tanker Berge Broker spilled the Arabian light crude oil
about 700 miles southeast of Nova Scotia, Lt. Richard Gill of the
U.S. Coast Guard in Boston said Friday.
   The ship, bound for Newfoundland, found itself in the middle of
a fierce Atlantic storm Tuesday that damaged two tanks, which
emptied into the ocean, Crenzine said.
   No other oil escaped and the vessel remained seaworthy, Crenzine
said.
   Jim McGrenachan, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in New York,
said chances were slim the spill would make it to land.
   ``Some oil has been released,'' McGrenachan said. ``The tanker
was in rough seas. Right now we're not even responding. It doesn't
seem to be any kind of threat to anybody. It's pretty far out
there. It's so far out in the middle of nowhere.''
   On Friday the ship was moving toward a rendezvous with a sister
ship, which will take on the Berge Broker's remaining oil cargo,
Gill said.
   Kjell Roevik, the director of Bergesen dy AS, owner of the ship,
said in a telephone interview today from his home in Oslo that the
leak had been stopped and the Berge Broker was heading southeast.
   ``It is a very light oil, it is broken down at once and will not
reach land. ... It is in the middle of the Atlantic,'' Roevik said.
No cleanup efforts were planned, he said.

   Security forces fired shotguns
and rubber bullets and used dogs today to break up a march through
the city by hundreds of blacks calling for the abolition of black
township councils.
   Police opened fire after about 700 protesters ignored an order
to disperse because the march had been banned. The marchers fled in
panic as police opened fire with rubber bullets and tear gas.
   At least four people were wounded by shotgun fire.
   In another march in Cape Town, police baton-charged protesters.
A group of about 200 people trying to join an African National
Congress march on Parliament said police beat them with batons.
   Police used tear gas to disperse a third protest in the
Johannesburg township of Toekomsrus. Officials said small groups of
people gathered illegally and threw stones at police.
   An anti-apartheid group, the Civic Association of the Southern
Transvaal urged protests to demand abolition of black township
councils. The Association and the ANC allege the councils
collaborate with the white-led government to perpetuate apartheid.
   Heavily armed army soldiers in brown battle fatigues were called
out in Johannesburg when protesters began hurling rocks and bottles
at police vehicles after the march was dispersed.
   Police officers crouching behind their vehicles fired shotgun
blasts up at surrounding apartment buildings. Residents leaning out
of windows hurled bottles and yelled curses at the security forces.
   ``South Africa belongs to us. Get away from here,'' screamed one
enraged woman. Protesters chanted, ``ANC, ANC.''
   Police used shotguns and tear gas to disperse protesters who
attempted to reassemble. Officers unleashed police dogs into the
crowds and several people were bitten.
   Police pulled back several times to try to defuse the
situtation. But running clashes broke out again when cheering
protesters swarmed into roads, blocking traffic.
   Running clashes continued for more than three hours near the
city's main post office. Police said one police officer was
injured, but they had no overall details on injuries or arrests.
   About 3,000 people took part in the Cape Town march. There were
no incidents in the march itself, which had been given official
permission.
   Demands presented to government officials called for the
immediate abolition of black town councils.
   President F.W. de Klerk is dismantling apartheid and has
promised to share power with the black majority. But laws
segregating residential areas remain in effect, and most blacks
live in squalid townships.
   A statement by march organizers said most blacks believed little
had changed despite de Klerk's reforms.
   ``These demands and actions flow from our sincere commitment to
peace and our belief that South Africans must come together to
build a just, non-racial and democratic country where we can be
truly proud to bring up the generations of the future,'' the
statement said.
   Regional ANC publicity secretary, Trevor Manuel, said the
protest showed that there was ``a big chasm between what state
president de Klerk and his Cabinet are saying to the world and what
they are actually delivering.''

<TEXT>
   Dozens of startled residents in
southern San Diego County called police to report a UFO, which
turned out to be a blimp on its maiden advertising voyage.
   Lighted brightly in the night sky to attract attention, the
blimp did exactly that Friday night. Police in Chula Vista,
National City and San Diego say they got a number of calls from
residents worried about an invasion from outer space.
   ``People think they are seeing UFOs and it's weird,'' a Chula
Vista police dispatcher said. ``They see a big thing glowing in the
sky and then want to call us.''
   The suspected flying saucer is owned by San Diego-based Virgin
Lightships, which is part of the London-based business group that
includes Virgin Atlantic Airways.
   It arrived this week at its new base at Brown Field in Otay
Mesa, and was making its first voyage through the area as an
advertising ploy.
   Company officials say up to 23 of the blimps are scheduled to be
built within five years to advertise for clients throughout the
United States and Europe. They rent for about $250,000 a month.
   Chula Vista is about 10 miles south of downtown San Diego.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today proposed a
government overhaul that would give republics more influence and
could force out Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who has resisted
swift reform.
   The move appeared to be a concession to Gorbachev's main rival
and frequent critic, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who had
demanded a coalition government and Ryzhkov's resignation.
   Speaking to the Supreme Soviet legislature, Gorbachev also said
an emergency program will be drafted within two weeks to deal with
growing food shortages. He did not give details.
   In today's 12-minute speech, Gorbachev elaborated on some of the
ideas he introduced in a speech Friday. That speech came at the
demand of lawmakers, who insisted the president give an emergency
report on the state of the union.
   Gorbachev's proposals aim to calm growing discontent over the
country's collapsing economy and the increasing rebelliousness
among the republics, all but one of which have made declarations of
sovereignty.
   ``I appeal to citizens of all 15 republics to support these
undelayable measures,'' Gorbachev said today. The separatist
movement must be stopped, he said. ``We cannot break up (the
union). We cannot go down this path.''
   Gorbachev did not make it clear whether he could implement the
proposals on his own or if they needed ratification by Soviet
lawmakers.
   But Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, told
legislators that the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies,
which meets next month, would have to approve any constitutional
amendments for government restructuring.
   Under Gorbachev's proposals, the Council of Ministers headed by
Ryzhkov would be replaced by several bodies under direct
presidential control. The principal ruling body would be the
Federation Council, which would include representatives of the
republics.
   Legislators generally welcomed the proposed elimination of
Ryzhkov's job, but unless the republics agree to join the
Federation Council, the restructuring is unlikely to solve the
paralysis of power in the country.
   Initial reaction from some republics was negative.
   An Estonia lawmaker said her republic and the two other Baltic
states of Latvia and Lithuania would not join the council.
   ``We will not take part in any old or new institution which is
an institution of federation,'' Marju Lauristin, deputy speaker of
Estonia's parliament, told reporters.
   She suggested the restructuring was an attempt to establish a
dictatorship.
   ``It is concentrating all power in the economy in politics in
military affairs in one (person's) hands,'' she said.
   The Baltics have said that their incorporation into the Soviet
Union in 1940 was illegal and have launched independence drives.
   Gorbachev said the Federation Council, formed in March, would be
strengthened and would meet more regularly.
   ``Out of a consultative body it should be transformed into an
effective structure to coordinate the efforts of the center and the
republics,'' he said. Many republics have nullified national
legislation and presidential decrees and have declared their laws
supreme. The new structure was designed to end such conflicts.
   Ryzhkov told reporters he had no idea what new role he might
have in the new structure, and said he learned of it only 20
minutes before Gorbachev's speech. But he said his job was being
eliminated.
   ``I understood that the position of chairman of the Council of
Ministers won't exist. There will be presidential rule, a
presidential Cabinet,'' Ryzhkov said.
   Politicians, demonstrators and commentators have demanded
Ryzhkov's resignation for at least a year. Yeltsin has said the
country cannot solve its economic crisis as long as Ryzhkov and his
Cabinet were in place.
   Asked if he were willing to remain in a government job, Ryzhkov
told reporters, ``I will work as long as the people need me.''
   Ryzhkov, 61, was appoined head of the Council of Ministers in
September 1985. Previously, he was director of the Uralmash machine
building complex in the Ural Mountains city of Sverdlovsk.
   The Federation Council, comprised of the leaders of the 15
republics and headed by Gorbachev, has been meeting only
sporadically and has not taken a major role in policy-making.
   Gorbachev said that with the strengthening of the Federation
Council, the 18-member Presidential Council, created last March to
implement domestic and foreign policy, would be eliminated.
   To strengthen law and order, which many Soviets have complained
is breaking down, Gorbachev said that presidential representatives
will be appointed and sent to regions of the country.
   Under recent constitutional amendments, Gorbachev has the power
to impose direct presidential rule in restive areas of the country.
The Soviet leader appeared to be moving closer to this step with
the announcement of the stationing of his representatives in those
areas.

   All but one Communist lawmaker left the Parliament session in
protest, refusing to take part in Friday night's vote, the Lidove

   The state CTK news agency said the measure was approved by 101
of the 103 deputies present and voting in the House of the People.
One deputy voted against it and one abstained.
   In the second chamber, the House of Nations, 52 of 55 deputies
present and voting in the Slovak chamber cast ballots in favor. All
55 Czech deputies approved the new law.
   The measure was introduced in the house Friday by Deputy Premier
Pavel Rychetsky, who stressed that the party's debts to society
``are much higher than the value of the property that is now under
discussion.''
   Last month, the government proposed seizing all Communist Party
property without compensation, in a move pointing to growing anger
at the former rulers at a time of economic hardship.
   Czechoslovak media said last month that Communist property is
worth about $237.5 million, a year after the peaceful revolution
that ended Communist rule.
   Government officials said Communist assets totaled $512 million
before the revolution. The Communists themselves valued their
remaining property at $94 million.
   The government froze party assets on May 18, starting the
process of gradual transfer of property to the new authorities.
   Party property includes many buildings, communications
equipment, recreation centers, newspapers, and other assets.
   Several Communist deputies called for ammendments to the bill
and others rejected it.
   Miroslav Ransdorf, a deputy of the Communist Party of Slovakia,
charged the bill was aimed at distracting attention from the
economic crisis, weakening the opposition, and boosting the
flagging prestige of the Civic Forum movement.
   Ransdorf also charged that the bill was designed to destroy the
Communist Party economically, Lidove Noviny reported.
   President Vaclav Havel's Civic Forum and its sister organization
in Slovakia, Public Against Violence, are the largest groupings in
Parliament and the senior partners in the government coalition.
   Political differences within the Civic Forum over whether it
should continue as a loose movement encompassing a wide spectrum of
political views or become a political party have hurt its
popularity.
   Czechoslovaks go to the polls next weekend to vote in municipal
elections.
   Prior to the formal voting, all Communist deputies except
Miroslav Jansta, left the assembly.
   ``The Communists have given up their leading role and ideology
more easily than their property,'' Lidove Noviny commented.
   The Communist party voted last November, after huge
anti-government street demonstrations, to drop from the
constitution the party's guaranteed leading role, which had ensured
its domination of society and politics for 41 years.

   King Hussein, who has been reluctant to
side with the West in the Persian Gulf crisis, today harshly
criticized the United States for applying what he called double
standards in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Addressing the opening session of Parliament, the king suggested
any solution to the gulf standoff should be linked to the
Arab-Israeli conflict. Iraq's Saddam Hussein has taken the same
position.
   The Jordanian monarch also assailed the U.S.-led military
buildup in the gulf region, and told lawmakers he hoped Jordan's
strained relations with Saudi Arabia and other gulf states could be
mended soon.
   State-run Jordan television and radio carried the king's
40-minute address live. Government offices declared today an
unofficial holiday and allowed employees for voluntary leave if
they wished to attend the parliamentary session.
   The 80-member Chamber of Deputies, elected a year ago in
nationwide general elections, met jointly with the 40-member Senate
to hear the speech. The king spoke from his throne, wearing a
black-and-gold ceremonial military uniform.
   Jordan has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but also
is seeking an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, captured from Jordan in 1967. The territories are land
claimed by the Palestinians.
   ``This duality ... forces us to inquire why there has been
incessant refusal to link the two crises despite the fact that
resolutions have been adopted by the United Nations,'' he said.
   The king, facing an economic crunch as a result of the gulf
crisis, renewed an appeal for financial assistance from gulf
states, formerly his main financial backers, as well as emergency
aid from the international community.
   Jordan's relations with gulf states suffered because it dragged
its feet in complying with the United Nations sanctions against
Iraq. The Amman government says it now enforces the embargo except
for crude oil that Jordan receives.
   Jordanian officials say their economy would be crippled without
the Iraqi oil, which is a form of debt payment, pegged at $16 a
barrel.
   In apparent reference to the United States and its allies in the
anti-Iraq coalition, Hussein accused unnamed world powers of
``blatant and shameless conduct'' in the gulf region, saying greed
was their main motive.
   ``Their actual goals stem from the desire to control our destiny
and the Arab nation's resources,'' he said.
   Criticizing the military buildup in the region, he denounced
``unyielding positions and economic strangulation in the gulf.''
   He attacked the West's ``complacent stand toward Israeli
aggression while assuming the role of defenders of international
legitimacy and human rights.''
   The king also affirmed he would continue to support the
Palestine Liberation Organization ``in all possible ways.''

   Four Sikh militants armed with AK-47
assault rifles opened fire on a group of Hindu fundamentalists
exercising in a Punjab park today, killing 10 men and wounding 10,
police said.
   Four of the wounded were in serious condition after the early
morning attack in Quillewali, 120 miles south of Amritsar, a center
of the Sikh separatist movement. Four of the wounded were in
serious condition.
   The Sikhs fired on about 25 people from the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh, or the National Self-reliance Group, according
to Swaran Singh, senior superintendent of the district police
headquarters at Faridkot.
   He said the victims were from Dhalbhwali town, which is
separated from Quillewali by a state highway. They had assembled in
the park for the daily physical training exercises mandatory for
members of the Hindu group.
   Singh said the gunmen, who drove up in a red car, escaped.
   The Self-reliance group aims to establish a Hindu India and is
an affiliate of the right-wing political party, the Bharatiya
Janata.
   It was the fifth attack on members of the group since 1988. In
the worst attack, 23 Hindus were killed in Punjab's Moga town in
June 1989. Four other attacks on the group took place in 1988.
   Sikh militants have killed 2,790 people so far this year in
Punjab, a rich farming state where they have fought since 1982 to
establish an independent nation for members of their faith.
   Sikhs have a slight majority over Hindus in Punjab, which
adjoins Haryana state on the east and Pakistan on the west.
   Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people. Sikh separatists claim political and economic
discrimination by Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of the national
population.

   Sixth, on the Union Treaty, the common denominator of our
approach and our understanding is that the union must be renovated
and preserved. There were speeches with or without references to
Lenin yesterday: first divide, then unite. If what is meant, and
Comrade Boiko is quite correct here, is a division of competence
and powers, qualitative renovation of the entire system of vertical
and horizontal relationships, I think it would be supported by all
of us, including me personally. But I am categorically against a
fragmentation of the state, a redesigning of territorial divisions,
destroying centuries-old relationships of people. It is easier for
me to say this now: our own bitter experience tinged with the blood
of our citizens has, I think, taught us that we cannot separate.
(Applause) That is why we must not embark on that road. Without
delay and with all due attention, we must tackle the division of
powers and authority, implement everything that is contained in our
concept of renovating our multi-ethnic state. If there is oxygen,
the health of all nations will be good. I think that the Supreme
Soviet must speak out in favor of it, and the people must be
informed about its position.
   The draft of the Union Treaty is basically ready. We will submit
it as soon as possible to the Supreme Soviet of the Union and the
Supreme Soviets of republics. And don't let us be intimidated by
the newly emerging fighters for sovereignty, who say that the
people are saying (so and so). The people should be asked first.
(Applause) It was done in the Ukraine at the most critical periods,
and there were never less than 70 percent of those who supported
preserving and renovating the union. The same happens everywhere. I
am even now getting reports from Georgia. They were very concerned
when they heard statements that ties are being torn that it took
centuries to establish.
   Seventh, I think it necessary to stress once again the
importance of giving more attention to the problems of the army, to
social security of the members of the military and their families.
The army is the child of the people. I am repeating the formula
which has provided our point of reference for years. Once again I
am appealing to the Supreme Soviet to make laws without delay to
make it possible for the army to perform its functions and to
ensure the prestige of those who safeguard the security of our
state.
   Eighth, it is our duty to help maximum coordination and
interaction of soviets. It obviously follows from yesterday's
discussion that neither the Supreme Soviet nor local soviets can
operate efficiently without the closest coordination and
interaction. It is in the interests of our common cause that we
reject confrontation, fruitless competition.
   Comrades, the proposed tasks are aimed at the fulfillment of our
strategic goals, further progress of democratic changes in the
country. I am appealing to the citizens of all 15 republics to
support this program of practical measures, which outline
organizational prerequisites for the fulfillment of decisions that
have been taken. None of the decisions should be allowed to be
suspended, and I, as president, will concern myself with their
exact implementation.
   I am hoping to get the support of all those who are interested
in the success of the common cause, the cooperation of all national
groups in the country, all creative forces who hold close to their
hearts the goals of all-union accord, civic peace, stability
without which we will be unable to move further. And those who will
oppose these feelings of the people must be defeated politically.
(Applause)
   I am appealing to communists to use all opportunities
opportunities to energetically support measures for economic,
political and legal stability. I am inviting the cooperation of all
public organizations and movements which value the destiny of our
motherland. Mass media workers should rethink their role. In other
words, let's stop spreading discord and panic, let's proceed to
construction. Our future lies only in energetic movement ahead, in
achieving the common goals we set ourselves. I appeal to the
Supreme Soviet to support these proposals. (Applause)

   President Bush, celebrating the
first anniversary of the revolution that toppled Czechoslovakia's
communist rule, promised this struggling nation today that ``we
will not fail you in this decisive moment.''
   ``America will stand with you,'' he vowed in a speech to the
Federal Assembly just hours after arriving here for the first ever
U.S. presidential visit and again to a rally in Wenceslas Square,
site of many turning points in Czechoslovakia's turbulent history.
Bush also vowed the West would not leave Eastern Europe in a
military ``no man's land.''
   Bush also tied the past year of revolution in Europe to the
crisis in the Persian Gulf, saying ``I have this feeling in my
heart that no peoples understand better what is at stake in the
gulf than Czechs and Slovaks.''
   ``You know from your own bitter experience that the world cannot
turn a blind eye to aggression. You know the futility and vain hope
that aggressors can be appeased,'' he said.
   President Vaclav Havel said Czechoslovakia's own history ``has
taught us ample lessons about the consequences of appeasement.''
One-third of Czechoslovakia's territory was ceded in 1938 to the
Nazis in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Adolf Hitler from
conquering other countries.
   ``It is necessary to resist evil, it is necessary to resist
aggression,'' the one-time dissident said.
   Bush also said the United States would not leave the fledgling
democracies of Eastern Europe dangling with no security. ``We do
not want to see Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary off in some
kind of no man's land,'' he said, now that the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact has turned into a political rather than military alliance.
   Bush said the United States has ``an enormous stake'' in the
security of Eastern Europe, a subject that will be addressed in a
summit next week of 34 nations in Paris.
   Bush said he and Havel did not discuss future security
arrangements in any detail, although he did say it came up. He
suggested the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
group sponsoring next week's Paris summit, would take a more active
role in determining Europe's direction in the post Cold War era.
   The two leaders were wrapped in heavy topcoats against the
overcast chill of the Prague afternoon. At the rally, more than
100,000 people crowded into Wenceslas Square and down its long
rectangular boulevard to hear Bush and Havel, who laid wreaths at a
popular shrine to those who died under communism.
   Havel said his nation still faces difficult struggles in trying
to move from a communist to a capitalist society.
   He said ``the fact remains that dissatisfaction, nervousness,
insecurity and disillusionment are widespread in our society.''
   Bush, by contrast, was upbeat.
   ``Czechoslovakia's revolution is over,'' Bush said. ``Its
renaissance has just begun. ... Your nation, like your neighbors to
the north and south, faces the unprecedented task for building
stable democratic rule and a prosperous market economy on the ruins
of totalitarianism.''
   The president declared, ``I am here to say that we will not fail
you in this decisive moment.''
   He said final agreement was reached today allowing
Czechoslovakia to enjoy the benefits of most-favored-nation trade
status, permitting it to deal with the United States at the lowest
possible tariffs and import fee rates. Bush said he also would ask
Congress for $60 million to create a fund to spur U.S. investment
here.
   Moreover, Bush said funds to help build the private sector would
be drawn from the $370 million already committed for Central and
Eastern Europe for the coming year.
   Noting that Czechoslovakia and its neighbors are braced for
seere energy problems, Bush said he had asked the International
Monetary Fund to lend up to $5 billion in 1991 to Central and
Eastern Europe. The World Bank will commit an additional $9 billion
over the next three years, Bush said.
   On a political note, Bush said he agrees that Prague should be
the home of the permanent secretariat of the CSCE, the
loosely-defined 34-nation assembly that served as a forum for
East-West talks during the Cold War.
   ``It is right that this city - once on the fault line of Cold
War and conflict - now at the heart of the new and united Europe -
play a central role as the CSCE seeks to expand the frontiers of
freedom in Europe,'' Bush said.
   Bush, setting out on an eight-day trip to Europe and the Middle
East, arrived here to a 21-gun salute. American and Czechoslovak
flags snapped in the wind in the courtyard of The Castle, where
Havel and Bush held talks. A military honor guard stood resplendent
in new navy uniforms modeled on the garb of West Point, replacing
the drab green Soviet-style uniforms of the communist era.
   Clusters of well-wishers, many of them waving American flags,
stood along the streets of Prague to greet Bush.
   Prague was the first stop on a journey that also will take the
president to Germany, a 34-nation summit in Paris, a Thanksgiving
Day visit with troops in Saudi Arabia and talks in Cairo with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``This wide-ranging trip will take us from the salons of Europe
to the sands of Saudi Arabia,'' Bush said in a statement. ``Each
stop is meant to bolster the peace, freedom and prosperity that
Americans enjoy and for which we should give thanks throughout the
year.''
   The centerpiece of the visit to Europe will be the signing on
Monday of a treaty slashing non-nuclear weapons, the most sweeping
agreement in history to reduce weapons arsenals. Yet, Bush said the
highlight of the whole trip would be spending the Thanksgiving
holiday with U.S. forces.
   Upwards of 250,000 American troops have been deployed to the
gulf and Bush has ordered an additional 200,000 to go there to be
ready for a possible war with Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait.

   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who would lose
his job in the government overhaul proposed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, set ambitious goals when he took the post in 1985.
   One of his first and toughest tasks was to trim the bloated
bureacracy inherited from the ``era of stagnation'' under the
leadership of Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   Gorbachev initiated the political and economic restructuring
known as ``perestroika'' shortly after he became leader in 1985,
and Ryzhkov was a key lieutenant in implementing reforms.
   But the 61-year-old prime minister has not always agreed with
his boss. ``Sometimes I clashed with him on practical issues,'' he
said in an interview last summer with the magazine Arguments and
Facts.
   During his five-year tenure, Ryzhkov eliminated 25 ministries
and dozens of other central officers were dismantled. In the
interview, he described efforts to pare down the entrenched
bureaucracy as ``a battle royal.''
   Nevertheless, it was the same bureaucracy that he climbed
through to reach the post considered the second most powerful in
the country.
   Ryzhkov was born on Sept. 28, 1929, to a miner's family. After
graduating from the Urals Polytechnical Institute with a degree in
engineering, he began working in 1950 at the giant Uralmash
machine-building complex in Sverdlovsk. Twenty years later he
became its director-general.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1956 and became active in
politics with his appointment to the Supreme Soviet Commission on
Planning and Budget in 1974. In 1981, he became a full member of
the party's Central Committee.
   In 1985, six weeks after Gorbachev became general secretary,
Ryzhkov was appointed a full member of the Communist Party
Politburo. He was named chairman of the Council of Ministers in
September of that year.
   During his first years as prime minister, Ryzhkov was largely
regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of a
high-profile Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for
victims of the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia.
   ``Thanks to his TV image, many thought Ryzhkov a soft and
irresolute man,'' the Novosti news agency said in a 1989 profile.
``That was so until the Armenian earthquake at the end of last
year. The world then saw another man. The mask of reservation fell
to reveal frankness and undisguised passionate pity.''
   But his popularity proved short-lived.
   Blame for the abysmal economic conditions sweeping the country
was laid at his feet. For the past year, Supreme Soviet lawmakers,
demonstrators and intellectuals have demanded the resignation of
Ryzhkov and his government.
   ``Almost each parliamentary session over the past year began
with demands for the resignation of the government, and this
session hears the same demand,'' Ryzhkov told lawmakers Saturday.
   ``All this prevents the normal functioning of the supreme
executive power body,'' he said. ``The atmosphere created around
the government, in fact, dooms its decisions to
non-implementation.''
   Ryzhkov appeared philosophical about the imminent demise of his
job, saying he only learned of Gorbachev's proposals 20 minutes
before they were presented to the Supreme Soviet.
   ``I understood that the position of chairman of the Council of
Ministers won't exist. There will be presidential rule, a
presidential Cabinet,'' he said. The job of vice president,
included in the Gorbachev proposal, was not offered to him, Ryzhkov
said.
   Despite the uncertainty of his future, Ryzhkov said he supported
Gorbachev's restructuring plans.
   But, he said, things will be just as tough under the new setup
as they were under his government.
   ``It will be just as hard for them as us, because our life is
such,'' Ryzhkov said. ``We really are at a pivotal stage when the
old structure is still being broken down and the new one is being
born.''

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today his talks with three African nations yielded positive results
in lining up support for a resolution authorizing the use of force
against Iraq.
   Zaire's foreign minister, Kalimba Wakatana Mushobekwa, said his
government would back such a resolution if it were introduced in
the United Nations Security Council.
   ``Yes, we support it,'' he told reporters.
   Baker also met with the foreign ministers of Ethiopia and the
Ivory Coast before heading to Paris to lobby the foreign ministers
of Romania, Finland, Britain and the Soviet Union on the proposed
resolution.
   ``I think we've had a positive day consulting with other members
of the (Security) Council,'' Baker said but refused to elaborate.
   ``I don't want to get into the business of counting votes here
or predicting results or anything like that. But we've had some
good meetings today,'' he said.
   At the end of the weekend Baker will have met with foreign
ministers of eight of the 15 nations that are members of the
Security Council, where a resolution on the use of force would have
to be approved.
   Baker has maintained that the United States has not yet decided
if it will seek the resolution, which would authorize the use of
military force to get Iraq out of Kuwait if peaceful means failed.
   ``I haven't seen a draft resolution yet,'' he said here
Saturday.
   Even so, the United States appears prepared to circulate by the
end of the month the resolution in the Security Council as a last
resort to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, which it has occupied since
Aug. 2.
   U.S. officials have said they would like to introduce the
resolution this month while holding the chairmanship of the
Security Council.
   Diplomats at the United Nations said Baker is lobbying foreign
ministers from the Security Council nations to vote in person on
any use-of-force resolution.
   The ministers would lend weight to the resolution and bolster
the image of allied unity if they turned out for the vote, since
they seldom occupy their countries' seats on the council except in
very grave situations.
   ``Are we now, on the margins of the council, discussing a new
resolution that would turn the screws on Saddam Hussein? The answer
is yes,'' Canadian Ambassador Yves Fortier said Friday.
   Thirteen foreign ministers attended Sept. 25 when the council
voted 14-1 to expand its economic embargo to include specifically
all air cargo traffic in or out of Iraq and Kuwait.
   However, most were already in New York for the General
Assembly's first week of debate and the World Children's Summit.
   Several foreign ministers attended the July 1987 Security
Council meeting that adopted the cease-fire and peace plan for the
Iran-Iraq war, Resolution 598.
   Baker has already conferred with Joe Clark, Canada's external
affairs minister, and broached the idea of the foreign ministers
coming to New York, according to Fortier.
   ``The Americans ... may wish to stress the importance of the
meeting by holding it at the ministerial level,'' Fortier said.
   America and the Soviet Union both have drafted ``use of force''
resolutions, according to diplomats in New York and Washington
officials.
   ``There are a number of concepts that are in play,'' Fortier
said.
   Diplomats say the U.S. version would contain some kind of
ultimatum; it would refer to authorizing use of force at some point
in the near future, when economic sanctions on Baghdad have
tightened.
   European diplomats who saw the Soviet document say it would put
heavy reliance on the so-far passive Military Staff Committee of
the Security Council. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   That committee's function, under the U.N. Charter, is to
``advise and assist'' on its military requirements, including ``the
employment and command of forces placed at its disposal.''

<TEXT>
   Anti-government demonstrators rampaged
through the capital today setting fire to several vehicles, stoning
a Cabinet minister's house and burning an effigy of the president.
   Police fired tear gas and used steel-tipped batons to disperse
crowds, who hurled stones and small home-made bombs at security
forces.
   Amanullah Aman, head of Dhaka University's student union, said
25 people were injured, including five shot by Ershad supporters
armed with pistols and sawed-off shotguns. His claim could not be
immediately confirmed.
   Most protesters were students who support opposition parties.
   The opposition launched a new round of strikes and rallies to
demand the resignation of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who
took power in a military coup in 1982. He was elected president in
1986 and plans to run again in 1991.
   The opposition parties have refused to participate in future
elections unless Ershad resigns, claiming his last election was
rigged.
   At least eight people have been shot and killed by police since
the latest round of protests began five weeks ago.
   Groups of 100 to 300 people roamed the streets, chanting ``down
with Ershad'' and ``no election under a dictator.''
   ``My government is determined to crush the anarchic and
terrorist activities that have been let loose in the country,''
Ershad told about 8,000 supporters at a rally a mile from the main
trouble spots.
   Without elaborating, the president said: ``Some outsiders are
behind the current troubles. They will be wiped out by the
people.''
   The rally was one of nine scheduled over the next few days in
Dhaka by Ershad's Jatiya Party to counter what it called ``anarchy
and terrorism launched by the opposition.'' But the pro-government
rallies only heightened the tension in this city of 7 million
people.
   Anti-Ershad demonstrators ransacked a platform erected for a
Jatiya Party rally near the 5-star Sheraton Hotel, United News of
Bangladesh said.
   University students had called for a siege of Cabinet ministers'
homes, but police set up barbed wire barricades on streets leading
to the official residences in the center of the city.
   The trouble started when about 1,000 protesters tried to break
through the barricades. Police used tear gas and batons to disperse
the crowd, which split into smaller groups and roamed the streets.
   The protesters burned an effigy of Ershad near the National
Press Club and hurled stones at the residence of Irrigation
Minister Ghulam Mostafa, United News of Bangladesh said. Several
cars were burned.
   Reporters saw about a dozen protesters rounded up by police near
Dhaka University campus.
   At least three police motorbikes, a jeep and a minibus were set
afire by the protesters, reporters at the scenes said.
   The campaign for Ershad's resignation is led Bangladesh's two
biggest opposition parties - Sheik Hasina's Awami League and
Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

   The government announced it
will bore holes in a small dam to provide water for hippos stranded
in a drought-stricken section of South Africa.
   The Department of Water had earlier refused to take action to
save the hippos living on a patch of land near the Limpopo River,
saying releasing water from the nearby dam could hurt industry in
the area. On Friday, it announced a change of heart and said
experts would begin the project in the northern Transvaal on
Monday.
   Private donations will cover the cost, the department said.
   The entire country has been hit by a severe drought and higher
than normal temperatures, and wild animals have been invading farms
in search of water. The northern Transvaal, in the northeastern
part of the country, is among the areas hardest hit. Forecasters
say no significant rainfall is expected soon.

   Braunberger entered the film industry in 1922 and two years
later became a producer of silent movies.
   He produced Renoir's first film, ``Catherine,'' and Bunuel's
first film, ``The Andalusian Dog,'' as well as works by such
renowned directors as Alain Resnais, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude
Berri. His most recent production was ``Knights of the Round
Table'' in 1989.
   In 1980, he received an honorary Cesar, the French equivalent of
the Oscars awarded in Hollywood.
   Braunberger married in 1964 and had two sons. Information about
funeral arrangements was not immediately released.

<HEAD>Last 100 Days Have Been Rough for Sudanese Junta</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Events of the last 100 days have cost
impoverished Sudan the support of Egypt, the United States and
wealthy gulf Arab countries. Basically all that's left are handouts
from Moammar Gadhafi's Libya.
   The isolation comes as it becomes increasingly likely Sudan will
face a famine that Western relief officials say could threaten up
to 11 million people.
   Sudan's troubles began when Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's
military government found itself on the other side of the Persian
Gulf crisis from its most important friends.
   Paying back old political and military debts, el-Bashir's junta
refused to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. That
alienated most of Khartoum's friends, who are demanding that Iraq
quit Kuwait.
   Traditionally, the Sudanese could rely on its big brother to the
north, Egypt, to bail it out of trouble. For two decades, food and
other aid from the United States and the West have kept the country
going through flood, famine and political turmoil.
   And Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the first now a bitter enemy and
the second an occupied country, had provided hundreds of millions
of dollars to help develop an agricultural potential once
considered the greatest in Africa.
   One of the junta's few allies since the invasion has been
Gadhafi, the Libyan strongman.
   He's promised to shore up Sudan's tottering Central Bank with
$100 million. He's sent 40,000 sacks of cement to restore schools
damaged by floods in 1988. He's pledged to build a system of paved
highways in Khartoum, a sprawling, dusty city of mainly dirt roads.
   Additionally, Col. Youssef Abdul Fatah, Khartoum's deputy
commissioner, said Libya donated ``10 huge electricity generators
to be used in emergencies and to help in pumping water to some of
the capital's districts.''
   Welcome as it is, such largesse does little to make up for the
loss of Western and Arab support.
   The invasion cost Sudan at least $2 billion in lost remittances
from 20,000 workers who were brought home from Iraq and Kuwait by
the Sudanese government.
   The minister of expatriate affairs, al-Saeed Osman Mahjoub, said
the repatriated people suffered at least $500 million in ``personal
losses'' like abandoned belongings in Kuwait and Iraq.
   And the junta's economics overseer, Col. Salah al-Deen Karar,
told the official Sudan News Agency the country is being ignored.
``We've notified international organizations of our losses and
demanded to be treated on an equal footing with countries
economically affected by the gulf crisis'' like Jordan and Egypt,
he said.
   But the world is proving unsympathetic to demands that Khartoum
be compensated for dislocations to the economy. The message is that
Sudan made an uncomfortable bed by siding with Iraq, but it will
have to lie in it.
   In October, Sudan invited Gadhafi as guest of honor at a
ceremony announcing the country's future system of government. Not
surprisingly, it resembles closely the Libyan ``jamahiriya'' based
on Gadhafi's theory that people should rule themselves through mass
meetings, not through elected representatives.
   The junta's debt to Gadhafi was so great that he was allowed to
suggest on national television, unchallenged, that ``religion
should be distanced from politics. ... If brought together they
spoil each other.''
   Sudan's basic law is the Islamic Sharia, a 1,400-year-old legal
and ethical code. And junta leader el-Bashir is a devout Moslem
with leanings toward the fundamentalist National Islamic Front,
although it like other political parties has been banned since his
coup on June 30, 1989.
   In the same speech, Gadhafi told the Sudanese a northeast
African merger of their country, Egypt and Libya could become a
great world power. He attacked the West for laughing at his ideas.
   During his October visit, Gadhafi also threatened to intervene
in Sudan's drawn-out and expensive southern civil war unless the
rebels stop fighting.
   The junta clings to the hope of a solution by force and last
month once again used the food weapon, bombing foodstocks to starve
the rebels. The decision drew criticism from the United States and
other governments who earlier ignored similar activities by both
sides.
   Possibly the decision hardest to explain is the junta's adamant
refusal to acknowledge that famine stalks the countryside again,
even after a governor in western Sudan declared his region a
disaster area.
   The denial instigated another fight with Washington and made
Western relief officials seethe. Without a government appeal,
famine relief cannot be organized.

<HEAD>CSCE Summit Will Launch New Era of European Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly united in a shared belief in
democracy, Europe is leaving behind the hostility of the Cold War
and embarking on what it hopes will be an era of peace and
prosperity.
   This week's summit in Paris of 34 nations - the United States,
Soviet Union, Canada and all of Europe except isolationist Albania
attending only as an observer - has been compared to the 1815
Congress of Vienna that drew the map of 19th century Europe.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas bills the meeting as ``the
most significant international event since 1945.''
   That year World War II ended, leaving Europe devastated and
millions dead. Iron Curtain division soon added to the destruction,
splitting the continent in half.
   For most of the next 40 years, communist East and capitalist
West locked in struggle to defend their ideals.
   One of the few institutions that brought the Soviet Union,
United States, Canada and Europe together was the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or CSCE, a loose grouping born
with the signing of the 1975 Helsinki human rights accord.
   Subsequent meetings in Belgrade, Madrid and Vienna strengthened
the human rights commitments and security provisions of that act,
spurring demands for freedom in Eastern Europe.
   It is fitting that it is the CSCE that will now seal the demise
of the Cold War and sketch the outlines of a new Europe governed by
trust in the rule of law and a free market.
   On Monday, the leaders of NATO and the six nations of the
crumbling Warsaw Pact will sign a historic accord slashing arsenals
of tanks, helicopters and other conventional weapons.
   New rules known as confidence-building measures will be adopted
to ensure that Europe's armies know more about each other than ever
before, reducing or even eliminating the danger of surprise attack.
   The two military alliances that armed Europe to the teeth for 40
years will also sign a formal non-aggression pact.
   To underline the shift from armed suspicion to dialogue, the
leaders will put CSCE proceedings on a more permanent footing by:
   - Agreeing that the heads of member states and governments meet
at least once every two years, their foreign ministers annually and
senior officials even more often.
   - Setting up a small secretariat in Prague, a center for the
prevention of conflict in Vienna and an office in Warsaw to help
monitor elections.
   For diplomats like John Maresca, U.S. ambassador to the
negotiations on confidence-building measures in Vienna, this marks
the end of a long road that began 18 years ago with the arduous
negotiation of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
   By enshrining human rights in a document signed by the Kremlin
and its allies, it provided Western governments and Soviet and East
European dissidents with a legal right to fight for more freedom in
the Soviet bloc.
   ``It contained the seeds of what happened last year'' with
Eastern Europe's revolutions, Maresca said.
   No one expected such sharp, sudden change, he said, but
``basically, that was the objective.''
   Now, some of the former dissidents, like Czechoslovak President
Vaclav Havel and Polish Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki, will be in
Paris to decide where CSCE should go from here in building a united
continent linked to North America and the Soviet Union.
   One idea, outlined in the landmark declaration that ended NATO's
London summit in July, is for an Assembly of Europe, a kind of CSCE
parliament.
   In three days of public speeches and a 90-minute closed-door
session allowing freer discussion, the leaders may decide to
encourage their parliaments to set up this European assembly.
   It is unlikely, however, that any such assembly - or other
possible measures, such as an alliance to alleviate the East's
energy woes - will prove an instant panacea for Europe's remaining
ills.
   The CSCE adopts all decisions by consensus, a mechanism Maresca
says serves to protect ``the essential interests'' of all members,
from the tiny Vatican and Luxembourg to the mighty superpowers.
   That means painstaking negotiation to overcome any rift.
   The United States and the European Community, who are supposed
to issue a declaration of alliance at the Paris summit, are sharply
divided over trade issues, with the Americans arguing the Europeans
must slash their massive farm subsidies.
   Nationalist tensions and economic woes compounded by the Persian
Gulf crisis threaten the fragile democracies of Eastern Europe,
whose economies are still dependent on supplies from the
increasingly fragmented Soviet Union.
   Some Western countries, most notably Britain, are still rent by
internal discord over policy toward Europe.
   The role of dominant Germany is also of concern. Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, Bonn's foreign minister since 1974, was, in the words of
a Bonn diplomat, ``one of the spiritual fathers of the CSCE
process.''
   Aware that CSCE offered a chance for German unity, Genscher
always gave the process the high profile it lacked, for example, in
the United States.
   In the days preceding the Paris summit, newly united Germany -
firmly anchored in NATO and the EC - signed accords with Moscow and
Poland that guaranteed its present borders but also underlined its
pivotal role as the partner of East and West.
   The Paris speech of Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be a test of how
Germany intends to wield its new might and live up to promises it
will now shoulder more global responsibilities.
   ``This special conference ... marks the final overcoming of the
East-West conflict,'' Kohl's spokesman Hans Klein said. ``It will
introduce a new epoch in European history.''

   Barbara Bush visited a primary
school in downtown Prague on Saturday, joking with children that
her dog Millie knows more about high matters of state than she
does.
   ``Millie sits in the National Security Council meetings every
morning,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``She probably knows more about the
Persian Gulf and Czechoslovakia than I do,'' she told a class of
11-and 12-year-olds studying English at a special school.
   Mrs. Bush, accompanying her husband on the first presidential
visit to Czechoslovakia, arrived at the school with Olga, the wife
of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.
   The 20 children treated them first to a traditional Czech folk
welcome gift of bread and salt, presented by two girls in
embroidered national costume.
   Then the children showed off their knowledge of English in a
small play that reflected the general air of expectation
surrounding the Bush visit to this central European nation.
   The performance featured a detective called Hot Dog who was
trying to find out why so many people had gathered around the
school. Eventually, his American counterpart, named Cool Cat, told
him it was because Mrs. Bush was coming.
   Mrs. Bush presented her book, including photographs of President
Bush playing with the dog in the White House's garden, and told the
children she loves working on her computer, gardening and reading.
   She also advised the children to go to the institute for
mentally handicapped children she visited earlier, saying that they
should go there to see ``how lucky you are.''
   The Institute for Social Care of Youth provides treatment for
126 mentally handicapped children.
   In a classroom of 10 severely handicapped boys, two staff
members helped youths to draw with colored pencils or water colors.
``Very nice, very nice,'' Mrs. Bush said as she examined the
artwork admiringly. Most of the boys communicated in noises, not
words.
   A 7-year-old boy named Michael, seeking attention from the first
lady, was invited to say hello. He sat on a translator's lap and
gave Mrs. Bush a kiss.
   Later, Mrs. Bush visited the historic Charles Bridge, the
graceful structure that connects Prague's two most beautiful
quarters either side of the Vltava River -- the Old Town, and the
Lesser Town.
   Olga Havel, dressed in a quiet black and red check two-piece,
again accompanied the American First Lady, together with a Prague
historian who explained the history of a statue of St. Barbara on
the bridge and some sights of the magnificent panorama around.
   ``I never thought I would be lucky enough to be here,'' Mrs.
Bush told waiting journalists.

<HEAD>Cleanup Seen Vital for Economy, as Well as Ecology</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pollution is so bad in Eastern Europe that it
is causing economic as well as environmental decay, an American
researcher said in a report Saturday.
   Rivers are so foul they can't be used for industrial cooling and
children become sickened by toxic chemicals in the air.
   Cleanup costs will be astronomical, and must be treated as an
essential part of the region's economic recovery, argues Hilary
French, a senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute.
   ``Given the degraded environment's toll on human health and
biological productivity, decontaminating Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union is best seen as a precondition to economic
development, not an obstacle,'' she writes.
   The study, ``Green Revolutions: Environmental Reconstruction in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,'' was published Saturday by
Worldwatch, a policy research organization based in Washington.
   Despite the report's catalog of horrors, it also voices optimism
that significant improvement should be possible.
   ``The emergence of a fairly strong environmental movement there
is certainly a very hopeful sign,'' Ms. French said in an
interview. ``And the problems are severe enough that it is widely
recognized that they'll have to be dealt with.''
   She cites estimates by East European economists that Poland is
losing 10 percent to 20 percent of its gross national product each
year to environmental degradation and Czechoslovakia 5 percent to 7
percent. The health costs of pollution in those and other countries
are also staggering, if difficult to pin down.
   ``Investments in environmental protection are thus virtually
guaranteed to provide economic benefits,'' she writes.
   The difficulty, naturally, will be finding money for the
environmental investments when other problems also cry out for
cash.
   Poland's environment minister estimates that environmental
projects could cost $20 billion over the next 10 to 20 years, and
Czech officials believe they may have to spend $23.7 billion for
pollution control over 15 years, according to the Worldwatch
report.
   Ms. French also cites an estimate of $249 billion to $308
billion as the cost of bringing the environment of the former East
Germany up to Western standards.
   ``Those numbers are imposing,'' she acknowledged. ``But that
amount of spending has economic benefits of its own.''
   The cleanup should create jobs, even as closing down hopelessly
dirty and inefficient factories throws thousands of people out of
work.
   In addition, the steps toward energy efficiency and waste
reduction that will improve the environment are also essential to
making the enterprises of what was the East Bloc globally
competitive.
   ``Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have a unique opportunity
to cull from 20 years of Western experience in addressing
environmental problems,'' Ms. French writes. ``They could
`leapfrog' the West in both policies and technologies.''
   In turn, the East European cleanup could provide new insights on
how to deal with West's worst pollution sites. Also, health
research in Eastern Europe is likely to provide more information
about hard-to-study links between human illness and toxic
substances in the air and water.
   ``The reports that have come out are still not very scientific
as far as associating effect with cause,'' Ms. French said. ``But
you don't want to talk about East Europe as a laboratory, when
there are human beings involved.''

<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
pleaded not guilty today on a charge of misconduct and accused her
successors of wrongdoing.
   ``I am innocent,'' Ms. Bhutto declared before a special court
trying one of seven corruption cases against her.
   In the case before the court today, the 37-year-old is accused
of approving the sale of 487 acres of federal land outside the
capital of Islamabad for a luxury hotel and resort. The land was
sold to a cousin of Ms. Bhutto's at rates far below market value,
prosecutors say.
   After a three-hour hearing today, Ms. Bhutto defended the sale
as a good decision because the capital had no facilities to house
visiting dignitaries.
   ``Even today, I believe this is a good project,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto faces six similar charges before other special
one-judge tribunals in Lahore and Karachi. Ms. Bhutto has
repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, claiming the cases are designed
force her out of politics.
   Conviction on any one of the charges could cost her seat in
Parliament and banish Ms. Bhutto from politics for as much as seven
years.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old
government Aug. 6 on charges of corruption, nepotism and abuse of
power.
   She was replaced by a caretaker government comprised of
opponents and former allies who filed corruption charges against
her as well as members of her family and former administration.
   Last month, Ms. Bhutto and her left-leaning Pakistan People's
Party were overwhelming defeated by the right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance led by her fiercest opponent, Pakistan's new
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.
   Ms. Bhutto today accused Ishaq Khan and Sharif of using their
influence obtain huge bank loans and then defaulting on repayment.
   ``Those who have defrauded billions of rupees have not been
taken before the special tribunals, while I who served the people
selflessly am forced to stand trial,'' she said.

   South Korea has retreated from some of the
democratic reforms it pledged prior to the 1988 Seoul Olympic
Games, the U.S.-based human rights organization Asia Watch says.
   Despite promises, South Korea ``continues to deny the
fundamental rights of workers, labor organizations, writers,
publishers, opposition leaders and others,'' Asia Watch said in a
100-page report released during the weekend.
   The report, titled ``Retreat from Reform,'' focused on curbs
against freedom of expression and worker rights. It said about half
of South Korea's more than 1,000 political prisoners are workers
and labor organizers.
   South Korean workers' desire for a larger share of the country's
new prosperity has become a source of major conflict with
government and industry leaders concerned that higher wages will
hurt competitiveness and economic growth.
   Asia Watch also criticized President George Bush's
administration for pursuing South Korean human rights issues
through ``quiet diplomacy'' rather than publicly condemning abuses.
This approach undermined the stated U.S. policy of encouraging
democratization, it said.
   Bush should have spoken out on human rights at his White House
meeting with President Roh Tae-woo last June, Asia Watch said,
describing this as one of several lost opportunities.
   ``Retreat from Reform'' described South Korea's National
Security Law as vaguely-worded and ``draconian.'' It urged revision
of the law to ease curbs on dissent and free expression, with
release of those detained for peaceful activity.
   Asia Watch accused the Roh government of a contradictory policy
in promoting normalization and eventual unification with communist
North Korea while punishing private citizens for advocating
unification or making contacts with the north. This was described
as ``an unacceptable limit on freedom of expression.''
   South Korean labor laws and practices fell short of
International Labor Organization standards of free bargaining and
association, the report said, describing crackdowns on union
activity in the Hyundai industrial group, the broadcasting and
publishing industries and among public and private schoolteachers.
   Asia Watch is affiliated with Human Rights Watch, Helsinki Watch
and other organizations that monitor rights set forth in the 1975
Helsinki East-West agreement.
   The organization also released a statement from the South Korean
Justice Ministry branding ``Retreat from Reform'' as ``biased
judgment.''
   The ministry said Asia Watch ``heeded only the one-sided and
superficial allegations by the lawbreakers'' who have perpetrated
violent demonstrations and subversive activities ``inan attempt to
overthrow the free and democratic system of the nation.''
   It said the government makes ``utmost efforts to ensure due
process of law'' and criticized ``misguided tendencies among some
to falsely eulogize lawbreakers as `political prisoners' or
`prisoners of conscience'.''

<TEXT>
   Three rival armies have raped,
looted and pillaged Liberia for 11 months, and there seems to be no
end to the brutal civil war.
   An estimated 10,000 civilians have been killed and more than
half the nation's 2.3 million people are refugees.
   Soldiers sent by five other West African countries to stop the
fighting are using both bombs and propaganda leaflets in an attempt
to persuade rebel leader Charles Taylor to end the war he started.
   It began Dec. 24, when Taylor led his rebels into Liberia from
neighboring Ivory Coast to oust the government of President Samuel
Doe, who was accused of corruption, human rights abuses and violent
repression.
   Thousands of peasants, including children as young as 8, joined
Taylor and overran most of the country.
   A dissident faction that broke with Taylor's National Patriotic
Front captured Doe and tortured him to death in September. Then the
8,000-member West African force moved in with tanks and planes,
drove Taylor's forces out of eastern Monrovia and stopped fighting
in the capital.
   A Nigerian newspaper, the Lagos Guardian, said today the West
African force had surrounded the rebel-held port of Buchanan and
expected to take it within a week.
   After the West Africans reopened Monrovia's Spriggs Payne
Airfield to helicopters and light aircraft this month, some members
of an interim government were flown in. Taylor has his own
administration in the interior and rejected the interim government,
chosen by exiled Liberians.
   Amos Sawyer, a veteran leftist opposition leader who is
president of the interim government, was shuttling among West
African capitals last week in pursuit of a cease-fire.
   The other warring parties - the Liberian army and rebels led by
Prince Johnson - have said they welcome the interim government and
its mandate to organize fair elections.
   Interim government spokesman Edward Dunn said, however, that
Johnson sent a letter threatening some of the ministers. Dunn, the
government protocol officer, said Johnson warned some to stay away
from Monrovia, including Baccus Matthews, the interim foreign
minister, and Gbai Bala, a former adviser to Doe.
   Hundreds of Liberians have gathered on the docks of Freetown,
Sierra Leone, hoping to follow the interim government home,
apparently preferring the hardships of Monrovia to refugee camps
where food also is scarce.
   President Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone has said his government
would not accept any more Liberian refugees unless more
international aid was provided to take care of them.
   Two weeks ago, Momoh rejected a request sent through the U.S.
Embassy that 160 children orphaned by the war be allowed into
Sierra Leone. He also said the United States was not doing enough
to help refugees despite its historic ties with Liberia.
   Freed American salves founded Liberia in 1847. They subjugated
the natives and their descendants dominated the country until 1980,
when Doe seized power in a coup.
   Africa Watch, an American human rights group, said in a report
Oct. 26: ``Because past U.S. support for Doe played a major role in
the destruction of the country today, the Bush administration has
an important responsibility to do more to assist the victims of the
conflict.''
   ``All parties to the conflict have committed grave abuses of
human rights against civilians,'' it said, and criticized the West
African army for bombing raids that, according to survivors, have
killed hundreds of civilians.
   The report criticized the multinational army for accepting into
its ranks members of the Doe army and Johnson forces who agreed to
a cease-fire in the civil war.
   European relief workers reported this month that food
distribution had to be suspended temporarily in Monrovia, where
hundreds of people have died of starvation, because army soldiers
were stealing food from civilians.
   Since then, the West Africans have tried to talk the soldiers
back into their barracks and the nearby presidential mansion, where
they had been trapped by Johnson's forces.
   Some rebels continue to desert. West African leaflets dropped
from planes urge them to give up ``this useless war.'' Taylor's
radio station has broadcast orders that no fighters leave the front
without written permission.
   The Ivory Coast, already sheltering thousands of Gio and Mano
tribespeople who were the targets of Doe's soldiers, also has
become a refuge for civilians of Doe's Krahn tribe.
   In its report, Africa Watch said Krahns were fleeing Grand Gedeh
County, a Krahn stronghold on the Ivory Coast border, at a rate of
1,000 a day.
   Those who cross the border tell horror stories.
   ``I saw them kill a mother and her 3-year-old twins, and two
others,'' a refugee teacher said. ``My two brothers are missing,
and three other members of my family. I don't know where they are
because we fled in all directions when the rebels attacked. So many
people died that you don't have enough paper to write down all
their names.''

<HEAD>Iraqi General Warns West Would Face Toughter Fight Than It Thinks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER C. PUTNAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Iraqi general said Saturday that
U.S.-led military forces would face ``uncalculated developments''
that would thwart any attack they launched to dislodge Iraq from
Kuwait.
   The warning came from Maj. Gen. Mundhir Abdul-Rahman, a missile
expert and head of the Iraqi army's morale and guidance department.
   But it was difficult to determine whether the general was
speaking in his capacity as a specialist in long-range weaponry -
or as chief military morale booster.
   Writing in Al-Qadissiya, the army's daily newspaper,
Abdul-Rahman questioned the value of Western air superiority if the
aim was to take Iraqi territory.
   He said his country was prepared to defend itself despite plans
to increase U.S. troop strength. U.S. officials announced earlier
this month that another 200,000 U.S. troops would join the 230,000
Americans already deployed in the region.
   Britain's Independent newspaper reported Saturday that Iraq is
believed to have assembled three so-called ``superguns'' able to
fire shells a distance of more than 450 miles.
   U.S. intelligence sources believe the guns, largely assembled
from British-made components, may have been delivered to Iraq
before production of these exotic weapons was discovered earlier
this year.
   In his article, Abdul-Rahman wrote: ``The surprise element by
Iraq will make the American aggression face uncalculated
developments and unexpected results in (Iraq's) reaction, which
would make their execution of aggression according to its plans
impossible.''
   Iraq could come up with a military surprise that would not allow
U.S.-led forces to ``manage the crisis the way they like,''
Abdul-Rahman said.
   The latest announced increase in American troop strength will
raise the U.S. forces in the region to 430,000 soldiers, Marines,
airmen and sailors - believed to be about equivalent to the number
of Iraqi forces in Kuwait and their strategic reserve in southern
Iraq.
   President Bush said the extra forces were was needed in case it
became necessary to launch a military strike to dislodge Iraq from
Kuwait. Iraq overran the emirate on Aug. 2.
   Abdul-Rahman questioned the idea of a surgical air strike by the
U.S.-led forces. Military experts say Western air power is
technologically superior to Iraq's air strength of around 500-plus
comat jets.
   The combined air power of the United States, Britain, France and
their allies in the gulf region now totals more than 1,000 fighters
and attack aircraft.
   ``Never in the past was the Air Force able to end war,''
Abdul-Rahman stressed, a point on which many western analysts
agree.
   Abdul-Rahman said the balance in ground forces was in Iraq's
favor with ``numerical superiority, war-tested experience'' and
support weaponry.
   ``When the American administration launches its aggression,
whether now or in the near future, it will go into a war with a
position which has been made late and wrong in its strategic
calculations.
   ``It will not be useful to send more troops to join the military
buildup in the area to reverse that position,'' the general said.
   Iraqi officials have said that the underlying reason for the
Western presence in the region was to try to knock President Saddam
Hussein from power.
   They said the Western powers fear Iraq is becoming a military
counterweight to Israel in the Middle East and that they want to
dominate the region's oil resources.
   Before leaving Washington Friday on a tour that will take him to
Europe and the Middle East, Bush said there is ``a ticking of the
clock'' on the Gulf crisis.
   Al-Qadissiya was not the only Iraqi newspaper to advise the
anti-Iraq alliance against military action.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported
the government-run daily, Al-Jumhuriya, warned Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to ``stop using direct and
indirect threats, assuring that Iraq possesses a lot of
surprises.''
   If there are such surprises in store, U.S. officials seem bent
on uncovering them. Astronauts on a secret space shuttle mission on
Friday deployed a surveillance satellite, according to sources at
the U.S. space center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   Published reports have said the spacecraft will either eavesdrop
on communications in the gulf or conduct photo surveys of Iraq and
Kuwait. The satellite would be the latest in a fleet.
   At least 12 other reconnaisance, electronic surveillance,
early-warning, meteorlogical and navigation satellites already
relay data 24 hours a day. They include systems that can spot tank
tracks in the desert and others that can give B-52 bombers greater
accuracy.

   Where's the beef? The Wolf burger
makes its desert debut Sunday bringing a tasty morsel of Americana
to front-line troops who are fed up with prepackaged Army chow.
   It may not come from the golden arches, or be a Whopper oozing
with onions and catsup, but it's free.
   And so are the french fries, sodas, hot dogs and grilled cheese
sandwiches that will be cooked on the U.S. military's version of a
traveling fast-food stand - the Wolfmobile.
   It was the brainchild of Chief Warrant Officer Wes Wolf, 42, of
Monterey, Calif., who dreamed up the idea in the middle of
organizing Thanksgiving dinner for most of the 230,000 Americans in
Operation Desert Shield.
   Maj. Gen. William ``Gus'' Pagonis, the U.S. Army's logistics
chief, gave Wolf's name to the food-mobile, the military's treat
for the GI fast-food junkie stranded in the sand dunes and
surviving on cold rations, hot TV-style dinners and an occasional
hot cooked meal.
   ``We have a generation of soldiers including myself that grew up
on hamburgers and french fries, and so we're going to provide
that,'' Pagonis said. ``Out in the desert, you're going to see
these Wolfmobiles.''
   The first Wolfmobile left Friday for the 1st Cavalry Division
camped in the desert in eastern Saudi Arabia and the two Army cooks
manning it will start grilling Wolfburgers and hot dogs on Sunday.
   Wolf said 80 Wolfmobile trucks were being dispatched to the
desert, where they would move among the front-line units.
   Even if the Wolfmobiles can't get to every forward unit, Pagonis
said, at least ``when the soldiers come back to their base camp
they can get french fries and a hamburger.''
   Much of the griping from Americans deployed here following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 has focused on food, and the
complaints have been loudest from front-line units forced to eat
more prepackaged combat rations.
   ``Gen. Pagonis insists that the soldiers in the desert receive
the same quality food that we're giving to the soldiers back here
in the rear,'' Wolf said. ``He doesn't care what is forward as far
as equipment ... and he's very, very concerned about that.''
   Short-order food is more popular than regular hot meals at Army
bases in the states. So Wolf and Pagonis first decided to open a
fast-food dining facility.
   It's called The Pentagon and is open nightly, serving pizza, hot
dogs, hamburgers and chili, but it's only available to soldiers in
rear-line units.
   Then it was time to take care of the soldiers in the desert.
   ``That's when we came up with the idea of a mobile-type truck,''
Wolf said. ``We thought, well there's no reason that we can't ...
put a couple of military cooks in there, get the supplies from the
Saudi government. Then, the soldiers can just walk up and order a
hamburger, fries and a soda and just walk away without paying for
it.''
   Saudi Arabia is supplying all food for the U.S. forces here
under an agreement with the United States.
   The Wolfmobile is a 30-foot-long, two-ton truck with a fold-out
window and a ramp to walk up and order food. It's equipped with a
Franklin stove, grills, a deep-fat fryer, freezer, refrigerator, a
grilled-cheese maker and eight heat lamps to keep the food warm.
   Each truck can feed between 500 and 800 soldiers before it needs
to be resupplied.
   Even though Wolf isn't planning to retire from the army yet, the
rangy soldier likes the idea of franchising Wolf burgers some day.
   And he's already got the slogan: ``A burger on every bayonet.''

   Iraq is grappling with a ``deadly serious''
shortage of drugs and other medical supplies as the result of U.N.
sanctions against the Baghdad government, the health minister said
Saturday.
   Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Sa'eed also said the country is
also running out of milk for babies, and complained that many
countries had refused to send supplies ordered before the embargo
was imposed.
   The sanctions were approved as part of an international effort
to force Iraq out of Kuwait after its Aug. 2 invasion. But they
exempt ``supplies intended strictly for medical purposes.''
   Sa'eed accused Turkey, Iraq's northern neighbor, of preventing
large quantities of medicine and milk from reaching Iraq. He
provided no details.
   ``It is deadly serious, and as the minister of health, I think
it is not only inhumane but also criminal to deprive my people from
medicine and other medical supplies,'' Sa'eed said at a Baghdad
news conference.
   He said Iraqis have been most affected by shortages of medicines
with short shelf lives, plus vaccines and milk for infants. He
cited a severe shortage of antibiotics and medicine for people with
heart problems and diabetes.
   The minister said some newborns receive only 3 pounds of food a
month, compared with a minimum standard of 10 pounds. He said he
feared some were already suffering ill effects.
   ``I'm really worried about our children. They might not be able
to receive a sufficient amount of nutrition,'' he said.
   He said polio posed a threat to children's health because of the
lack of vaccines.
   The health minister was also critical of the chairman of the
U.N. committee that supervises that embargo for reporting that Iraq
had medical supplies that could last 10 years.
   The chairman, Marjatta Rasi of Finland, ``should be better
informed about the needs of newborn children, but I'm afraid that
her statement was not only childish but irresponsible,'' Sa'eed
said.
   Rasi said earlier this month she feared that Iraq could make
biological or chemical weapons from components of some medicines
that had been supplied under embargo exemptions. Iraq denied that.
   She said some experts believed certain medical supplies could
last 10 years. Iraq produces some of its own antibiotics,
painkillers and other simple drugs.
   But the health minister said: ``Our industry is a really small
one.''
   Painkillers, cold medicine and other such drugs have been scarce
in Baghdad pharmacies since the first days of the embargo, when
some people began hoarding.
   The government has been encouraging research of herbal
medicines, as well as their practical use by health professionals.

   Yevgeny and Julia Loukyanov, late of
Moscow, spend their days looking in shop windows at things they
can't afford or sitting in a crowded refugee center, wondering what
the future holds.
   ``We can't work because we can't get work papers,'' said Julia,
25, ``but the worst thing is, after all this we'll probably be
kicked out of the country.''
   The young Russian couple are part of Europe's greatest refugee
migration since World War II. It became a tide sweeping from east
to west after the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc collapsed a
year ago.
   When the first thousands came, seeking better lives in a more
secure future, citizens of the western democracies cheered,
embraced them and offered gifts.
   But they came in millions, had to be housed and fed, and took
jobs westerners felt were rightfully theirs. Welcome began turning
to resentment. West Germany committed billions of dollars of public
money to the economic derelict that was East Germany for 40 years
until reunification.
   A combination of the westward flow of Europeans and a huge
migration from Third World countries has increased racial and
ethnic tensions, created severe housing shortages and caused social
welfare costs to balloon.
   Now the Soviet Union may be on the point of disintegration,
which could add 15 million more refugees to the flood.
   ``The Soviets themselves have been mentioning anything from 2
million to 15 million,'' said Jonas Widgren, an asylum consultant
at the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva.
   Economic conditions are getting worse in the Eastern European
countries, which means the number of people heading west is likely
to grow.
   ``The year 1991 will be the worst year economically for ...
Eastern Europe since World War II,'' said Heinrich Machowski, an
expert on East bloc affairs at the German Institute for Economic
Research in Berlin.
   Nearly 2 million people have sought asylum in 10 western
European nations since 1983 and millions more have immigrated
illegally.
   According to U.N. statistics, the number seeking asylum in the
10 countries soared from 61,100 in 1983 to 300,500 last year.
   Nearly 400,000 more are expected by the end of this year, plus
about 1 million ethnic Germans who have automatic German
citizenship.
   In addition to East Europeans, the newcomers include refugees
from such countries as Lebanon, Iran, Sudan, Tunisia, Algeria,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
   ``I left Sudan because I was put in prison for my political
views,'' said Ahmed Alseed Gasm, 27, another refugee at the Bonn
shelter. ``I need that (residence) permit because I can't go back
home.''
   West European nations are tightening immigration laws and
cracking down on illegal immigrants, but that has not stemmed the
flow.
   Public resentment is turning to violence.
   In Florence, Italy, earlier this year, masked youths assaulted
African street vendors with baseball bats.
   Rock-throwing German youths have attacked tent cities set up by
Romanian gypsies.
   Some parents in a German town refused to send their children to
a school whose gymnasium had been a temporary shelter for gypsies.
They expressed fear their children would catch diseases or be
infested with lice.
   Gypsies fleeing ethnic troubles in their home countries are seen
on German streets in growing numbers. Several hundred camped out in
trailers at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate until police ordered them to
leave.
   Gangs of young German ``skinheads'' frequently attack Turks,
Vietnamese and other foreigners.
   In Paris, African immigrants were the targets of an
anti-squatter eviction campaign. For weeks afterward, several dozen
former squatters lived in makeshift tents at a corner of Sacre
Coeur basilica.
   Austria, which was the neutral bridge between East and West for
decades, sent soldiers to stop Romanian refugees ariving via
Hungry. The Freedom Party nearly doubled its parliamentary seats in
this fall's elections, partially on the strengths of its
anti-immigration stands.
   Germany's wealth, proximity to the former East bloc and history
of generosity to refugees has made it a prime destination.
   It expects asylum-seekers to total nearly 200,000 this year,
plus the ethnic Germans from former Soviet bloc countries.
   Officials said Friday they will assign 20 percent of all
asylum-seekers to the formerly Communist east starting in December.
   Refugee centers are overflowing. Army barracks, empty warehouses
and rented boats on the Rhine are used as emergency shelters.
   Yevgeny and Julia Loukyanov left Moscow in October, fleeing a
nation they feel is about to come apart.
   Social welfare is paying their expenses at the Bonn refugee
shelter until a decision is made on their application for asylum.
   Officials indicate they have little chance of acceptance because
the end of the Cold War removed most reasons for granting asylum to
Soviet citizens.

<HEAD>Whatever the Outcome, Case Is Important Ethics Watershed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Are the ``Keating Five'' senators victims of a
flawed system, or cynical cash-grabbers who championed the dubious
cause of one jet-set constituent at the expense of everyone else in
the country?
   What is being examined in their Senate ethics hearing: the way
the entire institution operates or the conduct of five members?
   And how did a Senate leader, two national heroes, a former
prosecutor and a man who arrived 23 years ago as a reformer come to
this pass?
   ``It would be hard for it not to be a landmark case,'' associate
Senate historian Donald Ritchie said of the tale unfolding before
the Senate Ethics Committee. ``Whatever comes out will affect the
way business is done. They'll all have to look at themselves. It
will be an important precedent for how to judge the behavior of
other people in the future.''
   There are long days of witnesses and cross-examination to come,
including an opening statement from Arizona Democratic Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, who did not have time to speak Friday. But Robert
Bennett, the ethics committee's blunt special counsel, already has
presented his star witness: four tall stacks of paper.
   Paper, he said, is the only reliable source of information on
the web of contributions and favors linking the five senators to
Charles H. Keating Jr. and his zealous attempts to thwart the
federal regulators closing in on his failing Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association.
   ``Paper doesn't suffer from human emotion or frailties, nor does
it change with time,'' Bennett said. ``Paper doesn't have faulty
recollections. ... It's highly credible, this paper.''
   Bennett said the tens of thousands of documents his staff had
examined showed no evidence of misconduct by Sens. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz. - the first a former astronaut,
the second a former Vietnam prisoner of war.
   But he also implied that Democratic Sen. Don Riegle - the
Michigan veteran and one-time rebel who now chairs the Senate
Banking Committee - was not being straightforward about his role.
And he suggested that DeConcini, a former prosecutor, and Senate
Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California crossed an ethical line
in their dealings with Keating.
   Glenn, McCain, Riegle and Cranston denied any wrongdoing before
the committee Friday, and DeConcini is expected to do the same this
week.
   Much of the future testimony will center on the existence and
location of that line under a system in which names on the
contribution list inevitably turn up among those requesting help.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., a member of the ethics panel, has
already argued that ``the committee cannot act on the basis of
laws, rules and standards that some people might like to see. ...
The committee must use the standards that are in place.''
   But Bennett and some on the panel said former Illinois Sen. Paul
Douglas had developed guiding principles that are now well
established. Make sure a constituent's cause has merit, Douglas
wrote in a book on the subject. Allow a decent interval of time
between a contribution and a favor, and don't try to bully or
intimidate officials.
   Ritchie agrees that there is an ethical line, but he says it
keeps moving and is easy to cross unwittingly.
   ``Much of what people consider unethical today was ethical in
the past,'' the historian said. ``Daniel Webster argued cases
before the Supreme Court for a fee while he was a senator. Senators
used to take retainers from large corporations. ... In the late
19th century it was considered legitimate for Washington newspaper
correspondents to serve as clerks of committees of Congress while
writing for the paper.''
   The Keating case concerns a timeless issue, influence peddling.
But Ritchie said its scope - involving five senators - is
unprecedented.
   The only comparable case occurred more than 100 years ago, he
said, when two House committees and one in the Senate uncovered a
bribery scheme meant to head off a congressional investigation of
railroad transportation rates.
   Rep. Oakes Ames was accused of using undervalued railroad stock
to bribe the vice president, two senators and three House members -
including the speaker and Rep. James Garfield, who never cleared up
his connection but later became president.
   When asked how he had decided who would get the stock, Ames
replied that he ``gave it where it would do the best,'' Ritchie
said.
   The Keating case has taken on even broader significance in view
of the collapse of the S&amp;L industry, which could cost U.S.
taxpayers up to $500 billion. Part of that is the $2 billion
Lincoln failure, for which Keating now faces criminal and civil
charges.
   Ritchie compared the Keating hearings to a congressional
investigation into the 1929 Wall Street crash. He said that inquiry
laid bare the banking industry's abuses and gave the public some
sense of who was responsible for the crash.
   ``If Keating were the only banker in the country who had
problems, it would be different. But he's symbolic of a much larger
problem,'' Ritchie said.
   Bennett made clear he does not believe the ``Keating Five''
should be blamed for the S&amp;L mess. But he did say it would be fair
to ask if they had thought carefully about what would happen if
Keating got what he wanted.
   The senators had other constituents, he said, among them the
depositors who lost their savings and the U.S. taxpayers who will
foot the Lincoln bailout bill. ``Who was listening to their
concerns when the meetings and phone calls to regulators were
occurring?'' he asked.
   Bennett was billed as a fact-finder, but often sounded so
prosecutorial that he brought protests from senators both on and
off the ethics committee. ``You asked me to call it the way it
was,'' he said at one point. ``And I'm going to do that.''
   There were those who liked his calls and those who didn't.
   McCain emerged from Day One letting out a long, loud breath of
relief, and Glenn lauded Bennett for doing a fine job. Cranston
snubbed the whole affair, watching it on TV in his office, until it
was his turn to speak Friday. Riegle shook with anger and tension
during comments to reporters, and DeConcini fought to restrain
himself.
   ``I don't think anybody would contend that this is a fair
process,'' DeConcini said tersely. ``I didn't create this world. I
just happen to live in it.''

<TEXT>
   Following is the transcript of an
address delivered by President Bush on Saturday at Wenceslas
Square:
   Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, my Czech and Slovak
friends.
   It is a tremendous honor to me to be the first sitting American
president to visit this proud and beautiful country, and to be able
to join you on the first anniversary of the extraordinary Velvet
Revolution. What a powerfully moving sight it is.
   There are no leaves on the trees, but it is Prague spring.
   There are no flowers in bloom, and yet it is Prague spring. The
calendar says November 17, and yet it is Prague spring.
   Your declaration of independence claims the forces of darkness
have served the victory of light; the longed-for age of humanity is
dawning. Today, the freedom-loving people of the world can bear
witness that this age of humanity has now finally and truly dawned
on this splendid nation.
   Seven decades ago, an unprecedented partnership began between
two presidents, the philosopher Tomas Masaryk and the idealistic
scholar, Woodrow Wilson. It was a partnership as well among Czechs
and Slovaks to join together in federation. And yes, it was a long,
hard road, from their work on your declaration of independence to
this magnificent celebration today.
   I am proud to walk these last steps with you as one shared
journey ends and another begins.
   Our countries share a history. We share a vision. And we share a
friendship, a friendship Masaryk described to Czech-American
soldiers 70 years ago. He said, ``Do not forget that the same
ideals, the same principles ever unite us. Do not forget us, as we
shall never forget you.'' And that is why I'm here today - we have
not forgotten. And the world will never forget what happened here,
in this square where the history of freedom was written. The days
of anguish, the days of hope. So many times you came here bearing
candles against the dark night, answering the call of Comenius to
follow the way of light. These brave flames came to symbolize your
fiercely burning national pride.
   A year ago the world saw you face down totalitarianism. We saw
the peaceful crowd swell day by day in numbers and in resolve. And
we saw the few candles grow into a blaze. And we saw the square
become a beacon of hope for an entire nation, as it gave birth to
your new era of freedom.
   This victory owes its heart to two great heroes: Alexander
Dubcek - 22 years ago he led this nation in its first sweet taste
of liberty. His are the will and compassion that are the living
Czechoslovakia. And then President Havel, a man of wisdom, a man of
tremendous moral courage.
   In the dark years on one side sat the state, on the other side
Havel; one side tyranny, on the other this man of vision and truth.
   Among the first was Havel, and now there are millions. Today a
Europe whole and free is within our reach. We've seen a new world
of freedom born amidst shouts of joy, born full of hope, barreling
with confidence toward a new century, a new world born of a
revolution that linked this square with others - Gdansk, Budapest,
Berlin - a revolution that joined together people fueled by courage
and by humanity's essential quest for freedom.
   And for four decades, our two nations waited across the divide
between East and West, two peoples united in spirit and vision, and
yet separated by conflict. Today the United States and
Czechoslovakia stand together, united once more in our devotion to
the democratic ideal. And now with the division of Europe ending
and democracy ascending in the East, the challenge is to move
forward.
   In Czechoslovakia, from revolution to renaissance, across this
continent toward a new Europe, in which each nation and every
culture can flourish and breathe free. On both sides of the
Atlantic, toward a commonwealth of freedom based on our shared
principles and our hopes for the whole world, a commonwealth
inspired by the words of your great Comenius, written three
centuries ago, ``Let us have but one end in view, the welfare of
humanity.''
   A thousand miles to the south, this new commonwealth of freedom
now faces a terrible test. Czechoslovakia was one of the first
nations to condemn the outrage in the Persian Gulf, one of the
first to measure the magnitude of the wrong committed in the name
of territorial ambition.
   It is no coincidence that appeasement's lonely victim half a
century ago should be among the first to understand that there is
right and there is wrong, there is good and there is evil, and
there are sacrifices worth making.
   There is no question about what binds our nations and so many
others in common cause. There is no question that ours is a just
cause and that good will - that good will prevail, that darkness is
the - in the desert sky cannot stand against the way of light.
   I salute your courageous President when he joins us in saying
that Saddam Hussein's aggression must not be rewarded.
   Earlier today, I told your Parliament, ``We know this is a
difficult time for you, but also a time of extraordinary
optimism.''
   As you undertake political and economic reform, know one thing.
   America will not fail you in this decisive moment. America will
stand with you. We will continue along the road mapped out by our
Presidents more than 70 years ago, a road whose goal was described
by Woodrow Wilson, ``to bring peace and safety to all nations and
make the world itself at last free.'' For the past 70 years, your
Declaration of Independence has been preserved and cherished in our
Library of Congress. I say it is time for Masaryk's words to come
home. And as humanity and liberty return to Czechoslovakia, so too
will this treasured document.
   On behalf of the people of the United States, I am proud to be
able to tell the people of Czechoslovakia, 1989 was the year that
freedom came home to Czechoslovakia. 1990 will be the year your
Declaration of Independence came home to the golden city of Prague.
May it be, for future generations, a reminder of the ties that bind
our nations, and the principles that bind all humanity.
   In 1776, when our declaration of independence was first read in
public, a bell tolled to proclaim the defiant thrill of that
moment.
   That bell - we call it at home the Liberty Bell - has for 200
years symbolized out nation's deepest dedication to freedom,
dedication like your own. Inscribed on this bell are the words,
``Proclaim liberty throughout all the land.'' We want to help you
proclaim your new liberty throughout all this proud and beautiful
land, and so today we give to you our last replica of the Liberty
Bell.
   You know, one of our patriotic songs proclaims ``Sweet land of
liberty - from every mountainside, let freedom ring.'' And so when
bells ring in Wenceslas Square or in Bratislava or anywhere in this
glorious country, think of this bell and know that all bells are
tolling for your precious liberty, now and forever.
   And so now I am proud to ring this bell three times - once for
your courage, once for your freedom, and once for your children.
   May God bless Czechoslovakia. Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech to the Supreme Soviet today, as translated by
The Associated Press:
   Comrades, addresses made at yesterday's session of people's
deputies by members of the Supreme Soviet, representatives of
republics, my talks with other comrades during the session show
that a (general) opinion has formed that the Union Treaty should be
moved ahead faster.
   But even before that, strong radical measures are needed to
improve the situation in the country as far as the political and
economic stability is concerned, as well as public law and order,
discipline, and normalization of inter-ethnic relations. It is my
understanding that the comrades think that an urgent reform and
strengthening of the state power structure is the major priority.
   In this connection I propose the following:
   First, to vest qualitatively new powers into the Federation
Council. It should be transformed from an advisory body into an
effective structure to coordinate the efforts of the center and the
republics. I will emphasize this: anything affecting the entire
country, whether decided by the center or republics, must be
discussed and given the go-ahead by the Federation Council. A
mutually acceptable basis for a decision is to be worked out there.
Its work must be done on a regular basis, be open to the society.
The inter-republican committee can become the working organ of the
Federation Council. Highly qualified experts and specialists with
powers to represent republics would work in it on a permanent
basis.
   Second, in this case, to dissolve the Presidential Council and
establish a National Security Council. To launch without delay a
radical reorganization of the central executive (branch of) power,
subordinate it to the president and introduce changes of the
structure and personnel, remove outdated structures, form new ones.
I will not name them all, but I have mentioned most of them. New
people of initiative, capable of innovative thinking, should be
brought into the Cabinet. The issue of a vice-presidency obviously
needs to be resolved. Concurrent decisions have to be made to
ensure efficient operation of governments at local level. All this
must be done without delay, without waiting for a Union Treaty, as
I have been urging all along. But I understand that you have
brought here all concerns, all the feelings of the society. Taking
all this into account, we must act and solve everything in the
Supreme Soviet as the situation demands, even before the Congress
of People's Deputies (convenes).
   Third, justified demands are being voiced to consolidate law and
order, guarantee the safety of each citizen of our country. Urgent
changes of structure and personnel, both in the center, republics
and at local level, are called for. And something else: we must do
our best to prevent global and general intervention into the
activities of law enforcement organs that is practically paralyzing
now their operation. There are laws adopted here by ourselves, and
if we have any self-respect, we ought to allow them to work.
(Applause). I propose to form within the framework of presidential
power an organ to coordinate the activities of law enforcement
agencies to combat organized crime, shadow economy, profiteering
and other manifestations of criminal activities that are sweeping
the country What I have in mind is a special service reporting to
the president. We would invite energetic and highly skilled
professionals. This question has been worked out, and the new organ
can start work in 10 to 12 days. A chamber of control must be
established for the president with authorized representatives in
all regions to ensure implementation of laws, decisions and
directives.
   Fourth, on food, I will repeat that resources are not less than
last year, it is basically a matter of regularizing the system of
supplying the population with products they need, of how accurate
regions and republic are in meeting their obligations. Besides, we
need to take stock of what we have and control it well. I have
issued a directive that a list of urgent measures for supplying
this year's produce to the population be worked out urgently and
submitted in the next 10 days - two weeks, at the most - for
consideration, or at least for your information.
   Fifth, specifically on measures to ensure the viability of the
country. Here I give priority to railway transport and power
industry. I am appealing to all soviets, executive and government
organs to do all possible to ensure uninterrupted work of these
important industries, not to allow any disruptions in moving
freight, or any time lost unnecessarily to load and unload railway
cars. All operational measures to achieve it - and we have a lot of
experience -will be justified.

   He performed in places like Madison Square
Garden more times than Frank Sinatra, Jack Dempsey and lots of
other big names.
   But after 11,697 shows, animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams
performs his last death-defying act Sunday with the Ringling Bros.
and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.
   ``Everybody asks me, `Why now?''' he said in the thick German
accent he hasn't lost since he came to the United States 22 years
ago. ``I want to step down when I am really good. I don't want to
be like Ali, Sugar Ray, `Another fight, another fight.' ''
   A U.S. citizen since 1979, he calls himself ``German-engineered
but a proud American'' and often sports a cowboy hat and a
Western-style shirt. Though he's 56, Gebel-Williams remains
enviably trim, 141 pounds with a ruddy complexion and his trademark
sweep of blond hair.
   He announced two years ago that he would retire from ``The
Greatest Show on Earth'' at the end of the 1990 season. He plans to
settle at his winter home in Venice, Fla., with his 20 Bengal and
Siberian tigers.
   After 42 years on the road, he said, training 20 tigers is
getting a little riskier because he has lost some of his quickness
and his eyesight is not what it used to be.
   And glasses wouldn't look so hot with his skin-hugging tights
and sequined boleros, he joked.
   ``When you have 20 tigers, it's not easy to act like nothing can
happen,'' he said. ``I've been like their father, their brother.
I've been in charge always. But when one tiger is hurt, they always
blame me.''
   His domination in the ring comes from a soft-spoken training
method based on mutual respect that separates him from his
chair-and whip-wielding predecessors like Clyde Beatty and Mabel
Stark, who taught animals to fear them.
   Gebel-Williams strokes his elephants' trunks, pats the tigers
and mumbles commands in German, Indian or English. He welcomes
animal rights advocates to attend his training sessions.
   ``That's the difference between me and everybody else,'' he
said. ``I did everything with open doors.
   ``In 21 years never did somebody say I treated an animal
wrong.''
   Gebel-Williams began his career when he joined Circus Williams
in Germany as an usher at 12. He became so much a part of the
Williams family, who had hired his mother as a seamstress, that he
added their name to his. By the 1960s, he was well-known as one of
Europe's top animal trainers.
   In 1968, he caught the eye of Irvin Feld, owner and producer of
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, who bought the entire
Circus Williams to get their star to come to America.
   Now Gebel-Williams will yield the ring to his 20-year-old son,
Mark. But he won't yield the tigers because he's afraid they won't
transfer their devotion to his son.
   Mark's act will include the African and Indian elephants, white
Lippizaner horses, zebras and camels.
   ``I think it's time for Mark. I have to step back,'' said
Gebel-Williams, adding that he'll continue to work with the animals
behind the scenes.
   Gebel-Williams said he didn't plan anything special for his last
show, explaining that a change in routine would confuse the
animals. And he hopes no one calls for a speech.
   ``It'll be very tough, but as long as I don't have to talk I can
get through it,'' he said.
   After a lifetime with the circus, it would be impossible for him
- and his tigers - to give it up entirely, he said.
   ``I believe some of my tigers will miss this. Maybe once in a
while, I'll take them in the ring in Venice, turn on the music real
loud, and let them pretend.''

   Manuel Noriega got his day in court, accusing the
U.S. government of railroading him by freezing his assets and
forcing out his attorneys. A federal judge assured him he will get
a fair trial.
   Meanwhile, at a press conference in Atlanta, Cable News Network
on Friday denied a reporter's box full of tapes and other items on
the Noriega case was made available to the FBI.
   But CNN could not clearly explain a sister company's alleged
role in getting the box to federal agents Thursday.
   Speaking extensively to U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler for
the first time since he surrendered in January to U.S. invasion
troops, Noriega tried Friday to stop him from replacing private
defense attorneys with government-paid lawyers.
   ``I am now at the mercy of a totally unfair and unjust system
that chooses my prosecutors and now chooses my defense lawyers,''
the deposed Panamanian dictator said, reading quietly but
forcefully in Spanish from a prepared statement.
   Led by Frank Rubino, Noriega's lawyers say they can no longer
work unless the Panamanian's assets are unfrozen to pay them, or
the judge raises the $75-an-hour fee cap on court-appointment
lawyers.
   Hoeveler said he would rule in the near future, but reminded the
attorneys that raising the caps for the Noriega case was rejected
previously.
   He also said he received communications from ``some exceedingly
fine criminal defense lawyers'' willing to take the case under the
low government fee schedule.
   ``I want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift
by the court and by the judicial system,'' Hoeveler said.
   Earlier Friday, the private defense team filed a broad motion
asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client. It
argued that freezing Noriega's assets and taping his prison phone
calls was government misconduct.
   Hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion.
   In the CNN matter, the network claims the FBI contacted Turner
Security, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which also
operates CNN. The network says agents told Turner Security they
were searching for a box fitting the description of one hotel
security officers removed earlier in the week from the room of a
reporter assigned to the Noriega case.
   The FBI maintained that agents learned of the box from Turner
Security. Joe Shirley, head of Turner Security, did not return
repeated phone calls Friday.
   William Hinshaw, agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, said
Shirley called an agent investigating how CNN got the Noriega tapes
and told the agent that a box labeled ``Noriega tapes'' had been
removed from a hotel room. The agent, Hinshaw said, earlier had
contacted Turner Security about interviewing a CNN employee.
   ``I think when (Shirley) called he ... was just trying to
fulfill his responsibility,'' Hinshaw said.
   CNN general counsel Steven Korn insisted the FBI, not Turner
Security, made the first phone call about the box. When asked
whether CNN made the box available to the FBI, Korn replied:
``Emphatically, no.''
   Asked why Turner Security didn't give the box to CNN, Korn said,
``That's a good question.''
   CNN has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Hoeveler's
order, issued last week, barring it from broadcasting recordings of
prison telephone conversations between Noriega and his defense
team.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said Friday he didn't know if the
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes, or if
they contained phone calls between Noriega and his legal team.
   Noriega is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel.

   A leader of the fundamentalist Moslem
Brotherhood was elected to a one-year term as Jordan's Parliament
speaker on Saturday, beating out an ally of King Hussein for the
post.
   Abdullatif Arabiyat, 48, defeated former Interior Minister
Sulaiman Arar, who has been speaker for the past year. The vote was
41-28, with 11 abstentions in the 80-member Chamber of Deputies.
   The Brotherhood stands for the eradication of Israel and
stricter Islamic laws in Jordan that would mean banning alcoholic
beverages and closing nightclubs.
   Arabiyat is also speaker of the 22-man Moslem Brotherhood bloc
in Parliament.
   The party did surprisingly well in last year's elections, held
after the king allowed parties to contest parliamentary races for
the first time. The 40-man Senate is appointed by the king.

<TEXT>
   Union leaders put a strike deadline on hold
and negotiated through the night with management in a last-ditch
bid to avoid a walkout at the San Francisco Bay area's three
largest newspapers.
   Unions representing about 4,500 employees at the San Francisco
Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner and San Jose Mercury News had
threatened to strike at 5 p.m. Friday if an agreement on a new
contract was not reached. They continued talks indefinitely after
both sides said progress was being made.
   After working through the night, negotiators took a break about
7:30 a.m. today and planned to resume at 10 a.m., said Paul Avery,
a reporter for the San Francisco Examiner.
   ``The always hopeful sign is they're still talking,'' he said.
``People who are scheduled to work are going to work until we hear
differently.''
   As of late Friday, union and management were still far apart on
wages after reaching agreement on non-economic issues earlier in
the week, both sides said.
   The unions were seeking a 20 percent pay raise and a four-day
work week, while management suggested a wage freeze over the next
three years, with $80 lump sum payments made to each employee every
six months.
   ``Everyone is bargaining in good faith, and we feel comfortable
in stopping the clock to allow negotiations to continue,'' said
union spokeswoman Dawn Garcia.
   ``I'm confident we will reach an agreement if we stay at it,''
said Richard Jordan, chief negotiator for the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency, which runs Chronicle and Examiner business
operations.
   The previous three-year contract, which expired Feb. 2, gave
employees an average of 3 percent to 5 percent pay and benefit
increases each year.
   The three newspapers have a combined circulation of about 1
million. Top-scale pay at each is $801 a week for reporters, $669
for clerical and library workers and $675 for delivery truck
drivers.
   The Chronicle and the Mercury News, both morning papers,
published their Saturday editions as talks continued. The Examiner,
an afternoon newspaper, publishes a combined Sunday morning edition
with the Chronicle.
   San Francisco's last newspaper strike was in 1968 and lasted 55
days. The Mercury News was last struck in 1959, for four months.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III picked up
the vote of at least one African nation Saturday in his drive to
line up support for a resolution endorsing the use of military
force to get Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Zaire's foreign minister, Kalimba Wakatana Mushobekwa, said his
government would go along with a resolution in the U.N. Security
Council authorizing force if peaceful means failed.
   ``Yes, we support it,'' he said in response to reporters'
questions.
   But he also expressed the hope that a peaceful way would be
found to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Baker was upbeat after his talks with Mushobekwa and the foreign
ministers of Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast, all nonaligned nations
who are currently on the 15-member Security Council.
   ``I think we've had a positive day consulting with other members
of the council,'' Baker said after his hour-long meeting with
Mushobekwa.
   ``I don't want to get into the business of counting votes here
or predicting results or anything like that. But we've had some
good meetings today,'' he said.
   The United States would like broad support for its moves on the
gulf crisis by gaining approval from neutral and Third World
countries.
   After the sessions, Baker was flying to Paris where he was to
meet on Sunday with five more nations on the Security Council - the
Soviet Union, France, Britain, Finland and Romania.
   Baker, who flew Saturday morning to Geneva from Brussels,
Belgium, opened his latest round of talks with Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Tesfaye Dinka.
   Dinka described the discussions as ``very interesting'' and
replied, ``Yes, of course,'' when asked whether they were
successful.
   Simeon Ake, foreign minister of the Ivory Coast, said he wasn't
used to revealing private conversations to reporters and hurried
off to his waiting car.
   The talks were held at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations,
not far from Lake Geneva.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said Baker wanted foreign
ministers to travel to New York to adopt personally the resolution
on use of force. Foreign ministers rarely sit in their country's
seats on the Security Council except in particularly serious
situations.
   Baker has insisted that the Bush administration has made no
final decision on whether to offer the resolution for a vote. ``I
haven't seen a draft resolution yet,'' he said Saturday.
   But officials seem ready to go ahead and introduce the document
in the Security Council before the end of the month. The United
States holds the rotating presidency of the council in November.
Yemen, an Arab nation which has been sympathetic to Iraq, assumes
the chairmanship in December.
   The United Nations has approved 10 resolutions directed against
Iraq since its Aug. 2 invasion of tiny Kuwait.
   On a trip last week to the gulf, Baker made initial contacts
with the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France to get their
backing for the use-of-force resolution. As permanent members of
the Security Council, they could kill it with a veto.
   France, China and the Soviet Union have indicated they would
like more time to give economic sanctions and diplomacy a chance to
force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to pull his troops out of
Kuwait.
   On Sunday, Baker will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and may ask about a suggestion by a Soviet envoy that
a ``flexible linkage'' be drawn between an Iraqi pullout and a
conference to settle the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.

   Atlantis' five astronauts orbited
170 miles above the world amid military secrecy Saturday after
accomplishing their major objective, delivering a spy satellite
into space.
   The crew deployed the spacecraft from the shuttle Friday,
sources said. The satellite reportedly is to spy on Iraq by
eavesdropping on communications or conducting photo surveys.
   NASA refused to discuss the Defense Department flight, and
Mission Control issued only terse status reports. The last update
was Friday evening, when it was announced Atlantis would return to
Earth on Monday.
   ``Things are going well since we don't hear otherwise,'' said
Billie Deason, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Ted Molczan, an amateur astronomer in Toronto who tracks
spacecraft, said Atlantis is 170 miles high. Two amateur
astronomers, one in Florida and the other in Texas, spotted a
bright satellite orbiting in front of the shuttle at a slightly
lower altitude Friday night, he said.
   One of the observers said the satellite was rotating in flashing
shades of red, gold and a yellowish white, Molczan said.
   Atlantis returned to space for the first time in eight months
with a flawless liftoff Thursday. The shuttle had been grounded
over the summer by hydrogen leaks that were fixed by installing a
new external fuel tank, plumbing and valve seals.
   Columbia also was crippled by hydrogen leaks much of the year.
NASA expects to launch the spaceship with seven astronauts and an
astronomical observatory in early December.
   NASA prefers to have at least three weeks between shuttle
missions, but has said it will not wait that long so Columbia can
be up and back by Christmas. That would enable the agency to shut
down certain operations at the end of the year for routine
maintenance and to save on holiday pay.
   Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. EST Monday. Mission Control will
break its silence Sunday evening to announce a more precise landing
time.
   It is the seventh Pentagon shuttle flight to be conducted in
secrecy, and is due to be the last.

   A teen-ager wanted for investigation of the
drive-by shooting death of a 5-year-old girl killed himself after
police surrounded his apartment, authorities said Saturday.
   Rance Benson, 18, shot himself in the head in the inner city
apartment late Friday, said police Detective Jim Tiampo.
   Benson and a 17-year-old boy had been sought in the Nov. 10
slaying of Ashley Johnson, who was shot to death while she played
hopscotch at a birthday party, Tiampo said. The name of the
17-year-old, who was arrested Thursday, was not released because of
his age.
   Police said the gunfire that killed Ashley apparently was
intended for a group of rival gang members nearby.
   At a Friday news conference, police asked the public's help in
finding Benson. Officers went to the apartment after receiving an
anonymous tip that he was inside, and Benson barricaded himself in
a bedroom before shooting himself in the head. Police fired no
shots, Tiampo said.
   Earlier Friday, about 200 people attended Ashley's funeral.
Mourners also gathered on the street where she was shot to set up a
memorial of flowers and religious candles.

   Two bombs exploded near the spot where
the agriculture minister delivered a speech but the official was
not injured, a government spokesman said Saturday.
   No one was hurt in the blasts Friday, but some people were hurt
in the panic that followed, said the spokesman, Suvit Yodmani.
   The incident occurred in the southern province of Yala, about
670 miles south of Bangkok, said the spokesman.
   The Thai-language newspaper Matichon said the bombs went off
about 50 yards from a youth center in front of which the minister,
Chuan Leekpai, had given a speech 15 minutes earlier.
   An unspecified number of people were hurt in the panic, but the
bombs themselves injured no one, the paper reported.
   Radical Moslem groups, some demanding an indpendent Islamic
state, are active in the south of Thailand. Moslems account for
about 4 percent of Thailand's 50 million people.

   Masked raiders believed to belong to a
nationalist guerrilla group set off explosives at a seaside motel,
police said Saturday, but the motel was closed at the time and no
one was hurt.
   About two dozen bungalows and a central building were damaged in
the blast Friday night at the motel, on the coast of the Porto
Vecchio gulf in southern Corsica.
   A watchman and his wife at the motel were seized and taken to a
nearby home, where a father, mother and 6-year-old girl also were
tied up, police said, but none was injured.
   The six or seven raiders painted the letter ``R'' on a wall, the
customary manner in which several recent bombings have been claimed
by Resistenza, a nationalist group believed to have been formed by
guerrillas dissatisfied with the larger Corsican National
Liberation Front.
   The nationalists are fighting to become independent from France.
   Following the incident, authorities reported the arrest of two
men in Ajaccio, Corsica's biggest city. A firearm, explosives and
masks reportedly were found in their vehicle.

   Following is the transcript of an
address delivered by President Vaclav Havel on Saturday at
Wenceslas Square:
   Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Citizens. In recent years and in
particular in the past few months prior to November 1989, most of
us felt that tension in our society was building up and the gap
between promise and performance between the world of official
speeches and the real world was widening at a spectacular pace.
   We guessed that things could not continue the way they did and
that something was about to happen. None of us, however, knew when
the crucial change would happen and how it would happen. None of us
knew what would be the last drop to make the cup overflow, the
snowball setting the avalanche in motion.
   It was the students who set the avalanche in motion. Last year
they decided to commemorate Jan Opletal and the International
Students' Day by an independent demonstration. What followed is a
matter of common knowledge.
   A year has passed since then.
   And today we are standing here somewhat embarrassed. We know
very well what we still have to accomplish and the question
springing up to mind is why do we find it so difficult to launch
our joint project off the ground. Is it because we underestimated
the legacy of the old regime or overestimated our own capacity? Is
it because someone is deliberately trying to thwart our joint
effort, or are we marring our own endeavor?
   So it is with full justification that we are asking ourselves
today: Why did we fail to achieve this year even that stint of work
that originally struck us as the simplest job of all - namely to
shed light on all the circumstances of last year's massacre and
punish the real offenders. Why hasn't historic justice been given
full rein in a dignified and legally correct way? Why is our
political climate systematically poisoned by demagogy, by
political, ethnic and racial intolerance? Why - after we had
toppled in a humane way an inhuman regime - the crime rate
continues to increase at a dizzy rate?
   Each of these and similar questions can be answered in an
objective spirit and explained in a plausible fashion in a wide
variety of ways. Whatever the answer or explanation, the fact
remains that dissatisfaction, nervousness, insecurity and
disillusionment are widespread in our society. This is
understandable and to a certain extent it might serve a good
purpose. For isn't precisely impatience the factor that the
pressure inspiring a more radical and more speedy implementation of
social changes? Nervousness and impatience do not worry me too
much.
   What in my view is far worse are the attendant phenomena ever
more obvious at every turn: rancor, rivalry, mutual denigration,
envy and boundless ambition. It seems to me that these vices
infecting our public life are ever more rampant.
   Are we really a nation capable of reviving its virtues only once
in a twenty years' time? Virtues that only last for a few months?
Are we really a nation that only manages to kowtow to the oppressor
and when the cup finally overflows vie in the bravado of boasting
speeches and mutual defamation?
   I find it hard to believe that this our one and only - our sole
chief historical alternative, I find it hard to believe that the
spirit of tolerance and wisdom could not ultimately prevail in
Slovak souls and in Czech and Slovak public life.
   A small group of students invited the public to devote this
gathering to what could fittingly be described as meditation in
which everyone would search his own conscience. Yes, let us try to
search our own souls today! Let us try to reflect on our public
life in the spirit of calm detachment, with our own conscience
being the supreme judge. Let us try to see ourselves in a broader
human perspective - let us try to visualize the contours of our
frequently parochial, myopic and dimwitted action as perceived by
the civilized world!
   I see much stimulating food for this kind of self-searching
thought in the pleasant fact that it is precisely today that we are
honored by the visit of a representative of one of the world's
oldest democracies, the supreme representative of the great and
freedom-loving nation - the President of the United States of
America, George Bush!
   More than two hundred years ago, the newly arisen state found
itself confronting a situation very much similar to that
confronting us today. The new democracy was subjected to stringent
tests and ordeals. The distressing financial and economic
situation, doubts about the country's international status and the
feuds between different states of the confederation and politicians
frequently fueled fears for the country's future integrity. The
adoption of the American Constitution was gravely jeopardized.
   In the most significant political document of the day - in the
Federalist Essays, Alexander Hamilton appraised the situation as
follows: ``Among the gravest obstacles obstructing the passage of
the new constitution, one can easily discern the undisguised
interest of a certain group of people in each state to prevent the
coming of all changes threatening to restrict their power, to
diminish their profits and the significance of the offices they
hold; and the perverted ambition of another group of people
determined to profiteer from the confusion prevailing in the
country.'' The same lines might be written about our own country
today.

<HEAD>Thailand Threatens U.N. Officials Who Aid Burma Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has said it will expel
U.N. or other refugee officials who provide aid to Burmese
dissidents living in Thailand, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Chamnarn Potjana, deputy permanent secretary of the Interior
Ministry, on Friday warned international organizations to stop
helping Burmese students, according to the Nation newspaper.
   If they do not, Chamnarn was quoted as saying, ``no matter
whether they are officials of the UNHCR (U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees) or other United Nations agencies, we will ask the Foreign
Ministry to expel them from the country as persona non grata.''
   Thailand has close ties to the military government that took
power in Burma in 1988, crushing a student-led pro-democracy
movement. Thousands fled and many joined rebel groups based along
Burma's border with Thailand and India.
   The government began reconsidering the status of Burmese
dissidents after two Burmese students hijacked a Thai airliner
flying to their homeland on Nov. 10. Two other Burmese students
hijacked an jetliner to Thailand a year ago.
   Thaung Htun, a spokesman for the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front, said the Thai government ``should consider the problem of
Burmese students from a humanitarian point of view. Any person who
fled should have the rights of a refugee.''
   Chamnarn spoke after a Cabinet committee meeting to discuss what
measures to take regarding the students. He said the committee had
recommended establishing a holding camp for Burmese dissidents on
the Thai-Burma border.
   The Nation quoted Chamnarn as saying the High Commissioner
should use the $120,000 monthly allowance allocated to Burmese
students to establish the camp.
   The private U.S. Committee for Refugees estimates 2,000 Burmese
students live in Bangkok. Another 2,700 are on the Thai-Burma
border, according to the All Burma Students' Democratic Front, the
main group of exiled students.
   Thailand considers the students illegal immigrants subject to
detention, fines and deportation. The students depend on aid from
private relief groups and grants from the U.N. High Commissioner
that range from $40 to $120 a month.
   According to the U.S. Committee for Refugees, since 1988
Thailand has repatriated more than 5,200 Burmese, many of them
students. Amnesty International has cited reports that Burmese
authorities have brutally interrogated and tortured some students
repatriated from Thailand.
   The Bangkok Post quoted Chamnarn as saying that in addition to
the hijacking, Burmese students were believed responsible for a
small bomb attack recently on the Burmese Embassy compound in
Bangkok. He said Thailand would deport those who violated its
immigration law and penal code.

<TEXT>
   There is one source of optimism that could be tapped - namely
the fact that the United States overcame the initial spell of
crisis and developed into a powerful citadel of democracy shared by
all U.S. citizens, while providing at the same time a source of
inspiration and hope for all those who suffer oppression and
non-freedom in other countries.
   How did the United States accomplish this goal and how could we
accomplish it? First and foremost, America reached consensus on the
most fundamental piece of national legislation - the American
Constitution - which codified, and today continues to protect, the
fundamental human rights and liberties with unrelenting vigor:
freedom of speech, freedom of conviction freedom of assembly and
association - as well as the freedom of addressing requests and
complaints to the government.
   Secondly, they succeeded in persuading the American legislators
of the necessity of a strong federal government which, however,
retained only the most necessary powers indispensable for the
exercise of state sovereignty, for ensuring the country's defense
capability, for the protection of the international position of the
United States as a whole and for the free circulation of material
and immaterial property throughout the country. All other matters
remained within the legal competence of the states and the people.
   And most important of all, the Americans, just because they
upheld that wide-ranging decentralization of power, gave free scope
and elbow room to free decision making and creativity. This
decision was expressive of the trust and confidence in the
prudence, common sense and moral integrity of the free citizen, it
reflected the awareness that the citizen and the state are
answerable to each other only in matters delimited by the law, the
conviction that the citizens are more competent to administer some
of their affairs than the state itself.
   The democratic and prosperous America of today is the outcome of
the endeavor pooling the efforts of many generations of free
citizens. There is no other path for us to follow but the path of
the same effort - we should each seek and identify our own mistakes
and errors, we should insist on our own freedom without curtailing
the freedom of others.
   Dear friends, a year ago, the freedom-loving genius of our
nations scored a victory over violence and totalitarian rule. I am
convinced that at the present juncture, too, common sense, decency
and tolerance will triumph in each of us over ambitious rivalry,
egoism and intolerance.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 7th graf pvs, Perhaps as, and 12th graf pvs, Other drugs,
to CLARIFY that while 38 states make more arrests for marijuana
than for cocaine and heroin, total number of U.S. cocaine and
heroin arrests is higher than marijuana</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Ruth knows that smoking marijuana, once
virtually ignored by the public and police, is now considered ``a
very deviant thing. It's very taboo.''
   The 40-something San Francisco professional is married, has
children and a respectable job. She knows that even though
California's marijuana law is still relatively lenient, a drug bust
could threaten her livelihood.
   Yet she still smokes high-grade sinsemilla several times a week.
   Why?
   ``It's a very nice high,'' she said. ``Often in these drug
stories, people forget to mention that part.''
   Ruth is far from alone. Marijuana is the most popular illegal
drug today, the crack epidemic notwithstanding.
   Perhaps as a result, 38 states arrest more people for marijuana
than for cocaine and heroin combined, government statistics show.
Last year, almost 400,000 people were busted on some kind of
marijuana charge.
   The drug's popularity stems in part from the fact that it is a
known quantity - almost 66 million Americans have tried it at least
once, many of them during its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. The
1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 6.6 million
Americans used it once a week or more and 11.6 million had used it
in the previous month.
   It is considered relatively safe. Today's marijuana may be far
stronger than its counterpart a decade ago, as the government says,
but Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon notes there is ``no
reliable evidence of death caused by cannabis in a human being.''
   And it's relatively cheap. John, a scientist who uses sinsemilla
several evenings a week, says one ounce lasts him six months. That
ounce could cost as little as $100 and the same amount of
lower-grade marijuana can run $40.
   Other drugs - especially cocaine and heroin - are associated
with high crime and violence, particularly in the most populous
states. Police officers last year arrested 700,000 people for
cocaine and heroin nationwide, more than any other illegal drug.
   But in some states, nearly every drug arrest involves marijuana
- 86 percent in Vermont, for example, 82 percent in North Dakota
and 81 percent in Maine, according to FBI figures for 1988.
   Eight of every 10 marijuana busts is for possession of the drug,
the FBI says.
   The reason so many people are arrested on marijuana charges
seems obvious to one group - the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, which has advocated marijuana
legalization for two decades.
   Marijuana users ``are easier targets'' than, say, cocaine
traffickers, said NORML spokesman John Dunlap. ``They're a much
more passive lot. The government knows it's an easy public
relations victory.''
   Dunlap also contends there are just more marijuana smokers out
there - he estimates 30 million people use it once a week, far more
than the government estimate of 6.6 million.
   Many police departments that once paid little attention to
marijuana users have changed as attitudes harden toward all illegal
drugs. An example is Arizona's Maricopa County, which includes
Phoenix.
   ``The cops basically sort of ignored it'' a few years ago, said
Bill FitzGerald, spokesman for County Attorney Richard Romley.
   Today, the county boasts a ``Do Drugs, Do Time'' program
targeting all drug users.
   ``Every arrested person will be booked into jail for at least a
few hours,'' said Romley and County Sheriff Thomas Agnos in a paper
describing the program. For a casual user, even a brief jail stint
``drives home the gravity of the offense.''
   First-time offenders may enter a diversion program and,
according to FitzGerald's figures, three-quarters of the people who
did had been arrested on marijuana charges.
   Across America, government agencies have staged widely
publicized raids on outdoor marijuana fields, indoor growing labs
and stores that sell equipment for such labs in an attempt to
curtail domestic crops that provide an estimated 25 percent of the
U.S. supply.
   The government admits it conducts these raids in large part to
impress a foreign audience.
   ``We cannot expect foreign countries to undertake vigorous
anti-drug efforts inside their borders if we ourselves fail to do
likewise,'' says the National Drug Control Strategy issued in
January.
   Perhaps another reflection of changing attitudes about drugs,
laws themselves are becoming more stringent.
   Of the 11 states that decriminalized marijuana possession for
personal use during the 1970s, four have reversed course in recent
years.
   Alaska, which had actually legalized possession of up to four
ounces at home or other private places, voted Nov. 6 to make
possession of small amounts a crime again.
   Maine, Ohio and Oregon had already tightened marijuana
restrictions. But in seven other states - California, Colorado,
Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska and New York - a
marijuana arrest is more akin to a traffic ticket than a criminal
charge.
   William J. Bennett, who resigned after 20 months as national
drug control policy director, championed the stricter attitude and
campaigned for Alaska's marijuana measure.
   Although Bennett told The Associated Press last December that he
believed marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol, he rejected
legalization: ``The last thing I would want to do is recommend the
wider use of a drug that makes young people stupid.''
   Despite the increased risks, many longtime marijuana smokers
cannot imagine giving it up.
   John, the scientist who asked that his real name not be used,
said a single puff of sinsemilla ``facilitates the imagination and
has allowed occasional creative breakthroughs,'' some of which have
led to ``papers published in reputable journals.''
   His employers do not require random drug tests, but if they did,
``That would be enough of an insult to my freedom that I would quit
and contribute to the brain drain,'' said John, who is single.
   Steven, a 34-year-old Massachusetts attorney and father of two,
said, ``If I didn't use it, I think I'd be an alcohol abuser.''
Alcohol would hurt his health far more, he said.
   Steven, who did not want his last name used, recognizes the
legal dangers, but believes he would face only a reprimand, not
disbarment, if he were arrested on marijuana charges.
   To Ruth, who also did not want her last name used, marijuana is
``the best aphrodisiac there is.'' Alcohol is not an acceptable
substitute.
   ``You get drunk with alcohol,'' she said. ``You get sloppy. And
the next day you have a hangover. The worst that can happen with
marijuana is you get sleepy.''

   Bruce Springsteen's fans didn't change much
during the singer's two-year performance hiatus.
   Familiar yells of ``Bruuuuce! Bruuuuce!'' were so distracting as
he began his first formal concert since 1988 that the Boss had to
make a request.
   ``I'd appreciate during the songs just a little quieter so I can
concentrate on 'em,'' he told the sellout crowd at the Shrine
Auditorium on Friday night.
   Springsteen headed the bill for the concert benefiting the
Christic Institute of Washington, D.C. The benefit also featured
Jackson Browne and Grammy-winner Bonnie Raitt.
   The show was an acoustic affair, and Springsteen performed solo,
accompanying himself with guitar, piano and harmonica through more
than a dozen songs, including ``Darkness on the Edge of Town,''
``Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,'' ``Thunder Road'' and ``My Hometown.''
   His 90-minute set, including encores with Raitt and Browne, was
his first formal appearance since the Amnesty International Human
Rights Now tour.
   The fans were hungry. The 4,500 seats available to the public
sold out in 45 minutes. The institute, a liberal advocacy group,
got the remaining seats in the 6,300-seat auditorium. A second show
was added for Saturday night.
   Proceeds from the concert will finance an institute lawsuit
claiming that the U.S. government sanctioned illegal arms sales and
drug trafficking to finance private covert operations during the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The lawsuit, currently on appeal in a Florida court, is named La
Penca after a village in Nicaragua where a bomb exploded during a
news conference for contra leader Eden Pastora in 1984, killing
three journalists and injuring more than a dozen other people.
   Raitt said the institute had been having a rough time with the
lawsuit, but ``that's going to change because the truth will out.''
   ``Over the past decade the country's been sold an illusion of
itself,'' and the Christic Institute is trying to make everyone
``grow up,'' Springsteen told the audience.
   He was more effusive about developments in his life,
particularly the birth this July of his son, Evan. He recalled that
when his girlfriend, former backup singer Patty Scialfa, went into
labor he ``did Lamaze'' and then went shopping in search of a good
joke book.
   ``I figured the situation would get tense,'' he explained.
   The book he found was called ``How to be Italian,'' and although
he claimed to not have used it, some must have rubbed off.
   ``The baby came,'' he said, ``and Patty was beautiful -
bellisimo!''

<HEAD>VITAMIN A</HEAD>

   A form of vitamin A common in carrots and many other fruits and
vegetables appears to substantially reduce the risk of heart
trouble in people who already have coronary artery disease,
researchers have found.
   The findings about beta carotene are still considered
preliminary. But they raise the possibility that people whose heart
arteries are already clogged may be able to ward off heart attacks
and other cardiac problems by consuming the nutrient.

   A protein that a researcher calls the ``heart attack maker'' is
elevated in black Americans and could explain their increased rate
of heart attacks, says a study released Monday.
   ``It is helpful in explaining why some individuals have heart
attacks at early ages,'' said Dr. Thomas Pearson of the Mary
Imogene Bassett Research Institute in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   A study of white and black doctors in their 50s revealed that
levels of the protein were more than twice as high in the blacks,
Pearson said. The protein is called lipoprotein (a).

<HEAD>SMOKING-PAIN</HEAD>

   Cigarettes increase smokers' pain tolerance and could therefore
block the chest pains that serve as a warning for heart disease,
researchers said.
   In studies with 20 male smokers, ages 19 to 44, the researchers
found that the tolerance to pain increased with each of three
cigarettes smoked.
   Smokers are known to have a higher prevalence of what is called
``silent ischemia,'' said Dr. Paula Miller of the University of
North Carolina School of Medicine. Silent ischemia occurs when
blood flow to the heart is briefly interrupted because of the
buildup of fatty deposits and cholesterol in the arteries that
nourish the heart.
   Miller's study suggests cigarettes are at least partly
responsible for the increased prevalence of silent ischemia in
smokers.

   Men with clogged heart arteries and mild chest pain can be
safely treated with medicines alone, and bypass surgery does not
help them live any longer, a 10-year study concludes.
   The study shows that doctors need not rush to perform this
common form of surgery to save the lives of those with relatively
non-severe disease.
   ``It's remarkable that there was no difference in total
survivorship of these patients after 10 years,'' said Dr. Lawrence
S. Cohen of Yale University, a co-author of the study.

   Hostile teen-agers are likely to grow up to be adults who have
high cholesterol, according to a study that finds new links between
anger and heart trouble.
   For years, many experts assumed that hard-driving, impatient
people with classic Type A personalities were at high risk of heart
attacks. But many have grown skeptical of this theory, and some now
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and
anger.
   ``People with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high
cholesterol levels at 40,'' Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke
University said Wednesday.
   Williams' study was among several that suggest that hostile
people are more prone to heart trouble - both because of the
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their
tendency to have unhealthy living habits.

   Almost two-thirds of the 300,000 Americans who drop dead
suddenly each year from cardiac arrest might be saved if automatic
shocking machines were made as common as fire extinguishers, heart
specialists say.
   Catastrophic disturbances in the heart's normal rhythm - what
doctors call sudden death - account for about half of all heart
disease fatalities.
   Shocking the heart with a machine called a defibrillator can
restore normal beating. But the shock must be delivered within five
minutes, or the victim will die or suffer brain damage.

   About 2 million Americans unknowingly suffer from a breathing
disorder called obstructive sleep apnea that doubles their risk of
dying from a heart attack, researchers say.
   The disorder, in which people stop breathing for 30 to 60
seconds or longer during sleep, is most common in people who snore,
said Dr. Bernard Burack, a cardiologist at the Montefiore Medical
Center's Sleep-Wake Center in New York.
   ``That doesn't mean everyone who snores is going to drop dead,''
Burack said. But patients with the snoring-related disorder have a
risk of heart-related death 2.1 times the national average, Burack
reported at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart
Association.

   Doctors may be giving bad advice about the dangers of heart
disease by not considering the interaction of risk factors such as
high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking.
   ``Based on single factor determinations, they may be needlessly
alarming or falsely reassuring patients,'' said Dr. William B.
Kannel of Boston University.
   Kannel is one of the principal investigators with the Framingham
Heart Study, a 40-year-long study of 5,209 people in Framingham,
Mass., 25 miles west of Boston.
   Kannel and the American Heart Association announced the
development of a ``risk factor prediction kit'' that will enable
doctors to better estimate patients' heart disease risks.

<HEAD>Black Agents Claim Treasury Unit Discriminates in Hiring,
Promotion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms have filed a lawsuit saying the agency discriminates
in its hiring, promotion and evaluation of blacks.
   The suit claims the agency's ``discriminatory policies, patterns
and practices ... are manifestations of longstanding discrimination
on the basis of a characteristic common class: being black.''
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here Friday, seeks
declaratory, injunctive and back pay relief for agents currently
employed at ATF and for as many as 300 individuals who, according
to the suit, have sought and been denied employment by the agency.
   The bureau, established in 1972 under the jurisdiction of the
Treasury Department, is responsible for enforcement of laws
relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives and interstate
trafficking in contraband cigarettes.
   Treasury spokesman Jack Killorin declined comment on the
allegations Saturday, saying ``It is in the legal process.''
   Michael J. Riselli, one of two attorneys representing the
agents, noted that the ATF bureau recently was involved in
investigations of racially related bombings in Georgia and Florida.
   ``It's pretty striking and significant that you've got an agency
that from time to time gets called upon to help in civil rights
cases ... that doesn't handle its own problems in that area,''
Riselli said in a telephone interview. ``It's been a longstanding
problem.''
   Riselli said agents Larry D. Stewart of Marietta, Ga., and Mark
Jones of Lorton, Va., had tried to get the agency to deal with the
concerns in individual informal complaints they filed in June and
August 1989.
   Stewart and Jones are the plaintiffs named in the class action
suit.
   According to the suit, ATF employs approximately 2,000 special
agents, of whom 160 are black. Forty of those 160 have been hired
since April when Stewart and Jones filed a formal civil rights
complaint with the department, Riselli said.
   The attorney said most black agents are assigned to positions
which occupy lower government job classification levels.
   ``There's never been a black agent appointed to an executive
position, and only three have ever been appointed to GM-15 - merit
pay or managerial positions,'' Riselli said.
   Additionally, Riselli said ``many black agents are hired
specifically to perform undercover work, often involving drug
cases, yet they don't count that service in evaluation for
promotion.''
   He said Stewart has been with ATF since October 1978 and is
supervisory criminal investigator. Stewart has a bachelor's,
master's and doctoral degree but has been rejected for an executive
position more than 25 times, Riselli said.

<HEAD>Key Elections in Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose volatile
ethnic feuds sparked World War I, holds its first free election in
more than 50 years on Sunday. The results could be crucial to the
fragile Yugoslav federation.
   The central republic is torn by the same bitter geographic,
political and ethnic rivalries that plague Yugoslavia as a whole.
Ethnic squabbling dominated an acrimonious election campaign.
   The three rival nationalist groups - Serbians, Croats and
Moslems - all have political parties vying for power. Serbian
nationalists say that if they lose Sunday's vote they would refuse
to recognize the new authorities.
   In addition to the ethnic-based groups, the vote is being
contested by the reformed League of Communists and Premier Ante
Markovic's Alliance of Reformist Forces. Those two groups have
tried to appeal across ethnic barriers.
   ``A victory for any of the nationalist parties would trigger
uncontrollable tensions,'' said Nenad Kecmanovic, leader of the
Alliance in Bosnia.
   The nationalist parties are the Serbian Democratic Alliance, the
Croatian Democratic Union and the Moslem Union of Democratic
Action.
   Stjepan Kljuic, acting president of the Croatian Democratic
Union, denied that nationalist parties represented a threat. He
said the Communists and the Alliance were trying to frighten voters
into believing a nationalist victory would bring chaos and civil
war.
   Initial results from last week's elections in Yugoslavia's
poorest state, Macedonia, gave the Communists and Markovic's
reformers a clear lead over nationalist parties.
   Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, is best-known as the site of the
assassination in 1914 of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by young
Bosnian nationalist Gavrilo Princip, which was the spark that
ignited World War I.
   No single party appeared likely to win a clear majority in
Bosnia's 240-seat bicameral parliament. But opinion polls indicated
the Communists, the Alliance and the Moslems were running ahead.
   First official results were not expected until the end of the
week in the balloting, the republic's first free vote since 1938.
   Yugoslavia's largest republics of Serbia and Croatia, which
sandwich Bosnia-Hercegovina from the east and west, are main rivals
to steer Yugoslavia's future political course. Each has laid
territorial claims to Bosnia in the past.
   Serbia, still under Communist rule pending elections Dec. 9,
wants to keep power centralized in Belgrade, the Serbian and
federal capital.
   Croatia, where the center-right Croatian Democratic Union ousted
Communists in spring elections, wants Yugoslavia transformed into a
loose federation of near-independent states.
   Croatia is backed by Western-minded Slovenia, while Macedonia
and Montenegro favor maintaining the federation.
   Bosnia so far has steered a neutral course, and its future
position is to be decided by the election.
   Both Serbian and Croatian nationalists claim Bosnia for their
own, each group citing close historical and cultural links.
   But Alija Izetbegovic, president of the party that says it
represents the region's estimated 1.7 million Moslems, warned:
``Any attempt to redraw (Bosnian) borders ... would cause a blaze
that would engulf all nationalities living in the region.''
   Serbs make up about 30 percent of Bosnia's population and Croats
about 19 percent of the republic's 4.2 million people. Traditional
hostility has existed among the Moslems, the Roman Catholic Croats
and the Orthodox Serbs since Yugoslavia was founded as a kingdom in
1918.

<HEAD>More States Facing Prospect of Government Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRED BAYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's governor unveiled a plan Saturday to lay off or
furlough thousands of state workers, and talk of substantial
layoffs is intensifying in several other northeastern states.
   Across the nation, officials are trying hiring freezes and
budget manipulations to avoid letting people go. But as the economy
continues to soften, many expect state layoffs to become a common
news item.
   ``Everyone is preparing for it,'' said Linda Carroll of the
Council of State Governments.
   Marcia Howard, research director for the National Association of
State Budget Officers, said half of the states are experiencing a
decline in tax revenues, a barometer of a weakening economy.
   As the states collect less money than expected, budget deficits
grow, leaving state executives with the prospect of layoffs.
   ``This is the third year for many states that have had to make
budget cuts and even raised taxes,'' Ms. Howard said. ``They are
really to the point where all they can do is cut people.''
   In states with major deficits, stopgap measures like early
retirement programs and hiring freezes aren't enough.
   Massachusetts has laid off more than 1,700 state employees,
including social workers, mental health and environmental workers,
since Sept. 1. State officials spent the last year trying to hold
off layoffs through attrition.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo proposed a plan Saturday to correct a
potential deficit he said had grown to almost $1 billion. The plan
includes 2,000 layoffs and the elimination of an additional 4,000
state jobs through attrition and other actions by the end of the
current fiscal year March 31.
   Cuomo also called for all of New York's 250,000 state employees
to take a mandatory, five-day furlough, a move designed to save
$135 million. Legislators are expected to return to the capital for
a special session to deal with the budget problem within the next
several weeks.
   In New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio last week talked of reducing the
number of state departments and laying off workers. This comes
despite a year's hiring freeze and an increase in the state sales
tax and taxes on cigarettes and liquor.
   State Treasurer Douglas Berman announced Friday the state budget
was $600 million in the red and that layoffs were being discussed.
   Mike Moran, a spokesman for the New York Civil Service Employees
Association, said talk of the impending layoffs has a devastating
effect among state workers.
   ``People are worried whether they will have their job or wind up
working huge amounts of overtime to make up for those laid off,''
he said. ``What's sad about it is we are talking about people who
are providing real services.''
   In New Hampshire, 150 of the state's 10,000 workers were cut in
April. Dennis Parker, head of the New Hampshire State Employees
Association, said clients of the Health and Human Services
Department are affected the most.
   ``The phones are ringing a little longer because there are less
people out there doing the job,'' he said. ``It's foolish to think
you'll get the same level of services.''
   There have been no layoffs in Rhode Island yet, but attrition
and an early retirement program for state workers have cut
thousands from the payroll. A new state office building, built to
house 900 workers, has 650.
   Still, Brad Southworth, the state personnel administrator, said
layoffs are being contemplated.
   ``They are on the table now with any other action that may be
taken,'' he said.
   Other states are approaching the same crisis faced in the
Northeast.
   Lower than expected tax revenues last week prompted California
Gov. George Deukmejian to present the Legislature with a list of
cuts totaling $1 billion. Included in the package: a hiring freeze.
   North Carolina has already imposed a hiring freeze. Texas has
raised taxes. Ohio is considering austerity moves. Michigan faces
budget cuts.
   In Georgia, Pete Hackney, the legislative budget officer, said
the next Legislature faces the prospect of a ``tax or whack''
budget.
   ``I certainly hope they can be avoided,'' he said of layoffs,
``but I don't see how.''
   Other states seek to avoid crisis by taking early action.
   Despite a budget surplus, Indiana has reduced the number of
state workers from 38,000 to 36,000 through attrition since early
1989.
   And Colorado has cut 145 workers at the state Department of
Labor, a savings of $2 million. Unlike other states, Colorado was
able to make the cuts because of an improving economic picture.
State unemployment has dropped to 4.5 percent, the lowest in 16
years.
   Some government watchers believe actual or anticipated layoffs
of state workers are the conclusion of a growth in public workers
through the past decade.
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National
Taxpayers Union, said there are now 505 state and local government
workers for every 10,000 people, an increase from 476 at the
beginning of the 1980s.
   ``It's very disingenuous to believe they can't get along with
fewer workers,'' he said. ``A few years ago they didn't have these
people on the payroll.''

   Kitty Dukakis says she's looking forward to Jan.
3, the day her husband, Michael, leaves the governor's office.
   Mrs. Dukakis told a meeting of the National Association of
Social Workers on Friday about her ``one day at a time'' recovery
from alcoholism and her battle with manic-depression.
   She also spoke about her autobiography ``Now You Know,''
published in August. It details her stuggles to overcome addiction
to diet pills and alcohol and the ongoing manic depression.
   ``I am delighted by the response my book received,'' she said,
``but most importantly I'm moved and gratified, humbled really, by
the many people who have come up to me on the street and have
written to me, thanking me for telling my story.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said described the events leading up to her
hospitalization a year ago after drinking a small amount of rubbing
alcohol. The incident occurred several months after she was
released from an alcoholism-treatment program. She said she began
to feel depressed again in September 1989, a familiar feeling for
her in autumn.
   ``I had what we call a slip,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. ``Slips and
relapses are common among some recovering alcoholics and my slip
came in the form of rubbing alcohol I drank in the bathroom of my
own home.''
   But she said she is excited about the end of her husband's
administration and plans that will take them away from the state
for about 4\ months.
   ``Most of all, I am grateful for my sobriety,'' she said.

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - When he was in the ring, Muhammad
Ali claimed he could float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.
Now, the former heavyweight champion hopes his bravado will help
kids.
   Ali will record the rap tune ``Fight Against Hunger'' that will
premiere during a television special to raise money for children,
said Children's Peace Foundation spokesman Peter Georgi.
   Ali agreed to drum up support within the entertainment community
for the special scheduled to be broadcast in 1991, Georgi said
recently.
   The show will feature satellite links between several nations,
including the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, the Palace of Youth
in Moscow and the Berlin Wall in Germany.
   ``Our goal is to carry the momentum of the extraordinary
Children's Summit to the next logical stage,'' said Georgi.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - County music singer Lynn Anderson's
battle with her former husband, Harold ``Spook'' Stream, for
custody of their two children has turned ugly with allegations of
drug abuse.
   The custody fight is over the couple's 11-year-old son and
9-year-old daughter.
   During a circuit court hearing Friday, Anderson and Stream both
testified that although they once used cocaine, they are now
drug-free and challenged each other to take tests to prove it.
   ``I'll be glad to take a blood test or whatever you'd like,''
said Anderson to Stream's attorney. ``I think we're beating a dead
horse here. I think both of us have stopped doing anything like
that some time ago.''
   Stream - from Lake Charles, La., - denied using cocaine, except
when he was with Anderson. The couple divorced in 1982.
   Anderson testified that syringes that a housekeeper said she
found in the singer's luggage were for use in medicating her
horses.
   Anderson testified that her career is languishing. She said her
concert income has dwindled to almost nothing after publicity about
the custody battle and allegations that she abused her children.
   ``Most of my concert dates were canceled for the duration of the
year,'' she said. Anderson, country music's Female Vocalist of the
Year in 1971, is best known for her hit was ``(I Never Promised You
A) Rose Garden'' in 1970.
   Temporary custody of the children has been awarded to Stream, a
wealthy oilman who has since remarried.

   TOKYO (AP) - Thousands of people carrying lanterns and waving
flags thronged to the Imperial Palace grounds Saturday to celebrate
Emperor Akihito's enthronement.
   Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko, appeared at a palace
balcony and waved to the crowds, led by Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu.
   Police estimated 47,000 people took part in the event, organized
by government and civic organizations.
   The crowd paraded through main streets on their way to the
palace, waving placards hailing the nation's symbolic leader.
   The imperial couple also waved lanterns as the crowds shouted
``Tenno heika banzai,'' or ``Long live the emperor.''
   Akihito formally ascended the throne on Monday to become the
first Japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol and not a living god.
   He became emperor immediately after the death of his father,
Hirohito, in January 1989, but his enthronement was delayed until
last week, after a period of mourning.

   David Tesch came home to find his pet
missing - all five tons of her.
   Lydia, a 43-year-old elephant, had busted out of a cement
walking pen on Tesch's rural spread in central Polk County while he
was attending a circus in nearby Lakeland on Thursday night.
   When he got home, he discovered Lydia had broken through a
concrete-block wall, leaving a hole about the size of ... an
elephant.
   Tesch looked for his 9,700-pound pet without any luck. Fearing
she might wander off the property and get hurt, he called the Polk
County sheriff's office for help.
   Deputy John Mitchell was dispatched. As he drove around,
Mitchell envisioned headlines: ``Deputy Stomped.''
   A search of the Tesch grounds was interrupted by a tremendous
snort.
   ``I shined my flashlight at her, then I looked up. And up and up
and up,'' Mitchell said. ``She's huge.''
   But she's as nice as she is big, he said.
   Tesch led her quietly back to her quarters.
   ``No fuss at all,'' Mitchell said. ``Not a peep.''

<HEAD>Alaska's `High Plains Drifter' About to Ride Off Into the Sunset</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Cowper, the ``High Plains Drifter''
of Alaska politics, is about to ride off into the sunset again
after four bumpy years in the saddle as governor.
   His single term will come to an end Dec. 3, when Wally Hickel is
sworn in as Alaska's seventh chief executive. Cowper, who at 52
years old has had a variety of careers, says he has not yet decided
what his next one will be.
   A private man who admits a low tolerance for public life, Cowper
plans only to head for a warmer locale - Mexico. There he will
relax in obscurity for a couple of months before returning to his
adopted hometown of Fairbanks.
   It's a fitting exit for the restless politician whose colleagues
in the Legislature years ago nicknamed him after the Clint Eastwood
movie cowboy - a take-no-guff drifter of few words.
   Democrat Cowper expects a smooth transition to Hickel, whom he
considers a friend. The veteran Republican won the governor's race
on the Alaskan Independence Party ticket Nov. 6. Cowper predicts
Hickel will be more progressive than many of his conservative
supporters expect.
   Cowper's latest departure from politics comes 12 years after he
left his seat in the state House. Both times he decided not to seek
re-election.
   ``Some people want to cling to public office until they fall
over dead,'' the Virginia-born Cowper says in his thick Southern
drawl. ``I've never been one of that crowd. I got out of public
office before voluntarily, and happily I might add.''
   This time Cowper leaves behind a state with an improved economy
and a higher international profile, but with a dubious future that
remains tied to the up-and-down fate of world oil prices.
   In an interview, Cowper said his inability to wean Alaska from
its dependence on oil revenue was a major frustration as oil prices
plummeted and then recovered three times during his term.
   His efforts to promote state income and sales taxes failed when
rising oil prices eliminated the pressure on lawmakers to turn to
the more stable revenue sources common in other states.
   ``One of the problems here is that people who stand for public
office, for as long as I can remember, have always talked about
what's going to happen when the oil money runs out. But it never
seems to run out,'' Cowper said.
   ``People have gotten to the point where they don't really
believe it, or they don't believe it's going to happen in their
time. It's very difficult to get anybody to sacrifice anything for
something that may happen three years from now or 30 years from
now.''
   And what about Hickel's promises to reduce the budget?
   ``My observation would be that normally, if you have a large
surplus, it's extraordinarily difficult to make major budget
cuts,'' Cowper said. Because of the rise in oil prices since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, Alaska could reap up to a billion-dollar surplus
next year.
   Cowper considers his efforts to improve the economy as the top
achievement of his administration.
   ``When I was elected, the Alaska economy was in a very severe
downturn,'' he said. ``It was clear that the No. 1 thing on any
governor's agenda had to be to do whatever was necessary to put the
Alaskan economy back on track.
   ``You can look at the figures today and tell that that was
done,'' he said.
   Cowper cites as examples the successful effort to get a Federal
Express cargo hub in Anchorage, the administration's promotion of
international trade, its work with federal regulators to get the
state's banking system in order, and his 1988 jobs bill.
   The outgoing governor says he also laid the groundwork for
future trade and social ties with the Soviet Far East.
   In the Legislature, Cowper's victories included the tightening
of a major oil-tax break and major oil-spill legislation after the
Exxon Valdez disaster. But he also endured some major defeats.
   Cowper repeatedly was unable to get one of his favorite ideas,
the education fund, through the Legislature. The proposal would
have set aside earnings from the Permanent Fund, Alaska's
oil-wealth savings account, to pay for education as oil revenues
decline.
   That defeat was symbolic of what Cowper says is a tendency ``for
today's generation to grab everything they can as cheaply as
possible and leave the next generation holding the bag.''
   ``I think we have a duty to make the world better for the next
generation, and I frankly don't think many people agree with me.
But almost everything we did reflected that philosophy,'' he said.

   A photographer covering the 2 Live Crew
concert was detained by sheriff's deputies and forced to surrender
her film as she left the event.
   Photographer Kathy Anderson had taken pictures of the rap group
inside Club Mirage in this New Orleans suburb when one of the
band's crew members asked her to leave.
   The rap group, whose sexually explicit lyrics have created
controversy, had announced before the concert that no pictures
would be allowed, but Anderson said club operators told her she
could photograph the band.
   As she left the club, six Jefferson Parish deputies stopped her,
she said.
   Anderson, who works for The (New Orleans) Times-Picayune, said
Deputy Chief Eugene Fields demanded that she give up her film.
   She was allowed to leave after handing him two rolls of blank
film. She kept film that contained photographs of the band and one
appeared in the newspaper's Saturday editions.
   Sheriff Harry Lee said Friday the officers stopped Anderson
because a minor disturbance had broken out in the club about the
time she left. He didn't say why deputies confiscated her film.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands converged
Saturday in central Prague to commemorate the beginning of the end
of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia and to cheer President Bush for
standing behind their new democracy.
   About 100,000 people crowded into Prague's Wenceslas Square, the
site of daily demonstrations last year that led to the demise of
the Communist leadership and the election of former dissident
Vaclav Havel as president.
   The events began on Nov. 17 last year when police brutally beat
down a peaceful demonstration by students.
   People streamed to the square hours ahead of the planned
appearance of Bush and Havel. Some stopped to purchase caps printed
in patches of the American flag, or buttons bearing the U.S.
president's photograph.
   One young man, exhibiting the entrepreneurial spirit that will
be needed for a successful transformation to a market economy,
hawked copper-colored medals pressed by his father-in-law depicting
Havel, Pope John Paul II and the first President of Czechoslovakia,
Tomas G. Masaryk.
   Kids hung from the trees lining the square and students and
adults waved Czechoslovak and American flags.
   ``It is a kind of symbol that Bush came this very day,'' said
Zdenek Stojan, a 27-year-old building engineer. ``It shows support
of the United States for this country.''
   He recalled President Woodrow Wilson's support of Masaryk's
drive to create an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, saying,
``The Americans were at the cradle of the first republic.''
   One couple, who happened upon the ceremony while on a day trip
to the capital from their home town in central Czechoslovakia,
purchased a Czech-language copy of the U.S. Constitution, saying
they were curious about its contents.
   Some felt the timing of the President's visit was inappropriate.
   ``There are lots of celebrations around Bush and the students
who started it are almost forgotten,'' said Petr Novotny, a driver.
   About 3,000 people whistled during Havel's speech, expressing
dislike of his policies and the invitation to Bush.
   ``The current visit of President Bush is based on the fact that
Americans are often confused,'' said Miroslav Sladek, the leader of
the right-wing Republican Party, which failed to gain parliamentary
seats in the June elections.
   He charged the Bush trip was aimed at boosting what he called
the waning authority of Havel and the political movement he
founded, Civic Forum, which won the June elections.
   But Jiri Votruba, an artist, said Bush's visit was well-timed
because ``it's a symbolic day, and symbols, especially in Eastern
countries, are very important.''
   ``I believe it is important that people here feel that someone
as important as the U.S. president is standing behind them because
people fear it won't be as rosy as they had hoped,'' Votruba said.
   And Bush received bellowing applause when he pledged to stand
behind the new democracy.
   ``America will not fail you at this decisive moment. America
will stand with you,'' Bush said. His speech was translated into
Czech for the crowd.
   Bush, who was applauded several times during his speech, also
praised Havel, describing him as ``a man of wisdom and tremendous
moral courage.''
   The U.S. president promised two gifts to the Czechoslovak
people: Masaryk's 1918 declaration of Czechoslovak independence,
drafted in the United States and kept for 70 years in the Library
of Congress, and the last replica of the Liberty Bell.
   ``We want to help you spread liberty throughout your beautiful
land,'' he said, then tolled the bell three times ``once for your
courage, once for your freedom and once for your children.''
   The fervent applause that followed his speech subsided only as
the crowd joined in singing ``We Shall Overcome'' - the anthem the
students sang as they faced cudgel-swinging police who trapped them
in a narrow street near the square on this day last year.
   Many had tears in their eyes as they raised their hands in a
V-for-victory sign, singing the song over and over in both English
and Czech. The crowd dispersed with chants of ``Long Live Havel.''
   ``I'm glad I lived long enough to see American flags on
Wenceslas square,'' said Jindriska Maderova, 48. ``The bell was a
very beautiful gift.''

<HEAD>Senators Urge FBI to Release File on Reporter Slain in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's two U.S. senators are urging the
FBI to release information gathered during an inquiry into the
murder of a Tampa reporter in a cocaine-growing area of Peru last
year, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Sens. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Connie Mack, a Republican,
want FBI Director William Sessions to reconsider his agency's
refusal to disclose the file on the death of Todd C. Smith, The
Tampa Tribune reported.
   The newspaper requested the file last year under the federal
Freedom of Information Act.
   ``One year after Todd Smith's death, the nature of his brutal
murder - following his kidnapping and apparent torture - is
enveloped in a shroud of mystery. This case deserves to be
expedited by the FBI,'' the senators wrote in a letter sent Friday.
   The FBI was asked by Peruvian officials to investigate the
murder shortly after Smith's body was found last Nov. 21 in Uchiza,
a small cocaine boom town in a remote area of Peru.
   Smith, taking a working vacation from the Tribune to research
cocaine trafficking and terrorism, was kidnapped at gunpoint from
an airstrip in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley on Nov. 17, 1989.
   His body was found beside a soccer field four days later.
Officials said he had been strangled and beaten and had been dead
for about 24 hours.
   A sign found near the body denounced Smith as a spy linked to
the Pentagon. It was signed by the Communist Party of Peru, the
official name of Shining Path, a Maoist group that launched an
all-out guerrilla war in the Peruvian highlands in 1980. More than
20,000 Peruvians have died in that war.
   U.S. and Peruvian officials have not revealed more details about
the killing.
   Eight months after the Tribune made its request, the FBI said it
found one file with information about Smith but refused to disclose
it, claiming it would interfere with ``enforcement proceedings.''
   The agency has refused to elaborate on the nature of the file or
say whether the case remains open, but Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh recently assured the newspaper that the investigation is
continuing.
   The State Department, which operates an anti-narcotics force in
the Upper Huallaga Valley near where Smith was killed, offered
little information.
   Smith's father, Robert, said he was ``satisfied to believe''
Shining Path killed his son.
   ``I doubt anyone has access to anyone who has knowledge or the
willingness to talk about it,'' he said.
   Shortly after Smith's death, reports surfaced that he had been
``sold'' as an undercover drug agent to a Colombian narcotics
trafficker for a bounty of $30,000. Peru's former interior minister
endorsed that story, but journalists and U.S. Embassy officials
have since cast doubt on it.

<DATELINE>JUIGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orlando Lucas brought his family back
to Nicaragua the day after President Violeta Chamorro was
inaugurated in April, ending years of exile in Brazil, Venezuela
and the United States.
   With the leftist Sandinista Front gone from power and Mrs.
Chamorro's promise of a new beginning it was time to return
because, as Lucas thought, ``there's no place like home.''
   Seven months later, Lucas regrets his decision. He is one of a
growing number of people disenchanted with Mrs. Chamorro's
administration.
   ``This is a fiasco,'' said Lucas, an agronomist in his mid-40s.
   Mrs. Chamorro's supporters, stewing in discontent for months,
are now protesting because her government has made concessions to
the opposition Sandinistas to buy social peace.
   She took office April 25 after a resounding victory over
Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in Feb. 25 elections. But Mrs.
Chamorro allowed Sandinista commanders to remain at the head of the
military and police.
   Those who complain say that, while they believe Mrs. Chamorro is
well-intentioned, the minister of the presidency, Antonio Lacayo,
treats the Sandinistas with kid gloves and the president's
supporters with an iron fist.
   Lacayo, believed by most Nicaraguans the power behind Mrs.
Chamorro, has said his countrymen must shed a winner-takes-all
political heritage and learn to coexist peacefully and share with
the losers.
   The simmering discontent boiled over two weeks ago into a
protest movement by mayors and demobilized Contra rebels in the
rich agricultural region around Juigalpa, 85 miles southeast of
Managua.
   Protesters want Mrs. Chamorro to deliver on promises of land and
aid for the former U.S.-backed rebels who for nine years fought the
leftist Sandinistas.
   By the government's own figures, barely 3,000 of the 20,000
rebels who finished disbanding in June have received land.
   ``Our mistake was scheduling the laying-down of our weapons and
failing to schedule the fulfillment of her promises,'' said Oscar
Sovalbarro, a former Contra leader also known as ``Commander
Ruben.''
   ``The (Sandinista) army and police were the only ones who came
out ahead,'' he said. ``Now that we have disarmed, we feel
repressed and threatened.''
   The mayors and former rebels also want Mrs. Chamorro to fire
army chief Gen. Humberto Ortega, brother of the former Sandinista
president, and the regional chiefs of the Sandinista Police and
Sandinista People's Army.
   ``I voted for a change. There's been no change,'' said Jose Luis
Gutierrez, a civilian who helped the Contras when they were still
guerrillas roaming the lush hills of Boaco and Chontales provinces,
fighting the Sandinistas.
   The mayors and former rebels have also asked Mrs. Chamorro to
fire Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado, in charge of the police, and
Lacayo, the president's son-in-law.
   Lucas, Gutierrez, the mayors and ex-rebels are not alone in
their discontent.
   Mrs. Chamorro's attempts to reconcile her countrymen in
post-Sandinista Nicaragua have resulted only in alienating nearly
all those sectors that helped bring her to power.
   Business leaders are bitter. Returning exiles are dismayed. The
former rebels feel betrayed. The Roman Catholic Church led by
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo has been unusually outspoken in
condemning her government's actions.
   Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition is deeply divided.
   Even her own family newspaper, La Prensa, published a stinging
editorial this week entitled ``The President Sees With A Limited
Perspective.''
   It chided Mrs. Chamorro for asking protesters to go back to
their homes and jobs and accused her of failing to grasp the
country's political reality.
   ``They cannot go back to work, as President Chamorro would like,
because armed Sandinistas are the only law that prevails in many
regions of the country, especially the areas where the protests
have occurred,'' the editorial said.
   It accused Mrs. Chamorro of allying herself ``with those who are
really sabotaging her healthy government policy'' - a reference to
the Sandinistas.
   Even her estranged vice president, Virgilio Godoy, is rumored to
have been stirring up the protest movement. Godoy, while denying
his involvement, called it ``a beautiful civic protest.''
   The protest movement has blocked off one-fifth of the country
and resulted in 10 deaths and dozens of wounded in clashes between
police and protesters.

<TEXT>
   Robert Kearns' voice lacked the giddiness one
would expect from someone about to get a $10.2 million check from a
huge corporation. To the 63-year-old inventor, getting justice from
the patent system is even more important than the money.
   Kearns settled a 12-year-old patent infringement lawsuit against
Ford Motor Co. last week. And he still has similar suits pending
against other automakers.
   At issue was his patent for intermittent windshield wipers,
which go on and off periodically. They are a part of nearly every
new car sold these days.
   For Kearns, who lives in a one-bedroom rented apartment with
rented furniture in Houston, the money isn't bad, but the case is
mainly about winning fairness.
   ``I don't mean to be so harsh on the patent system, but an
infringer can just follow what has happened in this case and usurp
the ability of inventors to start new businesses,'' Kearns said in
a telephone interview from a friend's house in Maryland, where the
settlement was approved.
   Ford attorney Malcolm Wheeler said the settlement was fair but
Ford would have won if the case had been retried.
   There will be several million left for Kearns after the Ford
settlement is shared with his attorneys. It will easily be enough
to buy a house he wants in Texas and to finance his legal battles
against 19 other automakers.
   ``If I don't go further, there really isn't a patent system,''
he said.
   Each of Kearns' suits alleges basically the same thing - that
the companies profited from his windshield wiper patent and he
should share the money they made.
   Settling the cases or winning in jury trials could mean more
millions for Kearns. And millions more for attorneys.
   Kearns and one member of his legal team, Bill Durkee of Houston,
declined to say how much the case against Ford cost. There have
been estimates that legal bills ran more than $300,000. A standard
contingency fee of one third of the settlement would give Durkee's
firm $3 million to $4 million.
   ``(Lawyers) are running a business,'' Kearns said. ``I'm running
a cause.''
   Kearns had claimed he installed a set of intermittent wipers on
a Ford and took it to the automaker. Kearns, a professor at Wayne
State University in Detroit at the time, said he was led to believe
Ford would buy his invention by the number of questions engineers
asked.
   When that failed to happen, he sued.
   Originally, Kearns sought $141 million from Ford. In July, a
jury ordered Ford to pay $5.2 million, plus interest, for patent
infringement, for a total of $8.5 million to $11.5 million. Kearns
appealed the award and the settlement was reached before the appeal
could be decided.
   Ford dealers have sold an estimated 20 million Ford, Lincoln and
Mercury cars with intermittent wipers. After legal defense costs,
the settlement nets Kearns 33 cents per car.
   The problem as Kearns sees it is the patent system's failure to
protect small inventors from predator corporations by making it
difficult to prove the validity of their patents.
   The mere mention of some similar device recorded somewhere
before the patent was issued could be ammunition in a corporation's
legal guns.
   ``The inventor is up against every dusty lbrary in the world,''
Kearns said.
   In some cases, the patent system works fine.
   ``If a person was an inventor whose only intent was to conceive
of something and then pass it on to someone else, maybe that's
still viable,'' Kearns said.
   But when someone like Kearns wants to bring an invention to
market, the patent system is a roadblock because it allows for a
legal morass like the one Kearns found himself in.
   And that goes back to money.
   ``I think the thing that would help the inventors most would be
fast trials,'' said patent attorney Richard Samuel of Philadelphia.
He represented Gordon Gould in his successful patent fight over the
laser.
   ``I think that probably from a legal perspective, the problem is
more one of the cumbersomeness of the courts,'' Samuel said. ``It's
an expensive process and the individual inventor can't afford to go
through the courts.''
   Samuel said things are getting better for inventors though. In
the early 1980s, a federal appeals court was established just for
patent cases.

<HEAD>Moody's Lowers Some Philadelphia Bond Rates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Citing the ``scant progress'' city officials
have made toward solving the financial crisis, Moody's Investor
Service has demoted two more municipal bonds to junk-bond status.
   On Friday, Moody's dropped the rating of the city's water and
sewer bonds from Baa to B. The airport revenue bonds dropped from
Ba to B. Moody's assistant vice president Nancy Barbe called it a
``very significant'' drop.
   Unless action occurs in the next several weeks, the city expects
to run out of money by mid-December, disrupting payroll and
services. An effort to avoid the immediate crisis by floating $375
million in short-term notes last August failed when banks refused
to guarantee them.
   In September, Moody's lowered the city's general obligation
bonds to a B rating, one rating short of default, following
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. move to drop the rating to CCC, the lowest
among major U.S. cities.
   Standard's rating indicates Philadelphia is vulnerable to
default on bond payments.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other Democratic leaders in the state
have proposed trying to float another bond sale to keep from going
broke. They also want to raise taxes, pry more money out of the
state and federal governments and sell city assets to head off a
$229.5 million deficit at the end of the fiscal year.
   The plan, released earlier this month, received a poor reception
from City Council and Republicans. Moody's called it vague. Two
members of City Council have promised to offer alternatives this
week.
   ``Everyone seems to be talking about the need for the
development of a political consensus before the city's fiscal
problems can be addressed. It's not clear that consensus has been
achieved,'' Ms. Barbe said.
   Goode's office did not return telephone calls for comment.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader: Pope To Back Message that Anti-Semitism Is `Sin'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has promised to push forward
efforts, especially in Eastern Europe, to spread the message that
anti-Semitism is a ``sin,'' a British Jewish leader said Saturday.
   The pope met with directors of the British Council for
Christians and Jews at the Vatican on Friday and told them he was
``very pleased'' about continuing contacts between the two faiths,
including a meeting in Prague in September.
   Catholic delegates at that meeting condemned anti-Semitism as
well as all forms of racism as ``a sin against God and humanity.''
   That statement came at the end of the first formal meeting in
five years of the Pontifical Commission on Religious Relations with
the Jews and the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious
Consultations.
   Sir Sigmund Sternberg, a British Jewish leader present at the
meeting Friday with the pope, said he was encouraged that John Paul
repeated the words of the Prague declaration.
   He said he told the Polish-born pontiff that he was concerned
about the growth of anti-Semitic incidents in Eastern Europe and
expressed his concern that ``the pope's view be known at the
grass-roots level.''
   ``The pope assured me that he would get the message out'' at the
parish level about anti-Semitism being regarded as a sin, Sternberg
said.
   He expressed optimism about efforts, started after the Second
Vatican Council in the early 1960s, to improve relations between
religions.
   ``You cannot undo in 25 years the damage done in more than 1,900
years,'' he said.
   A plan drawn up at the Prague conference called for the
establishment of courses for priests to counter anti-Jewish
sentiment. It also recommended swift dissemination of recent
Vatican statements on Catholic-Jewish relations by Eastern European
churches.
   Sternberg was involved in helping to defuse a major dispute that
threatened to derail efforts to mend Roman Catholic-Jewish
relations.
   The dispute centered on the presence of a Catholic convent just
outside the site of the World War II concentration camp at
Auschwitz, or Oswiecim, Poland.
   Jewish groups said the convent and its Christian symbols,
including a 23-foot-high cross, offended the memory of the 2.5
million Jews who were put to death in the camp only because they
were Jews.
   After bitter controversy, it was decided to construct a
religious center for the nuns about a quarter-mile from the death
camp.

<HEAD>More Than 50,000 March to Demand Truth About `Gladio'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 demonstrators marched through Rome
on Saturday demanding the truth about the anti-communist network
known as Gladio, established during the Cold War and kept secret
until recently.
   The protest, organized by the Communist Party, also called for
more disclosure about a series of mysterious terrorist attacks in
Italy from 1969 through the early 1980s.
   The Communists, Italy's second-biggest party, have speculated
that Gladio may have been linked to the terrorist attacks
attributed to the right wing from 1969 to the early 1980s, when the
party came to the brink of power.
   ``We are here to obtain truth and transparency,'' Communist
Party leader Achille Occhetto told the crowd in the central Piazza
del Popolo at the end of the march.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti last month disclosed the existence of
Gladio, a network of civilians trained by the Italian secret
services to form a guerrilla movement in the event of a foreign
attack. It was active until last month.
   Since his announcement, other European governments have
acknowledged similar organizations in their countries. Several were
coordinated through NATO and some received U.S. aid.
   Traffic police said between 50,000 and 60,000 people took part
in the demonstration, while national police put the number at
100,000. Organizers said 400,000 people joined in.
   Some marchers dressed up as gladiators. Gladio was named for the
doubled-edged swords carried by Roman gladiators.
   Occhetto on Saturday called for a special parliamentary
commission to investigate Gladio. He also reiterated his demand
that Andreotti step down for having failed to disclose the
existence of the group.
   So far, none of the five parties forming the coalition
government has endorsed the demands.
   Parliament last week opened hearings on the secret operation.
Gladio is also under investigation by a Rome magistrate.
   In Germany, meanwhile, a magazine reported Saturday that the job
of the German banch of Gladio was preparation for sabotage attacks
and resistance behind enemy lines.
   The government said Friday the German branch still exists. But a
government spokesman said the units would not have been assigned to
conduct behind-the-lines sabotage operations.
   The weekly magazine, Spiegel, said the German branch had
operated beginning in 1959. It said that the Allied Coordination
Committee at NATO had ordered the dissolution of the secret
network, and that Germany was to try to accomplish this by 1991.
   The report, appearing in the magazine's Monday edition, was made
available in advance to other news organizations.

   On an island in the Tigris, just a little
south of Saddam Hussein's presidential palace, a small group of
Europeans say they are risking their lives for peace.
   It is an idea they hope catches on.
   ``The idea is to work toward filling the battlefield with peace
workers before any war can break out. This has never been done
before in history,'' said Ulf Amsell, a lanky 46-year-old transport
worker from Sweden.
   ``If more people follow my idea, it can be effective. Perhaps
5,000 would be enough. This is my purpose.''
   Amsell and his companions at the World Peace and Friendship Camp
say they are voluntarily making themselves ``human shields'' in
this country that is already holding thousands of other Westerners
against their will, including some detained at potential military
targets.
   Iraqi officials are delighted to host the European pacifists in
the tiny island cottages usually reserved for honeymooners.
   Their willing presence, in Iraqi eyes, bolsters the government
argument that the Western hostages are guests, playing a role for
peace by deterring an attack by U.S. and allied forces in Saudi
Arabia.
   But unlike their compatriots, these Europeans can leave Iraq
whenever they want. And most plan to stay only for a week or two.
   ``I am not afraid they will keep me here,'' said Jon Peter Oie,
31, of Norway. ``No one in the world can come here if they keep the
peace workers.'' Officials from Iraq's Ministry of Information and
Culture have arranged lectures on Iraqi history for the Europeans
and bus tours to factory sites around Baghdad. They also trot the
peace activists out before the world press.
   ``We've received many requests and applications from peace
activists from various parts of the world to establish peace camps
in many parts of Iraq, in many towns and even on the front lines,''
Information Minister Latif Nsayyif Jassim said Saturday.
   ``We highly appreciate and respect all these volunteers who have
come here to serve peace out of human and moral considerations,''
he added.
   On Saturday, the Europeans were taken to a clothing factory in
Baghdad where they were cheered by the women behind the sewing
machines.
   They were also told by the plant manager that the invasion of
Kuwait is an Arab problem that can only be settled by Saddam's Aug.
12 proposal, which linked the crisis to the solution of all other
Middle East problems.
   ``We do not support the Iraqi government,'' insisted Rino La
Rocca, a 38-year-old photographer from Naples. ``We have been very
critical of the government. I support the Iraqi people during this
very dangerous situation.
   ``We are testifying with our physical presence to our desire to
avoid war,'' he said.
   ``We have been criticized by leftist parties in Italy for coming
here,'' added Nesi Manlio, 36, another of the 13 Italians at the
camp. ``But the parties just say a lot of words about war and do
nothing to stop it.
   ``It is too easy to be against war in Italy. I have a job, a
car, a house. It is too easy to say you are against the war. Here i
am risking my life and that is important,'' he added.
   The group at the camp also includes six Soviets, led by
Stanislov Korolev, a professor of theology in Moscow.
   He said the Soviets had never heard of the camp until they were
taken there by Iraqi authorities after their arrival in Baghdad.
   Outside the camp's cottages are posted signs in French and
English with slogans such as ``Messengers of Peace Greet Saddam
Hussein, Man of the Hour,'' and ``USA Enemy of Man.''
   ``Cut Off Heads, Not Sustenance,'' read one.
   The signs were put up by the Iraqis, and some were decorated
with pictures of Saddam.
   The peace activists emphasized that their presence did not mean
support for Saddam.
   ``I don't want to be used by anybody. I don't support the Iraqi
government,'' said Oie. ``I only support peace.''
   Antonella Straface, 28, of Bari, Italy, an Islamic philosophy
student at the University of Naples, said she had come to Iraq to
visit two friends held hostage and to ``see it with my own eyes.''
   She said she did not believe what was written about Iraq in
Western newspapers.
   ``The West has supported the policy of this government. All of
us know the policy of this man (Saddam) - the policies against the
Kurdish people, the people of Iran. But no newspaper in Italy wrote
against those policies.''

   Thousands of elated children greeted Santa
Claus on Saturday as the Santa Train made a bittersweet ride
through the impoverished Appalachian mountains.
   About 12 tons of toys, snacks and gifts were tossed to eager
children - and a few greedy adults - as the train made its 48th
annual run through Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. The train
ride kicks off the Christmas season for small coal towns between
Pikeville, Ky., and Kingsport, Tenn.
   But many who helped Santa toss gifts to excited youngsters
lining the tracks spoke of the experience with a tinge of sorrow.
   ``If you can go and throw this stuff off without crying, you're
a better man than I,'' said Darrell Rice of Kingsport, one of the
dozens of volunteers aboard the train.
   The trip is sponsored by CSX Transportation of Jacksonville,
Fla., and the Kingsport Area Chamber of Commerce. Companies across
the nation donate boxes of merchandise: magnetic backgammon sets,
pencils, packets of instant oatmeal, bags of pretzels and comic
books.
   One of the train's seven stops was in Elkhorn City, Ky.,
straddling the Kentucky-Virginia border. Marietta Hogson of
Ferrell's Creek guarded her 5-year-old son, Adam, as a crowd
clamored for Santa's attention.
   ``I'm afraid he'll get trampled if he gets too close,'' Mrs.
Hogson said.
   The train winds through the major coal producing areas of
Appalachia, where some communities are suffering from coal industry
layoffs. CSX and Chamber of Commerce officials say the gummy bears
and tablets that kids pluck from between the rail ties may be all
they receive for Christmas.
   Gregory Belcher of Elkhorn City disagreed.
   ``A lot of people are out of work in this area, but I don't
think it's that bad,'' he said. Belcher's son, Christopher, dropped
off an armload of tablets, pencils and a cookbook, and then
sprinted back to the crowd for more.
   ``The focus of this, as far as I'm concerned, is the great
tradition of the train,'' said Frank Brogden, who has served as
Santa Claus since 1984. ``I think some people would think they
would be put down a bit if you focus on poverty.''
   Parents with video cameras showed up at many of the train
crossings. And the seamy side of Christmas was apparent as a group
of adults chased the train from crossing to crossing in
southwestern Virginia to hoard gifts.
   CSX spokesman Tim Hensley wouldn't specify the cost of the train
ride, formally known as the Santa Claus Special.
   ``It costs a whole lot of good will,'' Hensley said. ``We
operate this train from the bottom of our heart, not the bottom
line.''
   The tradition began in 1943 when the line was part of the
Clinchfield Railroad. Organizing and distributing the gifts is a
dizzying effort. For 38 years, Raymond Galyon of Kingsport has
helped solicit donations from merchants and businesses.
   ``I put about 300 hours a year doing this,'' said Galyon,
sitting atop boxes of gifts. This year's bounty was valued between
$150,000 to $200,000, he said.
   At a stop in St. Paul, volunteers furiously tossed buckets of
gifts at the crowd. As Christmas carols played on a tape player,
Santa handed out the larger toys - plastic trucks or dolls - to
youngsters.
   The Christmas spirit aboard the train was infectious, in large
part because of Lois Mee of Durham, N.C. She donated 30 boxes of
gifts, including 243 dolls with hand-knitted dresses, 112 pair of
mittens and hundreds of suckers.
   ``Honey, this is the happiest day of my life. I'm so thrilled I
can't get over it,'' said Mrs. Mee, dressed in a bright red sweater
and green jacket. ``I'm tenderhearted, I guess. If I was a
millionaire, I wouldn't have a dime.''

   U.S. Navy Seals checked a landing
zone for mines and obstacles Saturday to prepare for a mock assault
from the sea by U.S. and Saudi marines in an exercise menacingly
named Imminent Thunder.
   About 500 to 800 troops will hit the beach Sunday. Commanders
said the key objective is to practice an assault from ships that
are 30 miles from shore.
   The technique is called over-the-horizon, which gives the
attackers the element of surprise because an enemy won't know which
beach is targeted.
   ``It's a new capability. Nobody else has it,'' said Rear Adm.
John B. LaPlante, commander of the amphibious strike force.
   The war games also allow troops to practice the tricky work of
getting troops ashore under cover of warplanes. Troops will be
ferried by landing craft and attack helicopters launched
simultaneously.
   ``Amphibious warfare is an immensely complex thing to bring
off,'' LaPlante said. ``It's difficult and it takes practice and
training.''
   Among the first tanks to hit the beach will be an M-60 model
nicknamed ``Sodamn Insane.'' Cpl. James Quade, 25, of Lexington
Park, Md., said the amphibious exercises have become so commonplace
that many Marines are treating it as just another day.
   ``The only part we get geared up about is to make sure we don't
have any of the tanks go down,'' said Quade, a forward observer
with Alpha Company of the 2nd Tank Battalion.
   Reports of the six-day exercise were taken from pool reports,
based on briefings given aboard the USS Nassau, the flagship for
the amphibious landing.
   Imminent Thunder is the fourth amphibious exercise staged in the
gulf since Operation Desert Shield was launched in August.
   However, it is the first on Saudi soil, the first to involve
U.S. and Saudi marines and the largest force of warplanes used in
war games by a multinational force assembled to check Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   About 1,100 aircraft are involved in the exercise, but military
officials said they won't all be airborne at once.
   ``It doesn't mean the skies at the beach are going to be black
with aircraft,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Ron Morse, a U.S. Navy spokesman.
   One of the objectives is to keep aircraft from running into each
other. Flight controllers have given different ceilings to
helicopters and attack jets such as AV-8B Harrier close support
jets, F/A-18 Hornets, F-14 Tomcats and A-6 Intruders.
   About 50 British aircraft are also involved in the drill,
including Nimrod surveillance planes and Tornado and Jaguar attack
jets.
   ``The biggest challenge is to make sure we have aircraft
separation,'' said Cmdr. Mickey Haskins, commanding officer of
Tactical Air Control Squadron 22.
   Navy Cmdr. Dave Stewart, also known as ``Air Boss,'' controls
the Harriers and Cobra helicopter gunships from the flight deck of
the Nassau.
   ``This is my fifth national crisis in about 20 years, and
they're all about the same,'' Stewart said.
   Although the number of warplanes was significant, LaPlante said
the number of Marines and ships involved was ``very modest in size
and scope.''
   Imminent Thunder involves 16 ships, including the aircraft
carrier USS Midway and its battle group and the battleship USS
Wisconsin. Five amphibious assault ships are being used.
   Iraq has called Imminent Thunder a ``provocative act.'' The
Pentagon has denied it was designed to stir up the Iraqis.
Officials say the landing will be about 100 miles south of the
Kuwaiti border on an unnamed Saudi beach.

   Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem
cleric on Saturday urged the release of all Western hostages on
humanitarian grounds, in his second such appeal in three days.
   ``We have to work for closing the file of the hostages and those
unjustifiably detained, be they Iranians, Americans, Europeans or
Lebanese,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said.
   ``This whole file should be closed because it is a humanitarian
issue.'' Fadlallah is the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, the umbrella organization for
underground Shiite factions believed holding most of the 13
Westerners in Lebanon, including six Americans.
   ``To those who think that releasing the hostages would be in
favor of the Western states, we say it would be in favor of
humanity, which is not separate from Islamic values,'' Fadlallah
said in a statement.
   The spiritual leader made a similar appeal Thursday.
   More than 300 Shiite Moslems are held at the Khiam prison in
southern Lebanon, controlled by the Israeli-affiliated South
Lebanon Army militia. Several are Hezbollah fighters.
   Their release, along with that of Arab prisoners held in Israel,
has frequently figured among demands put forward by the captors of
Western hostages.
   Hezbollah says an undisclosed number of its members are held by
Christian militias in east Beirut.
   Fadlallah did not directly link release of the Western captives
to revealing the fate of four missing Iranians or the release of
Arabs in Khiam and Israel.
   Fadlallah's past statements encouraging the release of Western
hostages appear to have had no tangible effect on the kidnappers,
despite the influence of his religious authority.
   But when a group calling itself Organization Islamic Dawn
released Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed in April, it said
the releases were partly at the ``behest of senior religious
leaders.''
   Relatives of the four Iranians who disappeared in Lebanon's
Christian enclave in 1982 arrived here Tuesday in an effort to
obtain information.
   They have met with politicians and religious officials. They say
they received information that the four are being held at a prison
run by Christian warlord Samir Geagea in the Faraya ski resort
northeast of Beirut.
   Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia has said, however, the four
were killed by rival Christian chief Elie Hobeika.
   The Iranians crossed into the Christian heartland Saturday for a
30-minute audience with Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head
of Lebanon's dominant Maronite Catholic community.
   The patriarch said he had conflicting reports about the fate of
the Iranians and that he would try to establish the truth about
their fate.
   The longest held of the 13 missing Westerners is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Palestinian families in Arab east Jerusalem
held receptions Saturday to mark the 40th day of mourning since
their relatives were killed in the Temple Mount shootings.
   At Abdel Rahman Kashour's house in the walled Old City, a white
flag flew outside instead of a traditional black flag. Kashour's
19-year-old son, Burhan, was by Arab accounts the first to be
killed when police opened fire on the mount Oct. 8, killing at
least 17 Palestinians.
   ``This is the day of a wedding, not mourning,'' said Kashour, a
62-year-old electrician, explaining the white flag. He said his son
was nicknamed the ``bridegroom of al-Aqsa'' after the revered
mosque atop the mount, the third holiest shrine in Islam.
   The flag was decorated with an Islamic saying: ``There is no God
but one God.''
   An Israeli government investigation blamed Palestinian
stone-throwers for the riot. But it criticized police commanders
for their failure to anticipate trouble and said there were
instances of ``unsupervised'' gunfire.
   There has been a shake-up within the police, but no disciplinary
action was taken against officers mentioned in the report.
   The Temple Mount is known to Arabs as Haram es-Sharif, or
``Noble Sanctuary.'' Tradition says Prophet Mohammed ascended to
heaven from the spot. It is also revered by the Jews as the site of
their ancient Temple, destroyed by the Romans.
   ``God gave Burhan to me and God took him away,'' said Kashour, a
devout Moslem. ``What makes it easier is that we believe in God.''
His wife wept.
   A picture of Burhan hung on the wall, surrounded by flowers and
about a dozen small plagues brought by visitors. Hundreds came to
Kashour's house Saturday to pay their respects - Burhan's teachers,
former classmates, amd neighbors.
   Atop the house and on a nearby roof, there were also two
outlawed Palestinian flags and strips of cloth covered with verses
from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   The crowd occasionally broke into nationalist songs: ``Palestine
needs men to become martyrs,'' and ``Palestine must return.''
   Kashour proudly recalled his son, an athlete who ``could jump
more than three meters high.'' Burhan, one of the family's seven
children, was never jailed during the 35-month-old Palestinian
uprising and planned to study art in the United States.
   ``Last time I saw him, it was 10 in the morning,'' Kashour said.
``Half an hour later, he was dead. He went to pray and was killed.
Now I go every day to pray on his blood.''
   Elsewhere in the Arab east Jerusalem on Saturday, police
arrested three schoolgirls and closed a school after several
stone-throwing incidents, officials said.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Aharon Elchayani said about 200 high
school girls demonstrated and threw stones at police near the
Mamuniye school. Police dispersed them by firing tear gas grenades,
and three of the girls were arrested, he said.
   Witnesses said that several girls lost consciousness after being
overcome by tear gas. Others ran into the St. George Hospital
nearby, and police were seen throwing tear gas grenades into the
hospital compound.
   It was the third day of scattered demonstrations in the annexed
eastern part of the city, which Israel captured from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war.
   The demonstrations were linked to the second anniversary
Thursday of the Palestinians' proclamation of ``independence'' in
the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   In the Gaza village of Abasan, Palestinian militants stabbed to
death Musa Ahmed Arafat, 45, after accusing him of assisting
Israel, Arab reports said.
   The death raised to 300 the number of Arabs slain by fellow
Palestinians as alleged collaborators with Israel. At least 773
Arabs have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the
revolt. Fifty-two Israelis have died in the violence.

   Several hundred protesters were arrested
Saturday in a second straight day of anti-abortion demonstrations
outside abortion clinics.
   Randall Terry, the head of Operation Rescue, was among those
detained and loaded into two police buses outside a clinic in
downtown Washington, witnesses said.
   Police had no immediate comment on the number taken into
custody, but a local TV station, WRC, said about 300 were arrested.
   On Friday 340 protesters were arrested as part of the two-day
campaign staged by Operation Rescue, a national anti-abortion
activist group.
   ``If we saved one baby today, we accomplished more than
anything,'' said Tom Hall of Buffalo, N.Y., a protester who was
arrested on Friday. He said those arrested were given citations
with $50 fines and released.
   Operation Rescue members said about 1,000 people from across the
country had come to Washington for the demonstrations. On Saturday
they demonstrated at three places, including the downtown clinic
and a Planned Parenthood office.
   All the arrests apparently took place outside the clinic, where
protesters sang hymns, waved banners and exchanged jeers with those
opposed to their cause.
   A group advocating abortion rights, the Washington Area Clinic
Defense Task Force, said some 500 people participated in a
counter-demonstration and joined efforts to ensure that women
wanting to enter the clinic would not be impeded.
   Karen Orlando, a member of the task force, said there was some
pushing between the two groups but no real trouble. She said three
abortion rights supporters were ``mistakenly'' arrested when they
were caught in a crowd being moved by police into the buses.
   She said the protesters were arrested for trying to block the
clinic's entrance, but Operation Rescue members claimed one of
their leaders, Pat Mahoney, was hauled off by police while he was
on his knees praying on a sidewalk across the street.
   Federal judges in the District of Columbia, Virginia and
Maryland have issued permanent injunctions against Operation
Rescue, Terry and several of its other leaders to prevent them from
blocking entrances or exits to clinics.

<HEAD>Angola's Ruling Party Announces Political Realignment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party has proposed a new
strategy of democratic socialism and economic reform, breaking with
15 years of Marxist rule.
   The central committee of the Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola announced the new strategy Friday night after a three-day
meeting.
   There was no immediate response from the rebels of UNITA - the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   The announcement came as a delegation from the government met in
Portugal with the U.S.-backed UNITA rebels for the latest round of
peace talks to end a 15-year-old civil war and prepare Angola's
transition to democracy.
   The talks, mediated by the Portuguese government, were private.
A Portuguese official said a statement would be released only after
the talks ended, probably Monday.
   The two sides have met five times in Portugal in the past eight
months.
   Friday's governing party statement said the party would work to
introduce a mixed economy in Angola, with protection for private
property and foreign investment.
   Sources close to the central committee said the declaration was
a compromise between party liberals and hard-liners.
   The governing party's rise to power after the collapse of
Portuguese colonial rule in Angola sparked a long conflict fueled
by heavy infusions of foreign weaponry.
   South Africa backed the UNITA rebels with troops and arms
against the Communist government, while Cuba sent about 50,000
troops to back the MPLA in the civil war.
   The United States and the Soviet Union sent arms to back their
allies in the war, which, according to government figures, has
killed more than 350,000 people.
   Under a 1988 peace accord, South Africa pledged to halt aid to
UNITA and Cuban troops began a pull out scheduled to end next
summer.
   However, heavy fighting has continued and both superpowers
maintain arms supplies to Angola.
   The governing party has recently announced its acceptance of
multiparty government. Last month, President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos said opposition parties could be legalized early next year
and elections held within three years of a cease-fire.
   The UNITA rebels are demanding further political guarantees and
want elections before December 1991.

<HEAD>State To Gun Dealer: `You Don't Have To Sell Him the Gun'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL CERRITO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state Department of Justice official
who refused to block the sale of a gun later used in a fatal night
of terror in a Berkeley barroom says the gun dealer didn't have to
sell the weapon.
   The dealer says he did.
   The department's statements followed remarks by Bob Weaver of El
Cerrito's Old West Gun Room on Friday that the department told him
``there was nothing they could do'' to keep the gun from Mehrdad
Dashti, a one-time mental patient.
   Dashti's Sept. 27 rampage killed John Sheehy, 22, and wounded
nine other University of California students before police stormed
Henry's Publick House &amp; Grille at the Durant Hotel, freed the
hostages and shot the gunman to death.
   Bob Drake, chief of the Justice Department's Division of Law
Enforcement, said Weaver had called the department saying, ``I
think we have a mental here.''
   Drake said his people checked with the state Department of
Mental Health ``and his name wasn't there.''
   ``I don't like to be nasty to him (Weaver) but we advised him,
`Look, you don't have to sell him the gun. It's your choice,'''
Drake said.
   The Justice Department has no authority to deny the sale of a
gun to an individual without lawful evidence, Drake said.
   Weaver, told of Drake's remarks, said, ``I didn't want to get
sued ... I could get sued for prejudice, for discrimination against
the man I didn't sell to. I didn't have any proof that he was a
mental patient. What more could I do?''
   During the state-mandated 15-day waiting period in handgun
sales, an acquaintance of Dashti's came in to Weaver's shop and
warned him of Dashti's mental problems.
   Weaver said he partially disabled the safety on the Ruger before
first handing it over. Dashti quickly returned it, and Weaver faked
a return to the manufacturer ostensibly to get it repaired, then
handed it over when the Justice Department declined to block the
sale.
   The police records backed Weaver's story, saying that all
through the waiting period, ``Weaver had the gun in the store, but
was very reluctant to release it to Dashti.''
   Although Dashti got into minor trouble with the law and had been
a patient at the Berkeley Mental Health Clinic, it was legal for
him to buy handguns. Alameda County authorities had assessed Dashti
as a paranoid schizophrenic.

   About 300 nationalist
activists jeered and threw stones Saturday at a speaker addressing
some 30,000 Slovaks gathered to celebrate the first anniversary of
communism's downfall in Czechoslovakia.
   The small group of activists surrounded the speaker's rostrum on
Bratislava's National Uprising Square and began whistling and
throwing stones as former dissident Miroslav Kusy addressed the
rally celebrating last year's ``Velvet Revolution'' that ended four
decades of communist rule.
   The nationalists waved banners reading ``Independent Slovakia''
and ``Prague go home'' at the rally called by Public Against
Violence, leading party in Slovakia's coalition government and
sister movement to Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel's Civic
Forum.
   Slovak nationalism, suppressed under the communists, has been
rising since last November. Radicals are not satisfied with federal
government moves to devolve more powers to both Czech and Slovak
republics.
   Kusy, a prominent philosopher and rector of Bratislava's
Komensky University, was visibly shaken as he ducked flying stones
and he called on the crowd for support.
   The crowds responded by falling silent. Police at the edge of
the square could not intervene. There were no clashes between the
two groups of demonstrators.
   The marred rally contrasted with the enthusiastic anniversary
celebrations in Prague, where tens of thousands packed central
Wenceslas Square to cheer President Bush for standing by their
fledgling democracy.
   The nationalists began protesting after Kusy criticized Slovak
separatists, saying they should ``decide for nonviolence, peace and
legal means.''
   He urged ``positive relations'' between all nationalities in
Slovakia, saying special respect should be shown for the region's
600,000 minority Hungarians.
   Calls have become more strident recently for Slovak secession
from the Czechoslovak federation formed in 1918, disbanded by the
Nazis and forcibly reformed by the communists in 1968.
   Nationalist radicals were outraged last month when Slovakia's
parliament passed a law allowing ethnic Hungarians to use their
language officially in areas where they make up 20 percent of the
population.
   Angry protesters marched through Bratislava, calling for a
tougher law and demanding the government's resignation, and 25
nationalists began a hunger strike in protest.

<DATELINE>SOMERS, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless man convicted of murder is
appealing his case to the state Supreme Court, arguing his
constitutional rights were violated when police searched his
makeshift home beneath an interstate highway.
   David Mooney's case, which the court is expected to decide soon,
raises for the first time in Connecticut the question of whether
the privacy of homeless people is protected by the Fourth
Amendment.
   The Fourth Amendment protects the rights of individuals ``to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures.''
   Mooney, now serving a 50-year sentence at Somers state prison,
contends the search was unreasonable because police did not have a
search warrant, which they would have needed to search a more
traditional residence.
   Mooney was homeless and living beneath Interstate 91 in New
Haven for a brief period in the summer of 1987, when police were
investigating the strangulation death of Theodore Genovese, a
48-year-old hospital worker in New Haven.
   Another suspect in the case implicated Mooney, charging that he
and Mooney went to visit Genovese, ostensibly for a homosexual
liaison, but in fact to rob him. Mooney has denied any involvement
in the crime.
   After Mooney was picked up for questioning by New Haven police,
his girlfriend led police on a search of the spot beneath the
highway where he kept his belongings and slept.
   In a cardboard box, police found a 38-inch belt matching the
waist size of the victim. In a duffel bag, they found a pair of
bloody trousers.
   Mooney failed in various motions to have the evidence
suppressed, and was convicted in March 1989 of felony murder and
robbery.
   Mooney's appeal raises several questions: What constitutes a
``home,'' and how much privacy can the homeless expect?
   ``I didn't feel homeless,'' Mooney said in a newspaper
interview. ``I felt at home. I felt more at home than when I had an
apartment.''
   Robert M. Hayes, an authority on the legal rights of the
homeless, said Mooney's position is ``legally right.'' He noted
that a federal judge in New York ruled last year that, for the
purposes of voter registration, a park bench could be considered a
home.
   But he added, ``It's a miserable, wretched right to win. It
suggests a social acceptance of homelessness as a fact of life,
which should be resisted to the grave.''
   In opposing Mooney's appeal, Assistant State's Attorney Judith
Rossi argued that Mooney ``was not legitimately residing at the
bridge abutment, as he himself realized.''
   ``The defendant's decision to `reside' at the bridge abutment
does not change either his status as an interloper or the public,
i.e. open, nature of the land,'' she said.
   Last year, Superior Court Judge Joseph J. Purtill ruled that
police had a ``perfect right'' to search Mooney's makeshift home
without a warrant.
   ``I have serious questions as to whether or not the Fourth
Amendment was ever intended to protect people's rights in such a
location,'' he ruled.
   But Emanuel Margolis, the chairman of the Connecticut Civil
Liberties Union and Mooney's public defender, said times have
changed, and the law must change as well.
   ``This is not some isolated case of a trespasser who comes,
without permission, upon a bridge abutment and says `I'm going to
be a squatter,'' he argued before the state Supreme Court. ``We
have thousands and thousands of homeless in Connecticut.''

<HEAD>Opposition Agrees to End Boycott Of Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's political leaders
reached an agreement Saturday that clears the way for two
opposition parties to end their four-month boycott of parliament.
   The floor leaders of the governing party and the opposition held
a joint news conference, saying they had agreed to hold local
assembly elections in the first half of next year. Mayoral and
gubernatorial elections will be held a year later.
   Differences over the timing of the elections, and the
opposition's demand for greater local autonomy in communities, were
some of the key issues of the opposition's boycott.
   ``The agreement obviously is not the best, but it will ensure
progress in our political system, for which we made concession,''
said Rep. Kim Hyung-bae, floor leader of the Party for Peace and
Democracy, the largest opposition party.
   ``This cleared all issues standing in the way of political
normalization,'' said Rep. Kim Yoon-hwan, of the governing
Democratic Liberal Party.
   All 78 opposition legislators in the 299-member assembly,
including 70 from Peace and Democracy and eight from the Democratic
Party, resigned in July. They accused the governing party of
railroading controversial bills and backsliding on political
reforms.
   The opposition set forth several preconditions to ending their
boycott. They included early local elections and cancellation of
plans to change South Korea's system of government from
presidential to parliamentary.
   Korean President Roh Tae-woo and other leaders had been seeking
a parliamentary system similar to Japan's government, wherein
parliament would elect a prime minister to serve as a head of
state.
   The opposition's demand was met this month when a faction within
Roh's party rejected the change of government proposal. Roh then
backed down and promised not to seek a constitutional revision.

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sent
Congress a police reform bill that could curtail torture and
threats against prisoners in custody.
   The proposed legislation was delivered by the president over the
weekend. It should pass easily, since the Congress is dominated by
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   According to the government news agency Notimex, the reform
would limit police search rights, oblige police to obtain court
warrants and stipulate that confessions be made openly before a
judge or district attorney.
   Confessions to police or other law enforcement officers will not
be valid under the proposed reform. The purpose of this provision
is to stop the widespread practice of eliciting confessions through
threats and torture.
   Human rights groups have long complained that suspects are
mistreated by police, especially in drug- or political-related
cases.
   The legislation applies to federal law, but each of the 31
states and the Federal District are expected to eventually include
it in their codes of procedures.
   The reform follows a shake-up in the Attorney General's Office.
   Javier Coello Trejo, the powerful assistant attorney general in
charge of drug enforcement, was transferred in October to head a
consumer protection agency. His old job was downgraded and filled
by an army colonel.

<HEAD>U.N. Food Agency Announces Record Harvest in 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in years, the 1990-91 global
cereal harvest will be sufficient to meet world consumption needs,
a U.N. agency announced Saturday.
   However, food shortages are worsening in Ethiopia, Sudan, and
Angola, where rains have been scarce or late, said the report from
the Rome-based U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
   The lack of food remains a serious problem in war-damaged
Mozambique and Liberia, said the report.
   It also said cereal production and per capita consumption would
continue to decline in South America.
   In its periodical ``Food Outlook,'' the FAO said that world
cereal output for 1990-91 would reach a record 1.95 billion tons in
the harvest, about 75 million more than the previous year.
   FAO also forecasted an increase in the world carryover of cereal
stocks at the end of the 1990-91 crop year to 18 percent of
expected use for the next year. FAO considers a 17 to 18 percent
carryover the minimum necessary to protect world food security.
   Stocks of both wheat and rice are expected to increase, the
report said.
   The crop of pulses - peas, lentils and the like - is estimated
to reach a record 60 million tons, a 2 million ton increase
compared with last year, the agency said.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges To Stand with Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush told a crowd that
filled historic Wenceslas Square on Saturday that ``America will
stand with you'' through hard times ahead and he urged European
solidarity in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Visiting Prague on the anniversary of the revolution that ended
decades of communist rule in Czechoslovakia, Bush also said new
European security arrangements might be needed to make sure the
former Soviet allies do not wind up in ``some kind of no man's
land.''
   In his speech, Bush likened last year's struggle of emerging
democracies against totalitarianism to the current U.S.-led effort
to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.
   ``The darkness in the desert sky cannot stand against the way of
light,'' Bush said, addressing about 100,000 people who packed the
half-mile long, 200-foot wide ``square'' that is the scene of much
recent Czechoslovak history.
   The first U.S. president ever to visit this central European
nation, Bush shared the platform with playwright-president Vaclav
Havel. Those in the crowd waved small U.S. and Czechoslovak flags
and many chanted ``Bush, Havel. Bush, Havel.''
   After their speeches, the two presidents stepped out from their
bulletproof enclosure and climbed a wooden platform and joined a
folk band that sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' first in English and
then in Czech.
   Many in the crowd joined along, filling the cold and overcast
late afternoon sky with the traditional song that was both a
protest anthem for the U.S. and civil rights movements of the 1960s
and for Czechoslovak students in street protests here against
communist rule.
   A year ago, the square was similarly filled with hundreds of
thousands of citizens to begin the so-called ``Velvet Revolution''
that drove communists from power with little bloodshed.
   ``The world will never forget what happened here in this square
where the history of freedom was written,'' Bush said.
   He praised Czechoslovakia as ``one of the first nations to
condemn the outrage in the Persian Gulf.''
   Havel reiterated this view and promised Bush continued support
during a joint news conference outside the Hradcany Castle, the
Czechoslovak equivalent of the White House.
   Havel shrugged off a question on whether he was concerned that
the Persian Gulf crisis was draining away money that could have
been used to help support his country's ailing economy.
   ``It is my opinion that all the resources that are expended on
resisting aggression anywhere in the world are finally turned to
the good of all mankind,'' he said.
   Bush was expected to try to further coordinate allied support in
Germany on Sunday, where he visits Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and in
Paris where he attends a three-day European summit.
   At the news conference, Bush was asked if he and Havel discussed
future security arrangements for Europe in the aftermath of the
cold war and the crumbling of the Warsaw Pact.
   ``We do not want to see Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary off
in some kind of no man's land,'' Bush said. ``Thus, we did discuss
future security arrangements.''
   While he did not elaborate, Bush said he wanted to see a more
active role played by the 34-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the group sponsoring the Paris meeting.
Future alignments in Europe are expected to be high on the agenda
of that session. Bush said the United States has ``an enormous
stake'' in the security of Eastern Europe.
   Both in his Wenceslas Square speech and in an earlier address to
the Federal Assembly, the nation's parliament, Bush offered hope of
new U.S. economic assistance to the fledgling democracy.
   ``We know this is a difficult time for you, but also a time of
extraordinary optimism,'' he told the crowd in the square, winning
loud applause. ``America will not fail you in this decisive moment.
America will stand with you,''
   Earlier, he said final agreement was reached Saturday granting
Czechoslovakia most-favored-nation trade status, permitting it to
deal with the United States at the lowest possible tariffs and
import fee rates.
   Bush said he also would ask Congress for $60 million to create a
fund to spur U.S. investment here. Moreover, Bush said funds to
help build the private sector would be drawn from the $370 million
already committed for Central and Eastern Europe for the coming
year.
   The two leaders were wrapped in heavy topcoats against the
biting wind in Wenceslas Square. Earlier, Bush and his wife Barbara
emerged from Air Force One to a full-fledged state welcome,
including a 21-gun salute as flags of both nations snapped in the
wind.
   Bush was to spend Thanksgiving with U.S. forces in the Persian
Gulf region and then end his eight-day trip next Friday with a
visit to Egypt for talks on the showdown with Iraq.
   Administration officials accompanying Bush said the United
States soon would ask Moscow, Iraq's former chief arms supplier,
whether it had supplied medium-range SS-12 missiles to Baghdad in
the past.
   Such weapons could be capable of carrying chemical warheads.
Moscow, under a treaty with the United States, was required to
destroy these missiles.
   ``We are going to the Soviets'' on the matter because of recent
reports on the possibility, said an administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush meets separately on Tuesday in Paris with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   In his Wenceslas Square speech, Bush presented Havel with a
replica of the Liberty Bell that hangs in Philadelphia to ``help
you proclaim your new liberty throughout the world.''
   He also promised to take steps to return to the country a
70-year-old draft of a proposed Czechoslovakia Declaration of
Independence that is in the Library of Congress in Washington. The
draft was presented to President Woodrow Wilson by Tomas Masaryk,
Czechoslovakia's first president.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday
proposed dumping his embattled prime minister and giving himself
more power to break a political deadlock and swiftly introduce an
emergency food program.
   Losing popularity and power in his centrist position following a
lackluster speech to the Supreme Soviet legislature Friday,
Gorbachev came out fighting Saturday. In a 12-minute address packed
with new proposals, he urged lawmakers to approve a radical
reorganization of the executive branch that would put it entirely
under his control.
   Although representatives of several restive republics vowed not
to cooperate with the new government, the legislature voted
overwhelmingly to give the program preliminary approval. They voted
316-19, with 31 abstentions, to send the proposals to committees to
consider amendments and discuss a final draft Friday.
   Gorbachev's suggestions appeared to be a concession to his main
rival and critic, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who on Friday
had demanded a coalition government and the resignation of Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Under Gorbachev's proposals Saturday, the Council of Ministers
headed by Ryzhkov would be replaced by several bodies under direct
presidential control. The principal governing body would be the
Federation Council, created in March as a presidential advisory
body but which would now be made the highest body of state power
and include representatives of the Soviet republics.
   The proposals represent Gorbachev's attempt to resolve the
paralysis of power between the 15 republics and the central
government that has blocked economic and political reforms for
months.
   He also proposed an ``inter-republican committee'' under the
Federation Council, a National Security Council and a presidential
body to coordinate the activities of law enforcement agencies.
   On the food crisis, Gorbachev promised emergency measures in two
weeks for supplying this year's produce to the population. Ryzhkov
said this program involves increasing food imports, a Yeltsin
suggestion.
   Apparently overwhelmed by his two jobs of president and
Communist Party leader, Gorbachev also suggested naming a vice
president.
   It was the third time this year Gorbachev asked Soviet lawmakers
to give him more power. In March, he received the powers of an
executive president, including the authority to impose direct
presidential rule in restive areas. In September, he was empowered
to issue decrees to make economic reforms and restore law and
order.
   A group of 235 former Communist Party members met Saturday to
form the Republican Party of Russia, which they said would be a
left-center coalition supporting cooperation between Gorbachev and
Yeltsin.
   The nucleus of the party is members of Democratic Platform, a
popular faction of reform-minded former Communists who have
included Yeltsin and the reform mayors of Moscow and Leningrad,
Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak.
   Party leaders said the group had about 1,000 supporters in
Moscow and small pockets in other Russian cities. It is strongest
among the intelligentsia.
   Reacting to Gorbachev's latest proposals, some legislators said
Gorbachev was trying to grab too much authority.
   ``It is concentrating all power in the economy, in politics, in
military affairs in one (person's) hands,'' Marju Lauristin, deputy
speaker of Estonia's parliament, told reporters.
   Legislators generally welcomed the proposed elimination of
Ryzhkov's job, but unless all the republics agree to join the
Federation Council, the paralysis of power is likely to continue.
   Many republics have nullified national legislation and
presidential decrees and declared their laws supreme. The new
structure was designed to end such conflicts.
   Ms. Lauristin said Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania wanted no part
of the new structure, and Georgian, Ukrainian and Armenian
representatives said they are not ready to sign a treaty binding
their republics in a union.
   The Baltic states have said their incorporation into the Soviet
Union in 1940 was illegal and invalid and have launched
independence drives. All but one of the other republics, Kirghizia,
have declared sovereignty to break from the Kremlin.
   The chairman of Russia's economic council, Mikhail Bocharov,
called the proposals ``unrealistic'' because they do not give the
republics full independence.
   While acknowledging the powers of the republics and the central
government must be redefined, Gorbachev reiterated in his speech
his opposition to attempts to break up the union.
   ``It is easier for me to say this now: our own bitter experience
tinged with the blood of our citizens has, I think, taught us that
we cannot separate,'' Gorbachev said, prompting applause.
   After months of defending Ryzhkov and claiming critics were
making him a scapegoat, Gorbachev let Ryzhkov go subtly. He did not
mention Ryzhkov's name or specifically call for abolition of the
Council of Ministers in his speech.
   He referred only to creation of a new ``Cabinet of Ministers.''
   Deputies said it was unclear whether the Cabinet of Ministers or
the Federation Council would serve as a Western-style presidential
Cabinet.
   Instead of abolishing the Council of Ministers and antagonizing
bureaucrats, Gorbachev displayed his political skill by proposing
their power be taken away. In March, he did the same thing to the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo, giving many of its powers to an
advisory body, the Presidential Council.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev proposed abolishing the 18-member
Presidential Council and giving its functions to the strengthened
Federation Council.
   ``Anything affecting the entire country, whether decided by the
center or republics, must be discussed and given the go-ahead by
the Federation Council,'' he proposed.
   Ryzhkov, a confidant of Gorbachev for a decade, said he believed
he would be out of a job.
   ``I understood that the position of chairman of the Council of
Ministers won't exist. There will be presidential rule, a
presidential Cabinet,'' the weary 61-year-old prime minister told
reporters.
   Yeltsin has seen Ryzhkov and his associates as the embodiment of
the old rule-by-command central bureaucracy. Reformers say the
central bureaucracy is inefficient and corrupt, and should be
replaced with democratic, free market institutions.
   The Federation Council could be Gorbachev's answer to Yeltsin's
proposal Friday of an ``extraordinary anti-crisis committee,'' with
representatives of all republics and concentrating on providing
food to the people.
   Yeltsin did not attend Saturday's session and his press
secretary said he would not comment immediately on Gorbachev's
proposals.

   A woman whose exploits in the French
underground saved 32 American fliers from the Nazis during World
War II was eulogized Saturday by two of the airmen whom she tracked
down more than 40 years later.
   Charline Chable Rotondo died Thursday at Concord Hospital of
lung cancer at age 78. She was the first foreign-born woman to
receive the Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor.
Gen. Dwight Eisenhower presented her the medal in Paris in 1945
after her escape from the Germans.
   ``She was very good to us,'' said Alvin Little of Burlington,
Vt., who was an injured pilot Mrs. Rotondo hustled out one door as
the Germans came in another. ``She did everything in her power to
get us through.''
   Little, the last man the French-born woman smuggled through her
house, recalled how she burst in to tell him the Germans were
coming.
   ``She came in one evening and said, `We've got to go. We've got
to get out of here,''' Little said in a telephone interview. ``They
were right there, ready to come in.''
   While Mrs. Rotondo stalled the Germans, Little and her niece got
out another door, he said. She escaped, too.
   Mrs. Rotondo was captured later, but she refused to reveal
information about the French Resistance even though the Germans
beat and otherwise tortured her. She escaped when the Allies bombed
a train carrying her to a concentration camp.
   Little, 71, stayed at Mrs. Rotondo's home in Esbly, some 20
miles east of Paris, for three months nursing a broken leg. He said
he and the other pilots owed their lives to her and the
underground.
   ``But she went through a lifetime of hell doing it,'' he said.
   Mrs. Rotondo's husband, Alfred, said that after she moved to the
United States in 1974, she tried to find the men she had helped
save.
   ``She was forever looking for these guys,'' Rotondo said
Saturday. ``For 10 years I listened to her say `If I could only
find one.'''
   Finally, word of her search reached the Air Force Escape and
Evasion Society, a group of escaped prisoners and fliers who had
evaded capture.
   Through those groups, in 1984 she found former flier John
Swensen, who lived about 40 minutes from her in Newton, Mass.
   Rotondo said that when his wife and Swensen met, ``she was as
happy as could be. Tears were running down their faces.'' They
later got together frequently.
   ``She remembered me as the man with the big feet,'' Swensen said
Saturday. He wore about a size 13 boot.
   Swensen stayed in Mrs. Rotondo's home about a week before moving
on.
   After the war, Mrs. Rotondo became a fashion designer. She lived
in Cambodia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Taiwan, before moving to the
United States.
   Most recently she lived in Salem, N.H., designing clothes,
driving a bus for the handicapped and working for a home care
nursing company in northern Massachusetts.
   Funeral services will take place Monday in Salem.
   Along with her husband, she is survived by a stepson and two
stepdaugthers.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Saturday it has begun
notifying some store office workers they'll either be transferred
or fired after New Year's Day.
   The affected employees are an undetermined number among the
estimated 20,000 people who work in areas including customer
service, accounting and payroll in the 850 Sears stores across the
nation, spokesman Gerald Buldak said.
   ``It's really too soon to tell'' how many employees will be
affected, but most work part-time, Buldak said.
   He said some staff functions will be merged at a hub office in
some stores.
   ``Employees displaced would have an opportunity to work
elsewhere in a store, if a job existed, or would not have a job,''
he said.
   Last fall, the company began seeking ways to improve customer
service and cut costs, Buldak said. Using employee ideas, Sears
tested pared-down procedures at 10 stores, he said.
   Te company began notifying workers late last week that they
could be either transferred or lose their jobs through a nationwide
cost-cutting effort, Buldak said.
   Last month, Sears reported sharply lower net income for the
third straight quarter, with overall earnings down 30 percent, but
said its retail unit had improved.
   The retail group, called the Sears Merchandise Group, accounts
for more than half of all company revenues. It posted a 7.6 percent
gain in third-quarter operating income after suffering a 32 percent
decline in the second quarter and a $37.4 million loss in the
first.
   The merchandise groups includes 337,000 employees, which
includes both store and catalogue sales.

   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, in his
first national address since taking office, appealed Saturday for
an end to the religious and sectarian battles that brought down his
successor.
   ``The age of confrontation should be changed in the age of
understanding, compassion and cordiality,'' Chandra Shekhar said in
a broadcast on state-run television and radio.
   Chandra Shekhar, who replaced V.P. Singh on Nov. 10, promised to
``bring this country out of a muddy mire of misery and
misfortune.'' It was a virtual duplication of a speech he gave
Friday in Parliament, when his government won a vote of confidence.
   Hours before his broadcast, Sikh militants killed 10 Hindus in
the northern state of Punjab. Press Trust of India said 30 other
people were killed in Punjab Friday.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 to set up an
independent nation in Punjab. About 2,800 people have been killed
in the northern state this year. Thousands more have been killed in
separatist insurrections in Kashmir, in the far north, and Assam in
the east.
   A new Hindu-Moslem conflict, which led to the collapse of
Singh's government, has left at least 500 people dead across the
country in the last two months.
   These problems have to be ``tackled with a sense of
reconciliation,'' Chandra Shekhar said. ``I humbly appeal to the
young men to give up violence and come to the mainstream.''
   The Hindu-Moslem clashes came about as a result of a Hindu
fundamentalist group's plan to replace a Moslem mosque with a
temple in the city of Ayodhya. Singh opposed the plan, thereby
losing the support of a key right-wing Hindu party.
   ``Hindu religion has always pleaded for human approach to all
problems. Any killing in the name of religion is criminal,''
Chandra Shekhar said.
   He said the violence was sapping the government's efforts to
fight poverty. India is one of the poorest nations in the world,
with an annual per capita income of $330.
   Annual inflation is officially running at a projected rate of 10
percent. Some recent surveys showed that in rural areas, the daily
cost of food has shot up by 25 percent since July.
   Chandra Shekhar is the leader of the Janata Dal-Socialist party,
which controls only 56 of the 522 seats in Parliament.
   With the backing of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
Congress Party, which has 210 seats, the new government was
confirmed by a 280-214 vote Friday. Fifteen legislators abstained
and the rest were absent.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Saturday shot tear gas at more than
200 youths who hurled firebombs and rocks at the Hilton Hotel near
the U.S. Embassy.
   Two policemen was slightly injured during running battles with
the self-styled anarchists who rampaged through downtown Athens.
Damage to buildings was slight, police said.
   The violence came at the end of an annual march to commemorate a
student uprising against the 1967-74 military dictatorship.
   The club-wielding youths firebombed a police bus, a bank, and
offices of the governing New Democracy party, police said. They
also hurled rocks at the War Museum, a Finance Ministry building, a
cinema and shops.
   The youths, who earlier appeared to be headed for the U.S.
Embassy where the march ended, dispersed after the Hilton incident,
police said.
   Many of the attacks occurred near the Athens Polytechnic, or
National Technical University, where the annual march began.
   The Polytechnic was the site of the Nov. 17, 1973, uprising that
paved the way for the collapse of the military regime. More than 20
young people were killed as troops and tanks were deployed to oust
protestors occupying the building.
   The marchers file past the U.S. Embassy each year to protest
alleged backing by Washington for the ruling colonels of that time.
   In Saturday's demonstration, protesters chanted anti-government
slogans. Police estimated turnout at about 8,000 protesters,
thousands lower than in previous years.
   Clashes between self-styled anarchists and supporters of the
governing conservative party's youth movement broke out in the
Polytechnic's compound on Friday. Ten injuries were reported.
   Premier Constantine Mitsotakis, whose party came to power April
8, has been the target of left-wing criticism for his decision to
dispatch a frigate to the Persian Gulf region to help enforce U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
   Mitsotakis has also drawn left-wing fire for economic
belt-tightening measures and a new electoral law that makes it
harder for smaller political parties to win representation in
parliament.

   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, in his
first national address since taking office, appealed Saturday for
an end to the religious and sectarian battles that brought down his
successor.
   ``The age of confrontation should be changed in the age of
understanding, compassion and cordiality,'' Chandra Shekhar said in
a broadcast on state-run television and radio.
   Chandra Shekhar, who replaced V.P. Singh on Nov. 10, promised to
``bring this country out of a muddy mire of misery and
misfortune.'' It was a virtual duplication of a speech he gave
Friday in Parliament, when his government won a vote of confidence.
   Hours before his broadcast, Sikh militants killed 10 Hindus in
the northern state of Punjab. Press Trust of India said 30 other
people were killed in Punjab Friday.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 to set up an
independent nation in Punjab. About 2,800 people have been killed
in the northern state this year. Thousands more have been killed in
separatist insurrections in Kashmir, in the far north, and Assam in
the east.
   A new Hindu-Moslem conflict, which led to the collapse of
Singh's government, has left at least 500 people dead across the
country in the last two months.
   These problems have to be ``tackled with a sense of
reconciliation,'' Chandra Shekhar said. ``I humbly appeal to the
young men to give up violence and come to the mainstream.''
   The Hindu-Moslem clashes came about as a result of a Hindu
fundamentalist group's plan to replace a Moslem mosque with a
temple in the city of Ayodhya. Singh opposed the plan, thereby
losing the support of a key right-wing Hindu party.
   ``Hindu religion has always pleaded for human approach to all

Chandra Shekhar said.
   He said the violence was sapping the government's efforts to

   A bomb hidden inside a softball bat
exploded Saturday during a U.S.-Chile game, killing a Canadian and
injuring three people, including two American Embassy
representatives, officials reported.
   A man claiming to speak for the Chilean branch of the Palestine
Liberation Organization claimed responsibility for the blast in a
telephone call to a radio station. The caller warned President Bush
not to visit Chile, as he plans to do during a South American tour
Dec. 2-8.
   However, a spokesman for the PLO's office in Santiago denied the
group was responsible for the bombing. ``We completely,
emphatically deny that the PLO acted in the attack,'' he said,
refusing to give his name.
   The attack, the second on Americans in Chile in two weeks,
occurred during a game at the National Stadium between teams from
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a Chilean university.
   Police said the softball bat was stuffed with nearly a pound of
dynamite and exploded in the dugout of the chamber team. The blast
killed James Thomas, 36, an executive with a Canadian firm
exporting seafood from Chile, they said.
   The game's umpire, Vicente Alcayaga, said at least two other
people were wounded, including Thomas Collins, ``a security officer
in the American embassy.''
   Barbara Nielsen, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, wouldnot confirm
Collins' job. She said: ``he is relatively new here, and I don't
know his hometown in the United States or other details at this
point.''
   She said Collins, 28, was ``in serious condition.''
   Later, a spokesman for the National Police Hospital, where
Collins was taken, confirmed he was in serious condition, but said
his life was not in danger. Collins sustained multiple face and
body injuries, he said.
   A second wounded man was identified only as J. Gain, apparently
a Canadian.
   The hospital spokesman, Dr. Jaime Baltra, said a second U.S.
Embassy official, Jeff Tickeney, suffered minor scratches on both
legs and was treated and released. His position with the embassy
also was not immediately available.
   Police said that the game was nearing its end shortly after noon
when the bomb went off. They said another game had been scheduled
to start afterward, also involving Americans and Canadians.
   About two hours after the blast, a man speaking with a foreign
accent called Radio Monumental in Santiago saying the PLO was
responsible for the attack.
   The man read a communique saying the bomb was planted ``to mark
the second anniversary of the Palestinian state in exile due to the
Zionist occupation with the help of the American imperialism.''
   ``We want you to know that the PLO has international force,''
the man said. ``We will fight against Zionist and American targets
so that our next anniversary be celebrated in our Palestinian
land.''
   ``This is just an ancitipation of what will happen if American
dictator George Bush sets foot on Chile, a motherland we love and
respect,'' the statement said.
   Police did not immediately comment on the claim.
   Nov. 15th marked the second anniversary of the Palestine
declaration of an independent homeland in Israeli-occupied
territory.
   Sergio Brotfeld, deputy director of the government's sports
agency, said the Canadian executive had been in Chile for only two
weeks.
   The chamber's team was made up mostly of Americans and
Canadians. There were also several foreigners among the small crowd
watching the game.
   On Nov. 4, a bomb exploded in a restaurant in the seaside resort
of Vina del Mar, injuring eight people, including three sailors
from the U.S. aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. No group claimed
responsibility in that bombing.
   Since President Patricio Aylwin took office in March, ending 17
years of military rule, there have been several bombing attacks,
mostly attributed to the far-left Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front.
   The National Stadium was used as a detention center for
thousands of suspected supporters of former President Salvador
Allende after he was deposed in a military coup in 1973.

   Indicted savings and loan executive Charles H.
Keating Jr. wants to testify before a committee investigating five
senators but only if granted immunity from prosecution, one of his
attorneys says.
   ``My client's testimony might help some senators, it might hurt
others,'' attorney Stephen C. Neal of Chicago said in a letter to
Senate Ethics Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett.
   Neal, however, said Keating could not testify if his words might
be used against him at a future trial.
   ``Because of pending criminal investigations Mr. Keating's story
cannot be heard at all,'' the letter said. ``The committee can and
should immunize Mr. Keating and free him to testify.''
   The Nov. 12 letter was made available to news media Saturday,
two days after the start of hearings at which four of the senators
denied wrongdoing in the case.
   Under investigation by the committee are Sens. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
   Cranston, Riegle, Glenn and McCain read opening statements to
the committee on Friday and DeConcini is expected to deliver his
opening statement on Monday.
   The five senators are accused of interceding with federal
regulators on behalf of Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Irvine, Calif., while also accepting at total of
$1.3 million in political donations from Keating and his
associates.
   Lincoln's collapse in April 1989 is expected to cost taxpayers
up to $2 billion, according to federal regulators.
   Keating is under indictment in California for securities fraud
involving the sale of bonds by American Continental Corp., the
holding company that controlled Lincoln Savings.
   He also is threatened with federal indictment involving Lincoln
and the campaign contributions, according to Neal. The attorney
said that ``immunizing Mr. Keating to testify might impact some
threatened collateral legal proceedings.''
   ``But the committee should weigh and balance the public interest
in a full, complete, open and fair proceeding against the value of
any threatened criminal prosecution of my client for his part with
the five senators,'' Neal said in his letter to Bennett. ``The
American public has a right to know the full story of these
senators and their dealings with my client.''
   A source close to Keating, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Saturday there has been no reply to the letter.

<TEXT>
   An alleged drug smuggler put out a
$100,000 contract on a villager who dug up part of $43 million in
cash that traffickers buried in barrels on a farm, according to
prosecutors.
   The evidence of the contract was heard on a wiretap recording
played by prosecutors at a bail hearing for Wilfredo Gutierrez
Vargas, one of 21 people arrested in Puerto Rico and New York on
drug charges.
   The alleged leader of the ring, Ramon Torres Gonzalez, owned a
farm 35 miles west of San Juan on which $43 million in alleged drug
profits had been buried in 22 plastic barrels.
   Local residents found the cache last spring and spent about $11
million before Torres learned what was happening and hid the rest.
Neither Torres nor the remainder of the cash has been found.
   In the Sept. 4 recording, played Friday before U.S. Magistrate
Jesus Castellanos, the voice alleged to be that of Gutierrez tells
a government informant that he has hired a ``lowlife'' gunman to
kill Rene Feliciano Pagan, one of the people who supposedly dug up
the money.
   Pagan was later kidnapped. but police rescued him. It wasn't
known if anyone was charged in the kidnapping.
   Gutierrez, who owns an auto alarm business, and 29 other people
are charged in a 27-count indictment with engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise and conspiracy to import and distribute
controlled substances. Torres and eight other alleged members of
the gang are still at large.
   According to the indictment, the smugglers brought 4.5 tons of
cocaine into Puerto Rico and the United States since 1985.
   The villagers found the cash in $10, $20 and $100 bills and kept
their windfall secret for weeks. They put some of the money into
bank accounts and bought everything from VCRs to expensive cars
before authorities stepped in.
   The FBI says it confiscated $4.5 million in cash and property
bought with the stolen money. None of the residents were arrested.

<TEXT>
   Protesters rallied in Sofia and other
major cities Saturday, some demanding the resignation of Socialist
Premier Andrei Lukanov and others opposing restoration of rights to
ethnic Turks.
   Also, hundreds of women staged a ``hunger march'' late Friday
through the capital, banging empty pots with spoons to protest bare
stores and rations of basic goods, including some foods,
electricity and gasoline.
   Lukanov, whose Socialist government is under growing pressure
because of the Balkan country's economic crisis, has been pushing
for support in parliament for economic reforms.
   The reforms would slash state spending but would bring more
hardship for Bulgaria's already desperate consumers.
   President Zhelyu Zhelev, in a nationally televised address
Saturday, warned that rising political tensions could lead to
violence, and appealed to groups and individuals to ``assume social
and personal responsibility'' for their actions.
   ``No act of force, no violation of the law, no provocation
should occur that would compromise us in the eyes of Europe and the
world,'' said Zhelev, who has been trying to rally Western aid and
support for Bulgaria's ailing economy.
   Zhelev, a former opposition leader, said he had asked leaders of
all political parties to meet and try to resolve differences on
Wednesday, when he and Lukanov return from a 34-nation summit in
Paris.
   On Saturday, several thousand people gathered in front of the
Alexander Nevsky cathedral in central Sofia, cheering as speakers
urged support for ``all actions that will lead to the fall of the
government.''
   The rally was organized by university teachers, intellectuals
and parents who support a student strike at most high schools and
universities nationwide.
   State radio reported the main opposition coalition, the Union of
Democratic Forces, organized anti-government rallies in several
other towns and cities.
   Lukanov's Socialists, formerly the Communists, won 211
parliamentary seats in June elections, compared to 144 for the
Union, and formed a single-party government after the opposition
rejected a coalition. But Lukanov's popularity has slumped with the
economy's poor performance.
   National leaders agreed Friday to postpone a vote on Lukanov's
program in the 400-seat Grand National Assembly until Thursday.
   Deputies on Thursday approved overwhelmingly an amendment to
restore rights to Bulgaria's 1.5 million ethnic Turks and Moslems.
That sparked protests among Bulgarians in Turkish-dominated
regions.
   Under the amendment, Turks need no longer use Bulgarian names
imposed under the rule of former Communist leader Todor Zhivkov.
   Thousands of Bulgarian Christians drove Saturday to a Greek
border post and requested permanent residence to protest the
restoration of rights to ethnic Turks in their town, 80 percent of
whose population is of Turkish origin.
   The busloads of Bulgarians - estimated at from 2,000 to 5,000 by
police and customs officials - were barred from leaving by
Bulgarian border authorities, a Greek customs officer at the
Ormenion crossing said.
   The protesters later returned to their home in the city of
Kardzhali, 250 miles east of Sofia. The state news agency BTA
earlier had reported a rally by Christians in the town.
   In Friday night's rally, more than 200 women marched to
Lukanov's apartment block. They waved banners reading ``We're
hungry in the dark,'' and ``Food for our children.'' They demanded
that Lukanov resign.
   Police surrounded the building, and no clashes or arrests were
reported.

<TEXT>
   Divers have found a sunken airplane
and a body believed to be that of a man prosecutors suspected of
faking his death to avoid a theft indictment and collect $4 million
in insurance money, authorities said.
   The state attorney general's office has been looking for Blan
Stewart, a 47-year-old insurance executive, since Halloween night
1988, when his rented single-engine plane disappeared near Lake
Martin in east-central Alabama as he flew from Vero Beach, Fla., to
his hometown of Huntsville in northern Alabama. Divers combing Lake
Martin found a Piper Archer aircraft at the bottom of the
65-foot-deep lake Friday morning, and a body was floating in the
cockpit, said Tallapoosa County Sheriff Joe Smith.
   Smith said the body was well-preserved, apparently because of
cold temperatures at the lake bottom.
   FBI Special Agent Gerald Shockley said the plane's registration
number matched that of the plane Stewart was flying when he was
last seen.
   Forensic experts were waiting to examine Stewart's dental
records in Montgomery, where the body was being examined Saturday.
Attorneys for Stewart's wife, Robin, said clothes found on the body
matched those Stewart was wearing.
   Federal and state prosecutors have speculated that Stewart faked
a plane crash and his death to escape charges of insurance theft
involving $590,000 he collected but allegedly failed to pass on to
insurance companies writing the policies.
   In addition, he faces first-degree theft charges in Lauderdale
County, where he is accused of passing a worthless check for nearly
$12,000 to a furniture plant.
   Insurance companies have posted a $100,000 reward for
information on whether he is alive or dead.
   In September, the FBI obtained warrants charging him with
unlawful flight after two people reported seeing him in the Virgin
Islands in late November or early December 1989.
   The FBI said telephone records subpoenaed by the state attorney
general's office showed a collect call from the Virgin Islands to
Mrs. Stewart's home in Huntsville in March. The call came six weeks
before she went to court to have her husband declared dead so she
could collect on $4 million in life insurance.
   A judge ruled, however, there was insufficient evidence to
declare Stewart dead. He said Stewart's heirs must wait seven years
before he could be declared legally dead for insurance purposes.
   Officials at the state Department of Forensic Sciences in
Montgomery declined to comment until the dental records had been
examined.
   An attorney for Mrs. Stewart, John Heacock, said several people
who knew Stewart arrived at the lake in time to see authorities
remove the body from the muck-covered aircraft.
   ``They had no doubt it was him,'' Heacock said.
   The airplane was spotted by divers hired by Mrs. Stewart who had
been scouring the lake bottom since Monday.
   The plane was discovered in the same area where searchers had
focused their efforts since Stewart's aircraft vanished, said Tom
Radney, another attorney representing Mrs. Stewart.
   ``This is in the area where our live witnesses said they heard
the plane go down,'' he said.

showers dampaned the Atlantic coast and the Northwest.
   A cold front scattered rain from Maine through New York state to
the mid-Atlantic coast Thursday afternoon while another cold front
brought rain to Washington state, northern Idaho and western
Oregon.
   Winds of up to 50 mph were reported along Alaska's northwest

readings of 50 to 65 degrees below zero.
   Strong gusty south winds blew across the northern and central
Plains regions and wind advisories were in effect for western and
central Kansas.
   Temperatures were in the 40s and 50s across much of the nation
east of the Rocky Mountains Saturday afternoon while clouds, rain
and blustery northwest winds kept temperatures in the 30s in the
northern Atlantic coastal region.
   In the northern and central high Plains, westerly winds pushed
temperatures into the 60s and 70s. Highs were in the 70s and lower
80s from southern Texas to Florida.
   Temperatures in the West were mostly in the 40s and 50s at
midday, but warmed into the 80s in the southwestern deserts. Yuma,
Ariz., reported a high of 88 degrees at 4 p.m. EST.
   Early morning lows Saturday ranged from the the 50s and lower
60s in the southwestern deserts to the upper teens and 20s in the
northern plateau and the northern Rocky Mountain region.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing in the early morning hours
across much of the northern and central plains region, the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley and across the upper Great Lakes
region.
   The nation's low Saturday morning was 15 degrees at Gunnison,

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki is
trailing far behind Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in polls for this
month's presidential election, and he is in danger of being passed
by a third candidate, a new poll shows.
   Mazowiecki, who had insisted on a gentlemanly campaign, has
begun sharper attacks on Walesa, saying his former ally in the
anti-Communist movement is promising more than he can possibly
deliver.
   The election is set for Nov. 25. If no one wins more than half
the vote, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff
Dec. 9.
   The state television polling service reported Friday that Walesa
had the support of 35 percent of the voters, to 19 percent for
Mazowiecki and 17 percent for Stanislaw Tyminski, a Polish-Canadian
businessman.
   Tyminski's fresh face and proven economic acumen are wooing
voters, the pollsters reported.
   An additional 15 percent of the voters are undecided and the
rest backed three other candidates.
   Although they fought side-by-side for a decade before the June
1989 elections that brought Solidarity to power, Walesa has
lambasted Mazowiecki as being ``a turtle'' so cautious that ``he
couldn't catch a flea.'' He said he had appointed Mazowiecki to be
a ``transitional'' prime minister.
   Mazowiecki, who pledges to resign as prime minister the day
Walesa is sworn in as president, fought back Friday before a crowd
of about 2,000 students at Gdansk Polytechnic University in
Walesa's hometown.
   Mazowiecki said he was running for president to protect his
government's cautious but determined reform program.
   The difference between himself and Walesa, Mazowiecki said, was
that ``I will not promise that it will be done easily and
overnight.''
   ``Mr. Walesa ... makes promises that it will not be possible to
realize,'' he said.
   The labor leader has offered to divide up Poland's state-owned
enterprise and give each Pole hundreds of dollars.
   Mazowiecki also suggested that Walesa might undermine democracy
by not observing a ``constitutional balance of powers.'
   ``In a modern democracy, one person cannot stand higher than all
the people,'' he said.

   Scientists have positively identified a skeleton
exhumed from a New York cemetery as the remains of a Haitian slave
who is a candidate to become America's first black saint, Cardinal
John O'Connor said Saturday.
   A team of archaeologists, forensic scientists and
anthropologists determined that a skeleton dug up earlier this
month was that of Pierre Toussaint, the cardinal said.
   ``The definitive identification was made of the bones, all of
them in order, not a single one missing,'' O'Connor said at an
archdiocesan conference on racial and ethnic issues. ``This indeed
is the skeleton of Pierre Toussaint.''
   Toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to New York at age 21 by
his French owners. Still enslaved, he became a leading hairdresser
in the city and was allowed to keep some of his income.
   
   When Toussaint's owner died, he left an impoverished widow and
child. In a typical act of generosity, Toussaint secretly supported
them for 20 years. The widow freed Toussaint from slavery just
before she died in 1807.
   Once free, he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on
charities, including an orphanage and the city's first school for
black children. He also entered quarantined sections of the city to
help yellow fever victims.
   Toussaint was buried at Old St. Patrick's Church Cemetery in the
city's Little Italy section after his death in 1853 at age 87.
   
   He is considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he
helped the needy for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance
existed.
   For decades, historians have been studying the life of
Toussaint, whose last name means ``all saints.''
   
   The church began working to have Toussaint considered for
sainthood last December, said church spokesman Joe Zwilling.
   ``We're interested in Pierre Toussaint's holiness and what drove
him to do things,'' O'Connor said.
   The examination of his remains is a preliminary step during the
period of investigation of his life. The examination occurs before
he is considered for beatification, and is only an early step in a
process that could take years. Toussaint's remains will stay at Old
St. Patrick's Church until they are moved to St. Patrick's
Cathedral, where they will be kept with the remains of bishops and
other holy people, Zwilling said.
   ``It will be a wonderful thing for the city of New York if a
canonization process ultimately takes place,'' O'Connor said. ``It
will restore some pride in the city. It will be a great thing for
the church. It will be a fine thing for the black community.''
   Digging for the remains began Nov. 1, but the first three
skeletons unearthed were determined not to be Toussaint's.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first
heart-liver transplant recipient, was eulogized Saturday as a
gallant, courageous youngster who strived to live a normal life.
   The 13-year-old girl who battled organ rejection, hepatitis and
medical complications before her body suddenly rejected her
transplanted heart last Sunday, was laid to rest in a cemetery in
this suburb of Fort Worth.
   At a 45-minute funeral service, many of the estimated 400
mourners burst into laughter several times as Jerry Conley, a
minister at West Freeway Church of Christ, celebrated her life.
   ``Everything was always upbeat with this very special child,''
Conley said. ``Stormie has conquered life more gallantly perhaps
than any person you or I have ever known. Her illness was not her
enemy.
   ``Stormie was a very simple young lady,'' he said. ``She didn't
really want all the fanfare that went with all of this. She wantedto be
just an average teen-age girl.''
   She was later buried at a private ceremony attended only by her
family and close friends.
   At the church service, White Settlement Mayor James Herring read
a resolution the City Council approved earlier in the week,
recognizing Stormie as an honored citizen.
   ``She lived her life for others,'' Herring said. ``She didn't
desire the notoriety that came her way but she was willing to do
her part as a result of that. When called upon to step forward and
talk to folks, talk to the news cameras ... she was always there
and ready and willing.''
   Herring also read a poem one of Stormie's classmates wrote after
her death.
   ``Most say you were just a little girl, but you were an angel to
me,'' he read. ``You've been our little lady, your courage was so
true. When things seemed to go bad, you always pulled through.''
   Stormie died Nov. 10 at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh -
where she underwent her historic operation on Feb. 14, 1984. She
had been rushed to the hospital from her home with a sore throat
and fever.
   Doctors at the hospital said Friday that Stormie died because
her body had suddenly rejected the transplanted heart. The autopsy
results surprised Stormie's doctors, who said an organ rejection so
many years after a transplant was rare.
   ``No one expected to see any rejection in Stormie,'' said Dr. F.
Jay Fricker, her cardiologist at Children's. ``After all, we had a
track record of more than six years of never seeing any heart
rejection. So why would we suddenly see it now?''
   Fricker said it would take months for doctors to determine, if
at all, what caused the heart rejection.
   Doctors declined to speculate whether FK-506, an experimental
anti-rejection drug Stormie began receiving last November, a second
liver transplant she underwent last February or treatment for
recurring bouts of hepatitis caused the rejection.
   The blond, brown-eyed girl needed the heart-liver transplant
because of hypocholesteremia, a rare genetic disorder that
prevented her body from processing cholesterol. Her sister, Misty,
suffers from a milder form of the disease.
   Stormie had few major medical problems the first five years
after her Valentine's Day transplant. But she had to return to
Pittsburgh in 1988 for surgery to remove a bile duct obstruction.
   She underwent a mild episode of liver rejection in November 1989
and began receiving the experimental FK-506 instead of the
traditional anti-rejection drug cyclosporine.
   A bout with hepatitis in February slowly damaged her liver,
requiring a second liver transplant. But clinical studies done
after surgery showed no evidence of heart problems, Fricker said.
   Stormie began rejecting the second liver in May and was treated
with an increased dosage of FK-506. A month later, she received
medication for another bout of hepatitis.
   Recent flu-like symptoms were the only indication something was
wrong.

   Backed by more than 1,000 warplanes, U.S. and Saudi troops
prepared Saturday for a mock invasion near the Kuwaiti border. A
top Iraqi general warned the U.S.-led force that his army has a
``surprise'' up its sleeve.
   President Bush was in Czechoslovakia, beginning an eight-day
trip that will take him to the Saudi desert for Thanksgiving with
U.S. troops. His secretary of state, James A. Baker III, also was
in Europe, seeking support for a U.N. resolution authorizing force
against Iraq.
   Bush, in Prague to commemorate the first anniversary of the
country's peaceful revolution, referred to the Persian Gulf crisis
in a speech to Czechoslovak lawmakers.
   ``You know from your own bitter experience that the world cannot
turn a blind eye to aggression.'' he said. ``You know the futility
and vain hope that aggressors can be appeased.''
   One-third of Czechoslovakia's territory was ceded in 1938 to the
Nazis in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Adolf Hitler from
conquering other countries.
   In an essay written for the Nov. 26 issue of Newsweek, Bush
renewed his effort to rally Americans behind his policies on the
gulf crisis. He wrote that ``the world must not reward aggression''
and said the United States ``cannot allow any tyrant to practice
economic blackmail'' with oil.
   Imminent Thunder, as the current six-day exercises in the gulf
are named, is being supported by about 1,100 aircraft, the largest
force of warplanes yet assembled for a Desert Shield exercise.
   The drill is meant to emphasize gaining control of the skies,
which would be critical to smash Iraqi defenses.
   ``The first thing you want to do is establish air superiority,''
said Lt. Cmdr. Ron Morse, a U.S. Navy spokesman.
   Baghdad has called Imminent Thunder a ``provocative act''
because of its proximity to Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2. News
reports have said part of the maneuvers could come within 10 miles
of the Kuwaiti border.
   No live ammunition will be fired, officials say.
   The actual landing from amphibious landing craft and helicopters
was set for Sunday. It was to involve 1,000 troops from the 4th
Marine Expeditionary Battalion.
   About 500 to 800 troops will hit the beach Sunday, according to
pool reports based on briefings aboard the USS Nassau, the flagship
for the amphibious landing. Commanders said a key objective is to
practice an assault from ships 30 miles from shore.
   In Baghdad, meanwhile, an Iraqi general said that the
U.S.-dominated multinational force would face ``uncalculated
developments'' should it attack Iraq.
   Maj. Gen. Mundhir Abdul-Rahman, a missile expert and head of the
Iraqi army's morale department, did not say what the ``surprise
elements'' were. But he said they would thwart an offensive. His
comments were published in Al-Qadissiya, the army's daily
newspaper.
   It was difficult to determine whether the general was speaking
in his capacity as a specialist in long-range weaponry or as chief
military morale booster.
   In his article, Abdul-Rahman wrote: ``The surprise element by
Iraq will make the American aggression face uncalculated
developments and unexpected results in (Iraq's) reaction, which
would make their execution of aggression ... impossible.''
   Britain's daily Independent newspaper reported Saturday that
Iraq is believed to have assembled three so-called ``superguns''
able to fire shells a distance of 465 miles.
   U.S. intelligence sources believe the guns, largely assembled
from British-made components, might have been deliverd to Iraq
before production of the weapons was discovered earlier this year.
   Abdul-Rahman said his country was prepared to defend itself
despite plans to increase U.S. troop strength. U.S. officials
announced earlier this month that another 200,000 U.S. troops would
join the 230,000 Americans already deployed in the region.
   They face an estimated 430,000 Iraqi troops in southern Iraq and
Kuwait.
   In recent comments, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has indicated he
still hopes for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. And a
Soviet envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, has said he believes Saddam is
softening his stance.
   Still, Baker has been seeking support for a U.N. resolution
authorizing force against Iraq if peaceful means fail. He has
argued that without such a resolution, the alliance against Iraq
will not be presenting a united front.
   Baker met in Geneva on Saturday with the foreign ministers of
Ethiopia, Zaire and Ivory Coast, all members of the 15-nation
Security Council. Zaire's foreign minister, Kalimba Wakatana
Mushobekwa, said his government would back the proposed resolution.
   U.N. diplomats say Baker is lobbying foreign ministers from
Security Council nations to come to New York and personally vote on
the proposed resolution - a rare step.
   A Baker aide has said the United States would likely put forth
the resolution before the end of the month.
   The Security Council has passed several measures against Iraq,
including strict trade sanctions.
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi health minister said that as a result of
the U.N. embargo, a shortage of medicine, other medical supplies
and baby formula has become ``deadly serious.''
   Jordan's King Hussein, meanwhile, bitterly criticized Western
countries Saturday for applying ``double standards'' in the Middle
East by not dealing simultaneously with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
He accused them of seeking to control Arab resources.
   In an apparent reference to the United States and Britain,
Hussein accused unnamed world powers of ``blatant and shameless
conduct'' in the Middle East and said:
   ``Their actual goals stem from the desire to control our destiny
and the Arab nation's resources.''
   Hussein's country has been hard hit by the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq, its main trading partner. It says it has kept to the
sanctions, despite popular support for Saddam in the country.
   In New York, a human rights group issued a report documenting
the crackdown by Iraqi occupiers on the Kuwaiti population. Middle
East Watch said Iraq had carried out scores of public executions,
midnight searches and arbitrary arrests, according to the report
released Saturday.
   ``In addition to crowded and unsanitary conditions, detainees
reported being severely beaten with clubs, metal pipes and electric
rods,'' the report reads. ``Mock executions ... were also reported.
Some detainees were subjected to electric shocks that caused severe
pain and bleeding from the mouth, nose and ear.''
   Aziz Abu Hamad, who wrote the report, said in an interview
Saturday that his team had been able to track down 250 executions.
He said it is ``not a pretty picture and it's getting worse.''

   President Bush has asked former drug czar
William Bennett to take over Lee Atwater's job as chairman of the
Republican Party in January and Bennett has accepted, GOP sources
said Saturday.
   Bennett, a former secretary of education in Ronald Reagan's
cabinet, formally resigned Nov. 8 as head of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
   A GOP source said Atwater, who managed Bush's 1988 presidential
campaign, will continue to play a major strategy role for the GOP,
possibly with a title as the party's ``general chairman.''
   Such a structure would not be unique, the source said, citing
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.'s chairmanship of the Republican National
Committee in the 1980s while then-Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., held
the title as the party's general chairman.
   A formal announcement will not be made until Bush returns from
his eight-day trip to Czechoslovakia, Germany, France, Egypt and
the Persian Gulf, said the source, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
   Atwater, 39, has been undergoing intensive treatment for cancer
since a tumor was discovered on the right side of his brain last
March. His two-year term as GOP chairman expires in January.
   B.J. Cooper, a Republican Party spokesman, said that Bennett
``is on a short list of people being considered'' to succeed
Atwater ``but there's been no formal announcement at this time.''
   Cooper said Bush's choice for a new Republican chairman would
have to be ratified by the party's national committee in January.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, meeting with his party's
$100,000 donors in Atlanta, said he welcomes Bennett's appointment
as his chief adversary with ``open arms.''
   ``If Bennett accomplishes as much for the Republican Party as he
achieved at the Education Department and in ridding us of drugs and
violence, Americans will have to begin worrying about the future of
the two-party system,'' Brown quipped.
   Atwater was more of a tactician than an ideologue. After GOP
candidates lost to pro-choice Democrats in two high-profile
governors races in 1989, he acted quickly to move the Republican
party away from its hard-line opposition to abortion.
   But he also had what Democrats denounced as a ``pit bull style
of politics,'' citing his use of ``Willie Horton'' ads against
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis in 1988.
   Horton is a convicted murderer who raped a woman in Maryland
while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison while Dukakis was the
state's governor.
   Bennett, 47, also has a reputation for confrontation and
brashness. Two weeks ago when Bush accepted his resignation,
Bennett called Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a frequent critic of
his drug policies, ``a gasbag.''

   As British politicians calculate the pros and cons
of life without Margaret Thatcher as prime minister, six polls
published Sunday gave a new boost to the man who is trying to
unseat her.
   But Mrs. Thatcher was reported Sunday as saying she will not
quit, even if she wins the looming leadership battle in her
Conservative Party by only a narrow margin.
   ``If we win according to the rules, we win, and that's it,'' the
Sunday Telegraph reported her as saying in an interview. Mrs.
Thatcher said she would not be swayed by the desires of senior
party officials.
   ``The rules were not made by me,'' she said. ``I abide by the
rules. I expect others to abide by the rules.''
   The newspaper polls showed voters believe Mrs. Thatcher's
opponent for the party leadership, former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine, has a better chance of leading the Tories to victory at
the next general election.
   But the Sunday Express reported in its own poll of 332 of the
372 Tory legislators, who will ultimately decide Mrs. Thatcher's
fate, that 162 said they would vote for Mrs. Thatcher. Thirty-one
said they would support Heseltine, while 27 said they did not know
and 112 refused to answer.
   At the midpoint of a six-day party campaign that could bring the
end of Mrs. Thatcher's 11{ years in power, a headline in Saturday's
editions of the Financial Times reflected a new mood: ``The spell
is finall broken.''
   Since Heseltine announced his candidacy for Conservative leader
and prime minister Wednesday, some of Mrs. Thatcher's old friends
have defected.
   The Sunday Times endorsed Heseltine over Mrs. Thatcher, saying
voters were ``jaded with her and tired of her ways to an extent
that has made her an electoral liability.''
   The Times said its decision to go against Mrs. Thatcher was a
painful one, but warned: ``If the Tories do not change their
leader, the voters are likely to change their government.''
   Even some of her supporters have been lukewarm. The Economist
magazine endorsed her, but only after saying: ``Mrs. Thatcher,
truly a world figure, no longer commands respect where it matters
most for Britain: in the European Community. To her fellow EC
leaders, she has become a bore, a ranter, nothing more.''
   In the Telegraph interview, Mrs. Thatcher said she might hold a
referendum on the constitutional issues relating to Britain's role
in Europe, an issue which has split her party and threatened her
leadership.
   The debate about how much sovereignty Britain should yield to
the European Community is an explosive one for the Conservative
Party. Mrs. Thatcher strongly opposes plans by the other 11
community nations for a single currency and what she sees as a
federal Europe. Heseltine has argued for a less confrontational
British approach in Europe.
   A Market and Opinion Research International poll for the Sunday
Times suggested the Conservatives trailed Labor by 11 percent with
Mrs. Thatcher as leader, but jumped to one point ahead of the
opposition under Heseltine. The pollsters interviewed 1,059 voters
Friday.
   A Gallup poll of 1,006 adults Thursday and Friday for the
conservative Telegraph indicated 63 percent of Conservatives voters
believed the party was most likely to win the next election under
Heseltine.
   Only 35 percent said the same of Mrs. Thatcher, who enjoyed less
Tory confidence than former deputy prime minister Sir Geoffrey
Howe, with 38 percent.
   Sir Geoffrey, who resigned earlier this month, helped prompt
Heseltine's bid when he stood up in the House of Commons and
denounced Mrs. Thatcher as a liabilty to Britain's vital interests
in Europe.
   A poll for the Sunday Correspondent by the market research
consultants ICM Research suggested the Tories were 12 percent
behind Labor if Mrs. Thatcher remains Tory leader. But her party
vaulted to 8 percent ahead under Heseltine. The company interviewed
947 voters Friday.
   Similar results were published in polls for the liberal
Observer; the Mail on Sunday and the Independent on Sunday.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd ran well behind Mrs. Thatcher and
Heseltine in most of the polls. Hurd discounted speculation he may
stand in a second ballot, saying Mrs. Thatcher had his ``full
backing.''
   No margin of error was given in the polls.
   It is considered unlikely that Heseltine, who resigned from the
Cabinet in 1986, can win outright on Tuesday, but even Mrs.
Thatcher's supporters are thinking aloud about what happens if that
first ballot is inconclusive.
   Since nobody knows how the secret vote will go Tuesday, everyone
can speculate. Among the possibilities:
   -Mrs. Thatcher crushes Heseltine on the first ballot and leads
the party into the next general election, which must be held by
mid-1992.
   -Mrs. Thatcher wins but Heseltine runs strongly, eroding her
authority as leader of the party and the government - the
``nightmare scenario,'' in the words of the pro-Thatcher Daily
Telegraph.
   -Heseltine forces a second ballot, opening the door for other
candidates to step forward and putting Mrs. Thatcher under great
pressure to quit.
   A second round of voting, if necessary, would be on Nov. 27,
with the possibility of a third round on Nov. 29.

   Red Army soldiers fired warning shots and beat
some protesters Saturday to break up an anti-Soviet march outside a
military base in Lithuania, news reports said. At least five people
were reported injured.
   The draft-age youths, estimated at 200, chanted anti-Soviet
slogans as they marched from Cathedral Square in the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius, to the military base, Radio Vilnius said. There,
they threw down their draft cards, according to the report.
   The official Tass news agency reported that the protesters
chanted ``Soviet army, get away from Lithuania!'' and other similar
slogans. The demonstration developed into a scuffle at the gate,
Tass said.
   Tass and Radio Vilnius reported that the Soviet soldiers fired
warning shots and used water cannons to disperse the crowd. The
Lithuanian report also said the soldiers ``ran out into the street
and began to beat the demonstrators'' and local police.
   Five people sought medical treatment after the clash, the radio
report said. Tass confirmed there were injuries but did not say how
many.
   Soviet soldiers reportedly drove through the streets of Vilnius
after the protest and fired machine guns, apparently to intimidate
residents.
   The demonstration, organized by the Lithuanian Liberty League
and other groups, was held to support Lithuania's claim that it
should be participating in the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe that begins Monday in Paris, both reports
said.
   Lithuania declared independence in March but later froze
measures to realize it because of an economic embargo by the
Kremlin.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday said Soviet
soldiers and their dependents in the Baltics have had their civil
rights violated as the republics have asserted their independence
from the Soviet Union.

   Explosives apparently set by leftist radicals went
off Sunday near the Grand Shrines of Ise, which Emperor Akihito is
to visit next week, police said.
   The blasts caused no injuries and only minor damage at the main
train station in Ise, and along the Kinki Nippon Railroad, which
Akihito and Empress Michiko will use when they travel to Ise to
pray to the sun goddess next Tuesday and Wednesday.
   A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
batteries and wiring of the type used in detonators were found near
some of the bomb sites.
   The Ise station is a short walk from the shrines, the most
important in Japan's Shinto religion. The shrines are believed to
be the home of sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom the emperor is by
legend descended.
   Leftist radicals claimed responsibility for about 40 fires,
missile firings and bombings around Tokyo during Akihito's state
enthronement ceremony last Monday.
   The radicals oppose the monarchy as a remnant of Japan's prewar
nationalism and have vowed to continue their attacks until after
the final enthronement-related ceremony in early December.

<HEAD>Striking Newspaper Workers Go Door to Door for Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Daily News workers, some accompanied by
their children, went door to door Saturday asking people to cancel
their subscriptions to the tabloid.
   ``It's very moving to hear a child tell somebody, `My mom or dad
is out of work because of the strike, don't buy the paper,''' said
Ray Melville of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local 3.
   About 350 strikers and their supporters fanned out through the
New York borough of Queens, knocking o doors and asking
subscribers to stop having the Daily News delivered.
   It was the latest union effort to cripple distribution of the
newspaper, which has published every day since the strike began
Oct. 25, despite sporadic violence.
   Some newsstand vendors said they were intimidated into keeping
the News off their shelves. The News has hired homeless and
unemployed hawkers to peddle the paper on street corners.
   The News said last week that it was printing 600,000 copies a
day and selling about 400,000, down from 1.09 million before the
strike. Company officials said 2,000 of its usual 12,000 outlets
were selling the newspaper, the nation's third largest metropolitan
daily.

   Iraqi forces in Kuwait have executed at least
250 people, arbitrarily detained thousands more and are
systematically erasing all signs of Kuwaiti culture, a human rights
group charged Saturday.
   About one month after the Aug. 2 invasion, the Iraqi government
of President Saddam Hussein began a harsh crackdown in response to
both armed resistance and peaceful demonstrations in the oil-rich
emirate, the watchdog group Middle East Watch said in a report.
   ``Since then a systemic pattern has emerged of gross abuses,''
the report said. ``Free expression has been muzzled and free
assembly banned; and violators are severely punished.''
   The author of the 18-page report said that while conditions in
Kuwait were grim, they were not as severe as some news reports have
portrayed them.
   ``There have been diplomats and other reports saying there were
7,000 summary executions,'' Aziz Abu Hamad said in an interview.
``We only tracked down 250 such executions. But it is still not a
pretty picture and it's getting worse.''
   The report tallied only those executions that took place after
Aug. 5, three days after the invasion, Hamad said.
   The availability of food and medical care is rapidly dwindling,
Hamad said. More than 5,000 people have been arrested, and of about
3,000 still in detention, 14 percent are under 20 years, he said.
   The occupation has produced between 300,000 and 400,000 Kuwaiti
refugees but the report said that there is no Iraqi policy to
replace them with Iraqis.
   While individuals live in fear and hardship, the invasion has
also resulted in the slow erasure of Kuwaiti culture, the report
said.
   ``Iraqi occupation authorities embarked on large-scale,
systematic appropriation of the equipment, furniture and archives
of Kuwaiti institutions, including hospitals, schools and
museums,'' the report said.
   ``Iraqi troops confiscated valuables from homes during searches
and from those fleeing the country,'' it said.
   Many Kuwaitis are homeless and have little or no access to
hospitals, which have all been taken over by the Iraqi military.
Many medical personnal have been detained or killed, the report
claimed.
   Hamad, a consultant to Middle East Watch, said he met with more
than 200 refugees who have recently fled Kuwait, and conducted
about 70 interviews with people who were active in the community
and had direct contact with Iraqi forces.
   Middle East Watch was formed in 1989 to monitor human rights
abuses in the Middle East.
   The interviews took place in several cities in Saudi Arabia,
Cairo and New York City during October and early November. Those
interviewed included doctors, hospital administrators, civic
leaders and academics as well as people who had been detained or
have relatives who had been detained or killed.
   ``They were people who couldn't take the conditions anymore, the
abuse, the lack of food, and fled,'' Hamad said.
   Maltreatment and torture of detainees has been widespread, Hamad
said. Reports of sleep deprivation, beatings with sticks and pipes
and threats of killing other family members were common among
former detainees, he said.
   ``In addition to crowded and unsanitary conditions, detainees
reported being severely beaten with clubs, metal pipes and electric
rods,'' the report said.
   ``Mock executions ... were also reported,'' it said. ``Some
detainees were subjected to electric shocks that caused severe pain
and bleeding from the mouth, nose and ear.''

<TEXT>
   Paramedics, firefighters and even
trained dogs got a taste of the Big One as they pulled ``victims''
out of collapsed buildings and crushed cars Saturday during
Indiana's largest disaster drill ever.
   State emergency officials called the earthquake drill a success,
saying they would now be better prepared for the real thing.
   But they admitted no practice event could imitate the stress of
a true catastrophe with real victims.
   ``We can simulate almost everything but personal feelings,''
said Dave Perkins, operations director for the State Emergency
Management Agency. ``We can't mimic the emotional stress.''
   The exercise attracted more attention than most annual diasaster
drills because of a New Mexico scientist's disputed projection of a
50-50 chance for an early December quake along the New Madrid
Fault, said Jerome Hauer, the agency's director.
   The fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., north to Cairo, Ill., and
affects parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Illinois and
Kentucky.
   Earthquake experts have declared Iben Browning's projection
meaningless. But Hauer said it has helped focus public attention on
the possibility of a Midwest earthquake.
   During the drill, which involved more than 200 people, rescue
workers were tested on their abilities to respond to the
devastation that would be caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on
the Richter scale, followed by two strong aftershocks.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude
of 6 or more can cause severe damage in populated areas.
   The drill provided the state's first test of an innovation for
dealing with such disasters. A small airplane flown by the Civil
Air Patrol videotaped the disaster scene and relayed pictures to a
monitor at the Vanderburgh County Emergency Management Agency.
   The drill was a bit too realistic for some volunteer
``victims.''
   At least three Ivy Tech students suffered symptoms of mild
hypothermia after waiting in a chilly basement about four hours to
be ``rescued.'' An ambulance took one to a hospital, where he was
treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Indonesia to Ban New York Times Reporter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indonesia is banning an American
reporter because of an article the government considers offensive
to President Suharto, the national radio said Saturday.
   ``The article is insulting to the head of state and the
nation,'' it quoted Information Minister Harmoko as saying. Harmoko
said the New York Times reporter would be prohibited from entering
the country.
   The Nov. 11 Times story, written by Steven Erlanger, said
Suharto's children profited from businesses connected with most
major government projects, including toll roads. It said Suharto's
ability to protect those business interests could affect his
decision in 1993 to step down or remain in office for a sixth
five-year term.
   Contacted in BAngkok, Thailand, where he is based, Erlanger
said: ``I regret this reaction to my article. I meant no disrespect
to President Suharto. I simply reported on an important issue that
many Indonesians discuss and discussed with me.''
   The government in 1986 banned an Australian journalist after the
Sydney Morning Herald published a critical story.
   The article said Suharto's family and friends had amassed huge
personal fortunes. Relations between the two countries soured as a
result of the incident.

<HEAD>Former Hostage Tells of Captivity in Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American who was wounded by Iraqi soldiers in
Kuwait and recently allowed to leave contended that Westerners
being held by Iraqi forces oppose a full-scale war but would back a
military strike against Iraq.
   Miles Hoffman, 33, of Columbus, told The Atlanta Constitution on
Saturday he left the Persian Gulf with his arm fractured by an
Iraqi soldier's bullet and the belief that Saddam Hussein is a
deranged dictator who deserves to die.
   ``The man is a ruthless, bloody murderer who killed at 15,''
Hoffman told the newspaper in a telephone interview from London.
``He needs to be taken out, and he needs to be taken out now.''
   Hoffman said he was shot in the arm when he was captured in
Kuwait on Sept. 5. He was among 174 hostages freed by Iraq on Nov.
9 after talks between Saddam and former West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt.
   Hoffman, who had worked for as a financial analyst for the
Kuwaiti government, said no Western hostages want war in the Middle
East, but ``every hostage that I knew wanted an immediate military
strike'' against Iraq.
   Hoffman's comments echoed those made Monday by a caller to a
Cleveland, Ohio, television station. The caller said he was among a
group of Americans hiding out in Kuwait and said he supported
military action against Iraq.
   Hoffman was to be reunited in Columbus on Sunday with his family
and his fiancee, Nikki Murgatroyd of Forton, England.
   Hoffman said he was held at two strategic sites in Iraq, part of
the ``human shield'' used by Saddam to deter attack by U.S.-led
multinational forces deployed to the gulf after Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   He said hostages were fed small amounts three times a day,
sometimes eating carry-out pizza, chicken, spaghetti, or just a
bowl of rice, Hoffman said.
   Commanders would ``keep most of the money'' allotted for feeding
hostages.
   Hostages whiled away the hours listening to the radio, playing
cards or exercising, Hoffman said.
   Their captors called them guests ``not out of belief, but out of
fear,'' Hoffman said. ``Even the doctors I saw would not admit that
we were hostages.''

<HEAD>Child Awarded $2 Million in Damages for Field Trip Injury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state judge has awarded more than $2
million to a child injured when an adult-sized metal swing slammed
into her hip during a kindergarten field trip.
   Jennifer Mangel, 7, was injured on May 25, 1988, during a field
trip to Parent's Park at Pinecrest State School, a residential
school for the mentally retarded.
   Lee, who heard the case in May without a jury, awarded $2.1
million in damages to Jennifer and $250,000 to her mother, Nancy C.
Glanker of Alexandria.
   Lee found the Rapides Parish School Board and the state
Department of Health and Hospitals, which runs Pinecrest, equally
at fault for Jennifer's injury and liable for the damages.
   State attorneys said Friday they would appeal Lee's ruling,
saying his findings were erroneous and the damage award was
excessive. An attorney for the school board said the board was
considering an appeal.
   ``To date Jennifer's life has been very sad to say the least,
but the quality of her future life is even worse ...'' District
Judge Robert E. Lee wrote in his opinion, released Wednesday.
``Jennifer has nothing to look forward to but a life of surgery,
pain, anxiety, mental anguish.''
   A metal glider-type swing weighing about 60 pounds hit Jennifer
on her hip when she slipped while pushing a friend. Lee said an
expert calculated the swing hit her with about 300 times the force
of gravity.
   The judge said the the children were not adequately supervised
and the park was not safe for children.
   Joseph T. Dalrymple, an attorney for Jennifer and her mother,
said the girl has had two operations and will need several more.
She also is likely to suffer from severe arthritis and may need a
hip replacement when she is in her 30s, he said.
   She now wears a brace shaped like a metal girdle that keeps her
legs spread wide apart to reduce pressure on the hip joint,
Dalrymple said.

<HEAD>Army Major Sentenced to 23 Years For Trying to Kill Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army major was sentenced to 23
years of confinement Saturday for trying to kill his wife by
hitting her with a toilet tank lid.
   Maj. David Schneider, 35, also will forfeit all pay and
allowances and be dismissed from the Army.
   He was sentenced by the same panel of eight officers that found
him guilty Friday of attempted murder and two counts of conduct
unbecoming an officer, involving perjury and adultery. He had faced
a maximum 26-year sentence.
   Schneider, a West Point graduate, will serve his sentence at the
Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks. He showed no emotion during
sentencing.
   A civilian court in Platte County, Mo., acquitted Schneider
earlier this year in another case involving injury to his wife.
Schneider was accused of flipping his wife, Deborah, over a hotel
balcony railing. She fell eight floors and survived.
   Mrs. Schneider has since filed for divorce. She has been unable
to remember her fall and could not say whether her husband hit her
with the toilet lid while she slept in October 1989 at their Fort
Leavenworth home.
   Military prosecutors accused Schneider of having an affair with
a woman in California.
   ``The affair made him want to kill his wife,'' a military
prosecutor, Capt. Richard O'Keefe Jr., said in closing arguments
Friday.
   The defense rested its case Thursday without calling Schneider
to testify in his own behalf. Both a pathologist and a crime lab
examiner testifying for the defense said the toilet lid did not
cause Mrs. Schneider's wounds.
   In the civilian case, prosecutors had alleged that Schneider
threw his wife over a Kansas City hotel railing last November. A
jury found him innocent after he testified that he was carrying his
wife in a romantic gesture, when she arched her back or fidgeted
and he accidentally dropped her.

   The Postal Service will experiment with bar
codes on Christmas cards sent by 1,900 Ohio customers to speed up
delivery of the holiday mail.
   The volunteers will share their card mailing lists with the
Postal Service, which will create bar code labels for the envelopes
that can be read by sorting equipment.
   The experiment will involve postal customers in Akron, Canton,
Kent, Ravenna, Wadsworth and Medina.
   Postal officials hope the bar labels will help move holiday mail
faster. Mail with bar labels is sorted by automatic equipment,
rather than by hand.
   The Postal Service expects to use bar codes on 100,000 pieces of
holiday mail this year. The Akron-Canton area alone handles 7
million Christmas cards each season.
   Lou Eberhardt, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington,
said concerns over postal customers sharing their private mailing
lists was a concern, but officials decided privacy would not be
jeopardized.

   An insurance executive's estate donated
$38.9 million each to Samford University and Asbury Theological
Seminary in Wilmore, Ky. Officials at the schools said it was the
largest bequest to a U.S. educational institution since 1986.
   The gift was made by Ralph Waldo Beeson, a retired executive
with Liberty National Life Insurance Co. who died Oct. 15 at age
89. He had given Samford numerous gifts over the last 20 years.
   ``It is truly a transformational gift that enables us to
leapfrog as an institution,'' said Samford President Thomas E.
Corts.
   The gift to Asbury, a 67-year-old independent seminary with
about 700 students, will more than double the school's endowment
and provide money for a new preaching center, professorial chairs
and scholarships, said vice president for advancement Bob Bridges.
   The bequest is the largest to a U.S. educational institution
since the estate of Lilliore Green Rains provided $40 million
bequests to Stanford University, Loyola Marymount University,
California Institute of Technology and Pomona College in 1986,
according to Giving USA, a publication of the American Association
of Fund-Raising Counsel.
   Beeson's bequest also eclipsed the $21.5 gift of Winton M.
Blount to the Alabama Shakespeare Theatre, located in Montgomery.
   Samford is Alabama's largest private college or university and
is affiliated with the Alabama Baptist State Convention. The
university has an enrollment of 4,164 students from 43 states and
39 nations.
   A quiet, retiring individual who downplayed his philanthropies,
Beeson told friends, ``It's the Lord's money. He gave me the gift
of making it. I am not smart enough to make that much money on my
own. It's his money, and I am going to give it back to him.''

   The Army and Marine Corps are calling an
additional 15,092 reservists to active duty because of the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The latest call-ups announced Friday bring to 51,587 the total
number of reservists activated from all military services since
President Bush first authorized their use for Operation Desert
Shield in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It is now the largest call to active duty for American
citizen-soldiers since the Berlin crisis in 1961, when about
150,000 reservists were activated.
   Also on Friday the Marine Corps said it was preparing to send to
the gulf for the first time a tank battalion with M-1A1 tanks, the
most modern U.S. battle tank. Marines now in the gulf are equipped
with less-powerful M-60 tanks.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The ``Keating Five'' senators struck emotional
chords in defense of their integrity as the Senate Ethics Committee
gave them their first chance to publicly respond to a special
counsel's influence-peddling evidence against them.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., about to begin radiation therapy
for prostate cancer, invoked the names of his son and sister Friday
and said that with his career nearing an end, ``my cherished
reputation'' was on the line in the savings and loan affair.
   `With all my heart and soul, I want to make very clear ... I
engaged in no unethical conduct,'' the 76-year-old Cranston said.
``You know that I broke no law. You know that I broke no Senate
rule. You know that I pocketed no money.''
   Equally spirited declarations were offered by three of the other
four senators: Republican John McCain of Arizona, and Democrats
John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   The fifth senator, Democrat Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, gets
his chance to make an opening statement on Monday, when the panel
holds its third day of hearings. After he speaks, committee special
counsel Robert S. Bennett will begin presenting witnesses and
offering evidence.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump christened the lavish Taj Mahal
casino less than a year ago as the showpiece of his big-bucks
empire. Now it's headed for bankruptcy-court protection, though he
still will retain control over it.
   Trump and his Taj Mahal bondholders agreed Friday to a debt
restructuring that will temporarily place the plush Atlantic City,
N.J., gambling palace under bankruptcy-court protection and give
the investors half ownership.
   The deal was reached more than 12 hours after Trump missed a
$47.3 million interest payment on $675 million in junk bonds used
to finance the casino.
   Some details of the agreement were still to be worked out, but
bondholder representatives said it contained several incentives for
Trump to improve the performance of the Taj Mahal. But he also
could lose control of the casino altogether if it operates more
than 15 percent over budget.

   International scholars deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls have
chosen a new chief editor, hoping to speed up work on the ancient
manuscripts. The incumbent called the move a power play by academic
rivals.
   The scholars appointed Emmanuel Tov to share duties with editor
in chief John Strugnell and complete work still unfinished about
four decades after the documents' discovery.
   ``Once you get to a point where a whole generation who has
looked forward to getting published are getting older and dying,
the level of frustration gets higher,'' said Eugene Ulrich,
theology professor at University of Notre Dame.
   The Dead Sea Scrolls, first discovered in 1947 in a cave in
present-day Israel, are considered one of the richest religious
libraries ever discovered from the period that gave birth to
Christianity and modern Judaism.
