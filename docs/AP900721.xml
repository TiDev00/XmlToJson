<HEAD>Former Procurement Official Sentenced in Connecticut Contract Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy procurement official was
sentenced to 15 months in prison Friday for conspiring to help a
Connecticut contractor obtain a $100 million Marine Corps contract.
   The defendant, George W. Stone, pleaded guilty in May to charges
of copnspiracy and conversion of government property.
   Stone, 46, formerly with the Space and Naval Warfare Systems
Command, admitted passing confidential information about the
contract for a communications system to a former boss, Mark C.
Saunders, then a consultant.
   Stone told Saunders how Norden Systems Inc. was doing in the
competition for the contract, and Saunders told the company.
   ``He stood to gain nothing, and in fact he gained nothing,''
Stone's lawyer, Brian P. Getting, told U.S. District Judge Claude
M. Hilton.
   Saunders is awaiting sentencing in the case.
   Stone's case is one of more than 30 convictions resulting from
the government's long-running ``Ill Wind'' investigastion into
defense contracts.

   Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan
resigned Friday after a 34-year career as a leading voice of
liberalism on the nation's highest court.
   Brennan, 84, said his ``advancing age and medical condition''
led to his decision to step down.
   His departure gives President Bush his first chance to name a
justice to the court, which has been deeply divided in recent years
on such issues as a woman's right to an abortion, affirmative
action and separation of church and state. Brennan has been a firm
advocate of all three.
   Bush told reporters that Brennan's decision had taken him by
surprise.
   ``Obviously, his resignation is accepted. I also thank him for
his distinguished service to the United States,'' the president
told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Washington from
Wyoming.
   Bush said he would meet with top aides Saturday morning to
``start the process of finding a successor,'' and already, outside
groups were seeking to influence his decision. The president said
that he wanted the best-qualified person for the post and was ``not
afraid of starting a nomination fight.''
   The president called Brennan during the flight, said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Fitzwater declined to say what was said
in the conversation.
   An anti-abortion group in Iowa looked forward to a new justice
who opposes abortion, while Eleanor Smeal, former president of the
National Organization of Women, said a potential justice's views on
the subject ``will be the key political issue of the 1990
senatorial elections.''
   Whatever the course of the confirmation process, Brennan's
brethren on the court rushed to praise him.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall said Brennan has been a ``voice of
caution and compassion in urging that this court not retreat from
its constitutional mission to protect individuals' rights of
freedom and expression, guarantee that minorities be free from
discrimination and to assure the rights of those accused of
crimes.''
   Justice Byron R. White, a member of the high court since 1962,
said, ``I enjoyed every day I spent with him. He is a great justice
and he will be remembered for that.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy hailed Brennan _ appointed by President
Eisenhower in 1956 _ as one of ``the greatest justices the country
has ever had.''
   Last April, just days before his 84th birthday, Brennan said he
was not dismayed by the court's growing conservatism and said would
not retire unless his health required it.
   ``I'm not discouraged to the point of giving up,'' he said.
``I'm not going to walk out and say the hell with it.''
   But Brennan suffered a small stroke after the term ended,
falling down in Newark Airport en route to a Scandinavian vacation,
said court spokeswoman Toni House. His doctor advised Brennan to
``avoid stress and strain and consider retiring,'' Ms. House said.
   In his letter to Bush, Brennan said, ``Strenuous demands of
court work and its related duties required or expected of a justice
appear at this time to be incompatible with my advancing age and
medical condition.''
   ``I, therefore, retire effectively immediately as an associate
justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.''
   Brennan suffered a small stroke in 1979 that left his right arm
and hand partially paralyzed and in 1978 underwent radiation
treatments for a cancerous tumor in his throat.
   He had said he considered retiring in 1979, burdened also by the
illness of his wife of 51 years. His wife, Marjorie, died of cancer
in 1982, and Brennan subsequently married his secretary of 25,
years, Mary Fowler.
   After his appointment by Eisenhower, Brennan quickly found a
home among the liberal majority led by Chief Justice Earl Warren.
   Along with fellow liberal Justice Marshall, Brennan has
maintained that the Constitution forbids the death penalty as cruel
and unusual punishment.
   Among the more than 1,200 opinions authored by Brennan are
landmarks that imposed a ``on-person, one-vote'' standard for
electing state legislatures, created constitutional protections for
libel lawsuit defendants and helped invent a legal definition of
obscenity.
   He remains among four justices on the court who wholeheartedly
support the court's 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
   Brennan said in a statement Friday that his retirement is ``a
very difficult decision after almost 34 years of service on the
court.''
   ``It is my hope that the court during my years of service has
built a legacy of interpretation of the Constitution and federal
laws to make them responsive to the needs of the people whom they
were intended to benefit and protect. This legacy can and will
withstand the test of time.''
   Brennan served under eight presidents. His departure is bound to
cause a dramatic change in the liberal-conservative balance at the
court.
   Only one justice in the court's history, William O. Douglas,
wrote more opinions. Only three served at a more advanced age:
Oliver Wendell Holmes, 91; Roger Taney, 87, and Hugo Black, 85.
   For more than three decades, Brennan has been a leading exponent
of liberalism and, by most accounts, a leading behind-the-scenes
strategist in helping mold liberal rulings and in later years in
preserving them on an increasingly conservative court.
   Although the court and its changing cast of justices grew more
conservative over the years, he remained a powerful force.
   Conservatives have consolidated their power and in most cases
command a 5-4 majority. But in several key areas liberals, led by
Brennan, have been able to win important victories.
   Just last month, with Brennan wrote for a five-member majority
that upheld the federal government's power to implement affirmative
action. The court upheld policies of the Federal Communications
Commission giving minorities special preference in the award of
broadcast licenses.
   Brennan's health has generally appeared good, despite his
advancing age. He was weakened badly by the flu this year but he
appeared to have recovered by the end of the term last month.
   At the time of his appointment, he was a member of the New
Jersey Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the Senate early in 1957
with only Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., voting against him.
McCarthy accused Brennan of being too soft on communism.
   A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law
School, he had practiced labor law in Newark before becoming a
state judge in 1949 and rising through the judicial ranks.

   On some of the Bolshoi Ballet's visits to the
United States, the evening of excerpts from ballets was the program
to avoid. Not this year.
   On Friday night, in a mixed bill at the New York State Theater,
the Bolshoi shone. There was good dancing and a mix of dance styles
plus variety in length of pieces presented.
   The most applause went to Nina Ananiashvili and Aleksei
Fadeyechev in the bravura ``Grand Pas'' from ``Don Quixote,''
choreographed by Alexander Gorsky. When he lifted her over his head
with one hand, the audience went wild. Yelena Borisova also was
excellent in her solo variation.
   Another spectacular pas de deux, from Marius Petipa's ``Le
Corsaire,'' was performed by Alla Mikhalchenko and Mark Peretokin.
His work in the air looked fantastic but his landings weren't
smooth.
   The much softer pas de deux from ``The Flower Festival at
Genzano,'' danced by Natalia Arkhipova and Yuri Klevtsov, was
programmed between the two flag wavers.
   Lyudmila Semenyaka and Yuri Posokhov danced the fairy and the
Scot in a pas de deux from a Bournonville masterpiece, ``La
Sylphide.''
   Yuri Vasyuchenko starred in ``The Appian Way'' scene from
``Spartacus'' choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich. He and his
shepherds and soldiers filled the stage with strong dancing and
emphatic masculinity.
   The evening began and ended with longer pieces. In the opener,
Mikhail Fokine's ``Petrushka,'' Mikhail Sharkov danced the title
role, showing a bit too much spunk as the pitiable puppet. It ended
with ``Paquita,'' choreographed by Petipa to showcase several
ballerinas. The leading one in this performance, Nina Semizorova,
doesn't make her movements flow. But ``Paquita,'' to gentle music
by Leo Minkus, contained much beauty.
   Aleksandre Kopylov conducted the New York City Opera Orchestra,
which has sounded marvelous through the two-week engagement.
   From here, the company will perform in Washington, Chicago, Los
Angeles, San Diego, Honolulu and Boston.

   President Bush thanked retiring Justice
William J. Brennan on Friday for his ``distinguished service'' in
34 years on the bench and said he would meet with advisers Saturday
to begin choosing a successor.
   Brennan's colleagues remembered him as ``a voice of caution and
compassion'' whose decisions over 34 years fought to preserve the
liberties of Americans.
   ``I greet the news of my brother Justice Brennan's departure
from the court with deep regret,'' Justice Thurgood Marshall said
in a statement. ``He is an eminent jurist whom no one can equal for
his breadth of knowledge, integrity and commitment to justice for
all humankind.
   ``Without doubt his opinions will go down in history as the
greatest of the court's.''
   Marshall was perhaps Brennan's closest collaborator on the
court. Both, for example, opposed the death penalty in all
circumstances. They voted to stop the execution of a Virginia man
Thursday night, but were outweighed by their colleagues.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said Brennan ``has made a
major contribution to American constitutional law. I hope his
retirement will enable him to relax from the cares of office and
restore his health.''
   Bush, who received a facsimile of Brennan's resignation as he
boarded Air Force One in Wyoming, said the announcement came ``as a
complete surprise.''
   ``The matter is now official and we will now start the process
of finding a successor,'' Bush said, adding that he would meet
Saturday at the White House with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
Chief of Staff John Sununu and White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray
to discuss a successor.
   Asked what judicial philosophy he would seek, Bush said, ``It's
too early to express anything of that nature. I've always said I
want somebody who will be on there not to legislate from the bench
but to faithfully interpret the Constitution, so that gives me a
wide latitude.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, ranked Brennan with Marshall and former justices Oliver
Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis as ``the greatest justices
this country ever had.''
   Brennan at 84 was the oldest justice and with more than 33 years
on the court was the senior in point of service.
   ``I am Justice Brennan's oldest colleague on the court and I
enjoyed every day I spent with him,'' Justice Byron White said.
   Marshall called him a ``treasured colleage and a dear friend. I
will miss his warm heart and kindred spirit.''
   ``Justice Brennan consistently has been a voice of caution and
compassion in urging that this court not retreat from its
constitutional mission to protect individuals' rights,'' he added.
   American Civil Liberties Union President Norman Dorsen said
Brennan's resignation would be ``an incalculable loss to the law
and civil liberties and to every person whose rights are threatened
in the United States.
   ``Justice Brennan has been a courageous, insightful and above
all humane jurist. He will not be easily replaced.''
   Brennan's replacement was the subject of immediate speculation
and jockeying by interest groups Friday night.
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said Friday was a ``very, very dark day.''
   ``I've been saying for months that the threat to our right to
choose is as close as the next Supreme Court appointment,'' she
said in an interview. ``Clearly this is a very serious loss for all
of us who value individual liberty and privacy rights.''
   The Iowa Right to Life Committee, however, said, ``The
appointment of one more justice who believes that all human life,
both born and unborn, deserves protection, will be the beginning
toward our country once again protecting preborn life.''
   The court has been split 5-4 recently on such heated political
issues as abortion and legal experts predicted the balance was
about to shift.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a member of the Judiciary Committee,
said that because of the frequent 5-4 votes, Brennan's resignation
``is a monumental change. It is important that President Bush make
an appointment that will not polarize the nation.''
   Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University, said,
``A lot of the 5-4 decisions that went the way Brennan voted are
likely to switch because I think it's likely that President Bush is
going to pick someone whose views differ from Brennan.''

   Here is a chronology of key events in the
Oliver North Iran-Contra case:
   1988&equals;
   March 16 _ North, former Reagan National Security Adviser John
M. Poindexter, former Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-American
businessman Albert Hakim are indicted.
   March 18 _ North announces his retirement from the Marine Corps,
says he may subpoena ``the highest ranking officials in our
government.''
   June 6 _ U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell orders separate
trials for the four defendants. Independent Counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh says the next day that North will go first.
   Nov. 7 _ One of 16 criminal counts against North, fabricating a
document, is dismissed.
   Nov. 21 _ Gesell says that if North stands trial, the court will
have little control over the testimony of witnesses ``acquainted
with high security matters.'' He appeals to President Reagan to
decide whether the government will allow the trial to take place.
   Nov. 29 _ Another count against North is dismissed: wire fraud.
   Dec. 1 _ Reagan rules out a North pardon but says ``duty
requires'' his administration to block release of secret documents
North wants for his trial.
   Dec. 12 _ Gesell tells North he can't use 3,500 secret documents
but can use more than 300, roughly the same number planned to be
introduced by the prosecution. The decision removes a major
obstacle to the trial going forward.
   Dec. 30 _ North subpoenas Reagan and President-elect Bush as
defense witnesses. Gesell, after Bush is sworn as president the
following month, rules he won't be called.
   1989&equals;
   Jan. 5 _ Prosecutors ask Gesell to dismiss conspiracy and theft
charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's
refusal to release material the judge ruled North would need.
Gesell later dismisses those counts.
   Twelve felony counts remain, including lying to Congress in 1985
and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Contras and lying to
the attorney general about the National Security Council's role in
diverting money from the Iran arms sales.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Secord, converting to his own
use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader Adolfo
Calero, and conspiring to defraud the government of tax revenue by
using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.
   Jan. 31 _ Jury selection begins.
   Feb. 21 _ The trial opens with prosecutor John Keker portraying
North as a liar who ``places himself above the law.'' Defense
lawyer Brendan Sullivan calls North a patriotic Marine who obeyed
the orders of his commander-in-chief.
   March 21 _ Security consultant Glenn Robinette testifies that
North let Secord pay for a security fence at his home and then
tried to cover up the deal after he left the White House.
   March 23 _ Fawn Hall, North's secretary at the White House,
tearfully testifies that he was a tireless and selfless boss and
their shredding of Iran-Contra documents ``was no big deal.''
   March 28 _ Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III testifies
administration officials were worried about impeachment of Reagan
after they discovered the Iran-Contra link.
   March 31 _ Gesell rejects North's request that he order Reagan
to testify, saying there is no proof the former president
authorized North to commit crimes.
   April 6 _ North takes the stand, saying he was merely a Marine
following White House orders.
   April 7 _ North concedes he lied to the House Intelligence
Committee at an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting at the White House at which
he denied providing assistance to the Contras.
   April 12 _ North testifies he thought he was protecting Reagan
when he altered Iran-Contra memos before investigators from the
Justice Department could get a look at them.
   April 18 _ Prosecutor Keker, in a hard-hitting summation, says,
``North and McFarlane were following Adolf Hitler's old strategy,
which is the victor will never be asked if he told the truth.''
   April 19 _ In an emotional closing argument, Sullivan says North
became a ``sacrificial lamb'' in the Reagan White House and was
fired to spare the former president political harm.
   May 4 _ North is convicted of falsifying and destroying
documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting in
the obstruction of Congress. He was acquitted of five other counts
of lying to or obstructing Congress, of lying to Meese, of
illegally converting traveler's checks to his own use and of
conspiring to defraud the IRS.
   June 30 _ Gesell denies a mistrial motion filed by the defense
on grounds that juror Tara Leigh King had falsely denied in a
questionnaire that she or her relatives had ever been involved in a
court proceeding or criminal investigation.
   July 5 _ Gesell sentences North to a suspended prison term and a
$150,000 fine for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. North is
placed on two years' probation and ordered to perform 1,200 hours
of community service administering a new program to help inner-city
youth avoid involvement in drugs.
   1990&equals;
   July 20, 1990 _ A federal appeals court sets aside North's
convictions, reversing the one on destroying documents and ordering
a hearing to see whether all three were impermissibly tainted by
congressional testimony that he gave under a grant of immunity.

   Here are excerpts from the U.S. Court of
Appeals decision in the Oliver North case, and from the dissenting
opinion by Chief Judge Patricia Wald.
   At trial, North was convicted on three of 12 counts: aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress (count 6), altering and
destroying National Security Council documents (count 9) and
accepting an illegal gratuity (count 10). The ``Kastigar'' case
referred to is a 1972 Supreme Court decision setting out safeguards
to make sure that someone forced to testify under a grant of
limited immunity is not convicted later as a result of his own
testimony, directly or indirectly.
   The appeals court panel said:
   ``Because of the length and complexity of our disposition of
North's appeal, we summarize our holdings.
   ``1. The District Court erred in failing to hold a full hearing
... to ensure that the IC (Independent Counsel) made no use of
North's immunized congressional testimony. North's convictions on
all three counts are therefore vacated and remanded to the District
Court. ...
   ``2. The District Court's jury instructions on count 9 were
erroneous in that they allowed the jury to convict without
unanimously concluding that North committed any one of the criminal
acts charged in count 9. ... This error mandates reversal of
North's conviction on count 9.
   ``3. The District Court did not err in refusing to instruct the
jury on the defense of authorization. ... The District Court did
err, however, in limiting the jury's consideration of authorization
evidence as that evidence was relevant to the issue of intent in
count 9. North's conviction on count 9 is therefore reversed.
   ``4. The District Court did not err in quashing North's subpoena
of former President Reagan, and the quashal did not violate North's
Sixth Amendment rights.
   ``5. The District Court erred by instructing the jury that, as a
matter of law, a congressional inquiry was `pending.' ... We
conclude, however that this error was harmless.
   ``6. Although the prosecution made highly improper remarks
during closing argument, the District Court did not err in refusing
to grant a new trial on that basis.
   ``7. The District Court's rulings with regard to the Classified
Information Procedures Act (`CIPA') did not violate the Due Process
Clause and were not otherwise erroneous.
   ``8. The credit given by the District Court to a juror's denial
of bias, even though the juror made false statements on the juror
questionnaire, was not erroneous and in no way prevented North from
exercising his peremptory challenges.
   ``9. The District Court did not err in declining to allow into
evidence an edited videotape of the congressional testimony of Adm.
John Poindexter, North's former superior at the NSC.
   ``10. The District Court did not violate the Jury Selection and
Service Act. (`JSSA.')
   ``11. Although the District Court may have been better advised
to use a different verdict form, the District Court did not
improperly foreclose a general verdict of guilty or not guilty on
counts 6 and 9.
   ``12. Other than with respect to the element of intent in count
9, the District Court committed no reversible error in its jury
instructions concerning the critical elements of each offense.
   ``13. Venue in the District of Columbia was proper for count 10.
   ``14. The District Court committed no error in allowing North to
be tried as an aider and abettor on count 6. ...
   ``The fact that a sizable number of grand jury witnesses, trial
witnesses and their aides apparently immersed themselves in North's
immunized testimony leads us to doubt whether what is in question
here is simply `stimulation' of memory by `a bit' of compelled
testimony. Whether the government's use of compelled testimony
occurs in the natural course of events or results from an
unprecedented aberration is irrelevant to a citizen's Fifth
Amendment right. ...
   ``From a prosecutor's standpoint, an unhappy byproduct of the
Fifth Amendment is that Kastigar may very well require a trial
within a trial (or a trial before, during or after the trial) if
such a proceeding is necessary for the court to determine whether
or not the government has in any fashion used compelled testimony
to indict or convict a defendant.
   ``We readily understand how court and counsel might sigh prior
to such an undertaking. Such a Kastigar proceeding could consume
substantial amounts of time, personnel and money, only to lead to
the conclusion that a defendant _ perhaps a guilty defendant _
cannot be prosecuted. Yet the very purpose of the Fifth Amendment
under these circumstances is to prevent the prosecutor from
transmogrifying into the inquisitor, complete with that officer's
most pernicious tool _ the power of the state to force a person to
incriminate himself. ...
   ``On remand, if the prosecution is to continue, the District
Court must hold a full Kastigar hearing that will inquire into the
content as well as the sources of the grand jury and trial
witnesses' testimony. That inquiry must proceed witness-by-witness;
if necessary, it will proceed line-by-line and item-by-item. For
each grand jury and trial witness, the prosecution must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that no use whatsoever was made of
any of the immunized testimony either by the witness or by the
Office of Independent Counsel in questioning the witness.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Wald, Chief Judge, dissenting ...
   ``Oliver North's was a case of epic proportions, massively
publicized, for many weeks engaging the rapt attention and emotions
of the nation. The panel today reverses his convictions on three
separate grounds, including a remand for an `item-by-item,
line-by-line' hearing on whether any bit of evidence, as yet
unidentified, may have reflected exposure to North's immunized
testimony before Congress.
   ``After studying for months the thousands of pages of
transcripts and hundreds of documents produced for the grand jury
and trial, I, on the other hand, am satisfied that North received a
fair trial _ not a perfect one but a competently managed and a fair
one. As in all trials of this magnitude, a few errors were made,
but in analyzing and researching North's claims, including the
three grounds on which the Per Curiam (court majority) reverses, I
do not find, singly or cumulatively, that any of them rose to the
status of reversible error. I am convinced that the essentials of a
fair trial were accorded North, and that his conviction on the
three counts of which the jury found him guilty should be
affirmed.''

   Even McDonald's couldn't bring fast food to Moscow.
   Hundreds of young Soviets are selling ``Beeg Maks'' as fast as
their hands can move, ricocheting off each other in the crush
behind the counter at the McDonald's less than a mile from the
Kremlin.
   But even 5,000 sandwiches an hour is not enough to satisfy
Soviet hunger for a taste of the West. The lunchtime line is 90
minutes and 1,200 people long.
   Six months after opening, the Golden Arches have eclipsed the
popularity of even Lenin's tomb, where a recent wait to see the
preserved body of the Soviet founder took only 20 minutes.
   ```Fee-lay-oh-feesh.' What's that?'' asked a grandmother as she
sounded out the Russian transliteration of a ``filet-o'-fish''
sandwich on a McDonald's brochure. A fresh-faced young McDonald's
staffer had given her the brochure when she joined the end of the
three-block line curling around the fountain and wrought-iron
lampposts of Pushkin Square.
   Entrepreneurs hawked their wares along the line. One ruble for a
Latvian humor newspaper, just 25 times the price of Pravda. Or 25
rubles for an application to immigrate to the United States. The
stack of blank paperwork is available free to anyone willing to
stand in another line at the Embassy.
   Inside, the sheer volume has taken its toll. A milkshake is
served melted, and the Big Mac is a bit flat because iceberg
lettuce doesn't curl quite the same when grown under glass in these
northern latitudes.
   But the fries were salty and golden, a straw stood in a second
shake and Soviets found lettuce wondrous enough, without worrying
about its ability to fluff up a sandwich.
   Four hours into their day, few of the 250 young people cooking
and manning 27 cash registers managed obligatory McDonald's smiles,
but all were unfailingly polite. For Soviets accustomed to snarling
clerks slopping out cafeteria hash, this is nothing short of
unbelievable.
   ``We really like the service,'' said a smiling Irina Borunova,
who came to Moscow from the town of Murom, 150 miles to the east,
with her husband and small son.
   ``It's so clean! Not like a Soviet restaurant,'' marveled Nina
Balitskaya, a student teacher who admitted to having braved the
line 15 times.
   For Galina Voyevodkina of Moscow, the queue and the prices were
just too much.
   ``For this kind of money, I could sit in a real restaurant and
be served,'' she pointed out. ``And it's not fast. I had to stand
in line for an hour and a half.''
   A Big Mac costs 3.75 rubles, or a little over two hours' pay for
the average Soviet. Restaurants in state hotels charge two to three
rubles for a entree, while private Soviet restaurants may demand 10
to 50 rubles.
   Already, McDonald's has spawned a Soviet clone. Across town on
Taganka Square, the same yellow and red colors spell out
``Gamburger Kafe.'' That is the Russian transliteration of
hamburger, because the language has no letter ``H.''
   The small cafe abandons the usual Soviet restaurant gloom in
favor of its competitor's idea of allowing sunlight to stream
through the windows. The decor is typically Soviet with five
clashing patterns of ceramic tile.
   The ``gamburgers'' arrive in unusually fresh and crusty buns,
served with white cheese, onions, green pepper and cucumber _
Soviet approximations of the cheddar cheese, onions, lettuce and
pickles that McDonald's found only by building its own $50 million
Moscow food factory.
   ``Gamburgers'' are fairly fast, served to a line of five people
in just minutes. But they're stone cold.
   McDonald's figured the demand would be overwhelming when it
opened Moscow's first taste of the West six months ago. But
managers were stunned when the volume hit 30,000 meals a day. Now,
it's more than 50,000. The restaurant is the chain's biggest and
busiest.
   To deal with it, the staff has nearly doubled from 630 to 1,100,
said operations supervisor Glenn Steeves from McDonald's of Canada,
which operates the restaurant in a joint venture with the city of
Moscow.
   The crush and resulting staff expansion also created dozens of
unexpected openings for front-line supervisors and an unforseen
boon. Suddenly, McDonald's promise of fast promotion for peak
performance was a reality _ and a marvelous incentive to stay
working hard and honestly.
   Karina Pogosova, 21, said she had been hired as a regular crew
member for the opening in January and in six months had been
promoted to shift supervisor on the counter, overseeing 40 to 45
staffers. Her salary has more than doubled, from the 250 rubles a
month McDonald's starting wage _ about average for Soviet workers _
to 550 rubles.
   Even Soviet staffers had expressed worry when McDonald's opened
that it would lose a fortune to staff theft, considered by many
Soviets a more important benefit than salary. But Steeves said
clear warnings of prosecution and strict accounting have worked.
   ``We count every bun, every patty, every pickle,'' he said.
``It's not a problem.''

   While Muscovites waited in long lines at the
Red Square McDonald's, Americans were able to belly up to the
counter and order piroshkis without waiting at the first Soviet
fast-food eatery in the United States.
   The Friday lunch-hour crowd at Piroshkis in the Waterside
Festival Marketplace was slow. While many of the fast-food
franchises in the development's food court were moderately busy,
there was no waiting for service at the eatery, which opened in
April.
   Its owners said last week that business has been ``gratifying,''
but the joint Soviet-American firm does not release sales figures.
   A piroshki is a deep-fried pastry stuffed with potatoes and
mushrooms, beef and rice, or fish.
   The counter, which opened in April, also serves Russian
varieties of pancakes, donuts, coffee and tea.

<HEAD>Turin Concert Canceled; Crew Delayed By Quarrel In Other Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock star Prince has canceled a concert in Turin
after his manager said the tour's crew was delayed at an earlier
show in southern Italy, where local promoters parked forklifts in
their way because of a quarrel.
   A police official said the argument was over money.
   Prince's manager, Randy Phillips of Stiefel-Phillips
Entertainment, said the Friday concert in Turin was canceled
because he claimed the crew was threatened and roughed up by local
promoters after a show in Cava de' Tirreni, 150 miles south of
Rome. Police denied there was violence.
   ``Acts of physical abuse were committed'' against the crew after
the Wednesday night concert at a stadium, Phillips said in a
statement distributed by Prince's Paisley Park studios of
Minneapolis. He did not elaborate.
   In addition, forklifts were moved in front of the stadium's
exits to restrict the crew's movement, he was quoted as saying,
preventing the crew to get to Turin in northern Italy in time for
the Friday show.
   But the police superintendent in Cava de' Tirreni, Giuseppe
Fortunato, said no violence took place after the concert Wednesday
night and only an argument occurred Thursday morning, when the crew
was leaving.
   ``It was resolved tranquilly, and that was it,'' he said in a
telephone interview. He added that the argument was over ``a
question of money'' but said he had no details, and Philipps could
not be reached fo comment.
   The home telephone of the local organizer was unlisted and
efforts to reach him Friday evening were unsuccessful.
   Prince, on his Nude Tour of Europe, is known for his hits that
include Purple Rain, Controversy, and Little Red Corvette.

<HEAD>House Was Hiding Log Cabin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING PRAIRIE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calvin Hostetler had long suspected
his home was hiding a historical secret. This summer, he began
tearing the building down and discovered he was right.
   Hidden within the thick walls of the condemned house about 18
miles west of South Bend was a small log cabin in near-perfect
condition.
   The cabin has one tiny main room and two even smaller side
rooms. Underneath is a cellar lined with stones that Hostetler
estimates weigh 20 to 25 tons.
   A preliminary search by Fern Schultz, president of the LaPorte
County Historical Society, revealed the land was purchased by a
Tobias Miller on Aug. 12, 1833.
   Settlers began building cabins and clearing land in the area in
the late 1820s, but Mrs. Schultz said records do not indicate when
the cabin might have been built.
   ``There's no way of proving that Miller built the cabin,'' she
said Thursday. ``Whether he was a land speculator or a farmer, I
don't know.''
   Hostetler lived in the house in the mid-1970s. He suspected that
a log cabin was inside the thick walls because he had seen the
uncovered logs in an entry way in the house.
   After the county condemned the building, he began dismantling it.
   Finding a cabin within a home is unusual as most log structures
were destroyed in the construction of newer homes, Mrs. Schultz
said.
   Hostetler said he plans to ``probably show it to the public.
We've had a lot of interest in it, with people asking to look over
it.''
   Mrs. Schultz said the historical society would continue to
examine its records seeking clues to the cabin's history.

   Prince Charles has donated the plaster cast from
his broken arm to help raise cash to repair the roof of a country
church damaged in storms, a church official said.
   The Prince of Wales broke his arm June 28 in a fall during a
polo match.
   ``After the accident, I woke up in the middle of the night and
decided to ask the prince if he would give us the cast,'' said Reg
Little.
   He is warden of the Church of St. Thomas of Canterbury in
Kingswear, Devon, which suffered $25,000 worth of damage in
February's storms.
   ``I wrote a letter and went to the gate of Highgrove (the
prince's Gloucestershire residence), but there was no letterbox and
no one about. So I threw the letter over the gate,'' he said.
   The prince's private secretary got in touch a week later, saying
Charles agreed to donate the cast, Little said.
   He said the cast will either be auctioned or put up as a prize
in a drawing.

<DATELINE>BENEATH THE GULF OF MAINE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the yellow submersible Delta
slips beneath the Gulf of Maine 22 miles off Massachusetts, bubbles
form outside the portholes and the craft enters a different world.
   The tiny, two-person sub skims the sea floor, scattering fish
and moving noiselessly through rocky canyons. This
once-in-a-lifetime experience 200 feet underwater is part of a
program for high school students, designed to bring the reality of
the ocean and the environment up close.
   ``Don't be scared!'' the pilot barks at a reporter as the sub
hits the edge of a sharp ledge and bounces off backwards into a
murky crevasse. ``It sounds bad but nothing's gonna break.''
   As the sub meanders along the bottom, a new kingdom slowly comes
to life. Vivid pink and red stems of algae rising from the rough
sand flutter eerily like lone, long-stemmed roses. Ivory-colored
sponges decorate black craggy rocks.
   Flounder swim lazily by the portholes. An enormous skate, lying
flat along the bottom like a gray throw rug, heaves awake under the
bright flood lights of the sub and circles the craft in apparent
irritation.
   The High School Aquanaut program is an opportunity for high
school students and their teachers to participate in real undersea
research in the Gulf of Maine, the waters off southern New England,
the mid-Atlantic Bight and the Laurentian Great Lakes.
   ``I couldn't believe what I was seeing,'' said Mary Wohlleber,
17, who will be a freshman at Eastern Connecticut State University
next year, and has made two dives. ``It makes you appreciate the
ocean more. You're there doing the work firsthand and until you do
it firsthand you don't respect the animals or their environment.''
   The program is sponsored by the federally-funded National
Undersea Foundation at the University of Connecticut. At present,
the students are from southeastern Connecticut high schools but
there are plans to bring in inner-city students from New York next
year.
   ``There's no better way to get youngsters excited about the
ocean and the environment than to make them diving scientists,''
said Richard A. Cooper, director of the National Undersea Research
Center.
   It's safe, too. The Delta has made 1,969 dives with no
accidents. The sub is made of reinforced steel equipped with the
same type of battery in a golf cart. It can go to 1,200 feet
maximum without pressurized air.
   Students in the program, now in its third year, take part in
ongoing research experiments. They are selected on a competitive
basis from their schools and plan their individual projects with
their teachers and program coordinators before they go to sea.
   ``It was the experience of a lifetime,'' 17-year-old Brad Martin
said. ``The views, the crew, being in a place that not many others
are able to travel and explore. The program has been a dream come
true.''
   In the so-called Pigeon Hill area at Jeffrey's Ledge off
Gloucester, students help marine biologists measure the pollution
content in scallops, which in turn determines the contaminant level
in surface sediments. They deploy scallop cages on certain dives
and later retrieve them with the aid of the mechanical arm of the
Delta.
   ``We want to make them see that it takes only a short time to
pollute the planet and several thousand years to reverse the
process,'' said Cooper.
   The data gleaned from the scallop samples also has a larger
significance, according to Bill Robinson, a marine biologist with
the New England Aquarium and a program coordinator.
   ``We know more about corn in the Midwest than we do about fish
in the ocean,'' he said. ``That's why we can harvest corn so well.
We don't know anything about scallops but once we know about their
reproduction cycles, it'll make all the difference.''
   Performer Richie Havens was aboard the research vessel J.W.
Powell this week as it left Gloucester with a group of scientists
and teachers to discover firsthand how the program works.
   Havens, 49, who grew up in Brooklyn, works with underprivileged
students in New York City in addition to his singing career. He
helped found the Northwind Undersea Institute for children on City
Island in the Bronx. He also heads the Natural Guard, based in
Washington, D.C., a program which offers inner-city youth a chance
to experience other environments.
   ``I was a city kid and city kids need a place to go away from
the concrete,'' said Havens, who will be bringing students into the
program next year. ``We're trying to raise their consciousness
about their environment by showing them something they wouldn't
otherwise see.''
   Coordinators from the National Undersea Foundation hope the
program will expand nationwide.

   Prosecutors have brought a man to
trial on charges he incited his wife to commit suicide.
   William Mijssen, spokesman for Amsterdam district court, told
The Associated Press Friday that the defendant allegedly abused his
wife physically and psychologically for two years before her April
1988 suicide.
   The trial began Thursday and is based on an 1884 law which
prohibits giving assistance in a suicide attempt.
   According to press reports, the 31-year-old defendant, a
Surinamese-born Hindu, whipped, kicked and stomped on his wife
during the period before she committed suicide at age 23 by
drinking high-strength cooking vinegar.
   Mijssen refused to disclose the names of the defendant or victim
in accordance with Dutch court practice.
   If convicted, the defendant could face a maximum three-year
prison sentence.

<TEXT>
   Clint Eastwood can press forward with a $20
million lawsuit against a Florida-based tabloid newspaper that
reported he was threatened by neo-Nazis, a judge has ruled.
   Eastwood contends a Jan. 2 article in The Globe was false and
caused him mental anguish by making him fear for his life. The
lawsuit also alleges ``false-light invasion of privacy,'' meaning
the article portrayed the actor falsely, said Anthony Glassman, an
attorney for the tabloid.
   Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow on Friday turned down a request
by Glassman to dismiss the lawsuit, and gave the defendants 20 days
to respond to the allegations.
   The Globe stands by the story's accuracy, Glassman said.
   ``Our position was simply that to be the enemy of American Nazis
is not a bad thing. It's not offensive,'' Glassman said.
   It could be a year before the case goes to trial, he said.
   The Globe reported under a headline ``Nazi Thugs Put Bounty on
Clint _ But Dirty Harry Won't Lay Low'' that Eastwood had received
death threats and that a $100,000 bounty was placed on his life
after he refused to speak at a convention of the Aryan Nations, a
white supremacy group.

<HEAD>GOP Seeks Clear Position on Tax Increases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans are scrambling to find a
clear position on tax increases as congressional Democrats and
President Bush duel over who is to blame for swelling budget
deficits.
   Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said Friday that he is
unsure how many Republicans will ultimately support a
deficit-reduction package that includes tax increases.
   ``I don't know that anything is clearly definitive. We haven't
come up with a package yet,'' Michel told reporters.
   In more than two months of bargaining, administration and
congressional budget negotiators have been unable to agree to $50
billion in tax increases and spending cuts for the 1991 fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1.
   Their talks were rocked Wednesday when the House's 176-member
GOP caucus voted informally to oppose ``new taxes and all tax rate
increases as a means of reducing the federal budget deficit.''
   But the next day, the No. 2 House Republican, Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia _ who supported the GOP resolution _ told
fellow budget negotiators that he could ``sponsor and support'' a
compromise that includes spending cuts and tax increases.
   Gingrich and Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, who sponsored the GOP
resolution, said there was nothing inconsistent about their
positions. Gingrich said he voted for Armey's resolution.
   ``I presented the resolution as our policy position, and I
didn't present it as one that bound any individual member's vote,''
Armey said.
   ``I'd not expect to agree to a budget package that wouldn't get
a substantial number of House Republican votes,'' Gingrich said.
   But Democrats said they do not know where Republicans stand on
the question of taxes.
   ``They ought to resolve that and let us know who's in charge,''
said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Bentsen, his party's 1988 vice presidential candidate, was one
of several Democrats who criticized Bush on Friday for pointing his
finger at them for causing the deficit problem.
   ``That's incredible,'' Bentsen said when told that Bush had
blamed the Democratic ``stranglehold on Congress'' for continuing
budget shortfalls.
   Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, who is No. 3 in the House
Democratic leadership, said Bush's comments at a GOP fund-raising
breakfast Friday were an example of ``usual election-year
hyperbole.''
   He said the president was ignoring a national debt that has
grown from less than $1 trillion when Bush became vice president in
1981 to more than $3.1 trillion today.
   ``It's tantamount to the captain of the Titanic saying, `Don't
blame me, blame the crew, I just happen to be here,''' Gray said.
   Foley called Bush's remarks ``a partisan speech for a partisan
audience for a partisan purpose.''
   Bentsen accused the Bush and Reagan administrations of ``eight
years of $200 billion hot checks,'' a reference to budget gaps that
have surpassed $200 billion annually in some recent years.
   ``Some of us have been saying this should be turned around, and
the administration has not done so,'' he said.
   In his remarks in Billings, Mont., Bush said Democratic control
of Congress _ which has lasted 29 of the last 35 years _ has gone
on long enough.
   ``We must end this `deficits don't matter' mentality,'' he said.
   The fiscal 1991 deficit is expected to be $169 billion, not
counting the tens of billions of dollars it will cost to rescue the
savings and loan industry.

   The Mexican government wants a U.S. drug agent
arrested and extradited to Mexico to face charges that he kidnapped
a Mexican doctor wanted in the 1985 slaying of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   The Mexican Embassy delivered two diplomatic notes to the State
Department on Friday seeking the arrest of DEA agent Hector
Berrellez and DEA informant and former Mexican police officer
Antonio Garate, said spokesman Antonio Ocaranza.
   Ocaranza said his government wants the two extradited to face
charges that they kidnapped Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who was
taken from his Guadalajara office and delivered to El Paso, Texas,
where he was arrested by DEA agents April 3.
   The U.S. government has denied that any laws were broken in the
arrest of Alvarez, one of 19 Mexicans indicted in Los Angeles on
charges of kidnapping, torturing and killing Camarena in February
1985.
   There was no immediate response to the request, Ocaranza said.
   DEA spokesman Bill Ruzzamenti said, ``This is somewhat of a
unique situation, so we don't have a lot of precedent to deal
with.''
   The State Department will study the request and determine what
should be done, Ruzzamenti said.
   The State and Justice departments had no immediate comment on
how the government plans to respond to the Mexican request.
   Alvarez is accused of administering drugs to Camarena after the
DEA was kidnapped in Mexico in 1985.
   The delivery of Alvarez has caused tension between the U.S. and
Mexican governments. Mexico has demanded his return, claiming the
incident violated Mexican sovereignty.
   However, Justice Department officials said there are no plans to
return Alvarez to Mexico.
   Alvarez, a gynecologist, testified in Los Angeles in May that he
was brought to the United States against his will and that he was
tortured with electronic equipment and hit in the stomach while
being abducted.
   Garate testified in Los Angeles that he arranged for friends in
Mexico to spirit Alvarez across the border, and that the plan was
approved by Berrellez, his DEA supervisor.
   He said he told his friends that he would pay all their
expenses, although no money would be provided up front and no
assistance from the DEA. In addition, Garate testified that he
specified that Alvarez should not be harmed during the operation.
   The U.S. government initially denied that it had paid any money
for the delivery of Alvarez to U.S. soil.
   But in late May, the government acknowledged that it paid at
least $20,000 to the people who brought Alvarez to El Paso.
Berrellez testified that up to $50,000 in reward money had been
authorized by DEA headquarters in Washington.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in May he was not
concerned about the circumstances of Alvarez's delivery to U.S.
territory and he invited Mexican authorities to turn over more
people wanted in the Camarena case in the same way.

<HEAD>Government Report Doubts Plant Should Ever Be Restarted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The future of a plutonium processing plant in
Washington state is in new doubt with a report that questions
whether the government facility should ever be restarted in view of
safety concerns and changing defense policy.
   The General Accounting Office said in a report made public
Friday that the Department of Energy has failed to prove that the
PUREX plant at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation is needed to produce
plutonium or assist in the management of radioactive wastes.
   ``DOE has not demonstrated that a need exists for the remaining
weapons-grade plutonium that could be extracted, and it has not
fully compared PUREX with other waste processing alternatives to
determine whether PUREX is the best approach,'' the congressional
investigative agency said.
   The plant was shut in December 1988 because of recurring safety
problems.
   ``DOE's plans for restarting PUREX are inadequate,'' said the
report requested by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the House
Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and
natural resources.
   ``A more important question is whether PUREX should be restarted
at all given the costs to operate PUREX, in combination with the
costs to prepare a supplemental environmental statement, the time
and costs associated with correcting identified safety and training
deficiencies ... and the possibility that a better alternative
exists to dispose the fuel-grade plutonium,'' the study said.
   DOE spokesman Tim Tomastik said Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins had not seen the GAO report and would have no immediate
comment. However, Tomastik said there appeared to be some false
assumptions in the recommendations.
   ``It makes the assumption that DOE has made a decision about
restarting PUREX. The DOE has not made a decision at this time with
respect to whether or not to restart PUREX,'' Tomastik said.
   Synar said Friday his subcommittee estimates that putting the
plant in mothballs would save the government more than $750 million
over the next 15 years.
   ``Given the Bush administration's decision to cancel the Special
Isotope Separation plant in Idaho, which was expected to use the
plutonium produced by the PUREX plant, the long-term plutonium
production mission at PUREX has disappeared,'' Synar said.
   The DOE-owned, contractor-operated facility near Richland,
Wash., formally known as the Plutonium-Uranium Extraction plant
began operation in 1956.
   Its main function has been to reprocess spent uranium fuel rods
from Hanford's now-closed nuclear materials production reactor, the
N-reactor. The process involves dissolving the rods in acid and
extracting plutonium that can be used in making nuclear weapons.

   One of the government's chief witnesses in
Mayor Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial has ties to the family
of a convicted Washington drug lord, Barry's chief lawyer says.
   Attorney R. Kenneth Mundy contended Friday that Charles Lewis
was far from the small-time drug peddler he claimed to be.
   Instead, Lewis, a twice-convicted drug dealer, ``was trying to
strike a bargain and connection for a much larger drug enterprise''
with Rayful Edmond.
   The confusion began there. Did Mundy mean Rayful Edmond Jr., or
Rayful Edmond III?
   The distinction is important.
   Rayful Edmond III is serving two consecutive life terms in
prison, plus an additional sentence of 99 years, for convictions on
a host of drug-related charges.
   Prosecutors said the younger Edmond was responsible for
distributing between 20 percent and 30 percent of the cocaine in
the nation's capital during the height of his operation.
   Witnesses testified in the younger Edmond's trial that the elder
Edmond was also involved with drugs, but he has never been charged
with a crime.
   The ties between Lewis and Edmond's family came out as Mundy
questioned an FBI agent about notes he had taken during
interrogations of Lewis last summer.
   Lewis, a key government witness against Barry, has described
himself as a drug user who was only marginally involved in drug
dealing. But Mundy said the notes from the interview show that
Lewis had once brought his drug cohorts together with Rayful Edmond
Jr.
   Did his notes mention anything about ``He (Lewis) and Sonny
(Whatley) and (James) McWilliams hooking up with a very notorious
D.C. drug dealer?'' Mundy asked FBI agent Michael Mason.
   Before Mason could answer, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson ordered the jury and the witness out of the courtroom.
   After the courtroom was cleared, Mundy zeroed in on the notes,
without making clear which Edmond he believed Lewis had been
referring to.
   ``Charles Lewis said (to the FBI agents) that he hooked up with
Rayful Edmond,'' Mundy said.
   Mundy also brought up notes from a party in which one Rayful
Edmond had brought cocaine for Lewis and his friends to sample.
   But in a bench conference, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith
Retchin stressed that the man referred to in the notes was the
father of the convicted drug dealer.
   Retchin also insisted that in another interview, Lewis had said
he knew of the younger Edmond ``only through the newspapers.''
   The confusion was exacerbated by Barry, who said outside court
that his attorney had meant Rayful Edmond III.
   ``He was talking about the one who had a long trial,'' Barry
said with a smile.
   Mundy said he brought up the subject to impeach the testimony of
Lewis. But after a lengthy debate, Jackson ruled that Mundy could
only do so if he called Lewis as a witness.
   Mundy then said he expected the government to make Lewis
available for questioning.
   Earlier, one of Barry's security guards testified that he never
saw Barry use drugs during a 1988 trip to the Virgin Islands. Lewis
has testified that he, Barry and others smoked $300 worth of crack
cocaine during the mayor's four-day stay.
   However, the guard, Ulysses Walltower, acknowledged under
cross-examination that he was not around Barry during the times
Lewis has testified drugs were used.
   Barry, 54, is being tried on 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three felony
counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.

<TEXT>
   The administration is moving to make sure an
industrial furnace capable of casting metal parts for nuclear
weapons is not delivered to the government of Iraq, officials say.
   The Commerce Department has asked the New Jersey furnace
manufacturer to apply for a special export license for ``items that
have some sort of nuclear application,'' a State Department
official said Friday.
   ``This license would be very difficult to get,'' said the
official, who is familiar with interagency discussions on the
furnace export and spoke on condition of anonymity.
   One of the furnaces has been detained by U.S. Customs officials
at Philadelphia since June 26 at the Pentagon's request.
   The Iraqi government said it was purchasing the furnace to cast
lightweight titanium for artificial hip and knee joints for victims
of the Iran-Iraq war. However, U.S. officials fear it could use the
furnace for weapons production.
   ``Certain furnaces can be used for casting components for
weapons and missiles,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said Friday, noting she was prohibited from discussing
details of the case.
   Raymond J. Roberts, president of Consarc Corp. of Rancocas,
N.J., said earlier this week that the Commerce Department advised
the company more than a year ago that only a general license was
necessary for the export of the furnaces. He was reported out of
the office and unavailable Friday.
   One White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said it appeared the so-called validated export license would not
be granted.
   He said he believed the license decision was made through an
interagency review involving the Commerce, State and Defense
departments and the National Security Council staffs, but not any
senior White House officials.
   British and American officials have seized other cargoes this
year suspected of containing weapons components for Iraq.
   In March, British customs officials stopped American-made
electronic devices they said would be used by the Iraqis as nuclear
weapons triggers. The following month, British officials stopped an
Iraq-bound shipment of parts they suspected would be used for a
giant gun.

<HEAD>Frank Accepts Reprimand Call; House Debate Set For Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., is accepting an
ethics committee recommendation that he be reprimanded for his
relationship with a male prostitute as the House girds for a debate
next week on Frank's fate.
   The panel unanimously reported Friday that aspects of Frank's
relationship with Stephen L. Gobie ``reflected discredit upon the
House'' and recommended he be reprimanded before the full House
next week.
   A short time later, Frank told reporters in Newton, Mass.: ``I
accept the judgment of the committee report.''
   It will be up to the House to decide whether to accept the
committee report or impose a more severe punishment, such as
censure or even expulsion.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., promised a public debate by
next week but predicted Frank would survive the storm.
   ``I think this matter will be soon put behind us,'' Foley said.
``Barney Frank remains one of the most effective and, I think
throughout the House, highly regarded members here.''
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., is expected to try to force
expulsion of Frank, a daunting task because it would require a
two-thirds vote by the Democratic-controlled House. But the
conservative lawmaker would not concede that point.
   ``Who knows?'' Dannemeyer responded when asked about his
chances. ``Every member is going to have to vote his or her
conscience.''
   At least two Republicans say Frank should face a censure, which
is a more severe punishment than reprimand because it would require
Frank to stand before his colleagues while a resolution condemning
his activities is read.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he expected that Republicans would
push for censure. And Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis., a member of the
ethics panel, said he would argue for a sterner punishment. Petri
said he agreed to the committee recommendation for a reprimand to
preserve the panel's tradition of making its decisions unanimously.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., the ethics committee chairman,
defended the recommendation. ``Barney Frank will certainly not
consider it a slap on the wrist,'' he said. ``The committee
certainly does not consider it a slap on the wrist.''
   Frank, one of two acknowledged homosexuals in the House,
rejected the notion that he had received lenient treatment from the
committee. ``I don't think they'd say they're being soft on me,''
Frank said.
   Gobie, meanwhile, told Boston radio station WEEI he was pleased
the committee was not harder on Frank.
   Frank paid Gobie $80 for sex and then hired him in July 1985 as
a housekeeper and driver, paying him with personal funds. Frank
says he ended the relationship in August 1987 after learning that
Gobie was operating a sex-for-hire ring out of the lawmaker's
Capitol Hill apartment.
   The ethics committee, which has been investigating the case
since last Sept. 11, concluded that Frank improperly fixed parking
tickets _ some of them accumulated by Gobie using Frank's car on
personal business.
   And the panel said Frank ``set in motion'' a memo containing
misleading information about Gobie sent to a Virginia prosecutor
and ``which could have affected Mr. Gobie's probation'' after prior
felony convictions.

   Post-communist Czechoslovakia's military
chief, concluding a U.S. visit, says withdrawal of Soviet forces
from his country will be completed by the end of March 1991.
   Withdrawal of Red Army units in Czechoslovakia since the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion is a complex process but is on schedule and is
being monitored by the democratically elected parliament, Lt. Gen.
Anton Slimak told a news conference Friday.
   He was summarizing information he said he provided Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and other officials at a series of Pentagon
meetings.
   Slimak became chief of the Czechoslovak general staff after last
December's peaceful revolution ended four decades of communist rule
in his homeland. A graduate of the Soviet Union's Voroshilov
General Staff Academy, he is also deputy defense minister in the
post-election government.
   During a week-long tour of major bases on the Atlantic seaboard,
Slimak said, he and his aides learned much about U.S. military
spirit _ from democratic principles to pride of command _ that ``we
will be trying to apply in the reorganization of our armed forces.''
   U.S. Army units are based in neighboring West Germany, and now
``we think of them as our neighbors,'' Slimak said.
   He described as ``an optimal solution'' the new agreement
between West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev for reunited Germany to belong to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``The Warsaw Pact still has a purpose for the near future, and
we believe that after its demise and with the new security
arrangements in place, (Czechoslovak) membership in NATO would make
no sense,'' Slimak said.
   He and his staff visited MacDill Air Force Base, Florida; Fort
Bragg and Camp LeJeune Marine Base in North Carolina, and Langley
Air Force Base in Virginia. They plan to tour Canadian military
bases next week.

   President Bush welcomed the reversal of one of
Oliver North's Iran-Contra convictions, calling it ``good news.''
   ``I just feel good about it,'' Bush said of the court victory
for the former Reagan administration National Security Council aide.
   Bush made his first comment on the appeals court ruling Friday
night as he flew back to Washington from Cheyenne, Wyo.
   ``I think this is good news. I have not wanted to see the North
matter go any further,'' the president said.
   ``My view is Ollie North _ I've said I don't want to comment
while it's in the (court) system, so maybe I ought to get back to
that _ but I felt a certain sense of pleasure that he has been in
some sense relieved of one of these charges. I just feel good about
it,'' he said.
   The divided appeals court panel reversed one of North's
convictions and ordered a lower court to determine whether North's
trial was tainted by congressional testimony he gave under a grant
of immunity.
   North was convicted in May 1989 on three of 12 counts stemming
from the Reagan administration's clandestine effort to sell arms to
Iran and aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The divided three-judge panel reversed North's conviction on the
charge of altering and destroying sensitive NSC documents, finding
that U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell gave erroneous instructions
to the jury.
   North also was convicted of accepting an illegal gratuity and
aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress.

<HEAD>Study Concludes Space Station May Require Up To 10 Space Walks A
Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 10 spacewalks a week will be needed to
maintain outside components of the proposed Space Station Freedom
unless there are major design changes, a study says.
   The study, by astronaut Bill Fisher and Johnson Space Center
engineer Charles Price and released Friday, showed that in peak
maintenance years with the present space station design, two
astronauts working together would have to spend up to 6,462 hours a
year in space suits repairing and replacing parts.
   Other years, the maintenance would require fewer space walks,
the study said, but over the 35-year lifetime of the station the
time spent on repair space walks would average about 3,276
astronaut-hours a year. This would amount to 273 two-person space
walks a year, or 5.3 a week.
   Each space walk takes about six hours.
   Fisher and Price said that the number space walks could be
reduced by up to half if more work can be done by robots that could
be controlled from inside the space station or from the ground.
   Simplifying repair tasks and making all parts replaceable by
robots could drop the total annual space walk hours to 507, a
number that Fisher said would be manageable.
   NASA has been criticized by Congress for designing a space
station that would require so much maintenance, so much so that
much of the time of at least two astronauts on board would be spent
on repairs and parts replacement.
   The current plan calls for eight-member crews.
   Richard Kohrs, director of the space station program, said that
design of the station is now undergoing a major review and that
each of the recommendations in the Fisher-Price study will be
evaluated.
   He said changes are being made that will cut down on the weight,
power use and maintenance of the station.
   Reducing the number of space walks, he said, is a major goal.
   ``We're going to build the space station for science research,''
Kohrs said at a news conference Friday. ``If you are spending a
major part of your time on EVA (extra vehicular activity or space
walks), then you are taking that away from science.''
   NASA executives had ordered the space walk study to coincide
with the space station design review. Kohrs said the purpose of the
study was to spot problems so that corrections can be made before
construction of station parts begins.
   Assembly of the space station is expected to begin in about
three years and it is expected to be permanently occupied by 1996.
   The station is expected to cost about $30 billion and last about
35 years. NASA has said the station is critical to the agency's
future plans to explore the moon and to voyage to Mars.
   The Fisher-Price report said that a major problem to overcome is
the number of hours of space walking required to maintain the
station while it is being assembled. The station will be put
together with a series of 18 flights by the space shuttle, and
parts of the station will spend months in orbit before it is
permanently occupied by astronauts.
   During that 30-month assembly period, the report said, there
will be a need for 6,267 hours of maintenance by spacewalking
astronauts. This equals about four two-man spacewalks a week.
   ``All of these would have to be done from the space shuttle,''
said Fisher.
   Another study, started after the Fisher-Price team made a
preliminary report in the spring, concluded with estimates close to
those of Fisher and Price. The study, led by William Simon of the
Johnson Space Center, said, however, that with changes in design,
the spacewalks required to maintain the station could be reduced to
about 485 man-hours a year.

   Women's and homosexual rights organizations
praised a liberal District of Columbia law that provides employees
with up to four months unpaid family and medical leave.
   Meanwhile, the business community vowed to lobby against the
bill in Congress, saying it would severely hurt the city's small

   ``This is a very compassionate piece of legislation designed to
protect those who are often most vulnerable _ working women, gays,
children, the elderly,'' said Ivy Young, spokeswoman for the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   Claudia Withers, spokeswoman for the Women's Legal Defense Fund,
a public policy advocacy group that monitors laws dealing with
family and women's issues, said although ``paid leave is best ...
we think it'll be the best in the nation.''
   The legislation would apply to full-time and part-time workers
who want leave to care for a ``family member,'' including newborns,
ill relatives or partners in ``committed relationships.'' It would
also provide up to 16 weeks of unpaid leave if the employee is
suffering from a serious health condition.

<HEAD>House Adopts Bill To Help States Meet Education Goals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is agreeing to help states meet
national education goals set by President Bush and the governors.
   The bill, approved on Friday 350-25, authorizes $1 billion in
new federal education spending in fiscal 1991 and a total of $5.3
billion over the next five years for education initiatives.
   The House also voted overwhelmingly, 315-59, to adopt an
amendment requiring suspension of federal student financial aid for
any student convicted of a drug offense.
   Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., also won support for an amendment to
allow states and the Education Department to pool resources for
special projects targeted at specific needs in a district. The
projects could be exempt from a wide range of federal and state
requirements.
   ``I think it is a major opening, major reform initiative to
encourage schools to reinvent themselves for sure-fire performance
for all students,'' said Smith, noting he had won endorsements from
the National Governors Association and the president's education
advisory council.
   The bill arose from the education summit Bush and the nation's
governors held in Charlottesville, Va., in September 1989. It
includes several of the statements of education policy goals
requested by Bush as well as broader Democratic plans for spending
programs.
   Bush's original version called for an estimated $400 million in
1991 spending. The House version increases authorization for
remedial assistance to disadvantaged children. It would authorize
$280 million for awards to exemplary schools, and includes money
for Bush's proposed National Science Scholars Program and programs
to fight illiteracy.
   It authorizes more money for financial assistance to college
students willing to enter the teaching profession and for
professional development of teachers.
   The Senate has passed a more limited version of the bill, and
differences will have to be resolved in a conference committee.

<HEAD>FCC Fines Indianapolis Station for Sexually Explicit Broadcasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indianapolis radio station has been fined
$10,000 for broadcasting sexually explicit material in violation of
federal indecency rules, the Federal Communications Commission says.
   The action announced Friday against WFBQ-FM, owned by Great
American Television and Radio Co. in Cincinnati, was the latest in
a spate of moves in the past year by a newly constituted FCC bent
on cracking down on disc jockeys often called ``shock jocks.''
   The FCC, led by new chairman Alfred Sikes, has issued a number
of warnings and fines against stations, most recently a $20,000
fine in June against a San Jose, Calif., radio station, KSJO-FM.
   In all cases, the commission cited ``indecent'' material
involving sexual innuendo or descriptions of sexual organs
broadcast between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.
   The commission earlier this month repeated its intention to try
to extend the ban on indecent broadcast material to 24 hours a day.
A court ruling on a 24-hour ban is pending.
   The FCC warned Great American officials a year ago that material
broadcast in 1987 on a show featuring disc jockeys Bob Kevoian and
Tom Griswold on WFBQ-FM and its sister station, WNDE-AM, may have
violated the FCC's indecency rules.
   Those rules prohibit the broadcast during daylight hours of
``language or material that ... depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards
for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or
organs.''
   The commission also reviewed material the station broadcast in
1989 and considered the company's arguments.
   In a letter to Great American officials dated Thursday, the FCC
agreed with the company's assertion that two skits in question were
not indecent.
   But the commission said that material in several other programs
``fit squarely within our definition of indecency.''
   Station manager Chris Wheat said the company had not decided
whether to appeal.
   The fines stem from a complaint filed by John R. Price, a
Carmel, Ind., lawyer who founded Decency in Broadcasting.

   Here is a brief profile of Liberian leader Samuel K. Doe:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Samuel K. Doe was born on May 6, 1950, in Tuzon, Grand Gedeh
County.
   He attended R.E.B. Richardson Baptist Junior High School and the
Ministry of National Defense Radio and Communication School in
Monrovia.
   Doe joined the Liberian Army in 1969. As a master sergeant, he
led the bloody coup on April 12, 1980, that ended the rule of
President William Tolbert, who was killed.
   Doe's presidency has been characterized by numerous coup
attempts, murders and detentions of opposition leaders and
suppression of the country's press.
   He permitted elections in October 1985. When opposition parties
appeared to have won the voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed
ballots. The election commission Doe had appointed declared him the
winner.
   The election rigging triggered the worst violence yet under
Doe's rule. At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died,
including Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led a coup attempt.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989,
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.

   Here is a brief profile of Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Charles Taylor, 42, received a bachelor's degree in economics
from Bentley College in Waltham, Mass.
   He returned to Liberia from the United States, where he worked
as a factory mechanic, after Samuel Doe took power in a 1980
military coup.
   Doe named Taylor head of the General Services Administration.
Taylor fled to the United States in 1983 to escape charges of
embezzlement.
   He was arrested in the United States but escaped before he could
be extradited.
   Taylor's revolt began Dec. 24, 1989, when he crossed the Ivory
Coast border into Liberia with a small band of men. They accused
Doe of corruption, mismanagement and human rights abuses. Taylor
based his men in Nimba County, an area hostile to Doe.
   Doe's foces responded with savage attacks on tribal groups that
supported Taylor. International agencies say hundreds were killed,
and the atrocities appeared to have increased support for Taylor.
   As a civilian, however, Taylor insists he is different from Doe,
who made his career in the military. He said he was leading ``a
grass-roots civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator'' but that
he harbored no dictatorial ambitions himself.

   Here are some facts and figures on Liberia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE LAND: The West African nation is bordered by Ivory Coast,
Guinea and Sierra Leone and covers 42,900 square miles _ about the
size of Ohio. The coastal plain gives way to rocky cliffs, and
strong tides make access to the Atlantic Ocean difficult. The
highest elevations are in the northern highlands, which rise up to
4,500 feet. The capital is Monrovia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE PEOPLE: The population is estimated at about 2.5 million,
including 16 principal tribal groups and about 50,000 descendants
of freed American slaves who founded the country. English is the
official language. The vast majority of the country practices
traditional African religions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY: Even before the rebel insurgency began, the economy
was near collapse, although Liberia possesses some of the richest
iron ore in the world. The country has been unable to pay its
foreign debt, and it has been suspended by the International
Monetary Fund. Mining has earned more than 64 percent of Liberia's
foreign exchange but agriculture has remained the main employer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE HISTORY: In 1822, freed American slaves visited Liberia and
began settlements. They declared Liberia an independent republic in
1847. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Americo-Liberians,
dominated the country until then-Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe led a
military coup on April 12, 1979. He was popular with the majority
of Liberians, who resented the dominance of the Americo-Liberians.
Doe headed a military government until October 1985, when elections
were held. He claimed victory, but opposition parties and
independent observers said the vote was rigged. On Dec. 24, 1989,
former Doe aide Charles Taylor invaded with a small band of men
from Ivory Coast. Taylor said he intended to topple Doe's
government.

<TEXT>
   A teen-age girl roughed up by a man
who pulled her from her bicycle and dragged her into woods is
fighting back with a self-defense book for her peers.
   At first, Amber Erling couldn't bear to stay home alone after
the 1989 attack, when she was 14.She enrolled in karate to help
regain her confidence and before long was holding self-defense
workshops with her karate instructor and mother.
   Prevention is the main lesson of the book, called ``Safe &amp;
Sound: A Parent's Guide on Self-Protection for Kids.''
   ``I figure if I can save one person, it will work,'' said Amber,
now 15 and a high school sophomore.
   Amber's mother, Susan Erling, said her 90-pound, 4-foot-11
daughter was wearing ballet practice clothes when a man in a car
pulled alongside her as she rode her bicycle on a Brooklyn Park
street near her home.
   The man grabbed Amber's moving bike and dragged her into the car
as she kicked, screamed and bit him. He drove to a nearby park and
dragged her out of the car and into the woods, where her screams
attracted residents. The attacker fled when a man came running to
her aid.
   ``Since we can't always take the bad guys off the streets, we
need to make their disgusting job of attacking kids much tougher,''
Amber said in a statement promoting the book.
   ``We need to teach kids how to be imperfect victims, the kind of
victims that child attackers hate.''
   In many cases, efforts to ward off an attacker are just what
experts advocate.
   Allen Garber, an FBI supervisory special agent in Minneapolis,
advises parents to instruct their children to create attention by
making noise if they're attacked.
   ``Child abductors don't want attention,'' Garber said.
   Mrs. Erling and Amber's karate teacher, E. Gordon Franks,
suggest in the book that children should jab or bite attackers if
they can't flee immediately, unless the attacker is armed.
   As law enforcement officials recommend, the book advocates
submission in the face of weapons.
   ``Although martial arts schools may teach a kid how to directly
defend against a particular weapon, we feel that it's wiser and
safer for a child not to directly resist at all,'' the book says.
   ``Instead, a child should resist in an indirect way by looking
for an opportunity to escape when the attacker is distracted or
slightly off-guard.''
   The book also warns against the danger of only a little
knowledge of self-defense for children.
   ``Unfortunately, there are drawbacks to giving children just a
brief education in self-defense, especially if the child somehow
gets an over-confident or invincible attitude as a result,'' the
book says.
   The mother, daughter and karate teacher had the book published
themselves. The first printing of 5,000 books has nearly sold out.
Mrs. Erling said they are planning a second run.
   Mrs. Erling and Franks spent about $7,500 each on the endeavor,
Mrs. Erling said. The book sells for $5.95. A videotape, book and
curriculum guide cost $100 and have been ordered by about 10
Minnesota school districts.

<HEAD>Marchers Protest Mohawk Bridge Blockade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHATEAUGUAY, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadians landlocked by Mohawk
Indians blockading a commuter bridge have staged an impromptu march
that ended in a brief but tense confrontation with police in riot
gear.
   About 2,000 people marched on foot for two miles Friday night
through town, said Chateauguay police constable Raymond Picard.
There were no injuries.
   Chateauguay is on the southwestern border of the Kahnawake
reserve, where Mohawks have blocked the Mercier bridge over the St.
Lawrence River to Montreal for more than a week.
   About 150 Indian chiefs from across the nation Friday called on
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to reconvene Parliament to deal with
the ``national crisis.''
   They also called on police to withdraw from barricades in Oka, a
town 18 miles west of Montreal, where authorities are locked in an
armed standoff with Mohawks who claim land there as ancestral
territory.
   The Indians are trying to block a plan by municipal officials to
build a golf course addition on the disputed land. A shootout
between Indians and Canadian police at Oka on July 11 left one
police officer dead, though it was not clear whether the officer
died from police or Mohawk gunfire.
   Mohawks in Chateauguay blockaded the Mercier bridge in support
of the Indians in Oka.
   The protest started at 9:30 p.m. with 300 marchers at the border
of Chateauguay and the Mohawk reserve, where police have manned
barricades to keep people away from the Indian blockade 100 yards
down the road.
   Others joined the march as it wound through town and returned to
the barricades. Protesters toppled a 100-yard length of metal
barricades set up by police.
   About 150 officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and
the town and provincial police forces, formed a line to keep
marchers off the reservation. The police wore riot helmets and
carried billy clubs.
   Chateauguay residents are angry over the bridge blockade, which
forces a detour of up to two hours for workers who commute to
Montreal.
   ``Close the Mercier, open the 30 highway!'' the marchers chanted
in French.
   They referred to plans for a new commuter highway, Route 30,
which would bypass the reservation.
   Marchers complained that provincial and local leaders have
failed to act on the proposed highway. If that road were built,
future clashes with Mohawks would not disrupt traffic, protesters
said.
   The marchers were escorted by half a dozen police cars, and
traffic was blocked as the marchers filled several main roads.
About 100 cars joined the procession.
   One woman rushed from her house in bare feet and a white bath
robe to join the march.
   The protesters went to Chateauguay Mayor Jean-Bosco Bourcier's
home to complain about local leaders' inaction over the
transportation problem. Bourcier was not home.
   Most of the protesters had dispersed by 1 a.m., officials said.
   Earlier this week, crowds tried to push their way through police
barricades, burned effigies of Mohawks and taunted the Indians with
war whoops.

<HEAD>Jury Returns Sealed Verdict in McMartin Child Molestation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury deliberating the fate of the only
remaining defendant in the 7-year-old McMartin Pre-School
molestation case has returned its first sealed verdict and resumed
consideration of seven other charges.
   ``It's almost like waiting to wonder if you're going to get the
electric chair or if they're going to let you go,'' Raymond Buckey
told reporters Friday after the first verdict was delivered.
   Jurors in Buckey's second trial heard nearly three months of
testimony and have been discussing the case for two weeks.
   The jury appeared to be following the same procedure used by the
jury in Buckey's first trial, which ended earlier this year. That
jury submitted separate verdicts in sealed envelopes, but none was
announced until all of the verdicts were reached.
   A clerk in the court of Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg
said the first verdict was sealed and would remain that way for the
time being. Jurors were told to continue their talks.
   Buckey, 32, is charged with molesting three young girls at his
family's now-defunct Manhattan Beach nursery school in the early
1980s. He and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were acquitted
of 52 molestation charges on Jan. 18 after a trial lasting nearly
three years.
   The jury in that trial deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey
alone, and District Attorney Ira Reiner decided to retry him on
eight of those charges.
   In the second trial, the prosecution relied heavily on the
testimony of the three girls, now in adolescence, who had trouble
remembering events alleged to have occurred when they were
toddlers. However, they said Buckey molested them.
   Buckey took the witness stand and swore he never molested any
children.
   The case is the nation's longest criminal court proceeding.

   Move over Alfred, Mr. French and Lurch. Take a
hike Jeeves. A new breed of butler is standing at the door, ready
to take the sting out of daily life.
   But, please. Sweep the word butler under the rug. Now it's
``household manager,'' thank you very much.
   From a Victorian mansion where there's nary a speck of dust, the
Starkey Institute for Household Management began cranking out the
next generation of helpers in January. They're a far cry from the
crusty, pursed-lipped Englishman good at answering the front door
and serving tea.
   Mary Starkey, the institute's president and founder, says her
graduates are trained to perform myriad tasks in today's
complicated world, from balancing the family checkbook to knowing
when the water heater needs maintenance.
   ``This business is not about cleaning someone's home. It's about
helping to run their daily lives,'' she says.
   The institute was conceived on the basis of studies that
American households, especially those with two incomes, require
specialized management, Starkey says.
   Her students, about 50 so far, agree. And they don't have much
in common with stereotypical butlers popularized by television's
Mr. French of ``Family Affair,'' Lurch of ``The Addams Family,''
Alfred of ``Batman,'' or Jeeves from the Bertie Wooster books by
P.G. Wodehouse.
   Ginny Spencer was a successful real estate agent who dabbled in
catering. She heard about the institute from Sandy Wischmeyer, a
caterer and the school's director of curriculum.
   Spencer liked the idea so much that at 53, she decided to change
careers.
   ``The program is just wonderful,'' Spencer says. ``There's a
definite need for this kind of industry. I feel lucky to be in on
the ground floor.''
   The institute is housed in a 10,000-square-foot Victorian
mansion that is impeccably decorated with antiques. The mansion
gives the students hands-on experience, Starkey says.
   Starkey acknowledges the household manager idea is not widely
popular in the United States, but she says it's catching on.
   Tuition for the eight-week program is $4,000, which covers 300
hours of education. The price may seem a bit steep to some, but
Starkey has a decisive defense.
   ``Where else would you train household managers but in their
workplace? And where else can you go to school for two months and
come out qualified for a job that pays $18,000 a year? It's a
perfect setup,'' Starkey says.
   Students cover seven general areas during the eight-week program
_ organization, cleaning and maintenance of the household; fine
dining; entertaining; clothing and travel; art; security and
finance; and, perhaps most important of all, finding themselves
jobs.
   ``We want them to leave with a repertoire of management,
organization skills, recipes _ overall knowledge of anything and
everything that can happen in a household,'' Starkey says.
   Graduates with no prior experience in a service-oriented
profession can expect to earn between $18,000 and $30,000 a year
plus living expenses, Starkey says. If a student has experience,
say in a hotel or restaurant, $24,000 to $40,000 is a reasonable
salary.
   Starkey runs her own placement agency, which she began nine
years ago. She started the agency mainly to place nannies and baby
sitters.
   Starkey receives 30 to 40 telephone calls a week from people
needing one of her students and 150 calls a week from prospective
students.
   She's currently trying to assemble a staff of 20 to help a
wealthy entrepreneur run his island estate.
   ``We may have to hurry this current class along a little,''
Starkey joked.

<HEAD>Ship That Caused Nation's Worst Oil Spill Afloat Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former Exxon Valdez is afloat again after a
$30 million repair job to its hull, which was mangled when the
tanker struck a reef and caused the nation's worst oil spill.
   The vessel, renamed the Exxon Mediterranean, was maneuvered
Friday night from the dry dock where it spent 11 months being
rebuilt to a shipyard pier a quarter-mile away in San Diego Bay.
Its engines, pumps and other machinery will be tested before two
weeks of sea trials.
   ``They'll make sure everything runs and there's no leaks in any
of the systems. It's basic operating _ like idling a car,''
shipyard spokesman Fred Hallett said.
   ``At sea, they'll go full speed ... putting her through her
maximum paces and making sure not only that she works, but that she
works to the (specifications) she's supposed to.''
   Repairs on the ship began last August after it was towed 2,500
miles from Alaska to the dry dock where it was built and launched
in 1986. Workers replaced the single-hulled ship's mangled steel
with 3,000 tons of new, inch-thick steel.
   The 24-hour process of flooding the dry dock and ballasting the
ship began late Thursday.
   Robert Weatherford, a business and planning manager for Exxon
Shipping Co., said at a news conference aboard the tanker that
``the refloating is a big milestone in returning this vessel to
service.''
   The 987-foot-long ship, the largest tanker in Exxon's 13-ship
fleet, will be thoroughly tested 100 to 150 miles offshore, away
from ``shipping traffic lanes that run up and down the California
coast,'' said its captain, Mike Stalzer.
   The testing also will determine whether the vessel obtains
certification as a seaworthy vessel, said Coast Guard inspector Lt.
Bill Uberti, who will be aboard the ship during the trial run.
   Exxon denies that the renaming of the ship and its relocation to
Middle East oil routes were related to last year's spill. Fully
loaded, the vessel is too big for any U.S. Pacific ports and
declining oil production in Alaska has reduced the need for such
large tankers on the West Coast.
   The ship spilled almost 11 million gallons of oil after it
struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989,
fouling hundreds of miles of coastline and killing untold numbers
wildlife.
   After the seaworthiness tests are finished next month, the ship
and its 20-member crew are to return to San Diego for supplies
before heading for its new base of operations, Stalzer said.
   The tanker, which holds nearly 1.4 million barrels of crude,
will stop in Singapore en route to ports in Egypt and Turkey where
it will be loaded.
   The tanker will continue to carry U.S. registry and an American
crew.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dinner-fashion show given by Roman prince-designer
Giovanni Torlonia, the famed Spanish Steps as a runway and a gala
hosted by Princess Marina Doria of Savoia combined to ennoble the
sagging image of Italian couture.
   With all the partying and aristocratic elbow-rubbing it was more
of a high society than high fashion week, with almost as many
elegant clothes seen off the runway as on. The weeklong showings
for next fall and winter ended Friday.
   Talk of the town was the descent on Rome by Marina Doria, wife
of Victor Emmanuel IV, son of the last king of Italy. The royal
family was exiled from Italy when the country became a republic in
1946, and the male heirs banned from returning even for a visit.
   However, judging from the scramble for invitations to the
blue-blooded event in honor of Italian designers, monarchic
nostalgia still lingers in the Italian capital.
   Despite the show of strength on the Spanish Steps and the top
drawer guest lists, Italian couture is having problems. Whereas
Milan, home of Italy's ready-to-wear, has given Paris a run for its
money, Italian couture with headquarters in Rome, has maintained
its clients at home, but lost a good chunk of the international
market to Paris in the past several years.
   The greatest blow to its image was the desertion at the
beginning of the year by Valentino, who now shows both his
ready-to-wear and high fashion collections in Paris. Several years
ago Milanese designer Gianfranco Ferre brought new blood to Rome by
showing his couture collection in the city, but he too has
abandoned Rome for Paris where he designs couture for Dior.
   Another of this week's most sought-after events was the
presentation of his evening wear collection by Prince Giovanni
Torlonia. It was the first couture collection of the young
designer, sole heir to the vast Torlonia fortune, and also first
member of the age-old dynasty to go to work.
   To best set off his sumptuous gowns, Torlonia chose young ladies
of Roman aristocracy as models, who looked like they stepped out of
gilt-framed ancestral paintings as they walked through the halls of
the family's Renaissance palace in downtown Rome.
   A stone's throw from the Torlonia homestead are the Spanish
Steps which for the past five years have served as backdrop for the
grand finale of the Rome fashion week, with couture and
ready-to-wear designers alike parading their wares for next year's
winter fashion.
   Thursday night 18 of Italy's top designers, including Armani,
Valentino, Versace, Fendi and Ferre showed the best of their
evening wear on the moonlit steps. For the mega production which
was televised around the world each designer chose a celebrity to
accompany the collection.
   Thus actress Johanna Pakula made her way down the steps in a
gray chiffon sequined gown for Armani, while Anthony Quinn lent a
supporting arm to a red cashmere clad model for Laura Biagiotti.
   Anthony Delon, son of French actor Alain Delon, was all too
happy to escort his lady down the stairs, as she flashed her legs
in a super-mini brown silk sequined dress by Pino Lancetti.
   Valentino preferred to let his lady stand alone, sending a
stunning Ornella Muti in a 1965 red chiffon Valentino floor-length
gown down the spectacular runway.
   Hollywood favorite Gianni Versace stole the show when he sent
top model Jennifer Flavin in an ultra-tight sequined jump suit
slowly down the steps and into the arms of current boyfriend
Sylvester Stallone.
   In general the high fashion look for next year's chillier
weather is either super short and sexy or long flouncy and elegant.
Sequins and elaborate detailing abound. Heels are very high _ the
models who tottered down the Spanish Steps could tell a tale _ and
jewelry is discreet playing heavily on the earring.
   Makeup is demure. Boyish haircuts are out, long loose and softly
curled is in. Aside from the traditional black evening gown,
brightend by spangles (the best were seen at Mila Schoen) favorite
colors are electric shades of red, blue, green and purple.

nation's top prosecutor says.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said 78 percent of the people
convicted of large-scale fraud during the last two years landed in
prison, and they received prison terms ranging from 30 days to 30
years.
   ``In the white-collar cases, it's the imposition of the jail
time, often more than the length of the jail time, that's
important,'' Thornburgh said Friday.
   White-collar criminals are less accustomed to hearing a jail
door slam behind them than drug traffickers or violent criminals,
Thornburgh told a law enforcement group that coordinates financial
institution fraud investigations in the area.
   A study completed by Thornburgh's office this week found that
329 people have been indicted and 213 convicted.
   ``We are seeking jail time in every case a major fraud has
occurred,'' Thornburgh said. ``We're going to be busy in this area
for the foreseeable future.''
   The savings and loan crisis should remain a high priority for at
least the next five years because 530 thrifts remain under
investigation, he said.
   Thornburgh reiterated that there is no need for a special
prosecutor to investigate President Bush's son, Neil, a former
director of the failed Silverado Savings &amp; Loan in Denver.
   ``I'm not aware of evidence of any allegations from a credible
source that Mr. Bush has committed any criminal wrongdoing,'' he
said.
   Earlier Friday, Thornburgh criticized a major civil rights bill
passed this week by the U.S. Senate. The measure, which is intended
to protect women and minorities from job discrimination, is opposed
by the president.
   ``The bill cannot be one that promotes the notion of quotas,''
Thornburgh said at an 8th Circuit judicial conference. ``Workers
should not have to anticipate that employment decisions will be
made by numbers.''

<HEAD>Driver Arrested in Crash of Bus Carrying American Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The driver of a bus that overturned,
killing two American teen-agers studying at Oxford University, has
been arrested on reckless driving charges, police said.
   All of the 59 others on board, most of them also American
students, were injured in the accident Thursday.
   John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford reported Friday that 16 people
were still hospitalized. One was in intensive care.
   The driver of the double-decker bus, Gan Sharma, 40, was taken
into custody Thursday night and charged with causing death by
reckless driving, police said. They said alcohol was not a factor
in the accident.
   Sharma was slightly injured. He was released on bail Friday
pending further investigation, said Chief Inspector Laurie Fray of
the Thames Valley police.
   The bus was carrying gifted U.S. students who were taking a
four-week summer school course at Oxford University's Magdalen
College. The vehicle toppled as it turned off a highway near
Wheatley, six miles east of Oxford, police said.
   They identified the dead as students Lawrence Levine, 16, of
Chappaqua, N.Y., and Autumn Dubose, 18, of Lilburn, Ga.
   Fray said police will question Marilyn Whiteman, who said
Thursday the bus had passed her traveling 80 to 85 mph just before
the crash. The British highway speed limit is 70 mph.
   She said it suddenly turned left at the Wheatley turnoff without
signaling and went out of control.
   At Radcliffe Hospital, U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto spoke to the
injured and to parents who flew in from the United States.
   Brad Becker, 16, of Piedmont, Calif., told the ambassador there
was panic on the bus when it went out of control.
   ``I said, `Oh my God!' and people started screaming. The bus
just made it onto the grass and fell over. If it had fallen into
the freeway, we'd all have plummeted into the path of cars. We'd
have been killed _ all of us,'' he said.
   Becker suffered a broken vertebra.
   Diedre Walsh, a spokeswoman for the Oxford Advanced Studies
Program in New York, said talks were under way at Magdalen College
to decide whether the course should continue. The Advanced Studies
Program in New York organized the trip.

<HEAD>United Auto Workers Union Plans to Stick to Past Bargaining
Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers will not
give Chrysler Corp. a contract that varies from pacts reached with
others in the Big Three, the union's president says.
   The union's president, Owen Bieber, made the promise Friday,
shortly after talks opened with Chrysler. Negotiations began
Wednesday with General Motors Corp. and Thursday with Ford Motor Co.
   The union will not divert from its past strategy of ``pattern
bargaining'' with all three companies until sometime around Labor
Day, then selecting a strike target. Talks at the other two
companies would be suspended.
   A contract reached at the target then would be taken to the
other two companies.
   Published reports have speculated that Chrysler may break the
pattern because of its financial problems.
   ``Abandoning the pattern concept will not solve problems,''
Bieber said. ``It will create even more. Chrysler would gain
nothing, but lose a great deal of morale.''
   Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker behind GM and Ford, faces
the toughest financial tests at the start of talks. Contracts
expire Sept. 14.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, the company's lead
negotiator, was the only one among company and union officials to
talk about proposals.
   Among three proposals St. John mentioned Friday was one that
would establish a multi-employer health-care trust.
   Such a proposal has drawn cool receptions at GM and Ford. The
UAW had no reaction Friday.
   ``We are not constrained from establishing, with union
agreement, a multi-employer trust with (companies) other than Ford
and GM ... although I would hope that they would have an interest
as well,'' St. John said. ``It could be a supplier or series of
suppliers.''
   Negotiators from each of the Big Three have said containing
health-care costs is a high priority in the talks. In 1989, GM said
it spent about $3 billion in health-care costs, Ford spent about
$813 million and Chrysler shelled out $684 million.
   St. John said under a multi-employer program, the size of the
group covered by the plan could be huge, which would drive down
costs. Also, he said, the companies could avoid increased costs
anticipated in 1993 when new Financial Accounting Standards Board
regulations could take effect.
   Chrysler says it currently funds health-care and pension costs
on a pay-as-you-go basis. The new regulations would require
companies to set aside money for anticipated costs, which Chrysler
figures to be about $7 per hour per employee. That works out to
just less than $200 million annually.
   Chrysler is expected to report by the end of the month that its
second-quarter earnings were about half of the $341 million it made
during the period last year.

<TEXT>
   In a case with echoes of the Howard Beach
racial attack, a black man walking with his white girlfriend was
critically injured when a white man chased him into the path of an
oncoming truck.
   Herbert Jennings, 38, of Baltimore, was in a coma today with a
severe head injury at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma
Center after Thursday night's attack, the hospital said.
   Daniel Porter, 21, of Baltimore, was charged with assault and
reckless endangerment for chasing Jennings on a street near the
girlfriend's home. Porter was released Friday on $25,000 bail.
   Jennings' 32-year-old girlfriend, whom police would not
identify, and several other people were questioned, and others may
be charged, police said.
   The attack occurred in the mostly white, working-class
neighborhood of Highlandtown, a southeast Baltimore enclave ringed
by predominantly black, working-class districts, police spokesman
Dennis Hill said.
   The incident bore similarities to a 1986 attack by a group of
whites on three black men in the Howard Beach section of Queens in
New York City. One of the blacks was struck by a car and killed as
he fled across a highway. Three of the whites were convicted of
manslaughter, assault and conspiracy.
   In Baltimore, two white men in a pickup truck taunted Jennings
and his girlfriend as they walked along the street, police said.
   Porter and two other white men approached the couple moments
later, police said. Porter yelled to the men in the truck, asking
if they wanted him to attack Jennings, whom he called by a racial
epithet, police said.
   A man in the truck yelled, ``Yes,'' and Jennings ran, with
Porter in pursuit. Jennings slipped and fell after running a short
distance and was accidentally struck by another pickup truck, Hill
said. The driver of that truck was not charged.
   The girlfriend was not injured. The first truck, whose occupants
started the incident, sped away, Hill said. He said police don't
believe the whites knew Jennings or his girlfriend.
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke said race relations have improved since the
riots of the 1960s in Baltimore, whose population is roughly 60
percent black.
   ``I can point to more harmony among races in Baltimore now than
I could let's say 20 or 30 years ago,'' said Schmoke, the city's
first black mayor.
   Police said Highlandtown has no history of racial confrontation.
   In a separate incident several miles away early Wednesday, a
black man was stabbed to death when he and a friend were attacked
by a group of white men. Police had no clear evidence that the
incident was racially motivated, Hill said, but he added, ``We are
treating it as if it were.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: City Opera to Keep Nude Characters in Fall Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general director of the New York City Opera
says three naked virgins will remain in a fall production, despite
internal fears that a federal grant could be jeopardized, a
newspaper reported today.
   The company will not change its plans for ``Moses und Aron,''
the official, Christopher Keene, was quoted as saying in The New
York Times.
   Questions about the virgins surfaced in an internal memorandum
from Marc A. Dorfman, who handles foundation and government gifts
to the opera company.
   He wondered in the memo whether the virgins' presence could
violate new obscenity guidelines issued last week by the National
Endowment for the Arts, which gave the opera company a special
grant for the production.
   NEA spokesman Virginia Falck said it was unlikely the virgins
will lead to problems.
   The guidelines, based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent, say an
obscene work is one which the average person would find ``appeals
to the prurient interests,'' which ``depicts or describes sexual
conduct in a patently offensive way,'' and which ``lacks serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
   Keene said Friday that ``Moses und Aron'' doesn't qualify.
   ``We do not think that `Moses und Aron' or any other production
we are doing is obscene in term's of the Supreme Court's
definition.''
   ``Moses und Aron'' is set to debut Sept. 22. The unfinished
opera by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg is considered one of
the 20th century's masterpieces.

<HEAD>Case Of Art Imitating Life: Rock Concert With Styrofoam Berlin
Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge styrofoam wall at the site of the
shattered Berlin Wall is the setting for a concert by ex-Pink Floyd
guitarist Roger Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Sinead
O'Connor and others.
   About 180,000 fans were expected at tonight's outdoor spectacle
that is raising money for victims of disasters, and whose
centerpiece is a performance of Pink Floyd's 11-year-old rock epic,
``The Wall.''
   Waters, who composed ``The Wall'' but has since left the group
for a solo career, is headlining the extravaganza.
   The celebrated record, which was made into a movie in 1982, is
about alienation and the manipulation of the minds of individuals
by governments, but not specifically about the Berlin Wall.
   A giant 600-foot-long and 60-foot-high structure made of 2,500
styrofoam bricks will come crashing down at the concert's climax.
   The concert also will feature a six-story inflatable pig and an
equally large teacher, two characters in Pink Floyd's atmospheric,
other-worldly music.
   Workers for weeks have been building the gigantic stage on 35
acres of Potsdamer Platz, the historic square of old Berlin that
was converted into a desolate no-man's land by the building of the
Berlin Wall.
   All of the Berlin Wall at Potsdamer Platz has been torn down in
the last few months in anticipation of the unification of the
German states in December.
   The stretch of land between the two sections of wall, where East
Germans were once shot and killed while fleeing to the West, was
expected to hold about 180,000 concertgoers for tonight's show.
   More than 160,000 tickets have been sold at $30 each and 20,000
additional tickets were to go on sale today, said spokeswoman Emma
Jenks.
   ``The stage crew alone is literally hundreds and hundreds of
people,'' she said Friday.
   Others slated to perform tonight included Cindy Lauper, James
Galway, Thomas Dolby, Albert Finney, model Jerry Hall, the
Chieftains, the Scorpions, the Hooters and the East Berlin Rundfunk
Symphony Orchestra and Radio Choir.
   The concert cost $8 million to stage and profits from the show,
as well as a planned album and video, are to go to the Memorial
Fund for Disaster Relief, Jenks said.
   The London-based fund was set up last year to create a permanent
reservoir of cash for disaster relief.
   The European Community on Friday said it would donate $378,000
to the concert.
   Jenks said organizers would not know until after the concert how
much of the proceeds, expected to approach $10 million, would go to
the disaster relief fund after expenses.

<HEAD>Report: Cosmonauts Nearly Ran Out of Oxygen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts nearly ran out of oxygen when a
sticky hatch prevented them from re-entering their space station,
but they will take another space walk next week to repair the door,
according to a newspaper report.
   The trouble occurred Tuesday while the cosmonauts were outside
their space station making repairs, said the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda.
   Pravda, in its Friday editions, quoted Yuri Isaulov, a ground
controller at the Soviet Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad, as
saying cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin will make
another space walk Thursday ``to put things in order.''
   The sticky hatch was the latest in a series of problems the
cosmonauts have faced during their six-month mission.
   Solovyev and Balandin went outside the Mir space station to fix
thermal insulation that was damaged during the launch of the Soyuz
TM-9 capsule they must use to return to Earth.
   The strenuous space walk took two hours longer than planned, and
the cosmonauts could not re-enter the spacecraft because of the
sticky hatch, Soviet media reported.
   Their oxygen was running dangerously low and they were forced to
use an emergency porthole on another part of the space station
complex to get back inside, seven hours after their exit.
   Once inside, the cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to
seal one end of the airlock compartment that leads to the
troublesome outside hatch.
   Isaulov told Pravda that the outside hatch is ``slightly ajar,''
leaving the airlock compartment unsealed.
   ``This is not a normal situation and we would not like it to
continue,'' he said. ``So, we have informed the crew that they
would have to make another space walk on July 26 to put things in
order.''
   In their rush to get back into the space station, the cosmonauts
also left behind some ladders on a work platform where they were
fixing the insulation on the outside of the Soyuz capsule. Ground
controllers were studying videotapes of the exterior of the space
complex to see if that would cause a problem, Pravda said.
   The ladders and work platform attached to the Soyuz might hinder
the capsule when it separates from the Mir complex, said James
Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet space program, in an
interview from his Texas home.
   The thermal insulation protects the capsule while in space and
is separate from the shield that deflects heat during re-entry.
   The cosmonauts have been in space since Feb. 11. The ground
controllers plan to bring them home in the Soyuz capsule on Aug. 9.
They originally were scheduled to return July 30.
   A replacement crew is to be launched Aug. 1.

   A new T-shirt emblazoned with the words ``Black
Sunday'' is the latest source of friction between Palestinian
youths and Israeli soldiers.
   The shirt is meant as a silent protest over the massacre of
seven Arab laborers by an Israeli gunman on Sunday, May 20. The
design includes drawings of seven bullet holes across the chest.
   Israel says the gunman was deranged. Israeli, Ami Popper, 21, is
on trial for the slayings.
   Soldiers and border police have confiscated T-shirts from stores
and in one case ordered two youths in the West Bank city of
Bethlehem to take off the shirts and hand them over, Palestinian
reporters say.
   A Palestinian youth was jailed after soldiers found him carrying
a bag containing 40 ``Black Sunday'' shirts. He was released the
next morning, but without the shirts.

<BYLINE>Leads with 4 grafs to move up Salvadoran reference. Pickup 5th

<TEXT>
   A new round of Salvadoran peace
talks between the U.S.-backed government and leftist rebels got off
to a slow start, and they were overshadowed by reports of heavy
fighting in El Salvador.
   U.N. mediator Alvaro de Soto said negotiators only scratched the
surface of their agenda when the five days of talks opened Friday.
   ``They got into specific themes, but without going very deep
into the negotiations process,'' he told a news conference.
   The Salvadoran army reported that six rebels were killed and
seven wounded Thursday in heavy fighting with soldiers near
Jucuapa, 68 miles east of the capital San Salvador. It said another
rebel was wounded in fighting near Lolotique, 75 miles east of the
capital.
   The talks are the third round of negotiations this year aimed at
reaching a cease-fire in the 10-year-old Salvadoran civil war,
which has claimed and estimated 72,000 lives.
   The rebels have promised to stage an all-out offensive if the
negotiations fail to meet their expectations.
   The armed forces said in a statement that military patrols
seized about 20 rebel anti-personnel mines Thursday in a raid at
Tecoluca, 45 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   Guerrillas dynamited five power line towers, briefly blacking
out eastern regions of the nation, the statement said.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
deplored the threat of a renewed offensive.
   He accused the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
of carrying out ``brutal assassinations'' directed at Salvadoran
military personnel and their families.
   ``The purpose ... seems to be to polarize the situation further
and to elicit a reaction from extremists on the right,'' he said,
citing the recent killings of an off-duty officer and of an army
major on his way to law school.
   The United States has been providing President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government with more than $1 million a day in
military and economic aid to keep the government and country
running. Many U.S. lawmakers have accused the government of human
rights violations and say the aid should be reduced or eliminated.
   Boucher said the left ``should put aside its tactics of
assassination and violence and go to the table committed to a just
peace.''
   The left is demanding reform of the military and elimination of
rightist death squads connected to the army as a prerequisite to a
negotiated cease-fire.
   ``We demand that army members guilty of political crimes be
purged,'' rebel negotiator Shafik Handal said.
   The army has maintained it will clean its house with no help
from the rebels.
   The last round of talks in Mexico in June produced no accords
after discussions got hung up on the subject.
   But army Col. Mauricio Vargas, head of the 3rd Infantry Brigade,
expressed hopes that this round of talks will produce results.
   ``If there is the political will on both sides, we expect to
reach accords. Even if they're not spectacular this will bring us
closer to peace,'' Vargas said.
   Handal said the rebels plan to press for a reduction in El
Salvador's 54,000-man military force and demand that the military
be purged of officers who have violated human rights.
   The rebels also seek the dismantling of rightist death squads
and elimination of compulsory military service, Handal said.
   Rights groups estimate more than 72,000 people have been killed
since the war began in October 1979, most of them civilians slain
by death squads.
   De Soto, a personal representative of U.N. secretary-general
Javier Perez de Cuellar, is mediating this round of talks.

   Nine more Cubans sought refuge in the Spanish
Embassy in Havana before dawn today, bringing to 18 the number of
asylum-seekers in the mission, the Spanish news agency EFE reported.
   The development comes a day after five Cubans entered the
embassy. Four Cubans have taken refuge at the residence of the
Italian ambassador, and other similar cases this month have caused
friction between diplomats and the Communist government of Fidel
Castro.
   Four Cubans today entered the Spanish Embassy grounds at about 1
a.m. ( 2 a.m. EDT), and five more gained access at about 3 a.m.,
EFE said in a dispatch from Havana.
   Officials at the Spanish Foreign Ministry in Madrid could not
confirm the EFE report.
   The first group today crossed a neighboring property and entered
the embassy by way of a terrace, while the second group scaled the
embassy facade and broke a balcony while trying to enter the
building, EFE said.
   All nine asylum-seekers were men who appeared to be between the
ages of 25 and 40, EFE said.
   The new arrivals came two days after Spain suspended its entire
$2.5 million 1990 aid package to Cuba Thursday to express its
displeasure over Cuba's unusually harsh criticism of Spanish
Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez.
   On Wednesday the Cuban Foreign Ministry blasted Ordonez in a
three-page official statement, calling him a ``frustrated colonial
administrator'' and a victim of ``historical amnesia.'' It
threatened to send all the island's undesirable inhabitants to the
12-nation European Economic Community.
   Fernandez Ordonez had previously suggested that Castro would be
cautious about allowing Cubans to leave because he new their
departure would cause his regime to crumble.
   The first of the 18 refugees holed up in the Spanish embassy
arrived July 11.
   Spain has said it would not turn over the Cubans in its embassy
to Cuban authorites and would try to negotiate their departure
outside Cuba.
   Five Cubans who spent a week in a Czechoslovak diplomat's
apartment gave up their bid for asylum Thursday after receiving
assurances they would not be prosecuted, according to reports from
Havana.
   Diplomats accused Cuban police of violating diplomatic territory
to make arrests, and a bitter dispute developed between Spain and
its former colony after Cuban police seized one refugee on Spanish
Embassy grounds.
   In Washington, Michael Kozak, a deputy assistant secretary of
state, called in a Cuban diplomat on Friday to protest the
Communist nation's claims that the United States encouraged Cubans
to seek asylum in embassies. The State Department has called such
allegations ``outrageous.''
   The official Mexican news agency Notimex said U.S. and West
German officials in Havana have denied Cuban allegations their
countries were involved in a plot. The U.S. statement said Cuban
agents tried several times to compromise U.S. officials in past
months.
   The Cuban refugee problem has attracted widespread attention
because it is reminiscent of the East German refugees who sought
passage to the West at embassies in Eastern Europe last year. Their
exodus helped precipitate the fall of East Germany's rigid
Communist government.
   Albania, which like Cuba has refused to follow the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe in adopting democratic reforms, last week
allowed hundreds of people who had entered embassies in its capital
to leave for new lives in the West.
   In April 1980, thousands of disaffected Cubans jammed the
Peruvian Embassy in Havana. Shortly thereafter, many joined what
became the Mariel boat lift, which eventually took 125,000 Cubans
to Florida.

<HEAD>Nobel Peace Prize Committee Chairman Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel Peace Prize committee chairman Egil
Aarvik, who used the Nobel Peace Prize to encourage human rights,
has died. He was 77.
   Aarvik died Thursday at Norway's national hospital in Oslo. The
cause of death was not disclosed.
   A retired journalist and Christian People's Party politician,
Aarvik was appointed by Parliament to the Norwegian Nobel Committee
in 1974 and became its chairman in 1982.
   Under his influence, the committee began to use the peace prize
to encourage pro-democracy efforts and human rights. Some awards
angered governments.
   Most recently, China criticized Aarvik when the Nobel Committee
awarded the 1989 peace prize to the Dali Lama, Tibet's exiled
leader.
   South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel laureate, told
newspapers today that the prize to Poland's Lech Welesa in 1983
``and the recognition of the church's battle against apartheid were
brave decisions that Aarvik has a great deal of the credit for.''
   Aarvik was born on Dec. 12, 1912, in the central Norway town of
Borsa. The son of laborer Juiius and Louise Aarvik wanted to be an
auto mechanic as a youth, but went to work as a farmhand.
   His higher education was limited to a year at college and three
months at Bible school.
   His journalism career began in 1946 with the Christian newspaper
Dagsavisa, in Trondheim near his hometown. He also published a
number of books.
   Aarvik was elected to Parliament in 1961 and served until 1977.
He was minister of social affairs from 1965 to 1971 in a
non-socialist coalition government.
   Aarvik is survived by his wife, Anna Cathrine, three sons, a
daughter and 11 grandchildren.
   News reports said Norwegian writer Gidske Anderson is expected
to succeed Aarvik. She would be the second woman to head the Nobel
committee.

   Madrid's suspension of aid to Cuba
underscores pressure for democratic change in the former Spanish
colony and further isolates Fidel Castro at a time when his main
benefactor, Moscow, is getting stingier.
   ``It's an abrupt and historic decision,'' said political
scientist Manuel Alcantara, a professor of Latin American affairs
at Madrid's Complutense University. ``Because of the events in
Eastern Europe, Spain feels some kind of responsibility about Cuba,
to work for change there.''
   As of today, 18 Cubans were in the Spanish mission in Havana,
the Spanish news agency EFE reported. Nine sought refuge today, it
said, and on Friday five entered the embassy. The four others
sought refuge last week.
   Spain says it will not expel the asylum-seekers and will try to
negotiate their departure from Cuba.
   Cuba calls all those who have sought refuge in the Spanish,
Czech and Italian missions ``scum'' and habitual vagrants.
   Spain's secretary of state for international cooperation, Luis
Yanez, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that Spain was
suspending $2.5 million in direct grants-in-aid to Cuba, the
country's total this year to the island that was a Spanish colony
for 406 years until 1898.
   While the sum is not substantial, another Spanish Foreign
Ministry official hinted Friday that the move probably would not be
the last to try to pressure the government of President Fidel
Castro to grant more freedom to Cubans.
   ``More measures will be necessary,'' said Yago Pico de Coana,
director general for Latin American affairs. He said it would be
imprudent to elaborate.
   Spain has also recalled its ambassador in Havana for
consultations.
   Cuba already has had to cope with a trade embargo by the United
States and a loss of support from the Soviet Union and from East
European countries that shed their Communist governments since last
year.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms Castro has
criticized, is not as forthcoming on aid as in the past. Castro
repeatedly has rejected Western-style balloting and said his
country has no need for Soviet-style reform _ despite pressure from
Gorbachev.
   As criticism of Cuba has appeared in official Soviet media,
Castro has called on Cubans to brace for possible cuts in the
Soviets' $5 billion in yearly aid.
   U.S. sources last year said there had been substantial
reductions already, as evidenced in the marked decline in the
purchase of sugar, which the Soviet Union buys from Cuba at prices
substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy.
   Castro also has lost his two closest Caribbean allies _ Panama's
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was toppled in a U.S. invasion in
December, and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, who were defeated by
a U.S.-backed opposition coalition in elections Feb. 25.
   Yanez said the Spanish aid cutoff effectively severed Cuba's
``umbilical cord'' with Spain that afforded access to the European
Community. He said resumption of the aid was contingent on ``the
resolution of problems through political channels.''
   Cuba has been attempting to reach some kind of aid agreement
with the 12-nation West European trading bloc but without success.
   A Spanish government spokesman, who is customarily not
identified, denied that the decision to suspend aid represented a
major shift in policy toward Cuba. He said the action was in
keeping with remarks Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez made to Castro
in March about the need for the Marxist nation to move toward
democracy.
   Spain has maintained cordial ties throughout its own
authoritarian and democratic administrations with the former colony.
   Both Gen. Francisco Franco and the democratically elected
administrations that have governed Spain since his death in 1975
have assured Castro easy credit to purchase Spanish goods and
finance long-term projects.
   Cuba's total commercial debt with Madrid is estimated at about
$900 million, making Spain Cuba's second-most important creditor
after the Soviet Union, to which Cuba owes an estimated $3 billion.
   The conservative Madrid daily ABC, an outspoken opponent of both
the Castro and Gonzalez governments, pointed out that Yanez's
annoucement didn't affect Spain's soft-loan program to Cuba, for
which $11 million are earmarked this year _ nor its commercial
credit and guarantee program designed to back up Spanish exports to
Cuba. The Spanish Export Credit Insurance Co. held about $780
million in debts on exports to Cuba last year.
   Cuba consumes 15 percent of Spain's trade to Latin America,
according to Economy Ministry figures.

   Palestinian guerrillas and
Syrian-supported Shiite Moslems today stormed southern positions of
Iranian-backed Shiite fundamentalists behind a barrage of artillery
and rocket fire.
   Police said at least 30 people, most believed to be fighters,
were killed and 72 wounded in the battles.
   One Palestinian commander reported by radio from the embattled
hilltop village of Jarjou that fighting was ``hand-to-hand and
house-to-house.''
   Jarjou was captured by the Shiite Moslem Amal militia's rival,
Hezbollah _ or Party of God _ in fierce fighting Monday. The
village is five miles north of Nabatiyeh, the Amal stronghold in
southern Lebanon.
   The assault on Jarjou came on the sixth day of a battle between
the Shiite factions in which more than 100 people have been killed
and more than 300 wounded.
   The first attack began at 3 a.m. when about 300 Amal fighters
and 250 Palestinian Liberation Organization guerrillas began
fighting their way toward the hilltop village of Jarjou.
   It lies on the southwestern tip of an enclave controlled by the
Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The enclave is bordered to the east by Israel's self-designated
``security zone,'' an occupied strip of south Lebanon from which
the Israelis frequently attack guerrilla groups.
   The escalating clashes so close to Israeli-held territory raised
fears that it could provoke Israeli military action.
   Fighters belonging to the Palestine Liberation Organization had
been trying to stop the fighting between the two Shiite groups and
apparently to halt the Hezbollah advance toward Sidon, a southern
port where PLO guerrillas are based.
   The Syrian-backed militia and the Palestinian guerrillas also
have been enemies but they joined together to storm the Hezbollah
positions.
   Reporters close to the battle zone said 40 PLO rocket launchers,
each with 40 barrels, and dozens of Amal mortar batteries blasted
Jarjou and five nearby Hezbollah-held hamlets for two hours before
the first assault was launched.
   Another PLO-Amal force attacked Hezbollah positions along the
northwestern flank of the fundamentalists' enclave. Police said the
attackers were advancing into the village of Kfar Milki ``in savage
fighting.''
   That village, five miles northwest of Jarjou, was occupied by
Hezbollah last January.
   At least 12 wounded Amal men were evacuated from Jarjou to
hospitals in the market town of Nabatiyeh.
   One wounded militiamen told reporters as he was carried from an
ambulance: ``It's hell in there. There are dozens of bodies
scattered in the alleyways.''
   In Beirut, an Amal communique said the assault force had taken
half of Jarjou by midmorning.
   But an Hezbollah statement said the attackers were beaten back,
``leaving scores of dead behind.''
   Black clouds of smoke hung over Jarjou as the Palestinian and
Amal gunners pounded Hezbollah positions to prevent its fighters
from moving up reinforcements through Jarjou's northern edge.
   PLO commanders estimated Hezbollah has about 300 fighters in
Jarjou.
   A 600-man PLO force, drawn mainly from PLO chief Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction, deployed around Jarjou and other villages Tuesday
ostensibly to stop the fighting.
   But their prime objective was to block Hezbollah's advance after
it seized Jarjou. The PLO's main bases are in Sidon, 10 miles
northwest of Jarjou, and Arafat does not want the Iranian-backed
guerrillas threatening them or linking up with anti-Arafat radicals
in the region.
   Hezbollah and Amal have been fighting off and on for three years
for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect.
   More than 1,100 people have been killed and some 3,400 wounded
in the inconclusive showdown between the Shiite rivals.

   Seventeen blacks ended a
sit-in demonstration today after spending the night outside the
U.S. Consulate to protest alleged harrassment by South African
police.
   The blacks accused police of harassing and intimidating
residents in Tumahole, a township about 60 miles southwest of
Johannesburg.
   The demonstrators asked the U.S. government to pressure South
African authorities to stop the alleged intimidation.
   A police spokesman, Maj. Mike Lombard, said authorities had
received no complaints about police actions in Tumahole. There have
been no recent reports of major confrontations in Tumahole between
police and residents.
   U.S. officials accepted a petition from the demonstrators Friday
afternoon but refused to let them stay at the consulate on the 11th
floor of a downtown Johannesburg office building.
   The demonstrators spent the night in a hallway outside the
consulate offices and left the building today singing and dancing.
   Two years ago, three anti-apartheid activists escaped police
detention and stayed at the consulate for more than a month. They
left after the South African government promised the trio they
would not be arrested again.

   Tamil rebels blew up the Elephant Pass
causeway, cutting off the northern Jaffna peninsula from the rest
of the island, military officials said today.
   The rebels control the entire peninsula with the exception of
four beseiged military installations that remain under government
control.
   The government sent trucks carrying food and medicine to Jaffna
peninsula last week, but the Red Cross-escorted convoy is now
stranded south of the demolished causeway, 30 miles south of Jaffna
town, officials said.
   Military officials said the only other road leading to the
peninsula is too small for heavy traffic.
   About 1 million people live on the 830 square mile peninsula.
   Jaffna is the stronghold of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
militia, and has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting
since a new round of the civil war broke out on June 11.
   About 2,730 combatants have been killed since the rebels
violated a 13-month cease-fire in June and renewed fighting.
   Tamil rebels took up arms in 1983 to fight alleged
discrimination by the Sinhalese majority. At least 13,700 people
have been killed in their drive to establish an independent
homeland in the island's north and east.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist, control the
government and the military and make up about 75 percent of the
population.
   Tamil militants are seeking an independent homeland in the
eastern and northern districts of Sri Lanka.
   On Friday, 17 Tamil rebels were killed. Residents of a mainly
Tamil town said three civilians were also killed.
   Ten of the rebels were killed when their boat was blown up by a
helicopter gunship near Vellavelli village south of Batticaloa, 135
miles east of Colombo.
   In Kalmunai, also near Batticaloa, troops ambushed and killed
seven rebels, officials said. Batticaloa residents, contacted by
telephone, said troops shot to death a Tamil woman, her son and
another young Tamil man on Friday when they tried to escape a
search operation.
   The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
dead were known Tiger sympathizers.

<TEXT>
   Filipino miners said they heard
tapping sounds today beneath a hotel destroyed by an earthquake,
raising hopes some victims may be alive five days after the
temblor. The death toll rose to 767.
   More aftershocks rattled Baguio and Manila, 130 miles to the
south, delaying rescue efforts and cracking walls of the Baguio
cathedral. Seismologists said one measured 2 on the Richter scale
in Manila and may have been stronger elsewhere.
   The official death toll from Monday's quake was 767. But
officials said it may approach 1,000 because hundreds were feared
dead in an industrial park and a remote farming area of Nueva
Vizcaya province.
   Also today, Communist rebels declared a unilateral cease-fire in
Manila and the quake-ravaged north. Right-wing military dissidents
offered to do the same on Friday if the government suspended
efforts to capture them.
   Miner Quilino Bagimbin said he crawled through a tunnel beneath
the wrecked Hyatt Hotel and knocked four times against debris
blocking access to the basement gymnasium, where about 10 people
were believed trapped.
   Bagimbin said he heard four distinctive knocks in response.
About 40 people remain unaccounted for at the Hyatt, whose terraced
front collapsed during the quake.
   Another miner, John Dilla, said workers had been hearing the
knocks since Friday night but that they were growing fainter.
Recovery efforts were suspended early today so miners could
strengthen the tunnel after strong aftershocks rocked the area.
   Five days after the earthquake, officials said reports of damage
and deaths were still coming in from remote areas.
   Jose de Jesus, presidential relief coordinator, said 135 people
were believed dead inside eight factories in Baguio but rescuers
had not entered the buildings.
   De Jesus said 108 others were believed killed in landslides in
one village in Nueva Vizcaya. The official tally showed 83 dead in
Nueva Vizcaya.
   Officials said more than 900 people were feared stranded in a
mountain pass along the border of Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija
provinces.
   In Manila, President Corazon Aquino defended her government
against criticism that it had been slow and ineffective in aiding
victims, but the complaints persisted.
   Gangs of armed robbers and looters roamed Baguio after sundown.
   ``There's no sanitation,'' said Australian John Pike, 44, who
was evacuated to Manila today. ``The situation is horrible and not
much is being done. In a week there might be an outbreak of
typhoid.''
   Pike said the government's information network had collapsed and
most people ``don't know where to get information on where to get
relief goods or help.''
   In a statement today to news organizations, the general command
of the communist New People's Army promised to suspend attacks in
Manila and central Luzon ``during this time of national tragedy.''
   Rebel soldiers who tried to topple Mrs. Aquino in December made
the same offer on Friday. Many leaders of the rebel movement are
graduates of the Philippine Military Academy located in Baguio.

   Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed
government today urged the Communist Khmer Rouge guerrilla group
and its main supporter, China, to return to talks on arranging a
cease-fire.
   But Khmer Rouge radio said today the guerrillas were preparing
for a renewed attack on Kompong Thom, capital of the central
province of the same name, 75 miles north of the national capital,
Phnom Penh.
   The radio said hundreds of civilian supporters _ including
children _ were voluntarily carrying supplies, weapons and
ammunition to the guerrillas readying for the strike. The Khmer
Rouge has been known to press civilians into service as porters to
carry their supplies through the jungle.
   The official Cambodian news agency made the appeal for a return
to talks while hailing this week's U.S. policy shift away from the
Khmer Rouge and their non-Communist allies.
   The United States said Wednesday it was withdrawing its
recognition of a guerrilla coalition's seat at the United Nations.
At the same time, Washington will open talks with Vietnam on ending
the Cambodian war.
   Cambodia's government in Phnom Penh has long rejected any
settlement that would allow Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge to return to
power. The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people in
nearly four years of rule until Vietnam's 1978 invasion installed
the current government.
   ``We hope the Khmer Rouge and their patron in Beijing will
return to the negotiating table to resolve the Cambodian problem by
peaceful means,'' the Cambodian news agency SPK said.
   ``As immediate steps,'' it said, they should cooperate in last
month's agreement in Tokyo to begin a truce, stop receiving foreign
military aid and participate in free elections under U.N.
supervision.
   That agreement was signed by Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen,
and Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whose non-Communist guerrilla group is
allied in the coalition with the Khmer Rouge. But the Khmer Rouge
boycotted the Tokyo talks because it said it was not being treated
as an equal. China later said it did not support the agreement
either.
   The agreement was to form a ``supreme national council'' to meet
by July 31 to arrange a truce. The government of Hun Sen, Sihanouk
and Son Sann, the leader of the third guerrilla party, all have
appointed representatives to the council. The Khmer Rouge have not.
   ``The problem with the Tokyo agreement was that the Khmer Rouge
was not involved. If they are not involved, there is no political
solution,'' a spokesman in Sihanouk's Bangkok office, Roland Eng,
said today.
   The guerrillas have significantly escalated their attacks, and
some of their officials said a truce without an overall political
settlement would only benefit the beleaguered Cambodian government.
   The government also has been weakened by internal dissent and a
drastic loss of aid from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

   Rebels have tightened their noose
around President Samuel Doe's mansion, seizing much of the capital
and its port. Washington turned down a desperate appeal by
government officials for U.S. troops to halt the fighting.
   Rebels in this West African country overran most of northern
Monrovia on Friday, capturing the city's 2-square-mile port area in
the northern suburb of Bushrod Island.
   They advanced toward the two bridges linking the island to the
center of the city. Witnesses reported heavy government casualties
but no precise figures. Shipping sources said two Liberian coast
guard cutters were sunk in the port by gunfire.
   The rebels, led by ex-Doe aide Charles Taylor, accuse Doe's
government of corruption and human rights abuses. They have seized
most of this Ohio-sized country of 2.4 million people since they
began fighting in December.
   In Washington, a State Department official said today that U.S.
officials could not say whether Doe has left Liberia.
   ``We've heard various rumors, but I'm not in a position to tell
you it's true,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``There are a lot of rumors coming out of Liberia.''
   A day earlier, the State Department said the United States had
no plans to dispatch a U.S. peacekeeping force as requested by some
Liberian officials.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler confirmed President Bush had
received an appeal from Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson and
eight other prominent Liberians for a temporary U.S. force.
   Most Liberians would welcome U.S. help in ``averting massive
plunder and tribal revenge'' and in having Doe evacuated from the
country, said one of the Liberian signers, former U.N. Ambassador
Winston Tubman.
   But Nelson Taylor, the rebel leader's brother, said the appeal
for U.S. help ``is just one of the scams that Doe is using to
involve the U.S. in a battle with the citizens of Liberia.''
   When asked if the rebels were prepared to fight U.S. forces he
said: ``We will fight until the U.S. can kill every one of us.'' He
spoke from his home in Providence, R.I., and said he represented
the rebel forces.
   In downtown Monrovia, every shop and office was closed Friday.
Nervous troops ordered civilians off the streets in an unofficial
daytime curfew.
   The curfew was in effect throughout the government-controlled
areas and has prevented refugees from reaching Spriggs Payne
Airport to catch the last few flights out of the country.
   Soldiers set up makeshift roadblocks at downtown intersections,
firing wildly into the air to clear terrified civilians off the
streets.
   Hundreds of frightened Monrovians gathered at the gates of the
U.S. Embassy hoping to seek refuge, while scores of others broke
into a U.S. Marine compound demanding food and shelter.
   Representatives of the government and the rebels have met
intermittently for peace talks in neighboring Sierra Leone, but the
negotiations have failed to make any progress.
   The rebels have refused to compromise on their demand that Doe
resign before any cease-fire can be implemented.
   The rebels have accused Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup, of
corruption, mismanagement and widespread human rights abuses.
Taylor has promised to maintain close U.S. ties if he comes to
power, but he has ruled out immediate elections.
   U.S. Ambassador Peter De Vos went in a well-guarded convoy to
the president's mansion Friday morning. An embassy spokesman said
he was received by acting Foreign Minister George Wallace but did
not see Doe. The spokesman said he couldn't tell reporters what was
said during the meeting.
   Diplomatic sources said Doe was surrounded by bodyguards from
his Krahn tribe. The guards were unwilling to let Doe leave the
capital without them.
   There have been extensive discussions on the issue of giving the
Krahn _ who form the bulk of Doe's remaining troops _ a safe
passage through rebel-held areas to their stronghold in Grand Gedeh
county.
   Taylor is reported to have rejected any such safe conduct, which
has contributed to the present stalemate.
   Random killings have been reported on both sides as the
insurgency degenerated into tribal warfare. Most rebels come from
the Gio and Mano tribes, while government supporters are mostly
Krahns and Mandingos.
   The African nation, founded by freed American slaves 150 years
ago, has traditionally had close ties with the United States.

   Two separate firebomb attacks by leftist
guerrillas destroyed a four-story department store, severely
damaged an office supplies company and left four people injured,
police said.
   Two suspects were arrested carrying containers of gasoline near
the fire-gutted Hogar department store in the suburb of San Isidro
after the firebomb attacks Friday night, police said.
   They said four people were injured in the blaze at the
department store, which is owned by one of the country's largest
department store chains. Police did not identify the injured or
give their conditions.
   The main floor of the two-story Lau Chun office supply store
also was destroyed by a blaze caused by firebombs.
   Police said nearly all of the capital's firefighting units were
called out to fight the fires.
   A police bomb squad spokesman said 15 unexploded incendiary
bombs were found in a clothing store in the nearby port of Callao.
A bomb squad unit was able to safely deactivate the bombs.
   There was no claim of responsibility, but police blamed the
attacks and fires on the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group.
   The Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected government
since 1980. Officials say more than 18,500 people have died in the
last decade, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Prime Minister Says Talks Could Start Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's prime minister said negotiations
between the breakaway republic and the Kremlin could begin next
week, a report said today.
   Meanwhile, Lithuania and its independence-minded Baltic
neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, today marked the 50th anniversary of
their annexation into the Soviet Union.
   The Interfax news agency, which is affiliated with Radio Moscow,
said the Lithuanian prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, met
briefly Friday with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   It quoted her as saying the Lithuanian side is prepared to begin
the talks next week and ``the Soviet side is ready for this.''
   She said both sides wanted ``to start negotiations and strive
for a convergence of positions in order to sign an agreement,'' the
report said.
   The way for the talks was cleared when Lithuania agreed on June
29 to place a 100-day moratorium on its March 11 declaration of
independenc as soon as the negotiations formally begin with Soviet
officials.
   After the Lithuanians agreed to the freeze on their declaration,
the Kremlin lifted an economic embargo that had shut off oil
shipments, most natural gas and many other manufactured goods and
raw materials.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said the two sides have been in contact in
advance of the talks. ``I would say that our dialogue now is taking
place in a very calm tone,'' she told Interfax.
   The leader of the Soviet negotiators is Prime Minister Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov.
   A 10-member Lithuanian team, led by two deputy prime ministers,
has already worked out the republic's general stance in the
negotiations.
   The Soviet Union's parliamentary leadership, in observation of
the anniversary of the annexation of the Baltics, called on the
republics to use ``responsibility and good sense'' in dealings with
Moscow.
   The appeal, carried by the official Tass news agency, said
Gorbachev's reforms have given the Baltics and the Soviet Union as
a whole a chance to revamp their relations.
   ``For the first time we have the chance to build our joint
coexistence, in a democratic and good-neighborly way, so that every
nation can take full advantage of the benefits of cooperation,
integration and stable security,'' said the message from Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent countries between
the world wars. But they fell into a Soviet sphere of influence
through a secret deal between Hitler and Stalin in 1939, then were
absorbed into the Soviet Union.

   President Corazon Aquino apologized
Saturday for laughing in public while hundreds of her countrymen
were dying in a devastating earthquake.
   Last Monday, TV crews filmed Mrs. Aquino and several government
officials laughing and joking in the aftermath of the quake, which
shook Manila and surrounding Luzon island.
   Later, Filipinos watched the footage of their president laughing
spliced amid horrifying scenes of crushed victims, frantic
survivors and shattered buildings.
   ``If I offended any of our countrymen because of what happened,
I am asking apology because I did not mean to laugh at this
unfortunate situation,'' Mrs. Aquino said in her weekly radio
program.
   She said she had been meeting with some senators when the quake
struck, and they all dived under a table. ``I want to explain to
you that my laughter was because I was alive along with my
colleagues,'' she said.
   The quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter Scale, caused
relatively little damage in Manila but killed more than 700 people
and damaged thousands of buildings elsewhere in Luzon.

   Chinese and Soviet officials on Saturday signed
agreements to protect investment in each other's countries and
avoid double taxation for their nationals, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
   The agreements were signed at the end of a six-day meeting of
the Sino-Soviet Economic, Trade, Scientific and Technological
Cooperation Committee.
   Chinese Vice Premier Yao Yilin and his Soviet counterpart, U.D.
Maslukov, signed a memorandum for the session, Xinhua said. Its
contents were not disclosed, nor were details of the other
agreements. It was the committee's fifth session.
   Premier Li Peng also met with Maslukov, and told him China is
conducting political reform simultaneously with its economic
reform. He said political reform for China means strengthening
contacts between the ruling Communist Party and the people, and
improving consultation with the eight non-Communist parties that
are allowed to exist under Communist control.
   He also called for growth in Sino-Soviet trade, which totaled
about $3.2 billion last year, and establishment of more joint
ventures. So far, about 20 Sino-Soviet joint ventures have been
established.

   Congress Considers Trade Cutoff With Iraq
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-Iraq relations could take another turn
for the worse if members of Congress are successful in their drive
to cut off virtually all commerce between the two countries.
   The Senate Banking Committee last week unanimously approved
legislation that would deny agricultural and Export-Import Bank
credits to Iraq as well as bar the sale of technological items that
could be used by the military.
   ``It sailed right through committee,'' said Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., sponsor of the amendment. ``I frankly was
amazed.''
   Kassebaum is concerned about Iraq's human rights record,
particularly reports that children have been tortured and murdered
as a way of punishing their parents.
   There have been other reports that Iraq has used chemical
weapons against its own people and is developing nuclear weapons.
   Iraq, a country with 17 million people and the second-largest
proven oil reserves in the world, denies many of the charges,
including those that it used chemical weapons specifically against
its Kurdish minority.
   Mohammed Al-Mashat, Iraq's ambassador in Washington, claims
accusations against Iraq are ``simply planned, organized propaganda
by the Israeli machinery in the United States.''
   Kassebaum's measure _ an amendment to the Export Administration
Act _ is likely to be brought to the Senate floor before the August
recess because lawmakers must meet a deadline to extend the export
act.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., a major player in trying to
isolate Iraq, said sanctions are the only way the United States can
force Hussein to change his ``despotic, tyrannical, deplorable
conduct.''
   ``Iraq is a country where meaningful sanctions could deter its
conduct,'' he said.
   In an interview, Al-Mashat rejected that argument. He said
cutting off credits as well as ending trade would end up hurting
the United States.
   ``We think this is against the U.S. national interest,'' he
said. ``We can buy it (goods) from other countries _ and cheaper.''
   Passage of the legislation in committee coincides with
increasingly bellicose rhetoric from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
and other developments that have soured ties between the United
States and Iraq.
   John Kelly, assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern
affairs, said recently the Bush administration is weighing whether
to place Iraq back on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism,
a designation that halts shipments of technology to Baghdad. Iraq
was taken off the list in 1985.
   Iraq has drawn the ire of U.S. officials for harboring alleged
terrorists, including Abu Abbas, a member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's executive committee who claimed
responsibility for an aborted, ship-launched attack on Israel in
May.
   The Iraqi ambassador said his government has no intention of
acting against Abu Abbas. ``We support the PLO with all the means
possible,'' he said.
   Meantime, Hussein's threats against neighboring Kuwait prompted
a response from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the United
States was committed to come to Kuwait's defense if the country
were attacked by force.
   And the White House moved to block the shipment of three
advanced industrial furnaces because officials were worried they
would be used for projects relating to nuclear weapons.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he urged President Bush to block
the sale at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday. Specter said
he told Bush ``we should not do anything to help Iraq.''
   While the Bush administration says relations with Iraq are not
particularly cordial, it opposes congressional efforts to impose
sanctions.
   ``We want to do it our way,'' said a State Department official,
speaking on condition he not be named.
   Specter, who has met with Hussein this year, agrees
congressional action should only be taken as a last resort.
   He advocates ending credits _ Iraq receives about $20 million
annually in credits from the Ex-Im Bank and has about $500 million
in credits from the Agriculture Department _ but wants the
administration to take the action.
   At the same time, Specter said Iraq is too important a country
to ignore.
   ``They are an emerging major player and tensions are high,
particularly with Israel, he said. ``We should establish a
dialogue.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 48,000 residents of
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have inquired about immigrating
to South Africa so far this year, government-run radio said
Saturday.
   A total of 375 immigrants from Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary and
the Soviet Union arrived in South Africa during the first five
months of 1990, the South African Broadcasting Corp. added.
   South Africa does not have diplomatic relations with any Eastern
European nations. But since the collapse of Communist governments
in Eastern Europe, thousands of their citizens have been visiting
South African Embassies in Western Europe to apply for immigration,
the Department of Foreign Affairs said.
   About 7,000 Soviet citizens have written, phoned or visited the
South African Embassy in Finland this year, and inquires are
running at about 100 a day, officials said.
   With its year-round sunny weather and the strongest economy on
the continent, South Africa long has attracted immigrants from
Western Europe. The government encourages immigration by skilled
professionals, saying they are needed to help develop the economy.
   However, anti-apartheid groups oppose the recruitment of whites
from abroad, saying the government should do more to train blacks.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system, the 5 million whites
dominate politics and the economy and the 30 million blacks have no
voice in national affairs. Residential areas, schools and politics
are the main institutions that remain legally segregated. Many
other facilities have been integrated in recent years.

   The federal government is far more aggressive
in prosecuting employers who violate environmental laws than those
who jeopardize their workers' safety, a study released Saturday
says.
   ``The federal establishment cares much more about water
polluters than workplace killers,'' said Joseph Kinney, executive
director of the National Safe Workplace Institute, which conducted
the study.
   He said the nation's 20-year-old Occupational Safety and Health
Administration act is ``more dream than reality.''
   Since 1970, the Labor and Justice departments have put only one
employer behind bars for safety violations that caused the death of
a worker, the report said.
   But during a four-year period, the federal government has won
environmental jail terms totaling 271 years, said the Chicago
group, a private organization that calls itself a government
accountability institute.
   ``There has been an outrageous neglect of worker safety issues
by the federal government,'' said Kinney, who helped found the
institute three years ago after his brother was killed in an
on-the-job accident.
   Spokesmen for both the Labor and Justice departments noted that
courts, not the federal government, control what kind of sentences
are given to defendants once they are convicted.
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said that since the
OSHA law was passed in 1970, his agency has received referrals of
about 40 cases from the Labor Department for criminal prosecution.
The Justice Department has handled about one-third of those cases,
he said.
   Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, noted that Mrs. Dole pushed for and obtained an additional
177 inspectors for OSHA during her first year at the department.
She also has backed stiffer penalties for employers who violate
OSHA laws, Ms. Schneider said.
   ``It shows that we are committed to health and safety for
American workers,'' Ms. Schneider said. ``We feel we've made a
great effort to enforce the law, including criminal prosecution and
increased criminal sanctions.''
   In the past, OSHA has come under fire for issuing large fines
against employers but then settling for small sums. The agency has
defended the process, saying OSHA's purpose is to ensure that
employers comply with laws, rather than collect large amounts of
money for the government.
   Kinney said that in OSHA's 20-year history, only one employer
has been incarcerated, and that was the owner of a South Dakota
plumbing company who received a 45-day jail term for violations
involving a 1988 trench cave-in that killed two workers.
   In contrast, in 1989 alone, there were 51 individuals convicted
of environmental crimes and they were sentenced to an average of
6.4 months in jail with an additional probation period of 20.5
months, the study said.
   In 1986, the first person convicted and incarcerated for Clean
Water Act violations was the manager of a yeast plant in Sumner,
Wash., who received a one-year term for dumping yeast in a
waterway, the study said.
   Earlier this year, a Pennsylvania man was sentenced to three
years for dumping sludge in a wetlands area, Kinney said.
   ``It's absolutely outrageous. OSHA is the only agency where you
have to have a dead body to prosecute,'' Kinney said.
   The group called for the Labor Department to back a bill pending
in Congress to strengthen the jail terms for OSHA violators.
   Mrs. Dole has agreed to support stiffer fines, but has given
only limited support to the tougher jail terms. The Labor
Department has said in the past it believes courts should have
discretion in sentencing violators.
   The AFL-CIO, which represents about 14.2 million unionized
workers, estimates 10,000 workers are killed on the job each year
while another 70,000 are permanently disabled.

   Two former mayors of Palermo were
sentenced to prison terms Saturday for abuse of public office and
improperly awarding government contracts.
   One of the convicted men, Vito Ciancimino, has been dubbed ``Don
Vito' by the Italian press for his alleged ties to the Palermo-area
based Corleone crime family. The Christian Democrat was sentenced
to three years and two months in prison.
   Another former mayor, Carmelo Scoma, received the same sentence
for abuse of office.
   The two men were convicted Friday along with three other people
who worked for the city and a sixth defendant who administered the
company that held the city's street cleaning and sewer maintainance
contracts for decades.
   Three defendants were acquitted after the court heard evidence
gathered in a 10-year investigation of the city's granting of
public service contracts. Palermo has some of Italy's worst slums.
   In a separate case, Ciancimino was charged in June with
embezzlement, conflict of interest in awarding a public works
contract, and having criminal ties.

   City buses in the South African

   Local municipal buses had previously been reserved for whites in
Pretoria. Bus service in other major cities, such as Cape Town,
Johannesburg and Durban, already have been desegregated.
   Non-racial transportation in the rest of the country is expected
to be introduced in October, when the Separate Amenities Act is
repealed. The law from the 1950s allows local governments to set
aside public facilities for certain races.
   In June, the National Party government passed a bill repealing
the Separate Amenities Act. The bill becomes effective in October
to give people time to adjust, the government has said.

   Yale University's rare book library is
taking advantage of the dog days of summer to honor one of
literature's most famous canine characters, the cunning collie,
Lassie.
   The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, a grand
marble-and-granite building, is celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the publication of ``Lassie Come-Home'' with an exhibit drawn from
the papers of author Eric Knight.
   The ``Lassie at 50'' display includes the first printing of a
shorter version of the story in The Saturday Evening Post; the
original manuscript of the 1940 novel; Lassie fan mail; and
photographs from the 1943 movie version of the book.
   ``In the summer we look for something a little lighter,'' said
Christa Sammons, a library curator. ``It surprises people. You come
in here and expect to see old books and esoteric things and here's
something everyone can identify with.''
   ``What they like about it most is they recognize the dog,'' said
Nancy LeRoy, the research assistant who prepared the exhibit.
   Lassie came home to Yale in 1948, when Knight's widow, Jere
Knight Lindter, donated a 10-foot-thick collection of her husband's
papers to the university.
   An Englishman who spent most of his life in the United States,
Knight became a U.S. citizen in 1942, and was commissioned a
captain in the Special Services Division. He was killed in 1943
when his transport plane crashed in Dutch Guiana (now Suriname).
   Knight wrote six novels, a novella, a collection of short
stories, newspaper and magazine articles, drama and movie reviews,
and had an unsuccessful stint in the mid-1930s as a Hollywood
scriptwriter. He also did cartoons and sketches, including a
self-portrait featured in the Yale exhibit.
   He first wrote about Lassie in a story that appeared Dec. 17,
1938, in The Saturday Evening Post. A marked-up copy of the
magazine article that Knight transformed into a novel is
prominently featured in the exhibit.
   Impoverished Yorkshire, where Knight was raised by an uncle and
aunt after his father died, was the setting for ``Lassie
Come-Home.''
   In the novel, Sam Carraclough, a poor Yorkshire miner, is forced
to sell Lassie to the Duke of Rudley. But forever faithful to Sam's
son, Joe, Lassie flees Rudley's Scotland estate and travels by
himself hundreds of miles back to Yorkshire.
   Rudley pursues the dog, but when he finds the collie reunited
with the Carracloughs, he lets them keep their dog.
   In the television series that ran from 1954 to 1971, the setting
and the storyline were changed.
   Knight had insisted the book, which was translated into 13
languages, was written for both adults and children.
   But schoolchildren were the novel's greatest fans, and hundreds
wrote to him in appreciation. In the Yale exhibit, a sampling of
the fan mail is displayed on a lower shelf so children can see them.
   ``I am not a crying type over books but in some parts of your
book as I was reading along I found myself really tightening up and
almost crying over some of Lassie's adventures,'' a girl from
Kalamazoo, Mich., wrote to Knight in 1941.
   Photographs include a still of Roddy McDowall, who played Joe in
the original movie, lying on the crest of a hill with his arm
draped over Pal _ the male collie who played Lassie. There is also
a shot of Knight with his collie, whose name was Toots.
   Knight was very pleased with the dog they chose for the movie,
LeRoy said.
   Some of the translations of ``Lassie Come-Home'' also are in the
exhibit, which runs through the end of September, as well as copies
of other Knight works, including his 1938 novella, ``The Flying
Yorkshireman,'' his first success as an author, and his last novel,
``This Above All.''
   ``This Above All,'' a love story set during the Battle of
Britain, was a best seller in both the United States and Britain
and was made into a 1942 movie starring Joan Fontaine and Tyrone
Power.

   A day after a federal appeals court set
aside one of his Iran-Contra convictions, Oliver North stumped
Louisiana for a Republican Senate candidate and lambasted
Washington politics.
   ``I am indeed grateful _ grateful to stand here as a man who can
once again vote,'' North said at a rally today for Senate candidate
Ben Bagert. It was one of the few references he made to Friday's
legal victory.
   North launched into his standard anti-Washington rhetoric,
calling Washington ``the swamp on the Potomac,'' while he praised
Bagert.
   Bagert is the state Republican party's endorsed candidate,
running against 18-year Democratic incumbent J. Bennett Johnston,
who has a strong lead in all recent polls. Running second is David
Duke, under constant fire for his past as a former Ku Klux Klan
grand wizard with ties to neo-Nazis. The three face off in the
state's Oct. 6 open primary.
   North never mentioned Duke by name. But, in an apparent
reference to Duke, North said there was no place in the country for
``the politics of hate.''
   After leaving this Shreveport suburb, North planned appearances
in Monroe, Alexandria and New Orleans on Bagert's behalf. Bagert
said he is paying North for his appearances but wouldn't say how
much except to say it was not very much.
   The appeals court panel voted 2-1 Friday to reverse one of
North's convictions and ordered a judge to review the evidence to
determine whether all three convictions were tainted by ties to
testimony he gave Congress under immunity.
   ``It has been what we believe to be a major step in the right
direction and what has been a long and difficult ordeal,'' the
former Marine lieutenant colonel and White House aide said in a
speech Friday night in Baton Rouge.
   In Washington, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel suggested
that North's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination may
have been violated.
   The ruling also could spell trouble for the Iran-Contra case
against John Poindexter, who was convicted of five felonies in
April. Like North, the former national security adviser had given
immunized public testimony to Congress in 1987.
   Congress offered the grants of immunity as it tried to quickly
determine what happened in the Iran-Contra affair, the Reagan
administration's sale of arms to Iran and diversion of some of the
proceeds to rebels fighting Nicaragua's Marxist government.
   In six days of compelled, nationally televised testimony in July
1987, North admitted to many of the activities for which he was
later charged with crimes.
   A jury convicted North on May 4, 1989, of three of the 12
charges he faced:
   _Aiding and abetting an obstruction of Congress in connection
with a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   _Altering and destroying National Security Council documents
detailing his efforts to provide military assistance to the Contras.
   _Accepting an illegal gratuity, a $13,800 home security system,
from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, whom North had
enlisted to get arms to the Contras and assist the Reagan
administration's initiative toward Iran.
   ``I certainly hope the special prosecutor ends it now,'' North
said. ``We've been under a virtual siege.''
   The special prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, who is supervising the
continuing Iran-Contra investigation, said only, ``Everyone
familiar with these proceedings has recognized the difficulties
presented by the grant of immunity by Congress.''
   President Bush told reporters: ``I think this is good news. I
have not wanted to see the North matter go any further.''
   Walsh could seek review of the ruling by all 12 members of the
appeals court or he could go directly to the Supreme Court.
   The appeals panel reversed one of North's convictions, blaming
faulty jury instructions from U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell,
the trial judge. That conviction could be reinstated only through a
new trial.
   The panel reversed North's conviction for altering and
destroying security council documents, saying Gesell had given an
erroneous instruction to the jury on how to weigh evidence of what
superiors might have told North to do.
   Gesell could reinstate the two remaining convictions if he found
they had not been tainted by North's immunized testimony.
   Gesell's inquiry ``must proceed witness-by-witness; if
necessary, it will proceed line-by-line and item-by-item,'' the
appeals court said in an opinion supported by judges Laurence
Silberman and David Sentelle, both Reagan appointees.
   Chief judge Patricia Wald, a Carter appointee, dissented, saying
she was ``satisfied that North received a fair trial'' and received
``all of the constitutional protections to which he was entitled.''
   The majority held that the government must show by ``a
preponderance of the evidence'' that no use was made of North's
immunized testimony either by witnesses or by the Iran-Contra
prosecutor's office.
   North's conviction for destroying security council documents led
to his $23,100-a-year Marine pension being revoked.
   In Baton Rouge, North said at a reception for Bagert: ``I guess
they'll give me my retirement benefits again.''
   A Marine Corps spokesman said that if North's attorney requests
a review, ``that would be something that the Marine Corps would
have to look at.''

   President Bush today used the gleaming
backdrop of a new U.S. aircraft carrier to fortify his argument
against weakening U.S. defenses in the post-Cold War era.
   ``We must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed
forces sufficient to sustain our vital national interests,'' Bush
said at a christening ceremony for the nation's newest Nimitz-class
carrier, the George Washington.
   Barbara Bush, with the president at her side, smashed a bottle
of champagne against the ship's hull to formally dedicate the giant
vessel in a shipyard where 240 other Navy vessels have been
constructed.
   The 1,040-foot, nuclear-powered vessel, built at a cost of $3.1
billion, is to enter service in 1992.
   Standing directly under the carrier's massive bow, the president
quoted the nation's first president, for whom the ship was named,
as saying `` `to be prepared for war is one of the most effective
means of preserving the peace.' ''
   Bush, a World War II Navy aviator who flew combat missions from
a Pacific-based carrier, wore a navy blue tie adorned with gold
Navy aviator wings.
   The trip to Newport News coincided with congressional debate
over whether to shrink the Navy's carrier battle group fleet. The
George Washington is the sixth of the Nimitz-class carriers to be
built for the Navy. Two more are under construction. Fifteen
carriers now are in active service.
   On Friday, during a tour of Warren Air Force Base near Cheyenne,
Wyo., home of the nation's arsenal of MX intercontinental missiles,
Bush indicated he was willing to accept limited cuts in his 1991
defense budget request.
   Last week, the Senate Armed Services Committee, firing an
opening salvo in the battle over the first post-Cold War budget,
voted to cut $18 billion from Bush's request for $307 billion in
defense spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   The House Armed Services Committee has yet to act on the budget
but is expected to take an even bigger bite out of the
administration's 6-month-old proposal.
   ``I'm asking Congress to hold the line at the already painful
reduction in the defense budget set down by the Senate Armed
Services Committee,'' the president said Friday.
   ``There were some positive things from the committee, especially
their support for strategic modernization, as well as some other
actions, on the other hand, that cause me problems.''
   He did not elaborate on the ``problems'' except to say he would
like more latitude in making personnel cuts than the committee
proposed.
   Speaking to several hundred workers at Warren Air Force Base,
the president said:
   ``I especially need ... flexibility so that the bedrock of the
military, its highly trained, highly motivated and exceptionally
dedicated men and women, people such as you, will be protected. I
cannot support reductions in the defense budget that would unfairly
penalize those of you who have given so much to our country.''
   Bush stressed that while he could accept a lower 1991 spending
total, he was not going to let Congress hold ``some kind of fire
sale'' of U.S. military assets.
   ``As we strive for strength and stability, we must maintain an
effective deterrent, especially in the face of continuing
across-the-board modernization of the Soviet strategic forces,''
Bush said.
   ``This won't be easy in the fiscal environment we face now. We
all recognize that we must get the deficit under control and that
defense will contribute its share. But I don't want defense to
contribute more than its share.''
   Bush toured the silos at Warren that hold all 50 MXs, the
nation's most modern long-range nuclear missiles.
   The president is pushing for $2.2 billion in 1991 to take the
launchers for the 10-warhead missiles out of their silos and place
them on rail cars to make them less vulnerable to attack. Critics
argue that current U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations are likely
to lead to a ban on mobile missiles.
   Reflecting a growing conviction in Congress that the demise of
the Soviet military threat should mean big cuts in U.S. defenses,
the Senate Armed Services Committee cut $1.6 billion from Bush's MX
plan. It left in $548 million for research but prohibited any
spending on procurement or construction.

   A ceiling collapsed on shoppers in a
supermarket Saturday, killing two people and injuring 17,
authorities said.
   A space above the ceiling was used for storing packages of food.
   ``I heard a sudden explosion and then the screams of the many
people inside,'' said one shopper, who escaped injury from falling
containers of food.
   So big were the mounds of canned goods and other groceries that
landed on shoppers that it took police about four hours to drag out
the dead and wounded.
   The discount supermarket Save-On is on the edge of the town of
Paola, about four miles south of Valletta.
   Authorities were conducting an investigation into the collapse.

<HEAD>Bush Searching for Successor to Supreme Court's Leading Liberal</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top 8 grafs with meetings continuing, more names of possible

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, moving quickly in the wake of
Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan's surprise retirement, met
today with top aides to discuss possible successors to the high
court's leading liberal jurist.
   ``I am going to try to make this determination as soon as
possible,'' Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One. ``The process
is moving.''
   Participating in the 75-minute White House meeting were Bush,
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu and presidential counsel C. Boyden Gray. Bush declined
to reveal the names of those discussed as possible Supreme Court
nominees.
   As Bush flew to Newport News, Va., for a ship christening,
Thornburgh and Gray continued their discussions at the Justice
Department.
   The administration is reviewing about 15 candidates, officials
said.
   Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, the government's top
courtroom lawyer, has been mentioned as a leading possibility for a
high court vacancy. Starr gave up a federal judgeship to take the
Justice Department job.
   Other possible candidates include a number of federal appeals
judges, including Ralph K. Winter of the 2nd Circuit, J. Harvie
Wilkinson III of the 4th Circuit, Patrick E. Higginbotham of the
5th Circuit and Clarence Thomas of the District of Columbia Circuit
in Washington. Others who have been mentioned have been U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   The list also includes appellate judges Edith H. Jones of the
5th Circuit, William W. Wilkens Jr. of the 4th Circuit and chairman
of the U.S. Sentencing Commission; and David Souter, a former New
Hampshire Supreme Court judge who now sits on the 1st Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston.
   Bush's choice will help determine the court's approach _
possibly well into the next century _ to abortion rights,
affirmative action, freedom of expression and other contentious
issues.
   The Republican president said he intends to choose the best
qualified person, even if it means triggering a confirmation battle
in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
   ``The matter is now official and we will now start the process
of finding a successor,'' Bush said. He received a facsimile of
Brennan's resignation letter as he boarded Air Force One in Wyoming
on Friday. The Supreme Court had hand-delivered a copy of the
letter to the White House at 7:40 p.m. EDT.
   ``I've always said I want somebody who will be on there not to
legislate from the bench but to faithfully interpret the
Constitution,'' Bush said. ``So that gives me a wide latitude. But
I do not plan at this point to talk about any issues or any
judicial philosophy.''
   The stakes are unusually high in picking a successor to Brennan,
84. He has been the liberals' leading voice on an increasingly
conservative court and, by most accounts, has been their most
skillful negotiator in helping preserve past liberal victories.
   Brennan's departure is ``an incalculable loss to the law and
civil liberties and to every person whose rights are threatened in
the United States,'' Norman Dorsen, president of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said.
   The battle lines over abortion already are forming.
   ``I've been saying for months that the threat to our right to
choose is as close as the next Supreme Court appointment,'' Kate
Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said, adding, ``It's a very, very dark day.''
   The Iowa Right to Life Committee said, ``The appointment of one
more justice who believes that all human life, both born and
unborn, deserves protection, will be the beginning toward our
country once again protecting pre-born life.''
   The high court split, 5-4, last year in giving states broad new
power to limit abortions. Last month by the same vote, the justices
said states generally may require that unmarried teen-age girls
notify parents before getting an abortion.
   On both occasions, the court stopped short of overturning its
1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade that said women have a constitutional
right to abortion.
   Bush said, ``It's not like we're starting from ground zero'' in
picking Brennan's replacement. But he refused to drop any hints on
leading candidates.
   The conservative court is led by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and includes three appointees of former President Reagan
_ Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy. A fifth conservative vote often is provided by Justice
Byron R. White.
   The liberal wing that Brennan often led now is reduced to
Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Brennan said he decided to end his 34-year career on the court _
one that spanned the administrations of eight presidents _ because
of his ``advancing age and medical condition.''
   He suffered a small stroke after the term ended, falling down in
Newark Airport en route to a Scandinavian vacation, court
spokeswoman Toni House said. Brennan's doctor advised him to
``avoid stress and strain and consider retiring,'' Ms. House said.
   In a letter of resignation to Bush, Brennan said: ``Strenuous
demands of court work and its related duties required or expected
of a justice appear at this time to be incompatible with my
advancing age and medical condition.''
   Appointed to the court by President Eisenhower in 1956, Brennan
quickly found a home among the liberal majority led by Chief
Justice Earl Warren.
   As the court changed over the next three decades and the balance
of power moved to the right, Brennan played a key role in
preserving liberal victories while also speaking out numerous times
as a dissenter defending individual rights.
   Among the more than 1,200 opinions he wrote are landmarks that
imposed a ``one-person, one-vote'' standard for electing state
legislatures, created constitutional protections for libel lawsuit
defendants and helped invent a legal definition of obscenity.

<HEAD>Kohl Shakes Old Image On Way To Goal of Leading Unified Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of the most extraordinary
political journeys of modern times, Helmut Kohl has shaken off his
image as a plodding, unimaginative politician and positioned
himself to become the first chancellor of a united Germany.
   The road has not been smooth. As his ratings have risen and
fallen over the years, Kohl has been written off by critics so many
times that his survival as chancellor seems almost miraculous.
   But early last week, the portly conservative proved what his
supporters long maintained: He is a patient and skillful bargainer,
an ambitious man with an even more ambitious vision for Germany.
   At a meeting in the Soviet Union, Kohl won President Mikhail
Gorbachev's approval of NATO membership for a united Germany and
the promise to withdraw all Soviet troops from East Germany by 1994.
   The agreements cleared the biggest obstacles to German
unification, which can now be sealed in all-German elections in
December.
   Germany, divided for 45 years of Cold War animosity, will have
nearly 80 million citizens after unification. It will be the most
powerful, prosperous nation in Western Europe and a high-stakes
player in global politics.
   The diplomatic coup in Moscow, Kohl acknowledged, was a high
point of his career.
   ``This day, these 24 hours, belong to the most important
experiences of my life,'' the jubilant chancellor told reporters
after returning to Bonn.
   Newspapers across the country's political spectrum hailed the
deal.
   The mass-circulation Bild, usually a government supporter,
nonetheless proclaimed Wednesday, ``The world is astonished at Kohl
_ Adenauer and Brandt outdone.''
   Konrad Adenauer was West Germany's first chancellor, who led the
country from World War II's ruins to democracy and membership in
the Western alliance. Willy Brandt, chancellor from 1969-74, won a
Nobel Peace Prize for formulating ``Ostpolitik,'' West Germany's
rapproachement to the East.
   Even Kohl's political opponents congratulated the Christian
Democratic Union leader, including Oskar Lafontaine, the opposition
Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor in the next elections.
   Kohl's public opinion rating has surged. The latest poll, by the
research institute INFAS, said an unprecedented 61 percent of 800
West Germans polled supported Kohl as chancellor.
   ``I think it was statesmanship at its best,'' said Klaus Becher,
a foreign policy analyst for the private, non-partisan German
Society for Foreign Affairs in Bonn.
   ``The magnitude of what he has done is miraculous,'' echoed Hans
Binnendijk at the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies. ``Part of it was, I suppose, being at the right
place at the right time. ... But being there at the right time, he
made the most of it.''
   Kohl, 60, has seldom had such moments of political eloquence
since taking office in October 1982.
   He frightened Poles and worried allies earlier this year by
playing to conservatives at home and not immediately assuring the
inviolability of Poland's western border. One-third of Poland is
former German territory, and Poles feared possible German
revanchism.
   Both German states have since vowed to respect the border and to
sign a treaty guaranteeing the frontier after unification.
   In a 1986 interview with Newsweek, Kohl caused an uproar when he
likened Gorbachev's public relations skills to those of the
infamous Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels.
   And he stirred international controversy in 1985 when he invited
former President Reagan to Bitburg to visit a war cemetery that
included the graves of 49 Nazi SS soldiers.
   ``I would say that a man grows with his tasks,'' Gerhard Wettig,
a leading analyst at the Federal Institute for Soviet and
International Studies in Cologne, said in explaining Kohl's earlier
blunders.
   But he said Kohl had also been underrated.
   ``As a rule is he not intellectually brilliant as was Helmut
Schmidt,'' Wettig said, referring to another former chancellor.
   ``But he is a very clever and ... to some degree wise politician
who is able to accomplish a lot of things which you would not guess
when just having talked with him a few times.''
   Said Binnendijk: ``Obviously, he is a politician who works from
the gut and his instincts are very good... He's not a smooth or
urbane politician. In American terms, you'd say he's a very clever
Chicago politician.''
   Kohl has an ability to appeal to ordinary Germans, analysts said.
   ``When he's talking it's not too different from a man in the
street. His sentences are simple, his thoughts are not
complicated,'' Wettig said.

   The $3.57 billion aircraft carrier
George Washington was christened today as a crowd of more than
15,000 stood, waving flags and cheering.
   The nuclear-powered carrier was built in more than 150 huge
modular sections at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., the
only shipyard in the nation capable of building the
1,092-foot-long, 91,487-ton vessels.
   President Bush today praised the thousands of workers who helped
build the carrier and said it represents America's commitment to
liberty.
   Bush called aircraft carriers ``an indispensable element of our
nation's defense, projecting power and preserving peace. ... So
today, we must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed
forces sufficient to sustain our national interest.'' First lady
Barbara Bush officially christened the ship.
   The ship is to be commissioned next year. The Navy commissioned
the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln this year, and has two other
Nimitz-class carriers under construction at Newport News.
   The Washington, built under the supervision of W.B. ``Miff''
Miffleton and James S. Morris, is the third Nimitz-class carrier to
be assembled according to a modular plan involving 100-ton-or-more
sections called ``super lifts.''
   In the modular process, ``super lifts'' are built in workshops
and later lifted into place by crane to be welded together. The
process saved about $80 million and some 17 months in construction
time.
   The biggest piece is the 700-ton bow section. The deck house is
seven decks high, weighs 454 tons and lays atop the 4{-acre flight
deck. They were lowered into place by a 900-ton crane that was
built especially for carrier construction.
   Each of the Nimitz-class carriers takes six years and 10,000
workers to complete. Before modular construction, the ships were
built one 40-foot-by-30-foot panel at a time.
   ``It was sort of like building a large house of cards,''
Miffleton said. Christening of the ship is the high point for the
workers.
   ``It's like a fever that runs through the gang. There may be as
many as 2,000 to 3,000 workers on the ship at any one time. They
all feel they have a stake in her,'' said Morris, veteran of 38
years in the yard.
   When the George Washington is commissioned, it will be home to
2,800 officers and men. Another 2,700 will be aboard when the ship
adds its air wing of 85 aircraft.
   The carrier measures 1,040 feet from bow to stern and 1,092 feet
on its flight deck. From its keel to the top of its mast, it is 244
feet high _ the equivalent of a 24-story building.
   Its top speed is about 45 mph.

   The new president of Carnegie Mellon
University has decided to rent a house at his own expense rather
than depend on the school to buy a residence for him, as it did for
his predecessors.
   Robert Mehrabian, who took office July 1, made his intentions
known Friday in an open letter to CMU.
   Two weeks ago, CMU trustees disclosed plans to buy a 16-acre
estate for Mehrabian and his wife at a reported price of $1.9
million. School officials said they wanted a house with substantial
grounds because the Mehrabians own six horses.
   But after the purchase price was publicized, the deal was called
off.
   Mehrabian said in his letter: ``I have relieved the Board of
Trustees of all responsibility for providing a house for my wife
and me.''
   Mehrabian has been dean of the College of Engineering at the
University of California at Santa Barbara.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's abandoning his no-new-taxes
pledges may have triggered a firestorm in the capital, but it has
not set off alarms elsewhere, judging from the reception Bush got
on a four-state Western swing.
   As Bush headed off to California on Wednesday, House Republicans
were voting en masse to declare their opposition to tax increases
in any form, including tinkering with the maximum tax rates on
upper-income earners.
   That was just the latest display of unhappiness in the ranks of
GOP lawmakers about Bush's confession last month that solving the
deficit problem would require ``tax revenue increases.''
   Coming from the man who made ``Read my lips: no new tax'' the
mantra of his landslide 1988 campaign, the reversal may have caused
some erosion in Bush's popularity. His sky-high approval ratings
have dipped from a lofty 80 percent to 63 percent in a recent
Gallup Poll.
   But the crowds that lined the streets outside the Nixon library
in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Thursday morning and later in Boise,
Idaho, and Billings, Mont., were waving flags and ``Welcome, Mr.
President'' signs, not tax rebellion banners.
   He also got a rousing Western welcome in the rain in Cheyenne,
Wyo., where cheering crowds turned out for a White House parade
grafted onto the city's Frontier Days celebration.
   Bush himself broached the tax issue, if gingerly, at a
fund-raising dinner for Republican Senate candidate Larry Craig in
Boise on Thursday evening.
   ``You've seen the firestorm about revenues being on the table,''
he told the party faithful.
   ``Well, I've done my part and now it's their turn,'' he said,
prodding Congress to show its hands on spending cuts.
   The next morning in Billings, he told another GOP fund-raiser,
``I've taken a few shots. You've heard it rebounding around out
here. I've said before that I'll negotiate without preconditions,
and I will, in spite of the outcry about revenues.''
   Bush, on the flight home Friday night, told reporters, ``I
didn't hear too much talk about tax increases, but I sure got a lot
of people mentioning to me in these side meetings about doing
something about getting the federal deficit down.''
   ``Maybe people understand my view on that. I was very pleased
with what I felt was support from the people to whom I was
speaking, which in these instances were largely Republican
audiences. They seemed to be supportive of what I was saying,'' the
president said.
   Bush is building up to what aides say will be almost non-stop
campaigning this fall for Republican candidates, especially Senate
races. Bush's fondest dream is that the voters will give him what
Ronald Reagan enjoyed for six years of his presidency: control of
the Senate, where Democrats now hold a 55-45 edge.
   But Bush's retreat on tax increases has taken a powerful
campaign weapon out of the hands of Republican hopefuls, who were
only too happy to join the old Bush in taking the no-new-taxes
pledge.
   There was a schizophrenic quality to much of Bush's campaign
trip on this political foray. In one breath he lambasted the
Democrats as the party on ``the far side'' and blamed them for
``government by gridlock,'' the skyrocketing deficit and pork
barrel spending.
   In the next, he told GOP loyalists in Billings, ``Frankly, I
think in fairness to say we are getting some good cooperation with
the leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle'' in the budget
negotiations.
   It may be that the public took Bush's no-new-taxes pledge with a
grain of salt in the first place, or perhaps they have learned not
to get too excited about the talk of higher taxes until they see
what Bush and the leaders of Congress actually come up with.
   But White House officials say it came as no surprise to them
that taxes did not generate much excitement _ or resentment _ on
this trip.
   ``It hasn't been a factor at all,'' White House deputy chief of
staff Andrew Card said as he stood by the president's rain-swept
stage outside the gold-domed Wyoming State Capitol on Friday.
   ``I think people respect his leadership and recognize that he is
meeting with very difficult responsibilities'' in trying ``to
generate some governing in Washington,'' Card said.
   And what kind of reception will Bush get if the budget
summitteers actually hit people in the pocketbook?
   ``I'm sure there will be some reaction,'' Card said. But he
added, ``As long as the people are not abused in the process, I
think they'll accept the results.''

   The United States has opened the way
for new approaches to peace in Cambodia, but Khmer Rouge guerrillas
may escalate the fighting unless China goes along.
   On Wednesday, the United States announced it was withdrawing
recognition of the guerrilla coalition's seat at the United Nations
in order to open talks with Vietnam on ending the war. Although the
coalition has three factions, two of them non-Communist, the
Beijing-supported Khmer Rouge is by far the strongest.
   Because of the U.S. action, ``all of us can look forward with
confidence to the whole (peace) process having new momentum,'' said
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of Australia, a key mediator on
Cambodia.
   Washington's decision widened the gulf between it and China, but
brought the United States closer to the Soviet Union, the main ally
of Hanoi and the Vietnamese-sponsored government of Cambodia.
   Evans noted the talks on Cambodia to be held this week in
Indonesia by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, United
States, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Community.
   The Bush administration changed the U.S. position after American
intelligence reported increased Khmer Rouge assaults reminiscent of
those that brought it to power in April 1975.
   By the time Vietnamese forces invaded in December 1978, the
Khmer Rouge had slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people in
labor camps and execution chambers, and hundreds of thousands more
had died of starvation.
   Its 30,000 fighters are the dominant force in the guerrilla
coalition. The other factions are led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
the former ruler of Cambodia, and Son Sann.
   Many non-Communist resistance leaders say the U.S. shift will
drive the Khmer Rouge closer to China and convince its leaders they
must win militarily because they have been shut out of a political
settlement.
   Sihanouk, overall leader of the coalition, expressed anger at
the U.S. action and said the insurgents would be ``more firm and
fierce in their determination to continue to resist.''
   China has said it will halt aid only when other countries do and
only when a comprehensive political settlement is reached, and
demands the Khmer Rouge be included in a settlement. U.S.
intelligence agencies estimate it gives the Khmer Rouge $100
million worth of aid annually.
   ``I haven't seen any sign that they're softening on either of
these positions,'' a Western diplomat in Beijing said of the
Chinese.
   He said China wanted to remain the region's dominant power and
was trying to head off Vietnamese attempts to forge an Indochinese
bloc by controlling Cambodia and Laos. China does not seek direct
influence in Cambodia, but wants to ensure its neutrality, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats also said China has been serious in talks on Cambodia
with the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France, the other
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   ``The Chinese appear to us to have all sorts of options in their
bag,'' De Montigny Marchand, Canadian undersecretary of state for
foreign affairs, said Thursday after talks in Beijing. ``They
struck me as not being as doctrinaire as I expected them to be.''
   Moscow has sharply reduced its economic aid and political
support, so Vietnam and its client government in Phnom Penh may be
more amenable to concessions.
   The U.S. dialogue with Vietnam, their first political talks
since the Vietnam war ended 15 years ago, has inspired hope that
Hanoi will put pressure on Phnom Penh to make peace.
   Vietnam knows settling the war is essential to achieving normal
relations with the United States, which are critical to ending its
isolation and solving its economic problems.
   Hope also flowered, however, when Vietnam and China began talks
on Cambodia in January 1989. In June, the fourth round collapsed in
mutual recrimination.
   Despite many negotiations over 2{ years, the factions still
disagree on who would govern until general elections. The
government wants to retain interim power and rejects any
significant Khmer Rouge role; the guerrillas demand a four-party
coalition government or a U.N. authority.
   Diplomats said the U.S. change could help induce Vietnam and the
Cambodian government to accept a U.N. authority, which they have
rejected because the guerrilla coaltion occupies the Cambodian seat.
   Cambodia's state news agency said the American decision would
``enable the United Nations to play its honorable and appropriate
role'' in a settlement. Vietnam expressed willingness to negotiate
an early solution.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet sailor who says he overstayed his U.S.
welcome to satisfy his curiosity about America has been freed after
25 days in immigration detention.
   ``I am very glad!'' Nikolaj Vetkovskij shouted Friday as he ran
from the detention center at the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service office. Asked why his release took an hour
after bail was posted, he added, ``Burocratya! Burocratya!''
   But bureaucracy _ in the form of hearings on his status _ also
may keep Nick, as his adoptive American family calls him, in the
United States long enough for him to satisfy more of his curiosity.
   Coincidentally, his freedom came on the opening day of the
Goodwill Games, which have drawn hundreds of Soviet athletes to
Seattle and brought more than 1,000 Soviet citizens for ``home
stay'' visits with Americans. In all, the Goodwill Games have drawn
some 2,500 athletes from 50 countries.
   Vetkovskij was aboard the Czechoslovakian merchant ship M-S
Tatry when it docked June 14 in New Orleans, and he went ashore
with a landing pass good for 29 days.
   He had been to the United States before for three-day stints but
wanted more. In his broken English, he explained: ``Many times
visit America but it's very little time. It's very good when every
people can be every one, two, three months here.''
   The ship set sail the next day, but the 29-year-old native of
Peno, near Leningrad, set off across the United States. He
hitchhiked to San Diego and ended up in Seattle on June 24.
   He decided to look for a job in the city's port and found one on
a ship. The skipper told him he needed to go to the INS to get the
proper papers.
   But the captain of the Czech ship had reported Vetkovskij
missing, which invalidated his papers, and when he walked into the
INS building he was arrested as an illegal alien.
   Later, Nick was to describe the INS detention center as a
``retirement home'' compared with the Soviet jail in which he said
he spent 10 days for his refusal to take part in the Soviet
occupation of Afghanistan.
   Nick was in the center for three weeks before marine engineer
Eric Bergh, whom Nick had met while job-hunting, decided to see
what had happened to his acquaintance.
   When he found out, Bergh contacted his sister, Kathryn Sterbick.
On Wednesday, she got immigration lawyer Dan Danilov to take the
case. Sterbick, whose Norwegian-immigrant family is full of
sailors, met Nick and agreed to put him up in her Tacoma home until
his immigration status is resolved.
   ``Seamen are brothers _ it's a law of the open sea,'' Sterbick
explained. ``He's a warm and friendly young man and he reminds me a
lot of my brothers.''
   At a hearing Thursday, Danilov got bail lowered from $5,000 to
$4,000, and by Friday afternoon had raised enough in contributions
to post bail.
   Vetkovskij waved his arms and clenched his fists in victory
outside the INS detention center while remaining detainees cheered
from the second floor windows.
   ``Hey! Tomorrow we meet again!'' he shouted.
   Danilov said Vetkovskij will decide over the next few days
whether to seek political asylum. A deportation hearing is set for
July 27 but Danilov said he will ask for a three- or four-week
delay to give him time to prepare.
   With the hearings and delays, Nick might be able to stay long
enough to satisfy his curiosity.

<HEAD>Brennan's Retirement Likely to Aid Court's Conservative March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice William J. Brennan is leaving behind a
Supreme Court legacy of commitment to individual rights and
fairness, and his departure is likely to lead to a more
conservative court, legal scholars said Saturday.
   Brennan, 84, announced Friday that he is leaving the court after
nearly 34 years because of failing health and advancing age. His
tenure spanned the administrations of eight presidents, and in
recent years he has been a roadblock in a conservative march by the
deeply divided justices.
   Scholars agreed President Bush's choice to succeed him
inevitably will help take the court further to the right on the
most divisive social issues of the day _ abortion rights,
affirmative action, school prayer and the separation of church and
state.
   ``He will be replaced by a justice surely more inclined to
augment the state's power to regulate abortions, more accommodating
of religion and more dubious of affirmative action,'' said
University of Virginia law professor A.E. Dick Howard.
   Bruce Fein, a conservative court analyst, predicted the court
will become ``a conservative juggernaut.''
   Brennan ``was the intellectual glue,'' Fein said. ``The
remaining liberals will be dispirited. They just don't have that
strength and winsome character to bring up that fifth vote ... and
keep their cherished rulings intact.''
   But court watchers also said some of Brennan's major
accomplishments will survive regardless of his successor.
   Robert Bennett, dean of Northwestern University's law school,
said what is ``most impressive is the enduring aspects of Brennan's
work. Some of those principles are almost unassailable.''
   Bennett cited opinions Brennan authored that established the
equal voting standard of ``one person, one vote'' and that gave the
news media broad constitutional protection against libel suits by
public figures.
   ``What Justice Brennan succeeded in doing was fashioning a body
of jurisprudence that relied on fairness, equality and human
decency,'' said Howard. ``The appeal of principles of that kind is
lasting. He succeeded, I think, in distilling some of the better
instincts of modern American life.''
   Some of Brennan's more recent pronouncements on freedom of
speech also might endure.
   Brennan wrote for the court last month when it struck down a
federal law against flag burning. In a 5-4 ruling, Brennan said,
``The government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply
because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.''
   Two of the court's most conservative members, Justices Antonin
Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, were in the majority.
   Some legal scholars said that suggests that another conservative
appointee by Bush also might side with liberals on free-speech
issues.
   When Kennedy joined the court in 1988, he solidified a 5-4
conservative majority. He was the third justice to be picked by
President Reagan, who also promoted William H. Rehnquist to chief
justice.
   But liberals, led by Brennan, have managed to win important
victories in key cases by attracting a normally conservative
justice.
   For example, at the conclusion of its 1989-90 term last month,
Brennan authored the court's 5-4 opinion upholding the federal
government's broad power to grant preferential treatment to
minorities.
   Scholars agree that Brennan's departure means more than a loss
of a key liberal vote.
   The University of Virginia's Howard said Brennan combined
unmatched experience and expertise, formidable intellectual skills
and amiable personal qualities.
   ``No one hates Justice Brennan,'' Howard said. ``No one will
fill those shoes.''
   Brennan is a diminutive man whose physical stature and
irresistible Irish charm remind some of a leprechaun.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, labeled a conservative when he joined
the court but in recent years a reliable Brennan ally, has paid
tribute to his colleague's peruasiveness and savvy.
   Blackmun has recalled how Brennan came up to him one day in a
corridor in the court building, threw his arm around Blackmun and
said, ``Harry, us liberals have to stick together.''
   The most closely watched battleground between conservatives and
liberals continues to be abortion rights.
   There appear to be four votes to overturn the court's 1973
ruling in Roe vs. Wade that established a constitutional right to
an abortion.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the only woman ever to serve on the
court, has provided a fifth vote to give states new power to
regulate abortions but has stopped short of voting to overturn the
1973 ruling.
   Activists on both sides of the abortion debate expect Bush to
name someone who will provide the pivotal vote to reverse Roe vs.
Wade.
   ``Unless there is a massive and unprecedented political
mobilization, Justice Brennan's departure may be a death knell for
the right to choose in America,'' said Kate Michelman, head of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``Justice Brennan's resignation shakes the so-called abortion
rights to its very foundation,'' said Joseph M. Scheidler, director
of the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League. ``After 17 years, the
court that invented a woman's right to destroy new life is rapidly
disappearing. A new court is emerging.''

<HEAD>USS New Jersey Readied For Decommissioning, Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the Navy's four battleships,
the USS New Jersey, is being stripped and readied for
decommissioning, the fourth time in its 47-year history.
   There were no bands, no pomp and circumstance and no admirals as
the vessel, sporting menacing 16-inch guns and 17-inch armor,
pulled up to Pier 6 at the Long Beach Naval Station on Friday.
   Its last journey was a brief one, running 45 minutes from Seal
Beach where its crew unloaded ammunition.
   ``This is just another day in the life of the battleship,'' said
the dreadnought's skipper, Capt. Ronald D. Tucker.
   Maybe. The New Jersey was recommissioned four times since it was
launched Dec. 7, 1942, a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor brought the United States into World War II.
   At a cost of $435 million, it was last recommissioned on Dec.
28, 1982, under former President Reagan's plans for a 600-ship
Navy. The New Jersey's latest tour of duty included firing salvos
at Syrian anti-aircraft batteries in the mountains of Lebanon in
December 1983.
   But the ship cost more than $35 million a year to maintain,
making it a dead-in-the-water target for congressional
budget-cutters. Only three other battleships, the Iowa, the
Missouri and the Wisconsin, exist.
   On Friday, its 1,500-man crew began preparing the 887-foot-long
battleship for decommissioning in February. In March, the ship will
be towed to join its sister ship, the USS Iowa, with the Navy's
mothballed reserve fleet off Bremerton, Wash.
   In the Pacific Theater during World War II, its operations
covered the Marshall Islands, New Guinea, the Marianas, Leyte,
Luzon, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The ship also saw action in the Korean
and Vietnam wars.

<TEXT>
   At an age when the only form most
youngsters see is a report card, three boys tired of finding
garbage and sewage in their neighborhood creek have filed a
complaint with county authorities.
   ``If we don't do something, who will?'' said 12-year-old Phillip
Wortman.
   He and his 11-year-old brother, Rollin, and 12-year-old friend
Steve Ryals filed a formal complaint with the Tulsa County Health
Department in an effort to end trash and sewage dumping.
   ``We're talking about a life and death matter,'' Ryals said.
``Look at this. It's really polluted. Not too long ago, I got in
the water and a rash immediately broke out on my skin.''
   The 3-foot-wide creek is scattered with trash and junk, which is
piled as much as 5 feet high on one bank. Everything from garbage
and appliance parts to tires clutter the creek.
   In addition, there are plumbing pipes that protrude from the
earth behind a couple of nearby homes. The boys claim the pipes
occasionally discharge a smelly liquid into the creek, located in a
suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of Tulsa.
   The Health Department began investigating the boys' complaint
Friday, said department spokesman David Haynes. It's the first time
he knows of that children have filed a pollution complaint, he said.
   The trio ``seem very serious about the condition of the area,''
Haynes said. Dumping trash and sewage is illegal but not uncommon,
he added.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Young's lackluster performance in last
week's Georgia gubernatorial primary underscored the uphill battle
black candidates are having as they seek some of the highest
political posts in the South.
   After slowly gaining a presence in local and state government,
blacks are making unprecedented runs for office in a region once
known for racial discrimination.
   Though he failed to place first, Young has made it to an Aug. 7
runoff for the Democratic nomination for governor. Two other blacks
are trying to win top elections elsewhere in the South.
   In North Carolina, Harvey Gantt is the Democratic nominee trying
to unseat Republican Sen. Jesse Helms; in South Carolina, state
Sen. Theo Mitchell has won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
   But Young, Gantt and Mitchell each are running against strong
candidates, as well as a history that says voters in the
predominantly white states generally cast ballots along racial
lines.
   Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman, U.N. ambassador and
civil rights movement veteran, finished 12 percentage points on
Tuesday behind the front-runner _ Zell Miller, a four-term
lieutenant governor.
   Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., is up against Helms,
a nationally known incumbent who has been in office 18 years.
Mitchell, a state senator from Greenville, S.C., is challenging
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell, a popular incumbent with strong
ties to the Bush administration.
   Despite numerous differences between the three candidates, their
opponents and their states, the three are bound by more than just
the physical fact that they're black, said David Ruffin of the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black-oriented
think tank in Washington.
   ``All these candidates are using politics to renegotiate the
compact between society and blacks,'' said Ruffin, who edits the
center's Focus magazine. ``All of them are looking for change. The
big difference is in the conditions in which they're running.''
   The nation has no black senators and one black governor,
Virginia's L. Douglas Wilder, who was elected last year.
   Since winning the Democratic runoff in North Carolina in June,
Gantt has been on the road meeting voters, trying to offset the
financial advantage held by Helms, an archconservative who some
consider politically vulnerable this year.
   ``We think what we're doing is building support that is deep and
won't be swayed by Helms' 30-second (television) barrages,'' said
Susan Jetton, Gantt's press secretary.
   Ms. Jetton said the Gantt campaign is finding plenty of
anti-Helms sentiment across the state.
   ``He will have plenty of money and help in running against
Helms,'' said Earl Black, a political science professor at the
University of South Carolina. ``There is so much opposition to
Helms that any Democratic candidate can expect good financing.''
   But even some black supporters of Gantt aren't counting out
Helms.
   Tyrone Brooks, a black Georgia state legislator who supports
Gantt, said he was nonetheless skeptical about Gantt's chances in
the North Carolina election.
   Brooks was asked about the North Carolinian earlier this month
during a federal court hearing on a so-far-unsuccessful suit
challenging the runoff provision of Georgia's election law. He
testified that Gantt's runoff victory was an ``aberration'' and not
representative of the climate for black candidates in Southern
statewide elections.
   ``You can't say that because Mr. Gantt won in North Carolina,
that we're going to win every runoff,'' Brooks said.
   Many political observers said the second-place finish in the
Georgia primary was a disappointment for Young, who was well known
and ran as a moderate stressing his talent for attracting business
investment.
   But Young failed to win strong white support, and urban blacks
failed to give him the overwhelming backing he counted on.
   Young said the morning after the primary vote was counted that
he was unsure why the black vote was smaller than he wanted.
   Mitchell, on the other hand, attracted a sizable black vote in
the Democratic primary and has been campaigning regularly at black
churches, said Black.
   Mitchell soundly defeated state Sen. Ernest Passailaigue, a
white, in the Democratic primary, earning 60 percent of the vote.
Election officials said voter turnout was low overall but that
Mitchell was helped by the high black turnout. He remains the
underdog in the general election campaign, however.
   Keith R. Billingsley, an associate professor of political
science at the University of Georgia, said Young's success with
black voters may have been reduced because his two terms as mayor
of predominantly black Atlanta were not an unqualified success
among the city's residents.
   ``A number of black folks have told me they did not respect the
way he ran the city, especially the police department,''
Billingsley said.
   Race has not emerged as an overt issue in any of the campaigns,
though there is a definite racial undercurrent, said Billingsley.
   Young and Miller each have promised that the candidates' records
will be the issue in their runoff campaign.
   ``They're going to talk about it (the record), and the voters
are going to look at their color,'' Billingsley said.

   The Cecil B. DeMille Trust has
contributed $1 million to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences' Center for Motion Picture Study.
   The donation was made by trustees Cecilia DeMille Presley, Peter
DeMille Calvin and Joseph W. Harper, the grandchildren of the
famous filmmaker.
   ``It seems absolutely right to us that a film maker of the
stature of C.B. DeMille is being honored in this way,'' actor Karl
Malden, the academy's president, said Friday.
   ``We're pleased and grateful that his grandchildren have made
this important contribution to ensuring the future of this vital
cultural resource,'' Malden said.
   DeMille was a founding member of the Academy and served on its
Board of Governors from 1934 to 1940. Among his films were ``The
Greatest Show on Earth,'' ``The Ten Commandments'' and ``The Squaw
Man.''
   He died in 1959.
   The center is currently under renovation and is scheduled to
reopen Nov. 12. The DeMille gift brings the center's endowment
campaign to nearly 40 percent of a $15 million goal.

   Bari spoke about the bombing in Oakland and about what she
considers an earlier attempt to kill her in an interview Thursday
with The Associated Press at the rehabilitation center where she is
undergoing therapy.
   She said that when a logging truck once ran her off a road, ``I
was able to reach inside of myself and find the courage to go on.
But this time I didn't have anything left. It was the support of
the movement that enabled me to go on.''
   Supporters suspect the bomb that injured Bari and passenger
Darryl Cherney was planted by timber interests in retaliation for
their roles organizing Redwood Summer, a series of protests against
the logging of old-growth redwood forests.
   Bari said she had received several written death threats.
   She said she is kept awake nights by severe pain and fear that
whoever planted the bomb might strike again.
   But most frustrating, she said, was that authorities suspected
her and Cherney in the bombing. They were arrested for
investigation of explosives possession and transportation because
police suspected they were carrying a bomb that went off
accidentally.
   ``I feel persecuted by the police. I don't feel protected by the
police,'' Bari said. ``I'm the victim of a horrible crime, and I
think I'm in a position where I need the police to protect me and
find who did it.
   ``They have not for one minute dropped their view of me as a
criminal simply because of my political views.''
   Bari and her supporters felt vindicated last week when
prosecutors said they would file no charges against the pair _ for
the time being at least. But investigators insist no one has been
exonerated and that their investigation of the explosion is
continuing.
   Investigators have been hampered by the refusal of some Earth
First! supporters to cooperate, said Oakland police Lt. Mike Sims.
   ``People who may support Bari and Cherney's side of the story
have been directed by attorneys to refuse to talk to us,'' he said.
   Bari has a simple response.
   ``As long as they are presuming me guilty, then we are foolish
to cooperate with them,'' she said.
   At issue: the tactics favored by some Earth First! members,
including ``monkey-wrenching'' _ acts of sabotage against those
who, they feel, are damaging the environment.
   Such sabotage has included tree spiking _ driving large nails
into trees, which can damage power saws and risk injury to timber
and mill workers. Earth First! activists also have chained
themselves to tree-cutting machines, blocked logging roads and
occupied road-building equipment.
   But members say the group takes no official stance on such
activity and that its members are mostly involved in acts of civil
disobedience.
   Bari herself has rejected the use of sabotage, although she does
not condemn all of it.
   The bombing has helped change the movement to save the redwood
forests, she believes.
   ``Obviously, it has galvanized a lot of attention,'' she said.
``But on the other hand it knocked out the experienced leadership.
So I think it had both a negative and a positive effect.''
   Although more moderate environmental groups have joined Earth
First! in calling for an independent investigation of the bombing,
most have not spoken out in favor of the Earth First! movement
itself.
   Bari is pleased by reports of anti-logging protests, although
none of the protests yet this summer has attracted the many
thousands of people organizers boasted would flock to the region.
   Bari wonders when she'll be well enough to take an active role
in the movement.
   ``I've been really terrified to the depths of my soul,'' she
said, but added:
   ``My brain is still functioning.''

<HEAD>Air Force Says Two B-2s May Be Delayed; Aspin To Urge Program
Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has told Congress it needs
another $1.4 billion to acquire two B-2 bombers on schedule, an
admission bound to further erode congressional support for the
radar-evading aircraft.
   Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice notified House Armed Services
Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., of the budget shortfall in a letter
obtained by The Associated Press over the weekend. It came on the
eve of a speech Monday by Aspin in which, congressional sources
say, he will propose canceling the B-2 program entirely.
   Aspin, who kept the increasingly expensive plane alive with
compromise legislation last year, has been moving towards halting
funds for the program because of its high cost, which has
skyrocketed to about $860 million each.
   The pricetag may surpass the $1 billion mark based on the latest
revelations.
   Proponents of House legislation to limit the program to the
planes currently in production say they are a handful of votes
short of the number needed for approval.
   But the plane still has staunch support in the Senate, where the
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
is a key proponent.
   Rice, in his letter dated July 11, said that without the $1.4
billion, acquisition of the two bombers will have to be delayed
until 1997. The two B-2s are among 15 bombers intended to be bought
through 1990 at a cost of $27 billion. The Air Force had begun
procurement of the two planes in 1988 and 1989.
   Rice also said that the cost of buying two other B-2s and
related items in the 1991 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 will total
$4.6 billion, an increase of about $500 million from the original
figure.
   Rice blamed the increase in costs primarily on a jump in
overhead charges and changes in the production rate.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, facing economic pressure and a
lessening Soviet threat, in April revised plans for the B-2,
cutting the total number of aircraft planned from 132 to 75 and the
1990 budget request from five to two.
   Rice said Cheney's revision pushed the shortfall to an estimated
$1.4 billion.
   This shortfall ``will become a liability when the contracts''
are signed and executed, Rice said in the letter. Initialing of the
contracts is expected in December 1990 and the summer of 1991.
   The Air Force examined several options to make up the shortfall,
including using unobligated money from past years or supplemental
appropriations. The service has decided to restructure the previous
year's purchases of 15 planes.
   ``This restructure would involve moving two aircraft to fiscal
1997, one from fiscal 1988 ... and one from fiscal 1989,'' Rice
said.
   Thus, instead of the Air Force's current plans for 15 planes to
be bought through 1990 at a cost of about $27 billion, the Air
Force would be left with 13 planes.
   Rice said the B-2 is ``not unique to this type of shortfall as
program costs react to changes in quantity or schedule.''

   A man has been sentenced to a year in jail _ for
breaking into jail.
   ``It's the first time I've ever had where somebody was trying to
break into jail,'' Assistant District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal said.
   David Matthew Winfree, 22, pleaded guilty to burglary for
breaking into the Municipal Prison Farm and was sentenced Friday to
a year in the Harris County Jail.
   Winfree, a landscaper, was apprehended inside a maintenance
building Thursday with a $270 battery charger. He told police he
was looking for landscaping tools to steal, said Rosenthal.
   ``It's gotten to the point that the judicial system has made it
so attractive for criminals that criminals ask us for prison time
instead of probation,'' said State District Judge Michael McSpadden.
   ``But we've hit an all-time low when they start knocking down
doors to get into prison.''
   McSpadden referred to recent incidents where people have asked
for prison time instead of probation because they expected to be
out of prison quickly, without the inconvenience of being on
probation. The state's overcrowded prison system has forced
authorities to release many inmates early.

Saturday drowned a day earlier as he sought relief from heat in a
section of river posted as dangerous.
   Steve Ensey, 25, of Bakersfield, along with his cousin, Jim Cook
of Los Angeles, disappeared Friday after they slid down a rock into
a section of rapids on the swift Kern River. Ensey's best man, Mark
Fisher, called authorities and divers recovered the victims'
bodies, said Kern County Senior Deputy Jim Johnson.
   He said the area, three miles from the mouth of Kern River
Canyon, is considered dangerous and is posted as such. However,
even while divers looked for the drowning victims, other people
continued swimming nearby to escape 100-degree heat, he said.
   More than 150 people have drowned in that stretch of the Kern

<HEAD>Geography, Lifestyle Make Boulder Attractive To Traffickers,
Authorities Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boulder's two most attractive features _
its laid-back lifestyle and rugged geography _ also help attract
drug traffickers who use it as a base, law enforcement and city
officials say.
   Federal grand juries in Denver last week indicted 12 men
allegedly involved in two separate marijuana smuggling rings based
in Boulder.
   One of the operations is believed to be the biggest ever to
operate in Colorado, smuggling an estimated 100,000 pounds of pot
into this country from Mexico from 1978 to 1988.
   ``There obviously is an attraction to the area,'' said police
Sgt. Joe Pelle. ``I think there are several reasons why Boulder is
popular. It is secluded and affluent.''
   ``The feds tell me the majority of cases they have in Colorado
have Boulder ties,'' Pelle said.
   Pelle noted that only a small fraction of the marijuana imported
into Boulder is actually distributed in the Boulder-Denver area.
   Boulder, snuggled against the Flatiron Mountains, is a city of
about 80,000 and is home of the University of Colorado. Pelle and
other officials said they do not believe Boulder has any higher
proportion of drug users than other college towns.
   One indictment named six men who allegedly ran the state's
largest marijuana trafficking operation. That indictment resulted
from a two-year investigation initiated when a maid discovered
$42,000 while cleaning a motel room in Boulder.
   About $10 million worth of cash, gold, artworks, rare coins and
other valuables have been impounded from members of the group, and
federal authorities are seeking the forfeiture of a total of $50
million in assets, officials said.
   Four members of that group are in custody.
   In the other Boulder drug case that came to light last week, six
other men were accused of smuggling 10,000 pounds of pot into the
city from Mexico from 1986 to 1989. All six were arrested.
   The alleged ringleader of this group was nicknamed the champagne
smuggler. The group apparently marked dates and load sizes on
champagne corks to record their ventures.
   Boulder Mayor Leslie Durgin said she is not sure Boulder has any
more drug operations than other cities, but cited many lifestyle
characteristics of the community in explaining why it tends to be a
base for smuggling operations.
   ``There is a willingness of people in Boulder to be tolerant. We
give people quite a bit of room in their own lives,'' she said.
``That's something we're proud of in Boulder, the tolerance of
diversity and the space given in individual lives.''
   Robert Pence, head of the Denver FBI office, noted that the
relative affluence of Boulder allows drug traffickers to live a
comfortable lifestyle without drawing attention to themselves.
   ``It's not that Boulder has a corner on the market, they're all
over, but the city has been popular with what I would call the
yuppie-type drug traffickers,'' he said.
   Pence said Boulder's geography also makes it hospitable to drug
smugglers. Because it is near the mountains the operators can find
relatively secluded houses and still be close to Boulder and to
Denver, 30 miles away.
   Boulder also has easy access to interstate highways and has
three small airports nearby, and its central location in the United
States makes it an ideal distribution center, said Pence.
   Pence said Boulder's liberal politics and its reputation as a
fun place to live also tend to attract drug operators.
   ``It has a lifestyle they're comfortable with,'' he said.

   The Baltic republics on Saturday quietly marked
what Lithuania called ``a day of injury, humiliation and tragedy,''
the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Soviet power over them.
   Flags flew at half-staff in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius,
and Latvia announced its lawmakers had voted to nullify the 1940
declaration of Soviet power.
   For decades, July 21 had been celebrated officially as a holiday
in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But the three Baltic republics in
the last year have expanded their sovereignty and announced their
intention to break with the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania's prime minister was quoted Saturday as saying that
negotiations with Soviet officials on the republic's March 11
declaration of independence could start next week.
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were independent of Moscow briefly
between the two world wars. But under a secret agreement Stalin and
Hitler signed in 1939, they fell into the Soviet sphere of
influence.
   Soviet soldiers moved in as Nazi forces attacked Poland, and
under Soviet pressure the parliaments of the three republics voted
to join the Soviet Union.
   They were admitted as Soviet republics in early August of 1940.
Thousands of Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians were killed, sent
into exile or prison.
   The Latvian Supreme Soviet parliament voted Thursday to void the
50-year-old declaration of Soviet power, Aris Yansons, an assistant
to Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov, said Saturday. The
proclamation strengthened the parliament's condemnation of the act
in February.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass quoted a Latvian government
statement Saturday as saying July 21, 1940, marked the start of
``mass terror and genocide against the residents of Latvia, the
consequences of which are still being felt.''
   Lithuania's government said in a statement Saturday that ``the
21st of July remains a day of injury, humiliation and tragedy in
our memory.''
   Aidas Palubinskas, a spokesman for the Lithuanian Supreme
Council parliament, said flags were flying at half-mast at the
parliament building and a few other locations in Vilnius.
   He said supporters of Soviet power held a small rally in a city
park, but the day otherwise was quiet. A small rally was also held
Friday in Tallinn, Estonia, but the anniversary itself was ``a
typical Saturday,'' said an editor at official Estonian Radio.
   The Soviet Union's main newspapers carried long articles
Saturday backing the Kremlin position by depicting the Baltics'
absorption into the country as voluntary. They also published a
call by national parliamentary leaders for ``responsibility and
common sense.''
   The small Communist Party faction in Lithuania that has remained
loyal to Moscow also issued a statement saying the republic joined
the Soviet Union voluntarily, the party daily Pravda reported.
   Meanwhile, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimeira Prunskiene said
in an interview published Saturday that the republic could start
negotiations next week with Soviet officials, ``and the Soviet side
is ready for this.''
   ``I would say that our dialogue now is taking place in a very
calm tone,'' she told the Interfax news service, which is
affiliated with official Radio Moscow.
   Lithuania agreed on June 29 to put a 100-day moratorium on its
declaration of independence, starting when negotiations formally
begin with Soviet officials.
   The Kremlin then halted an economic embargo that had shut off
oil shipments, most natural gas and many other goods and raw
materials.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she and another Lithuanian official, Bronus
Kuzmickas, had a ``short and concrete'' conversation with Gorbachev
on Friday after a joint meeting of the Presidential and Federation
councils to discuss economic reform and a new treaty between Moscow
and the Soviet republics.
   She said both sides expressed the desire ``to start
negotiations, and strive for a convergence of positions in order to
sign an agreement.''

   President Bush took his campaign
against big defense cuts to one of the nation's few remaining
shipyards Saturday, saying the United States must retain a strong
military despite the apparent demise of the Cold War.
   ``While freedom has made great gains, we have not entered an era
of perpetual peace,'' Bush said at a christening ceremony for the
nation's newest aircraft carrier, the George Washington.
   Standing in a shadow of the carrier's massive bow, Bush quoted
the nation's first president: ```To be prepared for war is one of
the most effective means of preserving the peace.'''
   The message contrasted with Bush's recent attempts to persuade
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the United States poses
no military threat.
   After the 40-minute ceremony the president flew from nearby
Langley Air Force Base to his mountain retreat at Camp David, Md.
   The visit to Newport News was Bush's second defense-related trip
in as many days. On Friday he traveled to Warren Air Force Base
near Cheyenne, Wyo., where all 50 of the nation's MX
intercontinental ballistic missiles are stationed in silos.
   The focus on defense coincides with growing debate in Congress
over how deeply and quickly military spending should be reduced as
a result of the collapse of the Soviet threat in Europe and the
spawning of democracies in the East bloc.
   Speaking at the Newport News Shipbuilding yard, Bush made no
mention of the budget debate on Capitol Hill. At Warren on Friday,
however, the president said he was willing to accept a Senate Armed
Services Committee proposal for a $289 billion defense budget for
the coming fiscal year.
   Bush said Congress must ``hold the line'' at the Senate panel's
spending figure and that he needed greater flexibility in pruning
the size of the armed forces. The Senate panel called for cutting
100,000 personnel from the total armed services of 2.1 million.
That is nearly three times the number Bush has proposed dropping.
   In his February budget request, Bush asked Congress to hold
defense spending to $307 billion. As recently as last week Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said the administration was not ready to
abandon its proposal.
   With the Navy's top officers at his side during the carrier
christening ceremony, Bush said the United States must sustain a
superpower military strength.
   ``We must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed
forces sufficient to sustain our vital national interest,'' he
said. ``We are ... the pivotal factor of stability. We will not
shrink from this responsibility.''
   Barbara Bush, with the president and their daughter Dorothy
LeBlond at her side, performed the formal christening of the
1,040-foot carrier. She stood on a platform directly beneath the
ship's bow and smashed a bottle of champagne against the hull.
   For the occasion Bush, a former Navy pilot who flew combat
missions from a Pacific-based carrier during World War II, wore a
navy blue tie adorned with aviator wings.
   Bush praised the Newport News shipbuilders, noting that the yard
constructed the nation's first carrier, the Ranger, in 1934 and
that it had produced 239 others since then.
   ``Few realize the magnitude of your task _ what it means to
build a state-of-the-art supercarrier: a warship, a floating city,
and an airport, all rolled into one,'' Bush said.
   The $3.1 billion George Washington is due to enter service in
1992. It is the sixth Nimitz-class carrier to be built; two more
are in development. In all, the Navy has 15 active carriers,
including one in overhaul.

   Thousands of protesters clashed
Saturday with riot police after a huge anti-government rally that
drew together South Korea's splintered opposition and attracted
about 300,000 people.
   Also Saturday, President Roh Tae-woo said South Korea is willing
to negotiate conditions set by North Korea before it will consider
allowing unrestricted travel between the rival nations.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries in Seoul.
The anti-government rally at a park in the southern part of the
city was the first since Roh's election in 1987 in which the
spectrum of opposition groups joined forces.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' protesters screamed as they poured
into the streets after the rally.
   The clash broke out as riot police blocked a column of about
20,000 radical students at a bridge leading toward the center of
the capital. The demonstrators ripped up sidewalks and threw chunks
of concrete at police, who fired tear gas during the hour-long
battle.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, an opposition stronghold,
police firing tear gas stormed Chonnam University to break up an
anti-government rally by about 1,000 students and dissidents, news
reports said. There were no reports of arrests or injuries.
   At the Seoul rally, thousands of laborers, housewives, students
with red headbands and men in business suits cheered as opposition
speakers demanded new general elections.
   The speakers called for a common front against the Roh
government, which they claimed has lost public confidence.
   ``Let's strike while the iron's hot,'' said Kim Dae-jung, head
of the leading Party for Peace and Democracy. ``We must form a new
National Assembly and hold new general elections.''
   Six huge air balloons floated overhead, lowering streamers
emblazoned with anti-government slogans such as ``Crush Roh
Tae-woo!'' Radical students used red paint to daub anti-government
slogans on park roads.
   ``Unification of all opposition forces is a call of the era,''
said Lee Ki-taek, head of the splinter opposition group, the
Democratic Party. ``Let's make this moment the beginning of a new
march for democracy.''
   The rally came a day after the nation's two opposition parties,
led by Kim and Lee, agreed to merge into a new unified party, to be
joined by other dissidents. They promised to finish the merger
before September.
   If successful, it would be the first unified opposition party in
Korean history. South Korea's opposition, always divided, has never
posed a serious threat to the government.
   The push for the merger intensified after all 78 opposition
lawmakers in the 299-member National Assembly pledged to resign
this week to protest the pushing through parliament of several
controversial bills, including one aimed at reshaping the nation's
broadcast industry.
   On the border-opening issue, the latest round of discussion
began Friday, when Roh proposed the opening of the heavily
fortified boundary on a trial basis in August.
   Although North Korea immediately denounced Roh's free travel
proposal, Roh told a Cabinet meeting Saturday that Seoul ``must
continue ... efforts to achieve the goal, and we can actively
discuss points of contention with them.''
   To prepare for free travel, North Korea said South Korea should
first demolish ``concrete walls'' allegedly built along the border,
repeal security laws banning pro-North Korean activity and release
people jailed for violating such laws.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist north and
the capitalist south at the end of World War II. The nations'
border is tightly sealed and guarded by more than 1.5 million
troops. There is no mail or telephone service between the countries.

   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan
Quayle, underwent gynecological surgery Saturday following a test
primarily used to detect cancer and was ``recovering well,'' her
spokesman said.
   Although press secretary David Beckwith disclosed neither the
specific reason for the surgery nor the hospital where it was
performed, he said Mrs. Quayle's ``disease'' was diagnosed early
with a Pap test.
   ``The Quayle family is thankful that this test was able to
detect her disease at its earliest stages,'' Beckwith said, reading
from a prepared statement. He would not elaborate.
   The spokesman said she ``is recovering well following surgery
this morning. Mrs. Quayle will be able to resume her full schedule
in four to six weeks. Full and total recovery is expected.''
   A Pap test can help detect 25 to 30 possible medical problems,
but its primary purpose is to screen for malignancies and
pre-malignancies in the reproductive tract, said Dr. Allan B.
Weingold, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the George
Washington University Medical Center.
   Weingold, who has no personal knowledge of Mrs. Quayle's
condition, said of the 25 to 30 possible diagnoses, 15 to 20 could
be for malignancies or pre-malignancies. The rest could be for
infections and hormonal changes.
   Mrs. Quayle turns 41 a week from Sunday. Friends had given her a
surprise party on Friday at a skating rink in a Virginia suburb of
Washington.
   Other than a sprained ankle she suffered a year ago, this is the
first reported health problem for Mrs. Quayle. Her mother, Mary
Tucker, died of breast cancer in 1975 at the age of 56.

   A conservative research organization is trying
to convince the nation's press that it is biased.
   The Media Research Center has mailed out to newspapers and other
opinion-makers 8,000 copies of a report that uses hundreds of
examples to make the case that the media ``serve as a cheerleader''
for liberal causes.
   The booklength report, ``And That's the Way It Isn't,'' pictures
a national press corps composed of liberals who surround themselves
with like-minded friends and colleagues to the point they are
oblivious to what mainstream American thinks.
   And, it says, these journalists are blind to their own tendency
to give a liberal spin to the news.
   ``Their friends are liberals, their sources are liberals, what
they read and hear is written by liberals,'' it says. ``This helps
explain why policies considered `liberal' by the public are seen as
`mainstream' by reporters and editors.''
   The center describes itself as ``a conservative media
foundation.''
   Brent Baker, executive director and the book's co-editor, said
copies have been mailed to college professors and libraries,
politicians, think tanks and news bureaus in Washington, and to
radio talk show hosts, editorial writers and political editors
across the country.
   He said the conservative William H. Donner Foundation is
furnishing between $50,000 and $100,000 to help pay for the
project. The rest of the money comes from the center's own
finances, provided by gifts of $1,000 to $25,000 a year from
several hundred supporters.
   The book is a compilation of more than 40 studies that, taken
together, says Baker, are ``hard to dismiss as an aberration.''
   Most of the studies cite examples drawn from ``big media'' _ The
New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the
papers of the Gannett Co., which publishes USA Today, Time, The
Associated Press, United Press International, the American
Broadcasting Co., National Broadcasting Co., Columbia Broadcasting
System, Public Broadcasting System, and Cable News Network.
   Researcher Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, author of
three books about the Washington press and of a study cited in the
report, takes issue with the report.
   He said the press ``has become increasingly professional'' and
lives up to a set of standards ``which work as a brake against
their personal bias and inclination.''
   The nation's agenda is set not by the press, but by the
politicians, candidates and businessmen who hold the news
conferences, issue the reports and conduct the hearings that the
media report on.
   Conceding that the media were unable to prevent the election or
re-election of Ronald Reagan, the report said, ``No, they don't win
every time, but they do win most of the time,'' it says.
   The report cites:
   _Surveys of the political attitudes of journalists. It says they
consistently show they're more liberal than the public.
   _Studies of what journalists did in other careers. It contends
that most who move from the political world into journalism come
from liberal quarters.
   _Compilations of quotes from journalists ``in unguarded
moments'' that show their true colors. As an example the report
cites a quote from ABC newsman David Brinkley in the Washington
Post Magazine: ``If I had to pick the best presidents in my
lifetime, I would of course pick Roosevelt and Kennedy, and I would
also pick Harry Truman.''
   _Counts showing how often some terms such as
``ultraconservative'' and ``ultraliberal'' are used. It says they
show that ``conservatives were far more likely than liberals to be
painted as ideologues and extremists.''

   The introduction of Pizza Hut to Moscow
will also see the introduction of Margy Trcka from little
Coralville, Iowa, to her first taste of life in another country.
   Trcka, manager of the Coralville Pizza Hut, is part of a
five-member team leaving Aug. 1 to train 300 Soviets to make pizza
for the chain's next restaurants.
   ``I've never been overseas. It will be quite the adventure for
me,'' she said. ``It's kind of a mystery. I can picture myself
lying on the beach in Mexico, maybe, but I can't see myself in
Moscow.''
   When she learned last spring that she had been selected from
5,300 managers to make the trip, Trcka enrolled in an eight-week
language class at Kirkwood Community College.
   ``The thing I fear most is the language barrier. My favorite
phrase is going to be `I do not speak Russian,''' Trcka said. The
management team will train Soviet employees through interpreters.
   Pizza Hut, owned by Pepsico Inc., plans to open two restaurants
in Moscow by the end of August.
   One Pizza Hut will be in surburban Moscow and will seat 325
people. ``It's about five times the size of my little Coralville
Hut,'' Trcka said.
   The second will be near the recently opened McDonald's and will
seat about 80 people.
   It won't be the first time Muscovites have been exposed to
pizza. Two New Jerseyites, Louis Piancone Sr. of Newark and
Ukranian-born entrepreneur Shelley M. Zeiger of Moorestown, entered
a joint venture with Soviet officials in 1987 to take the company's
Astro Pizza mobile concession truck to Moscow. The truck began
selling to tourists and Soviet customers in April 1988.
   Trcka, along with managers from Florida, Illinois and New York,
will spend three weeks training the 300 workers selected to staff
the two Pizza Huts from about 6,000 applicants. In Coralville, a
suburb of Iowa City in eastern Iowa, Trcka oversees a crew of 25.
   ``I've heard the Soviet people are very friendly and really take
to Americans,'' she said. ``McDonald's broke some ground as far as
smiling and such. They're getting used to Western culture.''
   But while McDonald's emphasizes fast food, ``We're going to
concentrate more on service and family dining.''
   The restaurants will offer carryout service, ``a totally new
concept for the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Trcka said. ``If all goes well,
they'll consider delivery, too.''

   Palestinian guerrillas and
Syrian-supported Shiite militiamen stormed a Hezbollah mountain
stronghold Saturday and at least 30 people, most of them fighters,
were killed, police said.
   Seventy-two people were wounded in the fierce fighting in the
villages of Jarjou and Kfar Milki. The day's battles raised the
casualty toll in six days of fighting to at least 103 killed and
304 wounded.
   ``It's hand-to-hand fighting in Jarjou. The village square and
the streets are littered with bodies. Almost every building has
been shattered,'' said one security source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The fighting began Monday when the Islamic fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, attacked and seized Jarjou from the
Syrian-backed Amal militia in an effort to expand its area of
control toward the Mediterranean and open up a badly needed route
to Iran, its main supplier of arms.
   PLO fighters have been trying to stop the fighting between the
two Shiite groups, apparently to halt the Hezbollah advance toward
Sidon, a southern port where PLO guerrillas are based. It is 10
miles northwest of Jarjou.
   Amal and Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas fought a
three-year war between 1985 and 1988, but joined together to storm
the Hezbollah positions.
   Police said Saturday that about 300 Amal fighters and 250
Palestinians were ``nibbling their way'' into Jarjou on the
southwestern tip of Hezbollah's enclave.
   But a police spokesman said: ``Hezbollah is not withdrawing
despite the enormous pressure. The Hezbollahis are fighting tooth
and nail, fighting a battle to the last bullet and dying in place.''
   Both sides were reported moving in reinforcements and security
sources said the Palestinians and Amal were massing forces and
hauling in ammunition for an expected night assault.
   The Lebanese Red Cross appealed for urgent blood donations to
cope with the casualties.
   The Palestinians, mainly men from Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction,
and Amal militiamen launched their first attack on Jarjou at 3.a.m
behind a curtain of fire from multi-barrelled rocket launchers and
howitzers.
   They reached the village's main square by midday, police said.
   Hezbollah sent reinforcements from hills overlooking the village
and launched a counterattack around 1 p.m., but was beaten back,
the spokesman reported.
   Amal and Palestinian gunners shelled Jarjou's northern and
eastern edges in an apparent effort to try to cut it off from
Hezbollah reinforcements.
   The fundamentalists hammered the Palestinian-held southern part
of the village with phosphorous shells, the spokesman said.
   Reporters near the battle zone said the village was on fire,
with smoke billowing from almost every building.
   Hezbollah's radio station broadcast martial music. An announcer
declared: ``O Allah, shatter the criminals who are attacking your
men in Jarjou! O Allah, you will lead us to victory!''
   Hezbollah and Amal have been fighting off and on for three years
for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect.
   More than 1,100 people have been killed and some 3,400 wounded
in the inconclusive showdown between the Shiite rivals.
   The PLO has roughly 5,000 guerrillas in south Lebanon. Amal has
about 6,500 front-line fighters. Hezbollah can muster up about
2,000 Shiites, but has often defeated Amal in clashes.

<TEXT>
   Their policies are attacked from all
sides. They are losing cars and country homes. And now they have to
start paying their office telephone and electricity bills.
   For Communist officials in this ancient Russian city, these are
not the best of times. And they may be a sign of things to come for
other areas.
   Just ask Sergei Goryachev, the acting city party chief of Tver,
a Russian city 105 miles northwest of Moscow on the Volga River.
   Recently, he took a vacation, and had some time to think. What
he thought about was quitting the party.
   ``Of course there is worrying, serious worrying,'' said
Goryachev, the 38-year-old son of a soldier.
   In his office in Tver, an ancient city once called Kalinin, a
portrait of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin stares from the wall.
Looking at it, Goryachev summed up the result of his soul-searching.
   ``In this period, to leave would be pure betrayal,'' he said
simply.
   But dozens of party leaders have come to the opposite conclusion.
   Spurred by dissatisfaction with the outcome of this month's 28th
Communist Party Congress, loyalists are abandoning the party in
droves.
   The exodus began with maverick politician Boris N. Yeltsin and
has included other well-known figures: politicians, lawmakers, and
the mayors of Leningrad and Moscow.
   The party is under attack from the left for keeping a hand in
the KGB and army and police, and not sharing facilities including
buildings and printing presses with would-be competitors.
   The right is angry that the party loosened its grip on Eastern
European allies and is borrowing from capitalism in its economic
reforms.
   It is not known how many Communists nationwide have turned in
their party cards. But in the Tver region, 3,000 of the 150,000
members left the party in the first half of this year.
   Goryachev predicts more will quit. The unhappiness with the
party is apparent when he meets with workers, he said.
   ``They are cold in the very beginning when you walk in,'' he
said. ``But then, people see that you are the same as they, have
the same problems and that the problems concern me.''
   Many complaints, he said, are about privileges accorded party
officials. Goryachev and other officials say many summer cottages,
cars and medical facilities reserved for the party elite have been
turned over to the public.
   Tver's 53-year-old regional party chief, Alexander Ilyenkov,
acknowledges that hearing criticism is unpleasant. But nowadays, he
freely admits the party has made mistakes.
   ``Many of the misfortunes today were generated by me and I take
the responsibility,'' he tells the public.
   The party is taking responsibility in other ways as well.
   The phone and electricity bills of party offices at factories
have traditionally been paid by the host organizations, Goryachev
said. But to head off claims by prospective competing parties, such
bills will now be paid out of the party budget, he said.
   The local party's four city committees are being consolidated
into one, half of its 112 staff employees are to laid off and its
budget is to be cut by two-thirds.
   Since the party has given up its constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly of power, Tver's mayor, Sergei Kisilev, says he's ready to
act in the spirit of the times. Although no opposition parties have
officially registered in Tver, Kisilev says that if they do he will
``guarantee everyone equal conditions.''
   The government, he says, will no longer pay for the party's use
of the local TV station or non-party newspapers, and it will send a
bill to the party for meetings in theaters and other public
buildings.
   In keeping with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, Tver's party is
also separating itself from the government. Goryachev says Tver's
police chief used to call him regularly to report on crimes in the
city _ but no more. Party departments that supervised the local KGB
and other agencies are being abolished, he says.
   Ilyenkov believes the reforms will enable the party to win back
the people's hearts. But he says the process won't be easy.
   Changing the party, he says, isn't like going to the tailor,
where you simply step out ``in a renewed suit, discarding the old
one.''

   Under the U.S. system of separation of powers,
it is the president's job to choose Supreme Court nominees and the
Senate's role to confirm or reject them.
   After the president announces his choice, the appointment goes
to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducts hearings on the
nominee.
   The committee has the power to block the nomination, but given
the importance of the Supreme Court nominees, it's likely the
nomination will be forwarded to the full Senate.
   Twenty-seven high court nominees in the nation's history have
failed to win Senate confirmation, only seven in this century.
   Most recently, the Senate in 1987 blocked President Ronald
Reagan's appointment of Robert Bork to fill a vacancy created by
the retirement of Justice Lewis F. Powell.
   The Senate vote was 58-42, with six Republicans joining 52
Democrats in opposing Bork.
   Reagan's second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew after
revealing he had smoked marijuana. The Senate then confirmed
Reagan's third pick, Anthony M. Kennedy.

   Here is a brief description of the eight
remaining justices of the Supreme Court.
   William Rehnquist, 65, appointed to the court in 1971 by
President Richard Nixon and appointed chief justice by President
Ronald Reagan in 1986. Once a frequent dissenter, he now is
generally acknowledged as the leader of the court's working
conservative majority. Rehnquist is well liked by his colleagues,
who praise him for his informal, genial style.
   Byron R. White, 73, appointed to the court in 1962 by President
John Kennedy. White generally votes with the conservatives,
although his deference to federal power can produce some
contrasting results. He voted with the liberals last month to
uphold a key federal affirmative action program. He is among the
court's most avid questioners of lawyers during oral arguments and
can be abrasive.
   Thurgood Marshall, 82, appointed to the court in 1967 by
President Lyndon Johnson. Brennan's most consistent ally, Marshall
is the only black ever named to the court and is a figure of
historic importance in the civil rights movement. But critics say
his interest in court work has flagged in recent years. Marshall
has been an outspoken critic of Reagan and has vowed to remain on
the court as long as he is alive.
   Harry A. Blackmun, 81, appointed to the court in 1970 by Nixon.
He is best known as the author of the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade
that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
Once labeled a conservative ``twin'' of former Chief Justice Warren
E. Burger, he has cast generally liberal votes in recent years.
   John Paul Stevens, 70, appointed to the court in 1975 by
President Gerald Ford. He is a maverick whose intellectual
brilliance has been overshadowed by his independence. He generally
votes with the liberals but is unpredictable. He was with the
dissenters who voted to uphold laws against flag burning. Stevens
is known for his bow tie and his incisive, and unfailingly polite,
questioning of lawyers at oral arguments.
   Sandra Day O'Connor, 60, appointed to the court in 1981 by
Reagan. The only woman ever to be a justice, she has controlled the
balance of power until now on abortion issues. She also has been a
swing vote on affirmative action. O'Connor is generally
conservative but has provided some key liberal votes, particularly
on issues affecting women's rights. She is hardworking and not
given to broad pronouncements or sweeping rulings. She underwent a
mastectomy last year and says her cancer has been cured.
   Antonin Scalia, 54, appointed to the court in 1986 by Reagan. A
scholar and jurist of unquestioned brilliance, he has tried to pull
the court further to the right and has been outspoken in
criticizing conservative colleagues who prefer incremental change.
Scalia has a libertarian streak and strict adherence to
constitutional principles that occasionally produce a surprise. He
cast a recent dissenting vote when the court refused to grant child
abuse suspects the right to confront their young accusers in court.
   Anthony M. Kennedy, 53, appointed to the court in 1988 by
Reagan. The court's newest member solidified a conservative
majority but says he has felt no special pressure in being a
pivotal figure. An unassuming Californian, he was Reagan's third
choice for a vacancy created by the retirement of centrist Justice
Lewis F. Powell. Kennedy's major defections from the conservative
camp were his votes to strike down laws against flag burning.

   Singer Diana Ross is singing the blues
over a truck weigh station being built near her home in this
celebrity enclave.
   ``I try to talk to people about the weigh station _ and nobody
listens,'' said Ross. Ross said on Friday that she did get a good
reception from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bruce Morrison.
   Morrison, a congressman from Hamden, agrees with Ross and some
of her neighbors in the Belle Haven section of Greenwich that the
truck weigh station being built on Interstate 95 probably poses an
environmental hazard. They argue that exhaust from idling engines
would pollute the air and that fuel spills could make their way
into the nearby Long Island Sound.
   After having lunch with Ross and 17 other Greenwich residents,
Morrison pledged to keep the $6 million weigh station from
operating if elected governor.
   ``He seems like a nitty-gritty type of guy,'' Ross said. ``I
want to have a voice, and he listens.''
   The 46-year-old former Supreme's Greenwich estate was once the
home of tobacco heiress Nancy Reynolds.

   The prospect of reviewing every single word of
testimony in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial is so daunting,
prosecutors may decide instead to appeal the court-ordered
examination.
   They also could drop the case altogether, but that's unlikely
given the track record of the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office,
which has been aggressively pursuing the arms and money scandal for
more than 3{ years.
   The demanding review called for by a federal appeals court
suggests that prosecutors ``will fight tooth and nail not to have
to go through this tremendously cumbersome hearing procedure,''
said Paul Rothstein, a criminal law professor at Georgetown
University.
   Gerald Caplin, a George Washington University law professor,
said he would be ``surprised if the government doesn't appeal.''
   The appeals court Friday vacated all three convictions and sent
the case back to U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell for a hearing
to determine whether the case was tainted by the former White House
aide's televised testimony to Congress. North testified before
Congress with a grant of immunity from prosecution.
   In addition, the court reversed one conviction outright _ that
North altered and destroyed National Security Council documents.
That means the only way the conviction might be reinstated would be
through a new trial.
   The hearing process required by the appeals court ``may be
unworkable,'' acknowledged Paul L. Friedman, an attorney who
formerly worked in the office of North's prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh.
   ``If you really have to proceed witness by witness, that's a
heavy procedural burden,'' Friedman said.
   One way for the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office to proceed would
be to seek Supreme Court review of the appeals court decision.
   If Walsh concludes the appeals court decision ``goes beyond what
is required'' by the Supreme Court, ``then I think there is a
strong argument that Walsh go directly and get them to reverse this
opinion,'' Friedman said.
   Alternatively, the prosecution could seek a review by all 12
members of the court of appeals. Or it could attempt to proceed
with the hearing process before Gesell.
   Walsh could decide not to continue with the North case. His
office has said that it cost $20.9 million through May 31 to
convict seven individuals and one corporation. Others have put the
cost as high as $40 million.
   Walsh's office said only that ``We are studying the opinions to
determine the most appropriate next step.''
   A jury convicted North on May 4, 1989, of three of the 12
charges he faced. They were aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, altering and destroying NSC documents and accepting an
illegal gratuity.
   North on July 5, 1989, was sentenced to a suspended prison term,
was fined $150,000, put on two years' probation and ordered to
perform 1,200 hours of community service.
   Gesell's inquiry ``must proceed witness-by-witness,'' said the
appeals court in a ruling supported by Reagan administration
appointees Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle. Chief Judge
Patricia Wald, a Carter administration appointee, dissented.
   ``If necessary, it will proceed line-by-line and item-by-item,''
the court added.
   The majority on the court panel suggested that North's Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination may have been violated.
North was compelled to testify to Congress under a grant of
immunity. In that nationally televised testimony, he admitted many
of the activities for which he was later charged with crimes.
   The ruling also could signify trouble ahead for the Iran-Contra
case against North's old boss, former national security adviser
John Poindexter, who was convicted of five felonies in the
Iran-Contra case last April.
   Like North, Poindexter had given immunized testimony to Congress
in 1987. The question of taint in regard to Poindexter's testimony
will be a major issue on appeal, said Richard Beckler, one of his
lawyers.

   Nine more Cubans sought refuge Saturday in
the Spanish Embassy in Havana, bringing the total of asylum-seekers
to 18, Spanish officials said. Cuban police surrounded the embassy
and Spain said it was beefing up its guard.
   Diplomats wrangled, meanwhile, over whether to grant the Cubans
asylum and safe conduct out of the Caribbean island nation,
according to officials and news reports.
   Fidel Castro's Communist government has been insisting that all
asylum-seekers surrender to Cuban authorities without condition.
The government has called all those who have gone into the Spanish,
Czechoslovak and Italian embassies and diplomatic residences in
recent days ``scum'' and habitual vagrants.
   Spain has been insisting they should all be given asylum.
   In Madrid, the government announced it plans to send four or
five more members of a tactical police squad to Havana to reinforce
security at the embassy.
   A Spanish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
police would leave ``as soon as possible'' to join four other
members who arrived in Havana Thursday.
   The official said four more Cubans entered the embassy grounds
early Saturday, and five more gained access two hours later. Nine
Cubans were already holed up in the embassy.
   The Spanish news agency EFE said the first group entered the
embassy by way of a terrace, while the second group scaled one of
the embassy's outer walls and broke a balcony while trying to enter
the building.
   Notimex, the official Mexican news agency, said Cuban police
blocked several streets near the embassy and completely surrounded
it.
   Another four Cubans are at the residence of the Italian
ambassador.
   Five Cubans spent a week in a Czechoslovak diplomat's apartment
but gave up their bid for asylum Thursday after the Cuban
government assured them they would not be prosecuted.
   Cuban officials have been accusing foreign diplomats of
encouraging people to seek refuge at the embassies as part of a
plot to destabilize the Castro regime, one of the few orthodox
hard-line Communist administrations left.
   Foreign diplomats have rejected the accusations as unfounded,
accusing Cuban police in turn of violating diplomatic territory to
make arrests. In one incident, they said Cuban police entered
Spanish Embassy grounds to seize a refugee.
   The U.S. State Department called the Cuban accusations
``outrageous'' and a U.S. statement accused Cuban agents of trying
several times to compromise U.S. officials in Havana in recent
months.
   In Washington, Michael Kozak, a deputy assistant secretary of
state, called in a Cuban diplomat Friday to lodge a formal protest.
   The United States cut diplomatic relations and imposed a trade
embargo on Cuba in 1960, but under a 1977 agreement the two
countries maintain interest sections in other embassies in each
others' capitals.
   In April 1980, thousands of Cubans jammed the Peruvian Embassy
in Havana. Soon after that, many joined what became the Mariel boat
lift, which eventually took 125,000 Cubans to Florida.
   Spain recalled its ambassador in Havana for consultations on
Thursday after Cuba _ a Spanish colony for 406 years until 1898 _
called Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez a
``frustrated colonial administrator'' and a victim of ``historical
amnesia.''
   The Cuban government rebuked Fernandez for having publicly
suggested that Castro should be cautious about allowing Cubans to
leave since their departure would cause his regime to crumble.

   Americans with loved ones dead or missing from
the Vietnam War are welcoming President Bush's decision to hold
Cambodian peace talks with the heirs of Ho Chi Minh.
   Richard Cockrell of Sandusky, Ohio, moist-eyed after viewing the
names of friends and classmates on the Vietnam Memorial wall, spoke
for many.
   ``Somebody's got to start talking,'' the veteran of Navy service
in Vietnam said. ``We've been to war with them and that didn't
solve anything.''
   Randy Elmore, a member of the Vietnam Veterans of America post
in Bellingham, Wash., which has kept a chair vacant at its meetings
for a local man who disappeared in the Southeast Asia fighting,
agreed.
   ``The Vietnamese hold all the cards on the prisoners of war,''
Elmore said in a telephone interview from Bellingham. ``Opening the
dialogue is a good idea.''
   Except for limited contacts concerning servicemen still listed
as prisoners of war or missing in action, the United States has
shunned talks with the Vietnamese regime since Ho Chi Minh's
communist North Vietnamese defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam in
1975.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III ended that era Wednesday,
disclosing in Paris that the administration will take up the
question of peace in Cambodia directly with the Hanoi government,
which installed the current government in Phnom Penh. A Baker aide
said the decision was approved by the president.
   Gareth Porter, who was in Vietnam during the war as a journalist
and now teaches international relations at American University,
found it not surprising that Americans welcome the talks with the
regime that nearly 60,000 of them died fighting.
   ``I think they have been ready for far longer than the
administration,'' said Porter. ``The administration has lagged
behind public opinion on the question of letting bygones be
bygones.''
   Prior to Baker's announcement, members of Congress had urged
Bush to change U.S. policy in Cambodia, where a U.S.-backed
coalition that includes the communist Khmer Rouge is battling
Cambodian government forces.
   Representatives of organizations seeking the recovery of the
estimated 2,302 Americans still missing in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia said they welcome the administration's initiative.
   ``If the U.S. government feels that announced official Cambodian
discussions with the Vietnamese will help bring a solution to the
Cambodian problem, then I think all Americans would have to applaud
that,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive secretary of the
National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in
Southeast Asia.
   Dolores Alfond of Seattle, chairwoman of the National Alliance
of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, said,
``We are very anxious for dialogue, but of course we feel that in
the dialogue, there should be negotiations for our prisoners of
war.''
   Ms. Alfond, whose brother, Air Force Capt. Victor Apodaca,
disappeared during a 1967 flight over North Vietnam, welcomed
Baker's statement that normalization is linked to Hanoi's
cooperation on the missing in action issue.
   Elmore was more skeptical, saying, ``I think the administration
has to make some demands, and they haven't.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle told the National League of Families
on July 13 that Vietnamese cooperation in U.S. efforts to track
down reported POWs and MIAs could ``remove the last vestige of the
war and lay the groundwork for improved relations in the context of
a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia.''
   At the same meeting, Robert M. Kimmitt, undersecretary of State
for political affairs, assured the families ``that we do not dwell
on the past or harbor vindictiveness in our approach to Vietnam and
its neighbors.''
   Officials were at pains to say the talks would not deal with the
prospect of normalizing relations with Hanoi.
   From the time U.S. ground troops were first sent to Vietnam in
1965 until the last of the troops were pulled out after the South
Vietnamese surrender 10 years later, the Southeast Asian war
increasingly convulsed American life. Some critics called it an
immoral war; others said the fighting men were being hamstrung by
the politicians.
   By the time it was over, about 57,000 U.S. troops had died,
approximately 46,600 of them in combat. South Vietnam had lost
about 254,300 men and North Vietnam more than a million.
   George A. Carver, a former CIA specialist on Vietnam now with
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the memory
of the unpopular Vietnam war is no reason for America to shun
contact with Hanoi.
   ``A great power has to look after its interests,'' Carver said.
``It can't be rendered catatonic by the fact that people might
criticize it for something that happened 15 years ago.''

<HEAD>March Commemorating Revolution Turns to Anti-Communist Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PIRVULESCU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A march commemorating the December
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu turned
into an anti-Communist rally Saturday.
   Demonstrators chanted ``Down with Communism!'' and ``Down with
Iliescu!'' Opponents have demanded the resignation of President Ion
Iliescu, a former Communist who won free elections in May, saying
he condones totalitarianism.
   Meanwhile, the trial of 24 former top Communist Party and
government officials opened but was adjourned until Monday.
   The 24, all former members of the Communist Party Politburo, are
accused of having backed Ceausescu's orders to shoot at
demonstrators last December as the revolution began.
   The defendants, who include a former foreign minister and former
vice premier, face maximum sentences of life in prison.
   The adjournment came after the defense asked that court
president be replaced because he was one of the five judges in the
secret trial of Ceausescu and his wife Elena, who were executed on
Christmas Day.
   More than 2,000 people turned out for Saturday's march, which
was organized by the 21 December Association, a leading opposition
group.
   Demonstrators knelt, prayed and lit candles for the victims of
the revolution seven months ago that ended 45 years of Communist
rule in Romania.
   The march began in Bucharest's central University Square, the
site of much of the fighting during the initial days of the
revolution.
   The square was also the site of a 53-day anti-government protest
that was violently broken up by police last month, setting off
riots that the government put down with the help of club-wielding
vigilante coal miners.
   December's popular uprising left at least 1,038 dead and more
than 2,600 injured, according to official figures.
   Referring to those who lost their lives in the revolution, Eugen
Botoc, a 43-year-old driver, said: ``They died happy because they
thought they did it.''
   But like many other protesters, he seemed unhappy with the
results of the revolution.
   ``There is no chance for us but to flee _ to flee from
Communism,'' he said. Adrian Chiriac, a 19-year-old student, told a
small crowd that ``old times have come back, with the same old hope
of running away'' to the West.
   He carried a huge banner saying: ``The only hope that is left is
... to defect.''
   Before dispersing peacefully, the demonstrators distributed
leaflets announcing a student-organized demonstration Sunday to
call for the release of jailed student activist Marian Munteanu.
   Similar demonstrations were planned in the Transylvanian city of
Brasov and in the western city of Timisoara, the cradle of the
revolution, sources said.
   Munteanu was one of the leaders of the 53-day University Square
demonstration. Students have organized demonstrations to protest
his detention, including one last week in downtown Bucharest that
drew about 20,000 people.
   Iliescu was harshly criticized abroad for Munteanu's arrest and
for calling in pro-government miners last month, who
indiscriminately beat demonstrators and passers-by.
   Iliescu told a news conference Friday that since Munteanu is in
pre-trial detention, prosecutors could release him ``with an
appropriate motive.''
   As president, Iliescu maintained, he only has the power to
``reprieve people from jail.''

<HEAD>Jury: Prosecutors Liable for Failing to Protect Witness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman set on fire by her estranged husband
just before she was to testify against him has won a $1.15 million
judgment against prosecutors, whom she charged failed to protect
her.
   However, the woman will receive just $50,000 _ the maxiumum for
which the state could be held liable when she filed her suit. Since
then, the state's liability has been raised to $100,000 in such
cases.
   Attorneys in the case said they believe it may set a national
precedent for holding prosecutors accountable for the safety of
witnesses they subpoena.
   ``Justice has been served,'' Ruby Whylly Powell said after the
jury verdict in her favor Friday. But ``no kind of money can
compensate me for what I've been through.''
   She suffered third-degree burns over half of her body when
Jerome Whylly talked her into leaving the Hillsborough County
courthouse, doused her with gasoline and threw a lighted match at
her in July 1981.
   Jurors deliberated more than four hours before returning a total
judgment of $2.3 million. But they also ruled Ms. Powell and the
state attorney's office shared negligence equally, reducing the
prosecution's liability to half of the award.
   Pamela Lutton-Shields, chief trial counsel for the state
attorney general's office, would say only that an appeal was being
considered.
   Ms. Powell was 22 in 1981 when she was called to testify against
her husband in a probation revocation case. She was to testify that
he burned their 6-month-old son with cigarettes and beat and bit
him.
   The 1988 suit said Ms. Powell went to prosecutors twice before
the attack and asked for protection, offering her husband's
threatening letters as evidence. In one letter, he wrote, ``Best
enjoy your time left on this earth.''
   The Hillsborough County state attorney's office told her not to
worry because he was safely behind bars. However, Whylly had been
let out of jail on his own recognizance because of an error by the
prosecutor's office, Ms. Powell's attorneys contended.
   ``The state attorney did nothing,'' said Ms. Powell's attorney,
James D. Clark. ``They could have provided her an escort the day of
the court hearing, or subpoenaed her husband at a different time.''
   Whylly, now 39, was convicted of attempted murder for the attack
on Ms. Powell and sentenced to 114 years in prison.
   Ms. Powell, now a 31-year-old divorced mother of two who works
as a custodian, has undergone dozens of operations over the past
nine years to reduce scarring on her face, arms and torso.
   Her oldest son, now 12, refuses to live with her and moved in
with her parents after the attack. She said ``he's still scared of
my face, the scars and all.''
   But she said she's prepared to endure any more legal battles.
   ``I've gotten this far. I'm in it till the end.''

<HEAD>His Nearly 1,200 Opinions Second In Number Only to Late William O.
Douglas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly thirty years ago, Dwight David
Eisenhower was asked by a television interviewer if he had made any
serious mistakes during his presidency. ``Yes, two,'' said Ike.
``And they are both sitting on the Supreme Court.''
   Earl Warren is long gone. But until late Friday, William Joseph
Brennan, 84, was still there, staving off the conservative tilt
that Eisenhower and all Republican presidents since have envisioned
for the court.
   What piqued Eisenhower was that Brennan, like Warren, turned out
to be a powerful judicial activist, rather than a strict
interpreter of the Constitution. Even toward the end, when he was
outnumbered in the wake of Ronald Reagan's three appointments to
the court, he still held great sway with his colleagues.
   ``No individual ... has had a more profound and sustained impact
upon public policy in the United States'' over the past three
decades, according to the grudging tribute of the National Review
several years ago.
   ``His footprints are everywhere,'' said U.S. Appeals Judge Abner
J. Mikva. ``His influence can be felt in nearly every area of the
law.''
   In his 34 years on the bench, Brennan wrote more than 1,200
opinions, second only to the late William O. Douglas. Among them
are many landmark decisions on civil liberties, including the one
person-one vote doctrine for apportioning state legislatures. Other
decisions ordered school desegregation, upheld affirmative action
plans for minority groups, struck down state aid to religious
schools, and established constitutional protections for libel
defendants.
   Brennan also wrote several of the court's rulings on obscenity,
including a 1966 decision involving the 18th-century novel, ``Fanny
Hill,'' in which he added a new test for obscenity: whether the
material was ``utterly without redeeming social value.''
   Along with Justice Thurgood Marshall, Brennan believes that the
death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and
unusual punishment, and he consistently voted to protect condemned
prisoners who came to the court appealing for their lives.
Increasingly he was on the losing side, the latest time just
Thursday night in a Virginia case.
   ``The right to dissent is one of the great and cherished
freedoms that we enjoy by virtue of the excellent accident of our
birth as Americans,'' he said in a speech earlier this year.
   ``I do not mean to suggest that one has a duty or right simply
to make noise,'' Brennan said. ``What I am saying is that all of us
_ judges, lawyers, students, teachers, factory workers, bankers _
must recognize values which are so important to us that we cannot
remain silent if and when we feel those values threatened.''
   While Brennan's service on the court has had a huge impact on
American law, his sudden retirement Friday could well have a bigger
one. The court's 5 to 4 conservative majority has moved tentatively
until now, often tempering its decisions to win the swing votes of
Sandra Day O'Connor in some cases, Byron R. White in others. With
President Bush sure to appoint another solid conservative, the
court almost certainly will move further to the right in major
cases _ including those involving abortion, racial discrimination,
separation of church and state, and freedom of speech.
   ``In recent years, the other side has pretty much carried the
day,'' Brennan said in an interview in April. ``That strikes me as
nothing to be surprised about. After all, the president fills the
vacancies.''
   He said then that when he did leave, it would be for health
reasons. And until recently, he showed little sign of slowing down.
He still arose at 5 a.m., spent an hour on his Exercycle and put in
a full day at the court. ``It's exciting,'' he said. ``It's
thrilling to be here every day, since the day I came.''
   But ``I think it would be so wrong to stay here unless you're
fully able to do your job,'' Brennan said in the interview, which
was just before his 84th birthday. ``Too much rides on what we do
around here.''
   Brennan was a New Jersey Supreme Court justice when he was
appointed to the nation's highest court. He was confirmed by the
Senate in March 1957 with only one dissenting vote _ from Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis. Earlier, Brennan had compared McCarthy's
congressional hearings with the Salem witch-hunts.
   Brennan was born on April 25, 1906, in Newark, N.J., the
second-oldest of eight children. His father, Brennan Sr., was an
Irish immigrant whose first job in the United States was as a coal
shoveler in a brewery. The elder Brennan rose through the ranks to
become a labor leader and served as Newark's commissioner of public
safety.
   Although he delivered milk in Newark when he was a boy and
handed out change in trolley cars, Brennan scoffed at suggestions
his was a ``rags-to-riches'' story.
   ``I'm no Horatio Alger,'' he once said. ``My father paid all my
expenses till he died, then I was lucky enough to get a scholarship
to finish Harvard Law.''
   In recent years, Brennan has worried most about what he
perceives as the court's failure to uphold privacy rights. In an
interview with the New Yorker, he recited the Fourth Amendment
verbatim: ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effect, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but
upon probably cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be searched.''
   Brennan repeated the words ``probable cause,'' then added:
``It's a high standard the Framers wanted. And it means that no
search may be conducted unless the official knows of facts and
circumstances warrant a prudent man to believe than an offense has
been committed.''
   By his account, the court has condoned several practices _ strip
searches, police dragnets, random drug searches and tests _ that
fail to meet that standard.
   Once, a radio reporter playfully baited him with the question:
``Why do you let some of these creeps go? They do such bad things,
and on some technicality, you let them go.''
   ``Honestly,'' Brennan said. ``You in the media ought to be
ashamed of your selves to call the provisions and the guarantees of
the Bill of Rights `technicalities.' They're not. They're very
basic to our very existence as the kind of society we are. We are
what we are because we have those guarantees, and this court exists
to see that those guarantees are faithfully enforced. They are not
technicalities!''
   In a speech he wrote to celebrate the 200th birthday of the
Constitution, he declared that ``one thing the old parchment is not
is a china doll that has to be protected from the regular world by
a good layer of cotton wool. It is a tough old soldier.''
   As is William Joseph Brennan.

   President Bush reminisced about his
days as a naval aviator at Saturday's christening of the
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington.
   ``Things were quite different then,'' said Bush, who flew as a
carrier pilot in World War II. ``The planes were slower, the ships
were smaller.
   ``And as I looked around at these admirals and some of the
enlisted men and women I had the privilege to meet with, they all
seem younger today,'' Bush told a crowd of about 15,000 at Newport
News Shipbuilding.
   The $3.57 billion George Washington is the sixth Nimitz-class
carrier built at the only shipyard in the nation capable of
building the huge warships.
   The last ship named the George Washington was the country's
first submarine capable of firing Polaris missiles.
   ``That was in 1960. We faced the dangers and uncertainities of a
new kind of threat then _ the nuclear Cold War,'' Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said in introducing Bush. `` ... The submarine George
Washington helped provide the deterrence our freedom required.''
   Calling the aircraft carriers the nation's ``designated
hitters,'' Cheney said the carrier George Washington would help
provide the same strength and security to maintain peace.
   Bush said the carriers are ``an indispensable element of our
nation's defense, projecting power and preserving peace. ... So
today, we must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed
forces sufficient to sustain our national interest.''
   ``We will not shrink from this responsibility,'' Bush said.
``And let the George Washington proclaim America's commitment to
remain forever free.''
   The crowd cheered and waved flags as first lady Barbara Bush
christened the ship with the traditional bottle of champagne. As
the bottle broke on the ship's bow, the ship's sirens and horns
sounded and four Navy jets flew overhead.
   Construction of the 91,487-ton ship began in 1986. Refinements
in construction techniques have speeded the building of the Nimitz
carriers, and the George Washington was completed nearly two years
faster than the first of its class.
   Two other Nimitz carriers are under construction at the yard.
   When the Washington is commissioned in late 1991, the ship ill
be home to 2,800 officers and sailors. Another 2,700 will be aboard
when the ship adds it air wing of 85 aircraft.
   The carrier measures 1,040 feet from bow to stern and 1,092 feet
on its flight deck. From its keel to the top of the its mast the
ship is 244 feet high _ the equivalent of a 24-story building.
   The galley will serve 18,150 meals a day. The ship can travel
more than 45 mph at full speed, and its air-conditioning plant can
cool the equivalent of 2,000 homes. The ship has more than 900
miles of electrical cable, more than 1 million tubes, transistors
and diodes, and more than 2,000 telephones in its 3,000
compartments.
   The ship will be able to travel 800,000 miles to 1 million miles
before its nuclear reactors need refueling.
   The Washington is the 26th carrier built at the yard.

   Arab mediators contacted President Saddam
Hussein on Saturday in a bid to defuse his country's dispute with
Kuwait, and Iraq's army newspaper hinted at military action against
the Persian Gulf emirate.
   The official Baghdad Radio said Saudi Arabia's foreign minister,
Prince Saud, handed Saddam a letter from King Fahd on
``developments in the region.''
   It gave no details. But the Saudi leader and other Arab leaders
have been making intense efforts to settle the crisis in the
oil-rich gulf region.
   On Tuesday, Saddam accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
of flooding the oil market and driving prices down.
   Saddam claimed the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil
revenue.
   He also charged that Arab states in the Persian Gulf were
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup. He warned he would
retaliate with force, if necessary.
   Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency said President Hosni
Mubarak telephoned Saddam on Saturday in an effort to calm rising
tensions in the region. It also reported that Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tareq Aziz was expected to fly to Cairo on Sunday.
   The Iraq News Agency reported that Saddam also received calls
from King Hussein of Jordan and President Ali Abdullah Saleh of
Yemen.
   Another mediator, Arab League Secretary-General Chadli Klibi,
met in Kuwait with that country's ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, Saturday before flying to Baghdad.
   Iraq, with an army of nearly 1 million battle-seasoned men, has
been amassing long-range missiles and chemical weapons since the
cease-fire was declared in 1987 terminating hostilities in the
eight-year Persian Gulf war.
   Iraq's official radio quoted an unidentified government
spokesman as attacking Kuwait for sending a memorandum to the U.N.
Security Council explaining its position in the dispute with Iraq.
   The spokesman said the move meant ``Kuwaiti rulers have given up
the Arab option and insist on carrying out an imperialist plot
against Iraq.''
   Kuwait and Saudi Arabia supported Iraq during the war by
providing interest-free loans totalling almost $35 billion.
   Iraq, saddled with a war debt to non-Arab states of $30 billion,
has demanded that Arab countries write off the loans, claiming that
Iraq saved the conservative Gulf states from Iranian fundamentalism.
   Saturday, the army daily, al-Qadissiya, warned in a front-page
editorial that Iraq will take action to ``protect its rights and
interests.''
   It did not spell out what that action might be. But it stressed:
``Iraq has emerged victorious from the fierce war ... and is now
capable of standing up to this and other plots.''
   There were no reports from either side of any military buildup
along the disputed frontier. Kuwait put its 20,300-member armed
forces on alert Wednesday, but cancelled the alert Thursday night.

<HEAD>Weather Could Cloud Eclipse Spectacle for Finns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to
mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping
to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
   The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening,
when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather
with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
   In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late
Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle
falling.
   The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. Sunday (9:03
p.m. EDT Saturday). At that time, the moon will begin gradually
moving between the Earth and the sun.
   The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last
83 seconds. After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon will
move away, uncovering more and more of the sun. The eclipse ends at
5:45 a.m. in Helsinki.
   About 10,000 people _ including 3,000 foreigners _ have
converged on Joensuu, about 50 miles from the Soviet border. There
conditions there are considered especially good for viewing the
eclipse _ weather permitting.
   In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after
sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. At
Joensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees
above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers.
   The sun rises unusually early during summer in the extreme
northern latitudes where Finland is located. The sun comes up
unusually late during winter.
   Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an ``eclipse secretary'' to handle
arrangements for the expected influx of visitors.
   But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated the
interest in the event.
   ``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we made
for this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said in
a television interview Saturday.
   During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been
full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for
spectators not to stare directly into the sun.
   Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds,
because they will be above them. Finnair, the national airline, has
arranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers, and private
companies with small planes will provide more.
   The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from
the northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the Kola
Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands near
Alaska.
   Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse,
including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun.
However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in
longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from
northern Kenya on June 30, 1973.
   Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said the
best place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeast
Soviet Union.
   The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.

<HEAD>Heat Puts the Flame Out in the Henhouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heat is on in the henhouse, but the
flame is out.
   Chickens don't like to mate in high temperatures, when they also
become sluggish eaters, says Frank Jones, a poultry expert at North
Carolina State University.
   That means layers aren't laying as often as they do in lower
temperatures and the birds that are supposed to gorge for slaughter
are taking their time about it, said Jones and Holly Farms
spokesman Gordon Miller.
   ``They're subject to a lot of the same stresses we are as
humans,'' Jones said. ``That means there will be less mating. They
don't really feel like eating.''
   Turkeys react the same way to summer heat, which has been in the
90s in North Carolina, the nation's top turkey producer and the No.
4 chicken producer. The state is expected to sell more than $1.5
billion worth of poultry this year.
   Miller said consumers may end up getting burned. If the heat
continues, fewer birds could be on the market in time for
Thanksgiving and Christmas and fewer eggs could drive up prices.
   Perdue Farms Inc. spokesman Steve McCauley doesn't believe that
higher prices are a given.
   He said Friday that since the heat is an annual summer ailment,
most growers are prepared.
   ``Typically, if a flock is affected, it's because something went
wrong _ fans broke, alarms didn't work,'' McCauley said.
   ``But one flock is a few thousand birds and Perdue processes 1.6
million a week, and that's Perdue alone, so the loss of a flock or
two would never have a significant impact on prices,'' he said.

   A 25-year-old man who was put behind bars
eight years ago for rape and robbery went free after someone who
looks like him confessed, attorneys said.
   Randall Lynn Ayers _ who was sent to prison for 14 to 50 years
in 1982 in the rape, robbery and shooting of a 15-year-old girl _
was ordered released Friday by Common Pleas Judge Thomas Crush
after police said another man had confessed.
   ``It was a long wait,'' Ayers said. ``I didn't believe this
would happen. I had given up.''
   Ayers' attorney, Elizabeth Agar, said her client looks like the
other man. ``Basically the only evidence in the case was eyewitness
testimony,'' Ms. Agar said. ``You can see how a witness could make
a mistake.''
   Prosecutors would not identify the man who confessed.
   However, sources in the police department speaking on condition
of anonymity told The Cincinnati Post the man who confessed was
Robert Minton, 29, charged earlier this week in the slaying of two
Cincinnati women.
   Senior Assistant Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier asked Crush to set
aside Ayers' conviction. According to Piepmeier, a police
investigator said the man who confessed offered details of the
crime that ``fit all the way down the line.''
   The victim of the 1981 attack looked at Ayers and the man who
confessed and could not identify which was her assailant, Piepmeier
said.
   Ayers was a 17-year-old high school senior when he was charged.
The girl was robbed of $1 and shot in the neck. Friends testified
at his trial that he was with them at the time.
   ``A jury convicted Randy Ayers,'' said Judge Crush. ``I
expressed the opinion at the time that I would not have convicted
him had it been tried to me.''

<HEAD>Ethiopia Peace Talks Stalled Over U.N. Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NAJI AL-HARAZI</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Peace talks between Eritrean rebels and the
Ethiopian government aimed at ending the 29-year-old civil war
failed to get off the ground Saturday, officials and diplomats
reported.
   Foreign Ministry officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Yemeni-sponsored talks were postponed until Aug. 15.
   The officials said the talks failed because the Eritreans wanted
the United Nations to organize a plebiscite in the north Ethiopian
province where they have been waging a secessionist war in the East
African nation since 1961.
   A spokesman for the Ethiopian Embassy in San`a said the Eritrean
proposal was ``no problem from our side.''
   But he added: ``It's the United Nations which rejects such
participation because they consider the problem to be an internal
problem. ... As far as I know, there are no relevant U.N.
resolutions on the issue.''
   Earlier this year, Yemen played host to a first round of talks
between the Ethiopians and a group of rebel factions united under
the banner of the Eritrean Liberation Front.
   The strongest rebel faction, the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front, was involved in separate peace talks last year that were
sponsored by former President Jimmy Carter. Those negotiations have
also deadlocked.
   The Eritrean rebels have recently scored major successes on the
battlefield. They have captured all of Eritrea except the
provincial capital, Asmara, which they are surrounding.

   Rain and clouds were scattered from the Rockies to the East
Coast on Saturday, and temperatures plummeted on the northern
Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms formed along a stationary front and
were numerous from eastern Oklahoma and eastern Kansas to northern
Illinois, and across Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   Strong thunderstorms also developed over the central
Appalachians.
   Thunderstorms also developed over parts of New Jersey,
southeastern New York, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed ahead of an upper-level
weather disturbance over eastern North Carolina, and also were
scattered across the Gulf Coast states.
   Clouds, drizzle and light rain prevailed from Colorado and
Wyoming across South Dakota and Nebraska.
   The heaviest rainfall for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
1.04 inches at Fort Knox, Ky.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 50s and 60s from the
northern and central high Plains into Nebraska and the Dakotas.
   Overnight readings dipped into the 40s and 50s in the northern
Plains and the Rockies, and into the 50s in the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes, and northern Nevada.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 40 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo., and Belgrade, Mont.
   Hot weather prevailed west of the Rockies, with temperatures
rising above 100 degrees in the desert Southwest and into the lower
90s as far north as Washington state.
   Temperatures in northern California at midday ranged from 56

<HEAD>Mussolini's Son Asks for Removal of `Fascist' From Plaques</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of the late dictator Benito
Mussolini asked officials Saturday to remove the word ``Fascist''
from two plaques recalling a 1980 terrorist bombing at the Bologna
train station.
   The request was made after a court this week threw out the
convictions of four people sentenced to life in prison for the
bombing, which killed 85 people.
   Prosecutors had described the attack as part of a neo-Fascist
plot to undermine Italy's democracy, and the four were convicted of
planting the bomb as right-wing terrorists.
   In his petition to the city prefect, or Interior Ministry
representative, Vittorio Mussolini asked for the removal of the
word ``Fascist'' from descriptions of the attack on plaques at the
train station and the city hall of Bologna.
   ``The sentence pronounced in recent days by the court ...
attests to the fact that the attribution (on the plaques) is
unfounded and misleading and that therefore the offense is grave,
defamatory and provocative,'' Mussolini wrote in his petition,
presented by his lawyer.
   He added that to Fascists, the Bologna bombing was ``morally
unacceptable and idealogically inconceivable.''
   There was no immediate response from the prefect, Bruno Ciccone.
   Benito Mussolini, the first of Europe's fascist dictators, ruled
Italy for 23 years.

   Israel will likely launch within two weeks its
first test of a U.S.-funded anti-missile missile, the commander of
the Israeli air force said in an interview broadcast Saturday.
   The Arrow missile is being developed with U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative funds to combat short-range ballistic missiles. The U.S.
program is better known as ``Star Wars.''
   In Washington, the U.S. Defense Department announced Friday that
it would pay for the second phase of the Arrow program.
   Washington provided 80 percent of the $158 million in the first
phase of the project, and Israel's Defense Ministry supplied the
balance. Israel is seeking about $200 million from the United
States for the second phase of development.
   Air force commander Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin Nun, speaking on Israel
radio, said the Arrow could be operational within five years.
   When asked if the first test would be launched within two weeks,
he said: ``This is a good assumption.''
   The Arrow, which has already undergone three simulated ground
tests, is designed to defend against ballistic missiles with a
range of 600 miles or less.
   Bin Nun said the Arrow was needed in light of efforts by Iraq
and Syria to develop chemical and nuclear warheads.

<TEXT>
   About 200,000 rock music fans cheered as a
mock Berlin Wall came tumbling down midnight Saturday at a benefit
concert where the real divider once stood.
   Cyndi Lauper, Sinead O'Connor, Joni Mitchell and other stars
performed songs from Pink Floyd's 1979 rock epic ``The Wall'' on a
stage flanked by the massive plastic-foam wall meant to mimic the
dismantled Berlin Wall.
   Organizers sold 180,000 tickets but finally ordered the removal
of security fences to accommodate a huge crush of people. They
streamed onto the strip of land where trespassers during Communist
rule would have been shot instead of serenaded.
   ``There was so many people _ a lot of people without tickets _
that in the end it was safer to just put the fences down,'' said
concert spokeswoman Wendy Laister. She estimated the crowd at
200,000.
   The 6{-hour concert was billed around the world as the biggest
rock benefit ever. Proceeds were go to a fund for disaster victims.
   But thousands of fans began streaming out before the concert
reached its climax. Many complained about the poor sound system,
the difficulty most spectators had seeing the stage, and the
wind-whipped cloud of dust and dirt that hovered over the 35-acre
concert site.
   ``It wasn't good enough,'' said Corinna Treitel, 24, an American
studying in Berlin. ``I can go home and turn on the TV.''
   The carnival-like event _ held on a dust-choked expanse of land
that was once enclosed by the Berlin Wall _ began in late afternoon
and climaxed at night with a spectacular performance of Pink
Floyd's 1979 rock epic ``The Wall.''
   The concert was headlined by Roger Waters, a founder of Pink
Floyd who composed ``The Wall'' but has since left the group.
   The 600-foot-long and 60-foot high mock wall, made of 2,500
Styrofoam bricks, came crashing down at midnight at the concert's
climax.
   Many young people _ East and West Germans as well as foreigners
_ pitched tents or sat under the stars near the concert site _
Potsdamer Platz, a former main square of old Berlin that was
reduced to a desolate no-man's land when the Communists put up the
Berlin Wall in 1961.
   The wall around the plaza was torn down three months ago in
anticipation of German unification.
   When the concert began around 5:30 p.m., tens of thousands of
people were crowded onto the former ``death strip'' on the East
Berlin side of the Berlin Wall.
   ``I used to watch concerts like this on West German
television,'' said 30-year-old East German Angelika Arnold, adding
that her country's turn to democracy made the concert _ and her
attendance _ possible.
   There were many British and U.S. tourists among the sprawling
sea of relaxed fans who sat through the concert.
   Dave McCarthy said he rode 24 hours on a bus from Manchester,
England, to attend.
   ``It's pretty amazing that not too long ago they would have shot
someone who was sitting where I'm sitting,'' said the 31-year-old
banker as he sprawled on the dirt. ``But I'm not sure how many
people are into the politics. It's a pop concert.''
   Tents and stands filled the grounds, selling everything from
jewelry to Pepsi and wurst. The day was bright and hot, and
concert-goers wore shorts and T-shirts.
   Rock bands such as the Hooters and the Irish folk group the
Chieftains, accompanied by flutist James Galway, played opening
sets before the performance of ``The Wall'' began at night.
   Huge projectors showed scenes from the century's wars on the
giant plastic foam wall on stage.
   The concert also featured a six-story-high inflatible pig and an
equally large teacher, two characters in Pink Floyd's atmospheric,
other-worldly music.
   ``The Wall,'' which was made into a movie in 1982, is about
alienation and the manipulation of the minds of individuals by
authorities. It is not specifically about the Berlin Wall, though.
   The concert cost $8 million to stage and profits, as well as
those from a planned album and video, are to go to a disaster
relief fund, the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief.
   Ms. Laister said it was uncertain how much of the proceeds would
go to the disaster relief fund after expenses.

<HEAD>Theater Critics Ask Congress to Remove NEA Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Theatre Critics
Association on Saturday urged Congress to continue funding the
National Endowment for the Arts without restrictions on content.
   In a statement unanimously adopted by the 70 critics at the
group's convention, the association said that for 25 years the NEA
has ``fostered the arts in America and has provided enriching
cultural opportunities for millions of Americans to participate in
the arts as artists and audiences.''
   Last year, President Bush signed into law an NEA approprations
bill that included restrictions on artists receiving federal money.
   To receive NEA money, artists were asked to sign pledges they
wouldn't depict ``sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts and
which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific merit.''
   The NEA had come under fire for partially financing a
controversial exhibit by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and
giving a small grant to Andres Serrano, who photographed a plastic
crucifix in urine.
   ``As working theater critics, the members of this organization
are in an ideal position to appreciate the value of the NEA,'' said
Welton Jones, chairman of the 300-member association and drama
critic for the San Diego Union. ``That is why we enthusiastically
support the unrestricted renewal of the NEA authorization and
funding.''
   The statement urged Congress to ``reauthorize the NEA without
restrictions on artistic content, leaving its traditional fiscal
and evaluative structure intact, so that creativity can continue to
flourish in the United States.''

   A lock of George Washington's hair fetched $2,750
at an auction of celebrity memorabilia Saturday, which also
featured a package of letters written by mass murderers and Adolf
Hitler.
   The lock from the nation's first president went to a bidder,
who, like the other buyers and the sellers, requested anonymity
from the DuMouchelles auction house in Detroit, said auctioneer Joe
DuMouchelle.
   The collection of letters from John Wayne Gacy, David Berkowitz,
Charles Manson and Hitler brought $700.
   Fecthing the highest price was Babe Ruth's 700th home-run
baseball, sold for $9,300 by a New Jersey buyer, said DuMouchelle,
whose family owns the auction house.
   An autographed photograph of Marilyn Monroe, who died in 1962,
brought $5,000, the robe worn by Sylvester Stallone in ``Rocky
III'' sold for $2,400, and a pair of silk boxer shorts once owned
by actor Jack Nicholson went for $700.
   Two art deco etchings by Louis Icart sold for $7,000 and $6,500
each, the auctioneer said.
   The items were auctioned off in estate sales and the
standing-room only crowd of bidders came from across the nation,
DuMouchelle said.
   Manson is serving a life prison term for the California murders
of starlet Sharon Tate and six others by members of his cult
``family'' in 1969; Gacy was convicted in 1980 of the sex-related
killings of 33 young men in suburban Chicago, more murders than
anyone in U.S. history; ``Son of Sam'' killer Berkowitz murdered
six people in New York City and wounded seven others in 1976 and
1977.

   The Communist Khmer Rouge said Saturday
it is preparing to attack a major town 75 miles north of the
Cambodian capital.
   The announcement came three days after the United States
announced it was withdrawing recognition of the tripartite
guerrilla coalition and would open talks with Vietnam on ending the
Cambodian war. The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of the
resistance forces.
   Khmer Rouge radio said hundreds of civilian supporters _
including children _ were carrying supplies, weapons and ammunition
to guerrillas preparing to strike at Kompong Thom, the capital of
the central province of the same name. The Khmer Rouge and
non-Communist guerrillas loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk have
seized wide areas of the province in recent months in some of their
largest gains of the 11-year-old war.
   The two groups are allied with Son Sann's Khmer People's
National Liberation Front in a coalition fighting the
Vietnamese-installed government. The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of
thousands of people during its nearly four-year rule before
Vietnam's late 1978 invasion installed the current government in
Phnom Penh.
   In Washington, Japanese officials said Secretary of State James
A. Baker III has sought their help in trying to persuade China to
restrain the Khmer Rouge. A senior Japanese delegation is scheduled
to visit China next week.
   U.S. intelligence has reported that China annually gives the
Khmer Rouge about $100 million in aid.
   The Phnom Penh government on Saturday urged the Khmer Rouge and
China to return to peace talks.
   ``We hope the Khmer Rouge and their patron in Beijing will
return to the negotiating table to resolve the Cambodian problem by
peaceful means,'' the official SPK news agency said.
   As first steps, it said, they should cooperate with an agreement
reached last month in Tokyo to begin a cease-fire, stop receiving
foreign military aid and participate in free elections under U.N.
supervision.
   The agreement was signed by Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen
and Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge boycotted the Tokyo talks, and China
later said it did not support the agreement.
   The Phnom Penh government has been weakened by internal dissent
and a drastic reduction in foreign aid from the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   The guerrillas have recently increased their attacks. Some Khmer
Rouge officials said a truce without an overall political
settlement would only benefit the beleaguered Phnom Penh government.
   Guerrilla leader Son Sann said Saturday a four-party coalition,
including Prime Minister Hun Sen, should sit together in Cambodia's
seat at the United Nations.
   He invited his guerrilla coalition partners and the prime
minister to meet him to negotiate formation of a supreme national
council. He said the council could then occupy the U.N. seat.
   He described Baker as ``a good friend of Cambodia'' but said he
had been pressured by congressmen ``who listen too much to
Vietnamese propaganda'' that the Khmer Rouge are ``bad people.''
   ``Yes, I know and I accept that _ but the Vietnamese are
worse,'' he said in the live interview from Paris on the Channel 4
TV program ``The World This Week'' in Britain.
   Under U.S. pressure, the United Nations has awarded a seat to
the Cambodian resistance coalition and denied formal recognition to
the Sen's government.
   Baker had said the United States was also changing its policy
toward the Cambodian U.N. seat.
   
   A senior administration official said the United States will no
longer support seating a member of the resistance coalition, as
long as it includes the Khmer Rouge, but would not support awarding
the Sen government the seat either.

   George C. Waiss, an animator whose
cartoon credits included Walt Disney's 1940 classic ``Fantasia''
and who went on to help design Titan missile silos, has died at age
83.
   Waiss, who also worked on Andy Panda and Woody Woodpecker
cartoons, died of pneumonia Tuesday at the Alpine Manor nursing
home in this Denver suburb and was buried Friday in his nearby
hometown of Brighton.
   ``He had no formal education and was completely self-taught.
Just give him a pen and some paper and tell him what you want, and
he could do the job,'' said his son, Fred G. Waiss, of Sidney, Neb.
   The Chicago native moved to Colorado Springs at age 2, and grew
up there. After a brief career as a boxer, he worked as an artist
for the Rocky Mountain News and Denver Post.
   In the 1930s, he moved to Miami, where he worked as an animator
for Woody Woodpecker creator Walter Lantz. He then worked for Max
Fleischer Studios, which produced many movie cartoons in the 1930s
and 1940s.
   Waiss then joined Walt Disney Studios in California, where he
worked on ``Fantasia.''
   In the early 1960s, he was a draftsman for Martin Marietta,
where he helped design Titan silos.
   Later, he was a freelance artist and worked on medical
educational films. In 1967, he did the animation for ``Twas the
Night Before Christmas'' and in 1968 ``Archy and Mehitabel.''
   He retired in 1983.
   Other survivors include his wife, Annette Westerman Waiss of
Brighton; another son, William E. Waiss of Brighton; and three
grandchildren.

   Crews worked Saturday to repair a
helium leak that forced the postponement of the launch of an Atlas
rocket, but a spokesman said the problem will be fixed in time for
a Sunday blastoff.
   The rocket holds a government satellite designed to study
Earth's invisible magnetic field.
   The launch was scheduled for 3:28 p.m. Sunday from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station.
   The leak was caused by a liquid helium vent duct used for engine
chilldown that separated in the interstage adapter, the area
between the rocket booster and its upper stage, said Jack Isabel, a
spokesman for rocket builder General Dynamics. The vent duct was
removed, and workers planned to replace it with a new one, he said.
   ``We don't know what made it separate,'' Isabel said.
   ``We are looking forward to a launch attempt,'' he said. ``We're
very proud of what's out there.''
   The leak was not related to helium line damage in June that
produced two small holes in the interstage adapter, Isabel said.
Helium is needed to chill the rocket's main engines and pressurize
the main propulsion system.
   The leak was detected less than an hour before liftoff Friday
afternoon, as the commercial Atlas 1 rocket was being fueled. The
escaping liquid helium was overchilling another chemical,
hydrazine, which is used for steering the rocket's upper stage.
   The launch already was an hour late because of an unrelated
problem with a compressor that furnishes gaseous nitrogen to the
rocket to cool the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite.
   The $189 million satellite, a joint program of NASA and the
Defense Department, was to have been deployed in 1987 from space
shuttle Challenger. The mission was put on hold after Challenger
exploded in 1986.
   To ensure a quicker launch, NASA and the Air Force had it
redesigned to fit into the $65 million Atlas.
   The 2-ton satellite contains 24 chemical-filled canisters that
will be ejected over the next year, starting in September. The
released chemicals will be ionized by the sun's ultraviolet rays
and create large, glowing clouds.
   The clouds will spread along Earth's magnetic field lines,
making them visible to the naked eye.

   Saudi Arabia and China announced
Sunday that they have established full diplomatic relations. It is
the first time the Islamic kingdom has recognized a Communist
nation.
   In their joint statement in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, the
foreign ministers of both countries said that their countries will
exchange ambassadors. Saudi Arabia said it recognized the People's
Republic of China as the exclusive representative of the Chinese
people.
   Taiwan's foreign minister, Fredrick Chien, predicted the
announcement on Saturday and said the Arab kingdom would end its
relations with Taipei simultaneously.
   Chien accused Beijing of using ``silver bullet diplomacy'' to
win Saudi recognition, claiming the Communist government offered
the Saudis a discount of $710 million on a weapons sale worth $6.6
billion that included intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
   It marked the first time Saudi Arabia, a theocratic Islamic
kingdom, has recognized a Communist government. For years, the
Saudi government has considered Communism a form of atheism.
   The upgrading of relations was delayed by the Chinese
pro-democracy uprising that was crushed by Beijing in spring 1989.
The Chinese crackdown prompted an international outcry that left
China diplomatically isolated for many months afterward.
   The communique announcing diplomatic ties was issued at 12:18
a.m. Sunday and distributed by the offical Saudi news agency.
   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua said Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud
al-Faisal had jointly announced the decision.
   The upgrading of relations is expected to smooth the way for the
Saudis to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
   Saudi Arabia has trade relations with the Chinese and the
Soviets, but relations with Beijing improved dramatically in 1986
when China sold the Saudis long-range missiles capable of reaching
both Israel and Iran.
   The deal was disclosed in early 1988. Both Saudi Arabia and
China have said nuclear weaponry was not involved.
   In Taipei, Chien accused Beijing of trying to isolate Taiwan
diplomatically and of threatening to use force against the island.
   Taipei newspapers reported Saturday that Riyadh had rejected a
request by Taipei's Nationalist Chinese government that the Arab
kingdom not end its formal relations with Taiwan when it
established ties with Beijing.
   The Saudi decision drops to 27 the number of nations recognizing
the Nationalist government, while 136 countries now have diplomatic
ties with Beijing.
   The Nationalists, who lost the Chinese civil war in 1949, say
they are China's legitimate rulers.

   Dr. Karl A. Menninger was eulogized Saturday
as the man who brought psychiatry out of the ``snake pit'' era and
gave new hope to the mentally ill.
   About 1,000 people, including Gov. Mike Hayden and U.S. Rep. Jim
Slattery, D-Kan., packed the First Presbyterian Church for services
for the famed psychiatrist, who died Wednesday of abdominal cancer.
He would have been 97 on Sunday.
   ``If anything can be said about the Menninger era in psychiatry,
which spans the entire history of psychiatry, it is that it has
ushered in a new day of hope for those who were otherwise sealed in
prisons of darkness,'' said the church's pastor, the Rev. W. James
Richards.
   Menninger, once hailed by the American Psychiatric Association
as the nation's greatest living psychiatrist, pushed psychiatry
into the American mainstream and for more than six decades worked
for compassionate treatment of the mentally ill.
   Richards said Menninger helped modernize mental hospitals that
had been ``snake pits,'' challenged people to think and taught them
to have hope.
   ``He said the Apostle Paul was wrong, that the greatest of
faith, hope and love was not love, but hope,'' said Richards.
   Richards recalled his first Christmas as pastor in 1984, when
Menninger was 91. Young church members had included Menninger on a
list of people whose houses they planned to serenade with carols.
   ``But Dr. Karl was not home that evening,'' Richards said. ``He
was having Christmas dinner with the prisoners at the county jail.
He cared, not only for those imprisoned by their minds, but those
in literal prisons and jails, too, and wrote about the crime of
punishment.''
   The half-hour funeral service was conducted in the church where
Menninger's mother, Flo, taught Bible classes and which Menninger
attended all his life. A stained glass window above the altar is
dedicated to her memory.
   Menninger was buried in a mausoleum at Mount Hope Cemetery in
southwest Topeka, which also contains the grave of former Gov. Alf
M. Landon.

   The air was filled with chokecherries
Saturday during the second annual chokecherry spitting contest held
as part of this small central Nebraska town's Chokecherry Jamboree.
   Jerry Davenport of Sargent, who let fly with a spit of 30 feet,

   The winner of the first William Faulkner
imitation contest gets feted here next week after besting such
entries as ``As I Lay Dieting,'' and ``The Salt and the Fury.''
   ``There are so many frustrated writers out there who read
Faulkner,'' said Dean Faulkner Wells, niece of the late author, who
coordinated the first contest. ``I think most of the people who
entered just had a whale of a good time.''
   The winner _ Saul Rosenberg, a New York graduate student _
penned his entry one day before the Feb. 1 deadline. ``Delta
Faulkner'' topped nearly 650 other entries in the contest.
   ``I always do things at the last minute. I just kind of sat down
and wrote what came out,'' Rosenberg said in an interview. ``I
wrote it on a beat-up typrewriter which Faulkner would have liked.''
   The 26-year-old London native will visit Oxford, Miss., during
the University of Mississippi Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference
beginning July 29, and will be honored in a Southern ceremony at
Faulkner's home.
   His winning entry was about the contest itself. Here's a part of
it, complete with punctuation or lack thereof:
   ``They came that year as they had come the year before and would
come again the year after; the editors and publishers and critics
good bad and indifferent but mostly indifferent and some just to
say oh yes the faulkner conference I made one and even the
representatives of an airline who had come to award a prize on the
lawn of the stillupkept colonial mansion to that one who man woman
or child could write as well as he could when he didnt and wise too
not because it was easy (it wasnt) and not because it would do
their airline any good (it wouldnt) but at least it was possible
because heaven help anyone who thought he or she could write as
well as he could when he did; the mansion upkept still though the
very bones of its erstwhile owner (himself owner and proprietor too
of that two thousand four hundred square miles of land more famous
than any actual or apocryphal in the whole peopled continent) which
had held together long enough to support the spirit that produced
the work in what agony what sweat had long since returned to the
annealing immemorial dust.''
   Rosenberg said the trip, his first south of the Mason-Dixon
Line, should be ``a great experience.''
   ``I think they liked mine because it was sort of a tribute to
Faulkner,'' he said.
   Faulkner himself would have enjoyed the attempts of the
contestants, said his niece.
   ``I think he would have laughed out loud. It's a gas,'' she
said. ``It's like they were just waiting for something like this to
open up for them to play with.''
   Among the offerings were ``As I Lay Dieting,'' ``A Wal-Mart For
Jefferson,'' and ``The Salt and the Fury.''
   ``There is such an innate compliment there _ that people all
over the world would try to imitate him,'' Wells said.
   Faulkner, winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, died in 1962.
   ``I've been reading Faulkner for years. I just thought it would
be a shame if I didn't do to it,'' Rosenberg said. He called his
win ``all kind of astounding.''
   Rosenberg, who also wins a trip anywhere American Airlines
flies, says he might go to Hawaii. But the Mississippi trip isn't
bad, he says. ``I don't know which one is the real prize.''
   The contest follows the now-defunct Ernest Hemingway Write-Alike
competition. The top 50 finalists, which include several
Mississippians, will have their work published.

<HEAD>Seven-Personality Insanity Defense Upheld</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who contends she didn't commit
two bank holdups because another one of her seven personalities was
in control will be allowed to present her unusual insanity defense,
a judge ruled.
   Juanita Maxwell claims she had no way to prevent the 1988
robberies because an alternate personality named ``Wanda'' pulled
them off, and that she should be acquitted by reason of insanity.
   Mrs. Maxwell, 34, used a similar defense to win acquittal in a
1979 murder case.
   Circuit Judge R. Grable Stoutamire's ruling Friday came after
pretrial arguments in April in which prosecutors blasted the
defense. The ruling sets the stage for a trial scheduled to begin
July 31.
   Prosecutors had argued that it didn't matter whether Mrs.
Maxwell knew of the robberies. They said what did matter was
whether Wanda knew right from wrong when she held up two First
Florida bank branches.
   Florida's insanity standard applies only to defendants whose
mental problems cloud their ability to tell right from wrong. If
Wanda did know right from wrong, prosecutors reasoned, Mrs. Maxwell
should not be allowed to present the insanity defense at her trial.
   Jurors will have to decide where criminal accountablity lies
when seven distinct personalities claim one body. Experts will be
called to explain the forces that cause a personality to fracture.
   In Mrs. Maxwell's case, her subconscious created numerous
personalities in response to an abusive childhood, her therapists
have said. The personalities range from the flirtatious and
sophisticated Jennifer to the protective but sometimes violent
Wanda.
   Mrs. Maxwell claims Wanda turned to bank robbery so she could
help support Mrs. Maxwell's three children in Ohio.
   It was Wanda who bludgeoned a 73-year-old Fort Myers woman to
death during a squabble in 1979 over a ballpoint pen.
   In that case, a judge acquitted Mrs. Maxwell of murder by reason
of insanity, and sent her to a state psychiatric hospital for
treatment.
   Mrs. Maxwell was released in 1987 after state officials decided
she was mentally competent.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat came under sharp
attack in state-owned newspapers Saturday, signaling a new chill in
relations between the Palestinian group and Egypt.
   The articles, written by three of Egypt's top journalists,
appeared after the Palestine Liberation Organization leader accused
Egypt of being subservient to the United States.
   The criticism centers on remarks that Arafat made in a speech to
an Arab League meeting last weekend in Tunis, Tunisia.
   Meanwhile, the PLO's representative in Cairo told The Associated
Press that Arafat might call off a visit to Egypt on Sunday because
of the dispute.
   ``The visit is now being reconsidered in light of the latest
developments,'' said Saeed Kamal, the PLO representative, referring
to the newspaper attacks on Arafat.
   ``I do not know now if it will take place.''
   Arafat had planned to attend a rally in Cairo for the 38th
anniversary of the coup in which the Egyptian army overthrew the
monarchy.
   Government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
rift would not affect Cairo's support of the PLO in future Middle
East peace moves.
   In past regional peace efforts, Egypt has served as the
principal conduit for exchanges between the PLO on one hand and
Israel and the United States on the other.
   The United States established its own direct dialogue with the
PLO in December 1988 after Arafat renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist. That dialogue was suspended by
the Bush administration last month after the PLO failed to
discipline the guerrilla group responsible for a foiled seaborne
raid on Israel.
   Egyptian government officials on Thursday said Cairo resented
critical remarks made by Arafat at the meeting of the Arab League
Council in Tunis.
   Accounts of Arafat's criticism of Egypt at the Tunis meeting
were published in Cairo newspapers Thursday in what officials
acknowledged was a government leak.
   The reports said Arafat lamented the absence of Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid at the ministerial-level meeting.
Abdel-Meguid was busy in Egypt at the time with a visit by Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
   The newspaper reports said Arafat suggested in his council
speech that Egypt was subservient to the United States, even though
Washington was stingy in its aid to Cairo, while generously
assisting Israel.
   On Saturday, columnist Anis Mansour wrote in the leading
newspaper, Al-Ahram, that Egyptians were not eager to see Arafat
and others return to Cairo when the Arab League moves its
headquarters back to the Egyptian capital.
   Mansour wrote that Egyptians hate the fact that the former Arab
League building is 100 meters from the Nile River because the
distance makes ``it difficult for them to throw the building into
the Nile to avoid seeing your faces.''
   The League headquarters moved from Cairo to Tunis in 1979 after
Egypt's membership was suspended for signing a peace treaty with
Israel. Last year, the suspension was lifted and the headquarters
is to move back to Cairo this fall.
   Samir Ragab, board chairman of the newspaper Al-Gomhouria, wrote
a commentary accusing the PLO of seeking to ``abort Egypt's
pan-Arab role.''

   Gov. Jim Florio, standing near New
Jersey's most polluted waterway Saturday, signed into law a package
of bills designed to combat water pollution and which would
penalize violators by up to $10 million.
   The governor signed the six bills at the Elizabeth Marina on the
Arthur Kill, a shipping channel separating New Jersey from New York
City into which 40,000 gallons of oil spilled Wednesday.
   More than 1 million gallons of oil have spilled into the Kill
and nearby Kill Van Kull this year.
   ``It's not going to be business as usual any more,'' said
Florio, flanked by legislators who sponsored the measures. ``These
laws carry a very simple message, `You spill, you pay.'''
   Assemblyman Robert Smith, a sponsor of the one of the bills,
said there is ``an attitude among many corporate executives in the
oil industry that it is cheaper to pollute than to take
responsible, preventative actions.''
   The executive director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council, an
industry group, issued a statement saying oil companies shared
Florio's and the Legislature's concern about oil spills.
   ``Many of the measures are already being implemented,'' said
James E. Benton. ``However, legislation that would impose a $10
million fine for major spills could ultimately have a detrimental
impact on energy supplies during periods of peak demand, consumer
prices, and jobs in New Jersey.''
   Florio dismissed concerns about a loss of jobs.
   ``The question is costs versus costs. The status quo in this
process is not cost free. It costs each and every person,'' Florio
said. ``One of the spills resulted in parts of the Jersey Shore
being closed. Anyone who thinks that is cost free, they are
misled.''
   The new laws, which take effect over the next two years, would:
   _ require protective booms be placed in the water whenever there
is a transfer of oil or hazardous liquid from ship to shore or ship
to ship;
   _ impose tougher standards on companies storing and transferring
hazardous substances;
   _ require all pipelines in New Jersey to be mapped and
registered;
   _ mandate special lighting be in place whenever pipeline
transfers are done at night.
   The last two provisions grew out of the Exxon pipeline rupture
on Jan. 1 that spewed more 567,000 gallons of home heating oil into
the Arthur Kill. A Coast Guard investigation concluded in part that
the spill was so extensive because workers were pumping oil through
the pipeline at night and could not tell it was leaking into the
waterway.
   If spills do occur, the new laws also pose tougher penalties of
up to $10 million for spills of 100,000 gallons or more of a
hazardous substance. The penalties would apply to any spills that
reach New Jersey waters or lands, regardless of where they
originate.
   Companies would not be able to deduct the costs of cleanups or
fines from state taxes under the new laws.
   The state Department of Environmental Protection would also be
able to assess civil penalties directly, rather than having to go
to court to collect. Billable costs would be expanded to include
the cost of restoring or replacing personal property, lost income
resulting from damage caused by a spill, and the cost of repairing
or replacing damaged and destroyed natural resources.
   The previous law provided only for penalties of up to $50,000 a
day and did not take into account the size of the spill.

   Exhibits at the new Richard M. Nixon
Library &amp; Birthplace include a heavily edited version of the
``smoking gun'' tape, but a Nixon aide said the ``most
incriminating portions'' have not been deleted.
   Other exhibits on the Watergate investigation that led to
Nixon's resignation take jabs at some Nixon critics. Text
accompanying part of the museum's exhibit says the late Sen. Sam
Ervin, D-N.C., who chaired the Senate investigation of Watergate,
suffered ``partisan bias.''
   In addition, the display includes a quote accusing
then-Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of
``offering bribes, illegally gaining access to telephone numbers
and talking to members of the grand jury'' during their Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporting of the story.
   The display attributes the quote to an unidentified ``scholar.''
The quote is contained in a book by Stanley I. Kutler of the
University of Wisconsin, who said Friday he simply recounted what
others had said at the time.
   ``Nixon is blaming the media and everyone else for his troubles
while Watergate was his own doing and that of his aides,'' Kutler
told the Los Angeles Times on Friday. ``The media simply reported
the investigations of properly constituted legal authorities.''
   The library, which opened to the public Friday, offers a
cut-down version of the White House recording involving Nixon and
his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. The library had said excerpts
would be played for visitors.
   Nixon aide John Taylor said Saturday that the library ``isolated
the most incriminating portions ... and did not edit within those
incriminating portions.''
   On the June 23, 1972, ``smoking gun'' tape, Nixon approved a
plan to have the CIA tell the FBI to drop its investigation of the
break-in at the offices of Democratic National Chairman Lawrence
O'Brien at the Watergate complex.
   The library's version of the tape offers portions of the talk
punctuated with a narration of explanations for Nixon's comments.
It concludes with Nixon reading a diary entry describing later
events.
   ``It is not a distortion,'' Taylor said. ``The real distortion
would be to include a transcript without narration. We narrate, as
with every other exhibit.'' He described the action as a
``documentary approach.''
   The full tape would have run too long, taking up too much time
for those touring the library, Taylor said.
   An accompanying text display concedes that ``Nixon himself has
said he made inexcusable misjudgments during Watergate.''
   In a museum film highlighting Nixon's career, a narrator says
Nixon ``knew nothing about'' the Watergate break-in. The narrator
concedes that ``some of his aides'' were involved in a ``cover-up.''
   A grand jury named Nixon an ``unindicted co-conspirator'' in the
affair, and impeachment charges were filed by the House Judiciary
Committee.

   A man admitted killing four women, and
directed authorities to a body he said was that of his latest
victim _ a 21-year-old woman found stuffed in her car's trunk,
officials said Saturday.
   Lesley Eugene Warren was captured Friday in High Point in
central North Carolina, just hours after police from the Carolinas
and New York held a news conference in Asheville alerting officials
to be on the lookout for him.
   ``His mindset is such that he will kill again,'' New York state
police Lt. Ed Grant, who specializes in investigations of serial
killings, told the news conference in this western North Carolina
city.
   The 22-year-old Candler man confessed to the crimes Friday
night, and told Asheville authorities they could find a body in the
trunk of a car on the second level of a downtown High Point garage,
police said.
   The body of Katherine Noel Johnson of High Point was found in a
car there, said High Point police Capt. Blair Rankin.
   Warren told Asheville officials he killed Ms. Johnson on July 15.
   Warren also confessed to killing Jayme Denise Hurley, 39, of
Asheville; Velma Faye Gray, 42, of Travelers Rest, S.C., in 1989;
and Patsy Diane Vineyard, 20, of Sacketts Harbor, N.Y., in 1987,
officials said.
   Warren was charged in the slayings of Ms. Hurley and Ms. Gray.
He is to be arraigned Monday in the Hurley case. Warrants are
pending in Ms. Vineyard's death.
   Ms. Hurley had been missing since May 25; her body was found
Wednesday in a shallow grave near her hometown.
   Asheville police Chief Gerald Beavers said Warren became a
suspect in Ms. Hurley's case shortly after her disappearance. But
he could be held only on charges of failure to produce title to a
motor vehicle and misdemeanor larceny of a purse, and was released
June 7 on a $25,000 secured bond.
   Officials said Warren met Ms. Hurley when he was her student at
the Juvenile Evaluation Center in Swannanoa several years ago.
   Dr. LuJuan Gibson, a psychologist and assistant director of the
center until she and Ms. Hurley left it about two years ago, said
Ms. Hurley had taken a particular interest in Warren. She said she
did not believe the two were romantically involved.
   Ms. Gray was killed last August, and her body was found floating
in a lake by two fishermen.
   Investigators in Spartanburg County, S.C., on the North Carolina
line believe Warren abducted Ms. Gray after she wrecked her car.
Investigators say they believe he was driving a tractor-trailer rig
at the time.
   In 1987, Ms. Vineyard was found in Lake Ontario near her home in
Sackett's Harbor. Her husband, an Army soldier at Fort Drum, N.Y.,
reported her missing when he returned home from two weeks of field
training.
   Warren, who was an Army private at Fort Drum, was one of 150
soldiers questioned in the case.
   Warren was born and raised in the Asheville area. His parents
were divorced when he was 4, he was a high school dropout and later
worked in construction and in a factory. He has a wife and a child
living in South Carolina, relatives said.
   Beavers said Warren has no prior convictions of violent crimes
as an adult, but the Asheville police chief declined to comment on
problems Warren had as an inmate at the Swannanoa juvenile center.

<HEAD>Vandals Spray Capitol, Other Buildings With Pro-Choice Slogans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vandals painted pro-choice graffiti on a
Roman Catholic church, a state agency building and the Capitol,
where legislators approved what could become the nation's toughest
state anti-abortion law.
   ``Louisiana Legislature Hates Women,'' ``Women Fight Back'' and
``Women Will Decide Their Fate'' were among the slogans marring the
walls of the art deco-style Capitol, the nearby offices of the
Department of Transportation offices and St. Joseph's Cathedral.
   Shocked tour guides and visitors early Saturday discovered the
vandalism, which was carried out overnight. Police said they had no
suspects.
   ``I nearly cried,'' one guide said after seeing the Capitol.
``I'm very attached to this building.''
   Church workers painted over the grafitti at St. Joseph's, the
seat of Baton Rouge's Catholic diocese. Officials said workers
would begin scrubbing the paint off the state buildings Sunday.
   The damage was the latest protest in Louisiana's abortion
battle, which has drawn thousands of people on both sides of the
issue to the Capitol for demonstrations.
   The measure approved July 8 by the Legislature would prohibit
abortion except for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or to save
the life of the mother. Abortionists would face fines of up to
$100,000 and 10 years at hard labor.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has said he has problems with some of the
bill's provisions and will not sign it. If he does not veto it,
however, it would become law Sept. 7.
   Days before that bill was approved, state lawmakers had sent
Roemer even tougher legislation without exceptions for pregnancies
caused by rape or incest. The governor, who had demanded those
exceptions, vetoed that measure.
   The current bill was rushed through both houses of the
Legislature the day before the session ended after anti-abortion
lawmakers failed to override the veto.
   Abortion opponents want to use the law to challenge the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court defining a woman's right
to abortion.
   Only the U.S. territory of Guam would have a stronger
anti-abortion measure. The Guam law, which was passed in March,
only allows abortion to save the life of the woman and would
penalize both the woman and the abortionist.

<TEXT>
   Gay and lesbian community leaders said
Saturday they have launched a letter-writing protest against
ABC-TV's refusal to rerun a controversial``thirtysomething''
episode featuring two men in bed.
   The network's entertainment president, Bob Iger, said his office
has already received a substantial number of complaints since his
decision to cut the provocative installment from summer repeats was
reported in Thursday's Los Angeles Times.
   Iger said he pulled the show from the network's summer schedule
solely for economic reasons.
   Fifty percent of ``thirtysomething'' advertisers pulled their
commercials from the episode's first run last season, Iger said,
costing the network more than $1 million.
   ``In my opinion, I am not sending any kind of a signal,'' he
said Saturday following a news conference with television critics.
``It was a very, very hard business decision that I made.''
   Gay and lesbian activists called it cowardice.
   ``This knuckling under says we should be made invisible again,''
said Michael Shere, a Los Angeles board member of the national Gay
&amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, which gave ABC an award last
season for the program it now refuses to repeat.
   ``There are far too few examples of gays and lesbians in films
or television that shows them as something other than criminals or
buffoons,'' Shere said.
   The episode in question showed a homosexual couple in bed
talking about friends who had died from AIDS. The two men did not
touch.
   ABC executives said Saturday they did not know which advertisers
had boycotted the program.
   Capital Cities@ABC Inc. President Daniel Burke said during
Saturday's news conference that ABC could not afford another loss
of that size. ``It's very difficult to run a network through the
summer with a $600,000 or $700,000 deficit,'' he said.
   ``I guess our position is that we've already run it once,'' said
John Sias, executive vice president of Capital Cities, ABC's parent
company.
   Los Angeles County Human Relations Commissioner Morris Kight
called the network's position ``a peculiar form of cowardice.''
   ``It's a fact that a significant number of men go to bed with
men in this country,'' said Kight, a longtime activist for
homosexual rights. ``We're all very sorry that they've made this
decision.''
   Kight and Shere said homosexual rights' advocates from several
national organizations are sending letters and telegrams to ABC.
   Parents and Friends of Gays and Lesbians also will join the
campaign, said the group's Los Angeles chapter president, Adele
Starr.
   ``This shows the small minority out there who are very
homophobic and mean and hateful that they can control what goes on
television at a time when people are becoming more enlightened,''
Starr said.
   Iger said the whole incident was unfortunate.
   ``I'm not saying I will never repeat this episode again,'' he
added. ``It's only for this summer. We have not once deterred our
creative community from what could be a sensitive issue to
advertisers.''

<HEAD>Birth Control Pill Researcher Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Arthur T. Hertig, whose research on
embryos helped lead to the development of the birth-control pill
and test-tube fertilization, has died at age 86.
   Hertig died Friday at Falmouth Hospital of cardiac arrest after
colon surgery, said his son, Andrew.
   The Lexington researcher was known for his work with fetuses
less than two weeks old at Harvard Medical School between 1938 and
1952.
   A fellow researcher, Dr. John Rock, later developed the
birth-control pill. The work also laid the foundation for
infertility therapy and for the successful transplantation of
fertilized eggs.
   Hertig, a gynecological pathologist, also studied ovarian
tumors, gynecological cancers and miscarriages.
   After 37 years at the medical school, Hertig resigned in 1970 to
study the morphology of primate ovaries at the New England Regional
Primate Research Center in Southborough. He resigned three years
ago.
   A native of Minnesota, Hertig graduated from the University of
Minnesota in 1928. He graduated from Harvard Medical School two
years latre.
   In 1979, Hertig received the Gold-Headed Cane Award from the
American Association of Pathologists, which cited him as ``a
physician who represents the highest ideals in medicine and
pathology.''

<HEAD>Republicans Nominate U.S. Rep. John G. Rowland for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut Republicans, convinced they
can win the governor's office for the first time in two decades,
nominated U.S. Rep. John G. Rowland as their candidate Saturday.
   Rowland's forces persuaded opponents of his choices for the rest
of the slate to drop out, allowing the GOP to end its convention
with one team and no September primaries pending _ unlike the
Democrats, who have a primary for governor and possibly two other
spots.
   ``Our party is united. And that unity of spirit and that unity
of purpose is vital this year,'' Rowland said in his acceptance
speech.
   ``We are at a turning point in our great state. Everyone in this
room knows that it's been 20 years since a Republican last won the
governor's chair,'' he said. ``... An entire generation has grown
up knowing nothing but the ruinous rule of one arrogant, dominant
party.''
   The 33-year-old congressman from Waterbury, who began his quest
for the nomination in October and who at one point faced three
rivals, was unopposed at the convention and was nominated by
acclamation.
   In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 3-2, Rowland
needs Democratic support if he's to have a chance at winning in
November. The Democrats have had the governor's office for 32 of
the last 36 years. The last time a Republican won was in 1970.
   Rowland, who for the past six years has represented a
traditionally Democratic, blue-collar district in Congress, has
moved to broaden his appeal among Democrats by putting one on his
ticket.
   Rowland's choice of former Democratic state Treasurer Joan R.
Kemler for treasurer was endorsed by the convention. Kemler changed
her party affiliation to Republican this week.
   Rowland's nomination touched off a long and loud demonstration
on the convention floor, with hundreds of delegates shaking cow
bells, rattling New Year's Eve noisemakers and popping red, white
and blue balloons as they dropped from the ceiling of the Hartford
Civic Center.
   In November, Rowland will face independent gubernatorial
candidate Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a former Republican U.S. senator,
and the winner of the Democratic primary between U.S. Rep. Bruce A.
Morrison, the endorsed candidate, and state Rep. William J. Cibes
Jr.
   Since Weicker announced his candidacy in March, he has
maintained a commanding lead in the polls, far ahead of Rowland,
who is just slightly ahead of Morrison, a four-term congressman
from Hamden.
   But Rowland shrugs off the polls, attributing Weicker's lead
only to his high name recognition after two decades as a statewide
political figure.
   Most observers, including Weicker, expect the race to tighten up
as the election approaches. Rowland said he expects Weicker and
Morrison to split the liberal vote, while moderates and
conservatives turn to him.

   About 1,500 logging protesters,
closely watched by police in riot gear, marched along main street
to protest logging practices, and were greeted by jeers, obscene
gestures and occasional cheers from onlookers.
   On the other side of this small sawmill town 130 miles north of
San Francisco, a more relaxed group of officers watched about 1,000
timber industry supporters hold a rival parade and rally against a
forest protection measure on California's November ballot.
   In the second major event of ``Redwood Summer,'' a series of
protests against logging practices modeled after the ``Freedom
Summer'' civil rights protests in the South, demonstrators rallied
for nearly two hours at a main intersection while police kept away
a crowd of some 200 angry opponents.
   Some onlookers shouted ``Go Home!'' and made obscene gestures.
The marchers shouted back, ``We are home! We are home!''
   Police said they arrested two onlookers for investigation of
obstructing officers and resisting arrest.
   After listening to folk songs and speakers, the demonstrators
marched six blocks back to a timber company field on the north side
of town where they'd rallied Saturday morning.
   About 300 officers from various jurisdictions were in this
Mendocino County town of 6,100 to maintain order, but there was
little trouble.
   Rally organizers said they'd gotten their message across to this
community of 6,100 and called off plans to stage acts of civil
disobedience.
   Pam Davis of the militant Earth First! environmental group, one
of Redwood Summer's sponsors, urged the crowd to remain nonviolent
and avoid clashes with police and loggers.
   Among the protesters' concerns are the cutting of ancient
redwood forests, overcutting of forests in general and the shipping
of unprocessed logs overseas.
   Organizers invited opponents to address the marchers. One man
who identified himself as a timber industry worker said, ``We are
not ruining our community and our trees ... We are growing more
trees than we are taking out.''
   But a mill worker from Oregon and a former logger from Fort
Bragg warned that the timber industry was using up the forests.
   ``Stop clear cutting and do selective cutting. That's the
reasonable way to do it,'' said Duane Potter, 36, who said he quit
his job as a logger to protest timber company practices.
   The morning rally was held by permission in a field owned by
Georgia-Pacific Corp., which operates two sawmills and two other
wood-processing plants here and has thousands of acres of
timberland in the area.
   On Friday, 17 people taking part in an Earth First! protest
elsewhere in Mendocino County were taken into custody for allegedly
trespassing on property of the Louisiana-Pacific timber company,
bringing to 38 the number of arrests in three days of
demonstrations.
   Forty-two people were arrested at a rally last month near Eureka.
   George Parsons, who owns a machine shop in Fort Bragg, said he
attended Saturday's Redwood Summer protest ``because they are
cutting the forests away so fast something has to be done.''
   Parsons said he used to work in the woods and is sympathetic to
timber workers.
   ``But the big (timber) companies are trying to polarize the
community so they can go out and take as much as remains of our
forests as they can,'' he said.
   ``If they (companies) were so concerned about the workers they
would not be sending logs to Mexico to be milled,'' he added.
   But on the other side of town, hundreds of people, most wearing
yellow T-shirts reading ``Timber Families _ An Endangered
Species,'' marched to the pro-logging rally.
   Marchers chanted ``Families First!'' and ``It's OK to be a
logger.'' Some carried signs reading ``Save Daddy's Job.''
   The Proposition 130 ballot measure would authorize the sale of
$742 million worth of state bonds to buy and preserve certain old
growth forests. It also includes language that would restrict
clearcutting, limit logging near waterways and require
sustained-yield logging practices.
   Supporters say the initiative would protect California's
forests. Critics claim it would cost thousands of logging jobs.
   The pro-industry rally was intended to help kick off a campaign
against Proposition 130, said one of the organizers, Maribelle
Anderson of the Community Solidarity Coalition.

<HEAD>Pepper Commission Set to Recommend Paying Medicare Charges For
Poor Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pepper Commission, a group created by
Congress to study health insurance problems, will recommend that
the federal government pay basic Medicare costs for the 3.5 million
elderly people whose income is below the poverty line _ about
$6,000 for an individual, according to a published report.
   The panel also will recommend that the government help pay
Medicare costs for an additional 8.2 million elderly people whose
incomes are up to twice the poverty level, The Washington Post
reported in Sunday's editions.
   Those and other recommendations adopted by the panel Friday
would cost the government about $2.8 billion a year, the paper said.
   Medicare is the health care program for the elderly and costs
each recipient $343 a year in premiums if they are enrolled in the
part of the program that pays a portion of out-of-hospital
expenses. In addition, beneficiaries must pay the first $592 for
each hospital stay and a portion of hospital stays that extend
beyond 60 days.
   The commission is headed by Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,
D-W.Va., and named for the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   In an earlier report, the panel outlined a plan for long-term
care for the elderly and suggested that all employers be required
to provide policies to workers or contribute to a government backup
plan for those not covered through their jobs.
   An estimated 31 million Americans have no health insurance.
   The Post said 12 of the 15 commission members have agreed to the
Medicare proposals for the poor elderly. The paper said the panel
did not hold a formal meeting, but that the proposals were
circulated to the members who responded with their approval or
disapproval.
   The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying the tally was
completed Friday.

<HEAD>More Trouble for Man Who Bought 15 Thrifts on $1,000 Personal

<TEXT>
   A man who bought 15 Texas savings and loans
using only $1,000 of his own money also bought an Oklahoma bank at
a good price despite failing to disclose he'd been indicted for
securities fraud, The New York Times reported.
   The Times said in Sunday editions that James M. Fail, who bought
the Texas thrifts with his $1,000 and $70 million in borrowed
money, was able to buy the United Oklahoma Bank, later renamed the
Oklahoma Bank, without filling out a required form.
   The Phoenix man bought the bank and its approximately $100
million worth of assets for $500,000, which he borrowed.
   Fail has become a symbol of the savings-and-loan scandal because
he secured $1.85 billion in federal subsidies with lobbying help
from a former aide to President Bush.
   He is under investigation by a Senate subcommittee that is
studying how he acquired the Texas S&amp;Ls.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has called that deal with the
defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board ``the worst case'' to emerge
from the S&amp;L scandal.
   The Oklahoma purchase involves a different regulatory agency,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The Times said that Fail and his lobbyist, Robert J. Thompson,
received especially favorable treatment from the FDIC when Fail bid
on the Oklahoma bank and didn't fill out the required background
form.
   A year later, Fail filled out the form and stated that he had
never been indicted, although he was indicted in 1976 in Alabama on
charges of securities fraud.
   The form warns that false statements are subject to possible
criminal prosecution.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the agency should have
postponed action or chosen a second bidder, bypassing Fail, who
submitted the highest bid.
   ``We didn't stick strictly to the rules,'' Seidman told the
Times. ``He duped us.''
   Fail declined to be interviewed by the newspaper.

   The co-inventor of the theory of jet
propulsion and the developer of an emergency escape system for
combat pilots were among those inducted Saturday night into the
National Aviation Hall of Fame.
   Hans P. von Ohain, Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert A. Rushworth,
Elrey Jeppesen and the late Robert M. Stanley were inducted in
ceremonies at the Dayton Convention Center.
   The event also included the presentation of awards to the
mission team of the Voyager spacecraft and the Tuskegee Airmen, a
non-profit, non-military organization founded in honor of America's
first black combat aviators.
   Von Ohain, credited as co-inventor of the theory of jet
propulsion, designed the engine used in the world's first jet
flight at Germany's Heinkel Airfield on Aug. 27, 1939.
   ``The Hall of Fame is a phenomenal institution that keeps the
spirit of innovation going strong,'' von Ohain said. ``When you see
the individuals enshrined here, one can truly say it encompasses
the history of flight.''
   The retired Rushworth, a one-time test pilot, has clocked more
than 6,900 hours of flight time, including 34 flights in the fabled
X-15. The former vice commander of the Aeronautical Systems
Division also flew 189 combat missions in Vietnam.
   Jeppesen developed ``Jepp Charts,'' manuals which give pilots
important navigational information. During World War II, the charts
were adopted as the Navy's standard flight manual.
   Stanley was enshrined posthumously for his development of
emergency escape systems for combat pilots, including the first
downward ejection seats and automatic release lap belts. As a naval
aviator, he participated in the search for Amelia Earhart.
   A Milton Caniff Spirit of Flight award was presented to the
Tuskegee Airmen by Lt. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the nation's
second black general and commander of all the Tuskegee Institute
units during World War II. The award is named for the creator of
the ``Steve Canyon'' comic strip.
   NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly presented a Caniff award to
the mission team of the Voyager, which was launched into space in
1977 to relay interplanetary data and photographs to NASA's Jet
Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif. The fourth phase of the its 4.25
billion-mile interplanetary journey was completed last year.
   The National Aviation Hall of Fame was founded in Dayton in 1962
and recogized by an act of Congress in 1964. The 124 inductees
include the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, Earhart and other
aviation pioneers.

   Herbert Nelson, a veteran actor whose
credits include ``The Guiding Light'' soap opera and the television
series ``Maude,'' has died at age 76.
   Nelson died of a stroke Thursday at the Actors Fund of America
Nursing Home in this New York City suburb.
   A native of Stillwater, Minn., Nelson's career began in the
1930s with tent repertory and stock theater in the Midwest.
   He did more than 30 live radio shows in Chicago, including
``Perry Mason,'' before moving to New York in 1940 when ``The
Guiding Light'' radio show switched to television.
   He was cast in his first Broadway role in 1941 in S.J.
Perelman's ``The Night Before Christmas'' and helped launch the
nation's first state-subsidized theater, the Barber Theater in
Abingdon, Va. Nelson was also a founding member of the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists union.
   The 1950s was marked by many roles in live television dramas and
daytime serials, including ``Believe It or Not,'' ``The
Honeymooners,'' ``Perry Mason'' and four years with Hal Holbrook in
``The Brighter Day.''
   He performed many times at the New York Shakespeare Festival
under the direction of Joseph Papp, including a role in 1964 as
Desdemona's father Brabantio in ``Othello.''
   While he worked in New York, Nelson's home was in suburban
Leonia, where he was active in civic affairs. He moved to Venice,
Calif., in 1968, and lived there until 1989.
   During the late 1960s and 1970s, he had parts in many television
shows, including ``The Bold Ones,'' ``The Waltons,'' ``Little House
on the Prairie'' and ``Maude.''
   His screen credits include ``Little Big Man,'' ``The Great
Northfield Minnesota Raid,'' ``The Wilderness Family'' and ``The
Hindenberg.''
   Nelson is survived by two daughters, two sons, a brother and
seven grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Monday.

<HEAD>Military Reform Issue Stalls Salvadoran Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Peace talks in El Salvador's
decade-long civil war foundered Saturday over rebel demands that
the government pare down its military force and purge some
right-wing officers.
   Little progress has been reported since the two sides reopened
talks on Friday. The current round of talks are scheduled to end
Tuesday.
   Leftist rebels said the conservative government of President
Alfredo Cristiani had so far failed to satisfy their demands for
major reforms of the military.
   U.N. mediator Alvaro DeSoto said he still hopes that this round
of talks could still result in agreements on some political issues.
   ``We're waiting to see how the negotiations pan out,'' DeSoto
told a news conference.
   But he cautioned that no action can be expected on the political
topics unless the key issue of the military is settled.
   ``We have been working on the subject of the armed forces, but
there will be no advances unless accords are reached in that
regard,'' he said.
   Representatives of the guerrilla Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN, insist that the military should be
reduced in size and purged of right-wing officers responsible for
human rights violations. The rebels also want a say in the
appointment of the defense minister and commander-in-chief.
   FMLN representative Miguel Saenz said the latest government
proposal did not go far enough.
   ``The government has made us a counter proposal, but we feel it
doesn't satisfy our aspirations, because it only covers secondary
themes,'' Saenz said.
   This is the third round of negotiations since Cristiani's
rightist government took office in June 1988.
   In El Salvador, Cristiani indicated he rejected some of the
guerrilla demands because they challenged the existence of the
armed forces and could be considered unconstitutional.
   ``We can speak of their (the armed forces') qualitative and
quantitative structure,'' Cristiani said, ``But their existence is
not on the negotiating table.
   ``We cannot get away from our laws, especially our fundamental
law which is the Constitution of the Republic,'' he added.
   Cristiani spoke briefly with reporters after opening a sports
event in San Salvador, the capital.
   The Salvadoran armed forces, with about 54,000 members, is the
second largest in Central America. Nicaragua has the largest armed
forces, but the new U.S.-backed government in Managua has announced
it plans to cut the size of the military as part of a peace
agreement to end that country's civil war.
   The current Salvadoran talks are being held under the threat of
a new guerrilla offensive, if no progress is made.
   The United States has been supporting a succession of
governments during the decade-old Salvadoran civil war in which
more than 72,000 people have been killed.

   Eager buyers snapped up a cowhide-covered
rocking chair, two French bronze horses at an auction of personal
belongings of one-time billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, whose
fortune foundered on silver.
   More than 650 curious collectors and antique connoisseurs packed
the auction area on Hunt's 2,040-acre Circle T Ranch about 15 miles
north of Fort Worth.
   The auction, which began at 11 a.m. and ended at 9:30 p.m.,
raised an estimated $410,000, said Carter Pate, the trustee for the
estate. Pate had predicted the auction would raise up to $200,000.
   ``We're obviously extremely pleased, but extremely tired,'' said
Pate.
   On sale were everything from salt-and-pepper shakers and
wastebaskets to expensive bronze statues and porcelain figurines.
   Carter Pate, trustee for the estate, said the daylong auction
had brought in about $380,000 by 8 p.m., nearly twice as much as
expected, and continued into the evening.
   ``We've got a little bit of Hunt mania,'' Pate said. ``We got
somebody that just paid $150 for a tea kettle that had a K-Mart
sticker for $19.95 on the bottom. It beats the hell out of me.''
   Pate said a buyer paid $9,000 for a Persian rug ``that was
probably 30 years old.''
   The 4-foot oak rocker, resembling a king's throne and covered
with black and white cowhide on the seat and back, went for $3,000.
   A bronze statue of a mare and foal by French artist P.J. Mene
sold for $3,250. Another Mene piece of galloping thoroughbreds sold
for $1,000.
   The item officials had expected would attract the most
attention, an elaborately carved Chippendale hall table, sold for
$4,000.
   Its new owner, Jack Kent of New Orleans, said it would remind
him ``that wealth doesn't always last forever.''
   ``Every day I walk past that table, it's going to remind me that
no matter how rich or powerful you are one day, you can wake up the
next day with nothing,'' he said.
   Hunt and brother William Herbert Hunt, heirs to an oil fortune,
lost more than $1.5 billion in an alleged attempt to corner the
silver market a decade ago and sought bankruptcy court
reorganization protection.
   The Dallas businessmen were ordered to sell off their antique
collections and some personal possessions to pay their creditors,
the biggest of which is the Internal Revenue Service.
   Eighty percent of the money raised Saturday will go to the IRS,
Pate said.
   Nelson Hunt's debts topped $1.5 billion and Herbert Hunt's
almost $1.2 billion.
   Saturday's auction is one of several to repay the debt. Two
silver Greek coins sold for more than half a million dollars each
at an auction of the Hunt brothers' coin and antique collection
last month in New York. An 18-inch-tall Greek vase from about 510
B.C. sold for $1.76 million.
   At least one Hunt relative was at the auction Saturday, and he
said he was disappointed the personal items were being sold.
   ``This is really unpleasant. It's unfortunate,'' said Houston
Hunt, Nelson Hunt's son. ``But there are a lot of nice things out
here. It's nice that people are getting to take this stuff home
rather than just having it sit someplace else.''
   Chris Grogan perused a table filled mostly with horse statues.
``We're horse nuts,'' she said.
   Nearby sat a bronze bust of Nelson Hunt.
   ``I suspect some family members will be after this one,'' said
Jim Gall, chairman of the Miami-based Auction Company of America,
which conducted the auction.
   Officials said some of the oilman's children and wealthy friends
were expected to buy some of the items with the intention of
returning them once the bankruptcy proceedings are finished.
   But Pate said later it did not appear that relatives or friends
were doing much of the buying.
   Bebe Sternberg of Dallas came out to the auction out of
curiosity. ``This is all a part of history. You hear so much about
how the Hunts lived and how the rich live.
   ``I don't think they lived any different than the poor,'' she
said, pointing to an old plaid green and white couch and other
household items. ``Those will make good flea market items.''

<TEXT>
   About 500 supermarket workers in the
Portland area went on strike Saturday over a pay dispute, and their
union encouraged 5,500 fellow workers to stay on the job to avoid
disrupting shopping.
   Grocery owners in the five-county area threatened to lock out
all 6,000 workers Sunday and hire replacements.
   Members of the United Food &amp; Commercial union, which represents
about 4,800 grocery clerks, 600 meat cutters and 600 delicatessen
and bakery workers, voted overwhelmingly to take strike action,
said union spokesman Rick Sawyer.
   The union targeted Kienow's 13 supermarkets, where about 500
employees walked out. The union was giving the public the ability
to continue shopping at other major stores and still not cross
picket lines, Sawyer said.
   Steve Erdmann, a spokesman for the grocery stores, said
management will lock out all 6,000 workers rather than put one
chain at an economic disadvantage. Management also wants all union
members to bear the burden of lost pay while the strike continues,
he said.
   Health care has been the major issue during contract talks, with
the union pressing for employers to continue paying the full cost
of benefits and the employers pressing employees to pay part of the
benefits.
   The union's previous three-year contract was expiring at
midnight Saturday.
   The workers, who have not had a pay increase since 1986, also
are seeking higher wage increases.
   Erdmann said management offered a $1.15-an-hour raise for the
clerks over a four-year contract. Journeymen clerks now make $11.05
an hour.
   The offer amounted to a 2{ percent increase a year, which is
``far below the projected rate of inflation,'' Sawyer said.

   A man accused of mailing sexually explicit
letters to the child star of the ``Who's the Boss?'' television
show died 11 days after drinking a pesticide, authorities said
Saturday.
   A postmortem examination determined that Mark A. Budman, 28, of
Carson died of pneumonia and respiratory failure caused by
malathion poisoning, said David Campbell, coroner's supervising
investigator.
   Campbell said Budman's death was a suicide.
   Budman was pronounced dead Thursday at Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center in Torrance, said Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hunter. Budman
was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit July 8 after
drinking malathion, Hunter said.
   Budman had previously tried to kill himself, authorities said.
   The man drank a quart of malathion, said Deputy City Attorney
Alice Hand, who was prosecuting Budman in connection with
harassment of actor Danny Pintauro.
   The prosecutor said Budman was charged June 7 with two
misdemeanor counts of sending ``bizarre letters featuring sexual
acts,'' to Pintauro, who plays Jonathan Bower on the ABC-TV show
starring Tony Danza. On the series, Danza plays housekeeper to
executive Angela Bower and Jonathan, her teen-age son.
   Letters and cassette tapes were sent to the young actor from
March 1 to May 31, the prosecutor said. A warrant was issued after
Budman failed to appear for a July 12 court date.
   Malathion is a commonly used pesticide available at most garden
shops, hardware stores and nurseries.
   State agriculture officials have been spraying a syrup laced
with malathion over parts of Southern California periodically for
nearly a year in an effort to wipe out a Mediterranean fruit fly
infestation.
   The spraying has prompted angry protests from residents
complaining about the potential risks to public health, and several
cities have tried unsuccessfully to halt the nighttime helicopter
missions.
   Agriculture officials maintain that the pesticide is diluted to
such small amounts that the aerial application is safe.

   Rock great Chuck Berry on Friday denied
drug and child abuse charges he faces in Missouri, saying he had
been framed, according to a statement.
   Berry issued the statement via his manager the day after his
temper flared upon arrival at Stockholm airport for a Swedish tour.
He created a commotion when he swung a bag and tried to kick a
television photographer.
   No charges were filed, but the incident has been repeatedly
aired on Swedish television.
   Three charges of child abuse allege that Berry made films of
nude youths under age 17 for sexual gratification. A fourth charge
alleges possession of more than an ounce of marijuana.
   In a raid last month at Berry's estate near Wentzville, about 40
miles west of St. Louis, authorities said they turned up several
plastic bags of marijuana, some hashish, two .22-caliber rifles and
a shotgun, in addition to $122,000 and pornographic videotapes,
slides and books.
   The 63-year-old musician has refused to talk with reporters in
Sweden. But he told Swedish manager Finn Johansson to relay a
message.
   Johansson quoted Berry as saying he was innocent of both the
drug and child abuse charges.
   ``It must be a sting. Someone is out to get me,'' the musician
was quoted as saying.
   According to Berry's statement, someone planted marijuana in his
ranch. That person was not identified.
   Berry secluded himself at Orsa, a small town in central Sweden,
for his second performance on the tour. Critics panned the first
show of the tour.
   Johansson said the tour would go on as planned.

<TEXT>
   The arrest of a woman who used the men's room at
a concert when she couldn't get into the women's room has generated
a groundswell of support.
   ``It's obviously hit a nerve with a lot of women around town,''
Denise Wells said Friday.
   Ms. Wells was arrested July 7 at a George Strait concert. She
received a ticket that could cost her $200 for violating a city
ordinance that forbids members of one sex from using restrooms
reserved for the other. The legal secretary also was kicked out of
the concert, which she paid $125 to attend.
   A second woman was arrested at the same time.
   The Houston Post published Ms. Wells' story Thursday, and the
phone started ringing.
   ``We've had people call that want to pay our fine,'' Ms. Wells
said. ``I had a call from a woman who wanted to know who she could
call in City Hall.''
   Houston radio station KFMK told Ms. Wells it would pay any fine.
``The reason is because she is a listener and when you've got to
go, you've got to go,'' said KFMK program director Bob Wood.
   Another radio station told Ms. Wells it would pay for her trip
to Strait's next area concert and provide her with a personal
portable toilet to use during the show.
   ``We just felt like she had gone through an awful lot of hassle
to see George Strait and we wanted to make it a little easier for
her the next time he came to town,'' said KIKK general manager
Craig Magee.
   Ms. Wells said she went to use the women's restroom during the
opening act, but the line was long and she decided to try later.
She did so about 20 minutes into Strait's performance, only to find
the line longer.
   The men's room ``would never be my first choice,'' she said.
``But I just could not, you know, it became kind of urgent, and I
saw a guy take his girlfriend in in front of me. I saw them go in
and I thought, `He's gonna run interference for her,''' so she
followed them.
   A police officer arrested both women as they emerged.
   Ms. Wells' sister, Valerie Davenport, will represent her at the
Nov. 1 hearing.
   ``My lawyer says necessity should be all the defense I need, but
the way the city ordinance reads, it says that it's illegal to
enter the restroom of the opposite sex with intent to cause a
disturbance or something like that. And obviously that was not my
intent,'' Ms. Wells said.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav
Havel has confirmed he will meet next week with Kurt Waldheim ``out
of respect for the Austrian nation,'' the official news CTK agency
reported Friday.
   Havel was strongly criticized in both Czechoslovak and Austrian
media for his plan to be keynote speaker Thursday at the annual
festival in Salzburg, Austria, and meet with Austria's president,
who has been internationally shunned for his wartime past.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker plans to meet with
Waldheim at the same time as Havel, and is reaping criticism from
the German Jewish community.
   On July 18, representatives of Charter 77, Czechoslovakia's
dissident movement co-founded by Havel, asked him to reconsider his
visit or give the reasons that led him to make ``such a serious
step.''
   ``I have thought about the dramatic situation for a long time
and considered all its aspects. The result of my deliberations is
the decision to go to Salzburg,'' Havel said in his answer to
Charter 77, as carried by CTK.
   ``This decision of mine is an expression of respect for the
Salzburg festival and especially the Austrian nation,'' Havel wrote.
   ``The Austrians are our close neighbors, bound to us by
thousandfold relationships including common history, and I
personally want to do everything in my power to strengthen our
friendship,'' the president replied.
   Waldheim came under international criticism for initially
concealing his wartime past as an intelligence officer with a
German army unit implicated in atrocities in Yugoslavia and Greece.
   He has denied any wrongdoing, charging that allegations made
against him were designed to prevent his election as president in
1986, and later, when that failed, to force his resignation.

<TEXT>
   A woman sentenced to apologize in radio
and newspaper ads to a man she falsely accused of raping her won't
appeal the sentence to the state Supreme Court, her attorney said
Friday.
   Elizabeth Irene Richardson, 24, decided against risking a longer
jail sentence if the Nebraska Supreme Court decided she could not
be ordered to pay for the advertisements as a probation condition,
said her lawyer, Tod McKeone.
   ``There's still some possibility of not having to run'' the ads,
he said.
   He is considering alternatives to appealing the sentence,
including possibly filing a motion asking the district court for a
sentence reduction.
   Ms. Richardson was sentenced June 8 to 180 days in jail, and was
placed on two years' probation for perjury.
   A Dawson County District Court judge also ordered Ms. Richardson
to apologize to Gary Nitsch in a half-page advertisement in every
newspaper and a prime-time spot on each radio station in Dawson, a
central Nebraska county of about 22,000 people. The cost has been
estimated at $1,000.
   Ms. Richardson had accused Nitsch, 44, of raping her in
September 1988. He was arrested and charged with sexual assault.
Ms. Richardson testified that Nitsch raped her, but the case was
dropped for lack of evidence.
   Authorities later learned that Ms. Richardson told friends the
rape was a hoax. She was convicted of perjury last February. County
attorney John Marsh said the woman was trying to get the attention
of her husband, a truck driver who was often away from home.
   Ms. Richardson had appealed her sentence, claiming that it
violates her constitutional rights to free speech, due process and
protection from cruel and unusual punishment.

<HEAD>Troopers Acquitted in Turnpike Beating Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five current or former state troopers
were acquitted Friday in the alleged beatings of three motorists
pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike.
   Only one officer was charged with assault. The others faced
misconduct and conspiracy charges in an alleged plot to conceal the
beatings, which the motorists claimed occurred at a police station
in 1988.
   Robert K. Henig, 27, of Toms River, was acquitted of conspiracy,
official misconduct and aggravated assault.
   Gary Tornquist, 25, of Plumsted Township, was acquitted of
conspiracy, official misconduct and tampering with physical
evidence.
   Sgt. Anthony Simonetti, 48, of Jamesburg; Lt. Robert
Golembiewski, 53, of Rutherford; and Lt. Philip Pelligra, 53, of
Flanders, were acquitted of conspiracy and official misconduct.
   Henig, Tornquist and Tornquist's former partner, Steven Waldie,
27, of Lawrenceville, have left the force.
   Waldie has been charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy,
official misconduct, possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes,
and perjury in the case. He is to be tried later.
   ``When I got indicted I couldn't believe it. I knew in my heart
they couldn't find me guilty because I didn't do anything wrong,''
Tornquist said after the verdict, which took New Brunswick Superior
Court jurors about seven hours to reach.
   Kenneth Lowengrub, 31, of North Plainfield, originally said he
had been beaten in State Police Troop D headquarters in East
Brunswick on Sept. 23, 1988. He was arrested earlier that day for
investigation of a hit-and-run accident on the turnpike.
   Two other motorists, Stacy Brown, 23, of Plainfield, and
Christopher Moore, 19, of New Brunswick, also claimed to have been
beaten. They were held on drug charges in the station the same
night.
   However, Lowengrub changed his story during the trial,
testifying that he'd been beaten by Waldie, not Henig, in a police
car on the way to the station.
   Defense attorneys said Lowengrub, an admitted drug user, falsely
accused the officers in order to avoid charges in the traffic
accident.
   The prosecution's star witness was William Sweeney, trooper of
the year in 1988, who testified he was rebuked when he reported a
prisoner had been beaten and was told to ignore any similar
incidents in the future.
   Henig faces charges in another incident. He is accused of
stealing cocaine from a police locker and using it to spike a
motorist's urine sample.

<HEAD>Trump Must Answer Questions Under Oath About Marla Maples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge ruled that developer Donald Trump
must answer questions under oath for his estranged wife's lawyers
about his relationship with Marla Maples.
   The ruling Thursday by judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob was the latest
development in the fight between Trump and his wife, Ivana, over a
prenuptial agreement the couple signed Christmas Eve 1987.
   Mrs. Trump wants the agreement nullified so she can try to get
up to half her husband's assets in any possible divorce action.
   Trump says his wife is entitled only to $25 million and any
other property specified in the agreement, according to Trump's
attorney, Jay Goldberg.
   Mrs. Trump's attorney, Michael Kennedy, charged that the
prenuptial agreement was fraudulently obtained. He said Trump
pledged his love to his wife while having an affair with another
woman.
   ``In 1986, Donald had mentioned that he thought `open marriage'
might be interesting, but that he knew I was too old-fashioned a
girl to ever tolerate any other sexual relationship or affair,''
Mrs. Trump said in an affidavit. ``He did not tell me that he was
seeing another woman and having an affair with her.''
   Mrs. Trump also says in court papers that, had she been aware of
her husband's ``adultery and philandering,'' she would not have
entered into the prenuptial agreement and would have consulted a
lawyer.
   Trump says ``love and affection'' were not material to the 1987
agreement, although those were mentioned in the first version
signed in 1984.
   ``I find that there are (possible) concealments by (Trump) which
should be determined'' at trial, Gangel-Jacob wrote in her decision.
   If the court finds that Trump updated the agreement without
intending to live up to its terms, then the court could nullify it.
   Gangel-Jacob also ruled that nothing Trump did after the 1987
agreement was signed is relevant to the case.
   Trump reportedly gave depositions in the case earlier this week.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Clint Eastwood Can Continue $20 Million Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Friday that Clint Eastwood can
press forward with his $20 million lawsuit against a Florida-based
tabloid newspaper over a report that the actor was threatened by
neo-Nazis.
   Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow turned down a request by
Anthony Glassman, an attorney for The Globe, to dismiss the
lawsuit. The judge gave the defendants 20 days to respond to the
allegations.
   Eastwood contends an article in the tabloid's Jan. 2 edition was
false and caused him mental anguish by making him fear for his
life. The lawsuit also alleges ``false-light invasion of privacy,''
meaning the article portrayed the actor falsely, Glassman said.
   The Globe stands by the story's accuracy, Glassman said.
   The article was headlined ``Nazi Thugs Put Bounty on Clint _ But
Dirty Harry Won't Lay Low.''
   The Globe reported that Eastwood had received death threats and
that a $100,000 bounty was placed on his life after he refused to
speak at a convention of the Aryan Nations, a white supremacy group.
   ``Our position was simply that to be the enemy of American Nazis
is not a bad thing. It's not offensive,'' Glassman said. ``He
(Eastwood) claims, though, that he suffered emotional distress as a
consequence of being put in fear that someone might act on that ...
that it might cause someone to go out and try to collect the
bounty.''
   The Globe knowingly placed Eastwood and his family in danger
``by fabricating a sensational public dispute'' between Eastwood
and white supremacist groups, Eastwood's lawsuit alleges.
   It could be a year before the case goes to trial, Glassman said.
   Eastwood is best known for his shoot-'em-up roles in Italian
``spaghetti'' Westerns and for the ``Dirty Harry'' movies, in which
he plays a tough San Francisco detective.
   One of Eastwood's latest films, ``Pink Cadillac,'' pitted his
character against a group of white supremacists.

   The controversial rap group 2 Live Crew's
lead singer canceled all upcoming concerts because he's mentally
and physically exhausted, his promoter said Friday.
   Jimmy Erhardt said lead singer Luther Campbell was debilitated
by unrelenting interest in the band and its obscenity-laced music.
He said the band will not perform in 11 planned concerts, but will
return to the stage in November.
   The latest album from 2 Live Crew, ``As Nasty as They Wanna
Be,'' has been ruled obscene in Florida. Campbell and other members
of the band were arrested in June in a Miami suburb following a
performance of some of their graphic songs.
   A band spokeswoman said Campbell was following doctor's orders
not to perform.
   Scott Hurowitz, the general manager of the Country Club in
Reseda, where the band was to perform two concerts next Wednesday,
said he was disappointed by the decision because tickets were
expected to sell well.
   ``We've done so much work on this,'' Hurowitz said. ``I sure
hope they come back.''

   President Bush is using the backdrops of a
nuclear missile base in Wyoming and an aircraft carrier in Virginia
to fortify his argument against weakening U.S. defenses in the
post-Cold War era.
   Bush was flying to Newport News, Va., today to dedicate the
nation's newest aircraft carrier, the George Washington. The
1,040-foot, nuclear-powered vessel, built at a cost of $3.1
billion, is to enter service in 1992.
   The trip to Newport News coincided with congressional debate
over whether to shrink the Navy's carrier battle group fleet. The
George Washington is the sixth of the Nimitz-class carriers to be
built for the Navy. Two more are under construction. Fifteen
carriers now are in active service.
   On Friday, during a tour of Warren Air Force Base near Cheyenne,
Wyo., home of the nation's arsenal of MX intercontinental missiles,
Bush indicated he was willing to accept limited cuts in his 1991
defense budget request.

   Madrid's suspension of aid to Cuba
underscores pressure for democratic change in the former Spanish

   ``It's an abrupt and historic decision,'' said political
scientist Manuel Alcantara, a professor of Latin American affairs
at Madrid's Complutense University. ``Because of the events in
Eastern Europe, Spain feels some kind of responsibility about Cuba,
to work for change there.''
   Last week four Cubans sought refuge in Spain's Embassy in
Havana, and on Friday five more, including a woman and a young

asylum-seekers and will try to negotiate their departure from Cuba.
   Cuba calls all those who have sought refuge in the Spanish,

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Radisson Hotel people are shipping in the
furniture, computers and facsimile machines in preparation for the
fall opening of the first American-managed hotel in the Soviet
Union.
   The Radisson Slavjanskaya, a 430-room enterprise connected to a
165-suite business center, is a challenge like none other for
Radisson, a unit of the $6.2 billion (annual revenues) Carlson
Companies of Minneapolis.
   There's nothing like it in Moscow, where a modern hospitality
industry just doesn't exist, often to the dismay of American and
other foreign business people. Services aren't available. Even the
concept of service is dead.
   Equipping the operation with American television, communications
modems, laser printers, phone lines, video conferencing gear and
the like, tough as it will be, isn't the real challenge. Radisson
has done that all over the world.
   The main challenge, faced before only by McDonald's, is to find
Soviet workers and motivate them to say ``Yes, I can,'' a Radisson
slogan, when a more tradiitional Soviet response has been to say
``No, I can't.''
   Radisson's venture is a joint one with Intourist, the
well-staffed Soviet foreign tourism ministry, which built the
structure. But none of the workers will be hired from it.
   ``We want young, friendly people _ people inclined toward
helping others,'' said Juergen Bartels, who heads the Carlson
Hospitality Group, a $2.2 billion enterprise _ including Radisson _
within the Carlson Companies.
   ``We will look for nurses and teachers,'' he continues. ``We
will not be hiring any of the hotel and restaurant people of
Moscow.'' To do so would mean debriefing them. Teaching from
scratch is tough enough, he suggested.
   The entire operation, says Bartels, a perfectionist who worked
his way up through European and North American hotels, rises or
falls with the quality of the people. His staff, he said, will
choose, train, motivate and rate them.
   How do you do it? Can you find the type of workers you seek?
Well, McDonald's did it. Bartels went straight to them with a list
of 132 questions, to which they had answers for all but four.
   But selling burgers and fries is simpler than operating an
international-standard hotel with services ranging from shoeshines
and haircuts to banquets and secretarial services. It means
training doormen, telephone operators, maids, reservations clerks,
waiters, drivers, cooks and kitchen help.
   Bartels and his crew plan to employ 30 full-time foreigners,
Americans included, and bring in 20 others temporarily from
Radisson operations during the first weeks. Each foreigner will be
understudied by one or two Soviets.
   The training begins with a clean slate, which can be both
opportunity and frustration. Trainees will have few bad habits to
unlearn, but they will have to be taught the most rudimentary
technical skills of the trade.
   Unlike other Radissons, in which full services are offered from
day one, the Slavjanskaya will develop gradually. Designed for four
restaurants, it will begin with a buffet operation and gradually
work up to full banquet facilities. The process will be both a
learning and teaching experience.
   As the novices _ they'll begin with little more than the right
attitude _ learn the technical side of their jobs, the hotel will
become complete and efficient. It is expected to reach
international standards within a year.
   When Bartels sets a standard it is achieved, partly because
standards he sets for himself are higher. His belief that what is
best today can be improved tomorrow is almost spiritual. People
want to do better, he says.
   To achieve world-class standards, the Slavjanskaya's employees
and services will be rated by guests on a scale of one to 10. ``We
may have to discharge some workers,'' Bartels says. ``If average is
seven, we expect nine.''
   Based on their ratings, employees will earn points toward
rewards. ``Western goods,'' says Bartels. ``Jeans, cigarettes,
VCRs, radios.''

<HEAD>Western Scientists Unprepared for Effects of Interfamily Marriages</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to delete incestuous, since marriages to
second cousins are not legally incestuous marriages, and with
explanation of researcher's methods, contentions.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As marriages to family members become
more common in the United States, scientists are unprepared to
offer counseling about the likelihood of genetic disorders, a
University of Michigan researcher said.
   ``I'd been brought up to believe that inbreeding was pretty
nasty,'' said Alan Bittles, a geneticist who has spent 10 years
researching interfamily marriages in Pakistan and India. ``We never
consider that in other parts of the world it's perfectly normal to
marry a cousin.''
   Bittles said he has determined that 500 million people worldwide
are married to relatives, typically uncles and nieces or first or
second cousins. He reached that total, he said, by combining his
own research in Pakistan and India with information compiled by
other researchers.
   ``All those have got to be rock-bottom low estimates, because
we're missing information from so many parts of the world,'' he
said.
   Such marriages are becoming more common in the United States
because people from interfamily marriages are moving to this
country and then continuing the custom. Bittles mentioned Lebanese,
Palestinians and North Africans as being groups practicing
interfamily marriage who are moving to the United States in
substantial numbers.
   Although there are fewer genetic disorders among children born
to married family members than Westerners believe, scientists have
made few studies of those problems and have little information
about them, he said.
   Inherited disorders include some blood diseases, protein
deficiencies, spina bifida, cleft palates and hip and heart
deformities.
   If parents from the same family marry and seek genetic
counseling, doctors can give only occurrence rates derived from
general population studies, Bittles said.
   ``We may be giving wrong advice,'' he said. ``We would be
hard-pressed in this community to tell them what their risks are.''
   Bittles, a Fulbright Fellow in the University of Michigan
Population Studies Center, is a geneticist from Kings College in
London. He is one of only a few researchers studying intermarriage
but expects the field to grow.
   ``Once people recognize that this is a subject that needs
investigation, that it has tremendous importance on a community,
then they'll start studying it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Makes Friends With Bond Announcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt-financed takeover king Henry Kravis may
have rejuvenated some respect from RJR Nabisco Co. junk bondholders
with his firm's announcement it would buy back $3 billion worth of
the high-risk securities.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s public announcement of the
buyback plan immediately lifted the prices of RJR bonds and thereby
made owners of those securities wealthier.
   It also scuttled any chance for Kohlberg Kravis, which bought
the food-tobacco giant last year in a record $24.53 billion
leveraged buyout, to repurchase the bonds cheaply and get a huge
bargain in retiring some big debts. ``It's his way of making peace
with the high-yield community,'' said Paul Getman, a bond market
analyst with Regional Financial Associates Inc. in West Chester,
Pa. ``It was a smart, moral thing to do.''
   Managers that handle large funds with investments in junk bonds
have been losing confidence in Kohlberg Kravis, which helped
popularize the leveraged buyout in the 1980s and won recognition as
the leader in the field.
   If Kravis, general partner in the firm and mastermind of the RJR
LBO, had repurchased the bonds quietly, behind the backs of
investors, he stood to further alienate money managers already
skittish over several KKR-arranged LBOs that encountered trouble
late last year. He probably couldn't have gotten away with a quiet
buyback anyway because of the size of the repurchase.
   Junk-bond fund managers who aren't confident in a dealmaker can
make life difficult by pushing for higher interest rates on these
securities or staying away from the bonds altogether.
   If Kravis plans to arrange another buyout using junk bonds, he's
going to need the support of those money managers.
   Another bond analyst agrees that Kravis had his reputation in
mind when deciding to go public with the RJR bond repurchase.
   ``One of their marketing pitches is simple: `We don't mess
around with bondholders. Give us 100 cents and we'll do everything
in our power to give you 100 cents,'' said Dirk M. van Doren, of
McCarthy Crisanti Maffei in Montpelier, Vt.
   ``KKR wanted to maintain its reputation. KKR may believe more
deals are coming down the pike,'' van Doren said.
   RJR announced last Monday the details of a refinancing aimed at
retiring more than $3 billion in bonds from two issues that totaled
$7 billion. In the days following the announcement, prices of the
two bonds, one due in 2007 and the other in 2009, rose about 10
percent.
   The bonds represented some of the most expensive debt in the RJR
buyout. They are known as reset bonds because their interest rates
are periodically recalculated. Retiring these bonds would eliminate
the cost of periodically promising higher rates to make up for
price losses in the market.
   A survey Getman conducted in March, during the depths of the
junk bond market's slump, showed people thought KKR was becoming
less prominent, he said.
   The survey asked 100 large-fund managers, bond issuers and
academics to list three firms and indicate whether they would
decline in importance, increase in importance or stay the same.
Most of the 35 who responded to the survey listed KKR as the one in
decline.
   The respondents said KKR was losing luster because several of
its buyouts were having trouble, most notably Hillsborough Holdings
Inc., which sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors late
last year.
   Two other deals hit rough times in late 1989. Seaman Furniture
Co., a retailer, was not able to meet debt payments. Bondholders
agreed to reschedule the debt payments. SCI Television Inc. faced
resistance from bondholders on a bond exchange offer.
   Now that KKR has made its repurchase public, bondholders can't
say they got a raw deal from the firm, van Doren said.
   ``They (KKR) feel that's valuable. To be honest, in this
business it's very valuable,'' he said.

<TEXT>
  Blue jeans, for generations the uniform of rebels
and conformists alike, are fading from the fashion forefront as
aging baby boomers opt for new _ and more flattering _ looks.
   To put it bluntly, ``as their pocketbooks have gotten thicker,
so have their waists,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of the New
York-based newsletter Fashion Network Report.
   Jeans, Millstein says, don't fit the lives of the
thirtysomething generation, which is starting to confront the flab
of middle age and facing the fact that ``gravity is the reality.''
   The biggest fans of jeans, traditionally tight-fitting,
youth-oriented fare, are those between the ages of 14 and 24, a
segment of the population that has been shrinking for the past
decade, said Dan Chew, marketing manager for Levi Strauss &amp; Co.,
headquartered in San Francisco.
   Jeanswear Communications, a New York-based fashion industry
group, said in a study released last month that total domestic
jeans sales have dropped from a 1981 peak of 502 million pairs to
387 million pairs in 1989.
   Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., estimates the number of jeans sold declined by 6 percent
during the first three months of this year alone.
   The decline of jeans has forced manufacturers to scramble for
ways to protect their domain, often with products ranging from
children's sweat gear to sexy lingerie. They have met with varying
degrees of success. Some have been wounded because they responded
to changing tastes too late.
   VF Corp., a Wyomissing, Pa., jeans maker that markets Lee and
Wrangler brands and holds about 25 percent of the U.S. market,
recently announced it will close four jeans factories by September.
   The costs of that cutback will be reflected in the company's
second-quarter financial report and probably result in a 50 percent
earnings decline from a year earlier, VG Chairman Lawrence R. Pugh
said. He blamed a ``continuing shortfall in jeans orders resulting
from weak consumer demand.''
   Levi Strauss, on the other hand, is riding high. It has
dramatically improved sales and profitability since becoming a
private company five years ago in a debt-financed takeover. The
improvement has come from much more than just sales of the 501, its
classic 5-pocketed blue jeans.
   Levi's created Dockers, a cotton twill pant for ``maturing''
babyboom men. As one of retailing's brightest success stories,
sales of Dockers went from $35 million in 1986 to a projected $500
million-plus this year. The product line has been expanded to
include men's shirts and sweats as well as active wear for women
and children.
   ``Dockers have helped offset the basic softness in men's
jeans,'' Chew said.
   Levi Strauss also has strengthened its jean business by offering
a range of styles and fits for baby boomers, who may have lost
their physiques but not their desire for denim. Chew said that
strategy has helped preserve the company's market for men over 25.
   For VF, however, diversification has been far rockier. The
company purchased a North Carolina maker of men's cotton twill
pants in 1984 but closed the unit two years later to focus on its
acquisition of Blue Bell Holding Co., parent of Wrangler jeans,
Jantzen swimwear and Jansport sports clothes.
   The move shoved VF ahead of Levi as the nation's biggest jeans
maker. ``When jeans are booming, every age group is wearing them,''
said VF Chief Financial Officer Jerry Johnson. But these days, he
said, there's ``a lack of fashionability attached to the product.''
   This year VF has introduced a line of T-shirts and sweats under
the Lee label in an effort to exploit its best brand name. So far
sales are going ``very well,'' Johnson said, and the sweatshirts
have sold out.
   Still, the company hopes to reduce dependence on jeans, partly
by strengthening its intimate apparel offerings. VF, which sells
Vanity Fair and Lollipop brands, purchased the lingerie concern
Vassarette for $12 million earlier this year.
   Johnson said VF foresees growth of 10 percent annually in
intimate apparel and is seeking to acquire ``additional brands or
trademarks in that area.''
   Analyst Bronston predicted intimate apparel will account for 15
percent of VF's estimated 1991 sales of $2.73 billion, up from the
current 13 percent, while jeans will bring in 53 percent of annual
revenue, down from the current 55 percent.
   Many experts said jeans makers are hoping to strengthen their
dungaree business by exporting. While interest may be waning in the
United States, jeans still retain considerable allure in the Soviet
Union, parts of Europe and in the Far East.
   Levi's Chew said last year international sales accounted for
roughly a third of the company's $3.6 billion in revenue, up from
about 20 percent from five years ago.
   But Levi's strategists also say the U.S. market can't be
ignored. The average American teen-ager still buys four to six
pairs of jeans a year. So Levi's is spending heavily on a fresh
advertising campaign directed by and featuring Spike Lee, acclaimed
director of ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Designer jeans, from Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt and others,
are partly responsible for expanding the acceptance of blue jeans
as appropriate dress for many occasions. But even at their peak in
1984, designer products accounted for less than 4 percent of the
total blue jean market, Levi's Chew said.
   Nonetheless, some designer labels have managed to adapt to a
changing marketplace. Guess? Inc., for example, which sells a basic
$56, 3-zip jean (one zipper on the fly, one on each ankle because
the pants are so tight), continues to drum up interest in its
broader array of clothes.
   Expensive skin-tight jeans were the cornerstone product when
Guess? was founded in 1981. But the company now sells everything
from miniskirts and suede cowboy shoes to fragrances and eyewear in
an effort to ``capture the customer who has needs other than
denim,'' said spokeswoman Leah Levy.
   The company is pushing its new Georges Marciano line of career
clothes for women, which appear in stand-alone boutiques in several
major department stores.
   Still, Guess? derives about 80 percent of its estimated $400
million in annual sales from the denim collection. Rather than
allow its fortunes to rest on a single jean design, Guess?
continues to push ahead.
   This fall the silhouette of Guess? jeans change dramatically _
from excruciatingly tight to very baggy, ``anti-fit'' pants. Levy
said part of the reasoning behind the shift is that today's jeans
``don't have to fit.''

<HEAD>Slide In Pork Belly Futures Greased By Soft Bacon Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether it's anti-fat health consciousness or the popularity of
fast food, for some reason the BLT seems to be losing stature as an
icon of the American summer sandwich scene.
   At least that's what they're theorizing in the pork belly pits,
where futures prices have slumped from a slack demand for bacon.
   Bacon manufacturers rely on the BLT effect _ an increased
consumer appetite for bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches _ to
boost sales during the summer to a seasonal peak.
   Bacon is made from pork bellies. The supply of fresh pork
bellies usually falls short of demand during the summer, so slicers
supplement their purchases of fresh bellies with frozen bellies
that have been socked away in anticipation of the summertime demand
surge.
   Demand has been so weak this month, though, that the supply of
fresh supplies has been more than enough to keep the pipeline full,
analysts say. The result has been a sharp drop in prices of both
fresh and frozen bellies.
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill. said fresh belly prices on the cash market have
tumbled from 62 cents a pound on July 5 to as low as 43.5 cents
last week, a decline of about 30 percent.
   During the same period, the price of frozen bellies for July
delivery on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange dropped from 56 cents
to 45.9 cents a pound, an 18 percent decline.
   For belly traders, the plunge in fresh-belly prices below the
frozen-belly futures contract price was a particularly bearish
signal.
   Frozen belly prices normally average about 5 cents less than
fresh prices in midsummer, which provides an incentive for slicers
to use the frozen stocks.
   ``You need the cash market to be anywhere from 3 cents to 4
cents premium to futures to entice processers to draw out of the
freezer,'' said Paul Georgy, president of Allendale Inc., a futures
brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   ``This should be peak demand time for the bellies in general,''
he said, ``but the demand is slow enough that they're barely using
the fresh bellies, so there's no incentive for them to pull bellies
out of the freezer.''
   On Friday, the Agriculture Department released a monthly
cold-storage report that was expected to prompt renewed selling of
belly futures on Monday.
   The report showed 88.1 million pounds of frozen pork bellies on
hand as of June 30, about 1.8 million pounds more than the market
had expected. The amount compares with 105.5 million pounds a month
earlier and 126.7 million pounds a year ago.
   The situation may be troublesome to pork producers but shouldn't
last long.
   Georgy pointed out that a recent government report indicated the
nation's hog herd has shrunk since last year, which should reduce
the number of bellies going into cold storage in the second half of
the year.
   Morgan said he expects a price rebound.
   ``Sooner or later the market's going to get cheap enough that
some of the users will say, `Hey, I'm going to take those,' and the
supermarkets will say say, `Hey, I can make money featuring bacon
at these prices,''' Morgan said.
   ``At the rate this market is dropping, it's not going to take
too long to get there,'' he said. ``At least, it's going to bottom
out and we might go soaring up for a couple of days.''

<TEXT>
   Now that the Federal Reserve has changed its
credit policy and the stock market has climbed to new record highs,
what do Wall Street analysts see in the economic outlook?
   Sluggish, erratic growth _ the same as before.
   Amid all the headlines coming out of Washington and the Wall
Street markets of late, most economic forecasters have found little
reason to expect any big difference in the pattern of economic
activity that has prevailed for months.
   True, stock-market investors have reacted enthusiastically to
the Federal Reserve's actions at mid-July to relax its credit
policy.
   In a move tipped off in advance by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's
chairman, the central bank took steps to lower the interest rate on
federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, from 8\ percent to
8 percent.
   But the stated intent of that shift was not to stimulate
business activity, but rather to offset a de facto tightening of
credit brought about by increasingly stringent loan standards at
many banks.
   ``I doubt that investors will be able to build a case that the
economy will respond very significantly to this move _ or even to
further moves to lower interest rates,'' said Greg Smith,
investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``I think the Fed's moves would have to be much more dramatic or
much more frequent than I anticipate to convince investors that
much better economic times are ahead.''
   When the government reports this coming Friday on the growth of
the gross national product in the second quarter of the year,
analysts take it as a given that the figures will be anemic.
   ``The U.S. economy remains in a sluggish state,'' says the
Merrill Lynch Market Letter in its current issue.
   ``We estimate growth the June quarter was a lackluster 1.3
percent, and we think increases of less than 2 percent are likely
over the next few quarters.''
   Such assessments helped blunt the stock market's rally in the
past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,961.14, down 19.06 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.68 to 197.65;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market tumbled
13.17 to 455.27, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 3.54 at 360.45.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 166.96 million shares a day,
against 171.27 million the week before.
   Whatever the Fed is up to, many analysts believe consumer
spending, a primary factor setting the course of the economy, is
likely to remain subdued at best.
   ``Looking beyond the erratic and often revised monthly changes
in retail sales, recent underlying trends have been disappointing
and should remain so,'' said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber
Inc.
   ``Purchasing power is waning with softer labor markets. Consumer
confidence _ a leading indicator _ also is waning.
   ``The likely continued weakness in home sales will reduce
purchases of home furniture and furnishings. Spending at
restaurants and bars _ a key indicator of discretionary consumer
spending _ has been down for four straight months.''
   Nevertheless, a good many analysts believe the strength of the
stock market signals that the banking problems worrying the Fed
will not lead to a recession.
   ``The outlook for the balance of 1990 looks simply to be more of
the same,'' said David Resler, economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York. ``The economy will continue to expand,
but at a lackluster pace that is well below its potential.''

<HEAD>Bad Week for Defense Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's defense industry is struggling _
no surprise there _ but some of the reasons have little to do with
the thaw in the Cold War and cutbacks at the Pentagon.
   The bad news this past week from some of the nation's largest
defense contractors can be traced back to things that have been
going on a lot longer than the dismantling of the Berlin Wall,
stock analysts said.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced a drastic cost-cutting
campaign that will lay off thousands. General Dynamics Corp.
announced a heavy second-quarter loss. And Grumman Corp.'s head
resigned abruptly amid reports he was under investigation for
possibly accepting improper loans from a subcontractor.
   The austerity measures taken by McDonnell Douglas, the nation's
biggest defense company, are aimed at saving more than $700 million
this year.
   But that plan, which some analysts said doesn't go far enough,
is primarily a result of management mistakes that have left the St.
Louis-based company inefficient and unprofitable.
   ``This is something they have to do to keep their head above
water,'' said Michael Rosen, an aerospace analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``The company has its back to the
wall.''
   McDonnell Douglas has been plagued by production troubles at its
Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach, Calif., where most of
its commercial jet construction is done. The company also has been
hurt by losses on a range of military projects.
   Its production backlog has climbed to a record $54 billion.
While it's nice to know there are plenty of customers, McDonnell
Chairman John F. McDonnell said he wants to ensure the company is
making, not losing, money on its orders.
   ``At this point in time, we have more costs than we can have to
be successful in our business,'' McDonnell said. ``We made some
mistakes and we're in the process of correcting them.''
   Meanwhile, the nation's second biggest contractor, General
Dynamics Corp., also headquartered in St. Louis, announced a $240
million loss in the second quarter because of cost overruns on the
Navy's A-12 jet bomber.
   The company said deducting $500 million from quarterly earnings
_ the biggest quarterly charge against earnings in its history _
primarily because the development of A-12 would cost more than
expected.
   Industry analysts said this trouble was caused by what they
called the dumb but popular idea in Congress that advanced military
equipment should be developed on a pre-determined budget.
   ``It's like saying, `I'm going to do something adventurous
without the adventure.' If you think you can pioneer something on a
fixed budget, you're basically lying to yourself,'' said Wolfgang
Demisch, an analyst for UBS Securities in New York.
   Fixed-price development contracts set a price for the
development of a new piece of equipment. If a contractor goes over
the price, the contractor has to file claims and ask for the
additional money.
   Generally, defense contractors haven't listed cost overruns on
the development of planes, tanks or other equipment until after the
project is completed and those various contract claims have been
settled.
   ``But what's happening here is the government is leaning very
heavily on the contractors to take the charge and not say anything
about the contract claims,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``The company is playing politics. They're looking to keep the
customer happy even though they are paying dearly in the balance
sheet.''
   General Dynamics' partner on the A-12 program is McDonnell
Douglas, which didn't take any charges for the project and reported
a profit of $57 million for the quarter. But analysts said
McDonnell Douglas it is assuming the Pentagon will cough up the
extra cost.
   For Grumman, an important Pentagon supplier based in Bethpage,
Long Island, the trouble this past week stemmed from a broad
investigation by the Justice Department into defense-contracting
corruption.
   John O'Brien, who resigned suddenly as head of the company, was
reported to be under grand jury investigation for possibly
accepting nearly a half million dollars in loans from James Kane, a
now-deceased Grumman subcontractor who was thought to be a central
figure in a Pentagon bribery scheme. By week's end, neither
Grumman, O'Brien or his lawyer had commented on the reports.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _More troublesome economic signs emerged. Housing starts in June
plunged to the worst level since the last recession, consumer
prices jumped and a number of leading companies reported
disappointing second-quarter earnings.
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested he won't move
to ease interest rates further unless Congress and the White House
move decisively toward a deficit reduction. But in one key sign
that interest rates are coming down, interest on fixed-rate
mortgages fell below 10 percent for the first time since the
beginning of the year.
   _The United Auto Workers union opened contract negotiations with
the Big Three automakers amid one of the deepest slumps the
industry has faced in years. Health care and job security are the
major issues in the talks.
