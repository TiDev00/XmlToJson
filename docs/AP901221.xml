<HEAD>Slow Hurting of Chernobyl Children Evokes Christian Help</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

   Gradually now comes the hurt to the children of Chernobyl. As
the silent, hidden blight starts appearing, they're beginning to
get help from scattered groups of American Christians.
   ``The situation is bad, and it's going to get worse,'' said the
Rev. Paul S. Moore, whose New York City radio ministry, CitiHope,
is raising money for medical supplies.
   ``In a real way, it means giving children back their lives,'' he
said.
   A threatening shadow fell over inhabitants of the Ukraine and
Byelorussia after the fiery rupture of a Soviet nuclear plant on
April 26, 1986, at Chernobyl filled the atmosphere with radioactive
particles.
   But only lately has the extent of the effects of that accident
begun to appear, with the impact increasing with time.
   Pyotr K. Kravchanka, foreign affairs minister of the
Byelorussian republic on which 70 percent of the contamination
settled, said that at the outset the resulting volume of cancer and
related cases could not be predicted.
   ``We are now seeing only the beginning stage,'' he said in an
interview, citing a doubling of thyroid ailments among children, a
sevenfold increase in anemia cases and a rise in leukemia cases.
   ``The peak volume of sickness has not yet come,'' he said.
Scientists project the mounting toll will hit its high point in
1996-97, he said, but treatment is severely limited by a lack of
medicine and diagnostic equipment.
   A fifth of Byelorussia's population, or 2.2 million people,
including 800,000 children, ``have become innocent victims of
Chernobyl,'' the ``hostages of postponed effects of radiation,'' he
told the United Nations General Assembly.
   As the disaster's effects grow, several small, independent
American religious and other groups, as well as ethnic communities
of Byelorussians and Ukrainians in some cities, have begun limited
steps to provide medical aid.
   A catalyzing influence for such efforts resulted from Moore's
visit in September to Minsk, capital of Byelorussia, where he
observed firsthand the spreading marks of radiation to which
children are most vulnerable.
   ``You can't realize the gravity of it until you experience it,
until flesh touches your flesh and you go through the hospitals
with the doctors and see the wasting bodies of the children,'' he
said. ``Most Americans are not aware of the extent of the
implications now and in the future.''
   He said he was told 37,000 Byelorussian children are being
treated for pre-cancerous conditions, with more cases diagnosed
daily. But, he added, the supply of medicine is so inadequate that
only 15 percent can be saved, compared to the 85 percent who could
be saved with sufficient medicine.
   Soviet pharmaceutical supplies, limited and chiefly from East
Germany, were said to have been disrupted by German reunification.
   Moore, also an assistant minister at St. George's Church in
Manhattan, said that through sponsorships enlisted on his radio
ministry, his project so far has supplied $650,000 worth of
methotrexate and other anti-cancer drugs and vitamins.
   He said that as a result, treatment has been started on 400
Byelorussian children, and that by early January, he expects to
have rounded up enough medicine to increase that number to 1,000.
   Moore said pharmaceutical companies will provide the drugs for
such charitable purposes at 5 percent of costs, meaning that the
usual cost of $4,000 to $5,000 for two or three years of treatment
to bring a cancerous condition into remission is reduced to $100 to
$200 per child.
   The Rev. Michael Christensen of San Francisco's Hamilton United
Methodist Church is coordinator of Moore's expanding project.
   Paul Maxey, associate executive director of Interchurch Medical
Assistance of New Windsor, Md., which serves 15 relief agencies as
a liaison with drug companies in obtaining medicines for such
causes, said:
   ``Reaction to the Chernobyl situation has been slow because of
the incubation time before the effects show up. Churches have not
been challenged to do much about it. But it has now become a very
distressing problem.''
   He said a few, mostly local groups now are getting involved.
   In Richmond, Va., the Rev. Paul F. McCleary, director of the
Christian Children's Fund, said his group began sending aid to the
Soviets as a result of a fact-finding trip with a Virginia medical
team to Minsk in mid-November.
   ``It's a very grave situation,'' he said, adding that a
pre-Christmas shipment of medicine was being assembled.
   ``It's a very large medical catastrophe and assistance is needed
to improve the diagnosis process and start treatment earlier,'' he
said.
   ``It's the first instance of a major nuclear catastrophe,
something entirely new in the human experience. It's important that
we monitor it and track the record so if another such event occurs
we cope with it more properly.
   ``It's a very significant activity for us and all mankind.''

   Let's face it, the tuba gets no respect.
   It makes people laugh. They call it ``Tubby the Tuba.'' It
reminds them of beer-garden polkas danced by fat men in shorts and
funny hats. Or blaring bands that strut frantically across football
fields at halftime.
   The tuba is big and ungainly, a plumber's nightmare of tubes and
valves. And in the wrong hands, alas, it sounds like a monstrous
whoopee cushion.
   The derision troubles Harvey Phillips, 61, a music professor at
Indiana University and renowned virtuoso who was once hailed as
``the Paganini of the tuba.''
   For the past 40 years, he has led a one-man crusade to rid the
world of prejudice against the tuba and improve its tattered image.
   ``The tuba is a noble, regal, majestic instrument that has been
misunderstood for too long,'' he said.
   Thus it was that concertgoers arriving at the Kennedy Center one
night this week were surprised to find 200 tuba players on a
makeshift stage in the chandeliered grand foyer, oompahing their
way through ``Silent Night'' under Phillips' baton.
   Shiny bass tubas, euphoniums and sousaphones, some festooned
with red ribbons and bows, played familiar Christmas carols with a
deep-throated sound that Phillips likens to ``a male glee club
without words.''
   It was the latest in a series of ``TubaChristmas'' concerts that
Phillips has sponsored around the country every holiday season
since 1974. He also presides over annual ``Octubafests'' at Indiana
University and ``Tubacamps'' for young musicians at his
``Tubaranch'' home near Bloomington, Ind.
   He is especially annoyed by elitists who don't believe tuba
players are really serious musicians and, in fact, may be somewhat
dumb.
   ``I don't take my instrument any less seriously than a surgeon
regards his scalpel, or James Galway his flute,'' he said. ``Would
Heifetz have been any less a genius if he had played the tuba
instead of the violin?''
   When Phillips entered the Juilliard School of Music in 1950, he
ws appalled by the lack of serious music written for the tuba.
While other students were playing a Mendelssohn violin concerto or
Mozart clarinet sonata, Phillips was learning ``Rocked in the
Cradle of the Deep.''
   It was not until 1954, when English composer Ralph Vaughan
Williams wrote a concerto for bass tuba, that ``the solo voice of
the tuba was brought from the back of the orchestra to the front,''
Phillips said.
   Since then, several hundred solo works have been written for the
tuba. They include 127 commissioned for Phillips, who has played
from Carnegie Hall to the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus.
   In 1960, he said, there was only one full-time college teacher
of the tuba in the United States. Today there are 93. And next
year, the first international competition for solo tuba will be
held in Geneva.
   Phillips flew here from Rockefeller Center in New York, where
his ``TubaChristmas'' concerts have become an annual holiday
tradition. From Washington, the month-long road show of 124 cities
in 33 states takes ``TubaChristmas'' to Columbus, Chicago, Atlanta
and Nashville, Tenn., this week and to the season finale in Dallas
on Christmas Eve.
   No auditions are held, and no tuba player is turned away. Any
local enthusiast who brings his instrument and pays a $5 fee can
join the fun after a one-hour rehearsal.
   ``Youngsters love the tuba,'' Phillips said. ``If I fill a room
with musical instruments, the kids invariably run to the tubas.
   ``At a concert in Milwaukee, I asked the children, `What is the
greatest instrument in the world?' and they all yelled `the tuba!'
So I say to parents, your Christmas shopping can be simple. Just
make sure they get a tuba for Christmas.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Departure Seen as Blow to Cooperation with U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are worried that the departure
of Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Soviet foreign minister will slow
progress in U.S.-Soviet relations and perhaps trigger further
disintegration of the central government in Moscow.
   ``This is not a very nice Christmas present from Moscow,'' said
one senior U.S. official who emerged Thursday from meetings at the
State Department to discuss Shevardnadze's resignation, which sent
shock waves through Moscow and Western capitals alike.
   Despite public reassurances that the resignation won't change
the course of superpower relations, there is private consternation
among leading official analysts and more open concern expressed by
experts outside the government.
   John D. Steinbruner, a Soviet specialist and director of foreign
policy studies at the Brookings Institution, called the move ``a
severe polarization of the Soviet domestic situation.''
   Communist hardliners are pushing Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to get tough with nationalists and radical reformers they
accuse of trying to split the union. The Soviet president has
threatened to use the KGB and police to restore order in the
increasingly unstable environment aggravated by widespread food
shortages and a breakdown in supply lines.
   ``You've got the radical intellectuals and nationalists on one
side arguing sovereignty, and some conservatives arguing
traditional crackdown, with Gorbachev there in the middle trying to
preserve the union on reasonable terms,'' Steinbruner said.
   ``The middle is a dangerous place to be, and Shevardnadze is one
of the few figures who can bring serious political credibility to
that middle position.''
   If the foreign minister's resignation ``proves to be an
indication that this middle position is not viable, then that is an
alarming sign,'' the Brookings scholar said.
   A leading official analyst of Soviet and East European affairs,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``there is concern that
this is going to add momentum to the disintegrative forces, a sign
that they've now hit the central government and the government's
basically just going to fall apart.''
   Shevardnadze was a party boss in his native Georgia and a
neophyte in foreign affais only six years ago. But he took a
commanding position on the world stage by shucking traditional
Soviet ideology and negotiating tactics in search of a new role as
a dealmaker and an applicant for Soviet membership in the world
community of nations.
   His informal, personable style won the confidence of his
like-minded U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, who said Thursday, ``I am proud to call this man a friend.''
   It will be difficult for any successor to regain that level of
credibility and confidence.
   The State Department source said U.S. officials had been tipped
by the Soviets that Yevgeni Primakov, a Gorbachev adviser and
foreign policy emissary, was in line to replace Shevardnadze if he
were named prime minister or vice president in Gorbachev's promised
government reorganization.
   Before Gorbachev brought him into the Kremlin, Primakov was
director of one of several Soviet academic institutes on
international affairs and specialized in the Arab world. He has
made numerous visits to the United States.
   ``He doesn't like Americans; he never has and our judgment is
he's not as intelligent,'' one State Department official said. ``He
doesn't have the intellectual depth that Shevardnadze had, despite
his academic credentials. He'll be a more difficult man to deal
with.''
   The official acknowledged that the same might be said of
practically anyone in Gorbachev's inner circle. Shevardnadze,
perhaps even more than Gorbachev himself, was admired by his U.S.
counterparts for his candid statements about past Soviet mistakes
and his willingness to bargain for the sake of winning agreements
on tough arms control issues.
   ``Shevardnadze had flexibility and enjoyed Gorbachev's
confidence and felt able to improvise on the spot sometimes to
solve problems,'' the analyst said, noting those are rare qualities
in the history of Soviet foreign policy leadership.
   Primakov, the source added, is ``much more cautious and
ponderous, a more bureaucratic figure'' than Shevardnadze.
   Steinbruner disputed the contention that Primakov is
anti-American, but he acknowledged that no one in the Soviet
hierarchy has Shevardnadze's credibility with Western leaders.
   Ilya Prizel, a Soviet affairs specialist at the Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies, took a more pessimistic
view.
   He suggested Gorbachev is following the course taken by the late
Nikita S. Khrushchev who, in the 1960s, said he faced a choice
between reform and giving up his power base. Khrushchev chose to
cement his power, Prizel said.
   The Soviet leader eventually was overthrown in a palace coup
carried out by his fellow Communist Party chieftains.
   ``It's a very depressing thing,'' Prizel said, citing a series
of reformist Gorbachev aides and advisers who have left or been
sidelined in recent months. ``Gorbachev has outlived his ability to
reform.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, banking
on assurances from Moscow, says he expects U.S.-Soviet cooperation
in foreign policy to stay on course after the departure of Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker, at a news conference Thursday, said Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent reassurances that Soviet foreign policy
will not change as Shevardnadze leaves.
   ``Since the United States-Soviet partnership serves the interest
of peace internationally and the process of reform domestically,
we, of course, expect that to be the case and we will be watching
events closely in the weeks ahead,'' Baker said.
   That means the Bush administration intends to continue working
with the Soviets to reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles, to try to
end wars in Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia, and to force Iraq's
Saddam Hussein to reverse his annexation of Kuwait.
   However, Baker said Shevardnadze's warning that right-wingers
are pushing Gorbachev toward dictatorship must be taken seriously.
   The same critics who challenged Gorbachev and Shevardnadze on
democratization at home also attacked their liberal policies in
Eastern Europe and on German unification.
   Those policies were appreciated in Washington and other Western
capitals. West Germany absorbed East Germany, once Moscow's closest
ally, and the unified country is in NATO. The other old Soviet
allies in Eastern and Central Europe are groping toward democracy.
   It was not clear whether Shevardnadze resigned to try to stop
the hard-liners or whether he concluded that they had already
succeeded in deflecting Gorbachev from the path of reform and saw
no point in staying.
   Only two weeks ago in Houston, Baker advised Shevardnadze that
heavy-handed treatment of restive nationalities and economic
profiteers could boomerang against the aid the administration had
decided to give the Soviets.
   Shevardnadze's credentials in the United States were not
tarnished as Gorbachev tried to cope with food shortages,
separatists in the Baltics, Georgia and Moldavia, and with
resistance from the right.
   ``He has come across consistently as a truly committed
democrat,'' said a knowledgeable U.S. official who requested
anonymity. ``He said perestroika (economic reconstruction) and
democratization cannot be separated. He was determined to remain
true to that. And he was careful not to attack Gorbachev.''
   Baker worked smoothly with Shevardnadze, appreciating his candor
as well as his commitment to reform.
   ``He was in the forefront of the new thinking in foreign policy
and democratization at home,'' Baker said in a tribute. ``And I
think he that he has earned the respect of leaders all around the
world.''
   Together, they put the finishing touches on a treaty to reduce
NATO and Warsaw Pact tanks and other non-nuclear weapons across the
expanse of Europe. The accord was signed in Paris last month.
   They came close to agreement on a far more significant treaty to
cut U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines by about 30 percent overall. President Bush and
Gorbachev have scheduled a Moscow summit Feb. 11-13 to sign the
pact after it is finished.
   In the meantime, the carefully coordinated squeeze play on Iraq
is entering a critical stage. The U.N. Security Council, at the
behest of the United States and with Soviet support has set Jan. 15
as the deadline for the withdrawal of all Iraqi troops.
   Shevardnadze went along with the threat to use force with
evident reluctance, and the Soviets are not contributing troops to
any operation against Iraq.
   Without Soviet support, the U.S. campaign to reverse the August
invasion would have run out of steam by now. Baker said Thursday
that he did not foresee any change.
   ``President Gorbachev himself has assured President Bush on
several occasions that the Soviets do not intend to diverge from
the United Nations position on this issue,'' Baker said.

   A Korean Air pilot has been sentenced
to two years in prison for causing a crash that killed 80 people in
Libya last year.
   Kim Ho-joon, 54, was found guilty Thursday by the Seoul Criminal
Court of neglecting his duty as captain of the DC-10 that crashed
at Tripoli Airport on July 27, 1989 with 119 people aboard.
   The pilot was accused of trying to land in thick fog without
analyzing weather information.
   The court ruled Kim was directly responsible for the 80 deaths,
including six Libyans on the ground, and property damage estimated
at $33 million.
   The court handed down a suspended sentence of 18 months in
prison to the plane's co-pilot.

   Rwandan rebels claim to have killed 99
government soldiers and captured a number of weapons in fighting
near that country's border with Uganda, a newspaper reported.
   The rebels, who invaded from Uganda on Sept. 30, said they
suffered only 20 dead in the fighting around Kiyombe and Ngaramana
from Dec. 10-Dec. 17, the New Vision newspaper reported Thursday.
   They reportedly claimed to have captured an unspecified number
of vehicles, guns, grenades, mortars and shells.
   The rebels have been waging hit-and-run raids since they were
largely repulsed by government troops from Rwanda's northeastern
corner in early November.
   Rwanda claims the rebels are being allowed to operate from
Uganda, but the neighboring eastern African state denies the
charge.

   Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller was stating
the simple truth when he said he will still be short of troops to
start an offensive ground war against Iraq on Jan. 15, some former
military leaders say.
   But Waller, deputy commander of Operation Desert Shield, may
have served other purposes as well.
   One former government official says Waller may have been
underscoring the military's deep misgivings about taking on an
entrenched Iraqi army in Kuwait. Iraq won the eight-year war
against Iran largely by staying on the defense and mowing down
charging Iranians.
   And the view was expressed in Washington that, intentionally or
not, Waller relieved some of the pressure on President Bush to act
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein if Iraq hasn't withdrawn from Kuwait
by the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations.
   Bush has created expectations by stressing that Iraq must
``fully'' withdraw by the U.N. deadline. Now Waller says it would
be prudent to wait a month or more.
   About 280,000 U.S. forces have been sent to the gulf region,
with the buildup expected to reach 430,000.
   ``There may be great machinations behind all this,'' said
retired Lt. Gen. William Odom, ``but ... it has long been clear to
me that a March date was about all we could meet. To hear Waller
say that comes as no surprise.''
   Odom is a former Army chief of staff for intelligence who headed
the intelligence-gathering National Security Agency in the Reagan
administration.
   Lawrence J. Korb, assistant secretary of defense for manpower in
the Reagan administration, said of Waller, a former military
assistant: ``I think he was just telling the truth.''
   Korb said military commanders in Desert Shield, in calling for
more forces, are avoiding promising an easy victory - ``that we can
whip (the Iraqis) with two men and a small boy.''
   Robert Hunter, who was director of Middle East affairs on the
National Security Council in the Reagan White House, said Waller's
remarks also may have reflected the military's misgivings about
getting involved in what is bound to be a costly war.
   And retired Army Col. Harry G. Summers Jr., a distinguished
fellow at the Army War College, said Waller's comment made U.S.
intentions all the more uncertain for Saddam.
   ``It clouds the issue and it should be cloudy,'' he said.
   Waller told reporters in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday that his
forces will not be ready to go to war on Jan. 15.
   If Bush wanted to attack then, he said, he would advise the
president, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ``that until our full
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate
hostile activities.''
   Even though Cheney said much the same thing, although less
forcefully, the statement appeared to undercut Bush's strategy of
steadily increasing pressure on Saddam.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater sought to brush it
off Thursday, saying: ``It never hurts to build in a little
uncertainty about what our intentions are as it relates to Jan.
15.''
   ``I never expected anybody to go to war on Jan. 16th,'' said
Jack N. Merritt, a retired four-star general. ``What I heard was a
guy out in the field ... whose subjective judgment was that he
didn't think he had enough force to do what he was supposed to
do.''
   Summers, author of a book critical of the military's strategy in
Vietnam, said senior officers have taken pains not to be overly
optimistic about warfare in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The Defense Department has been very careful about not
creating another credibility gap,'' he said, recalling Gen. Bruce
Palmer's conclusion after Vietnam that the senior military's
``can-do attitude'' misled the White House.

   Researchers in California and Utah report, in
studies published today, new advances toward isolating the gene
linked to a susceptibility to breast cancer in some families.
   Mary-Claire King, leader of a laboratory group at the University
of California, Berkeley, said her studies have narrowed the search
for the breast cancer gene to a specific chromosome.
   Comparing the work to a needle-in-a-haystack quest, King said in
an interview, ``We're now at the point of knowing the handful of
hay in which this needle lies, as opposed to having to search
through the whole haystack.''
   A research group at the University of Utah Health Sciences
Center, meanwhile, reported finding that proliferative breast
disease, a condition known to be a precursor of breast cancer, has
been found to be inherited in some families.
   ``Based on this study, we believe the genetic susceptibility to
breast cancer is more common than previously thought,'' said Dr.
Mark H. Skolnick of the Utah group.
   Both groups have been researching families with large numbers of
breast cancer cases. Their studies are published today in the
journal Science.
   Skolnick and King said their studies could lead eventually to
tests enabling women with known breast cancer risks, based on their
family histories, to be treated even before the smallest of tumors
have formed.
   ``The long-term goal of this kind of work is to try to develop
diagnostic techniques that will allow the detection of aberrant
cells in the breast at an extremely early stage,'' said King.
``Those cells could be removed and the woman go on with a normal
life.''
   With such tests used widely, she said, ``it would be possible
that there would be no mortality from breast cancer.''
   Such clinical applications of the two studies, however, are many
years away, King said.
   In the California project, the scientist said her team studied
more than 400 members of 23 families with a total of 146 cases of
breast cancer. Breast cancer in those families, she said, tended to
develop at an early age and often involved both breasts.
   By analyzing blood samples and then comparing genetic patterns,
King said, the scientists found nine families in which
susceptibility to the early onset of breast cancer was linked to
chromosome 17q, one of the 46 chromosomes found in human cells.
   Now, she said, the researchers are attempting to find the
specific breast cancer gene within that chromosome.
   King said that even when the gene is found, it will not be the
final story in inherited breast cancer risk. She said a combination
of genes is involved in developing the disease and that still other
genes may permit the cancer to grow and proliferate.
   Furthermore, the scientist said, most breast cancers may have no
inherited genetic component.
   ``People need to understand that having a mother with breast
cancer does not mean it runs in the family,'' she said. Families
such as those studied, where early breast cancer occurs often, are
``really, really rare,'' said King. ``Less than 5 percent of breast
cancer patients are in such families.''
   Skolnick said his researchers studied 103 women from 20 families
in which there were at least two close blood relatives with breast
cancer. The studies included mammography and the removal of cells
for laboratory and genetic analysis. Control studies were done on
31 women who did not come from breast cancer-prone families.
   Thirty-five percent of the women in families where breast cancer
was common had laboratory evidence of proliferative breast disease,
or PBD, Skolnick said.
   Among women in the control study, only 13 percent had PBD. The
study demonstrates that there is an inherited component in
developing PBD, he said.
   Skolnick said the study also suggests that the inherited risk
for breast cancer, thought previously to be a factor primarily in
families in which cases develop in young women of childbearing age
and in women who develop cancer in both breasts, may also be a
factor in families where the cancer develops only in older women.
   ``Our study shows that there is a significant genetic component
for unilateral (single breast) post-menopausal breast cancer as
well,'' he said. For this reason, Skolnick said the inherited risk
of breast cancer may be more common than previously believed. It
will take more studies to prove this, however.

<HEAD>Abuse Biggest Factor in Developing Violent Children, Study Says</HEAD>

   Battering at home may do more to turn on
aggressive behavior in a child than any other domestic factor,
including poverty, divorce or marital violence, said a study
published today.
   Three psychology professors reported in the journal Science that
a study that followed 309 children from age 4 into kindergarten
showed that those who were physically abused by an adult at home
were more likely to be aggressive - or even violent - in difficult
social situations.
   John E. Bates of Indiana University said the study attempted to
eliminate from consideration all factors but abuse, and found that
battering by an adult is the most powerful influence by far on how
a child learns to cope with society.
   Included in the study were children from both rural and urban
areas, from different social and economic levels and from areas of
two states, Indiana and Tennessee. Boys and girls were about equal
in the group; 83 percent were white, 16 percent were black and 1
percent were of other races.
   Abused children were identified by physical examinations and
interviews with parents and children. Levels of aggression were
determined by a number of tests, including evaluations by
kindergarten teachers, who didn't know if the children had been
abused, and by interviews with classmates.
   Additionally, the studied children were shown videotapes of
social situations and asked to describe how they would respond if
the situations happened to them.
   The results, Bates said, shows that ``abuse predicts
aggressiveness even after you control for factors such as social
class, family disruption and exposure to spousal violence.''
   He said the study showed that youngsters who had been abused
were more apt to respond to all provocative social situations in an
aggressive manner that virtually ignored signals that such a
response was not appropriate.
   Gregory S. Pettit, an associate professor of family and child
development at Auburn University and a co-author of the study, said
one videotape depicted a boy on the playground being hit on the
head by a ball.
   A child with no history of abuse would first assume that he was
beaned accidentally and would try to determine if that was the
case. A child with a history of abuse, however, would be more apt
to assume immediately that being hit by the ball was an intentional
attack and would respond aggressively.
   Bates called such a response typical of a ``social information
processing deficit'' common in the abused children.
   The deficit, he said, would make the child inattentive to cues
that tell the real intent of an accidental act. It also would tend
to make the child ``think that aggressive behaviors would be
effective'' in many social situations where it's not appropriate.
   And, Bates said, the deficit would tend to make an abused child
more apt to assume ``that another person's intent was hostile
instead of benign.''
   ``Not all abused kids develop these unfortunate ways of looking
at a social situation,'' he said. ``How that happens, we don't
know. But that is a hopeful thought. ... An abused kid is not
necessarily lost.''
   The study has advanced to where some of the children are in the
third grade. Although data from beyond kindergarten hasn't been
processed, Bates and Pettit said they have seen nothing so far that
would cause them to change their conclusions from the kindergarten
year.
   Bates said the children would be followed through school and
it's hoped the study will answer a major question: ``Can we take
abused kids and help them to think in a more productive way about
provocative situations and then avoid the expression of
aggression?''
   A third author of the study was Kenneth A. Dodge of Vanderbilt
University.

   The mail's still slow, the
pre-packaged food is monotonous and there are few places to unwind.
The flies and scorpions have not retreated before the biggest
American force sent overseas in 20 years.
   But Staff Sgt. Joe Estes, a 25-year Army veteran, said morale
after four months in the desert is ``100 percent better'' than in
the dark years of Vietnam.
   There's plenty of griping and a universal desire to go home,
especially as Christmas approaches, but there are few serious
symptoms of a demoralized fighting force.
   The ``booze, broads and drugs'' synonymous with Vietnam are
forbidden in this conservative Moslem kingdom.
   Since American soldiers arrived to confront Saddam Hussein and
his occupation of Kuwait, only a few have been caught drinking.
There have been no reports of drug use or illegal fraternization
with Saudi women.
   Fragging, the GI tactic in Vietnam of getting rid of unpopular
officers with a grenade or bullet, is not even mentioned.
   The draftees of Vietnam and their hatred for the military
establishment are long gone. In 1990, the U.S. military is a
totally volunteer force.
   Many soldiers in Operation Desert Shield admit they never
expected to fight a war, but they are prepared to do their job,
whether it is flying an F-15 fighter, firing a howitzer or washing
uniforms.
   ``You've got a more educated, a more physically fit type of Army
you're working with now,'' said Estes, a wiry 42-year-old
infantryman from Nashville, Tenn., who was in Vietnam near the
height of U.S. involvement in 1967-68.
   ``Morale's at an all-time high. Confidence is real high,'' he
said, watching top-of-the-line M1A1 tanks rumble off the cargo ship
Cape Inspiration.
   Brig. Gen. Steven L. Arnold, assistant chief of staff in the
Army Forces Central Command, served two tours in Vietnam. He said
the Army had recovered from that traumatizing conflict and
subsequent antagonism to the military.
   ``This is as good a peacetime army as I think has ever
existed,'' he said. ``I know people are saying (the troops) are
complaining. ... Soldiers are always complaining about things, but
that's not an indication of morale.''
   As Marine Cpl. Ed Walsh of Las Vegas put it: ``If a Marine ain't
griping, he ain't happy.'' Walsh, 21, is with the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force.
   Arnold said the key to morale is whether ``soldiers willingly do
the right thing without being told and ... do it well. That's
discipline, and a disciplined force is really a high-morale force.
   ``When you have forces that are challenged, and you're giving
them the type of training that meets their expectations, I think
you see a lot of high morale. You see it here.''
   One yardstick for morale is mental health.
   ``We've had very little business,'' said Capt. Frank Mullins,
54, of Mobile, Ala., a psychologist with the Mental Health Unit at
the U.S. Navy's Fleet No. 5 Hospital. ``Morale has been excellent
from what we've seen. People can complain a lot, bitch and carry
on, but morale can be very high.''
   Desert Shield is the biggest U.S. military operation since
Vietnam, where U.S. strength reached 545,000 at its peak. More than
240,000 American personnel now are in the gulf and 200,000 more
will be in place by mid-January.
   Complaints in a force of that size are inevitable. Two of the
biggest problems are monotony and few escapes.
   ``This is a prison; you can't go anywhere,'' moaned Lance Cpl.
Steven Jenkins, 24, of Neptune, N.J., a maintenance man with a
Marine air wing.
   Army Sgt. Kenneth Hetzer, 32, had other complaints after nearly
three months in a forward position with the 75th Field Artillery
Brigade: Soldiers had holes in their boots, weren't allowed to use
the telephone and had to pay $3 for a block of ice.
   Walsh said that, despite the griping, ``we're really locked on.
If war comes, it'd be like uncoiling a snake. ... There's nothing
that can stop us.''
   Attitudes differ in front and rear units, and between full-time
soldiers and the reserve and National Guard units mobilized at
short notice.
   ``Morale was very high and it got higher as we got closer to the
Kuwaiti border,'' said Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, a California
Republican who visited the troops last month with a 20-member
congressional delegation.
   ``The more primitive the conditions, the higher the morale,'' he
said. ``The people in the more primitive conditions are the combat
infantry, the combat Marine forces that were trained in the desert,
so they know what they're doing.''
   Army Sgt. 1st Class Thomas Melton, 39, of Florence, Ala., said:
``The guys up there know they've got a mission. Down here, it's
just sit and wait for your equipment to come in and get to your
location. It's very boring to sit around waiting. That's the big
problem.''
   Melton has traveled extensively in Saudi Arabia as part of the
207th Military Intelligence Brigade.
   In the words of Marine Cpl. Carlin Walters, 21, of Vidor, Texas:
``The boredom gets pretty strenuous. It'd be better just to go
ahead and get it over with.''
   The Marines, all in forward positions near the Kuwaiti border,
and Army combat units like the 82nd Airborne Division have
reputations for high morale in bad conditions.
   At the other extreme are rear units with serious problems, like
the 1241st Postal Unit from the Alabama Army National Guard.
   ``We've got a lot of soldiers ready to go home,'' said Sgt.
Michael Smith, 32, of Montgomery. ``The morale around here's at the
very bottom. If things were different and we were civilians, we'd
probably strike.''
   For most soldiers, the toughest thing is not knowing when they
will go home.
   ``Either an operation or a go-home date is going to boost
morale,'' said 1st Lt. Bruce Lake, 29, of Newport News, Va., a
platoon leader with the 24th Infantry Division.
   With the usual GI diversions banned, the military has tried to
keep morale up with sports, movies and music.
   Mail is the biggest booster.
   ``Mail equals morale,'' Lake said.
   Veterans like Estes, who never heard a word of support from the
American public while fighting in Vietnam, are overwhelmed by the
flood of letters his countrymen send to ``any serviceman'' in Saudi
Arabia.
   Many GIs have found new pen pals, including churches, clubs and
schools.
   ``This place here is just what you make it,'' said Staff Sgt.
Jeanne Kendall, 35, of Piedmont, Ohio, an Air Force mechanic.
   ``We've made it one big party. Bring a guitar and have a
singalong.''

   The next Soviet foreign minister will face a
different world than Eduard Shevardnadze took on five years ago,
but the possible candidates are all dedicated followers of the
policy their predecessor set down.
   Most work in the Foreign Ministry and have experiences as
diplomats or scholars, the kind of training Shevardnadze lacked
when Mikhail S. Gorbachev appointed him in 1985 to take over for
Andrei Gromyko.
   Unlike Shevardnadze's crusade for change the last five years,
the next foreign minister will need to maintain and cultivate the
Soviet Union's new role as a self-declared mediator, rather than a
supporter of revolution.
   But the new foreign minister still will face Old Guard
bureaucrats in some departments at the Foreign Ministry as he
navigates new relations with Israel, the Vatican, Japan, South
Korea and Germany, among others.
   The new foreign minister likely will have less financial and
military aid to use as tool in his work, with his government facing
a flagging economy and budget deficit. And he will need a knowledge
of international economics, with his leaders expecting more
materially from its foreign friends.
   Here's a brief look at those considered prime candidates for the
job:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Yevgeny M. Primakov (pronounced Pree-mah-kof'), the first
possible candidate mentioned in the Soviet press after
Shevardnadze's resignation, is a 61-year-old former professor known
most recently for his shuttle diplomacy to Iraq looking for a
solution in the Persian Gulf.
   His effort failed after several meetings with Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein, reported to be a longtime friend. But still it
heightened his status as a savvy envoy who at least tried to deal
with Saddam.
   Before becoming a deputy foreign minister last year, Primakov
was director of the prestigious Institute for World Economy and
International Relations. An expert on the Middle and Far East, as
well as having a doctorate in economics, Primakov helped devise the
``new thinking'' foreign policy that Shevardnadze was implementing.
   Primakov recently was criticized in the Soviet press for being
among officials who received new, state-owned apartments without
the usual waiting period. But the news didn't seem to tarnish his
image; he also was mentioned as a possible candidate for the
proposed new post of vice president.

   Valentin M. Falin (Fah'-lin), 64, became chief of the Communist
Party's international department in 1988, before the party's
credibility plummeted and the job lost some influence over foreign
policies.
   Falin is considered a master diplomat and the leading Soviet
expert on Western Europe. He rose through the Foreign Ministry's
European departments and served as a Soviet attache in Austria and
ambassador to West Germany.
   He was an adviser to Gromyko in 1965, a national legislator on
the foreign affairs committee, a member of the government daily
Izvestia's editorial board, and member of the party's policy-making
Central Committee.

   Vladimir F. Petrovsky (Peh-trof'-skee), a deputy foreign
minister since 1986, has seen his stock rise since returning from
Iraq last month to find a solution to the gulf crisis.
   The 57-year-old diplomat was in Baghdad while the Soviet Union
began dropping its cautionary tone and threatening to support force
against Iraq if Saddam didn't pull out of Kuwait.
   He began his foreign service career as an English translator at
the United Nations, later rising under Gromyko. He later became
chief of the Foreign Ministry's U.S. department, then head of the
ministry's section that deals with international organizations.

   Yuli A. Vorontsov (Voh-rahn'-tsof), 61, a rare generalist in
Soviet diplomacy, worked in the United States, India and France
before being sent as trouble-shooting ambassador to Afghanistan
during the Soviet pullout in 1988.
   His experience includes meeting secretly in 1985 with Israel's
ambassador in France to discuss restoration of ties, defending
Soviet human rights policies at a rights conference in 1977, and
leading disarmament talks in 1985 over U.S. and Soviet intermediate
and strategic nuclear weapons.
   He later was brought back to Moscow and made first deputy
foreign minister, solidifying his place in a new generation of
flexible, innovative diplomats.

<TEXT>
   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh (Bes-mairt-nikh'), 57, an expert on
U.S.-Soviet relations, was made Soviet ambassador to the United
States in April in a sweeping appointment of new foreign service
officers.
   He had served in the Soviet embassy in Washington for 13 years
before returning to Moscow in 1983, where he was a deputy foreign
minister responsible for the United Nations and North America. He
later rose to become one of three first deputy foreign ministers.

   Eduard A. Shevardnadze helped create a new era in
Soviet foreign policy, marked by sweeping arms control agreements,
withdrawal from Afghanistan and the collapse of Communist regimes
in Eastern Europe.
   Shevardnadze, who announced Thursday he would resign as foreign
minister, was a novice in international affairs when he was chosen
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the high-profile job in July 1985.
   He had spent most of his political career working for as a
Communist Party functionary.
   Diplomats and Soviet watchers rushed to find out more about him.
He was fairly well-known within the Soviet Union for battling crime
and corruption in his native Georgia where was in charge of the
interior ministry and the police. Shevardnadze replaced the dour
Andrei A. Gromyko who was foreign minister for 28 years and was
known as ``Mr. Nyet'' for his tough negotiating stands.
   The genial, white-haired Shevardnadze quickly reversed gears,
implementing Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' and promoting a less
aggressive foreign policy aimed at lessening world tensions.
   Hard-working, well-briefed and quick to learn, Shevardnadze
developed good working relations with his Western counterparts and
often warm personal relations.
   It was Gorbachev who won the Nobel Peace Prize this year, but it
was the 62-year-old Shevardnadze who did much of the leg work.
Former Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov referred to his
globetrotting boss as ``the flying Georgian.''
   Like Gorbachev, Shevardnadze is a pragmatist rather than an
old-style, hard-line communist. Gorbachev recently credited
Shevardnadze, a friend dating back to their teens, with helping
develop the concept of perestroika during a walk along a beach in
March 1985.
   ``We were walking and talking,'' Gorbachev told the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda. ``We compared notes. He said that
everything was rotten through.''
   ``It was not easy for us to reach those conclusions,'' Gorbachev
said. ``We had seen a lot, especially considering that we had seen
the war, so we had seen a lot and knew a lot.''
   Together, Gorbachev and Shevardnadze closed the final chapter in
the Cold War, permitting the unification of Germany and the return
of democracy to Eastern Europe and improving relations with the
United States.
   They moved to heal rifts with Japan, South Korea and Isreal, and
cooled relations with hard-line regimes such as Cuba and North
Korea.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Soviet Union was among
the first to condemn its longtime ally Iraq and call for
unconditional withdrawal. In an unprecedented display of superpower
cooperation, Moscow has backed all U.N. resolutions aimed at
dislodging the Iraqi forces.
   ``Shevardnadze made a real era in our international policies,''
Sergei Stankevich, Moscow's deputy mayor, said in tribute Thursday.
   Shevardnadze, a teacher's son, was born in the village of Mamati
near the Black Sea on Jan. 25, 1928. He rose through the ranks of
the Communist Youth League, and the Georgian Communist Party,
became the republic's interior minister in 1965 and its party
leader in 1972.
   Georgia had a reputation for corruption and as interior minister
Shevardnadze gained national attention for his key role in one of
the republic's most infamous examples of nepotism and bribery.
   The case involved Otari Lazishvili, who used a personal
friendship with a former Soviet general prosecutor to protect
numerous illegal economic dealings.
   Shevardnadze gradually and successfully moved against Lazishvili
in 1972. He was then made party boss and continued the crackdown.
   In his book ``Russia,'' author Robert Kaiser tells how
Shevardnadze tested his own regulations against exporting Georgian
produce. He filled a car trunk with tomatoes, dressed in peasant
clothes and drove north toward the Russian border, bribing border
guards en route. A purge of the border patrol ensued.
   Shevardnadze also pioneered the use of public opinion polls in
the Soviet Union, creating in 1966 an Institute for the Study of
Public Opnion to provide reliable data about the extent of crime
and corruption.
   He promoted economic reform long before perestroika was a
household word, allowing some Georgian enterprises such as
restaurants to adopt elements of private enterprise.
   In 1978, Shevardnadze was appointed a non-voting member of the
national Communist Party Politburo which, until recent reforms,
wielded immense power over the government of the country as well as
the party. In 1985 after Gorbachev took over leadership of the
Communist Party, Shevardnadze was made a full member.
   Shevardnade's wife, Nanuli, is a former journalist.

   The stunning resignation of Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze seems aimed at revitalizing the flagging Soviet
reform movement and prodding Mikhail Gorbachev into quashing an
upsurge by ``reactionaries.''
   ``Democrats ... you have scattered,'' Shevardnadze told
parliamentarians near the end of a rambling 15-minute speech.
   Shevardnadze did not directly criticize Gorbachev. But he
confronted him with a clear choice: to preserve the fragile
democratic institutions of perestroika or to risk crushing them by
strengthening presidential powers to cope with the political and
economic crisis.
   Shevardnadze, along with Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev, was
one of the three pillars of the perestroika reform movement, and it
was not clear whether the policy could stand on two legs at this
moment of crisis.
   Gorbachev is asking the Congress of People's Deputies to yet
again strengthen the powers of his presidency. Hard-liners are
lobbying for him to declare a state of emergency and rule by decree
in troubled regions, particularly the three secessionist Baltic
republics.
   Shevardnadze noted in his speech that hard-liners had succeeded
in pressuring Gorbachev to replace the moderate Interior Minister
Vadim Bakatin with a KGB and an army general, and said he thought
he was their next target.
   Implicit in his speech was the idea that Gorbachev has
capitulated to the conservatives, an idea that enunciated later by
other reformers.
   ``I think Mr. Gorbachev should take Mr. Shevardnadze's statement
as a real signal that he is ... going too far to the right,'' said
Moscow Deputy Mayor Sergei Stankevich.
   ``I think Gorbachev should make a crucial choice, whether he's
going to continue the course he started'' in launching the reforms
in 1985, said Stankevich.
   The hard-liners that Shevardnadze accused of ``persecuting'' him
gleefully welcomed his departure.
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' said Col. Viktor
Alksnis, a leader of the movement that has been urging Gorbachev to
declare a state of emergency and rule by presidential decree in
tense areas of the country.
   Shevardnadze called Gorbachev a ``friend'' and soulmate, but his
resignation recalled an earlier parting of the ways.
   The resignation recalled the fiery speech delivered by another
reformer, Boris N. Yeltsin, at a closed party meeting in late 1987.
Gorbachev drummed Yeltsin out of the ruling Politburo - and now
Yeltsin stands as his most formidable political foe, as president
of the Russian Federation.
   Yeltsin, in his speech, said Gorbachev was jeopardizing the
reforms by not doing battle with hard-liners, a point very similar
to Shevardnadze's.
   And Yeltsin and Shevardnadze also angered Gorbachev by
surprising him.
   ``For me, Shevardnadze's announcement came as a surprise. That,
more than anything else, to tell the truth, hurts me,'' Gorbachev
told the Congress, picking his words carefully.
   Yakovlev pointedly made himself available to reporters in the
cavernous white marble foyer of the Kremlin Palace of Congresses.
He said he regretted Shevardnadze's resignation, but called the
Georgian's prediction of dictatorship ``nonsense.''
   ``I wouldn't jump to such a conclusion,'' he said. ``But there
are signs that the extreme right is raising its head, and they have
a glint in their eyes.''
   Another Gorbachev ally, Fyodor Burlatsky, appeared on the floor
of the Congress and asked the body to vote to request that
Shevardnadze remain as foreign minister. It complied, on a 1,540-52
vote, but a Shevardnadze spokesman said that the decision was
``irreversible.''

   Bundled-up preschoolers will sing carols in Covent
Garden on Saturday to remind shoppers that British journalist John
McCarthy will spend another Christmas as a hostage in Lebanon.
   The Friends of John McCarthy hope the group of 4{ year olds,
chosen because they have lived as long as he has been captive, will
catch news media attention and give a boost to the campaign for the
television journalist's release.
   ``Christmas is quite depressing, because I think April is right
round the corner,'' said Jill Morrell, McCarthy's girlfriend at the
time he was kidnapped on April 17, 1986.
   Ms. Morrell, also a television journalist, has become the
reluctant spokeswoman for the campaign and its 9,000 members, who
lobby the British government and work to keep McCarthy, 34, and two
other British hostages in the public eye.
   ``It's an uphill battle,'' Ms. Morrell, 33, said in a recent
interview at a north London restaurant. ``We're a small
campaign...so it takes an effort to get noticed.''
   Gunmen kidnapped McCarthy on his way to catch a plane home from
Beirut. No group has ever claimed responsibility for the
kidnapping.
   The McCarthy campaign has also taken up the causes of Church of
England envoy Terry Waite, taken captive on Jan. 20, 1987, and
retired pilot Jack Mann, who disappeared May 12, 1989.
   A fourth Briton, Alec Collett, disappeared in 1985. A group that
claimed to be holding him released a videotape purporting to show
Collett hanged, but his death has never been confirmed.
   There are nine other Western hostages in Lebanon, including
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and has been in
captivity the longest.
   A small woman with a soft voice, sparkling blue eyes and an easy
smile, Ms. Morrell also displays a steely resolve that gained her
meetings with Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat
and Nabih Berri, leader of Amal, the largest Shiite militia.
   By staging media events to mark McCarthy's kidnapping and his
birthday on Nov. 27, and acting as spokeswoman for his cause, Ms.
Morrell has made McCarthy's name, and herself, familiar to millions
of Britons.
   But the last four months of the campaign, which has now lasted
longer than she and McCarthy were together, have been particularly
tough.
   Britain's renewed diplmatic relations with Iran and Syria have
brought few results.
   False rumors of McCarthy's imminent freedom have been especially
frustrating after the euphoria surrounding the release of
McCarthy's fellow captive, Brian Keenan, on Aug. 25.
   Keenan, a teacher from Belfast, Northern Ireland, spent months
with McCarthy and gave Ms. Morrell a detailed picture of his life,
much of it very cruel.
   ``It was like having John back, hearing about him. He is coping
very well but the treatment and the misery and the pain, some of it
wasn't pleasant,'' she said, her voice trailing off as she sipped a
cup of tea.
   After three years together, Ms. Morrell and McCarthy had been
about to buy an apartment and were thinking about marriage.
   Now, she said, she thought that when McCarthy was freed he might
want to meet other women.
   Like Keenan, ``he might want to experience everything with new
enthusiasm and make up for lost time.''

<HEAD>Fraud Charges Still Major Issue in Mexican Elections</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When candidates and parties face off in
Mexican elections, the battle often doesn't end at the ballot box.
Fraud charges fly for weeks after.
   Four state elections over the past two months showed the issue
of fraud is as alive as ever, despite President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's pledges of clean elections, reforms in electoral laws and
promises from his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that
it's changing its ways.
   Most accusations are aimed at the PRI, whose 61 years in power
have made it synonymous with the government, thus helping it
continue to win.
   What has changed since Salinas took office two years ago is that
clear opposition victories are recognized, said Luis H. Alvarez,
president of the National Action Party, or PAN.
   The business-oriented National Action Party for many years was
the only significant opposition and, even so, won few elections.
With the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, it remains one of
the two main minority forces.
   ``Here one has to win by knockout, by an ample majority,''
Alvarez said. It's more difficult when the vote is close.
   ``Now if we win and we show the documentation that we won, they
recognize our triumph, but that shouldn't have to be.
   ``We have to prove it. The one who is robbed has to say, `they
robbed me,' and then catch the thief and put him in jail.''
   For eight days the rightist opposition party and the governing
party claimed victory in the close Nov. 25 mayoral race in Merida.
   ``If the PRI wins, (it's) fraud; if the opposition party wins,
(it's) democracy,'' Yucatan state Gov. Victor Manzanilla Schaffer
was quoted as saying of the opposition allegations.
   PAN's Ana Rosa Payan Cervera was declared the winner after
recounts and the inclusion of six disputed ballot boxes. Local
governing party officials then said they would challenge the
results.
   ``It is a significant advance, not because the PAN has won in
Merida, but simply because they are giving the real results,'' the
government newspaper El Nacional said in an editorial.
   The 1979 electoral law reforms invited more opposition by making
it easier for parties to register.
   Minority parties receive congressional seats according to the
percentage of the vote they win and are guaranteed at least 100 of
the 400 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
   ``Before, the central characteristic of the Mexican elections
was their lack of competitiveness. Today, that characteristic has
been reduced to the simple absence of credibility,'' Lorenzo Meyer,
a leading historian at the prestigious Colegio de Mexico wrote in
his front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior.
   When results aren't credible, the opposition frequently protests
by taking over the local city hall. Other times, the results turn
tragic.
   Riot police fired tear gas into a Democratic Revolutionary Party
rally Dec. 12 in Tejupilco, in the central state of Mexico, to
protest fraud in municipal elections a month earlier. Three people
were killed and dozens of others injured in the shooting that
followed.
   Public discontent over fraud was so great by 1988 that Salinas,
in his inaugural speech, said the country's most pressing political
need was clean elections.
   Many Mexicans still insist that Salinas himself lost to
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who heads the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
   Governing party documents released this month say ``the
legitimacy of suffrage is an unavoidable element of the new
national consensus. It is the final hour for non-competitive
electoral systems.''
   But Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, a Democratic Revolutionary leader,
and Alvarez allege the PRI machinery merely went high-tech.
   Computerized altering of voter registration lists has become the
main means of rigging elections, with opposition supporters
disappearing and fictitious names being added, they said.
   The PRI denies that and argues that opposition parties get the
lists from the government for review before elections.
   Martinez said parties aren't able to check the thousands of
names. When he complained that rolls for the Mexico state elections
carried the same names several times, he got a meeting with the
interior secretary but no change in the list, he said.
   Under 1989 electoral reforms, a new national voter registration
list will be drawn up by next year's congressional elections and
meetings of electoral bodies will be public. The new law sets fines
and jail sentences for violations.
   The PRI dominated all four recent state elections, its most
notable loss outside Merida being PAN's mayral victory in
Saltillo, the Coahuila state capital.
   If recent elections had been spotless, Alvarez said, the
governing party still would do well, ``simply from inertia, custom
... but the opposition would have much greater presence than is
officially recognized.''
   When turnout is high, as it was in 1988 and this month in
Yucatan, the governing party loses, Martinez said.

<TEXT>
   ``What can a fellow do with $1,000?'' a young
man asks in an O. Henry short story.
   ``A thousand dollars means much or little,'' replies a character
called Old Bryson. That was in the century's first decade. In its
last, $1,000 still means much or little, especially during the
holidays.
   What would $1,000 buy in O. Henry's day?
   ``One man may buy a happy home with it and laugh at
Rockefeller,'' Old Bryson said. ``Another could send his wife South
with it and save her life. A thousand dollars would buy pure milk
for 100 babies during June, July and August and save 50 of their
lives.
   ``It would furnish an education for an ambitious boy. I am told
that a genuine Corot was secured for that amount in an auction room
yesterday. You could move to a New Hampshire town and live
respectably two years on it. You could rent Madison Square Garden
for one evening with it.''
   These days, a Christmas shopper could buy a Giorgio Armani suit
at Saks, 18-carat gold horse cuff links at Tiffany, a 4{-foot long
stuffed tiger at FAO Schwarz toy store or 15 pounds of Scottish
salmon and 1,282 bagels at Zabar's deli.
   With a thousand dollars you can buy a 25-foot oak tree, a box
seat at baseball's All-Star Game, a Faberge egg made of cocabolo
wood, a set of AKG K1000 headphones or 869 subway tokens.
   With the same amount, the Children's Aid Society can send five
homeless kids to camp for three weeks, or two handicapped kids to
camp for two weeks. The Coalition for the Homeless can serve 685
meals at Grand Central Terminal.
   A thousand dollars would buy 20 hours in a stretch limousine;
four sessions at La Coupe hair salon with colorist Daniel Galvin;
three makeovers by Ilana at Il Makiage. It also would clothe 50
children for winter or provide health exams for 20 children who
otherwise would never see a doctor outside an emergency room.
   A sightseer might charter a twin-engine, five-seat helicopter
for 30 minutes; a harried suburban commuter might soar above the
traffic to and from work for one blessed day and still have enough
for a monthly bus ticket.
   A tourist could spend anight at the Hotel Pierre in suite 2111,
which has a balcony, kitchen and chandeliered dining room but no
view of Central Park - that's $1,100 a night, minimum. Or he could
spend 40 nights at the YMCA on 23rd Street, provided he settles for
a room with no television.
   A gourmet might invite four guests to join her for dinner at the
Quilted Giraffe, where the menu promises dishes such as Wasabi
Pizza with Sashimi Tuna and Confit of Duck with Creamy Garlic
Potatoes. Or, if she doesn't mind eating while standing, she could
treat 500 people to a hot dog and a cup of juice at a Papaya King
stand.
   A thousand dollars would cover a month in a Phoenix House
program for drug addicts, but staffer Steve Dnistrian says money
isn't the problem: ``If someone gave us a million we couldn't open
another treatment center. Nobody wants one on their block.''
   Nor can a thousand dollars buy most of the things on Old
Bryson's list.
   The median cost of a happy home in metropolitan New York is
$176,700, but a thousand dollars will buy a doll house, fully
furnished, wallpapered and carpeted, at Schwarz.
   A thousand dollars would buy a week's formula for 40 babies in
Covenant House's mother-and-child unit, but the average cost of a
year at a private college or university is $13,544. And Madison
Square Garden now rents for $40,000 a night.

<HEAD>OSHA Case Settled With Record $3.25 Million Fine for USX Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. will pay a record $3.25 million fine
to settle government allegations that it deliberately and
repeatedly violated worker-safety standards at two Pennsylvania
steel plants.
   The settlement, announced Thursday, stemmed from allegations
leveled last year by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. The agency accused USS, the steelmaking division of
USX Corp., of more than 2,000 federal job safety violations.
   OSHA originally proposed a record $7.3 million fine for the
violations, which included hazards the government said were blamed
for fatalities and not corrected. The $3.25 million settlement is
the largest worker-safety fine to be collected, eclipsing the $1.6
million Chrysler Corp. paid for violations at a plant in Newark,
Del.
   The original OSHA citation charged that Pittsburgh-based USX
permitted some of violations at the Pennsylvania plants, even
though the company agreed two years ago to eliminate them at all
its facilities.
   In a statement, the company said it agreed to pay the huge fine,
in part, to avoid lengthy and costly legal battles over the
government's allegations.
   ``We continue to believe that both Clairton Works and Fairless
Works are safe plants. ... Throughout our organization, there is no
higher priority than the safety and health of our people,'' Thomas
W. Sterling, vice president for employee relations at USS, said in
a statement.
   Clairton Works, near Pittsburgh, and Fairless Works, near
Philadelphia, were the two steel plants originally at issue in
OSHA's complaint.
   The United Steelworkers of America, the union representing about
18,000 USX workers, cautioned against the significance of the
settlement.
   ``The agreement confirms the union's contentions that USX
willfully allowed safety and health conditions in its facilities to
deteriorate to such a point that workers were in serious danger,''
a union statement said.
   Sterling said the company has already corrected several safety
conditions at the two plants and other improvements were now being
undertaken. He said that during settlement negotiations with the
government, there had been many areas of ``substantial disagreement
over the OSHA allegations.''
   The union said USX has refused to let the union review safety
records or have an input on safety improvements.
   ``This corporate attitude signals more battles over safety and
health at a time when other steel companies have joined with the
union in a variety of safety-related programs,'' said Andrew V.
``Lefty'' Palm, the union's chief negotiator in contract talks.
   OSHA's original citation, issued in November 1989, accused the
company of failing to provide safe walking and working surfaces;
substandard crane-safety standards; failure to properly guard
machines and power transmission equipment; noise violations;
failure to keep accurate records of injuries and illnesses;
structural flaws; and violations of electrical-safety standards.
   The citations stemmed from OSHA inspections that began earlier
in 1989 following complaints from both the union and employees.
OSHA said three workers had died at the two plants in the two years
leading up to the inspections; there had been 17 such deaths since
1972.
   Acting Labor Secretary Roderick A. DeArment said all of USX's
19,000 workers would benefit from Thursday's settlement because it
calls for the company to take corporate-wide action to strengthen
safety and health protection.
   Gerard Scannell, an assistant secretary of labor who heads OSHA,
said the corporate-wide safety programs will involve hearing
conservation, record keeping, crane safety and ``hazard
communications,'' which involves employee training.
   Those programs will be implement at the two plants involved in
the original complaint, along with USS facilities in Fairfield,
Ala.; Braddock, Pa.; Dravosburg, Pa.; and Chicago.
   USS has also promised to meet with the state of Indiana, which
operates its own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health
program, to seek a similar agreement covering its Gary, Ind.,
Works.

   Bob Hope will spend another Christmas
entertaining U.S. troops, this time amid looming war tensions in
the Middle East.
   ``He's going through piles of material and he's busy rehearsing
with Ann Jillian and Khrystyne Haje and Delores (Hope),'' Hope
spokesman Ward Grant said Thursday.
   The 87-year-old entertainer will be joined by the Pointer
Sisters, Marie Osmond, country singer Aaron Tippin, former
Cincinnati Reds baseball player Johnny Bench and former Chicago
Bears running back Walter Payton.
   The troupe will depart Los Angeles this weekend and plan to
return Dec. 29. Their exact itinerary was not disclosed.
   Hope first entertained troops for Christmas in 1948, during the
Berlin airlift. Since then he has spent the holiday with troops in
Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon (1983) and the Persian Gulf (1987).
   ``One of the loves of his life is the GI audience,'' Grant said.

   ROUND HILL, Nev. (AP) - Entertainer Wayne Newton's failure to
submit a plan for restoring an erosion-damaged stream on his
241-acre Lake Tahoe retreat will cost him $15,000.
   The renowned Las Vegas showman also must post a $150,000 bond
for missing a May deadline for submitting the improvement plans,
the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency said.
   The bistate agency decided Wednesday to extend the deadline for
submitting the land restoration plan until March 1, but also
required the fee and the bond. He'll get the bond back once the
work is done.
   Newton acquired the scenic property in 1985 for $2.5 million.

   TULSA, Okla. (AP) - ``Life Goes On'' actor Christopher Burke,
Iditarod dog sled racer Susan Butcher and Kansas City Chiefs
placekicker Nick Lowery were named to the U.S. Jaycees' Ten
Outstanding Young Americans for 1991.
   Burke, 25, of Point Lookout, N.Y., is an actor with Down's
syndrome who plays Corky Thatcher in the ABC series. He is the
spokesman for the National Down's Syndrome Congress.
   Butcher, 36, of Manley, Alaska, is a four-time winner of the
1,158-mile Iditarod race traversing Alaska from Anchorage to Nome.
She and fellow racer Joe Redinton are the only people to reach
Mount McKinley, North America's highest point, by dog sled.
   Lowery, 34, holds the National Football League record for most
field goals beyond 50 yards (18), and entered the 1990 season with
the highest percentage of field goals made in a career. He is
active in charity efforts.
   The 53rd annual awards were given to 10 Americans, ages 21
through 39, based on their contributions to society, personal
accomplishment and public service.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Garrison Keillor said it's not right that
he's living outside Minnesota and that he made a mistake by fussing
in public about media coverage of his personal life.
   The writer and radio show host left Minnesota in 1987 after
quitting his former long-running radio show, ``A Prairie Home
Companion.'' He moved to New York City, where he is host of a new
radio show, ``Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company.''
   ``I can go live in New York, the same way that a person can go
into the Army, but it's not my choice,'' Keillor told Mpls. St.
Paul magazine in its January 1991 issue. ``This is where everybody
I care about lives. It's where people talk like me and feel the
same way that I do.
   ``Every time I come back, I feel this twinge that my life took a
wrong turn,'' the best-selling author of ``Lake Wobegon Days''
said. ``This is not tragic. I'm a very lucky person. But Minnesota
is my home and I don't live here, and this is not right.''
   Keillor said he left Minnesota because local media ran stories
which he considered malicious. He wrote letters to the editor and
spoke out on television against the stories.
   Keillor told the magazine that his public feud with the media
``made matters worse, I'm sure.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Buddy Rogers, star of the 1927 film
``Wings,'' helped rededicate a refurbished 1929 hangar that is the
last original structure at Los Angeles International Airport.
   The hangar dedicated Thursday is listed by the city as a
historic cultural monument. It sheltered aircraft owned by such
stars as Jimmy Stewart and Rogers in the 1930s.
   Rogers, 86, was on hand ``to lend historic perspective to the
day,'' said Tom Winfrey, spokesman for the city's airport
department.
   The actor starred in movies from the 1920s through the 1940s,
including ``Wings,'' a silent film that won the first Academy Award
for best picture.
   Roger recalled that his wife of 40 years, actress Mary Pickford,
dedicated the original hangar.

<TEXT>
   A federal finance agency is holding up the
reappointment of its regional board members pending an examination
of conflict-of-interest charges leveled by a member of Congress.
   Steve Britt, executive director of the Federal Housing Finance
Board, said Thursday that the agency is requiring additional
financial disclosure documents from members of the 12 regional Home
Loan Banks, which help finance the savings and loan industry.
   In the meantime, a hold has been put on routine reappointments
to the regional boards, he said.
   The agency's action was disclosed on the same day that Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., complained about what he said were
conflicts of interest of a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Topeka.
   Richard H. Hughes did not fully repay loans from thrifts under
his purview, Schumer said. A Dallas business executive, Hughes
served on the board of the Topeka bank from 1979 until he was
replaced Dec. 13 because he had moved from the bank's district.
   During his tenure, he received ``multiple loans totaling $6
million from five different thrift institutions within the Topeka
region,'' Schumer said in a letter to Daniel F. Evans, chairman of
the federal agency overseeing the Topeka bank and 11 other similar
institutions.
   ``Mr. Hughes' case is a perfect example of what happens when the
fox is assigned to guard the chicken coop'' and ``epitomizes the
inherent potential for conflict of interest that fueled the ongoing
thrift crisis,'' Schumer said in a statement.
   Schumer, chairman of the House Budget task force on urgent
fiscal issues and a member of the House Banking Committee, released
a statement on Hughes along with the letter to Evans and a report
by his staff on the alleged conflicts.
   Hughes didn't immediately return telephone messages left at his
Dallas-based business, Hinderliter Corp. His home telephone number
is unlisted.
   The 12 regional home loan banks raise money by issuing
quasi-government bonds and uses it to provide low-cost loans to
S&amp;Ls. The Topeka bank covers institutions in Colorado, Kansas,
Nebraska and Oklahoma.
   Until August 1989, government regulators responsible for
examining and supervising S&amp;Ls worked for the regional banks. With
the passage of the S&amp;L bailout law, those regulators were
reassigned to the Office of Thrift Supervision, an arm of the
Treasury Department.
   Britt said the finance board was still examining whether to take
action against Hughes or whether the matter was under the
jurisdiction of the thrift office.
   Schumer wrote to Evans that the congressional staff report on
Hughes ``is simply shocking.''
   He said he will push for the adoption of stringent
conflict-of-interest regulations, not just for all directors and
officials of the Federal Home Loan Banks, but for officials and
directors of banks and S&amp;Ls as well.
   The staff report said ``throughout 1987 and 1988, Mr. Hughes had
delinquent loans outstanding at five thrift institutions in the
Topeka district which totaled in excess of $6 million.''
   ``The current status of these loans is not available ... but an
estimated loss to the FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp.) in the amount of $2.8 million existed with respect to three
loans'' at Mid-America Savings and Loan Association in Tulsa,
Okla., the report said.
   It also cited what it called potential conflicts of interest
involving Hughes' attempts to acquire two S&amp;Ls while serving on the
regional board. They are Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Claremore, Okla., and Valley Federal Savings and
Loan Association of Hutchinson, Kan.
   And, the report said, in August 1986 Hughes obtained employment
for a business associate, Thomas Sherman, as Tulsa branch manager
at American Federal Savings and Loan Association of Andarko, Okla.
   Sherman quit after board members of the S&amp;L, then under
government management, found him doing unrelated work for Hughes.
   Schumer also criticized Hughes for moving last year to Dallas,
which is outside the Topeka district, without informing the Topeka
board.

   They'll still need their parents' permission for
field trips, but teen-agers in the nation's largest school system
could get condoms next year simply by asking.
   Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez believes it's a matter of
life - or death from AIDS. New York City is home to about 3 percent
of the nation's 13- to 21-year-olds, but it has 20 percent of all
AIDS cases in that age group.
   ``We are sitting on a time bomb,'' Fernandez said.
   If the Board of Education approves Fernandez's proposal next
month, condoms would be available on request as early as next
spring at 120 schools that enroll 261,000 students.
   It would be the nation's most liberal public school AIDS policy,
said Robin Lewis, spokeswoman for the Center for Population
Options, a teen education and advocacy group based in Washington.
   A public hearing will be held Jan. 16. Since October, outspoken
opponents and supporters lined up at board meetings to establish
battle lines.
   ``Chancellor Fernandez is showing an enormous amount of courage
and leadership in tackling this issue,'' said Trish Moylan
Torruella, education director of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America. ``There are alarmingly high rates of HIV among
adolescents in New York City, particularly among African Americans
and Hispanics.''
   Opponents, like Monsignor John Woolsey, a Roman Catholic leader
of the 75-member Coalition of Concerned Clergy, say doling out
condoms at schools would endorse promiscuity.
   Eleanor Kelly, a mother of three teen-agers and past president
of the conservative group Parent Roundtable, agrees: ``A
contraceptive approach ... sends the wrong message and promotes a
false sense of security, thereby encouraging more of our young
people to engage in high-risk behavior.''
   Fernandez said he's sensitive to the moral dilemma, but the
issue goes beyond sex.
   ``I don't disregard, offhand, their point of view as it being a
moral issue,'' said Fernandez. ``I'm saying that from my
perspective, with my chancellor's hat on, I'm looking at some very
horrendous and frightening data that deals with kids living or not
living.''
   The plan calls for trained volunteers to give away condoms at
each public high school. Counseling or parental permission would
not be required. Fernandez says that would scare kids away.
   Fernandez said new AIDS and sex education programs will continue
to stress that abstinence is the only guaranteed method of avoiding
the sexual transmission of AIDS.
   But he says adults must be realistic. The city Health Department
estimates 80 percent of the New York's young people have had sex by
age 19.
   ``I wish I could stand up in front of my students and tell them
`abstain' and have the assurances that by teaching that, that would
happen,'' he said. ``But it's not happening.''
   The city Health Department says that as of September, 28 percent
of the AIDS patients in the city, or about 4,200 people, were ages
20 to 29. Many contracted it as teen-agers.
   A Gallup poll for New York Newsday showed 60 percent of New York
adults approved of the condom plan. Among parents of children in
public schools, 54 percent approved and 39 percent disapproved.
   Elsewhere, students can get condoms at high school health
clinics in Chicago, Baltimore and at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin
School clinic in Massachusetts.
   In Mill Valley, Calif., a lawsuit from opponents stalled efforts
to distribute condoms. In October, a school board in Easton, Md.,
rejected a plan for nurses to distribute condoms at two high
schools.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta says 56 percent
of high school students nationwide have had sex and about 20
percent had four or more partners. It estimates that 1 in every 200
people ages 15 to 24 has the AIDS virus.
   Other sexually transmitted diseases are rampant in that age
group, and 1 million pregnancies a year ``result from the very same
behavior,'' said Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, head of the AIDS school health
education branch of the CDC.
   ``Each community needs to address its unique nature and concerns
and make decisions based on epidemiology as well as ... values,''
said Kolbe. ``On both sides of the argument, people really are
looking to do the best thing.''

<TEXT>
   On a C-130 Hercules transport
plane headed north across the Arctic Circle, Air Force Sgt. Carl
Warrings donned his Santa suit and started practicing his ``Ho, ho,
ho.''
   A half-hour later, he and 1,500 pounds of Christmas presents -
including a community washing machine - were lowered onto the
frozen tundra outside this Gwich'in Indian village.
   A few dozen small children, bundled in furs and snowsuits,
waited with their parents. It was 45 degrees below zero - warmer
than it's been here all month.
   ``This is good. Usually when Santa comes it's really cold,''
said Kias Peter, the village's traditional chief.
   The kids flocked around Santa when he appeared out of the belly
of the green plane. Ol' Saint Nick then stepped on the back of a
dog sled and was pulled the mile or so into town by snowmobile.
   It was the 24th straight year the Air Force brought gifts,
goodwill and Santa Claus from Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage
to the 125 residents of Arctic Village. The village is 500 miles
north of Anchorage and more than 100 miles north of the Arctic
Circle.
   In return, the village threw its annual potlatch feast to
welcome the plane. Caribou stew, salted caribou dumplings,
whitefish and other local delicacies were spread out on a table
inside the village school.
   ``We fixed up chairs and tables and put up decorations,'' said
9-year-old Annie James. ``I'm so happy that Santa came.''
   ``The whole village participates - men, women, children,
everyone,'' said Margaret Tritt, the school cook who supervised the
dinner for more than 100 people on Dec. 10.
   The children sang songs in Gwich'in and English and gave the
visitors gifts, from ceremonial leather boots to drawings. The Air
Force put on a magic show, and then Santa handed out 54
individually marked presents for the children.
   He also brought the washing machine and fixings for a Christmas
feast.
   Annie got a toy piano keyboard and sang ``Silent Night'' with
it. Her friend Crystal Frank, 8, got two cassettes by New Kids on
the Block, her favorite singing group.
   Five-year-old Rocky John got a jacket. Everybody got candy.
   Parents had sent their children's Christmas wish lists to
Elmendorf, where the 17th Tactical Airlift Squadron organizes the
annual visit with help from the Officer's Wives Club.
   This year Santa's gifts to Arctic Village cost about $2,000,
most of it raised at a chili cook-off last fall, said 1st Lt.
Robert Allen, the C-130's pilot.
   The Air Force's Santa trip to Arctic Village began in 1967, when
the caribou herds the village depends on migrated too far away.
Village leaders wrote Alaska's congressional delegation for help
and the Air Force airlifted local hunters closer to their prey,
Peter said.
   The December flight quickly became a holiday ritual in the
Episcopalian village.
   This year was the first that Santa's dog sled was pulled into
the village by snowmobile instead of dogs, said Edward Sam, whose
dogs have done the honors in years past. This year, he said, he
didn't exercise them in time.
   The Gwich'in are an Athabaskan Indian group, the northernmost
known Indians, Sam said.
   ``We're a little isolated from the modern life. But we get TV
that tells us everything - news about the troubled world. And
visits like this are nice,'' Sam said.

<HEAD>Government Mounting Effort to Eliminate Lead Poisoning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government, in one of the largest
efforts of its kind, is developing a three-pronged effort to wipe
out lead poisoning among children.
   The initiative will involve removing lead-based paint from
millions of homes, with a focus on lower-income families.
Monitoring lead hazards in homes where children have high levels of
lead in their blood and offering nutritional guidance as well as
treatment are proposed. And tighter drinking water standards and a
ban on lead plumbing fixtures may be adopted.
   ``This is saying we can eliminate this disease. We don't need
children being poisoned by lead in the United States,'' said Dr.
Sue Binder, chief of the lead poisoning prevention branch in the
Centers for Disease Control.
   The initiative will require close cooperation among all levels
of government and the private sector.
   ``It will require society-wide effort,'' Binder said in an
interview Thursday.
   The plans may be the largest effort designed to eliminate an
environmental disease, she said. But so far, the CDC's
recommendations represent only a strategic plan. ``We still need to
think through the things we need to do and the details of how to do
them,'' she said.
   CDC's plans are being circulated among top officials at the
Department of Health and Human Services. The Environmental
Protection Agency also has not announced its plans, but the
Department of Housing and Urban Development laid out its plans last
week.
   Lead poisoning can damage the nervous system and lead to mental
retardation and other mental disorders. It also can damage the
liver, lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and cause
convulsions. The effects cannot be reversed.
   Children are most susceptible because their nervous systems are
still developing and are sensitive to lead, Binder said. Their
bodes also absorb more lead than adults do, and they are exposed
to higher levels of lead because they so often put things,
including dirty hands, in their mouths, she said.
   The HUD plan focuses on removing lead-based paint from homes or
covering it over so it is no longer a health threat. The plan
includes a financial assistance program and is designed to help
lower-income families with children.
   A HUD study found that young children are living in about 3.8
million U.S. homes that have peeling lead-based paint or lead in
household dust.
   Financial details of the plan will be disclosed as part of the
federal budget for next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 1991.
   The Health and Human Services' plan is expected to be out in a
few months, Binder said.
   Not all of the details of the plan have been worked out, she
said, but it is based on an advisory committee's recommendation for
more aggressive monitoring, testing and treatment.
   Current guidelines say steps - ranging from nutritional
education to medical treatment - should be taken when lead in the
blood reaches 25 micrograms per deciliter.
   The advisory committee said intervention should begin when
levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter are reached. Different levels
of monitoring and testing were recommended for levels up to 25
micrograms, at which point medical treatment should be considered,
according to the committee's guidance.
   ``The committee is saying that environmental intervention,
nutritional information and education (about lead poisoning) need
to start at lower levels'' of lead in the blood, Binder said.
   An estimated 250,000 children had lead levels above 25
micrograms in 1984, she said.
   The EPA is considering tightening federal standards for lead in
drinking water and prohibiting the use of lead in plumbing fixtures
like brass faucets. Agency sources said a decision would be made
early next year.
   The EPA also is considering banning the disposal of lead
batteries in conventional garbage dumps.

<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who went on a shooting
rampage at a military base said he wanted to kill President Bush
and send planes to Saudi Arabia because he disagreed with Bush's
actions against Iraq, the FBI said.
   Robert Craig Anderson, 41, was arrested Wednesday night outside
Moffett Naval Air Station. He had driven his car through the base's
front gate, taken an air traffic controller hostage and fired more
than a dozen shots from a rifle before being caught as he tried to
flee, the FBI said.
   Interviewed later in a hospital by FBI agent John Zent, Anderson
said he planned to kill the controller and other Moffett personnel,
take over the base ``and dispatch planes to Saudi Arabia as he
disagreed with President Bush's present actions concerning Iraq,''
Zent said in an affidavit.
   Anderson also told Zent ``his intention (was) to kill President
Bush,'' the affidavit said.
   Anderson, a bricklayer from Mountain View, is being held for
psychiatric evaluation and waived his right to an attorney, the FBI
said.
   The affidavit did not specify Anderson's disagreements with
Bush's actions. It was presented to U.S. Magistrate Patricia
Trumbull who ordered Anderson held without bail.
   Anderson faces seven charges, including assault with intent to
commit murder, kidnapping, making a threat against the president,
destruction of government property and carrying an illegal firearm.
The felony assault and kidnap charges carry a maximum life
sentence.

<DATELINE>KIBBUTZ MIZRAA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mizraa looks like the ultimate
kibbutz success story, until you read the small print on the
sausages, liverwurst and frankfurters.
   ``Not of kosher type,'' say the wrappers on many of the products
that come out of Mizraa's meat-processing plant. It's the
kibbutzniks' way of telling customers that the food contains pork.
   Now a law is before Parliament that would outlaw the marketing
of pork to the Jewish public. The result is an escalation of the
long, rancorous war between the secular public and the Orthodox
Jewish parties which can make and break Israeli governments.
   Orthodox Jews revile pork as the most flagrantly non-kosher item
on the list of edibles banned by biblical edict.
   Nonetheless, it is widely available from butchers and
restaurants which cater to the secular public. But it's a dish that
dares not speak its name, appearing instead under such euphemisms
as ``special meat'' or ``white meat.''
   So why wait until now to take action? ``We weren't conscious
until now of how much it was spreading,'' says Rabbi Menachem
Porush, whose Agudat Israel party is sponsoring the anti-pork law.
``The truth is, I don't even know what the thing looks like.''
   The ultra-modern meat plant at Mizraa in the Jezreel Valley in
southern Galilee earns $15 million a year - 70 percent of the
kibbutz's income.
   Mizraa doesn't breed pigs, but it is Israel's largest source of
non-kosher meat, accounting for one-fifth of the industry and
exporting its delicacies all over the world.
   It provides a living for thousands of people at the factory in
the Jezreel Valley, the pig farms owned by both Jews and Christians
and Mizraa's nationwide chain of more than 300 delis.
   Moshe Lapidot, Mizraa's chief accountant, says that beyond the
money, a principle is at stake.
   ``We, as secular, free people living in a democratic country,
can't accept a small ultra-Orthodox minority trying to dictate ...
fanatical religious laws whose time has passed,'' he said over
coffee in Mizraa's vast, abundantly stocked deli.
   The pig law is part of the religious legislation which Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir promised as the price of adding Agudat
Israel's four parliamentary seats to his coalition.
   But it has become a test case of how far the rabbis can enforce
religious law.
   Already, compromises are in the air. Agudat Israel is now
prepared to allow pork to be marketed in municipal districts with a
Christian population of more than 500 or 1,000.
   At first, the religious camp refused to consider compensating
those who stand to lose income. Rabbi Avraham Ravitz of the
ultra-Orthodox Torah Flag party likens it to compensating pimps for
income they would lose if prostitution were outlawed.
   But this week the parliamentary committee was stopped in its
tracks by a message from Agriculture Minister Raphael Eitan, who
insisted on discussing compensation.
   Shamir faces a tough choice. The compensation bill could top
$500 million, a fortune Israel cannot afford. But if the law is
stalled, he could lose Agudat Israel's vital support.
   The kibbutzniks are fighting back with demonstrations and bumper
stickers.
   Three Mizraa men were arrested recently on suspicion of burning
tires in the Orthodox town of Bnei Brak - a protest tactic copied
from Palestinian activists in the occupied territories.
   Such incidents illustrate a widening rift between the
kibbutzniks, who regard themselves as the vanguard of secular
Zionism, and the Orthodox, who regard themselves as defenders of
the Jewish heritage.
   Last March a prominent Orthodox sage, Rabbi Eliezer Schach,
outraged the secular public by declaring: ``There are kibbutzim
that don't know what Yom Kippur is or the Sabbath ... and they
raise rabbits and pigs. Do they have any links with their
forefathers?''
   Yom Kippur is the Jewish day of atonement.
   Mizraa kibbutznik Hadas Sandorowicz says her own forefathers,
who helped build Mizraa on Jezreel's swamps, would be horrified to
find the law being dictated by ``four non-Zionist fanatics who
didn't raise a finger to build this country.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army neurosurgeon is pleading for
permission to resume laboratory tests that involve shooting cats in
the head, but animal rights activists say the research is useless
and cruel.
   The activists are delaying important work that could reduce U.S.
combat deaths in the event of war, Dr. Michael Carey said Thursday.
   He conducted the cat-shooting research starting in 1983, but a
congressional suspension prompted by activists was imposed 13
months ago.
   ``An anesthetized cat that will feel no pain appears more
important to a small number of Americans than does a soldier
risking his life for his country,'' said Carey, a reservist now on
active duty and heading for the Middle East in two weeks.
   During the Vietnam war, Carey was with an Army medical unit that
performed surgery on 100 soldiers with brain wounds. Death rates of
U.S. troops suffering from head wounds were the same in Vietnam as
they were in World War II, medical experts say.
   Tourists see names of the dead when they look at the wall of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, but ``when I look ... I
still hear a voice saying, `Help me, Doc,''' Carey said at a news
conference.
   He said his research can help. Critics say it can't.
   ``How many years is it going to take for him to understand that
he hasn't been helping us?'' said Dr. Neal Bernard, president of
the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
   Carey's research is ``useless and cruel,'' Barnard said in an
interview.
   Carey ``is using an old research ploy, saying ``I'm the only
person with the answer,''' said Barnard. ``His work has been a
tremendous waste of money.''
   More than 16,000 Americans die annually from gunshot wounds to
the brain and 70,000 others suffer serious head injuries from other
causes.
   Using a $2 million Army grant, Carey worked in a lab at
Louisiana State University, firing pellets into the heads of 700
anesthetized cats. The goal was to improve treatment for head
injuries. Carey was investigating the use of a promising drug when
his research was stopped, supporters say.
   The congressional ban was put in place pending a review of
Carey's work by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress. A newly released GAO report found the research
worthwhile but expressed concern about the management of anesthesia
and postoperative care.
   The GAO concluded the Army should decide whether continuing the
research will ``produce additional useful information.''
   The Army plans to make that decision soon, said Chuck Deasy, a
spokesman for the service's medical research and development
command at Fort Detrick, Md.

<TEXT>
   The president of Quincy College says he'll
use a 201-year-old state morals law to try to keep students from
buying condoms on his campus.
   ``There's a legal question in my mind as to whether condoms are
permitted on campus or not, given the responsibility of teachers
and administrators to teach chastity,'' President O. Clayton
Johnson said.
   A local schools committee of nurses, teachers and parents has
recommended that condoms be distributed on the junior college
campus, part of the Quincy school system.
   Johnson, who says he is morally opposed to providing condoms on
campus, added that a law adopted in 1789 also may make distribution
illegal. The law orders college presidents to teach such virtues as
``universal benevolence, sobriety, industry and frugality.''
   ``I would reject selling them at the college, and then I would
ask for a legal opinion whether I have the right to do so,'' he
said Tuesday.
   Peter Chisholm, a spokesman for the state Regents of Higher
Education, said the law is out of date.
   Philip Johnston, the state human services secretary, has
recommended that Massachussets high schools distribute condoms to
students to fight the spread of AIDS.
   ``This is a life and death issue and it's something that must be
taken seriously by educators and health care professionals,'' he
said.

   A jury acquitted a jeweler of charges he
went too far in fatally shooting two robbers who had fled his
store.
   After two days of deliberations, jurors late Thursday found
Varhag Babayan, 28, innocent of one count of second-degree murder,
two counts of voluntary manslaughter and one count of reckless
endangerment in the June 16 deaths of Donald Shelton, 33, and Steve
Powell, 37, both of Washington.
   Prosecutors had asked jurors to consider convicting Babayan of
voluntary manslaughter in the death of Powell, an amputee who used
crutches, if they rejected the second-degree murder charge.
   Babayan could have been sentenced to up to 45 years in prison if
convicted on all counts.
   Both men were shot several times, each at least once in the
back, outside Prestige Jewelers in nearby Bethesda, Md., according
to testimony by Ann Dixon, a state medical examiner.
   During closing statements, prosecutor Robert Dean told jurors
Babayan used excessive force in firing his .38 caliber handgun.
   Defense attorney Edward Genn said although the killings were
regrettable, Babayan was defending himself and his livelihood.
   Babayan testified he believed his actions were justified. He
told jurors he reacted instinctively when he chased Shelton and
shot him and Powell in a car in the middle of a busy street after
the two took the contents of two showcases from his store.
   ``I knew I had to do something,'' he said. ``I was not going to
allow him to get away.''

<TEXT>
   The military is threatening to shoot down
airplanes suspected of carrying semi-processed coca leaf, the raw
material of cocaine.
   A communique Thursday from the military joint command said
airplanes that refuse to land for inspection or that change their
route without notice will be ``captured and-or destroyed.''
   The communique said the measure went into effect Tuesday in San
Martin department, where the main coca leaf-growing area in Peru -
the Upper Huallaga Valley - is located. Dozens of illegal airstrips
are scattered in the valley's dense jungle.
   The communique did not say how the airplanes would be tracked.
The military is not known to operate any radar stations in the
department.
   The threat represented what would be the air force's first move
toward taking part in anti-drug efforts. Peru is the world's main
source of coca leaf.
   The semi-processed coca leaf is flown mainly to Colombia, to the
north, where it is refined into pure cocaine.
   The U.S. Embassy in Lima said it had no comment on the
military's plan.
   Washington has been pressuring Peru's military to become more
involved in fighting drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga Valley.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Peruvian police
operate an anti-drug airbase in the valley, but the helicopters
that fly out of the base attack airstrips and drug laboratories.
   The United States offered to refurbish 20 Peruvian air force
planes to use against drug traffickers, as part of a 36
million-dollar military aid agreement, but in September President
Alberto Fujimori refused to sign the pact.
   He said at the time that more economic assistance must be tied
to the military aid to successfully combat drug trafficking.
   Army Gen. Mario Brito, head of the department's military forces,
told a Lima newspaper that three fighter planes are already
stationed in Tarapoto, a jungle city 380 miles north of Lima. He
said more airplanes would be moved to the area in the next few
weeks.

<HEAD>Blood Testing Finds Harmful HTLV Virus Infections Low in U.S.</HEAD>

   A relative of the AIDS virus that can cause
leukemia remains rare in the United States, federal officials say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
just 902 of 6.4 million American Red Cross blood donations in 1989
- 0.014 percent - tested positive for HTLV-I virus.
   The Council of Community Blood Centers, another blood-donation
organization, reported a similar rate - 0.018 percent - among its
2.8 million donations from December 1988 through the end of 1989,
the CDC said in its weekly research report.
   The Food and Drug Administration recommended in November 1988
that blood centers test all donated blood for HTLV-I, which causes
a vicious form of adult leukemia.
   HTLV viruses are retroviruses in the same family as HIV. Like
HIV, HTLV can be passed through contaminated drug needles or sexual
contact.
   Tests for HTLV-I also turn positive in the presence of a closely
related virus, HTLV-II. The second virus hasn't been positively
linked to a specific disease, but since doctors usually can't be
sure which HTLV virus a person has, blood donors and others testing
positive should be counseled as if they had the leukemia virus, the
CDC said.
   Researchers believe HTLV-I and II are equally common, the CDC
noted.
   HTLV-I is common is southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of
sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America.
   American Red Cross data indicate that HTLV infections in this
country are most common among women, blacks, Hispanics and Asians.
Risk factors also include intravenous drug use, sexual contact with
an IV drug user, Japanese or Caribbean ancestry or sexual contact
with Japanese or Caribbean people, the CDC said.
   Twenty percent of male blood donors infected with HTLV had a
history of IV drug use, while 23 percent were born in - or had
sexual contact with - someone from the Caribbean.
   Among female blood donors who were infected, 29 percent had
sexual contact with an IV drug user and 17 percent were from the
Caribbean or having sex with someone from there.

<HEAD>Judge Won't Delay Implementation Of Ethics Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to delay
implementation of a new ethics law that prohibits government
workers from being paid for writing articles or making speeches.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rejected the request
for a temporary restraining order, saying none of the employees had
shown they would be ``irreparably harmed'' if they had to wait for
the matter to be heard in court.
   Two public employees unions and the American Civil Liberties
Union, representing 10 government workers, filed suits to prevent
enforcement of the ban on honoraria, which takes effect Jan. 1.
   Jackson's refusal to delay implementation of the provision set
the stage for the employees to file emergency appeals.
   Attorneys for the workers, who earn outside income by lecturing,
writing freelance articles or performing religious ceremonies as
ordaied clergy, argued that the law unconstitutionally restricts
freedom of speech.
   Justice Department attorney Jeffrey S. Gutman argued that the
statute does not violate the First Amendment because ``it's only
payment for speech that is prohibited by the statute, not the
speech itself.''
   Gutman told Jackson that the law may even apply to federal
employees who are paid $50 a month to sing in their church choir.
He said, however, that the workers are free to continue their
outside activities if the receive no compensation.
   He noted that a 1974 law that has never been challenged in the
courts prohibits federal employees from earning more than $2,000 a
year for articles, speeches and appearances.
   ``I find it startling this issue has not been litigated at
all,'' said Jackson, who did not rule on the merits of the issue.
   Lawyers for the National Treasury Employees Union immediately
filed a motion for a temporary emergency stay with the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   Attorneys for the American Federation of Government Employees
and the ACLU, which filed the companion cases, said they would do
the same as soon as possible.
   The law was enacted in November 1989 as part of legislation that
prohibited members of the House from receiving honoraria for
speeches, appearances and articles.
   The ban does not apply to the Senate but the Office of
Government Ethics says it is enforceable on virtually all federal
employees, with a possible civil fine of up to $10,000.

<HEAD>Survey: Hospital Staff Shortages Getting Worse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shortage of X-ray technicians, physical
therapists and 12 other types of hospital workers worsened last
year, prompting many institutions to offer higher salaries,
according to a new survey.
   ``Hospitals have a growing concern about their ability to
maintain adequate services in light of these persistent
shortages,'' Barbara Bloom Kreml, human resources director of the
Chicago-based American Hospital Association, said Thursday.
   Many hospitals reported they are boosting salaries to attract
and keep workers. Some reported they are cutting patient services,
Kreml said.
   ``One of the areas most affected is rehabilitation services
because of shortages of physical therapists, occupational
therapists and speech pathologists,'' she said in a statement.
``Increasing compensation costs (salaries) make it difficult for
hospitals to keep costs in line.''
   The association's survey of 3,706 hospitals found that vacancies
were highest for physical therapists, with 16.4 percent of
full-time positions unfilled in 1989, up from 15.8 percent the year
before.
   Thirteen other occupations faced growing shortages in 1989,
including certified nurse anesthetists, a field in which 10.8
percent of jobs went unfilled last year, compared with 10.2 percent
the previous year, the AHA said.
   ``We're facing an incredible shortage,'' said Betty Colitti,
spokeswoman for the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists,
based in suburban Park Ridge.
   She said job advertisements in the group's newsletter have
quadrupled over the past four years to 16 magazine-size pages from
four and that the average annual salary is $58,000, with nurse
anesthetists in some areas of the country making starting salaries
of $98,000.
   Getting certification for the specialty takes a registered nurse
two extra years of school and training, Colitti said, adding that
more schools and programs are needed to alleviate the shortage. She
said 65 percent of the anesthesia in the United States is
administered by nurse anesthetists.
   Other occupations in which shortages worsened from 1988 to 1989,
according to the survey:
   - Clinical perfusionists, 11.5 percent of jobs unfilled in 1989,
up from 10 percent the previous year. Perfusionists direct and
supervise the operation of heart and lung machines, physiologic
monitoring instruments and related equipment used in cardiac
surgical procedures.
   - Speech pathologists, 9.9 percent of jobs unfilled, up from 9
percent.
   - Nuclear medicine technologists, 8.9 percent, up from 7.7
percent.
   - Respiratory therapists, 8.9 percent, up from 8.8 percent.
   - X-ray technicians, 7.6 percent, up from 7.2 percent.
   - Pharmacists, 7.1 percent, up from 6.5 percent.
   - Pharmacist technicians, 4.1 percent, up from 4 percent.
   - Licensed practical nurses, 6.5 percent, up from 6.3 percent.
   - Social workers, 7 percent, up from 5.9 percent.
   - Lab technicians, 6.4 percent, up from 5.2 percent.
   - Medical technologists, 6 percent, up from 5.8 percent. They
perform chemical, microscopic and bacteriologic lab tests and
procedures to gather data for use in diagnosis and treatment of
disease.
   - Medical records coders, 6.6 percent, up from 5.9 percent. They
put codes in medical records to classify them under Medicare's
pricing system.
   Shortages lessened in only four personnel categories -
occupational therapists, ultrasound technologists, nursing aides
and medical transcriptionists.

<TEXT>
   No matter what the outcome of the
Persian Gulf crisis, a long-term foreign military presence will be
needed to ensure stability in the region, Saudi and foreign
military experts say.
   There are varying views about the shape of the foreign presence
and how long it will have to stay, but the experts agree it will
take years until the Saudi military and armies of other gulf states
are able to protect their territory.
   Much depends on the time Saudi Arabia will need to overcome its
manpower shortages and build an army large enough to eliminate the
need for foreign protection.
   Regional security is expected to be the major issue tackled by
the Gulf Cooperation Council summit that opens in Qatar Saturday.
   ``It has to be a robust GCC. We're going to have to cooperate on
security, definitely,'' Secretary-General Abdullah Bishara of
Kuwait said in a recent interview.
   The envisioned security arrangements will undoubtedly involve
the United States in some form or other, given the need to
guarantee oil supplies.
   U.S. Secretary of States James A. Baker III has talked of the
need for a new security structure in the region once the Kuwait
crisis has been settled.
   No one has disclosed any details yet. But the general outline
appears to be for a large force, preferably Americans working under
a United Nations flag, stationed around Kuwait's border.
   The smaller emirates will likely provide shore facilities for a
large armada, much as they did during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   Saudi Arabia plans to more than double the size of their armed
forces over the next few years and buy up to $20 billion worth of
U.S. weaponry.
   ``We'll build up our armed forces to the point of adequate and
absolute deterrent to any aggression,'' said Prince Fahd bin
Abdallah, the deputy defense minister.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia's quick
request for outside help, showed how unprepared the Saudis and
their neighbors were to defend themselves despite massive spending
on advanced weapon systems over the last decade.
   The invasion also woke the ulf states to the harsh reality that
they could no longer afford the squabbling and minimal security
cooperation that had characterized their relations in the past.
   The ruling Al-Saud family had avoided creating a large army,
fearing a competing center of power. The 67,000-man regular forces
and the 55,000-strong paramilitary National Guard were formed to
balance each other.
   Military experts say the Saudis will need external military
support for four to 20 years until they can properly defend their
territory. Iraq boasts a military force of 1 million.
   Although Saudi Arabia has promised domestic Islamic
conservatives that U.S. troops will leave as soon as the gulf
crisis is over, future security arrangements in the gulf will
undoubtedly involve the United States.
   Thousands of American military personnel are expected to remain
in the region on ``training missions'' to help the Saudis absorb
the new weapons, including about 700 M1-A1 tanks and dozens of F-15
fighter planes.
   More than 250,000 U.S. troops are now based in Saudi Arabia as
part of the multinational force sent to the kingdom to deter Iraq.
   The gulf states also face a major dilemma in deciding how to
curb the regional ambitions of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if he
agrees to withdraw from Kuwait.
   If Saddam pulls out with his military intact, Iraq will remain a
major threat to Saudi Arabia and the vulnerable gulf monarchies.
   And unless Saddam's drive for nuclear weapons is checked and his
growing arsenal of weapons eliminated, his threat will only
increase.
   Yet if his army is destroyed, the resulting vacuum could lead to
a scramble for power among other regional leaders and leave
militarily weak gulf states vulnerable.
   ``The region can never find the same tranquility as before.
There's been so much rancor, so much movement of people,'' said a
Western military official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Saudis also see other potential threats.
   To the south, last May's merger of North and South Yemen has
created a new regional force. The new Yemen republic's 10 million
people outnumber Saudi Arabia's 8 million indigenous people.
   Yemen's backing for Saddam prompted the kingdom to expel
hundreds of thousands of Yemenis who had been working in Saudi
Arabia.
   Traditional enmity has long prevented them from marking their
common border and the Saudis plan to build new military bases
there.
   To the north, Jordan has expressed sympathy for Saddam despite
its adherence to U.N. sanctions imposed after the invasion of
Kuwait.
   While Saudi Arabia's support for the Palestinian cause has
always been more financial than military, the Arab-Israeli conflict
is also a major source of regional instability.
   ``They see themselves surrounded by enemies,'' said a Western
diplomat.

   A state agency wants to end the saga of the
Shoreham nuclear power plant by tearing down the idle reactor
rather than mothballing or entombing it.
   The Long Island Power Authority has asked its board of trustees
to approve a plan to dismantle and decontaminate the reactor at a
cost of $186 million. The authority hopes to ship the reactor's
radioactive parts out of state to a certified nuclear waste dump.
   The authority rejected two more costly options: mothballing, in
which the plant would be shut down for 20 or 30 years but could be
started up again; and entombment, burying the plant inside a wall.
   The authority's trustees were to vote on the plan today. If
approved it will be submitted to the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission before the end of the year, authority chairman Richard
Kessel said at a news conference Thursday.
   The $5.5 billion Shoreham plant, on the north shore of Long
Island about 60 miles east of New York City, was completed in 1984
after 11 years of construction. It received a full operating
license from the NRC but only was tested at 5 percent of capacity
and never generated electricity.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo and Suffolk County officials opposed the plant,
arguing that Long Island could not be safely evacuated if a nuclear
accident occurred.
   In 1987, Shoreham owner Long Island Lighting Co. agreed to sell
the plant to the state for $1 in return for annual rate increases
for 10 years. The power authority is overseeing the shutdown.
   Kessel, also executive director of the state Consumer Protection
Board, said that if the NRC accepts the decommissioning plan within
the next nine months, the power authority could start dismantling
the reactor in October and finish in late 1993.
   The NRC has not yet ruled on an application filed last June to
transfer Shoreham's operating license from Long Island Lighting to
the power authority. The commission is waiting for the authority to
decide which decommissioning plan to pursue.

   The price of The New York Times' national

14.
   The Times had been charging 50 cents for daily copies of its
national edition in the Midwest and 60 cents in the Southwest,
spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said Thursday.
   The higher price reflects the newspaper's higher production and
distribution costs, she said.
   The price for the national edition in the Southeast was raised

Coast. The daily paper costs 50 cents in the Northeast, except in
the tri-state area near New York where it is 40 cents.

<DATELINE>ROVANIEMI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old man with the white beard and
the red suit meets 400,000 people a year, and most of them sit on
his knee.
   This global gift-giver never seems to tire however, even when
grown-ups bounce on his lap and ask for presents. He says hello and
goodbye in any of 20 languages.
   ``The Japanese never ask for a present, only for peace and good
health,'' Santa said. ``Although one Japanese woman did ask for a
boyfriend. She was 27.''
   Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, is on duty in Rovaniemi every
day, even through the summer when giant mosquitoes can make life
miserable north of the Arctic Circle.
   Finns call him Joulupukki, the Christmas goat, recalling
pre-Christian days when celebrants of year-end festivities wore
goat horns.
   Some shrewd private marketing and generous government help have
turned this small-town capital of Finnish Lapland into a center for
the rapidly growing Santa Claus industry in the northern
hemisphere.
   In Canada, the post office answers more than 700,000 letters to
Santa Claus, including some in Braille. Letters indicating
desperate need are referred to welfare agencies.
   Magnus Hamsund, Norway's principle Santa, makes goodwill trips
to the United States and Australia.
   Greenland's government is setting up a permanent Santa's
workshop in Nuuk, the capital, and selling $20 Christmas packages.
Profits will benefit a 388,000-square-mile wilderness park, as big
as France and Germany combined.
   About 2,500 handicapped British children were being flown this
year to a Santa village in Mora, Sweden.
   Less than 1 percent of Japanese are Christian and Christmas is
not a holiday, but Hirocho, a small town on Hokkaidoisland, has
sponsored Santa festivities for the past six years. Town spokesman
Kazuhiro Doshita said Masahiko Tsugawa, an actor and toy
distributor, has bought a Scottish castle to be rebuilt in Hirocho
as Santa's dreamland.
   In 1927, a Finnish radio announcer broadcast the discovery of
Santa's home on the remote Korvatunturi hill. The fantasy charmed
the Finns, balancing precariously between the Soviet Union and the
West and depending largely on logging to make their way in the
world.
   Today, Santa Claus is Lapland's third most important tourist
attraction after midsummer events, when the sun never sets over the
arctic, and late winter skiing, when it barely rises.
   Thirty-five charter flights are bringing British visitors to
Rovaniemi this Christmas season, including 12 one-day round trips
on the supersonic Concorde. The Concorde flights cost $3,200 per
person.
   Santa's mail service is providing computerized replies in eight
languages to more than 500,000 letters with the Finnish post office
paying for the stamps.
   Daniel Nyburg of 50 Everett Avenue, Akron, Ohio, wrote,``I will
have cookies and milk for you and dog biscuits for your reindeer.''
   Gift shops at Santa's village near Rovaniemi earn more than $4.7
million a year.
   Entrepreneurs seek to blend the commercial, the cultural and the
cute. So far, they say, they have felt no effects of the Western
business recession.
   ``We have not yet managed to spoil the spirit of Santa Claus,''
said Taina Torvela of the Santa Claus Land Finland Association, an
umbrella marketing group.
   ``If we make this only business, it will not work.
   After all, people need to dream and they have forgotten how.
Santa Claus can teach us.''
   Lapps or Samis, as the region's aboriginal inhabitants prefer to
be called, number only 6,000 of Finnish Lapland's 300,000 people.
Some, traditional reindeer herders, have profited by supplying
their animals to pull tourist sleighs over frozen lakes.
   Visitors also drink reindeer milk and eat reindeer meat fried
over a log fire, helped by Finns wearing elf suits and conical
hats, all in red.
   ``Follow that elf,'' tourists are told, on their way to stand in
calf-deep snow under a pitch-black sky at 8 a.m. to watch
schoolchildren dressed in white perform a dance of the forest
spirits.
   London tile distributor Gregory Palmer brought his family to
Rovaniemi telling his two sons,``Father Christmas invited us.''
   ``We saw him at his home and I sat on his knee,'' said Charles,
5.
   After four days of Santa Claus activities, James, 2, commented,
``I want to go home.''

   The Kremlin's Palace of Congresses resembles a
grand opera house, and Eduard Shevardnadze's surprise resignation
as foreign minister was the latest drama of perestroika to play the
palace.
   The modernistic parliament building, built in the early 1960s,
for years echoed with the sonorous drone of endless, colorless
speeches and monotonous debate that characterized the Brezhnev era,
from 1964 to 1982.
   But in recent years some lively things have taken place at the
palace.
   A little over a year ago, Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, near
his death, urged the Communist Party to give up its absolute grip
on power; this year the party surrendered its leading role during a
party congress here.
   In July, Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic,
hushed the congress with the announcement he was quitting the
party.
   On Thursday, Shevardnadze took his bow, startling the Congress
of People's Deputies by resigning as foreign minister, warning in
an emotion-choked voice that ``dictatorship is coming.''
   Shevardnadze began his address theatrically: waving a prepared
text in the air and then discarding it for what he called ``the
briefest and most difficult speach of my life'' - a rambling
15-minute discourse that ended with him storming from the podium
stage left.
   As if it were intermission, the deputies then bounded out of
their plush red seats and flooded the white marble foyer of the
palace to offer their reviews of the performance and its meaning.
   Latvian deputy Nikolai Neyland said Shevardnadze had bowed to
incessant criticism from hard-line deputies and others who alleged
that the foreign minister was risking a repeat of Afghanistan by
involving the Soviet Union in the Persian Gulf. But he said the
real opposition went deeper.
   ``They weren't attacking Shevardnadze so much as our foreign
policy,'' he said. ``They have been using the Persian Gulf as a
pretext to express dissatisfaction that the Soviet Union has lost
its superpower image, the Soviet Union has lost allies in Eastern
Europe and we supposedly have made too many concessions on arms
control.''
   Roy Medvedev, a deputy and historian, said Shevardnadze had
shown ``weakness'' by caving in to criticism that Soviet leaders
such as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and embattled Prime Minister
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov have endured for months.
   ``If all our leaders reacted to criticism this way, Ryzhkov
would long ago have hung himself, Yeltsin would have shot himself,
and I don't know what fate Gorbachev would have chosen,'' Medvedev
said.
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' said an almost gleeful
Col. Viktor Alksnis. He is the leader of the hard-line ``Soyuz''
faction in parliament and one of the two conservatives Shevardnadze
had identified in the speech as the lawmakers ``with colonels'
stripes'' who were persecuting him.
   ``It's a maneuver,'' offered the other, Col. Nikolai
Petrushenko.
   Before too long, Gorbachev aides began to circulate - in
Washington it would be called ``spin control'' - speaking to
deputies and journalists to try to limit the damage that
Shevardnadze had caused.
   The next act featured Gorbachev, who told the deputies he would
not ``overdramatize'' and then played the betrayed friend, though
his shock at Shevardnadze's announcement seemed genuine enough.
   Rizoali Odzhiev, a hulking deputy from Tadzhikistan who lost a
leg in Afghanistan, savored the high drama as a welcome change from
earlier years.
   ``I don't need to remind you what the scene was like in this
hall 10 years ago,'' said Odzhiev.

   Fewer Americans are getting to own their homes
these days as households resemble less and less the traditional
family image, the Census Bureau said.
   In a report issued Thursday, the bureau said 63.9 percent of
households across the nation owned their homes in 1989, down from
65.6 percent in 1980.
   The report, ``Homeownership Trends in the 1980s,'' said a major
factor in the decline was a drop in ownership rates for non-married
couple families during the decade.
   Home ownership by families headed by an adult without a spouse
present fell from 49.6 percent in 1982 to 46.5 percent in 1989.
   And that drop occurred for both sexes. Home ownership by
families headed by men without a wife present fell from 59.3
percent to 55.7 percent. Home ownership by families headed by a
woman with no husband dropped from 47.1 percent to 44.1 percent.
   A second important change was the rapid growth of non-family
households during the 1980s, compared with families, reported
Census demographer Robert R. Callis.
   Between 1980 and 1989 non-family households increased 27.2
percent nationwide to 27 million, while family households climbed
just 10.6 percent to 66 million.
   Families are much more likely to own their own home than are
non-family households, which often consist of only a single person.
Thus, even though families still are the larger group, the faster
growth of non-family households reduces the overall share of home
owners.
   Callis said other reasons also were factors in the decline,
including the decision by many young people to stay single longer
while pursuing education or careers. Delaying marriage often means
postponing home buying.
   The Northeast, a region of stable population, was the only
region to show an increase in home ownership in the '80s, Callis
noted, rising from 60.8 percent to 62 percent of households.
   Home ownership fell from 69.8 percent to 67.7 percent in the
Midwest; dipped from 68.7 percent to 65.9 percent in the South and
fell from 60 percent to 57.8 percent in the West.
   Here is a state by state list of the percentage of households
that owned their own homes in 1989 and 1984. (Data for individual
states were not available prior to 1984).

<HEAD>Nation Spends More On Health Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health care spending in the United States rose
to a record of more than $604 billion last year, federal officials
reported.
   The amount spent in 1989 added up to roughly $2,400 for every
man, woman and child.
   ``The ability of society to meet other needs is affected by the
growing share of economic resources claimed by health
expenditures,'' Gail Wilensky, chief of the Health Care Financing
Administration, said in releasing the new data Thursday.
   Health spending in 1989 accounted for 11.6 percent of gross
national product, the total of all goods and services produced, and
was 11.1 percent higher than it was in 1988. The gross national
product rose 6.7 percent over the same period.
   The share of GNP also was a record. As recently as 1985, the
share was 10.5 percent.
   Federal spending on health programs in 1989 amounted to 14.7
percent of the total federal budget of about $1.1 trillion, up from
14.1 percent of the previous year's budget.
   Of the total spent on health care last year, 33 percent was paid
by private insurance, 21 percent came from the pockets of
consumers, 17 percent was paid by Medicare and 10 percent was paid
by federal-state Medicaid programs.
   Other government programs put in 15 percent and other private
sources, 4 percent, according to the financing administration's
figures.
   The agency plans to publish a more detailed account of health
spending next month.

<HEAD>Saudis Charged Premium Rate For Mail To U.S. Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service was unable to convince
Saudi Arabia's national airline to waive international mail rates
in favor of the lower fees observed by U.S. carrier for carrying
mail to American troops in the Saudi desert, a postal official
said.
   James E. Orlando, head of international services for the Postal
Service, confirmed that Saudi Arabian Airlines had charged the
service nearly $1.9 million to deliver about 1.05 million pounds of
mail addressed to Desert Shield troops from Sept. 1 to Oct. 17.
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., had cited those figures in a
letter of protest to the Saudi ambassador and the postmaster
general, saying that was too much to pay.
   Orlando said the was reasonable in that it complied with the
rates set by the Universal Postal Union, an international
organization of postal administrators.
   But he noted the Saudis had declined a Postal Service request
that the airline instead observe the mail-rate schedule set by the
Department of Transportation for U.S.-flagged carriers. The UPU
rates are about 2 1/2 times higher than the U.S. rates.
   Gilman, ranking Republican on the House Post Office and Civil
Service Committee, recommended in his letter that the Postal
Service ``work with the Department of Defense and the State
Department to ensure that Saudi Airlines absorb these mail
expenses.''
   Orlando said that ``the whole issue that Congressman Gilman had,
which is whether we should be paying that rate level to the Saudi
government in view of the fact that we're over there defending
them, as far as I'm concerned is a legitimate issue for the
Congress and the administration, but not for the Postal Service.''

<HEAD>Boschwitz Appeal Pays Off for Former Homeless Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz's appeal to colleagues to
hire one of his employees has paid off for the woman, who was
homeless when he hired her two years ago.
   Valerie Gaines, a 36-year-old typist, accepted a job Wednesday
with Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., one of about 20 lawmakers who
responded this week to Boschwitz's letter.
   ``My Christmas is really full,'' said Gaines, who became an
overnight celebrity in Washington in 1989 after Boschwitz hired
her.
   Boschwitz, who was defeated for re-election, leaves office next
month.
   Gaines had had just two job interviews prior to Boschwitz's
appeal.
   ``Valerie hasn't found a new job ... and we need to place her
quickly to avoid another debilitating bout with homelessness,'' the
lawmaker wrote.
   The woman's husband has been disabled by two strokes and cannot
work, she said. The couple has two daughters, ages 6 and 8.
   Gaines worked for then-Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., for two years
but lost her job when he retired in 1988. During the three weeks
she was jobless along with her husband, their landlord evicted them
and their belongings were stolen.
   Boschwitz's staff hired Gaines not knowing that the address she
gave was that of a homeless shelter. She now lives in an apartment
in suburban Maryland.

   Two white supremacist ``skinheads'' who shot a
black man at random then laughed as he lay dying have been
sentenced to life in prison.
   Matthew Faessel, 19, and Michael Stringer, 18, convicted of
first-degree murder last October, were sentenced Thursday in the
Dec. 10, 1988, slaying of Tony Montgomery.
   They received life terms for killing Montgomery and 18 years for
conspiracy to commit murder and shooting into an occupied building.
District Judge Robert Schouweiler ordered that the sentences be
served consecutively. Faessel and Stringer will be eligible for
parole in 26 years.
   Faessel blamed the killing on alcohol and drug abuse and
apologized to Montgomery's family.
   ``I hope they feel justice has been served,'' he said.
   Angela Stanley testified that she drove Faessel and Stringer
around Reno in search of a black person to kill after the two
became enraged when a woan at a party attended by other neo-Nazi
skinheads said she once had been raped by a black man.
   She testified that as she drove past Montgomery, Stringer rolled
down a window and Faessel fired the fatal shot from the back seat.
She said the two laughed as Montgomery lay dying in the front yard
of his sister's home.
   Stanley, 18, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   The Mauss triplets were so tiny at
birth 90 years ago that they spent their first few hours in a
makeshift incubator - their father's shoebox placed in the warming
oven of a coal stove.
   Maybe it was that odd start in Murray, Utah, on Oct. 16, 1900,
that instilled in Vinal, Velma and Vilda Mauss the sense of humor
they believe is a key to their near-record longevity.
   ``Vinal sounds the same as vinyl, but I came first,'' Vinal said
Thursday.
   ``My sisters always had a lot of fun together,'' he said. ``They
liked to confuse their teachers by switching seats. I had no
trouble telling them apart, but my father sometimes got them mixed
up.''
   Mauss' son-in-law, LeGrande ``Eli'' Eliason, said when the
triplets get together ``it's like a circus.''
   ``They love to laugh and tell jokes,'' he said.
   The trio is still going strong, says Vinal Mauss, as they
approach the Guinness Book of Records' mark for oldest triplets.
The Massachusetts-born Caughlin triplets - Faith, Hope and Charity
- were 93 in 1962 when the first died.
   ``We are trying to beat that if we can,'' said Vinal, a hardy,
dapper man who looks 20 years younger than he is and still works
several hours a day as owner of a newspaper distribution business
in Walnut Creek, 25 miles east of San Francisco.
   Vinal, the oldest of the triplets by 10 minutes, weighed only 3
pounds at birth. His kid sisters were 2{ pounds each. But there
weren't any real incubators in Murray, Utah, then, so Vinal said
their doctor put them in their father's padded shoebox and placed
it in the coal stove's warming oven.
   The three aren't quite sure how they got their unusual names.
Family legend has it a friend of their mother heard the names
somewhere, and in the excitement or exhaustion of having triplets
their parents agreed to them.
   Believed to be the first surviving triplets in the Western
United States, they were curiosities who drew crowds when they were
displayed in a booth behind ropes at a Utah state fair in 1907.
   ``They sold pictures of us for 25 cents each,'' Mauss said.
   They stayed close over the years, and wrote each other often
when Mauss served as a Mormon missionary in Japan from 1922 to 1924
and head of the mission there from 1949 to 1953.
   The sisters, who live near each other in Midvale, Utah, near
Salt Lake City, stay in close touch with their brother.
   Mauss, a former bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints, worked at one time or another as a real estate
broker, insurance salesman and funeral director before getting into
newspaper distribution. He also played semipro baseball in Salt
Lake City and basketball on a Mormon missionary team.
   He claims to be a man of no vices, but not for lack of trying.
He sampled coffee once, but couldn't stand the taste. A cigar made
him sick. A glass of whiskey made him throw up.
   But he doesn't sound at all like a man who has missed anything.
   ``My only regret is that I didn't get a higher education,'' he
said. ``I hoped at one time to be a doctor. I finished high school
and had one year of college - night school at Berkeley.
   ``But I've enjoyed my life. I'm still enjoying it.''

<HEAD>Amtrak Engineers Suspended Without Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two Amtrak engineers involved in the Dec.
12 train crash in Boston have been suspended without pay pending an
investigation, and a signal near the crash site has been changed.
   An ``all clear'' track signal near Boston's Back Bay Station has
been changed to require inbound trains to brake to 30 mph, Amtrak
spokeswoman Sue Martin said Thursday.
   A control system will automatically stop trains that are not
slowed, she said.
   Amtrak said in a statement that engineer trainee Richard
Abramson 41, of Trumbull, Conn., and chief engineer Willis
Copeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., would be ``removed from engine
service.''
   But Martin said the suspension was from all duties without pay
until the investigation is completed.
   ``This is a pretty routine procedure,'' Martin said. ``Any time
that we suspect that an employee or employees may have contributed
to an accident, then they're routinely suspended pending an
investigation. This does not mean that they're guilty.''
   The new yellow and green signal was installed just west of
Ruggles Station, about a mile and a quarter from Back Bay Station,
Martin said.
   The signal was previously green-only, permitting the engineer to
reach the maximum legal speed of 100 mph.
   ``We've basically taken a step that will add an extra layer of
protection,'' Martin said.
   If the engineer does not apply enough brake pressure to slow
down after passing the signal, an automatic control system will
brake the train and bring it to a complete stop, Martin said.
   Amtrak also said it was telling its employees that only federal
authorities can remove train recorders that monitor speed and
braking.
   Amtrak officials inadvertently prevented a clear reading of the
tape by recording on it an electronic tone to mark the last five
miles of the trip, federal investigators have said.
   The Night Owl, traveling at more than twice the speed limit,
derailed and slammed into a crowded commuter train, injuring 267
people.
   The probe, Amtrak said, is focusing on ``what, if any,
responsibility they (the engineers) may have had in the cause of
the derailment.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board also is investigating.
The NTSB is focusing on whether the engineers were negligent in
their operation of the train or whether, as the engineers maintain,
the locomotive brakes were malfunctioning.
   The Night Owl was traveling at 110 mph at some point in the
mile-and-one-fifth stretch of track before Back Bay Station,
according to ``black box'' data retrieved from a tape in the
locomotive's cab.
   The maximum speed up to a point about a half mile from the
station was 100 mph. Near the station, the speed limit was 30 mph.
   When the 10-car train derailed along a curve, it was traveling
77 mph, more than twice the speed limit.
   A review of the information taken from the data recorder showed
that the engineers applied the brakes at least once before the
crash, the NTSB said.
   If the investigation finds that Copeland and Abramson were not
responsible for the accident, they will return to work and their
back pay will be restored, Martin said.
   Both engineers were hospitalized as a result of the accident.
Copeland was released from Boston City Hospital on Dec. 17.
According to Martin, he was transferred to a hospital in New Haven.
Boston City would not confirm the transfer. Abramson was released
from St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Russ raked Guam today with wind up to
135 mph and pummeled the U.S. territory's southern coast with huge
waves that caused severe flooding.
   No serious injuries or deaths were reported, but power and water
service were disrupted in many areas and police reported some
looting, Ken Booth of Guam Cable TV said.
   The storm was the strongest to hit this western Pacific island
in more than a decade. Its eye moved within 15 miles of Guam's
southern coast early today, and wind hit 135 mph in the south and
90 mph with gusts of 115 mph in central and northern areas, said
Lt. Diane Edson of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   Fifteen minor injuries and no deaths were reported, Booth said.
   ``It was quite a blow, but not as bad as had been expected,'' he
said.
   Gov. Joseph Ada said about 500 families in the southern town of
Agat were displaced, Booth reported. About 2,500 people sought
shelter during the storm.
   Power and water service remained down in many areas, and
officials said it would be three days before full power was
restored, according to Booth.
   Booth said police reported looting in some areas. The duty-free
store in the central town of Tumon reported being robbed of
$250,000 in Rolex watches and an undetermined amount of other
jewelry. There were reports of looting in other areas as well. No
arrests were made.
   Waves cresting as high as 24 feet caused severe flooding in
southern Guam, uncovering corpses in the cemetery in the town of
Inarajan, Booth said.
   Several large concrete utility poles installed after the last
major typhoon, Pamela in 1976, snapped in half from the force of
the waves, Booth said.
   Russ damaged or destroyed only the few wooden homes remaining on
the island. Concrete structures built after Pamela escaped serious
damage.
   Ada said he planned to ask for federal disaster relief
assistance.
   Booth said the capital of Agana looked like a ``war zone,'' with
trees, traffic lights, poles and signs strewn about and flooding
everywhere.
   The storm center was out to sea and headed toward the
Philippines with sustained winds of 145 mph and gusts of 175 mph,
Edson said. It was moving at 15 mph, but was expected to weaken
before it reached the Philippines.

   More than 1 million Iraqis fled their homes
in the capital today in a major evacuation drill to test the
population's readiness in the event of war in the Persian Gulf.
   The civil defense exercise got under way on schedule at 7 a.m.
with air raid sirens blaring across the eastern part of Baghdad,
which is divided by the Tigris river.
   The drill was expected to involve nearly 2 million people. But
residents said nearly half stayed home.
   Iraqi preparations for war have increased since the U.N.
Security Council late last month authorized military force to drive
the Iraqi army from Kuwait if it does not leave the conquered
emirate by Jan. 15.
   With the first siren today, families began pouring into the
streets, some ran to civil defense centers set up by the government
and others jumped into their cars and sped away.
   Hundreds of buses waiting at the civil defense centers took
evacuees to points about 10 miles to the north, east and south of
the city.
   The evacuees carried blankets, food and personal documents.
   The drill was expected to last all day.
   On Thursday, Basra, Iraq's second-largest city and the closest
to the border with occupied Kuwait, was evacuated in a similar
exercise. Residents there, said almost the entire population of 1
million people participated in that drill.
   Among other war preparations in the past couple of weeks, there
have been instructions to build bomb shelters throughout the
capital, and courses in civil defense and first-aid are being
pushed by the government.
   Government officials have been instructing the population in
public announcements to leave their houses carefully locked during
the evacuation drills. Police cars were to patrol the city to
protect private property.
   Businesses and all government offices were closed today, the
Moslem sabbath, so the exercise did not affect commerce.
   On Saturday, the western part of the city is to be evacuated in
similar drills. The population, also about 2 million, will be moved
north, west and south of the city.
   Government offices also were expected to be closed on Saturday
for the drills.

<HEAD>Report: Iraqi Missile Test Catches U.S. By Surprise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi test firing of three medium-range
missiles took U.S. military officials by surprise, a newspaper
reported today.
   Preparations and the first launch of the Dec. 2 test were
complete before American satellites and sensors monitoring the
tense Persian Gulf region noticed it, even though U.S. officials
had thought they could detect any Iraqi fueling and prelaunch
programs. the Los Angeles Times reported.
   ``We had no advance warning,'' said an unidentified
administration official quoted by the Times.
   Iraq had warned commercial airliners to keep out of its airspace
before the test, but gave no reason.
   The warning prompted Israel and U.S. officials to prepare their
air forces to respond to an attack, the newspaper said.
   ``A lot of people were in their cockpits ready to go,'' the
Times quoted one official as saying.
   The official said Joseph C. Wilson IV, the chief U.S. diplomat
in Baghdad, received a telephone cll from the State Department in
Washington after the first missile was fired.
   The call reportedly informed him that ``the balloon is going up
- this is no drill.'' Later, officials reported the launch was a
test.
   The Times said the missiles were launched from a site near
Basra, in southeastern Iraq, and traveled more than 400 miles west
toward Israel, landing in a remote part of the Iraqi desert.
   If they had been fired southward, they could have hit U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia, and if launched from western Iraq they
could have hit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the newspaper said.
   U.S. officials said the missiles were fired from an area that
was not being monitored, but Seth Carus of the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy said it was odd that Basra wouldn't be under
surveillance because short-range missiles could be launched at U.S.
troops from there.
   Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops have been sent to the
Persian Gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.

<TEXT>
   The closer their countries to the Soviet
Union, the more worried leaders seemed to be by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation.
   One exception was the hard-line Communist government of China,
whose Foreign Ministry would say only that Shevardnadze's dramatic
announcement Thursday was ``an internal affair of the Soviet Union.
We will continue to develop friendly neighbor relations with the
Soviet Union.''
   Elsewhere, the announced resignation of the man who helped
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev end the Cold War provoked
apprehensions about the future of the Soviet Union and its leader.
Gorbachev said Shevardnadze agreed to stay on until a successor is
chosen.
   Germany, fearing that failure of the Soviet president's reforms
could endanger East European stability, was especially nervous
about Shevardnadze's resignation announcement.
   ``We can only hope that the reforms are carried out. They are
good for the Soviet Union and they are good for the relationship
between our people and for developments in Europe,'' said German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Germans credit the Soviets, in particular Gorbachev and his
foreign minister, with clearing the way for eastern Europe's
sweeping reforms and German unification.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, said he is
confident of final Soviet approval of the treaty guaranteeing
German sovereignty, despite the resignation of one of Moscow's
leading reformers.
   Genscher and Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, urgently
appealed for an international effort to bolster Gorbachev's reform
program with financial aid.
   Dumas said he hoped Shevardnadze's ``cry of alarm'' would be
heard.
   ``It will serve as a warning to Western countries and others who
are dragging their feet over aid which must be given,'' he said.
Dumas said Shevardnadze had privately shared with him his concerns
about the future of the Soviet Union but noted ``this is the first
time that he says it publicly.''
   The foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community, which
recently pledged $2.8 billion in aid to the Soviets, received
Shevardnadze's ``with regret.''
   A statement said the EC nations ``express their firmest hope
that the resignation ... will not entail changes in Soviet policy
which might call into question the significant results thus far
achieved in international relations ... in the direction of
disarmament and peace.''
   In Poland, which has a 700-mile border with the Soviet Union,
Foreign Minister Krzysztof Subiszewski said the internal situation
there can ``in many respects ... cause anxiety.''
   ``The decision of Eduard Shevardnadze can be treated as a
warning. Internal policy, especially that of a superpower, finds
reflection in foreign policy,'' he said.
   The prime minister of Soviet Lithuania, Kazimiera Prunskiene,
told a news conference in Tokyo today that her independence-minded
republic is alarmed by Shevardnadze's resignation.
   She said it may mean that progress achieved by the
pro-perestroika forces is being turned back by conservative forces,
including sections of the Communist Party and the military.
   ``His resignation may lead to a situation that is unfavorable
for Lithuanian independence,'' she said.
   There was a worldwide outpouring of praise for Shevardnadze, a
welcome guest in many capitals.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told reporters:
``On a personal basis, I regret this. He is a personal friend and
he was very supportive of the United Nations.''
   Vatican Radio hailed Shevardnadze as the ``great architect of
the Soviet diplomacy that contributed to ending the Cold War.''
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said he was ``really
surprised by the sudden announcement. I would like to watch the
situation calmly.''
   Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said today that
Shevardnadze's resignation raises matters of ``immediate worry''
for Gorbachev's leadership.
   ``The optimistic view is that it could act as a warning shot to
galvanize the reformers, there does seem to be at least an attempt
by Mr. Shevardnadze to do just that by the style and the
forecefulness of his resignation speech,'' Evans said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the outgoing
minister his friend, but said Gorbachev had assured him that Soviet
foreign policy would continue on course.
   American Gen. John R. Galvin, NATO's military commander in
Europe, said bluntly: ``The Soviets certainly face a bleak winter.
I hope what we're hearing now doesn't make it any worse.''
   ``All of us in the West want to see the Soviet people continue
on a track that will lead to full democracy, free enterprise and
respect for human rights,'' Galvin said. ``But this has to be done
in a way that maintains order without sacrificing democratic
principles.''

<HEAD>New Plume of Steam, Ash from Mount St. Helens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant ash plume belched from Mount St. Helens,
but scientists said it didn't appear to portend a new eruption of
molten rock.
   Wind carred the ash toward Portland, Ore., 53 miles to the
southwest, prompting United Airlines to cancel 21 flights in and
out of that city Thursday night. Normal service was to resume this
morning, United customer service supervisor Fred Von Pegert said.
   Port of Portland spokesman Darrel Buttice said the airport
remained open Thursday night and the 11 other airlines were flying.
   The 8,366-foot mountain blew a column of light gray ash and
steam 23,000 feet into the air Thursday afternoon, about 30 minutes
after a small explosion occurred on the lava dome in the volcano's
crater, said Michael Doukas, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at
its Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver.
   Doukas said it was similar to the latest volcanic ``burp,'' on
Nov. 5, when a plume of steam and ash rose 30,000 feet into the
sky. Similar bursts occurred last December and January.
   Doukas said those bursts are significant only in underscoring
that Mount St. Helens remains an active volcano.
   Scientists have theorized such bursts come from either gases
bubbling out of solution in molten rock beneath the mountain, or
from rain and snowmelt percolating down to hot areas and bursting
into steam.
   The volcano's last significant eruption was on March 19, 1982,
when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork of the
Toutle River. Since then, the mountain has had a series of
``dome-building'' eruptions in which the mountain quietly adds lava
to the heap in its crater. The last of those was in October 1986.
   The mountain's cataclysmic May 18, 1980, eruption killed 57
people and blew off the top 1,300 feet of the once-symmetrical
peak, a lava dome dating to about the 16th century.

<HEAD>U.S. Company Helps Japanese Shout Away Woes of 1990</HEAD>

   A group of Japanese have abandoned their usual
reserve to shout away the frustrations of 1990 in a contest
sponsored by an American cough drop company.
   ``If YOU want a war, YOU go!'' screamed Yoshihiko Kato, the
36-year-old father of three who won the contest with a ear-blasting
115.8 decibel bellow - louder than a passing train.
   ``President Hussein, please pay my gasoline bill!'' roared
Yoshihiro Yamanashi, 30.
   ``I want a girlfriend. I'll do anything to get one!'' wailed
Takeshi Oohashi, 23, who said he has never had a girlfriend.
   Te self-employed Kato, who said he probably primed his vocal
cords shouting at his children, won the 100,000 yen ($740) grand
prize of the 10th Annual Halls Year-End Loud Voice Contest
Thursday.
   The Adams Confectionary Products Division of Warner-Lambert KK,
the contest organizers, asked contestants to shout their feelings
about what happened in 1990 in keeping with the Japanese custom of
``toshi wasure,'' or forgetting the past year.
   Adams manufactures Hall's cough drops and all contestants
received a package of the lozenges to soothe their throats after
the contest.
   The company challenged the shouters to top a ringing telephone
(70 decibels) or, if possible, damage a few eardrums (150
decibels). Decibel readings on a sound meter, facial expressions
and gestures all counted.
   Kato's scream registered 115.8 decibels, more than 15 percent
louder than the roar of a train passing overhead on an elevated
railroad.
   Kato didn't explain what he meant by his yell. Some thought it
was directed against the Japanese government, which heeded strong
opposition and dropped a proposal to send troops for non-combat
roles with multinational forces deployed against Iraq.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was the target of several of the
54 contestants, watched by a few hundred chuckling shoppers during
lunch hour at a Tokyo shopping center.
   Hiroshi Okawa, 32, a company employee, pocketed the $225 second
prize with the 114.2-decibel plea, ``The day after a typhoon I
crashed my car and I want the money to get it repaired!''
   Kazuo Kazama, 28 and unemployed, won the $150 third prize with a
cheer for his favorite race horse: ``Go Oguri.''
   In a ``unique'' category, with a $150 prize, Miyako Shimizu, a
53-year-old art teacher, won with the help of a picture she had
painted of the popular bride of Emperor Akihito's second son,
Prince Akishino. She screeched, ``I want to give this picture to
Princess Kiko!''
   The men's ``unique'' prize went to Shigeru Uchida, a 35-year-old
government employee, who yelled, ``7,7,7!'' his lucky numbers from
pachinko, the Japanese pinball game.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Corrective Surgery for Boy Whose Religion
Forbids It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Southeast Asian boy shouldn't be forced
to have surgery because his family's fear of arousing angry spirits
would do him more harm than skipping operations to fix his
clubfeet, a judge ruled.
   Superior Court Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill ruled Thursday the
potential psychological and physical harm to Kou Xiong, a
7-year-old Hmong refugee, outweighs efforts to correct the clubfoot
condition that doctors say could leave him unable to walk.
   O'Neill, who had ordered the surgery 10 months ago, said he
reversed himself Thursday because psychiatrist David A. Fox said
the trauma of going against traditional Hmong religious beliefs
could kill Kou and others in his family.
   Fox, a psychiatrist at Valley Children's Hospital in this
central California city of 350,000, spoke with a Hmong shaman in
studying Kou's case.
   ``The system clearly has done the best it can for this child and
family,'' O'Neill said. ``The child's family must now do what is
best for themselves.''
   Kou's parents, Ger and Houa Vue Xiong, oppose surgery because
they believe spirits gave their son clubfeet as punishment for a
wrong committed by an ancestor. They believe Kou's younger brothers
were born with cleft palates because he received care for his feet
at a Thailand refugee camp after the family fled the mountains of
Laos.
   Kou, who was carried into court by his father Thursday, walked
with a halting gait during a previous court appearance.
   ``I think the judge or everybody has to know more about people
before making a judgment,'' Ger Xiong said through an interpreter
after O'Neill announced his ruling. ``They have to respect ...
respect the people. We are different.''
   A reclusive hill people from northern Laos, many Hmongs had
little contact with the outside world before joining a
U.S.-supported campaign against communist insurgents in the early
1970s. When Laos' pro-U.S. government fell, thousands of Hmongs
fled to the United States.
   ``This operation was seen by the family as having long-term
effects which could cause them disease and financial disaster,''
said the family's lawyer, Joe Reich.
   If the surgery had been forced on Kou, Reich said, the family
would have rejected him and welfare officials could not have placed
him with another Hmong family.
   All 18 Hmong clans in the United States had supported the
family's opposition to surgery.

<HEAD>With PM-UN-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq today dismissed as meager a U.N.
Security Council resolution deploring Israel's plans to deport
Palestinians and calling for monitoring of the safety of Arabs
under occupation.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told the official Iraqi News
Agency that the resolution ``highlighted the double standards
applied by the United States and imposed on the Security Council,
which has turned into a tool manipulated by the United States.''
   Iraq has proposed a settlement of its 4-month-old invasion and
occupation of Kuwait linked to an Israeli withdrawal from occupied
Arab territories. Washington and its allies in the Persian Gulf
standoff rejected the linkage.
   In his statement, monitored in Nicosia, Aziz said: ``After weeks
of shameful maneuvering, the council adopted a meager resolution on
one of the most dangerous issues from which the region and the
entire world has suffered for many years.
   ``A more meager statement was issued by that council, binding
the Zionist entity (Israel) to absolutely nothing. All that
compared to 12 arbitrary resolutions adopted in the past four
months by the same council against Iraq,'' he said.
   President Bush's policy, Aziz said, is designed to protect only
``Bush's partners and his agents among the corrupt oil sheiks for
whom he sheds crocodile tears.''
   The Security Council vote on the resolution had been postponed
several times in recent weeks as Washington sought a text that
would not be interpreted as a concession to Iraq.
   While U.S. approval of the resolution Thursday was a break from
traditional American support of Israel, a veto would have
jeopardized the international coalition arrayed against Iraq.
   Washington agreed to the text only after a paragraph endorsing
an international Mideast conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli
conflict was removed.
   A call for a properly timed and structured international
conference on the 42-year-old conflict was contained in a
non-binding Council statement.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against other major
currencies in early trading today. Gold fell.
   Dealers said the dollar was helped by uncertainty over the
political future of the Soviet Union after Thursday's resignation
of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The dollar is seen as a safe haven currency in times of turmoil.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.12 yen to a closing 135.70 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 135.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   -1.5125 German marks, up from 1.4997
   -1.3015 Swiss francs, up from 1.2880
   -5.1418 French francs, up from 5.1035

   -1,139.50 Italian lire, up from 1,132.25
   -1.1595 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1593
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9035, compared
with $1.9080 late Thursday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$383.25 per ounce at midmorning, from $385.25 bid per ounce late
Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $383.25, down from $385.00 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at a bid
$382.30.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.16 a troy ounce,
from Thursday's $4.18.

<HEAD>Chilled Milk? Dairy Farmers Try to Keep Cows From Udderly Freezing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Steevens is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To beat the lack of heat, some dairy
farmers are using cow brassieres and hair dryers to keep their
animals from udderly freezing.
   ``You've got to try to keep a cold cow comfortable, or you're
going to lose a lot of milk production,'' said Barry Steevens, a
University of Missouri dairy specialist.
   Today's forecast called for more cold weather, with highs around
zero.
   Some Missouri farmers use nylon mesh udder supports on animals
that calved recently and have udders swollen with milk, Steevens
said. Others use hair dryers and towels to keep moisture off the
animals.
   Dairy farmers are better prepared than last year, when a
surprise Christmas Eve deep freeze brought temperatures of 20
degrees below zero, chilled further by 24 mph winds, he said.
   ``It was pure hell,'' Steevens said.

   Severe cold remained locked over much of the country, bringing
snow and high winds while rain was widespread elsewhere today, the
first official day of winter.
   Snow fell from the Great Lakes to the California coast, where a
rare flurry dusted seaside Monterey. Temperatures ranged from the
80s in southern Florida and Texas to a wind-chilled 80 below zero
in Montana.
   Freezing rain, thunderstorms and possible tornadoes were
forecast for several states in the South and Mississippi Valley
region. Winter storm warnings and advisories were posted throughout
the Rockies, northern Plains and the West.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 89 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.

<HEAD>Assembly Upholds Chamorro Veto, Accepts Smaller Army Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly early today
sustained President Violeta Chamorro's veto of a bill that would
have drastically cut the already slashed budget of the
Sandinista-controlled military.
   Mrs. Chamorro has said deeper cuts in spending for the military,
a stronghold of the leftist Sandinistas she succeeded in April,
could push the country into ``chaos and a bloodbath.''
   The Sandinistas have staged crippling strikes against the
conservative government's moves to dismantle the socialist economy
and institute market-oriented reform.
   The vote today followed weeks of bickering that had placed Mrs.
Chamorro in the position of fending off the conservative deputies
she is technically allied with, while defending her adversaries,
the Sandinistas.
   After debate that lasted until 3 a.m. today, legislators voted
69-21 to sustain Mrs. Chamorro's veto.
   The 51 deputies of Mrs. Chamorro's National Opposition Union, or
UNO, had voted unanimously last week to shave $19.6 million from
her proposed $78.6 million budget for the army - less than half the
budget the military had requested.
   But 29 members of the coalition, plus one independent deputy,
today joined the 39 Sandinista deputies in the 92-member assembly
in sustaining the veto after Mrs. Chamorro agreed to cut only $8.5
million from her earlier defense budget proposal. One deputy did
not vote.
   She also agreed to name a civilian defense minister by 1993. The
defense job has been held by Gen. Humberto Ortega, brother of
former President Daniel Ortega, who Mrs. Chamorro succeeded in
April.
   UNO leaders want Mrs. Chamorro to sack Gen. Ortega and the issue
was one of the grievances listed by former Contra rebels who have
rioted, attacked police stations and blocked roads in recent
months.
   Mrs. Chamorro has decided to keep Gen. Ortega as defense
minister, said deputy Luis Humberto Guzman, head of the budget
committee that considered the defense vote.
   ``She said Humberto Ortega is the only man who has the moral
authority and the capability to effect the reductions'' in the army
without creating a backlash from angry Sandinistas, Guzman said.
   The Sandinistas, who ruled the country from 1979 until their
defeat in last February's elections, still command a mass movement
capable of bringing the country to its knees with strikes. They
also have most of the guns and bullets.
   But Mrs. Chamorro also agreed to reduce the armed forces, now
numbering 28,434 troops, to about 16,000 over the coming years,
Guzman said.
   The military had 100,000 men and women under arms when she came
to power April 25. Once the largest force in Central America, the
Sandinista People's Army is now the fourth biggest, after those of
El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
   The army's budget was $190 million this year, the last budget
the Sandinista government approved, and military officials
presented a 1991 budget proposal of $160 million.
   Mrs. Chamorro chopped it to $78.6 million, and it fell to $70
million under her agreement with conservative deputies.

<HEAD>Protest March Marks U.S. Invasion Anniversary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 people, including backers
of ousted Gen. Manuel Noriega and relatives of people killed by
American bombs, marched through the capital dressed in black to
mark one year since the U.S. invasion.
   The marchers shouted anti-government slogans and burned a U.S.
flag during the four-hour, five-mile march that began Thursday in
the downtown business district and ended in Chorrillo, the
neighborhood where Noriega's headquarters were located.
   Heavy U.S. bombing of the area caused most of the civilian
deaths and left more than a thousand homeless.
   The government, which was installed after the invasion, said
Dec. 20 could be neither a holiday nor a day of mourning.
   ``It was an invasion and no Panamanian likes to see his country
invaded, with the consequences of deaths and injuries,'' said
Foreign Minister Julio Linares.
   ``Neither can we say it is a day of national mourning because it
liberated us from dictatorship,'' he said.
   He called the date one of ``national reflection.''
   ``Those who should reflect are the accomplices of the
intervention,'' responded Isabel Corro, spokeswoman for the
Association of Families of Martyrs of the North American Invasion
of Panama.
   ``They took power at the cost of thousands of disappeared and
fallen,'' she said.
   President Guillermo Endara, who won May 1989 elections only to
have the results nullified by Noriega, was sworn in shortly after
the invasion began.
   The Panamanian Human Rights Committee has increased its casualty
figures from the invasion over the past week even as the U.S. Army
Southern Command revised its death toll downward.
   The rights group, which had said 385 died in the invasion, now
claims 403 people were killed or disappeared. It gave no reason for
the change.
   The Army, which had recorded 314 military and 202 civilian
deaths, now says 345 died, including U.S. and Panamanian soldiers
and civilian.
   The invasion left 1,243 families homeless. Of those 596 remain
at a refugee shelter awaiting housing.
   As the march passed a prison in Chorrillo, guards fired guns
into the air to quiet a disturbance by inmates, authorities said.
Marchers dispersed, then regrouped to burn a U.S. flag.
   ``We burned it because they burned our relatives that way the
day of the invasion,'' said a Chorillo resident who asked not to be
identified.
   Most Panamanians initially were exhuberant over the end of 21
years of military rule and the overthrow of Noriega, who is jailed
in Miami awaiting trial on drug charges.
   But Endara's support has been weakening and the U.S. military's
continued role irritates nationalists.
   About 10,000 U.S. soldiers are based in Panama to provide
security for the Panama Canal. At Endara's request, American troops
put down a Dec. 5 police revolt that Endara described as a coup
attempt.

   News of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze's resignatio sent the Tokyo stock market tumbling
today while strengthening the dollar against the Japanese yen.
   Stock traders said Shevardnadze's surprise announcement shook
the stock market with worries about domestic turmoil in the Soviet
Union.
   The market also was rocked by rumors, later denied, that Iraq is
planning to pull its troops out of Kuwait, they said.
   ``Since yesterday, there was also a technical correction,'' said
Haruo Ueno, manager of stock trading at Wako Securities.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
351.84 points Thursday, lost 405.34 more points, or 1.6 percent, to
close at 24,119.06. Trading was moderate at 350 million shares.
   Market declines in London, New York and West Germany and the
weakening yen also discouraged traders, said Shigeru Akiba, head of
equity trading for UBS Philips and Drew International.
   ``Basically, sentiment is not so good,'' he said.
   Currency traders also said the market reacted mostly to worries
about stability in the Soviet Union.
   Political worries tend to strengthen the dollar, which is often
seen as a safe currency in times of turmoil.
   The dollar closed at 135.70 yen, up 1.12 yen from Thursday's
close of 134.58 yen. Trading ranged between 135.20 yen and 136.35
yen.
   Except for transactions by companies, such as exporters, with
specialized foreign exchange needs, the approaching holiday chased
many participants out of the market temporarily, traders said.
   ``Today, there were not so many market participants, so the
dollar fluctuated a lot,'' said Tadashi Sazaki, assistant general
manager of the foreign exchange and international treasury division
at the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Also today, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said that
although the economy shows some signs of slowdown, inflationary
pressures are still strong because of effects of higher oil prices
and the tight labor market. He said the government is planning no
change in monetary policy for now.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 86.92 points as of 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Thursday's 87.97-point close. Their yield stood at 7.115
percent, up from 7.075 percent Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Israel's foreign minister said today the United
States showed weakness by catering to Arab desires for a U.N.
Security Council resolution condemning Israel, but Iraq dismissed
the measure as ``meager.''
   The resolution, approved by a 15-0 vote in the council Thursday,
urges Israel to halt deportation of Palestinians from the West Bank
and Gaza and calls on the United Nations to monitor the safety of
Palestinians there.
   U.S. backing for the resolution was seen as an effort to
preserve the Arab coalition against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
It was the third time in two months that Washington has failed to
exercise its veto powers to shield Israel.
   Although the resoultion referred to land occupied by Israel
since 1967 as ``Palestinian territories,'' U.S. Ambassador Thomas
R. Pickering kept out language linking the Palestinian issue to
efforts to resolve the gulf crisis. Saddam has consistently tried
to link efforts to resolve both issues.
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said today that the United
States had succumbed to Arab pressure.
   ``There is a weakness among the Americans that is brought about
by America's dependency on the anti-Saddam coalition and by the
American obsession that if it is objective and stands by Israel,
the coalition is liable to be weakened,'' Levy told Israel army
radio.
   But he praised the Americans for keeping out of the resolution
any mention of an international peace conference that would deal
with all disputes in the Middle East, including the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   Such a conference, opposed by Israel as biased toward the Jewish
state, is only cited in a non-binding addendum to the resolution.
   For their part, Palestinian and Iraqi officials claimed that the
resolution was too weak.
   The vote ``highlighted the double standards applied by the
United States and imposed on the Security Council, which has turned
into a tool manipulated by the United States,'' said Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz.
   ``After weeks of shameful maneuvering, the council adopted a
meager resolution on one of the most dangerous issues from which
the region and the entire world has suffered for many years,'' he
said.
   His statement was monitored in Nicosia.
   Palestinian officials also complained that the measure did not
do enough to protect residents of the Israeli-held territories,
because it did not mention the international conference and failed
to provide specific steps for protecting Palestinians.
   But the resolution was the first step in a ``linkage'' between
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and Israeli rule in the territories,
they claimed.
   ``The linkage between the two problems is that all the U.N.
resolutions must be respected,'' said Jamal Tarifi, a pro-PLO
lawyer from Gaza.
   Israel deported four leaders of a fundamentalist Palestinian
group last week, the latest of 60 deportations during the
three-year Palestinian uprising.
   Israeli officials had halted the practice for more than a year,
however, partly because of strong U.S. complaints.
   The resolution urges U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to use existing personnel in the region to monitor the
safety of Palestinians.
   Two U.N. organizations operate in the region. One is the Truce
Supervision Organization, which oversees the truce between Israel
and Arab states. The second is the Relief and Works Agency, which
provides medical care, education and other relief to 900,000
Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Pickering told the council the two U.N. agencies have ``separate
and well-defined mandates. No activity should be undertaken that
would alter these mandates ... and we would oppose any attempt to
alter them.''
   Since the United States holds a veto in the Security Council, it
would be impossible for either the relief or truce agency to begin
officially monitoring the Palestinians.
   Nevertheless, some staffers from the relief agency already act
as unofficial monitors in the occupied lands, rushing to trouble
spots to prevent or report on human rights abuses by Israeli
soldiers.
   The U.N. relief agency has complained about frequent harassment,
arrests and beatings of employees, most of whom are Palestinians.
   Israel claims the U.N. teams' monitoring is politically
motivated to weaken Israeli control and increase international
control.

   Thousands of Romanians today marked
the first anniversary of their pro-democracy revolution by holding
demonstrations against the government that replaced the fallen
Communist dictatorship.
   About 10,000 people gathered in Bucharest's University Square,
chanting slogans against President Ion Iliescu.
   In the western city of Timisoara, birthplace of the violent
revolt that drove Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu from power,
15,000 workers held the latest protest in more than a week of
anti-government demonstrations.
   Protesters chanted ``Down with Iliescu'' at University Square.
   The square was ringed with blue police vans, but authorities did
not interfere with the demonstration.
   During last year's revolution, protesters in the square took on
the police and the army on Dec. 21 and some of them were killed.
The next day, hundreds of thousands rallied in the streets of
Bucharest, forcing Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, to flee. They
were captured by the army and tried and executed Dec. 25.
   The square has since been the site of repeated anti-government
protests, some ending in violent clashes with police.
   The two weeks leading up to the revolution's anniversary have
been marked by strikes and protests of the governing National
Salvation Front.
   The Front has lost popularity since introducing economic
reforms, including price increases designed to introduce a market
economy.
   In an address to Parliament today, President Iliescu accused
government critics of ``a systematic attempt to distort the
intentions of the revolution to their own intersts.''
   He said the Front, which won May elections and has ruled since
the revolution, must press ahead with planned economic reforms,
despite growing opposition throughout the country.
   More than 100,000 students and hundreds of professors are
estimated to be on strike nationwide. There have been isolated
strikes by truck drivers, teachers, medical workers and others in
various parts of the country.
   A strike by navigators at the state airline, Tarom, has
paralyzed all internal flights and stranded many international
travelers in Romania.
   In Timisoara, the site of clashes on that preceded the
revolution, 75,000 workers from most of the town's industries have
been on strike for a week.
   At a rally of 15,000 workers Thursday, Claudio Iordache, vice
president of the National Salvation Front, announced his
resignation after being booed from the speaker's balcony on Opera
Square.
   Iliescu told Parliament that 1991 would be ``a decisive year for
all our reforms.'' He said, ``We must prove we are ready for a ...
democracy.''

<TEXT>
   A jury has ruled that both the city and former
New York Yankee infielder Andre Robertson were responsible for a
1983 car crash in which a former ballerina was paralyzed.
   After the Thursday verdict, State Supreme Court Justice Ira
Gammerman instructed the jurors to return today to determine how
much money Shanikwa Dawn Nowlin should get for her injuries and
future costs of medicine, medical equipment and health care.
   Nowlin, who at 14 had been the youngest member of the Dance
Theatre of Harlem, is seeking a total of $20 million.
   The jury found that the city was 67 percent responsible for the
crash because of improper placement of a warning sign of an
upcoming curve on the West Side Highway. The panel found that
Robertson was 33 percent responsible because he exceeded the 40 mph
speed limit as he entered the curve.
   The accident broke Nowlin's back and left her paralyzed from the
waist down.
   Nowlin, now 31 and a Dallas lawyer, testified that Robertson was
traveling about 65 mph, but taxicab driver Charles Stone testified
that he witnessed the former shortstop's 1983 Buick Riviera swaying
and swerving at 80 mph.
   In the courtroom in her wheelchair, she said she was happy the
jury found in her favor.
   Lawyers for the city had suggested that Nowlin was negligent for
not telling Robertson to slow down.
   In testifying about the accident, Nowlin recalled: ``All of a
sudden I heard Andre scream. He pushed on the brakes real hard and
the car crashed to the left. Then it jerked to the right. We hit
the wall on the other side and my back just snapped.''
   The day of the crash, she said, was the last fun day she had.
   Robertson, 33, who left baseball in 1989, testified last week at
the trial. He now works in a steam generating plant in Orange,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake early today shook
Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Romania, killing one person,
injuring at least 15 people and damaging buildings, authorities
said.
   The Salonica Seismological Institute said the temblor measured
5.5 on the Richter scale and was centered in the village of
Goumenisa, about 35 miles northwest of the Aegean coastal city of
Salonica. The spokesman, Vasillis Papazachos, said the temblor was
followed by several smaller aftershocks.
   Pat Jorgenson of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
Calif., said the quake measured 6.1 on the Richter scale.
   It was also felt in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania, news
reports said.
   A police spokesman in the Greek town of Edessa, 20 miles west of
the epicenter, said a 60-year-old woman was killed there.
   ``She was crushed when a wall collapsed on her. The rest of the
house remained standing,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said 10 people were treated and released from Edessa
hospital, while two others remained hospitalized.
   Many houses in Edessa suffered minor damage, and two apartment
buildings were near collapse, said the spokesman.
   A police spokesman at regional headquarters in Salonica said
three people suffered slight injuries in Goumenisa and three houses
collapsed. He said telephone communications with the town were
disrupted.
   He said the temblor ``was felt throughout northern Greece and
lasted about 20 seconds. People here in Salonica were rushing out
of their buildings in panic.''
   The quake caused minor injuries and damaged houses in southern
Yugoslavia, the Tanjug news agency reported. The quake forced the
interruption of classes at schools in the southern Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia, Tanjug said.
   No injuries or damage were reported in Bulgaria and Romania.
   Northern Greece is a seismologically active region. An
earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale struck Salonica in
1978, killing 40 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage, while a 6
reading can cause severe damage in populated areas.

<TEXT>
   A rash of seven shotgun killings is scaring
people into carrying guns or staying indoors at night as police try
to nab the killer before another attack.
   Gun sales are skyrocketing in the largely blue-collar area of
northwest Indiana after the slayings within a 20-mile radius since
late October.
   At Jack's Gun Shop in Burns Harbor sales of firearms and
ammunition have jumped fivefold since last week, owner Jack Batz
said Thursday.
   ``We saw a big increase because people realize these are
senseless killings,'' Batz said.
   The latest victims were brothers Ilija ``Eli'' Balovski and
George Baloski, who were killed with shotgun blasts to the head in
their Gary tailor shop Tuesday. The store is just down the street
from a pawn shop where owner Robert Ribicki has armed himself.
   ``Life's too damn precious for this kind of junk,'' said
Ribicki, who carried a .38 Colt revolver strapped at his waist just
under his jacket. ``I just hope they catch this guy, I don't care
if they blow him away.''
   Police believe the killings were carried out by the same gunman.
They were looking for a man described as white and between 20 and
35 years old, Portage police Sgt. Warren E. Lewis said.
   ``We have evidence to tie all the shootings together. We have
several suspects at this time,'' Lewis said. ``I can't say that we
are close to an arrest.''
   He declined to discuss the evidence, but sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said shell casings from the latest killings
match those from earlier slayings. A special police unit was formed
to investigate the shootings that occurred in a parking lot, at gas
stations, a garage, a motel, a bank and on the street.
   Ribicki, who sells a variety of merchandise, including shotguns,
says all five people working there now carry guns.
   ``I've had customers come in and when they see my gun they say,
`You guys finally got smart,''' he said, adding that his gun sales
have tripled since the shootings began.
   Some people don't welcome the increase in people carrying guns.
   ``I can see some poor sucker getting his head blown off
approaching a car to ask for directions to Burger King,'' said
Willy Carbins, 40, who was waiting for his teen-age son to get off
work at a gas station less than a block from the site of the latest
shootings.
   The Gary Police Department also doubts the wisdom of fearful
citizens carrying guns.
   ``People are always going to panic a little when something like
this occurs,'' department spokesman William Burns said.
   In the hands of the inexperienced, guns lead to accidental
injuries or thefts that put more weapons in the hands of criminals,
he said.
   The shotgun killings began Oct. 30, when a man and a woman were
gunned down and at least three other people were fired at in
separate incidents in the nearby towns of Griffith, St. John and
Cedar Lake.
   Then there was a lull broken with the Dec. 13 death of a man
working at a gas station in Portage.
   That was followed by the slayings Saturday of a man and a woman
in separate attacks in Portage and Gary, and the shooting of an
Indiana Toll Road collector the same day.
   Some in this steel mill city on the southern shore of Lake
Michigan were blase about the string of killings.
   ``That's not uncommon. In Gary, people go around killing each
other for no reason,'' said local resident Denise Moss, 23.
   But as news and rumors about the attacks spread, people began to
take precautions.
   ``People are just nervous, just scared and people have a reason
to be,'' said Louis Ruffin, 44, who did electrical work for the
slain brothers.
   He said he won't go outside after 10 p.m. and rarely ventures
out alone after dark.
   ``I'm not afraid of nobody, but I know I can't do nothing with a
shotgun, except get killed,'' Ruffin said. ``This has put a damper
on a lot of Christmases.''

   The Postal Service was unable to convince
Saudi Arabia's national airline to waive international mail rates
in favor of the lower fees charged by U.S. carriers for carrying
mail to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf, a postal official said.
   James E. Orlando, head of international services for the Postal
Service, said Saudi Arabian Airlines charged nearly $1.9 million to
deliver about 1.05 million pounds of mail to Desert Shield troops
from Sept. 1 to Oct. 17.
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., sent a letter of protest to the
Saudi ambassador and the postmaster general, saying that was too
much to pay.
   Orlando said the charge was reasonable in that it complied with
the rates set by the Universal Postal nion, an international
organization of postal administrators.
   But he noted the Saudis had declined a Postal Service request
that the airline instead charge the rates set by the Department of
Transportation for U.S. carriers. The UPU rates are about 2 1/2
times higher than the U.S. rates.
   Gilman recommended that the Postal Service work with the Defense
and State departments ``to ensure that Saudi Airlines absorb these
mail expenses.'' The congressman is the ranking Republican on the
House Post Office and Civil Service Committee.
   Orlando said the question of whether the rates were fair given
that the U.S. troops are defending Saudi Arabia was ``a legitimate
issue for the Congress and the administration, but not for the
Postal Service.''

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis remained the eternal
optimist in an farewell address that expressed few regrets for a
volatile political career that has declined rapidly since his
failed bid for the presidency.
   Despite two years of political troubles since he won the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, Dukakis sounded upbeat
as he said goodbye.
   ``I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth,''
the governor said Thursday, repeating the phrase the ailing
baseball legend Lou Gehrig used to bid farewell to fans in Yankee
Stadium.
   Dukakis, 57, received a standing ovation from supporters and
administration officials in the Massachusetts House, where he
launched his political career. His wife, Kitty, his children and
his mother joined him in the packed chamber.
   The three-term governor was relaxed and unsentimental, taking
indirect swipes at President Bush.
   ``We should feel terrific. As a nation and as a people, we
should be leading, both at home and abroad,'' Dukakis said. ``But
we don't feel terrific, do we? On the contrary, we seem to be
having a collective political nervous breakdown in this country.''
   Repeating some of his campaign themes, Dukakis called for a
national health care program, and warned that something must be
done to pay off the national deficit.
   ``I made a lot of mistakes in the 1988 campaign, but few were as
bad as my failure to make the case for the kind of fundamental
change that we, as a nation, must seek,'' Dukakis said.
   The governor conceded that Massachusetts has had its share of
fiscal problems.
   ``That doesn't mean that we here in Massachusetts can smugly
point the finger at our brethren in Washington,'' Dukakis said.
``We've had more than our share of troubles over the past two
years.''
   The state has been plagued by financial woes since Dukakis
returned from the national campaign trail, and the governor's
administration has said that it will leave a deficit up to $100
million.
   But Dukakis said Massachusetts has tried to deal with its budget
deficit.
   ``We've made the cuts,'' he said. ``We've done what wasn't
popular. It hasn't been fun, and it hasn't been easy. But we've
done it - and so must the nation if we are to provide the kind of
leadership for the world and the kind of future for our people that
we want for ourselves and for all mankind.''
   Dukakis was first elected governor in 1975, but was defeated by
Edward J. King after his first term. He came back to defeat King in
1983, and won the Democratic nomination for president in 1988.
Shortly after losing the presidential race, Dukakis said he would
not run for governor again.
   He leaves office Jan. 3, and will be replaced by Gov.-elect
William Weld, the first Republican governor the state has had since
the early 1970s.
   While his long-range plans are unclear, in January he leaves for
Hawaii, where in the spring semester he will teach at the
University of Hawaii.

   The number of Soviet Jews immigrating to Israel
has nearly doubled in recent days, reflecting new fears of
political turmoil in the Soviet Union, officials said today.
   Israel is using every available plane to bring in Soviet
immigrants from European transit points and expects as many as
6,000 to arrive between Thursday and Sunday, the officials said.
   In the past three days, more than 1,500 Soviet Jews have landed
in Israel daily, compared to the previous daily average of about
800, said Gad Ben-Ari, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency, a
quasi-governmental group that handles immigration.
   ``No doubt the growing wave is in part a response to the
worsening situation in the Soviet Union and the debilitation of the
government,'' said Jewish Agency chairman Simcha Dinitz.
   Apprehensions grew after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze resigned Thursday and said in his farewell speech that
the Soviet Union was moving toward a dictatorship.
   Alexander Bronstein, 55, a chemistry professor from Moscow, said
many Soviet Jews feared the liberal emigration policies of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would soon end.
   ``The resignation of Shevardnadze is bad for Gorbachev, bad for
democracy and bad for U.S.-Soviet Union relations,'' Bronstein told
reporters at Ben Gurion International Airport today. ``It is
certainly possible that the gates may close.''
   Yurevich Gertsovich, 50, a librarian from Minsk, said she came
as soon as she could because she feared emigration would be halted.
   ``Nothing good has ever come out of waiting. The more you wait
the worse things become. So we got out, all of us,'' said Mrs.
Gertsovich, who arrived with 15 relatives.
   Dinitz said he hoped Shevardnadze's resignation would not affect
immigration. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said he did not
think there was reason for special concern.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu predicted that the
increased pace of Soviet immigration would continue because of the
political upheaval in the Soviet Union.
   ``If we planned for 500,000 Jews (arriving) next year, it is
quite possible that with a radical change in the situation in the
Soviet Union we will have to absorb twice as many in a short
time,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
   Already, the pace of immigration is causing problems in Israel,
including housing shortages and unemployment among the immigrants.
Officials are fearful the thousands arriving also will overwhelm
schools and social services.
   At least 160,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel in 1990.
They reach transit stations in Warsaw, Budapest and Bucharest by
air or overland. From the transit stations, Israeli planes, most of
them from the national carrier El Al, take them to Tel Aviv.
   El Al spokesman Nachman Kleinman said the airline has been
sending extra planes since midweek because of the great increase in
the number of Soviet Jews reaching the transit points.
   ``They are leaving with any means they can,'' Kleinman said.
   For security reasons, Israel tries to get immigrants out of the
transit stations and to Tel Aviv the same day.
   Transport Minister Moshe Katzav has issued a special permission
this week to allow El Al flights to land during the Jewish Sabbath,
which lasts from sundown today to sundown Saturday.
   El Al nornally doesn't operate during that period because Jewish
law forbids work on the sabbath.

<HEAD>Air Force Official Questions Safety Of C5-Bs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired Air Force official said cargo jets
used extensively in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia have
not been thoroughly inspected, a newspaper reported today.
   Retired Lt. Col. Lawrence B. Welborn told the Los Angeles Times
that the Air Force only looked at a fraction of the Lockheed C-5B
aircraft frames they later told Congress they tested for defects.
   A Lockheed spokesman said the plane does not have structural
flaws, but said he was unfamiliar with the details of the Air
Force's inspections.
   ``The tests previously performed by Lockheed and validated by
the Air Force metallurgists established the metallurgical soundness
of the C-5Bs,'' the spokesman said.
   Welborn said he was in charge of the inspections in 1986 at
Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma. In a sworn affidavit and in an
interview with the newspaper, Welborn said that only one area of
one C-5B's frame was exposed for testing on Dec. 6, 1986. Three
C-5Bs were supposed to be tested.
   The test, he said, only took a few hours. To fully test the
entire structure of the three planes would have taken several days,
he said.
   Welborn's affidavit - taken by Claremont, Calif., attorney
Herbert Hafif -was received by Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who
was on the oversight and investigations subcommittee that requested
the 1986 inspections.
   Dingell demanded Thursday that the Defense Department
investigate whether the Air Force misled Congress.
   Possible structural flaws were brought to the attention of
Congress in 1986 by three former Lockheed employees represented by
Hafif.
   Those employees claimed that because of a defective oven, the
jet's mainframes were overheated, causing cracks and voids in the
metal.
   After Congress' request for the inspection in 1986, Gen.
Lawrence Skantze, then the Air Force's procurement chief, reported
to the committee that the ``structural integrity of the 24
suspected forgings was confirmed.'' Diagrams of the test points
were presented to the committee.
   But on Thursday, Skantze said he had no firsthand knowledge of
the inspections but was assured at the time that the inspection had
been completed.
   ``Given the gravity of the issue, I am appalled that our people
would have assured me the job was done correctly, if indeed it was
not done,'' he told the Times.
   Last month, a Los Angeles jury awarded the employees a $45.3
million award in a civil case claiming they were fired after trying
to tell Lockheed management about the flaws. Lockheed has asked for
a new trial.

<HEAD>Twenty-One Soldiers Injured in Ethnic Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fistfight among ethnic groups in an army
battalion stationed in the Ukraine escalated into a gunbattle that
injured at least 21 soldiers, news reports said today.
   The fighting broke out Thursday among members of a railroad
battalion stationed in Chop, on the Ukrainian border with
Czechoslovakia, Tass said in a report based on a local newspaper
and the Ukrinform news agency.
   ``An inter-ethnic quarrel broke out among Armenian, Azerbaijani,
Chechenian, Uzbek and Turkmen soldiers, who began shooting at each
other,'' the report said.
   The official Tass news agency, quoting the Ukrainian newspaper
Robochaya Gazeta, said the fighting lasted several hours and that
21 soldiers were hospitalized ``with grave injuries,'' including
nine with gunshot wounds. It said several officers were also
wounded in the shootout.
   The independent news agency Interfax said at least 100 soldiers
were involved in the clash. It said most of the injuries occurred
when a guard unit accompanying an officer trying to break up the
fight opened fire.
   ``The men of the guard squad acted efficiently in night-time
conditions and shot only at the legs of attackers in order not to
kill them,'' Tass said.
   Interfax said the military procurator in the Ukraine has ordered

<HEAD>Cult Member Convicted on 5 Murder Counts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A religious cult member has been convicted
of murder for participating in the ritual killing of a five-member
family.
   A Lucas County Common Pleas Court jury found Ronald Luff, 30,
guilty Thursday of five counts of aggravated murder in the April
17, 1989, deaths of Dennis Avery; his wife, Cheryl; and their three
daughters.
   Each had been bound with duct tape and shot, then pushed into a
common grave inside a barn in Kirtland, about 30 miles east of
Cleveland, where the cult members lived. The Averys' bodies were
found in early January at the farm where Jeffrey Lundgren lived and
led the cult.
   The jury deliberated for 7{ hours before issuing its verdict.
   Defense lawyer J. Ross Haffey said he expected to appeal the
verdicts after a Jan. 7 hearing in which jurors decide whether Luff
should be put to death. Luff had pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity.
   Lundgren, a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has admitted to firing the shots
that killed the family. He said scriptures told him to kill the
family members because they were sinners. He has been sentenced to
death.
   Although Lundgren killed the Averys, Luff was a willing
participant, prosecutors said. Lundgren had told Luff and other
cult members that the Averys had to die before the cult could go on
a wilderness outing to see God.
   Luff has testified that he thought Lundgren was a prophet who
was going to lead his family to Zion, a place where man and God
could live in peace.
   Testimony indicated that Luff helped dig a pit and gather rocks
that would be thrown on top of the Averys' bodies to keep them from
rising in the barn's soft dirt.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environment's ruin may be serious
business, but who says you can't have a chuckle over global
warming?
   ``50 Simple Things You Can Do to Pave the Earth'' is a spoof of
the national best-seller ``50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the
Earth.''
   In it, comedian Darryl Henriques suggests that it's time we uit
being so glum and have fun with energy conservation.
   Duplicating the original book's format of nature-saving tips,
``Pave the Earth'' urges earth-minded people to save the gray water
left over from laundry, baths and dishes. ``You can sell graywater
to the Navy to pour around their ships to make them invisible,''
the book helpfully suggests.
   Under another heading, ``Pave the Earth'' says it's time
Americans replace lawns with artificial turf. ``If all the water
used on lawns was diverted to raising cattle, we could produce at
least 10 billion more steaks per year,'' the book says. ``Would you
rather mow the lawn or barbecue a steak?''
   The book finds a silver lining in the greenhouse effect: ``As
earth's atmosphere heats up, mangoes will soon be growing in
Minnesota. Cold climate residents will no longer have to travel to
the tropics.''
   At the book's conclusion, Henriques says his jokes shouldn't be
taken as insensitive. ``It has been demonstrated that humor can
have a positive impact on disease,'' he writes, ``and it is my
fervent hope that it can also help to heal the earth.''

<TEXT>
   Suez Canal authorities have stepped up
security against a possible Iraqi attempt to scuttle a vessel in
the waterway to block it, canal officials said today.
   The measures include assigning cement carriers to the rear of
canal convoys so that if they are sunk other vessels would not be
blocked. Once sunk, cement carriers are extremely difficult to
clear because of the wet cement.
   The canal is important for oil shipping as well as for the
United States and other countries massing warships in the Persian
Gulf region.
   Because the canal carries much of Western Europe's oil, an
extended blockage would hit that region's economy hard and could be
almost ruinous to Egypt's. The canal annually earns more than $1.5
billion in foreign exchange for Egypt.
   Canal security has been tighter since Egypt condemned Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and sent troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force deployed in the gulf region to defend against
further Iraqi advances.
   Intelligence sources in Cairo said today the new canal measures
were in line with a security upgrade ordered nationwide on
strategic installations like the canal, the Aswan High Dam in
southern Egypt and vital industries.
   Canal officials said authorities recently began careful checks
of the itineraries and ownership of cement-carrying ships,
particularly those coming from the Far East or the gulf region.
   Today, a Romanian ship carrying cement, the 38,000-ton Beius,
was the last of 30 ships to transit the 101-mile long canal. It
origin and destination were unclear.
   The canal officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Suez Canal Authority took the additional safeguard of
dispatching two tugboats to follow the Romanian ship through the
waterway.
   They said more Egyptian harbor workers and stevedores than usual
have been boarding all cement-carrying ships. Such workers provide
dockside and harbor services at the southern and northern ends of
the canal, Suez and Port Said.
   In addition, they report to Egyptian intelligence on anything
unusual found aboard ships.
   As a rule, Suez Canal Authority pilots steer ships through the
waterway.
   Despite its value to Egypt, President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1956
scuttled two ships carrying concrete and stones in the waterway to
block it. He aimed to hurt Western economies in reprisal for a
concerted military attack on Egypt by Britain, France and Israel.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened in August to punish
Arab states that sided with Kuwait in the crisis. Recently,
pro-Iraqi Palestinian hard-liner Mohammed Abbas extended the threat
to the United States and Kuwait's other Western allies.
   Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, leads the Baghdad-based
Palestine Liberation Front, which hijacked the Italian cruise liner
Achille Lauro in 1985 and killed a wheelchair-bound American
passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.

   New York's highest court has granted
workers' compensation benefits to a school bus driver who suffered
severe psychological problems after seeing the wreckage of a fatal
car crash.
   The state Court of Appeals awarded the benefits Thursday to Rose
Wood, who was driving a busload of kindergartners to school on
April 29, 1986, when she came upon a car accident in which two
teen-agers she knew were killed.
   In its 7-0 decision, the court said psychological pain brought
on by witnessing a tragedy can be considered an accidental injury
and can be subject to the same compensation as a physical injury.
   The court said, however, that compensation isn't necessarily due
all employees who suffer mental pain after seeing an injury to
someone else at work.
   ``What the court seems to be saying is that the closer you are
to being an active participant, the more likelihood you have of
winning the case,'' said Thomas Dunne, lawyer for the Workers'
Compensation Board.
   Wood, then 50, was the first person on the accident scene and
saw the mangled body of one of the victims, the court said. Wood
remained at the scene until emergency help arrived and then
continued on her route, the court said.
   Within weeks of the accident, Wood began suffering from
insomnia, nightmares, anorexia, depression and chest pains, the
court said. Less than two months after the accident, Wood was
involved in a near-collision between her school bus, again filled
with kindergarten children, and an automobile.
   Wood then was hospitalized and treated for stress, the court
said. Wood, of Coxsackie, about 25 miles south of Albany, couldn't
return to the job she'd held for 12 years. She has been out of work
since and remains under treatment, said her lawyer, Brendan Quinn.
   Wood then sought workers' compensation benefits from her
employer, Laidlaw Transit. An administrative law judge for New
York's Workers' Compensation Board rejected Wood's claim to
compensation for lost wages. But the full compensation board
overturned that decision and awarded benefits.
   The bus company took the case to the Appellate Division of state
Supreme Court, which dismissed the award. That court said that
while Wood's disability arose in the course of her job, she
technically was not involved in an accident.
   The Court of Appeals, however, said there was no question that
Wood's psychological and emotional problems were a direct result of
her job. Judge Judith Kaye said that Wood, as a school bus driver,
had job responsibilities that ``distinguished her from others who
might have passed on the road.''
   ``Rose Wood was by virtue of her employment an active
participant - more than a third party merely witnessing another's
injury,'' Kaye said. ``The feeling on (Wood's) part that she should
have been able to help, but couldn't, precipitated her
psychological injuries.''
   It's now up to the compensation board to determine how much Wood
can receive in benefits, Quinn said. If she's granted full
disability, she can be compensated at two-thirds of her salary for
the 4{ years since the accident - about $45,000, Quinn said.
   The lawyer for Laidlaw Transit, Leo Hacker, did not return
telephone calls to his office Thursday or early today.

<HEAD>Report Shows Vicki Long Got $20,000 in Church Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta said it won't
seek to recover more than $20,000 in church funds that went to a
woman whose affair with the nation's highest-ranking black Catholic
led to his resignation.
   An audit of the archdiocese and two parishes, conducted by a
public accounting firm, revealed Thursday that about $5,835 from
the individual churches went directly to Vicki Long or to her
creditors to pay her rent, utilities or charge cards.
   The archdiocese paid $14,556 in medical expenses for Ms. Long
through the summer of 1990, but the audit said no archdiocese funds
went directly to her.
   The archdiocese initiated the audit after the resignations last
summer of Archbishop Eugene Marino and the Rev. Michael Woods, a
Sandy Springs priest who said he had a sexual relationship with Ms.
Long.
   Ms. Long denied the relationship with Woods, but claimed she was
married to Marino and filed a paternity suit in 1987 against
another priest, the Rev. Donal Keohane of Columbus. A blood test
later showed Keohane did not father her daughter.
   Ms. Long said she was sexually exploited by Keohane and Marino,
and also claimed to have been molested by a nun in Columbus.
   Marino, once the nation's highest-ranking black Catholic, has
undergone therapy at an undisclosed location since his resignation.
   The audit report said money from two churches - St. Pius X
Parish in Conyers and St. John the Evangelist Parish in Hapeville -
went both to pay medical bills and directly to Ms. Long or her
creditors. The audits began with May 1986 records and went through
June 1989 for St. John and August 1990 for St. Pius X.
   The Rev. John Walsh of St. Pius told the archdiocese last fall
that he had paid Ms. Long with funds set aside for the poor. There
was no indication of a relationship between Walsh and Ms. Long.
   Woods was pastor at St. John the Evangelist, where Ms. Long was
a lay minister, for 10 years before moving to St. Jude's Parish in
Sandy Springs two years ago. A review of St. Jude's records showed
no money had gone to Ms. Long.
   An archdiocese spokesman, the Rev. Peter Dora, said the church
would not discipline Woods or Walsh for disbursing the money, nor
would it try to recover the funds from Ms. Long.
   But he said she will not receive any more money ``directly or
indirectly from the archdiocese of Atlanta or any of its
components.''
   The audit did not review the personal finances of Marino, who is
believed to have contributed more money to Ms. Long over a two-year
period.
   ``Archbishop Marino pretty well lost his life savings,'' Dora
said. ``Likewise, Father Woods is destitute.''
   Dora said the audit uncovered only one previously unrevealed
archdiocese expense for Ms. Long - $47 that he said was for flowers
sent to her during an illness.
   The financial review was published Thursday in the archdiocese
newspaper, the Georgia Bulletin. It was headed by Coca-Cola Co.
President Donald Keough and conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand public
accountants.

   Former Minnesota Gov. Karl Rolvaag, who

died Thursday at age 77.
   Rolvaag had been seriously ill for the last month with a heart
condition.
   Rolvaag was lieutenant governor for eight years before running
for governor in 1962. He won the election by 91 votes, but did not
take office until March 1963 because of a five-month recount. He
served as governor until 1967.
   President Lyndon Johnson appointed Rolvaag ambassador to Iceland
in 1967 after he lost his 1966 re-election bid for governor.

   Broadcast pioneer Karl O. Wyler, who began
singing on radio as a teen-ager and went on to own radio and
television stations in El Paso, has died at age 84.
   He died Thursday night, apparently from a heart attack,
officials said.
   Wyler first became involved in broadcasting in 1921, when he
conducted his four-piece orchestra, The Merrymakers, over ham radio
airwaves.
   He went on to own radio and television stations KTSM.
   In 1977 he was named Pioneer Broadcaster of the Year by the
Texas Association of Broadcasters.
   ``I looked up to him for years and years. He was one of the
great men in broadcasting,'' said Richard Pearson, general manager
of rival television station KVIA. ``This man built an empire of AM,
FM and television when nobody else believed in it. I had the
greatest respect for him.''
   Besides his broadcast business, Wyler was long active in El Paso
civic affairs.
   About 300 guests turned out April 5, his 84th birthday, when he
was honored by the El Paso Community Foundation for his
contributions to the city's children and the needy.
   Survivors include his wife, Glyn; and his son, Karl O. Wyler II.

<HEAD>Authorities Agree to Permit Weekend Opposition Rally</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today gave permission for
the first legal oppostion rally in Albania and said all statues and
symbols bearing the name of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin should be
removed.
   Authorities also said enterprises and institutions bearing
Stalin's name should receive new ones, the state ATA news agency
reported. It said this was decided ``taking into consideration that
historic circumstances have changed.''
   Workers on agricultural cooperatives and residents in housing
blocks named after Stalin should similarly decide on new names, the
report said.
   Clusters of Tirana residents watched all morning as workers
toiled to dismantle the marble-covered pedestal in a central park
on which a statue of Stalin had stood for decades. The statue
itself came down at midnight.
   A second Stalin statue at the Stalin Textile Combine in Tirana
was also taken down overnight.
   Stalin, who was born this day in 1879, was the father-figure of
the harsh brand of communism that Albania's founder Enver Hoxha
imposed on his country for 41 years.
   ``Now let's take down the statue of the dictator who ruled here
for 50 years,'' said one youth, referring to a giant bronze statue
of Hoxha that towers nearby over Tirana's showcase Skanderbeg
Square.
   Demonstrators in northern Shkodra last week reportedly blew up
that city's giant statu of Hoxha. Authorities there took down a
Stalin memorial in August. Flowers have been planted on the spot
where the statue of Hoxha once stood.
   In Shkodra, hundreds of windows smashed in the violence were
boarded over, and soldiers stood guard today around the vandalized
Communist Party headquarters.
   The decisions to permit a rally Saturday by the new opposition
Democratic Party and to remove Stalin statues indicated pro-reform
forces were gaining the upper hand in the ruling Albanian Labor -
or Communist - Party.
   The rally would be the first officially sanctioned protest not
sponsored by the Communists, who for decades suppressed any
opposition. Several thousand students rallied in Tirana last week
to demand democratic change and hail the founding of the first
non-Communist party and police did not itervene.
   Sali Berisha, a founder of the Democratic Party, said Saturday's
rally would press opposition demands for the release of all
political prisoners, as well as for the postponement of free
elctions scheduled for February.
   The Democratic Party says it does not have time to organize by
polling day, set for Feb. 10, and wants the elections delayed until
April or May.
   To date, the Communists have used their power over official
media to keep public silence about the new party, meaning it must
rely on word of mouth to propogate its cause in a backward nation
with poor communications.
   On Thursday, there was another indication of the swift change
under way in Europe's last Stalinist state.
   Hoxha's 71-year-old widow Nexhmije lost her last political post,
quitting her chairmanship of the Communist-led Democratic Front for
what were termed reasons of age.
   She was replaced by Premier Adil Carcani, touching off
speculation that he might resign as head of government. The ruling
Communist Party promised a government reorganization when
protesting students forced democratic reforms earlier this month,
but so far no changes have been announced.
   The Communists' policies, however, remain secretive and opaque,
and they also have indicated they are prepared to use tough tactics
to maintain power.
   Demonstrators arrested after last week's violent riots in four
cities, including Shkodra, have received tough jail sentences of up
to 20 years.
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. today, a
Justice Ministry official denied Democratic Party allegations that
the accused were not receiving adequate defense from lawyers.
   The concept of rule by law is new to Albania, which only decided
earlier this year to reconstitute the Justice Ministry abolished
under Hoxha.

<TEXT>
   Four leading Western economic institutions
said today that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev must accelerate
the pace of reform in his country or run the risk that the effort
could fail.
   The long-awaited study, the most comprehensive look yet by the
West at the crumbling Soviet economy, called for economic pain in
the form of wage controls imposed on workers at the same time price
controls are removed from a variety of goods.
   It said such bitter medicine was the only way to stabilize the
chaotic situation in the Soviet Union, where consumers in major
cities are faced with massive shortages of food and other essential
products.
   ``The authorities face an enormous task, involving reforms of
the legal, financial and trade systems and also of vital sectors of
the economy, especially agriculture, distribution, energy and
manufacturing,'' said the report. It was prepared by the
International Monetary Fund with help from three other
organizations.
   ``These changes cannot be made in a matter of weeks,'' the study
concluded. ``But the imperative is to make sufficient progress at
the beginning so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with
the past and the process gains an unstoppable momentum.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Western experts conceded that the plan they were putting
forward could not be implemented without economic pain, but said
they knew of no other way to transform the Soviet system.
   ``Ideally, a path of gradual reform could be laid out which
would minimize economic disturbance and lead to an early harvesting
of the fruits of increased economic efficiency,'' the study said.
``But we know of no such path, the more particularly given the
difficult starting conditions.''
   But the study said that Gorbachev had passed the point of no
return in his efforts, saying it would probably be impossible to
reinstitute a centrally planned economy even if he wanted to.
   Therefore, the experts urged the Soviet leaders ``to move
rapidly to give substance to their commitment to a market
economy.''
   While calling for technical assistance to help the Soviets in
their efforts to discard seven decades of a planned economy, the
study said that massive amounts of Western aid would not be useful
right now.
   It said that without the implementation of a major and
far-reaching reform program, direct Western aid would be ``of
little or no lasting value.''
   The 50-page report represented a victory for the Bush
administration, which has argued for months that massive amounts of
Western aid would be wasted until Gorbachev made more extensive
moves to reform his economy.
   However, it cited certain specific areas where Western technical
expertise and investment could be of value.
   ``Immediate new investment could have a quick payoff for the
USSR and the rest of the world'' in the energy and environment
sectors, the report said.
   It cited modernization of nuclear plants, improvement of oil
drilling technologies and updating the Soviets' gas pipeline
systems as projects where foreign investment would be most useful
in the short term.
   Foreign assistance also could be ``particularly useful'' in
retailing and distribution, two areas that will be critical in the
transition to a market economy, the report said.
   The United States and other countries already have dispatched
experts to help the Soviets remove the bottlenecks in their
crumbling distribution system.
   In addition to the IMF, other groups participating in the study
were the World Bank and two European-based economic agencies, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   President Bush met with IMF Director Michel Camdessus and World
Bank President Barber Conable on Thursday to discuss the report,
which was ordered up by Bush and other leaders at the seven-nation
economic summit last July in Houston.
   The study represented a compromise last summer between demands
by the French and Germans for an immediate $15 billion Western aid
package and resistance to direct economic aid by Bush and the other
summit leaders.
   Today's report, however, indicated that no large sums of public
money were called for in the current period. Instead, it said, ``A
large part of this technical assistance should be provided by the
private sectors of Western countries with the role of public
sectors being limited to filling any important gaps.''
   Due to the breakdown of the distribution system, food shortages
are appearing in Moscow, Leningrad and other major Soviet cities,
particularly those farthest from agricultural regions. Germany and
a number of other European countries have embarked on food relief
programs for the Soviet Union.
   The United States has offered the Soviets $1 billion in bank
guarantees to help them buy U.S. grain and is coordinating a
program to encourage the private sector to supply medical supplies
and drugs to relieve shortages.
   ``Food aid, if targeted and successfully delivered to the
regions most affected, could alleviate present distress,'' the
study said. But it added, ``an early implementation of economic
reform would make the single largest contribution to alleviation of
shortages.''
   The report, which took five months to prepare, portrayed a
system that was even more backward than expected and practically
paralyzed in its stumbling efforts to implement Gorbachev's
restructuring program.
   Inflation is accelerating at a pace that is difficult to
measure, with the old centralized order being replaced by a chaotic
system of bartering and black marketeering, it said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
did not believe the surprise resignation Thursday of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze would derail the efforts to get
Western technical assistance to the Soviet economy.
   He said the United States would discuss the report with other
summit countries - Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada - in order to coordinate efforts. Finance ministers and
central bank presidents of the seven nations are expected to meet
in Washington in late January.
   In addition to the $1 billion in food credits, the
administration also announced last week that it supports a move to
make the Soviet Union a ``special associate'' of the IMF and the
World Bank. That would qualify the country for technical help but
no direct loans from the two lending organizations.

   A woman was arrested for giving her
2-year-old daughter cocaine on at least two occasions.
   Police said they found Maryland Brown's daughter under the
influence of cocaine Wednesday when they showed up at Brown's home
to arrest her for allegedly giving it to the girl before.
   Brown, 22, was charged with two counts of first-degree reckless
endangering and two counts of delivering cocaine.
   The girl was hospitalized, but officials declined to give her
name or condition.
   The investigation had begun last week when the girl was treated
at a hospital for cocaine withdrawal, police Sgt. Martin P. Hageman
said.
   Ivory L. Johnson, director of the state Division of Child
Protective Services, said he child was released from the hospital
into a relative's custody while police investigated her mother.
   ``Detectives obtained enough evidence to arrest her and upon
returning to the suspect's home, discovered the child had been
returned to the mother,'' Hageman said.
   Brown was held at the Women's Correctional Institution in
Claymont in lieu of $44,000 bail.

   Authorities arrested an 82-year-old
woman for investigation of drug trafficking after sheriff's
deputies found a half-gram of cocaine and drug paraphernalia in her
home, officials said.
   Juanita Jackson was arrested Thursday for investigation of
possession of cocaine for sale and maintaining a place for drug
trafficking, Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. Patrick McManus said.
   She was released today on her own recognizance from the
Riverside County jail, according to a county jail clerk who
declined to give her name.
   Another woman, Lisa Marie Soltz, 28, was arrested at the same
time for a parole violation.
   Lake Elsinore is 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

   Eight American soldiers have been
poisoned by home-brewed alcohol and hospitalized since Sunday, one
in very serious condition, the U.S. military command said.
   The soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are the first
known casualties of home-brewed liquor since U.S. forces were
deployed in Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country which bans all alcohol.
   Today's statement from the U.S. Central Command said the
soldiers, who were not identified, suffered from methanol
poisoning, which is a problem associated with faulty home-brewed
alcoholic beverages.
   Methanol poisoning, which can lead to blindness or death, was a
serious problem during Prohibition in the 1920s.
   The eight soldiers from the 372nd Transportation Company, 29th
Transportation Battalion, 101st Combat Support Group, are all
recovering, the command said.
   Army officials are investigating the incident.
   Since U.S. troops arrived in Saudi Arabia in early August, a
small number have been disciplined for having alcoholic beverages.
   Even though alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia, it is available
on the black market, and beer, wine and hard liquor are brewed at
home by some expatriates working in the kingdom.

   A salvage crew dragged the bottom of the
Allegheny River today in search of a sunken barge that paralyzed
part of the nation's busiest inland port for a third day.
   A four-mile stretch of the rain-swollen river was closed
Wednesday and Thursday from Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh
northeast to the Highland Park Bridge, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Rhea
Giacoma said.
   ``One little barge like this is more of a nuisance than anything
else,'' said John Reed, spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. ``But if you don't know where it is, it could create a
much bigger problem.
   ``Someone comes tooling along and hits that barge and then
you've got a few more of them sunk.''
   A tugboat crew used a 15-foot pole to probe the river for the
barge, but the search was suspended Thursday afternoon because it
was inadequate to search the river that has swollen to 40 feet deep
with recent rains. The Coast Guard asked the barge's owner, Azcon
Scrap Corp., to resume the search today with better equipment.
   Ms. Giacoma said the salvage crew today is using a bucket able
to reach the river bottom, ``and there's a diver on board who'll go
down if they hit anything.''
   The barge's owner, Azcon Scrap Corp., was paying for the search.
   The barge broke loose from its moorings at Azcon's scrap yard
last Friday and floated about 400 yards downstream. Two barge
workers jumped to safety before the steel barge sailed over a dam,
got stuck in the river mud and bent at a 45-degree angle.
   Ms. Giacoma said the barge broke free from the dam Tuesday
during more than 2 inches of rain, and sank somewhere.
   Most barges that ply the Allegheny River remained at their
moorings Thursday and there was little activity at U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers locks at Pittsburgh, Oakmont, Natrona Heights and
Freeport, corps civil engineer Dave Turcsanyi said.
   The locks transport an average of 5,500 tons of coal, steel,
sand, gravel, petroleum and other goods each day, Reed said.
   If the barge isn't found today, companies that depend on the
Allegheny River to ship their goods will begin to feel the pinch as
customers such as electric utilities switch to other suppliers,
Reed said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas implored Cambodia's
Supreme National Council today to accept a United Nations peace
proposal and said that time is running out to find a solution to
the conflict.
   Opening a meeting of the 12-member council, Dumas said the
proposal, adopted Nov. 26 by the five permanent U.N. Security
Council members, was a compromise text. ``It can be improved, but
it cannot be put into question,'' he said. ``We are proud of it.''
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen fainted during the meeting and
was rushed to hospital. Dumas said later he was in satisfactory
condition, apparently suffering from fatigue. It was not known how
long Hun Sen would remain at the Val de Grace military hospital.
   The Cambodians were meeting with France and Indonesia, which
co-chair the International Conference for Peace in Cambodia, the
framework for signing a peace accord. A U.N. representative was
also present at the meeting.
   Dumas tried to counter criticism that the Security Council plan
would give the United Nations too great a role in running the
country.
   The plan calls for the United Nations to administer Cambodia
during an interim period before free elections, and for the Supreme
National Council to act as titular head.
   Hun Sen has already said the plan gives the United Nations,
which would head key ministries, too much power.
   While acknowledging the U.N. representative would have ``strong
powers,'' Dumas stressed that ``it is in no case a real tutelage as
long as the Supreme National Council embodies the sovereignty of
Cambodia.''
   He said, however, that unresolved quarrels among the four
Cambodian factions made it ``indispensible'' to give the U.N.
representative final decision-making power to avoid paralysis.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas presided over the meeting
with Dumas. Representing the three Cambodian factions were
Communist Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan, the non-Communist
leader of the Khmer People's National Front, Son Sann, and Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, son of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   If the four Cambodian parties accept the proposal, the Paris
conference would be reconvened to sign a final peace accord.
   But French officials have expressed skepticism that today's
meeting, expected to last one day, could win consent of the rival
factions.
   The Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government, which has six of the
council's 12 seats, has already objected to key aspects of the
accord, including the designation of the United Nations as
administrator of Cambodia. The proposal was adopted by the United
States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China and France.
   At its only other meeting in September in Bangkok, the council
broke up in a dispute over its composition.
   Hun Sen objected to efforts by Sihanouk to be president of the
council, saying that would alter the balance in favor of the
resistance.
   Dumas said time is running out. ``The international community
cannot indefinitely work out the fate of Cambodia if Cambodians
themselves do not have the political will to do so,'' he said.

   Three indigent people have sued Los Angeles
County, saying the county's relief payments are insufficient to
ward off hunger and homelessness.
   The lawsuit against the county Board of Supervisors claims that
the maximum payment of $312 a month, established after another
lawsuit, is grossly inadequate to feed, clothe and shelter the
indigent.
   The allotment allows $200 a month for housing, $95 for food, and
$17 for transportation, personal needs and clothing, according to
the lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
   The suit asks that the board be ordered to ``immediately raise
the monthly grant amounts by amounts sufficient to enable indigent
recipients to meet their basic subsistence needs.''
   It does not specify how much money that is.
   ``The general relief program is the final safety net for aid and
assistance to many destitute people,'' said the plaintiffs' lawyer,
John Brinsley. ``This monthly allocation has not been increased
since mid-1988 and is significantly below the federal poverty
line.''
   The county continues to be ``the provider of last resort,'' said
Deputy County Counsel Patrick Wu. Wu said he had not seen the
lawsuit and could not comment further on it.
   Brinsley said the supervisors ignored an increase recommended by
their own elfare director and chief administrative officer, voting
to keep payments the same.
   Those representing the plaintiffs in the class-action suit
include the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Inner City Law
Center and Western Center on Law and Poverty Inc.
   Three relief recipients - Elizabeth Mendly, Rudy Johnson and
John Butts Jr. - are named as plaintiffs. But the suit specifies
that ``plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all
those similarly situated.''
   Some 50,000 poor people receive relief payments each year in Los
Angeles County, according to the suit.

   Police today blamed group rivalry among
teen-agers for the shooting of four adolescents and a 6-year-old
who were wounded on their way home from school by gunshots from a
passing car.
   A 16-year-old and two 14-year-olds were arrested today in
connection with Thursday's shootings. Police said they were looking
for two other teen-agers as well.
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood blamed easy access to firearms and a
breakdown in values for the shooting. ``I don't know whether it was
drug-related or not, but I doubt it,'' he said. ``Don't make
everything drug-related; it cheapens the violence.''
   Fulwood declined to say what the altercation was about, but said
it was the kind of argument that at one time would have been
settled by a fist fight. The availability of firearms has given
young people other options, he said.
   The altercation, he said, occurred 1-1/2 to 2 weeks ago and
police were alerted that there might be trouble on Thursday.
   ``We did get a call earlier in the day and we took some steps,''
Fulwood said, adding that policemen were sent to the area.
   Lt. Reginald Smith, a police spokesman, said police had been
dispatched to the junior high school attended by the four victims
when they ``heard something was going down.''
   The injured youngsters, the oldest of whom was 15, were in a
group of children standing near a picket fence in a residential
area of northwest Washington when the drive-by shooting occurred,
police said.
   Their conditions this morning ranged from fair to serious. All
were expected to survive.
   Residents of the city were shocked by the shootings despite the
skyrocketing violence Washington has experienced in recent years.
Most of the 471 homicides this year have been at night and related
to drugs and family violence.
   The city has never had a serious problem with gang warfare or
daylight killings.
   ``When it comes to innocent babies, it's going too far,'' said
one woman who rushed to the scene from work after her daughter
called and described the incident.
   John Olden, 13, Clarence Richmond, 14, and Brian Lewis, 12, were
admitted to Children's National Medical Center in critical
condition, hospital spokeswoman Barbara Cire said, but their
conditions were upgraded to serious.
   Troy Gray, 15, and Xaziver Paul, 6, were admitted in serious
condition, but later were listed in fair condition.
   ``I ran up and saw them there, and they were all shot,'' said a
sixth grader who was nearby when the shootings occurred. ``They
leaned against the cars and checked to see where they had been
hit.''
   Two children were shot in the chest, two were shot in the
abdomen and one was shot in the arm, said Dr. Marty Eichelberger,
director of emergency trauma services at the hospital.
   ``There are five kids, and there are a lot of holes,''
Eichelberger said. ``When they all came in, it was a challenge to
even learn which of the youngsters were in the most serious
condition.''
   He said the two younger children's injuries were more
superficial than those sustained by the others.
   Witnesses said the children either collapsed after being shot or
staggered toward cars.
   Officials said the four older youngsters attended a junior high
school near the site of the shooting.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told
U.S. troops today it is increasingly likely war will be needed to
oust Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait, and that ``absolute, total
victory'' is the only option if war breaks out.
   ``It increasingly looks like he's not getting the message and
we'll have to use force,'' Cheney said in a pep talk to troops in
the northeast Saudi desert.
   ``The only acceptable outcome, if hostilities begin, is
absolute, total victory,'' Cheney continued.
   Gen. Colin Powell, who was visiting the troops with Cheney, said
he still hoped for a peaceful resolution of the Persian Gulf
crisis. But he drew roars of applause when he vowed:
   ``When we launch it, we will launch it violently, we will launch
it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get it over as
quickly as possible and there's no question who won.''
   Cheney and Powell, fresh from three days of strategy sessions
with field commanders in Saudi Arabia, were somewhat evasive when
asked by troops whether American ground forces would be ready to
fight by the Jan. 15 deadline for Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Those questions were raised this week by the deputy commander of
Operation Desert Shield, who said Wednesday still-arriving ground
troops might not be combat ready until well into February.
   Asked by an airman how long the United States would wait to
attack if the deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, Cheney
said:
   ``While I can't tell you a specific date, for obvious reasons,
when that would happen, I can say that we are eager to get this
wrapped up as quickly as possible.''
   Cheney added that U.S. military officials do not think ``waiting
indefinitely is going to solve the problem.''
   This week, military analysts said that if United States attacks
Iraq, the assault could begin with a massive air strike - followed
by a short pause to give Saddam a chance to surrender.
   That scenario gained credence Wednesday when U.S. military
officials conceded that some vital American ground forces might not
be ready by the Jan. 15 deadline.
   The likelihood of starting with air strikes has been discussed
for some time by military officials and others who believe the
United States - because of its long-term political interests in the
region - must keep damage to Iraq to a minimum.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there was considerable talk
that a U.S. attack would start with massive air strikes. But Bush
administration officials later told Congress that any U.S. assault
would include a massive air, land and sea campaign.
   Powell said this week, ``We're looking at an air, land and sea
campaign. But ... it doesn't mean we're going to do it all at
once.''
   A pause after an initial air strike makes sense for several
reasons, according to military and private analysts, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   First, it would save thousands of lives and damage on both sides
if Saddam decided he could not win a war and surrendered after an
air assault, averting a bloody ground war, these analysts say.
   ``We're going to have a country called Iraq in the region when
this is over no matter how it ends,'' one senior Army official
said. ``Doesn't it make sense that we would not want to totally
destroy their country, which in effect would totally destroy any
chances of relations with the government?''
   Also, since more than half of the 510,000 Iraqi troops are in
southern Iraq and Kuwait, a protracted war likely would leave much
of Kuwait in ruins.
   ``We could very well end up destroying the country we're there
to save,'' the Army official said.
   Those who predict the air strike scenario if war erupts got
unexpected support Wednesday from the deputy commander of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller said ground forces that are still
arriving in the gulf area to join the 280,000 already here might
not be combat-ready until well into February.
   The Pentagon reacted Thursday to Waller's comments about
readiness by saying U.S. air power in the region would be ready by
Jan. 15.
   A senior Pentagon official who often discourages speculating
about possible combat scenarios even reminded reporters that
military leaders have raised the possibility of opening any
hostilities with a phase of air attacks.
   Waller, however, said his advice would be to delay any
hostilities until all U.S. forces were ready.
   The commander of the Army component of the American deployment,
Lt. Gen. John Yeosock, said Thursday he envisioned a war with Iraq
``to be the highest, (operational) tempo battle ever recorded.''
   But he also said any combat plan was subject to continuous
change. That philosophy would leave room for endorsing a powerful
air strike followed by a pause - provided Bush was ready to follow
up with an all-out campaign if Saddam did not give in.
   ``Clearly, my intention is not to have a protracted war,''
Yeosock said.

<HEAD>Accused Cocaine Kingpin Threatens To Wage War On Drug Agents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive cocaine kingpin named in a
131-count indictment has threatened to make ``war'' against federal
agents pursuing his organization, according to a warning issued to
agents by U.S. Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration
officials.
   A teletype distributed to the federal agencies quotes accused
cocaine kingpin Juan Garcia-Abrego of saying: ``If they (drug
agents) want war, we'll give them war.''
   Federal agents learned of the alleged threat from the man, who
is believed to be in hiding in Mexico, through a ``previously used
and highly reliable'' informant, the San Antonio Light reported
today.
   The informant reported the ``war'' threat to Customs agents in
Brownsville on Monday.
   ``This threat, intended to suggest physical harm will be made
against any federal law enforcement official going into Northern
Tamaulipas, Mexico, was made because of the recent indictments that
have been issued against the heads of this major criminal
organization,'' the teletype says.
   ``The (Brownsville) source believes the threat is real and
constitutes a serious concern to any federal enforcement officer.''
   Garcia-Abrego, 46, is accused of being the head of a formidable
narcotics ring thought to be responsible for the state's largest
cocaine seizure, a nine-ton cache found last year in a Harlingen
safe house.
   The indictment against him was unsealed Dec. 12 in Dallas.
   Armando Ramirez, resident agent-in-charge of the Brownsville DEA
office, said Garcia-Abrego's threat would not hamper efforts to
arrest him or seize his property.
   ``This guy is going to have to stand on his mother's shoulders
in order to intimidate us,'' Ramirez said. ``He knows where our
office is, and if he has any problems he can come to us.''
   Garcia-Abrego and his top lieutenants face life in prison if
arrested and convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise
and drug conspiracy.

   When physician Howard Sauder asked his
staff for a sports car for Christmas, he didn't expect to arrive at
his office party to find his Nissan 280Z neatly wrapped outside.
   Too bad it was a 1982 model.
   Too bad it came straight from the junkyard.
   ``I know that's what I asked for, but I never thought they would
go to this,'' Sauder said. ``They're a pretty nutty crew.''
   Office Manager Janet Briggs said the staff first considered a
Matchbox car, especially when Sauder suggested they find second
jobs to buy his present.
   Workers at the Middle Creek Garage joined in the joke, offering
the car at no cost and even a free tow to the party Thursday.
   The tow truck was used again, when Sauder politely declined the
gift.
   ``Maybe next year I'll ask for an airplane,'' he said.

   A mysterious benefactor known as the Cadillac
Santa handed out $11,000 to a Skid Row throng.
   ``It was like the Israelites crossing the Red Sea,'' said Clancy
Imislund, director of the Midnight Mission at Fourth and Los
Angeles Streets.
   The annual visit of the philanthropist Thursday drew more than a
thousand poor people to the corner. The self-styled Santa, who
always drives up in a new Cadillac, handed out money for a
half-hour with the help of several assistants.
   ``He gave about $11,000 in brand new $10 bills,'' Imislund said.
``He went through all of his dough and there were people still
coming from Skid Row.''
   Imislund said the man will not divulge his name.
   The mission director said the visit provides excitement for
people not used to such generosity.
   ``It isn't the $10,'' Imislund said. ``It's the `Santa's coming'
feeling.''

   The dispute over whether a Nativity
scene should remain in front of City Hall this holiday season may
be moot by the time a judge gets around to hearing arguments - one
day after Christmas.
   A federal judge in San Jose has agreed to hear arguments Dec. 26
to decide whether the wood-carved manger scene implies governmental
endorsement of Christianity over other faiths.
   In similar cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed Nativity
scenes or other religious displays when they were surrounded by
other secular holiday decorations.
   The Monterey display, depicting the birth of Jesus, had been a
traditional holiday decoration outside City Hall for nearly 30
years until 1989 when it was moved to a Roman Catholic church to
avoid a legal dispute.
   But this year the Nativity scene went back up outside City Hall,
prompting the American Civil Liberties Union and Victor Ringel, a
13-year-old Jewish boy, to sue.

   Police said Friday they are investigating an
incident in which an explosive was found in a package delivered to
the offices of The Sun, a London-based tabloid.
   The explosive was mailed to the headquarters of Rupert Murdoch's
News International organization, publishers of The Sun, News of the

said a Scotland Yard spokesman.
   The Sun offices were evacuated until bomb disposal experts had

   The package contained an eight ounce stick of gelignite but had
no means of detonation, he said.
   Jane Reed, News International's director of corporate affairs,
said the package had been mailed from Australia.
   ``The package apparently slipped through the national post
office and local security checks and was finally discovered by one
of The Sun's secretaries,'' she said.
   She said the letter enclosed with the explosives referred to
somebody in north London who had links to Australia.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake shook the Balkans
early Friday, killing a Greek woman, causing homes to collapse and
injuring at least 40 people, authorities and news reports said.
   The Salonica Seismological Institute said the temblor measured
5.5 on the Richter scale. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
Calif., said it recorded the quake at 6.1.
   Its epicenter was in the village of Goumenisa, about 35 miles
northwest of Salonica, the seismological institute said. The quake
was also felt in Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria, according to
news reports.
   A spokesman at the Salonica institute said more than 30
aftershocks followed the main quake, the largest measuring 3.5 on
the open-ended Richter scale.
   The quake occurred in the Serbo-Macedonian zone, which begins in
southern Bulgaria and winds into northern Greece, a seismologically
active region. The zone includes the Cressna fault.
   A police spokesman in the town of Edessa, about 20 miles west of
the epicenter, identified the dead woman as 69-year-old Anastasia
Deltsou.
   ``She was crushed when a wall collapsed on her,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The main regional hospital in Edessa reported that more than 25
people were treated for injuries and five of them were
hospitalized.
   A hospital spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
area medical centers treated and released at least 15 other people.
   According to police reports, 11 houses in towns and villages
near the epicenter either collapsed or became uninhabitable. Three
fell down in Goumenisa.
   The quake also caused minor injuries and damaged houses in the
southern Yugoslavia republic of Macedonia, on the border with
Greece, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   There were no reports of damage or injuries in Romania and
Bulgaria.
   A spokesman at the Salonica institute said the temblor ``seems
to have been the main quake, although we are gathering data to make
sure it was not a foreshock.''
   An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale struck Salonica
in 1978, killing 40 people. A temblor measuring 5.8 on the Richter
scale preceded it by less than a month.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 5.0 can cause considerable damage,
and one measuring 6.0 can cause severe damage in populated areas.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's chief archaeologist
and chairman of antiquities, has died of a heart attack at age 54,
friends and newspapers reported Friday.
   Tawfik, a former dean of archaeology and professor of Egyptology
at Cairo University, was the author of a half-dozen books on
Egyptian antiquities.
   As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, he was in
charge of all restoration and conservation work on Egypt's vast
legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by
time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.
   But among Egyptologists, Tawfik is remembered most as an
excavator, especially for his work on a windblown bluff overlooking
the ancient royal burial grounds of Sakkara south of Cairo.
   He began the excavation eight years ago. In 1985 he uncovered an
unknown burial ground from the time of Pharaoh Ramses II, tombs
hidden 33 feet below the desolate hillside that yielded a rich
store of data about some of the most important officials of the
Egypt of 3,250 years ago.
   Friends said Tawfik was at Sakkara on Thursday. That night he
suffered a heart attack and died instantly.He was buried on Friday.
   Tawfik spoke of his love for Egyptology and excavation in an
interview on Tuesday, his last.
   ``Each time I excavate, I'm rewriting history,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``Imagine that before I began the dig in Sakkara,
we never knew Ramses II had a history there. History is a puzzle,
and I'm helping to write new chapters.''
   Tawfik became chairman of antiquities in December 1988 after a
10-month battle over who or what caused a boulder to fall from the
shoulder of the Sphinx, which cost Tawfik's predecessor his job.
   Widespread concern persists over the future of the half-man,
half-beast statue at the foot of Giza Plateau.
   But Tawfik remained optimistic to the end that the Sphinx would
survive. He made weekly visits, including one Tuesday morning.
   ``I think the restoration work going on at the Sphinx is
wonderful. I'm so happy with it,'' he said.
   ``Some weeks I go once to the Sphinx, sometimes three times. If
I don't go to make sure everything is going well, the Sphinx might
sleep. And one day I'll go and it'll be gone. I must be vigilant,
fight to save the Sphinx.''
   Despite his workload, Tawfik refused to abandon his love for
excavation.
   ``Excavation is life, and what's so wonderful is each time you
go down, you are a discoverer,'' he said Tuesday.
   Survivors include Tawfik's German-born widow, Frieda; his son
Tarek, an Egyptology student at Cairo University; and daughter,
Sophie, a pupil at a German school in Cairo.

<HEAD>Lithuania Protests Army Patrols in Port City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian Supreme Council said today it has
sent a note to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev protesting Soviet
army patrols in the port city of Klaipeda and demanding the
soldiers be removed.
   The Klaipeda garrison commander notified Lithuanian authorities
on Wednesday that armed units would begin patrolling the streets
and have the authority to check people's documents, the Tass agency
said.
   ``This order is a flagrant violation of the laws and the rights
of citizens of the republic of Lithuania, as well as a political
provocation with the intent to heighten tensions and to create
ptential conflicts,'' said a copy of the note made available to
Western news agencies.
   The patrols were ordered in response to clashes between
civilians and Soviet soldiers and sailors in Klaipeda, a Baltic
seaport with a large military presence, according to an editor of
the Elta news agency.
   They have the authority to check identity documents of both
soldiers and civilians, and arrest those who resist.
   Lithuania - which along with the other Baltic republics of
Estonia and Latvia has declared independence - said the orders
issued by the Soviet military were not valid on the territory of
the republic.
   The note called on Gorbachev to ``revoke the mentioned
directives of the Soviet army authorities and to punish them for
their willful behavior which is accompanied by the threat of armed
violence.''
   The Supreme Council also released a statement calling on
Lithuanians to remain calm and not to get involved in conflicts
with the patrols.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Says Jan. 15 is Not `Attack Day' for Iraq</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Scowcroft comments on Jan.
15 deadline; editing. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said today that the
Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait ``is not an
attack day'' for American forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Instead, said Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to
President Bush, ``What it tells Saddam Hussein is that after the
15th - he'd better get moving now - after the 15th of January, he
is at risk.
   ``It doesn't say he is going to be attacked this date or that
date or whatever,'' Scowcroft said. ``What it says is, he is at
risk of the mandate of the Security Council after the 15th of
January.''
   Scowcroft's comments came a day after Bush warned that Iraq
would be trounced in any war with the United States.
   ``If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass
kicked,'' Bush was quoted as telling lawmakers Thursday.
   Jan. 15 is the date set in a United Nations Security Council
resolution authorizing all means necessary to expel Iraq from
Kuwait if it hasn't withdrawn voluntarily. Bush said earlier this
week that the U.N. mandate must be implemented on schedule.
   Scowcroft made his comments in an interview with The Associated
Press and reporters from other news agencies. He said he was not
trying to raise or dampen expectations of military action on Jan.
15.
   ``All I'm saying is the 15th is an authorization date. That's
the way to describe it. What I'm saying is the 15th doesn't mean
the troops and aircraft start to move on the 15th,'' Scowcroft
said.
   On Thursday, Bush told lawmakers that Saddam does not understand
the military threat he faces.
   However, some congressional leaders expressed concern about the
fallout from fighting.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, just back from the
Middle East, said he and members of his group detected
``considerable support among the masses'' in Arab countries for
Saddam.
   ``And that is a reality with which we must deal, even though the
governments of some of those countries are allied with us at this
time,'' the Maine Democrat said.
   Furthermore, he said, he told the president that allies in the
region - particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia - were fearful of a
broader conflict that would bring Israel into the battle, thereby
complicating the scenario with Arabs pitted against Israelis.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said it was an open question whether
soldiers from Arab countries would fight those from another.
   Bush met with two delegations of lawmakers who visited the
Persian Gulf.
   He was meeting later today with John Major, Britain's new prime
minister. Major opened the day with a series of television
interviews in which he stressed that the question of war was ``in
Saddam Hussein's hands.''
   ``A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal won't
do,'' Major said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president
would welcome a strong endorsement from Congress along the lines of
the United Nations resolution that authorizes military force
against Iraq unless it withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   On the other hand, he said Bush told lawmakers, ``If you're
going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion and
argue about it, then that may not be that helpful, or if you're
going to water it down ....''
   Fitzwater added, ``I'm sure that every committee up there has
got 40 brilliant little staff guys running around drafting
resolutions.''
   Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, D-Calif., said he believed there
should be a declaration of war before the use of force.
   However, Beilenson said, ``It's not clear, necessarily, what the
response of the Congress would be. The president feels ... that
it's his decision to make.''
   Rep. George W. Darden, D-Ga., said Bush told the lawmakers in
direct terms that he was willing to use force. ``He told us, `I am
determined to do whatever is necessary to accomplish the purpose of
getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.''
   Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., said Bush talked bluntly about
the consequences facing Saddam.
   ``The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed
confrontation is to make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really
aware that, to quote him (Bush), that, `If we get into an armed
situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,''' Gallegly said.
   Another person at the meeting confirmed that Bush made the
remark.

<HEAD>Fed Judge Shuts Gotti for Bail Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today closed a bail hearing for
John Gotti, ruling that the alleged mob boss's rights to a fair
trial override the right of the press and the public to attend the
proceeding.
   ``The central aim of a criminal proceeding must be to try the
defendant fairly,'' U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser said.
   Glasser ordered the bail hearing to proceed and said he would
reopen his courtroom later today to announce whether Gotti and his
two co-defendants would be freed on bail or detained.
   ''It is better to err, if err we must, on the side of generosity
to the defendant's rights,'' Glasser said in closing his courtroom.
   The news organizations that had sought to keep the hearing open
awaited the judge's written decision before deciding whether an
appeal would be filed.
   Defense lawyers maintained Gotti's right to a fair trial would
be compromised if the hearing were held in open court and the
public allowed to listen to secretly recorded tapes of some of the
accused mobster's conversations.
   ``While it is true that the First Amendment guarantees to the
public and the press a qualified right to attend criminal trials,
that right is secondary to defendants' superior Sixth Amendment
right to a fair trial,'' Gotti defense lawyer John L. Pollok said
in a written motion to keep the hearing closed.
   Pollok also maintained that if reporters have access to the
tapes, ``the pre-trial media disclosure of evidence, not yet even
determined to be admissible at trial, will so poison the atmosphere
already surrounding this case as to make selecting a fair and
impartial jury and conducting a fair trial in New York virtually
impossible.''
   Nancy Richman, an attorney representing the city's major news
organizations, argued there have probably been more words written
about Gotti in recent years than about any other criminal
defendant.
   ``Nevertheless, Gotti has been acquitted three times in the past
five years, earning him the nickname the `Teflon Don,''' Ms.
Richman wrote.
   Gotti, 50, and his co-defendants - alleged underboss Frank
Locascio, 58, and reputed mob counselor Salvatore Gravano, 45 -
have been behind bars since their Dec. 11 arrest on racketeering
and conspiracy charges.
   Law enforcers said they have a half-dozen tapes in which Gotti
and the other two men are heard discussing obstruction of justice
and violence.
   Prosecutors maintained the defendants - the alleged three top
members of the Gambino crime family - are responsible for a number
of murders, are a threat to potential witnesses and the public and
should remain in jail without bail.
   A fourth defendant, 61-year-old Thomas Gambino, an alleged
captain in the crime family, is free on $500,000 bail. He was
accused of illegal gambling and loansharking.

   Freezing cold iced the West today, bringing snow to the seaside
city of Monterey, Calif., while rain pelted the Midwest and
Northeast as harsh weather ushered in the first official day of
winter.
   The Arctic storm that chilled Western states most of the week
butted against warm humid air over the South to create a band of
freezing rain from central Texas to the Great Lakes, with up to an
inch of rainfall possible.
   Rain was forecast from Louisiana to southern Maine and the
entire state of Ohio was under a flood watch today.
   Snow fell from the Midwest to the California coast overnight and
temperatures dipped as low as wind-chilled 80 below in a mountain
pass near the Idaho-Montana border.
   Thousands remained without power in the Seattle area for the
fourth day and some who resorted to burning barbecue briquettes
were hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning.
   All of Montana had subzero temperatures today, with lows down to
45 below. ``We still have cold air coming down from the north,''
said Randy Calaway of the National Weather Service in Great Falls.
   In Nevada, temperatures fell below zero as far south as a town
called Caliente, the Spanish word for hot. Fountains on the
glittery Las Vegas Strip beat back fingers of ice in 20-degree
temperatures.
   Ice and snow prompted New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers to close
state offices in Santa Fe today, giving more than 6,000 state
workers an early holiday.
   Eight inches of snow fell at Gallup, N.M., where a recreation
center was converted to an overnight shelter for stranded
travelers. Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales issued an appeal to
citizens to help drunks found outdoors.
   ``Different people calling us report drunks laying out on the
sidewalks and that the snow is covering them,'' Gonzales said. ``I
wish they would help us by taking them inside, and we could pick
them up then.''
   In Wyoming, temperatures down to 40 below caused an electrical
transmission line to contract and snap early today, leaving an
estimated 10,000 people in the Jackson area without power. The
outage prevented the Jackson Hole Ski Resort from operating.
   San Francisco had a record low for the date Thursday at 34
degrees, falling one degree below the 1908 mark. In Monterey, to
the south, the snow was a rare occurrence.
   ``I think it was really great. I really like snow,'' said Althea
Heard-Thompson, a restaurant manager who described the 15-minute
snowfall as ``really light, large flakes'' that melted quickly.
   In Los Angeles, free blankets offered on Skid Row were gone by
noon Thursday, and all city shelters were filled. In downtown San
Diego, a homeless man apparently trying to keep warm suffered
severe electrical burns after crawling into a transformer box,
police said.
   The storm system was blamed for at least 13 deaths since
Tuesday, in Washington, Iowa, Oregon, California and Oklahoma.
   Snow fell heavily in the Sierra Nevada, with up to 1{ feet at
Mammoth Mountain ski area, where less than a week ago the resort
opened a soup kitchen for seasonal workers left jobless by lack of
snow.
   In Colorado, snowfall closed Wolf Creek pass and the Wolf Creek
ski area. But the weather thrilled ski industry officials.
   ``This is clearly a holiday bonus,'' said Cathy Kruzic,
spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA. ``It's wonderful
powder.''
   Washington state, first hit by the Arctic storm, got no relief
today.
   ``We're packed wall-to-wall,'' said Calvin McVey, director of
the 206-bed Gospel Mission homeless shelter in Seattle, where
another 145 people slept on the floor.
   About 18,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark overnight
and utility spokeswoman Teri Van Duine said some could be without
power for the weekend.
   Five people came to Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle
with carbon monoxide poisoning after using charcoal briquettes
indoors or improperly ventilated portable heaters and generators,
spokeswoman Rena Shawver said.
   Sinking temperatures and winds gusting to nearly 60 mph snapped
power cables in Utah and up to 2 feet of new snow prompted
avalanche warnings.
   Physicians say the wind-chilled temperatures are not to be taken
lightly.
   ``Below a minus 25 degrees wind chill, that's when it's
dangerous,'' said Dr. Robert Harms, an emergency room physician at
a Sioux Falls, S.D. hospital. ``If you have exposed skin, it can
freeze in one minute or less.''
   Weather-related traffic deaths killed four people in Northern
California, five in Oregon and one in Oklahoma. In Washington, a
man was fatally crushed by a falling tree and a homeless man froze
to death in Seattle.
   An 11-year-old girl in Iowa was killed when the truck she was
riding in lost control on an ice-covered highway and was hit by a
truck.
   On the eastern side of the Arctic front, heavy rain caused the
Ohio River to flood low-lying roads.
   Two teen-agers rescued a 79-year-old woman near Whipple, Ohio,
when her car stalled in 5 feet of water. A Marietta attorney said
he may have to hire a boat to get guests to his daughter's wedding
Saturday because of flooded roads.
   Fifteen people were evacuated from their homes in northeastern
Arkansas early today when a line of strong thunderstorms caused
flooding in the towns of Paragould and Bono.

   Down the hall from where military brass are
laying war plans for the Persian Gulf, scantily clad women in (and
partly out of) Army uniforms are staring out from the pages of a
new offering at the Pentagon bookstore.
   It's the 1991 ``Operation Desert Shield Calendar,'' an
eye-catcher amid the bookstore's drab volumes on military history
and weapons of war.
   In large, glossy, color photographs - one for each month, plus
extras for good measure - the female models pose with some of the
trappings of war: rifles, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition
cannisters, helmets, sand bags and dog tags.
   ``Miss February'' wears a flight suit pulled up just to her hips
and has a pilot's helmet pressed against her bare chest. ``Miss
December'' sprawls on an Army-issue canvas cot in the sand, attired
in camouflage underwear that hardly looks like Army issue.
   The privately published calendar sells for $12.95 but it is
unlikely it would be allowed into Saudi Arabia under the strict
laws against public displays of female flesh.
   At the bottom of its cover, below a deeply plunging neckline, is
the statement ``A portion of the proceeds will be used to assist
hostage and military family support groups.''
   And on the inside is a message ``to the men and women of
Operation Desert Shield'' from the project's co-founder, James J.
Rooney Jr. It says in part:
   ``This calendar, reminiscent of the pinup posters of wars long
past, represents but a small gesture of appreciation for your
sacrifices and suffering.''
   At a phone number listed for Rooney's company, RML &amp; Associates
Inc. of Hawthorne, Calif., callers are referred to the project's
promotion director, CarolAnn Merritt. She said Rooney and his
business partner, Rogelio Morales Jr., are Air Force officers
trying their hand at their first publishing venture.
   ``It was done in good faith,'' Ms. Merritt said, adding that
although no money is in the till yet from the calendar's
distributors and marketers, ``We hope we'll be able to donate
thousands'' of dollars to the Yellow Ribbon Foundation, which she
described as a private group aiding hostage victims' families.

   Democratic House leaders no longer plan to
present a surtax on millionaires as the first order of business
when Congress convenes next month, but the proposal may resurface
later, aides said Friday.
   Instead, Democrats are focusing on piecing together a package
aimed at promoting ``economic growth and tax fairness,'' said one
aide to a top Democrat. They hope to have the legislation ready by
the time President Bush presents his State of the Union address on
Jan. 29, the aide said.
   ``Don't focus too much on whether it's H.R. 1 or not,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   H.R. 1 is the number assigned to the first bill introduced in
the House at the beginning of a session of Congress. The 102nd
Congress convenes Jan. 3, when lawmakers are likely to introduce
their first bills.
   The official said Democratic leaders still had not decided what
would be in the economic growth package, but would not rule out a
surtax on millionaires.
   Until now, Democratic leaders had spoken of making the session's
first bill a tax hike on the rich. The issue was a big political
winner for Democrats during this year's budget battle with the
White House. They used the proposal - and Republican opposition to
it - to characterize the GOP as the party of the wealthy.
   But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, told Bush this week that he would not
immediately pursue the surtax, an aide to the Illinois Democrat
said Friday.
   Bush told Rostenkowski on Tuesday that he would not include his
plan to cut capital gains tax rates in the fiscal 1992 budget he
will send Congress on Feb. 4, the aide said. Democrats have fought
the capital gains tax reduction, arguing it would mainly help the
rich and that it would diminish government revenues.
   Bush, who has twice waged losing battles to reduce the tax
levied on sales of property, said publicly Tuesday that he would
abandon the idea because he could not find savings elsewhere to pay
for it - as required under new budget procedures.
   ``If Republicans want to make a big fight over capital gains or
other proposals that disproportionately benefit upper-income
people, we'd start talking about countermeasures,'' the
Rostenkowski aide said. ``If not, it might be better for everyone
to focus on recession and war.''
   The millionaire surtax proved so popular this year, however,
that rank-and-file Democrats say they will push for it anyway.
   ``It will be spent a dozen times over in the first week of
Congress,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y. ``Everybody who has a
plan to expand labor programs, education, unemployment insurance,
whatever, will pay for it with the millionaire surtax.''

   The World Bank said Friday it no longer was
counting on payments from Iraq and was starting to put aside
reserves to cover $51.4 million owed by Iraq.
   The bank, owned by 154 countries including Iraq, lends about $21
billion a year and is the biggest single source of aid to the Third
World. The United States holds the largest block of shares.
   Iraq's foreign debt totalled $23.7 billion last year, according
to the Central Intelligence Agency. Despite its wealth from oil,
Iraq borrowed heavily because of its long war with Iran.
   The bank's decision, effective last Monday, was announced
Friday. It put Iraq on ``non-accrual'' status, normal practice when
a country is six months behind on its payments. It means that
payments from the debtor country are no longer listed on the bank's
books, since payments have not actually arrived.
   There are $10.2 million in payments overdue from Iraq: $7.1
million principal and $3.1 million interest.
   The bank also will put aside 1 percent of the debt each month as
a reserve, in case it is never repaid.
   Other countries froze Iraq's assets following its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. As a result, President Saddam Hussein's
government has been unable to make payments, the bank said in a
statement. After 75 days of not paying, Iraq lost the right to new
loans from the bank.
   Eight other countries are also on non-accrual status because
they have been unwilling or unable to pay: Syria, Liberia, Zambia,
Somalia, Peru, Panama, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Two others, Guyana
and Honduras, have paid up and returned to normal status, so that
they are once again entitled to borrow from the bank.

<HEAD>Canal Security Stepped Up Against Possible Iraqi Sabotage</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUEZ, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security has been increased in the Suez Canal
to thwart a possible Iraqi attempt to sink a vessel and block the
strategic waterway, canal officials said Friday.
   The canal is important for oil shipping as well as for the
United States and other countries who are massing warships in the
Persian Gulf region.
   The new security measures include putting any cement carriers at
the rear of canal convoys, so that if they are sunk they would not
block other vessels. Once sunk, cement carriers are extremely
difficult to clear because of the wet cement.
   The canal carries much of Western Europe's oil and an extended
blockage would hit that region's economy hard. It could be almost
ruinous to Egypt, which is dependent on the more than $1.5 billion
in foreign exchange earned annually by the canal.
   Intelligence sources in Cairo said Friday the new canal measures
were in line with a security upgrade ordered nationwide on
strategic installations like the canal, the Aswan High Dam in
southern Egypt and vital industries.
   The measures have been in effect since soon after Egypt
condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and sent troops to join
the U.S.-led multinational force deployed in the gulf region.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to punish Arab
states that sided with Kuwait in the crisis.
   Canal officials said authorities recently began careful checks
of the itineraries and ownership of cement-carrying ships,
particularly those coming from the Far East or the gulf region.
   On Friday, a Romanian ship carrying cement, the 38,000-ton
Beius, was the last of 30 vessels to transit the 101-mile long
canal. Its origin and destination were unclear.
   The canal officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Suez Canal Authority took the additional safeguard of
dispatching two tugboats to follow the Romanian ship through the
waterway.
   They said more Egyptian harbor workers than usual have been
boarding cement-carrying ships. Such workers provide dockside and
harbor services at the southern and northern ends of the canal,
Suez and Port Said.
   In addition, they report to Egyptian intelligence on anything
unusual found aboard ships.
   Despite the canal's value to Egypt, President Gamal Abdel Nasser
in 1956 scuttled two ships carrying concrete and stones to block
the waterway. He aimed to hurt Western economies in reprisal for a
concerted military attack on Egypt by Britain, France and Israel.

   Courts rejected two separate requests
today to resume feeding Nancy Cruzan a week after nourishment was
halted to the woman who's in a vegetative state.
   The Missouri Supreme Court today denied a second request by
anti-abortion activists who oppose euthanasia, and a Cole County
court ruled that Yvette Williams, a Kansas City woman who also
asked the state to restore sustenance to Ms. Cruzan, has no
standing to file suit. Her request was previously denied by a
Missouri appeals court.
   One last legal recourse remained for those seeking to reconnect
her feeding tube. A hearing was scheduled this afternoon in U.S.
District Court in Kansas City to consider a lawsuit to order the
state to reconnect the tube.
   The Rev. Pat Mahoney, director of the Center for Christian
Activism in Boca Raton, Fla., alleged in that suit that Ms.
Cruzan's civil rights were violated when the tube was disconnected.
   The 33-year-old Ms. Cruzan, the central figure in the first
right-to-die case considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, has been in
a persistent vegetative state since suffering massive brain damage
in a 1983 traffic accident.
   On Thursday, the Missouri Supreme Court and the Missouri Court
of Appeals-Southern District in Springfield denied requests to
reconnect the tube.
   Meanwhile in Jefferson City, about 15 protesters staged a rally
in the office of state Attorney General William Webster.
   Andrew Burnett, a spokesman for the group, said the protesters
would not leave the office until Webster intervenes in court with a
motion to replace Ms. Cruzan's feeding tube.
   But Deputy Attorney General Jim Deutsch said the office had no
legal standing in the case.
   The office defended Missouri law to the U.S. Supreme Court as it
was required to do, Deutsch said. Once the high court ruled on the
issue, the state was no longer an appropriate party in the case, he
said.
   Food and water was removed from Ms. Cruzan seven days ago at a
Mount Vernon rehabilitation center. Her condition remained listed
as deteriorating today.
   Rehabilitation center spokeswoman Barbara Shoun said
demonstrators pitched tents on the lawn outside the main entrance
and endured a night of freezing rain and temperatures in the
mid-teens. Police did not plan to remove the tents, she said.
   The Lawrence County sheriff's office said five of the 19
demonstrators jailed Tuesday for trespassing and unlawful assembly
posted$1,000 bond each Thursday and were released. The others
remain in custody, invoking the name Nancy Cruzan and promising to
stay there, fasting, until she is fed or dies.
   A week after they won approval for the the removal of their
daughter's feeding tube, Joe and Joyce Cruzan have no regrets about
their decision to let her die, their lawyer, William Colby, said.
   ``Knowing Nancy as only a family could, they knew she wouldn't
want to go on in her present condition. They know they've done the
right thing,'' Colby said Thursday.
   After a probate judge ruled on Dec. 14 that her feeding tube
could be disconnected, doctors said she would die within two weeks.
   ``It's getting late. She will be dead if we don't move
quickly,'' said Randall Terry, founder of the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue.
   ``Oh, man,'' Terry said after the state Supreme Court's decision
on Thursday, ``Isn't there one judge in this state with the moral
integrity to save this woman?''
   After a ruling to disconnect the tube was overturned by the
state Supreme Court in 1988, Ms. Cruzan's parents appealed to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   The high court ruled that the tube could only be disconnected if
there was ``clear and convincing evidence'' that was what Ms.
Cruzan would want.
   At a hearing last month, former co-workers testified Ms. Cruzan
told them she would never want to live in a vegetative state.

<HEAD>Genetically Engineered Drug Approved for Rare Immune Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
approved a new genetically engineered drug to treat a rare,
life-threatening immune disorder that strikes mostly boys.
   People with chronic granulomatous disease, or CGD, are missing a
key element of the immune system, leaving them susceptible to
bacterial and fungal infections and reliant on high doses of
antibiotics.
   The FDA said the new therapy is the first approved genetically
engineered form of gamma interferon, a naturally occurring,
infection-fighting protein produced by certain types of white blood
cells.
   Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif., will market the
drug under the brand name Actimmune.
   The drug needs to be injected only three times a week in most
cases, which means ``we can now expect patients to have a more
normal day-to-day life,'' said Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA.
   Fewer than 400 Americans have CGD, federal health officials
said. Because it is so rare, the drug was developed under the FDA's
``orphan drug'' program, designed to encourage development of drugs
to treat rare diseases.
   About 80 percent of children with the disorder suffer unusually
frequent or severe infections within their first two years of life.
Sometimes these infections can retard normal growth or lead to
death, the FDA said.
   Common side effects of the drug include headache, fever, rashes
and chills, but these were transient, the FDA said.
   Long-term effects of the drug are not known, but will be
evaluated in post-marketing studies, the FDA said.
   However, because the drug has been shown to cause miscarriages
in animals, the FDA said it should not be used during pregnancy
unless its benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.

   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey is giving
$50,000 to help a church in its annual holiday grocery giveaway to
the poor, the church said.
   ``Because she is a very caring person who reaches out to the
poor, she immediately responded,'' the Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor
of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said Thursday.
   Glide Memorial has distributed thousands of bags of groceries to
the poor since 1979. But Williams reported earlier this week that
holiday contributions were down 37 percent from 1989 and asked the
public for donations.
   Winfrey learned of the appeal through poet Maya Angelou, a
member of Glide Memorial, and called Williams to say she would be
sending a check, the church said.
   The church planned to start its holiday giveaway of more than
10,000 bags of groceries today. The church said that while
donations have declined, the need for the groceries has risen.

   DETROIT (AP) - Now that the United States and the Soviet Union
have made up after all these years, Mayor Coleman Young has decided
the city can do the same with one of its most famous suburbs.
   Young, 72, will head west and Dearborn Mayor Michael Guido, 36,
will head east for a one-day job swap as part of the Michigan
Municipal League annual Mayor's Exchange Day.
   The May affair will underscore the good relationship between
Young and Guido, Young spokesman Bob Berg said Friday.
   The cities have co-existed uneasily since the early 1920s, when
automotive pioneer Henry Ford built the massive Rouge complex in
Dearborn. Blacks were hired at the plant but were discouraged from
living in the suburb.
   Today, only about 5 percent of Dearborn's approximately 100,000
residents are black. More than 70 percent of Detroit's population
is black.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - The rock band Van Halen filed a federal suit
against 2 Live Crew claiming the rap group used a Van Halen guitar
riff on their controversial album ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be.''
   The U.S. District Court suit filed this week seeks more than
$300,000 for copyright infringement and unfair competition.
   At issue is guitarist Eddie Van Halen's famous refrain in the
1978 hit record ``Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love.'' The suit claims 2
Live Crew used the music for a song called ``The Funk Shop'' on the
rap group's album.
   The suit was filed on behalf of Van Halen and Warner-Chappell
Music against 2 Live Crew and Luke Records.
   Debbie Bennett, spokeswoman for the rap group and Luke Records
in Coconut Grove, Fla., was not immediately available Friday for
comment on the suit, a receptionist said.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Country singer Rodney Crowell says his
family celebrates Christmas with a live tree, recycled wrapping
paper and by having trees planted for friends instead of sending
Christmas cookies.
   Crowell says 'tis the season to think about stewardship of the
Earth, and offered a few tips on how to do so.
   The Grammy-award winning singer-songwriter and his wife, singer
Roseanne Cash, are among the Nashville music community's most
outspoken environmentalists.
   Besides planting their own tree in the backyard of their
Nashville home after Christmas, Crowell said his family tries to
make sure when the tree lights are on, that other lights are off.
And he says they use candles as much as possible.
   ``To acknowledge the beauty of the human spirit, love and the
Christ-child part of Christmas to me is about compassion,'' Crowell
said in a recent interview. ``When you develop compassion for human
beings, it's a trickling off and you develop compassion for plant
life and for animal life in the world.''

   Air raid sirens blared and about 1 milion Iraqis carrying
blankets and food streamed out of Baghdad early today in an
evacuation drill to test the nation's readiness for war.
   As Iraqis jammed roads out of the capital, U.S. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said today in Saudi Arabia that war with Iraq
was increasingly likely. ``Absolute, total victory'' is the only
option if war breaks out, he said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was no less confident, predicting
victory in any war with the U.S.-led multinational forces. He also
stood by his refusal to pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline.
   Germany's ZDF television network broadcast the Saddam interview
today, saying it had been conducted in Baghdad on Thursday.
   ``In the event of war, there will be great losses, not just in
terms of human life. Those who now say yes to war will be
responsible,'' Saddam said. ``Allah is on our side, so we will
defeat the aggressors.''
   In Germany today, the government said it was investigating U.S.
suspicions that German companies are violating trade sanctions
against Iraq. One firm denied giving Iraq sensitive nuclear
know-how and equipment.
   The government confirmed a report that Washington has given it a
list of German companies suspected of violating the U.N. embargo.
Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the U.S. allegations were
being investigated but no proof has been found of deliveries that
violate the sanctions.
   President Bush was to meet later today with John Major,
Britain's new prime minister. In several television interviews
today, Major said the question of war was ``in Saddam Hussein's
hands.''
   Also today, the U.S. military command said eight American
soldiers have been poisoned by home-brewed alcohol and hospitalized
since Sunday.
   The soldiers, from the 101st Airborne Division, are the first
known casualties of home-brewed liquor since U.S. forces were
deployed in Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country that bans all alcohol.
   During the evacuation drill many Iraqis stayed home, residents
said.
   Participants ran on foot to civil defense centers in Baghdad or
sped out of town in cars. Hundreds of buses waiting at centers took
Iraqis to shelters north, east and south of the city.
   Roads leading out of the capital were jammed with thousands of
cars, trucks, buses and even carriages pulled by tractors.The drill
began at 7 a.m. and ended five hours later.
   Iraq has been preparing for war since the U.N. Security Council
authorized force to remove Iraq from Kuwait if it does not leave
the emirate by Jan. 15. Iraqi media carry instructions for building
bomb shelters and courses in civil defense and first-aid.
   U.S. officials have suggested Iraq's cities could be bombed
heavily in the event of war. Gen. Michael Dugan, the air force
chief of staff, was fired in September for revealing contingency
plans that involved bombing Baghdad.
   The evacuation drill today was conducted for the half of Baghdad
that lies on the east bank of the Tigris River, but only about 1
million of the 2 million residents participated, said residents,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A second exercise Saturday will cover west Baghdad.
   Basra, Iraq's second-largest city with a million people, was
evacuated in a similar exercise Thursday.
   In Saudi Arabia, Cheney told troops that war was closer.
   ``It increasingly looks like (Saddam's) not getting the message
and we'll have to use force,'' Cheney said. ``The only acceptable
outcome, if hostilities begin, is absolute, total victory.''
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said
that if an attack were lauched: ``We will launch it violently, we
will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we canget it
over as quickly as possible and there's no question who won.''
   Bush met with members of Congress on Thursday and told them he
believed Saddam was underestimating U.S. power and intentions,
several legislators said.
   Saddam must be made aware that ``if we get into an armed
situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,'' Rep. Elton Gallegly,
R-Calif., quoted Bush as saying. Bush's remark was confirmed by
another person at the meeting.
   A Pentagon spokesman said 10,000 more U.S. troops reached Saudi
Arabia this week, bringing the American force to 280,000. The
spokesman, Bob Hall, said U.S. intelligence sources put the Iraqi
force in and around Kuwait at 510,000.

   A federal judge refused today to order
state health officials to resume feeding Nancy Cruzan, a week after
nourishment was halted to the woman who's in a vegetative state.
   Earlier today, the Missouri Supreme Court and a Cole County
court turned down two separate, similar requests.
   U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple in Kansas City, who issued the
ruling, scolded protesters for going from court to court seeking
such an action.
   ``This court is mindful of the fact that this is the fifth
petition of its kind filed this week in various Missouri courts,''
he said. The four previous petitions all have been denied.
   ``In light of the history of this case, this court finds that
any further action would be frivolous at best, and an abuse of the
legal process,'' the ruling said.
   The judge had set a 1 p.m. hearing, but canceled it and issued
the written ruling instead. He declined to comment, but court
employees said the judge had been besieged with phone calls asking
him to intervene.
   The federal court petition was filed by the Rev. Patrick
Mahoney, director of the Center for Christian Activism in Boca
Raton, Fla. He alleged Ms. Cruzan's civil rights are being
violated.
   Whipple ruled that Mahoney had no standing to ask for federal
action.
   Food and water was removed from Ms. Cruzan a week ago at a Mount
Vernon rehabilitation center. Her condition remained listed as
deteriorating today.
   Earlier today, Missouri's high court denied a second request by
anti-abortion activists who oppose euthanasia. The Cole County

   The former president of a Dallas thrift whose
failure could cost taxpayers $2 billion agreed to plead guilty to
fraud charges and pay $16 million in penalties and restitution, the
Justice Department said today.
   The Justice Department's plea agreement with Edwin T. McBirney
III, former president and chairman of the Sunbelt Savings
Association, was made public a day after a federal court jury
convicted another Texas S&amp;L operator, Don R. Dixon.
   ``Federal prosecutors have dealt a one-two punch to the savings
and loan crooks this week,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
in a statement.
   ``McBirney's agreement to plead guilty, coupled with yesterday's
conviction of Don Dixon, caps a year of relentless and
unprecedented pressure on thrift thieves,'' Thornburgh said.
   McBirney, who was indicted in July on 17 counts, agreed to plead
guilty to four counts of bank fraud, filing a false corporate tax
return, causing a false statement to be filed by Sunbelt and
misapplying $250,000 in Sunbelt funds.
   The bank fraud count stems from a $700 million deal to finance
the purchase of real estate in Southern California by a Sunbelt
subsidiary.
   McBirney agreed to admit that he arranged a fraudulent $30
million reciprocal loan arrangement with Western Savings
Association, another Dallas thrift, to help finance the real estate
deal, the Justice Department said.
   He could be sentenced to up to 15 years imprisonment under the
terms of the guilty plea. McBirney, 37, also agreed to pay $7.5
million in restitution and $8.5 million to settle civil claims by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The Justice Department announcement did not say when McBirney,
who agreed to cooperate with the government's continuing
investigation of the S&amp;L scandal, would appear in federal court to
enter the guilty plea.
   Sour loans made by Sunbelt, and its merger in 1988 with a
healthier S&amp;L, are expected to cost the government $2 billion in
bailout funds, regulators say.
   On Thursday, Dixon, another Dallas S&amp;L operator, was convicted
of illegally spending money from his Vernon Savings and Loan
Association on prostitutes and a California beach house.
   Dixon, 52, could be sentenced to as many as 115 years in prison
and fined $5.75 million for his convictions on 23 fraud counts.

   Administration officials at odds over energy
conservation met Friday with President Bush, trying to sway him on
alternative car fuels and other possible ingredients of his
national energy strategy.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins, who made a presentation Friday
at the meeting of Bush's Economic Policy Council, is recommending
that the strategy include both increased fuel efficiency standards
and a requirement for greater use of nongasoline fuels.
   Those proposals are supported by the Agriculture Department, and
by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly.
   But other advisers, including White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu and chief White House economist Michael Boskin, are fighting
the proposals on grounds that they would be costly and involve
excessive government regulation. Others siding with Sununu,
according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, include
Bush's domestic policy adviser Roger Porter and budget director
Richard Darman.
   After Watkins spoke Friday, Porter and Boskin ``pounded away''
at what they consider the unreasonable options, one participant
said.
   Many planks of the proposed strategy have received consensus
approval from the various government agencies involved in the
talks. Members of the Cabinet-level council agreed to meet again
with Bush on the sticky issues remaining after he returns Jan. 1
from his holiday stay at Camp David, Md., officials said.
   Considerable discussion Friday centered on whether auto
manufacturers should be required to increase production of cars
that can use alternative fuels, said one official. He characterized
the debate, with Bush present, as a ``healthy discussion'' that did
not reach the acrimonious levels of a council meeting on the
subject last week.
   The strategy contains 45 different measures dealing with the
nation's future energy needs and how to avoid reliance on foreign
oil
   The document, expected to be finished early next year, comes at
a sensitive time on the international front in light of the crisis
in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
   Among the options that have not produced argument within the
administration is a proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to oil exploration and development.
   Bush has long supported such a move, but it is expected to run
into heavy opposition in Congress and from environmentalists.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Friday's auction to their lowest level in nearly
2{ years.
   The Treasury Department sold $10.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.52 percent, down from 6.78 percent
on Monday. Another $10.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.57 percent, down from 6.77 percent
earlier this week.
   The auction, which normally would have been held next Monday,
was pushed up to Friday because of Christmas Eve.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 6.51
percent on June 20, l988, and six-month bills averaged 6.50 percent
on May 16, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 6.72 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,835.20 and 6.89 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,667.90.

   A shipment of magazines for U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia is being held up for about a week because they are
wrapped in a cover bearing cigarette advertising unaccompanied by a
required disclaimer, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The approximately 101,000 magazines were the first shipment to
be collected by Operation Desert News, a Charleston, S.C.,
organization that distributes reading matter to U.S. troops in the
Persian Gulf.
   The shipment was held up, however, when the organization decided
to have the magazines wrapped in special covers with the name of
the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. on the front and the trademark of the
company's Camel cigarettes on the back.
   The wrappers should have had a disclaimer stating that the
federal government was not endorsing the sponsor or its products or
paying for the covers, said Maj. Maureen DeCiantis, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, Fla.
   ``In this case it was not done, because Desert News didn't know
they had to do it, and we didn't know they had a tobacco company as
a backer,'' DeCiantis said.
   Pentagon officials found a solution to the problem Friday.
   ``We're going to print the declaration on the front and take the
camel off the back,'' said Lt. Col. Henry Wyatt, a spokesman for
the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the shipments. He said
it was expected to take about a week.
   The magazine publisher who organized the shipment said he was
vexed by the delay.
   ``It's magazines that we're sending. We're not sending
cigarettes,'' said Tim Karnes, publisher of Auction Guide and the
organizer of Operation Desert News.
   Karnes said the magazines, which include Life, Fine Woodworking
and Modern Drummer, were donated to the organization by the
publishers.
   ``Everybody involved knew that R.J. Reynolds was the sponsor,''
Karnes added.
   All the magazines, some of which contain cigarette advertising,
were approved by the Defense Department, he said. The covers were
printed Wednesday at Quebecor Printing USA in St. Cloud, Minn.
   ``I don't think the advertisement about cigarettes should
jeopardize the ability to provide this reading material, which is
just desperately needed for morale,'' Karnes said in a telephone
interview from Acapulco, Mexico, where he was vacationing.
   Reynolds is the organization's only corporate sponsor so far,
although Karnes said the group was seeking others.
   Karnes said the organization submitted a rough draft of the
first page of the cover, which may not have contained the R.J.
Reynolds identification, and did not submit the back page.
   He said the organization did not realize any disclaimer would be
needed.

<HEAD>Former Trump Exec Says Trump Attorneys Threatened Him Over His

<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump isn't waiting
for the publication of a book exposing the underbelly of his casino
empire to try and squash the story, the author says.
   The book, ``Trumped: The Decline and Fall of Donald Trump'' was
written by former Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino President Jack
O'Donnell. It is due to be published May 1.
   O'Donnell, the chief operating officer at rival Merv Griffin's
Resorts Casino Hotel, said Trump attorneys barged into his Resorts
office unannounced on Wednesday and tried to intimidate him.
   Trump on Thursday denied the charge.
   ``Jack O'Donnell is a man who is a disgruntled former
employee,'' Trump said in a telephone interview from New York City.
``He went to work for Merv Griffin. I'm surprised Merv Griffin
would allow him to write such a book. But life is full of
surprises.''
   O'Donnell said in a statement that Trump has threatened to
disclose ``defamatory and untruthful allegations'' if the book is
published. O'Donnell declined to elaborate.
   O'Donnell angrily resigned from Trump Plaza in April, saying he
could no longer stand working for Trump.
   Trump's casinos have undergone a difficult year. Both Trump
Plaza and Trump Castle Casino Resort By The Bay have lost business
to Trump's third casino, the Taj Mahal Casino Resort, which opened
April 2.
   The Taj Mahal is scheduled to file for bankruptcy under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as part of a restructuring of its
$675 million in debt.
   Trump said he would wait to read the book before deciding
whether he would pursue any legal action.

   Three years after Joe and Joyce Cruzan
asked the courts to let their severely brain-injured daughter die
with dignity, her impending death has become a focus of protests
and legal maneuvers by strangers.
   Nineteen people were arrested Tuesday after they burst into the
Missouri Rehabilitation Center and tried to reach Nancy Cruzan's
room to reconnect her feeding tube, which was removed Dec. 14.
   Anti-euthanasia activists had no success in asking various
courts to force the state to resume feeding Ms. Cruzan. Their
appeals were rejected Friday by the state Supreme Court, Cole
County Court and the U.S. District Court. Missouri's highest courts
rejected other appeals Thursday.
   About 15 demonstrators continued a round-the-clock vigil on the
hospital steps Friday, praying, singing and holding signs that read
``Please Feed Nancy Cruzan.''
   From their daughter's heavily tinted window on the second floor,
Joe and Joyce Cruzan can see the demonstrators, but avoid contact
with them.
   ``I would have thought the protests would have bothered them but
they are in so much pain from what would cause us all pain, having
a child die. Really, that is their focus,'' said the couple's
attorney, William Colby.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been in a persistent vegetative state since
a car accident on Jan. 11, 1983. Doctors said her condition is
irreversible, and her parents won court approval last month to
remove the feeding tube.
   Doctors expected Ms. Cruzan to die within two weeks of the
tube's removal. Her condition was listed as deteriorating Friday, a
week after the tube was removed.
   Colby said the Cruzans have received a ``massive outpouring of
support'' from people across the country. ``The mail and calls that
we've received have been 40- or 50-to-1 in strong support of the
family,'' he said.
   At the same time, anti-euthanasia activists have converged on
the red-brick rehabilitation center in this southwestern Missouri
community of 3,400 and claimed the Cruzan case as an extension of
their cause.
   Fourteen demonstrators remained jailed Friday, giving their name
as Nancy Cruzan and vowing to stay there and fast until she is fed
or dies.
   ``This may be the most important story in the pro-life
history,'' said Bob Jewitt, a spokesman for Operation Rescue, a
group best known for its anti-abortion protests.
   Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed guardian, who told a probate judge
that letting her die was in her best interest, called Operation
Rescue founder Randall Terry and the other demonstrators
``publicity-seeking scofflaws.''
   ``They are acting through ignorance. They have no idea of the
facts of her situation,'' said Thad McCanse, a Carthage attorney.
   Doctors say Ms. Cruzan is oblivious to her surroundings, cannot
speak and does not feel emotions or pain. She suffers from a
variety of ailments, including severely contorted limbs, vomiting,
bleeding gums and diarrhea.
   Dr. Ronald Cranford, a Minneapolis neurologist who has examined
Ms. Cruzan, called her a ``prisoner of medical technology'' who has
no hope for recovery.
   ``The question is, will the withdrawal of feeding tubes become
more widespread in letting people like Nancy Cruzan die?
Absolutely,'' said Cranford, chairman of the American Academy of
Neurology's ethics committee.
   Demonstrators such as Yvette Williams, a part-time caretaker of
severely disabled children who was a plaintiff in one of the
lawsuits, have expressed concern over such prospects.
   ``Our laws protect life,'' Miss Williams said in a statement.
``What is happening here offends me. I cannot in conscience be a
party to the killing of Nancy Cruzan.''
   McCanse disagreed.
   ``What's inhumane is maintaining her feeding tube so she can
live another 30 or 40 years with extensive, irreversible brain
damage. If there are any barbarians involved in this, it's the
people making a circus out of this,'' McCanse said.
   As the ethical debate rages on around them, the Cruzans have
been at Nancy's side virtually since the tube was removed.
   The couple, who have two other daughters, do not regret their
decision, Colby said.
   ``Knowing Nancy as only a family could, they knew she wouldn't
want to go on in her present condition. They know they've done the
right thing,'' Colby said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with Eduard
Shevardnadze Friday, reportedly to discuss some way of keeping his
longtime ally in the government following his sudden resignation as
foreign minister.
   In parliament, reformers turned Shevardnadze's unexpected
resignation into a rallying cry. A parade of speakers echoed the
62-year-old diplomat's warning that hard-liners were pushing the
country toward dictatorship.
   Gorbachev talked privately with Shevardnadze for two hours about
the Persian Gulf crisis and conventional arms reductions in Europe,
presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko told reporters.
   Ignatenko called the session ``an ordinary meeting between the
president and his foreign minister,'' the independent Interfax news
agency said.
   Presidential aide Georgi Shakhnazarov said Gorbachev also had
planned to ask Shevardnadze why he resigned: ``Was it political
motives, or personal motives? And depending on the answers, it
would be possible to decide whether to ask him to continue working
in that role, or in another role, or to agree on something else.''
   It was not clear whether Gorbachev intended to ask Shevardnadze
to continue as foriegn minister or to take another post. A
Shevardnadze aide said Thursday the resignation was
``irreversible.''
   Earlier Friday, Tass quoted Shakhnazarov as saying Shevardnadze
would stay ``on Gorbachev's team,'' but offered no other details.
   There was no further word late Friday about the meeting or
whether Gorbachev had reached any decision about the foreign
minister's job. Shevardnadze made no public comment.
   It also was not known whether Shevardnadze would take part in a
Moscow arms control summit Feb. 11-13 between Gorbachev and
President Bush.
   On Thursday, Shevardnadze stunned Gorbachev, the parliament and
the world community by resigning.
   In what he called ``the briefest and most difficult speech of my
life,'' Shevardnadze said reformers had ``gone and hidden in the
bushes'' and ``dictatorship is coming.''
   ``No one knows what kind of dictatorship it will be, what kind
of dictator will come, and what order things will take,''
Shevardnadze said.
   His resignation prompted worldwide concern over the future of
reform in the Soviet Union.
   Hard-liners have urged Gorbachev to impose a state of emergency
in republics ridden by ethnic conflict and separatist movements.
Gorbachev has asked the Congress to consider constitutional
amendments to strengthen his power to deal with such trouble spots.
   The hard-liners also had criticized Soviet endorsement of a U.N.
resolution on the use of force in the gulf, but their main
criticism was over domestic issues.
   A Ukrainian lawmaker shook up the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies on Friday afternoon by saying a ``right-wing
reactionary coup'' was brewing.
   ``Reactionaries, centralists, and imperialists have united and
are on the attack,'' lawmaker Vladimir Chernyak said. ``At the head
of the coup stands Gorbachev. It's possible he himself doesn't know
it. By demanding for himself more and more powers, he is creating
the legal basis for a dictatorship - maybe not for himself
personally.''
   Chernyak, an economist elected from Kiev, said hard-liners
already have succeeded in forcing Shevardnadze and former Interior
Minister Vadim Bakatin from their jobs.
   ``Why does Gorbachev respond to the right and not the left?
There's no mystery. The whole thing is that Gorbachev is the son of
his party and a defender of its interests,'' Chernyak said.
   Gorbachev sat forward in his chair, listening intently to the
Ukrainian.
   Chernyak also called for direct elections for a new president
and parliament.
   A representative of the Inter-Regional Group - a reform faction
of lawmakers whose members included the late human rights
campaigner Andrei Sakharov - called on Gorbachev to reject pressure
from hard-liners.
   ``We share the alarm of Foreign Minister Shevardnadze about the
possibility of the breakup of democratic processes in the country
and the danger of the establishment of a reactionary
dictatorship,'' said Vitaly A. Chelyshev.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a prominent reformer, took the
podium to say Shevardnadze's warning was ``more than serious.''
   He said people were losing faith in the ability to solve
problems democratically. ``If that is so, then only dictatorship is
left.''
   However, army chief of staff Mikhail Moiseyev disputed
Shevardnadze's warning of a ``coming dictatorship,'' and said there
was no reason to impose a state of emergency as is feared by some.
   ``It is most regrettable that he did this as such an unsuitable
moment, when the Congress has to discuss more important tasks (and)
find mutually acceptable decisions to consolidate all forces and
extricate the country from grave crisis,'' Moiseyev said, according
to Tass.
   In their meeting, Gorbachev also planned to ask why Shevardnadze
never consulted him before resigning, the president's aide said.
   ``Shevardnadze was his companion, a person he worked with,
placed trust in. So if he was leaving, he should have said
something,'' Shakhnazarov said.
   Shevardnadze has won international praise since being appointed
in 1985 by Gorbachev, who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize for
foreign policy successes.
   Under Shevardnadze's stewardship, the Soviet Union pulled its
troops out of Afghanistan, negotiated cuts in nuclear arsenals,
allowed East European countries to oust Communist regimes and ended
antagonistic relations with Cold War foes.

   In parts of the nation's capital, violence
doesn't seem to rattle the kids anymore. Not even the classmates of
four junior high school students shot after class - along with a
6-year-old girl - by rivals firing from a passing car.
   ``They look at it like, `It's just the neighborhood,''' said a
teacher Friday at the imposing cinder-block Shaw Junior High
School. ```It's another day at the office. No big deal,''' he said,
requesting anonymity.
   In many communities, the day after a multiple shooting of
children - the youngest 6 and the eldest 15 - would have meant a
rush of counselors into the local schools to calm the fears of
students who must walk the same tough streets.
   But not here.
   Here, the students generally did not mention the shootings. And
teachers made no special effort to draw them out, the one teacher
said as students chatted animatedly during lunch period.
   Three arrests had been made. Two of the students were released
from the hospital. Three remained, all improving.
   This is the city that has had a record 471 homicides this year,
30 of them juveniles, according to the police count. This is the
city that has seen an additional 1,163 people shot, 204 of them
juveniles.
   Thursday's shootings resulted from an altercation a week or two
ago between two loosely organized groups of young people, said
Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, but he declined to say what it was
about.
   When asked if the dispute involved drugs, as 40 percent of the
homicides this year have, Fulwood lashed out:
   ``I don't know whether it was drug-related or not, but I doubt
it. Don't make everything drug-related; it cheapens the violence.''
   He blamed easy access to guns, pervasive violence on television,
and a breakdown in values, saying the altercation between the
groups would have been settled in the old days by a simple fist
fight.
   Family breakups and the lack of parents inculcating values in
their children have led to a society that believes ``anything goes
in order to get what I want,'' Fulwood said.
   The chief said he has spoken to young people about shootings and
he has found they show ``no remorse, not the first tear. There's no
sense that there's anything wrong.''
   The attack about 3 p.m. Thursday involved multiple gunshots by
shooters in a car passing by the victims.
   Police arrested three juveniles - one 16 and the other two 14 -
before dawn Friday. Two other 14-year-old suspects were still at
large, Fulwood said.
   No names were released because of their ages, and the chief said
no decision had yet been made on whether to try any as adults.
Three were arraigned Friday in juvenile court.
   All five victims were treated at Children's National Medical
Center. Xaziver Paul, 6, and Troy Gray, 15, were discharged Friday,
spokeswoman Barbara Cire said.
   Brian Lewis, 12, was listed in good condition. John Olden, 13,
and Clarence Richmond, 14, were in fair condition, all improved
after first being termed in serious condition.
   Two children were shot in the chest, two in the abdomen and one
in the arm, said Dr. Marty Eichelberger, director of emergency
trauma services at the hospital.
   ``There are five kids, and there are a lot of holes,''
Eichelberger said.
   Fulwood praised the principal of the junior high school, Dr.
Percy Ellis, and the school staff, saying they were ``pivotal'' in
tracking down the alleged assailants.
   Ellis declined reporters' requests for interviews.
   The shootings didn't come as a complete surprise to police.
   Officers went to the junior high school earlier Thursday when
officials ``heard something was going down,'' said Lt. Reginald
Smith, a police spokesman. Instead, it happened about eight blocks
away, as the victims stood near a picket fence in the Shaw
residential area of northwest Washington.
   Shaw is one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, but it is
expected to experience an economic upturn next year when a subway
station opens.
   Already it's a mixture of low-rise, single-family townhouses -
some of them with small but carefully manicured yards and Christmas
decorations draping the front doors - houses subdivided into
apartments and boarded up buildings. A baseball field is near the
intersection where the shootings occurred. There's a large
playground a block away.
   A 28-year-old man who moved out of the neighborhood five years
ago and returns only to visit his parents said he wasn't surprised
to hear of the shootings.
   ``That's the atmosphere around here,'' said the man, who would
not give his name. ``We're trying to move them out to where we're
living in Maryland,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis couldn't stop clouds from
blocking the sun over historic Boston Common Friday, but he signed
into law a bill to prevent new buildings from shadowing the common
for more than one hour a day.
   ``The good Lord is casting a shadow over us all here, even as I
speak,'' Dukakis said before he signed the bill, standing at the
edge of the park.
   Commons are found in many New England towns. Boston Common was
established in 1634, when the city's first settler, a hermit named
William Blackstone, agreed to sell 45 acres to the town of Boston.
   Boston Common was first used as a pasture for citizens' animals.
Later, it was a training site for the militia and the site of
public hangings.
   Today, the common is a popular tourist attraction. It's located
on Beacon Hill, just below the gold-domed Massachusetts Statehouse.
   Senate President William Bulger, who represents parts of Boston,
sponsored the bill, which he said will give ``a greater protection
for this particular important part of our lives.''
   The new law also applies to the common in the nearby town of
Lynn. The bill's sponsors added Lynn to the measure to bypass a
requirement that the city first approve the measure. Boston Mayor
Raymond Flynn had opposed the bill, but went along with it after it
was amended slightly.
   The lame-duck governor said one thing he will miss in leaving
office next month is looking out on the common from his office
window.
   Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate, did not
seek re-election as governor this year. Republican William Weld was
elected and will be inaugurated on Jan. 3.
   ``I can tell you that there have been many occasions where for a
variety of reasons I have needed a certain amount spiritual
uplifting,'' Dukakis said, ``and there's nothing like walking over
to that window and looking down.''

<TEXT>
   The federal government ran up a $48.1 billion
deficit in November, a 62 percent increase over a year ago, due in
part to the Persian Gulf buildup and a failing economy, the
Treasury Department reported Friday.
   Combined with the October deficit, the imbalance for the first
two months of fiscal 1991 totaled $79.5 billion, up 42.5 percent
from the comparable period of fiscal 1990.
   Economist Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting
firm, said the weakening economy is resulting in declining tax
revenues.
   ``It's really getting to the point where the deficit is starting
to balloon because both personal and corporate taxes are starting
to fall off,'' he said. ``Receipts in November were $6 billion less
than they should have been in a normal economy.''
   The government collected $27.2 billion in individual income
taxes last month, a 21 percent decline from November 1989. At the
same time, corporate income taxes were down 46 percent to $1.3
billion.
   At the same time, defense spending increased 18 percent from a
year ago, to $29 billion, reflecting the military buildup in the
Middle East. And spending on the savings and loan bailout jumped to
$2.8 billion, up 220 percent from the $879 million outlay in
November 1989.
   Overall, receipts totaled $72.8 billion in November, up 2.3
percent from the same month last year. Spending, however, jumped 20
percent, from $100.9 billion in 1989 to $120.9 billion last month.
The deficit is the difference between the two.
   The Bush administration already has conceded the fiscal 1991
deficit will set a new record. Budget director Richard Darman has
projected the imbalance at between $250 billion and $300 billion.
   The Congressional Budget Office, on the other hand, forecasts a
$320 billion gap this year.
   The deficit in fiscal 1990 was $220.4 billion, just shy of the
$221.2 billion record set in 1986.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories were the military,
Social Security and other programs of the Department of Health and
Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $5.1 billion so far this year. It is
projected to total $292.2 billion for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $21.5 billion for the month
and $41.0 billion for the year. They are projected to total $262.2
billion for the year.
   Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$17.8 billion in August and $35.1 billion for 1990 so far. They are
projected to total $210.4 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $21.9 billion for the
month and $40.0 billion so far this year. It is projected to total
$287.0 billion for the entire year.

<HEAD>Romanians Rally on First Anniversary of Revolution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanians rallied on the first
anniversary of the revolution that toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, but the marches were tinged by frustrations over
increasing economic hardships.
   Rallies in Bucharest and Timisoara, the cradle of last year's
revolution, capped a week of protests against Ceausescu's
successors. Romanians are frustrated with the lack of improved
living standards since 1989.
   About 15,000 people gathered in Bucharest's University Square,
chanting slogans against President Ion Iliescu. Another 15,000
workers rallied in Timisoara, 300 miles northwest of the capital.
   The two weeks prior to the revolution's anniversary have been
marked by strikes and protests against the National Salvation Front
government.
   The Front, which took power during the revolution and won
subsequent May elections, faces sliding popularity over its plans
to reform the economy that include raising prices on basic goods.
   ``Illiescu is a liar'' and ``He will fall, down, down, down,''
the Bucharest crowd chanted.
   In an address Friday to Parliament, Iliescu said the government
must press ahead with reforms, despite growing popular opposition.
   ``We must prove we are ready for ... democracy,'' Iliescu said,
adding that 1991 would be ``a decisive year for all our reforms.''
   On University Square, where police shot and killed demonstrators
last Dec. 21, crowds knelt and lighted candles in memory of the
uprising's 1,039 dead.
   After a minute of silence, the anti-government chants continued.
   In Timisoara, protesters also chanted, ``Down with Iliescu'' and
``Down with communism.''
   About 75,000 industrial workers in Timisoara, where the uprising
began Dec. 16, 1989, have been on strike for a week. They rally
daily in the city.
   Other strikes have included more than 100,000 students and
hundreds of professors. A protest by navigators at the Tarom state
airline has paralyzed internal flights and stranded many
international travelers.
   Many Romanians are disillusioned with the results of the
revolution, feeling little has changed in a country plagued by
shortages. Critics also charge that Front leaders - many of them
former Communists - still harbor authoritarian tendencies.
   Echoing the battle cry directed at Ceausescu one year ago, the
crowd in Bucharest chanted ``Timisoara, Timisoara.'' The bloody
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators began the popular unrest
in Bucharest last year.
   ``A year ago the army, police and Securitate (secret police)
made a pact with the devil to bring Iliescu to power,'' said one
speaker at the Bucharest rally.
   The square was ringed with blue police vans but no incidents
were reported.
   The large, open area between Bucharest University and the
National Theater was where last year's revolution took hold of the
capital and protesters died challenging police and the army.
   The next day, hundreds of thousands rallied in the streets of
Bucharest, forcing Ceausescu and his wife Elena to flee. The couple
was captured by the army and summarily tried and executed Dec. 25.
   The square, which is also the capital's central intersection,
has since been the site of repeated anti-government protests, some
ending in violent clashes with police.
   Rally organizers said the demonstration would continue through
the night until Saturday morning but many were disappointed by
Friday's turnout.
   ``We are so few because the government lies to people through
television,'' said one woman. Others blamed the cold, snowy weather
- a sharp contrast to spring-like days that preceded last year's
events.
   At one point, the crowd began chanting ``Long live King
Michael,'' referring to the Hohenzollern monarch, forced to
abdicate by the Communists in 1946. He lives in exile in
Switzerland.
   His daughter, Princess Margarita, who watched Friday's rally
from a balcony of a luxury hotel overlooking the square, said she
thought a restoration of constitutional monarchy in Romania was
``possible.''
   ``The people need a father, they need a figure, a symbol of
unity,'' said Margarita, 40, in Romania on a three-week aid mission
to orphanages and other charities.

<HEAD>Brazil Announces Project to Clean Up Rio's Bay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday announced
a $500 million project to dredge and clean up Rio's picturesque
Guanabara Bay, polluted by years of chemical waste-dumping.
   The federal project, to begin next month, includes the
construction of underground drains, recycling plants and waste
treatment facilities, said Eliana Farias, a spokesman in the Social
Action Ministry.
   Scientists say it will take until the year 2005 to finish the
cleanup.
   The bay, known worldwide for the picture-postcard Sugarloaf
Mountain rising at its mouth, will also be dredged to halt a
50-year erosion of its banks, Farias said by telephone from
Brasilia.
   The cleanup will occur in conjunction with ``Project Rio.'' That
$390 million campaign, financed by the World Bank, is underway to
clean Rio's waterways and beaches and upgrade the city's sanitation
department, Farias said.
   ``The great surprise of next summer will be that we'll actually
have clean beaches and water to enjoy,'' said Rio state Gov.
Wellington Moreira Franco.
   Today, the bay receives an estimated 100 tons of chemical waste
from oil refineries daily. Ocean tides carry some residue out to
sea, but much of it washes up on the shores of Rio's famous
beaches, including Copacabana and Ipanema.
   The environmental effort was planned shortly after Rio was
chosen as the host city of the 1992 U.N. World Environment
Conference. Leaders from more than 100 countries are expected to
attend and discuss issues including climatic changes, ozone
deterioration and rain forest preservation.

   Here are the latest developments in the Persian Gulf crisis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The White House raised doubts Friday that the United States
would attack Ira immediately if it fails to meet next month's
deadline for withdrawing from Kuwait. ``January 15 is not an attack
day at all,'' said Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national
security adviser.
   ---
   In Saudi Arabia, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told troops
that war was closer. ``It increasingly looks like (Saddam's) not
getting the message and we'll have to use force,'' Cheney said.
``The only acceptable outcome, if hostilities begin, is absolute,
total victory.''
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told
the troops that in the event of an attack: ``We will launch it
violently, we will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so
we can get it over as quickly as possible and there's no question
who won.''
   ---
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein predicted victory in any war. He
also stood by his refusal to pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15
deadline.
   ``In the event of war, there will be great losses, not just in
terms of human life. Those who now say yes to war will be
responsible. Allah is on our side, so we will defeat the
aggressors,'' Saddam told Germany's ZDF television network.
   ---
   British Prime Minister John Major said in Washington that Iraqi
troops will have to be ``forcibly removed'' from Kuwait if Saddam
does not agree to withdraw them peacefully. Major said a partial
Iraqi pullback would not be acceptable.
   ---
   A million Iraqis heeded air raid sirens and jammed roads out of
Baghdad in an evacuation drill to test readiness for war.
Residents, clutching blankets and food, jumped into cars or rushed
to special centers where they caught buses to evacuation camps set
up outside the capital.
   ---
   In Germany, the government said it was investigating U.S.
suspicions that German companies are violating a trade embargo
against Iraq. One firm denied giving Iraq sensitive nuclear
know-how and equipment.
   The government confirmed a report that Washington has given it a
list of German companies suspected of violating the U.N. embargo.
   ---
   The U.S. military command said eight American soldiers have been
poisoned by home-brewed alcohol and hospitalized since Sunday.
   The soldiers, from the 101st Airborne Division, are the first
known casualties of home-brewed liquor since U.S. forces were
deployed in Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country that bans all alcohol.

   The Federal Election Commission voted
unanimously to dismiss allegations that pro-Israel lobbying groups
broke election laws by illegally coordinating their activities,
according to documents released Friday.
   The commission said its six members ``find no reason to
believe'' the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)
violated lobbying rules in connection with 27 political action
committees around the country.
   The vote was taken last year but was kept secret because an
unrelated complaint involving AIPAC and other organizations is
still pending, said commission spokesman Fred Eiland.
   The agency disclosed its findings only after lengthy arguments
with the complainants, who requested publication of the material
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The complaint, filed Jan. 12, 1989, was brought by several
former U.S. officials who have long argued that AIPAC exercises
undue influence on Congress and skews U.S. foreign policy in
Israel's favor.
   They accused AIPAC of failing to disclose what they said was its
coordination of the 27 other PACs.
   In the undecided case, the same plaintiffs contended AIPAC
should have registered as a political action committee because,
they said, it targeted political candidates for election or defeat
based on their position toward Israel. This case involves the
alleged use of a ``black book'' containing vital information on
every Senate and House race.
   AIPAC responded that such activities were internal
communications with its 55,000 members and protected by Supreme
Court rulings.
   In the case that it decided, the FEC said there was not enough
evidence to show that AIPAC and the other pro-Israel committees
were affiliated.
   Although the 27 PACs received information regarding
congressional races, ``it appears that each respondent PAC makes
independent decisions regarding which candidates to support,'' the
commission said.
   The plaintiffs demanded that AIPAC be forced to register as a
public action committee and disclose its activities - a move that
would have hampered behind-the-scenes lobbying with Congress and
the administration.
   Among the plaintiffs were: one-time ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
James E. Akins; Paul Findley, who says he lost his seat in Congress
in 1982 because of an AIPAC campaign, and George Ball, who served
as undersecretary of state in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations.
   The complaint relied on large measure on news reports about the
activities of the lobbying group, in addition to two internal AIPAC
memoranda.
   AIPAC's 125-page response, accompanied by hundreds of pages of
exhibits, said, ``No one directs American Jews to become active in
liberal organizations or conservative organizations, or in
political campaigns, or to give to candidates or to form political
organizations of their own.''
   The FEC found that the similar pattern of political
contributions by the 27 PACs resulted from their focus on
candidates who support Israel and did not reflect collusion between
them and AIPAC.

   Saddam Hussein said in an interview broadcast
Friday that U.S. forces would not be able to sustain a prolonged
war with Iraq and President Bush would be forced to order a retreat
after American casualties mounted to 5,000.
   Saddam, in the interview on Germany's ZDF television network,
refused again to pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline set by
the United Nations for avoiding force.
   But the Iraqi leader also claimed to be interested in holding
talks with the U.S. government.
   ``From our side, the door for a dialogue still remains open,''
said the Iraqi president. ``We are for a dialogue. Without it,
there is no understanding.''
   ZDF broadcast the interview Friday evening, saying it had been
conducted in Baghdad the day before.
   ``In the event of war, there will be great losses, not just in
terms of human life. Those who now say `yes' to war will be
responsible,'' Saddam said. ``Allah is on our side, so we will
defeat the aggressors.''
   The Iraqi leader made his comments in Arabic and they were
translated into German by the television network. The Associated
Press in turn translated the remarks into English.
   ``When 5,000 Americans have fallen, (President) Bush will have
to end such a war, not because they (the troops) are bad, but
because he is a bad leader,'' said Saddam. ``He is sending the
soldiers to their death without reason.''
   Asked whether he would pull his troops out of Kuwait by the Jan.
15 deadline set by the United Nations, the Iraqi chief answered
``no.''
   ``We are certain that even when Bush pushes his country into
war, which he plans, he can't keep it going,'' Saddam said.
   He accused the U.S. government of aiming to conquer the holy
places of Islam by sending troops to the desert of Saudi Arabia,
and said Bush was failing to try to solve the true problems of the
region.
   ``So, we say to Bush, `leave our country,''' Saddam said. ``If
there are problems among the Arabs, they can solve them the best by
themselves.''
   Asked whether a war with the United States and the rest of the
multinational force would mean ``suicide'' for his country, Saddam
responded: ``We are Moslems and don't believe in suicide.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday in Saudi Arabia that
war with Iraq was increasingly likely. ``Absolute, total victory''
is the only option if war breaks out, he said.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare mood, Southern Californians
praised a freeway instead of cursing it, as the ``granddaddy of
freeways'' celebrated its 50th birthday Friday.
   Though the 8.2-mile Pasadena Freeway, the first in the West,
looks like a museum piece, the sunken six-lane freeway is among the
state's safest, despite thrill-ride curves and floor-it,
sudden-stop ramps.
   The first five-mile section of the freeway opened Dec. 30, 1940.
In a small park beside one especially harrowing curve, the
California Department of Transportation celebrated the anniversary
with a sign denoting the span's significance.
   Almost predictably, the celebration's marching band caused some
passing motorists to swerve in the narrow-gauge lanes.
   Joining the festivities were descendants of construction crew
members and the Gabrielino Indians who transferred the land to the
state in a 1940 ceremony, public officials and the University of
Southern California Marching Band.
   Sally Stanton Rubsamen, the 1940 Rose Queen who dedicated the
ribbon of concrete a half-century ago, recalled trips to school
using successively longer parts of the newly completed surface.
   ``It was a free-way then,'' she said.
   Adding that she now commutes daily from Pasadena to Los Angeles,
Rubsamen said: ``The lanes are a bit narrow, it's a little curvy,
it's beautiful, but some of the on ramps and off ramps are
atrocious.''
   Nearly 130,000 cars a day roll over the Pasadena Freeway, which
meanders from downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena through the Arroyo
Seco. The dry gulch was surveyed, but not used, for a road in 1895.
When first proposed, the freeway's promise was Pasadena to downtown
in 10 minutes. Some trips now take more than an hour.
   Although roads called parkways were already built in the East,
and the autobahn was about to cross Germany, no one new what to
call what was then billed as ``the cutting edge of transportation
development.''
   ``Stopless Motorway'' was one suggestion.
   It was built in 33 months at a cost of $1 million-plus a mile.
Freeways today cost $100 million per mile. It was originally
designed for travel at 45 mph; without traffic, some commuters whip
around its curves at 70.
   ``It was the new thing in transportation engineering,'' said
Alfred Himelhoch, an engineer on the project. ``We didn't know too
much about it because we were on the cutting edge.''
   Himelhoch, who has since worked on nearly every freeway in the
Los Angeles area, recalled the trepidation of starting work on the
new project.
   ``It's scary to work on any freeway,'' he said.
   Public reaction to the project was not divided by the protests
surrounding modern freeway construction, he added. ``It was a new
venture and people didn't know as much about a freeway. The
discussion as to merit and impact on the community came later.''
   Himelhoch said each lane is 10 or 11 feet wide, falling short of
today's 12-foot standard. Motorists sometimes have 10 feet to
accelerate to 55 miles per hour, and some exits require cars to
slow to 5 mph while still in the slow lane.
   But Himelhoch said safety was the main goal of any freeway, more
important than moving people.
   ``Freeways are three times as safe as surface roads because of
the divider between directions and the ramps which bring cars
smoothly onto them,'' he said.
   The Pasadena Freeway's safety rate is 1.84 reportable accidents
for every million vehicle miles traveled, one of California's best,
state officials said.
   The Los Angeles freeway system contains 4 percent of the surface
area of California's roads, but carries more than 40 percent of the
state's traffic.
   Though celebrating the route that paved the way for 4,047 miles
of future freeways, officials Friday hinted at the end of the
freeway age.
   ``Fifty years ago this magnificent and ambitious project was the
answer to the transit needs of a growing and increasingly mobile
population,'' said state Sen. Art Torres. ``But today our needs are
drastically increased, and the demands of the environment must
force us to look beyond.''
   Torres advocated a light rail system and a proposed monorail
that would run 58 miles along the Los Angeles River to Long Beach.
   ``Perhaps more freeways are not the answer,'' Torres said.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
civil fraud charges Friday against the bankrupt Latin Investment
Corp., an uninsured storefront ``bank'' whose collapse threw more
than $6.8 million in deposits into jeopardy.
   The SEC lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, also
sought a court order freezing the assets of three top officers of
Latin Investment Corp., which catered primarily to Latin American
immigrants.
   The Washington-based corporation's assets were frozen Dec. 15
when it was forced into involuntary bankruptcy.
   The SEC said it had contacted the government of El Salvador to
locate any assets there that would be subject to a freeze order.
   Also named in the lawsuit were: LIC founder Fernando Leonzo of
Vienna, Va.; the corporation's secretary, Leonel Salinas of Falls
Church, Va.; and vice president Jose A. Cortes of Arlington, Va.
   The three men also sit on the board of El Latino, a weekly
Hispanic newspaper and LIC subsidiary.
   The SEC's civil complaint was filed just three days after Leonzo
invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination and
refused to answer questions under oath, according to documents
filed by the agency.
   ``Many of the investors put much of their life savings in LIC,
relying on materially false and misleading representations of LIC,
Leonzo, Salinas and Cortes,'' the complaint charged.
   According to the complaint, LIC - founded in 1982 - had about
3,500 investors who had placed about $6.8 million with the
investment company as of August 1990.
   But the Wilson International Center, a private community group
that is helping victims of LIC's collapse, said the amount in
jeopardy was more like $13 million in deposits - an average of more
than $3,700 apiece.
   The SEC lawsuit sought a court order requiring full restitution
to investors who were defrauded.
   The lawsuit also sought a restraining order to keep the three
officers from destroying any documents or transferring assets.
   The complaint alleges that LIC, which operated without a bank
charter or government banking insurance, misled investors into
thinking their funds would be safe and available on demand.
   The SEC also alleged that the three officers did not disclose to
investors that they received more than $500,000 in loans, some of
which was used to pay for their homes, from the investment company.
   As of August, none of those loans had been repaid, the SEC said.
   Leonzo, through his lawyer Charles Pearson, denied the SEC
allegations.
   ``We have a different version of events, and that will certainly
come forward in due time,'' Pearson said. ``We're not trying to
hide anything. What we're trying to do is repay depositors.''
   Last week, a federal bankruptcy judge ordered - without
opposition from Leonzo - that the company be liquidated.

   Ranchers broke up ice in cattle troughs and
workers stayed busy repairing brittle rail, telephone and plumbing
lines as record low temperatures gripped northern and central
Nevada on Friday.
   The Arctic storm that chilled Western states most of the week
pushed temperatures in Reno to minus 7, snapping a 22-year record
of 3 degrees below zero.
   ``Pretty near froze to death out there this morning,'' said Bob
Wallis, who works at the Blue Diamond Ranch in Eureka, where
Friday's low plunged to minus 12 degrees.
   Even after 40 years of range roaming, ``you never get used to
that,'' Wallis said.
   Wallis said that despite the cold, the cowboys at the 6,000-head
ranch were checking the cattle's health each day.
   ``They get pneumonia and stuff when it gets this cold, and we go
out and doctor them,'' he said. ``That's all I do is doctor.''
   Others were keeping the herd stocked with fodder and breaking up
icebergs that formed in water troughs, he said.
   In Reno, even thick-furred Malamute dogs balked at going
outside.
   Plumbers reported a brisk business.
   ``We're all booked up,'' said a dispatcher at ABC Plumbing.
``The phones started ringing at 4 a.m., and we're still getting
them.''
   While plumbers scrounged around in flooded basements, the cold
slowed down telephone workers installing lines for special
teen-ager gab phones that parents had ordered for Christmas.
   ``Being as cold as it is, nothing works,'' said Kelly Sanford of
Nevada Bell. ``Everything is just nearly frozen. Your nose freezes,
your cheeks freeze, your glasses fog up.
   ``But actually, it is invigorating,'' she said. ``It's so brisk,
you're above the rooftops, you see the city, the mountains.''
   Worker Terri Martinez said sales was ``not good at all'' at the
Ice Cream Factory in Ely, where a 26-degree-below-zero reading
shattered the record of minus 13 degrees set in 1968.
   ``They haven't been for almost two months. That's why we're
closing Saturday until March,'' Ms. Martinez said.
   Mary Ann Brown, spokeswoman for Southern Pacific Railroad, said
the cold was more of a nuisance than a major headache.
   ``We're having a little bit of a problem with broken rail in a
few spots, but nothing major,'' Ms. Brown said. ``It's common when
the weather's so cold like this.''
   But was it really too cold for Malamutes?
   Not according to Dr. Debbie Brigmon, a veterinarian in
Anchorage, Alaska.
   ``Well, let's just say that up north it gets 70 below, and there
are dogs that live year round outside in that,'' she said.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said Friday a U.S. attack against Iraqi forces is growing
increasingly likely. He promised cheering troops they won't sit
indefinitely in the desert and ``absolute, total victory'' is the
only option if war begins.
   Joining Cheney in hawkish pep rallies with troops in the
northeast Saudi desert was Gen. Colin Powell, the Joint Chiefs of
Staff chairman, who said he still hoped for resolution of the
Persian Gulf crisis without war but then drew roars of applause
when he pledged:
   ``When we launch it, we will launch it violently; we will launch
it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get it over as
quickly as possible and there's no question who won.''
   Cheney said he was not optimistic Washington and Iraq would hold
top-level talks on the crisis, let alone resolve it, by the Jan. 15
U.N. deadline for Saddam Hussein to withdraw his army from Kuwait.
   President Bush has threatened to attack if that deadline isn't
met, and the two sides have been unable to agree on dates for talks
in Baghdad and Washington.
   ``It increasingly looks like he's not getting the message and
we'll have to use force,'' Cheney said of Saddam.
   In Washington, meanwhile, National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft said that Jan. 15 ``is not an attack day at all'' but a
warning to Saddam that after that date ``he is at risk.''
   ``One of the important points we're trying to get across to him
is that we haven't blinked so far, we're not blinking now and we
will not blink,'' Scowcroft said in an interview with The
Associated Press and reporters from other news agencies.
   Cheney and Powell, fresh from three days of strategy sessions
with field commanders in Saudi Arabia, were asked by troops whether
American ground forces would be ready to fight by the Jan. 15 U.N.
deadline for Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The troops apparently were well aware of the controversy stirred
by the deputy commander of Operation Desert Shield, Lt. Gen. Calvin
A.H. Waller, who said Wednesday that still-arriving ground troops
might not be combat ready until well into February.
   Asked by an airman how long the United States would wait to
attack if the deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, Cheney
said:
   ``While I can't tell you a specific date, for obvious reasons,
when that would happen, I can say that we are eager to get this
wrapped up as quickly as possible. ... We do not think that waiting
indefinitely is going to solve the problem and I'm confident we'll
move as soon as we can to wrap it up.''
   But he did not say when he believed American forces would be
ready for such an attack.
   Powell said at one point, ``I think we're ready now,'' only to
say seconds later that some forces were still arriving and would
not be combat ready for some time.
   At their first two stops at a sprawling installation that
includes huge Air Force and Army camps, Cheney promised the troops
that if fighting begins, ``there will be the freedom and
flexibility to run a first-class military operation all the way.''
In an apparent reference to Vietnam, he said U.S. forces ``won't
have their hands tied behind their backs. There won't be
sanctuaries where the enemy can take cover.''
   The troops applauded.
   Cheney and Powell also offered Christmas greetings and promised
the troops they had the support of Bush and the American public.
But they spent most of their time talking tough.
   ``The only acceptable outcome, if hostilities begin, is
absolute, total victory,'' Cheney said.
   Powell added, ``When we go in, we go in to win, not fool
around.''
   Asked how the United States would respond if Saddam used
chemical weapons, Cheney said Bush would have at his disposal ``a
full spectrum of capabilities. ... The response of the United
States will be overwhelming and devastating.''
   Virtually all of the troops at the appearances - even some out
of uniform in shorts and T-shirts - had gas masks strapped to their
waists.
   Cheney and Powell had been scheduled to split up and fly by
helicopter to Army and Marine camps, respectively. But strong,
swirling winds grounded the helicopters so the plans were altered.
   Most of the troops seemed happy to see their bosses, although
Cheney and Powell faced complaints about the uncertainty of the
deployment length and the loss of extra food allowances paid to
troops who live off base in the United States.
   At the first stop, Airman R. L. Miller said he wanted the crisis
resolved immediately.
   ``There are two ways to go - north or home,'' he said.

   The government said Friday it is
investigating U.S. suspicions that German companies have broken
U.N. sanctions against Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait. One German
firm denied the allegations.
   Washington has given Bonn a list of 50 German companies
suspected of violating the embargo against Iraq, the news magazine
Der Spiegel said.
   The magazine said the information came from U.S. wiretaps of
``Iraq's overall telephone traffic and intercepting Telefax
messages.'' It did not identify its sources.
   The Bonn government confirmed it received a list of suspected
embargo violators and that the allegations were being examined.
   But government spokesman Dieter Vogel said so far no proof had
emerged that any of the companies made deliveries in violation of
U.N. sanctions.
   ``It's turned out the list at least partially concerns mistaken
information,'' said Vogel, who did not elaborate.
   The Economics Ministry spokesman, Dieter Franzen, said the
government was ``in closest contact (with the U.S. embassy) and are
trying to pursue even the slightest suspicion.''
   Der Spiegel reported that U.S. officials suspect one German
firm, Interatom, of supplying Iraq with ``highly sensitive''
nuclear training and equipment.
   The magazine said two other German firms, which it did not
identify, are believed to have helped Iraq with nerve gas
production.
   Interatom and its owner, the giant electronics conglomerate,
Siemens, angrily denied the magazine's report.
   ``Der Spiegel's claims are simply false,'' said Interatom
spokesman Herbert Mayer from the company's office in Bergisch
Gladbach near Cologne.
   Siemens said in a news release that Interatom had signed a
contract to help Iraq build a processing plant for industrial
piping but the business had nothing to do with nuclear technology.
The contract involved only ``generally accessible engineering
knowledge,'' the release said.
   ``We're not crazy. We don't deliver things that don't correspond
with the political interests of the West,'' said Mayer.
   He said the program later was suspended after Interatom
``received an indication from the (German) government which urged
extreme caution because Iraq was looking for military technology.''
   Interatom specializes in atomic energy plan construction and
uranium enrichment, but is also involved in non-nuclear
engineering.
   Mayer also said Interatom had workers in Iraq when Saddam
Hussein's forces took over Kuwait on Aug. 2. He said the Interatom
workers were trapped in Iraq and the last one returned on Dec. 15.

<TEXT>
   Clarence L. ``Kelly'' Johnson, creator of
Lockheed Corp.'s secret ``Skunk Works'' that created America's
first production jet fighter and a generation of spyplanes, died
Friday. He was 80.
   Johnson, who led the design of the U-2, the SR-71 Blackbird and
more than 40 other airplanes and spacecraft, died at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank after a long illness, Lockheed said. The
illness was not disclosed.
   Using titanium and sleek shapes, Johnson's designs broke the
``thermal thicket,'' the high-heat problem of supersonic flight,
said Donald Lopez, a senior advisor at the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   Use of titanium alloy on the SR-71 rather than standard aluminum
made flight at high speed possible despite 800-degree Fahrenheit
temperatures. The Blackbird flies at more than 2,000 mph and above
85,000 feet.
   ``The skin would glow sometimes,'' Lopez said of the Blackbirds,
recently retired by the Air Force. ``Pilots could feel the heat
coming in.''
   Johnson organized the Skunk Works in Burbank in 1943 to build
the XP-80 Shooting Star, the United States' first production jet
fighter.
   Many designs bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning in World War II,
the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V
antisubmarine patrol aircraft, the Agena spacecraft, and the F-104
Starfighter, the first production aircraft to fly at twice the
speed of sound.
   The U-2 was the first plane able to make a sustained flight
above 60,000 feet, and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird remain the
fastest and highest-flying planes in the world. The Blackbird's
maximum speed and altitude remain classified.
   The Air and Space Museum saluted Johnson in its gallery of
pioneers.
   Born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson was the
seventh of nine children of Swedish immigrant parents. From his
father, a carpenter and bricklayer, Johnson developed a respect for
tools. According to Lockheed, he knew by the time he was 12 that he
wanted to build airplanes.
   He studied aeronautical engineering at the University of
Michigan, and worked as a consultant on the aerodynamic design of
cars that were to run in the Indianapolis 500.
   He went to work for Lockheed the same year he received his
master's degree, 1933. He went on to head the Skunk Works for 30
years.
   The secrecy of the Skunk Works is so great that even the origin
of the name is shrouded in mystery, although it apparently was
derived from Al Capp's cartoon strip, ``Li'l Abner,'' which
featured a moonshine distillery called the Skonk Works.
   Johnson retired as a senior vice president in 1975 and retired
from Lockheed's board of directors in 1980.
   Tony LeVier, the Skunk Works' former chief test pilot, described
Johnson as a stern father figure with a direct line to the
Pentagon.
   And his planes, LeVier said, ``flew like a dream.''
   ``My God,'' he said. ``They were advanced.''
   Johnson is survived by his wife Nancy, a brother and a sister.

<HEAD>Army, Navy Record Best-Ever Safety Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Army and the Navy said Friday the past
year was their safest on record. Private vehicle accidents remained
the biggest killer of soldiers and sailors.
   The Army said 353 servicemen and women were killed in accidents
during the budget year ended Sept. 30, including those that
occurred off-base and off-duty.
   The time period included the first rush of troops to the Persian
Gulf.
   More than two-thirds of the deaths were from private automobile
accidents. In the comparable period a year earlier, the Army had
369 accidental deaths.
   There were 732,000 Army personnel on active duty at the end of
accounting period.
   Total Army accidents were down by 1,348 from the previous year,
to 8,647, and deaths from aviation accidents fell from 35 to 33.
   Col. Steven Raho, deputy director of Army safety, attributed the
safety improvement to a variety of factors, including increased
effort by the Army to design safety features into new equipment
rather than adding the features after production.
   The Navy, which had 579,000 personnel on active duty at the end
of the budget year, said it recorded 255 total deaths from
accidents, including 206 not related to Navy operations. That was
down from 339 total Navy deaths the year before, of which 47
occurred in the April 19, 1989 explosion aboard the battleship USS
Iowa.
   Two-thirds of total Navy accidental deaths were from private
vehicle wrecks.
   The Navy had 39 deaths from aviation accidents, including those
involving Marine Corps aircraft. The Navy total of 30 deaths from
aviation was the lowest on record, as was the Marine Corps total of
nine.
   The Marines do not publish lists of accidents from ground
activities, and the Air Force said it was not yet prepared to
release its statistics on fiscal 1990 accidents and deaths.

   Lithuanian lawmakers demanded an end to Soviet
army patrols in the Baltic port of Klaipeda, and the city's mayor
labeled the military action a ``gross interference'' to civilian
life, Tass reported Friday.
   Col. Ivan Chernykh, commander of the Klaipeda garrison, told
Lithuanian authorities that armed units would have the authority to
check people's documents and make arrests, the official Soviet news
agency said. The patrols began Thursday.
   They were ordered following clashes between civilians and Soviet
soldiers and sailors in Klaipeda, which has a large military
presence, according to an editor with the independent Elta news
agency.
   Tass quoted Chernykh as saying soldiers with submachine guns
were patrolling the streets in cars.
   The Lithuanian Supreme Council, or parliament, sent a note to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to protest the patrols, and the
lawmakers demanded their removal and that officers involved be
punished.
   ``This order is a flagrant violation of the laws and the rights
of citizens of the republic of Lithuania, as well as a political
provocation with the intent to heighten tensions and to create
potential conflicts,'' said a copy of the note distributed to
Western news agencies.
   The note asked Gorbachev to ``revoke the mentioned directives of
the Soviet army authorities and to punish them for their willful
behavior which is accompanied by the threat of armed violence.''
   The parliament also asked Lithuanians to remain calm and not to
get involved in conflicts with the patrols.
   Vytautas Cepas, the mayor of the city of 200,000 people, told
Tass the imposition of this ``special regime'' was nothing but an
open provocation and ``gross interference in the purely civilian
life of the city.''
   Chernykh said the patrols were justified.
   ``Hooligan actions, insults to servicemen and the attempts to
penetrate the territory around the monument to Lenin, guarded by
soldiers, take place every day,'' he told Tass.
   Lithuania said the orders issued by the Soviet military were not
valid on the territory of the republic. Lithuania and the other
Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia have declared independence
from the Soviet Union.
   In Latvia on Friday, about 500 representatives of the Soviet
army from the three Baltic republics and the neighboring
Kaliningrad region of Russia appealed to the Congress of People's
Deputies in Moscow to introduce presidential rule in the country,
Latvian radio reported.
   Constitutional amendments adoped in March say the president can
decare a state of emergency ``in the interest of providing
citizens' security.'' Under presidential rule, local governments
could be disbanded.
   The army representatives warned the Baltic republics that any
attempt to cut off power, water or heat to military installations
would result in the seizure of the facilities by the armed forces,
Tass reported from Riga, the Latvian capital.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new 4th graf with General Dynamics shakeup of A-12

<TEXT>
   Navy officials, hoping to overcome a wave of
damaging revelations about its A-12 stealth attack plane, launched
a public campaign Friday to rescue the $50 billion program.
   Navy officials went public with arguments for continuing the
development program, which is classified secret, just two weeks
before Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's target date for deciding
whether to cancel it.
   In a move that underscored the economic stakes involved, the
companies holding a $4.8 billion contract to build the first A-12
prototypes - General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. -
announced Thursday they were notifying about 8,000 workers that
they could lose their jobs if the project is killed.
   And on Friday General Dynamics announced a shakeup of its A-12
management. It reassigned the A-12 program director, Charles
Anderson. His replacement is Ted Webb, the former head of the
successful F-16 fighter jet program, who retired last year.
   The contractors were ordered by the Navy last week to correct
the project's flaws by Jan. 2 or face the possibility of being held
in default of the contract terms. The Navy cited a failure to
supply parts on time for final assembly of the prototypes, and it
questioned whether the A-12 design was suitable.
   Cheney has given the Navy until Jan. 4 to ``show cause'' why he
shouldn't terminate the entire project, whose schedule delays and
cost overruns he called ``intolerable.'' Cheney nonetheless said he
remains convinced that a new carrier-based attack plane with
radar-evading capabilities is urgently needed.
   The Navy calls the A-12 its top priority in weapons development.
The aircraft, dubbed the Avenger after the World War II fighter, is
supposed to replace the A-6 Intruder, a carrier-based attack plane
that the Navy says is growing obsolete.
   Capt. Mike Currie, who is responsible for ensuring that the A-12
now on the drawing boards is produced according to the Navy's
specifications, told the Association of Naval Aviation on Friday
that the plane is vital to U.S. security interests.
   ``It's not a matter of wanting a new gee-whiz airplane,'' he
said. ``We just need more airplanes.''
   Vice Adm. R.M. Dunleavy, the Navy's air warfare chief,
introduced Currie's presentation to the aviator's group by telling
the friendly audience ``The future of naval aviation is at a
crossroads. We need the A-12 - you've got to believe that.''
   Neither Dunleavy nor Currie would comment on the economic and
other controversies surrounding the A-12, including the recent
firing of the Navy admiral in charge of the program and the
disclosure that the program is the focus of a criminal
investigation.
   Currie said in an interview on Thursday that the Navy was eager
to publicly build a case for continuing the A-12 project, which
already is at least $1 billion over budget and 18 months behind
schedule. There also are questions about whether the contractors
can build the aircraft to Navy specifications.
   A key technical problem is limiting the weight of the aircraft
while making it sturdy enough to withstand the pressures of
landings on aircraft carriers.
   Currie said the A-6 lacks the speed, maneuverability and
radar-evading technologies to survive against the ``projected
threat,'' a euphemism for the Pentagon's secret forecast of how
effective future Soviet air defenses may be.
   He said 90 A-6s are deployed in the Persian Gulf area as part of
Operation Desert Shield.
   Computer models show that the A-12 is the best - though also the
most expensive - of several possible successors to the A-6, Currie
said. It also is the only one under active development.
   ``Of course airplanes are always better on paper,'' he said,
adding ``I'll believe it when I see it.''

<TEXT>
   A Cambodian peace plan giving the United Nations a
strong role in an interim government was examined by the nation's
four warring factions Friday. One official warned time was running
out to settle the conflict.
   ``The world has changed. Other priorities can and will require
our attention,'' said French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. ``The
international community cannot indefinitely work out the fate of
Cambodia if Cambodians themselves do not have the political will to
do so.''
   But Dumas said he was encouraged that no one issued an outright
rejection of the proposal. The meeting of the 12-member Supreme
National Council of Cambodia was expected to continue Saturday,
said Dumas, who urged acceptance of the U.N. plan.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen collapsed during the talks,
apparently from fatigue, and was hospitalized. He was reported in
satisfactory condition Friday.
   The council, meeting for the second time since its creation
three months ago, is composed of six representatives of Hun Sen's
Vietnamese-backed government and two from each of the three
factions in the resistance coalition, which includes the Khmer
Rouge.
   The other factions are those of resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, represented in Paris by his son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, and another non-Communist grouping headed by Son Sann.
   Dumas said the peace plan, agreed to Nov. 26 by the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, was a compromise
text that could be improved but not ``put into question.''
   The International Conference on Peace in Cambodia adjourned in
September 1989 after a monthlong effort failed to reach a
settlement.
   The Khmer Rouge was toppled from power by a Vietnamese invasion
in December 1978. Khmer Rouge guerrillas, aided by China, have
since waged a war against the government of Hun Sen, joined by the
smaller armies of Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   In his opening remarks, Dumas tried to ease criticism that the
proposal gives the United Nations too great a role in running the
country.
   The plan calls for the United Nations to administer Cambodia
during an interim period leading to free elections, while the
supreme council acts as titular head.
   Hun Sen has already said the plan exceeds the authority of the
U.N. charter.
   He also said that ``serious measures must be taken to suppress
the foundations'' of the communist Khmer Rouge, the strongest
member of the three-party resistance coalition.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan, a member of the Supreme
National Council, was among those seated at the negotiating table
Friday.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the questions posed
by the council members Friday related mainly to the relationship
between the council and the United Nations during the interim
period, various aspects of a cease-fire and withdrawal and the
elections.
   The special U.N. representative, Raffeudin Ahmed, also present
at the meeting, will add points raised at the Paris meeting to the
final U.N. proposal, Dumas said.
   Dumas acknowledged the U.N. representative would have strong
powers, but said ``it is in no case a real tutelage as long as the
Supreme National Council embodies the sovereignty of Cambodia.''
   However, unresolved quarrels among the four Cambodian factions
made it ``indispensable'' to give the U.N. final decision-making
power ``to avoid paralysis of the process leading to elections,''
he said.
   It was not immediately clear whether progress had been made to
resolve a dispute over the leadership of the council.
   At its only other meeting, in September in Bangkok, the council
broke up in a dispute over its composition. Hun Sen objected to the
bid by Sihanouk to be president of the council.
   Sihanouk, who supports the Khmer Rouge, said recently he wanted
to be ``neither president, nor member'' of the supreme council.

<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday began
dismantling the cult of Josef Stalin, ordering all statues and
symbols bearing his name removed. It also reportedly gave
permission for the first legal opposition rally.
   The decision to excise Stalin from public life came on what
would have been the Soviet dictator's 111th birthday. Authorities
also ordered the renaming of all streets, institutions and even a
city named after Stalin.
   Albania became the last Eastern European state to reject the
symbols of Stalinism. The Communist leadership made the decision
``taking into consideration that historic circumstances have
changed,'' the state news agency ATA said.
   Before the order was issued Friday, workers already had removed
the imposing bronze statue of the dictator that had stared down at
Tirana residents since before his death in 1953.
   Clusters of Tirana residents watched all morning as workers
finished the job, dismantling the marble-covered pedestal from its
place in a central park. Another giant statue was toppled at a
textile works in Tirana overnight.
   Friday's decison, announced by ATA, called for the renaming of
Qyteti Stalin, the last city in Europe named after Stalin.
   Also Friday, the Albanian leadership gave its permission for a
rally by the new opposition Democratic Party on Saturday, according
to opposition sources. It would be the first legal opposiiton rally
in Albania since the Communists took power in 1944.
   Several thousand students rallied in Tirana last week to demand
democratic change and to hail the founding of the first
non-Communist party. Police did not intervene.
   The significance of Stalin's demise was not lost on Albanians,
who were repressed for decades by the iron-fisted rule of Enver
Hoxha, the Albanian Communist who adored Stalin.
   The change ``should have happened a long time ago,'' said an
Albanian journalist on condition of anonymity.
   It is not clear, however, just how far Albanian leaders are
willing to go toward creating a true democracy.
   Albania's nascent opposition has encountered numerous obstacles,
most of all the ruling party. Opposition leaders say local
Communist officials still hinder party activists travelling to
provincial cities.
   There is also entrenched support for the Communists in the
media, with few details on the newly recognized Democratic Party
appearing in news reports.
   And the ruling Communists are playing tough, cracking down on
riots in four cities last week with a massive show of army and
police force and handing out tough sentences of up to 20 years to
those arrested.
   Tirana was the last capital in Europe to boast a monument to the
Soviet dictator, whose personality cult led to the murder of
millions on the continent.
   ``Now let's take down the statue of the dictator who ruled here
for 50 years,'' said one bold youth watching the workers Friday.
   He was referring to a giant statue of Hoxha that dominates the
nearby central square.
   Dismantling Hoxha's legacy will prove complicated. Although he
has been held responsible for cruel repression in the 1950s and the
isolationist policy that has brought Albania's economy close to
collapse, Hoxha achieved national unity and independence for
virtually the first time in the Balkan nation's turbulent history.
   His name is emblazoned on buildings, streets, and memorials
throughout Albania and his books and portraits adorn every
institution.
   Yet President Ramiz Alia, who took over after Hoxha died in
1985, appears to be pushing his reforms through despite the
presence of hard-liners in the secretive ruling elite.
   The end of Stalin's cult came one day after Hoxha's 71-year-old
widow, Nexhmije Hoxha, lost her last political post as head of the
Communist-led Democratic Front, officially retiring because of old
age.
   She was replaced by Premier Adil Carcani, who is in his late
60s. Rumors persist that Carcani will step down soon as head of
government.
   The Communists promised a government change when they bowed
earlier this month to demands for more democracy, but so far no
changes have been announced.
   A party conference Dec. 26 is expected to give some indication
of the party's new policies. It is supposed to decide a program for
elections scheduled for Feb. 10, in which the Communists will face
opposition for the first time since taking power in 1944.
   The newly founded Democratic Party is pushing for postponement
of the elections, arguing it has insufficient time to organize.
   To date, the media have reported no details of the new party's
program. The party is also negotiating with the government to
publish its own daily newspaper.

Inquirer's Dec. 12 editorial that sparked controversy within the
newspaper's staff:
   Two stories from yesterday's newspaper:
   -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves Norplant, a
contraceptive that can keep a woman from getting pregnant for five
years.
   -A black research organization reports that nearly half the
nation's black children are living in poverty - and that the
younger the child, the more likely he or she is to be living with a
single mother on welfare. ``Growing numbers of them will not
succeed,'' the study's author says.
   As we read those two stories, we asked ourselves: Dare we
mention them in the same breath? To do so might be considered
deplorably insensitive, perhaps raising the specter of eugenics.
But it would be worse to avoid drawing the logical conclusion that
foolproof contraception could be invaluable in breaking the cycle
of inner city poverty - one of America's greatest challenges.
   The main reason more black children are living in poverty is
that the people having the most children are the ones least capable
of supporting them. (The black middle class is growing, but its
birth rate is very low.) This trend, as Children's Defense Fund
president Marian Wright Edelman has said, ``practically guarantees
the poverty of the next generation of black children.''
   Now there are many ways to fight back - from better prenatal
care to better schools. But it's very tough to undo the damage of
being born into a dysfunctional family. So why not make a major
effort to reduce the number of children, of any race, born into
such circumstances? (More hites than blacks live in poverty,
though poor blacks make up a higher percentage of people who are
more or less permanently on welfare.)
   No one should be compelled to use Norplant, which involves a
doctor implanting matchstick-size capsules in a woman's upper arm.
But there could be incentives to do so. What if welfare mothers
were offered an increased benefit for agreeing to use this new,
safe, long-term contraceptive? Remember, these women already have
one or more children. And they can change their minds at any point
and become fertile again. (This is not Indira Ghandi offering
portable radios to women who agree to be sterilized.) At the very
minimum, Norplant, which will probably cost $600 to $1,000, should
be made available for free to poor women.
   All right, the subject makes us uncomfortable, too. But we're
made even more uncomfortable by the impoverishment of black America
and its effect on the nation's future. Think about it.

   Cuban President Fidel Castro said a possible
Persian Gulf war and continued Soviet troubles threaten to sever
the nation's oil supplies, the official news agency Prensa Latin
reported from Havana on Friday.
   Castro also warned more stringent fuel conservation measure
could be necessary.
   Cuba, he said, ``should be prepared for greater limitations than
those of the present, including the possibility of zero fuel
supplies in the worst-case scenario,'' Prensa Latina reported.
   Due to reduced supplies of cut-rate oil from the Soviet Union,
Cuba has implemented a 10 percent energy-savings plan to prevent
blackouts, but new austerity measures might be needed to avoid
electricity failures, Castro said.
   Castro predicted crude oil could go as high as $80 a barrel if
war breaks out in the gulf.
   ``The situation for more than 100 countries would be
catastrophic, because they are poor countries indebted to the
limits of tolerance,'' Castro said in an address to more than 500
university students from Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
   ``These are uncertain times, and not only for Cuba, but for a
large part of the world,'' Castro said.
   The Soviet Union, with its own economic problems, has threatened
phased reduction of overall economic assistance to Cuba, estimated
by some at $4 billion to $5 billion a year.
   Cuba has about 11 million residents.

<HEAD>Two Arabs Slain; Bodies Found in Cave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police searching a cave in the occupied
territories on Friday found the bodies of two Arabs allegedly
killed by fellow Palestinians as suspected collaborators with
Israel.
   Arab reports said the search was launched after the victims'
families received letters signed by underground Palestinian leaders
saying their sons were killed because they aided the Israelis. They
letters reportedly said the bodies were buried in a nearby cave.
   The victims were identified as Adnan Ijbarah, 28, and Ashraf
Farhan, 22. Arab reporters said masked activists kidnapped the
victims from their homes in Kalkilya in the occupied West Bank on
Nov. 26. They said the two had been killed with sharpened tools.
   Their deaths raised to 321 the number of Palestinians killed by
their fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
At least 779 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians during the three-year uprising and 57 Israelis have also
died in the violence.
   Elsewhere in the occupied lands, at least eight Palestinians
were wounded by army gunfire during stone-throwing clashes,
including a 19-year-old woman who was shot twice in the back,
hospital officials said.
   Also Friday, security forces announced they had uncovered a ring
of Druse youths in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights who are
suspected of spying for Syrian intelligence, army radio said.
   The radio said the investigation began a month ago when two
Druse youths attempted to cross illegally into Syria. One of the
youths was killed and the other captured in a clash with the army.
   State prosecutors plan to present formal charges against
``several'' youths from the Golan village of Majdal Shams, the
radio said.
   The Druse religion is an offshoot of Islam.

<HEAD>Scowcroft Says Attack Not Automatic on Jan. 15</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 3-6: ``Bush, meanwhile,'' comments from magazine
interview</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House raised doubts Friday that the
United States would attack Iraq immediately if it fails to meet
next month's deadline for withdrawing from Kuwait. ``January 15 is
not an attack day at all,'' a senior official said.
   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President
Bush, said the Jan. 15 date was ``an authorization date'' that
tells Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``he'd better get moving now.
After the 15th of January, he is at risk.''
   Bush, meanwhile, underscored his determination to expel Iraq
soon.
   ``It can't drag on with indecision and it can't stop short of
the U.N. mandate (that Saddam completely leave Kuwait),'' Bush
said. ``See, that argues very forcefully against some of these
scenarios that call for somebody to compromise: We'll give him
something for this, give him something so he saves face. That is
not in the books.''
   Bush made his comments in an interview with U.S. News &amp; World
Report. On deciding whether to go to war, Bush said, ``On this
question, I've got it boiled down very clearly to good vs. evil.
And it helps if you can be that clear in your own mind.''
   He said his view was reinforced by an Amnesty International
report detailing human rights abuses in Kuwait. ``It helps one come
to a recognition that the right must prevail,'' the president said.
   The Jan. 15 deadline was prescribed in a United Nations Security
Council resolution authorizing all means necessary to expel Iraq
from Kuwait unless it withdraws on its own by then.
   ``It doesn't say he is going to be attacked this date or that
date or whatever,'' Scowcroft said in an interview with The
Associated Press and reporters rom other news agencies.
   ``One of the important points we're trying to get across to him
is that we haven't blinked so far, we're not blinking now and we
will not blink,'' he added.
   Scowcroft also said Saddam probably was comforted by Thursday's
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who
has backed the tough U.S. stand against Iraq.
   Earlier this week, Bush said he wanted to see the United Nations
resolutions ``fulfilled right on schedule.''
   Moreover, he said, ``I think at midnight (on Jan. 15) if he's
not totally out of Kuwait, the U.N. sanctions must be fulfilled.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Friday there was a good prospect that war could be
averted.
   ``I think that the chance that Saddam Hussein will back out of
this thing is strong,'' Aspin said at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
   He said the administration was trying force the issue to a head
soon. ``What we're talking about is time lines. Do you bring it to
a head now, meaning between now and February - late winter - or do
we ... wait for a year to 18 months for the sanctions to work.
   ``I don't think it's a good policy to try and wait for a year to
18 months to bring it to a head,'' Aspin said.
   For the second time this week, Bush met with ambassadors from
nations that have contributed money and military power to the
Persian Gulf standoff with Saddam. The president refused to answer
reporters' questions.
   ``Bah, humbug,'' he said in his best Scrooge imitation. ``In the
spirit of Christmas, we're not going to have any questions.''
   In his interview, Scowcroft said his remarks were not intended
to raise or dampen prospects for military action Jan. 15.
   ``What I'm saying is the 15th doesn't mean that the troops and
aircraft start to move on the 15th. It's an authorization date for
the use of all measures, and that obviously is the use of force,''
he said.
   Asked if the president had a date in mind for military action,
Scowcroft replied, ``Not that I know of. He may have.''
   ``I hope we don't go to war,'' Scowcroft said. ``What we are not
pointing toward is war. What we are trying to do is to make it
clear to Saddam Hussein what it is he faces.''
   In Saudi Arabia, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said a U.S.
attack against Iraqi forces is growing increasingly likely.
   Gen. Colin Powell, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman,
accompanied Cheney on a visit to U.S. troops in the gulf.
   Powell said he hoped for a peaceful solution but drew roars of
approval when he pledged ``When we launch it, we will launch it
violently; we will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so
we can get it over as quickly as possible and there's no question
who won.''

<TEXT>
   The White House said Friday the resignation of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was ``troubling''
and expressed concern that Moscow might back away from its program
of reforms.
   The administration's second-day analysis of Shevardnadze's
departure reflected clear unease about what lies ahead in terms of
internal divisions in the Soviet Union and U.S.-Soviet cooperation
on the Persian Gulf and arms control.
   President Bush said there was no evidence that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was changing his gulf policy.
   ``I've talked to Gorbachev at length about it ... and I would be
very surprised if he shifted, and I see no evidence of it,'' the
president said in an interview with U.S. News &amp; World Report.
   Bush said he was surprised by Shevardnadze's resignation, adding
that ``we have great respect'' for him.
   As for chances for a Soviet dictatorship, a fear expressed by
Shevardnadze, Bush said, ``I don't know.
   ``I know that there has been concern there about the appearance
of anarchy and dissolution of the state ...''
   Bush said he discussed Gorbachev's problems with him during a
meeting last month in Paris. ``I think he is still committed to
reform and openness but beyond that I can't go,'' the president
said.
   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President
Bush, said one person who would be happy about Shevardnadze's
resignation would be Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Shevardnadze has been a strong supporter of the U.S. stand in
the Persian Gulf. ``But if you're Saddam Hussein, naturally,
anybody who's removed from the scene who has had that policy would
be welcome'' to go, Scowcroft said.
   He discussed Shevardnadze's action in an interview with The
Associated Press and other news agencies.
   ``There is no doubt that it's troubling in some respects,''
Scowcroft said. ``He has been, if not the architect, the
implementer of much of the foreign policy changes that we've seen
over the past several years.''
   But, Scowcroft added, ``We don't base our policy on
personalities. The basic architect, (Soviet President Mikhail)
Gorbachev, is still there, but I think the concern is whether or
not he thinks there is a shift in direction internally, and we feel
strongly that the reforms should continue.''
   Specifically, he said Shevardnadze's warning of a dictatorship
emerging in the Soviet Union was troubling.
   He noted that the foreign minister, in his resignation speech
Thursday, ``pointed right at the uniformed colonels and blamed them
for wanting to reverse some of the perestroika (reform) programs.''
   Bush and Gorbachev tentatively are set to meet in Moscow Feb.
11-13 for the signing of a treaty, still be negotiated, to slash
strategic nuclear weapons. Shevardnadze has been a key player in
the arms talks.
   Asked if the summit timing might be affected by Shevardnadze's
departure, Scowcroft said ``At this point, I would say no, but ...
we have to wait and see what the impact of the change in the Soviet
Union may be in policy terms, and it may not be any at all.''
   As far as the Persian Gulf is concerned, Scowcroft said ``our
perception is that President Gorbachev is strongly of the same
view'' as Shevardnadze in backing the United States.
   ``I think there's no doubt that he (Shevardnadze) was strongly,
strongly in favor of the role that the Soviet Union has played in
the gulf policy,'' Scowcroft said. ``There's no question about
that. Whether it will be diminished by his departure, it's hard to
tell at this point.''

<HEAD>Warring Liberian Parties Agree to Choose Interim Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Liberia's three warring factions agreed
Friday to hold a conference inside that country within 60 days to
choose a caretaker government.
   The ``all-Liberia'' conference was announced in a statement at
the end of two days of talks in Banjul, Gambia. The talks in this
West African country were intended to allow the combatants to
negotiate an end to the yearlong civil war, which has left more
than 12,000 civilians dead.
   The rival parties apparently were unable to agree on anything
except the conference at the Gambian talks, which were mediated by
the Economic Community of West African States. It was not clear how
the meeting was affected by the absence of rebel leader Charles
Taylor, who sent only a representative.
   The agreement to choose a new interim government put in question
the role of a temporary administration already installed in
Monrovia, the Liberian capital, under the sponsorship of the West
African community. Taylor had refused to join the government led by
Amos Sawyer, calling it a puppet of Liberia's West African
neighbors. The two other warring factions both have seats in
Sawyer's administration.
   A major aim of the Banjul meeting was to negotiate how a West
African intervention force already in Monrovia would police a
cease-fire agreed Nov. 28.
   Friday's statement said another meeting would be held within 30
days to discuss monitoring the cease-fire. In the meantime, the
three armies said they would remain in positions they held when the
fighting stopped.
   The participants also were to discuss disarming the warring
sides. Friday's communique said the interim government to be chosen
at the ``all-Liberia'' conference would organize the disarmament.
   Signatories to Friday's agreement are the National Patriotic
Front of Taylor, breakaway rebel leader Prince Johnson and remnants
of slain President Samuel Doe's army led by Brig. Hezekiah Bowen.
   Taylor's men are spread throughout Liberia outside of Monrovia.
The West African soldiers have confined Johnson's and Bowen's men
to separate barracks around the capital.
   Taylor started the war with a Christmas Eve invasion from Ivory
Coast to oust Doe, who was accused of corruption and repression.
Doe was captured and killed earlier this year.

<HEAD>Croatia Adopts New Constitution Authorizing Secession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Croatian Parliament adopted a new
constitution Friday that would give the country's second-largest
republic the right to secede, media reports said.
   The move is likely to worsen the traditionally tense relations
between Croatians and minority Serbs in the republic.
   The new constitution follows an electoral victory last spring by
the center-right government over Communists who had been ruling the
republic.
   The new document provides for Croatia to secede from Yugoslavia
if two-thirds of the legislature votes for such a proposal, the
reports said.
   They said a state-wide plebiscite would then have to be held. If
a simple majority of the electorate votes in favor of secession,
the motion would be upheld.
   Friday's vote was preceded by an acrimonious debate over
minority rights between ethnic Serbian and Croatian deputies in the
legislature, the national Tanjug news agency reported.
   It said that 16 deputies representing Croatia's 500,000-member
Serbian minority walked out of the parliamentary session before the
vote to protest what they claimed was the failure of the new
constitution to guarantee their national identity.
   Also on Friday, ethnic Serbs in Knin, a town near the central
Adriatic coast, proclaimed the autonomy of their Krajina area,
saying they would remain part of Croatia only if the state stays
within Yugoslavia.
   ``This is a great day for all Serbs,'' said Jovan Raskovic,
political leader of the Serbian minority, as he raised the Serbian
flag over Knin castle, radio Belgrade reported.
   Since August, one policeman has been killed and several others
wounded in inter-ethnic violence in Krajina.
   The Croatian authorities have vowed not to permit any part of
the republic to break away. They deny the Serbs' accusations of
discrimination, contending the Communist government in Serbia is
manipulating local Serbs to destabilize Croatia.
   The northern state of Slovenia, the most prosperous of
Yugoslavia's six republics, is due Sunday to hold a referendum on
secession. Slovenia and Croatia advocate turning Yugoslavia into a
loose confederation of virtually independent states.
   The Slovenian ballot is strongly opposed by Serbia, the
country's largest republic, which favors the continuation of
Yugoslavia as a federation with a strong central government.

<TEXT>
   President Violeta Chamorro, trying to
keep peace with her leftist opponents, convinced the legislature
Friday to accept a budget limiting cuts for the Sandinista-led
army.
   But she won lawmakers' support by, among other things, promising
to remove the leftist Sandinista army commander, Gen. Humberto
Ortega, by 1993.
   The legislative vote, following a veto of larger cuts by Mrs.
Chamorro, represents a major defeat for conservatives in her
coalition. They had fought for greater reductions.
   However, Mrs. Chamorro had said that without the concessions to
the military, the country could be faced with disturbances.
   Mrs. Chamorro's early months in office were plagued by
Sandinista-sponsored general strikes, forcing her to sign a
compromise social pact with her political opponents and touching
off a backlash in her own coalition.
   On Friday, national legislators voted 69-21 to sustain Mrs.
Chamorro's veto of the bill they previously approved that would
have shaved $19.6 million from her initial $78.6 million army
budget for 1991. The budget approved Friday provided $70 million
for the military.
   Twenty-nine members of Mrs. Chamorro's coalition switched their
vote to join one independent deputy and the 39 Sandinista deputies
in sustaining the veto. One legislator in the 92-member body did
not vote.
  The army's current budget, the last approved by the former
Sandinista government, was $190 million this year.
   Presidential secretary Antonio Lacayo called the vote ``a rotund
defeat for the extremists'' in the 14-party United National
Opposition, or UNO. The coalition supported Mrs. Chamorro in her
February election win over Sandinista incumbent Daniel Ortega, the
army commander's brother.
   Former Sandinista party president Sergio Ramirez said the vote
represents an upset for ``a spurious opposition.'' Five UNO parties
voted against Mrs. Chamorro's veto.
   Deputy Humberto Castilla, a hard-liner who voted against the
veto and lower cuts, said he rejected Mrs. Chamorro's offer because
``they are very vague.''
   Vice-President Virgilio Godoy, who has opposed Mrs. Chamorro's
concessions to the Sandinistas, called the veto ``a serious
mistake.''
   UNO mayors and former Contra rebels launched a wave of riots,
protest blockades and building takeovers in November in eastern
Nicaragua. They demanded removal of Gen. Ortega as army chief.
   In a prepared speech Friday, Mrs. Chamorro promised to replace
Gen. Ortega by 1993. She said she will replace him with a civilian
only ``when I feel that the process of military reduction has
surpassed the stage that I consider critical and risky to the
country.''
   She said the general is the only man who has ``the moral
authority and the capability to effect the reductions'' in the size
of the army without creating a crisis, assembly budget committee
president Luis Humberto Guzman said.
   Mrs. Chamorro has said any drastic changes within the armed
forces could produce Sandinista discontent and shatter the
country's fragile internal peace. Mrs. Chamorro has promised to cut
3,000 soldiers during 1991. She has reduced troop strength from
100,000 to 28,434 since she took office April 25.

<HEAD>Safety Experts Project Up to 480 Deaths in Holiday Traffic
Accidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety experts on Friday projected between 380
and 480 people will die in traffic accidents on U.S. highways
during the four-day Christmas holiday.
   The National Safety Council each year estimates the number of
holiday traffic fatalities for the heavily traveled holiday period,
which began at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday.
   Last year, 372 people died during the three-day Christmas
holiday.
   This year's projection is higher because Christmas falls on a
Tuesday, extending the holiday period an additional day, said
council statistician Terry Miller.
   Safety officials say the death toll could be lower than in
previous four-day Christmas periods because high gasoline prices
may deter people from making long car trips or from going to social
events.
   ``People may just decide to limit their driving to necessary
errands, going to the store and other things of that nature,''
Miller said. ``But it's hard to predict people's behavior in such
situations.''
   The council makes its projections by comparing the average
number of traffic deaths each day of the current year with
historical figures on traffic fatalities during past holiday
seasons.
   The council also projects that between 350 and 450 people will
die in on the nation's roads during the four-day New Year holiday
period.

<HEAD>Egyptian Reinforcements Strengthen Arab Force Against Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YANBU, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the anti-Iraqi Arab
force welcomed Egyptian reinforcements Friday and said the
multinational force has everything it needs to go to war.
   ``The troops are ready,'' said Lt. Gen. Khalid Bin Sultan of the
Arab -Islamic armies deployed on a defensive line in front of
American, British and French troops in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   ``With what we have right now, I am completely satisfied,
whether it's our Arab-Muslim forces or our friendly forces,'' the
Saudi officer said. ``We are ready to do what our supreme
commanders tell us to do.''
   Earlier this week, American Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller,
second-in-command of Operation Desert Shield, said his ground
troops might not be ready until mid-February.
   Other senior commanders, however, said they are prepared to
apply force to back up a Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to leave
Kuwait.
   On Friday, Khalid, a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, greeted
an armored brigade of about 5,000 soldiers and 94 tanks of the
Egyptian 4th Armored Division. When in place, the division will
boost the number of Egyptian troops to about 27,000 - the largest
of the Arab forces in Saudi Arabia.
   The 4th Division is specially trained in fighting urban battles,
which is what the recapture of Kuwait City would entail. However,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said his forces would only be
used to defend Saudi Arabia and would go into Kuwait only in a
peacekeeping role.
   Established in 1956, the division fought against Israel that
year and again in 1967 and 1973. It crossed the Suez Canal in the
1973 war, surprising the Israelis who thought the maneuver was
impossible. The division also trained with the U.S. Army's 24th
Mechanized Division in a 1988 joint operation called Bright Star.
   Khalid called the Arab show of force opposing Iraq's Aug. 2
takeover of Kuwait as a battle of ``right against tyranny'' and
pledged to help the defeated country ``even if we become martyrs to
restore what is right.''
   The general spoke to a formation of troops who had arrived
Wednesday. They had rolled their American-made M60 battle tanks,
M113 armored personnel carriers and M109 self-propelled howitzers
onto a lot in Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea.
   ``We are here to defend the right and defend the peace. The
whole world is with us,'' said Major Gen. Salah Halaby, commander
of the Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Capt. Alla Eldin Ahmed, a company commander, said chances of war
are about ``50-50'' as a Jan. 15 U.N. deadline approaches for Iraq
to quit Kuwait or face a military response.
   ``I'm ready for any fight,'' said Ahmed. ``This is the best
brigade in the Egyptian Army.''

   The smallest city in this country's
smallest state is in danger of dying and needs a transfusion of
state funds to survive, a commission reviewing the community's
financial health said Friday.
   Even if the state of Rhode Island takes financial responsibility
for the schools of Central Falls, this gritty mill city of 17,000
could expire, members of a state review commission said.
   ``The clock is ticking. We don't have much time. If you have a
heart problem and you don't get a transplant, what's the
alternative?'' asked James Mahoney, vice chairman of the Central
Falls Review Commission.
   The city, named for the Blackstone River falls that powered the
birth of the modern textile industry, is wedged between several
larger communities just north of Providence.
   It the city is dissolved, the state would assume responsibilty
for the health, welfare and safety of community residents. A draft
report by the review commission said the state is not prepared to
assume that responsiblity.
   Although the smallest in the state, this ethnically diverse,
mile-square community also is among the most densely populated in
Rhode Island and is one of the 10 most densely populated cities in
the country.
   Mahoney is fiscal adviser to the Rhode Island House of
Representatives. He helped assemble this year's state budget that
gave Central Falls $500,000 in aid but also mandated an examination
of the city's fiscal health.
   In its report, the commission painted a stark picture of the
city's problems: a possible $7 million deficit this year in a
budget of $21 million. Next year's shortfall could be $11 million.
   Because education accounts for more than half the city's budget,
a state takeover of the schools could allow Central Falls to
resolve its fiscal troubles, said Daniel W. Varin, state planning
director and chairman of the review commission.
   Varin said he would like to see the state have a large say in
the schools but not total management control.
   Mayor Thomas Lazieh said he liked Varin's idea. He also said he
liked the commission's suggestion that Central Falls sell its water
system to neighboring Pawtucket and share public services such as
police, fire and libraries with neighboring municipalities.
   But he rejected the idea of dissolving the city. Lazieh said
maintaining an independent city was the cheapest way of getting
services to its residents.
   The commission said it, too, opposed dissolving the city - at
least for now.
   Despite the highest property tax rate in the state - $54.75 per
$1,000 of assessed valuation - the commission said Central Falls
ranks 35th among the 39 cities and towns on spending per person for
city services.
   Textiles long ago moved away, leaving old mill buildings and
three-decker tenements and little land to develop - the crux of
Central Falls' problem. Little vacant land means little chance to
increase the property tax base.
   Still, there is much ethnic pride in Central Falls, home to
immigrants including French-Canadians, Irish, Poles, Syrians and
Portuguese.
   ``You had to speak a little French and Syrian to get by where I
grew up,'' said Bill Benson, the city's dog officer.
   City Council President Albert Laroche said the city got a ``bum
rap'' beginning in the early 1980s with national attention as a
cocaine trafficking center.
   ``Really, no one here in the city wants to dissolve the city,''
Larouche said. ``I've no intention of moving anywhere else. It's
the furthest thing from my mind.''

   The Federal Reserve set the stage for its
recent interest rate reductions at a mid-November meeting of its
monetary policy committee, according to minutes of the meeting
released Friday.
   The central bank has permitted a lowering of its federal funds
rate four times since October and on Wednesday dropped the discount
rate from 7 percent to 6.5 percent, the first decline in four
years.
   The 0.25 percentage point decline in the federal funds rate on
Oct. 29, to 7.75 percent, was in response to the federal
budget-cutting agreement between the Bush adminsitration and
Congress.
   But the Federal Open Market Committee noted weakening economic
activity at its Nov. 13 meeting and agreed to another ``slight
reduction.''
   The move, the minutes said, was designed to ``provide some
insurance against a deep and prolonged recession without incurring
a substantial risk in current circumstances of fostering
intensified inflationary pressures.''
  And, the minutes said, the committee agreed to give weight ``to
potential developments that might require some slight further
easing'' until the next meeting which was held last Tuesday and was
followed by the discount rate reduction and the lowering of the
federal funds rate to 7.0 percent.
   Between the two meetings, the federal funds rate fell to 7.5
percent on Nov. 16 and to 7.25 percent on Dec. 7. The rate is the
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. The discount
rate is the interest the Fed charges banks.
   The minutes show that the committee members were concerned about
``the growing signs of a softening economy, the related
vulnerability of many business and financial firms to added
financial strains and the increased reluctance of institutional
lenders to accommodate less than prime business borrowers.''
   The committee vote was unanimous. The Fed's monetary
policy-setting arm is comprised of the seven board members and five
of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks. There currently
is one vacancy on the board.

   Winter made its entrance Friday on howling frigid winds
generated by an Arctic cold front.
   On the first official day of winter the cold front ushered snow
and bitter cold temperatures into the Mississippi Valley and the
southern Plains. Temperatures plunged below zero from the northern
Plateau and the Great Basin to the upper Mississippi Valley,
turning gasoline to gel and stranding motorists by the hundreds.
   Three cities reported all-time record lows Friday morning.
Casper, Wyo., hit 41 below zero, Redding, Calif., dropped to 17 to
tie their record and Sacremento matched its all time low of 21
degrees.
   Amtrak's ``Empire Builder'' from Seattle to Chicago was delayed
by the cold. The train that left Seattle on Tuesday arrived in
Fargo, N.D., 24 hours late.
   ``It's cold enough to crack (rails) when the ice builds up,''
Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said. ``Sometimes it just separates
the rails, but whether it actually cracks a rail or simply
separates a rail, you can't operate a train. You have to wait to
get a repair crew there.''
   As the cold moved south, the temperature dropped 24 degrees in
30 minutes in Page, Okla., a small town in the Ouachita National
Forest. It was 2 below in Amarillo, Texas, and 6 above in Lubbock.
   Snow extended across much of the Great Plains at midday
spreading into the middle and upper Mississippi Valley. Strong
northwesterly winds brought bitter Arctic air into the center of
the nation resulting in dangerous wind chill factors.
   Jamestown, N.D., reported a wind chill of 70 below zero, while
winds at Grand Forks produced a wind chill of 76 degrees below
zero.
   Winter storm warnings, watches and advisories were posted into
Saturday from the northern Plains to the southern Plains and the
Mississippi Valley for heavy snow and debilitating wind chills..
   Friday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 50 below zero
at Worland, Wyo.

   A conservative coalition protesting legislative
practices failed Friday in an attempt to bring down the Socialist
government of Premier Michel Rocard, who narrowly survived a
no-confidence vote last month.
   The Intergroup bloc claimed Rocard's government showed
``contempt'' for the parliament by including proposed legislation
in recent votes of confidence. If the vote of confidence passes,
the bill is also approved.
   The censure motion received 218 votes from the 577-seat National
Assembly, 70 votes short of the number needed to dissolve the
government.
   Neither the centrists nor the Communists agreed to back the
motion.
   Intergroup is made up of the Rally for the Republic and the
Union for French Democracy parties.
   In November, a censure motion, the first the Communist Party
agreed to back, was five votes short of passing. It was filed to
protest a new 1.1 percent social services tax to replace an
existing tax paid by employers and employees.

   Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis heeded air raid sirens Friday
and jammed the rads out of Baghdad in an evacuation drill to test
war readiness. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said armed conflict is
increasingly likely.
   Gen. Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added
that any attack on Iraq would be swift and decisive. He and Cheney
visited U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``When we launch it, we will launch it violently,'' Powell said.
``We will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we can
get it over as quickly as possible and there's no question who
won.''
   However, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to
President Bush, said Jan. 15, the U.N. deadline for Iraq to leave
Kuwait, is just ``an authorization date.''
   ``It doesn't say he is going to be attacked this date or that
date or whatever,'' Scowcroft said in an interview in Washington
with The Associated Press and other news agencies.
   Off Haifa, Israel, at least one U.S. sailor was killed when a
navy vessel ferrying about 100 seamen to the USS Saratoga capsized
early Saturday. The sailors, on shore leave, were returning to the
aircraft carrier, deployed in the Mideast as part of the
multinational force against Iraq. Cause of the accident was not
immediately known.
   Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, predicted an Iraqi victory in any war
with the multinational force arrayed against him and stood by his
refusal to pull out of Kuwait. He spoke in an interview on German
television.
   ``In the event of war, there will be great losses, not just in
terms of human life,'' Saddam said. ``Allah is on our side, so we
will defeat the aggressors.''
   The Iraqi government is believed to have a large arsenal of
chemical weapons and missiles, along with its powerful army. In
Bonn, the German government said Friday it was investigating U.S.
suspicions that German companies have continued sending supplies to
Iraq, despite the U.N. embargo.
   A German magazine said one company supplied Iraq with nuclear
training and equipment, while two others have helped Baghdad with
nerve gas production.
   Der Spiegel said Washington has given Bonn a list of 50 German
companies suspected of violating the U.N. embargo. The Bonn
government confirmed it received the list and said the allegations
were being examined, but that so far it had no proof.
   Sirens blared in Baghdad Friday and residents, clutching
blankets and food, jumped into cars or rushed to special centers
where they caught buses to evacuation camps set up outside the
capital.
   Roads leading out of the city were jammed with thousands of
cars, trucks, buses and even carriages pulled by tractors.
   The evacuation drill began at 7 a.m. and ended five hours later.
It was conducted for the half of Baghdad that lies on the east bank
of the Tigris River.
   But only about half the area's 2 million people participated,
said residents, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said
people locked their doors and watched television rather than get
stuck in the traffic jams.
   A second exercise Saturday will cover west Baghdad.
   Basra, Iraq's second-largest city with a million residents, was
evacuated in a similar exercise Thursday.
   ``It is useful. If a war broke out, God forbid, we need to be
out of our areas,'' Samir Abdul Aziz, 45, a dentist, said at one
evacuation camp.
   Iraq has increased its preparations for war since the U.N.
Security Council authorized force to remove Baghdad's troops from
Kuwait if they have not left the emirate by Jan. 15.
   Iraqi media now carry instructions for building bomb shelters
and courses in civil defense and first aid.
   In Saudi Arabia, Cheney told U.S. troops that war was drawing
closer.
   ``It increasingly looks like (Saddam's) not getting the message
and we'll have to use force,'' Cheney said. ``The only acceptable
outcome, if hostilities begin, is absolute, total victory.''
   Cheney said U.S. military officials don't think ``waiting
indefinitely is going to solve the problem.''
   About 280,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Saudi Arabia as part
of the nearly 400,000-strong multinational force. They face about
510,000 Iraqi troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   In the interview with Germany's ZDF television network, Saddam
was asked if he would pull his troops out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15
deadline. ``No,'' he answered.
   ``We are certain that even when Bush pushes his country into
war, which he plans, he can't keep it going,'' said Saddam. He did
not elaborate.
   In other developments:
   -The U.S. military command said eight American soldiers have
been poisoned by home-brewed alcohol and hospitalized since Sunday.
The soldiers, from the 101st Airborne Division, are the first known
casualties of home-brewed liquor since U.S. forces were deployed in
Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country that bans all alcohol.
   -Some U.S. troops went on a low-level alert for a possible
chemical attack Friday after reports of a missile test-firing. The
Pentagon later said that Israel held an unannounced missile test
hundreds of miles away. It would not comment on the alert.
   An NBC television crew, in the radio room of a U.S. Coast Guard
patrol boat about five miles off eastern Saudi Arabia, videotaped
an exchange about the missile firing which appeared to indicate
Iraq had fired the missile.
   But in Washington, a Pentagon official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he had no information indicating that Iraq had
fired a Scud missile.

   Choppy water prevented a salvage team from
reaching a sunken scrap barge Friday, as a result continuing to
threaten ship traffic in part of the country's busiest inland port.
   The Coast Guard opened 4 miles of the Allegheny River to a coal
barge but said the waterway would remain closed to most ships,
especially tankers carrying fuel or other liquids, until the rusty
craft was located.
   ``That coal barge is going through at its own risk, and if he
were to dump the load of coal in the river it wouldn't be
significant environmental damage,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Rhea Giacoma.
   An Azcon Scrap salvage crew Friday afternoon suspended the
search for the barge until Saturday because of rough water about 4
miles northeast of downtown Pittsburgh near the Highland Park Dam.
   The crew was confident the barge was below the dam Friday
because of an unusual current about 40 feet from the river's north
bank, said Richard Spine, Azcon's executive vice president.
   An undertow prevented divers from going underwater and a strong
surface current prevented the search tugboat from getting near
enough to drag the river at that spot, he said.
   The 4-mile section of the rain-swollen river was closed to all
ships Wednesday and Thursday. Commerce on the Monongahela and Ohio
rivers was unaffected.
   Ms. Giacoma said the Coast Guard would review requests for
passage on the Allegheny River to determine if their cargo could
damage the river in an accident.
   The barge has been loose on the river since Dec. 14, when it
broke free as it was towed to the Azcon Scrap Corp. yard for
dismantling as scrap steel.
   Two employees jumped to safety before the steel barge sailed
over a dam, dug into the river mud and bent at a 45-degree angle.
Record rainfall on Tuesday washed it further downstream.
   When the barge's location is confirmed, warning buoys will be
placed in the river and the waterway will reopen to all traffic,
Ms. Giacoma said. Spine said the spot where the barge apparently
sank is away from the river's main shipping channel.
   ``If there is such a thing as a convenient place for a barge to
sink, this is it,'' he said.
   If the barge can be lifted from the river bottom, it will be
chopped up as scrap steel, Spine said.
   Four U.S. Army Corps of Engineers locks above the sunken barge
reported little activity Friday because most barges remained at
their landings, waiting for the river to open, said Corps civil
engineer Jim Mershimer.

   Reputed crime boss John Goti was denied bail
Friday and will spend Christmas in jail while facing charges of
murder, racketeering and conspiracy.
   U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn decided against
bail after a three-hour closed hearing.
   During the proceeding, prosecutors played secretly recorded
tapes they say show Gotti and his two co-defendants are a threat to
the public and should be held without bail.
   Glasser reopened the courtroom after the hearing to announce his
ruling.
   ``I have concluded that the government has sustained its burden
by clear and conclusive evidence,'' Glasser said. ``There are no
conditions of release that would reasonably assure the safety of
any other person in the community.''
   Gotti, 50, and his co-defendants, alleged underboss Frank
Locascio, 58, and reputed mob counselor Salvatore Gravano, 45, have
been jailed since Dec. 11. Federal agents arrested them on murder,
racketeering and conspiracy charges.
   Law enforcers described the three as the leaders of the Gambino
crime family, reputedly the most powerful criminal syndicate in the
country.
   A hearing was set for Jan. 18.
   Media lawyers had argued for an open hearing, noting Gotti has
been acquitted of crimes three times in the past five years despite
media coverage. His acquittals have earned him the nickname ``the
Teflon Don.''
   Prosecutors allege Gotti engineered the slaying of his
predecessor, Paul Castellano, to seize control of the Gambino crime
family.

<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $14.3 million Friday to a former
ballerina who was paralyzed from the waist down after a 1983 crash
in a car driven by former New York Yankee infielder Andre
Robertson.
   The state Supreme Court jury decided Thursday that Robertson and
the city were responsible for Shenikwa Dawn Nowlin's injuries.
Nowlin, 31, was the Dance Theater of Harlem's youngest member when
she was 14. She is now a Dallas attorney.
   The jury found the city liable for 67 percent of the award
because a sign warning of a curve on Manhattan's West Side Highway
was too near the bend for a driver to react in time. The jury also
found Robertson 33 percent liable because he exceeded the speed
limit.
   ``Nobody can be compensated for the kinds of injuries I
received,'' Nowlin said later, outside the courtroom. ``If I had it
to do over again, I'd be walking and not sitting here. No money can
pay for what has happened to me.''
   Nowlin's spine was broken when Robertson smashed his car into a
highway embankment around 5 a.m. on Aug. 18, 1983.
   The two, friends since they were students at the University of
Texas, had been to a nightclub and were on their way to take
pictures of the Statue of Liberty.
   Robertson, 33, is out of baseball and now works in a steam
generating plant at Dupont's Sabine River Works in Orange, Texas.
   
   Robertson's attorney, Daniel McNamara, said his client's
insurance will cover about $25,000 of the award. He said Robertson
can't afford the balance so the city by law will be liable for
almost the entire award.
   It wasn't immediately known if the city would appeal the award.

   A powerful car bomb exploded before dawn
Friday at the city's most exclusive shopping mall, injuring three
private guards. Police suspect Maoist Shining Path guerrillas in
the attack.
   The blast in the mall's indoor parking lot buckled the garage
walls and blew a large hole in the roof of a bingo parlor. The
explosion was heard more than five miles away.
   Police said the car was packed with at least 65 pounds of
dynamite.
   The three guards were wounded by flying glass.
   The explosion shattered windows 150 yards away and ripped
Christmas decorations from the outer wall of the 10-story building.
It blew out display cases in dozens of stores.
   The bomb also broke the face of a clock in a church tower across
from the mall in the upper-class neighborhood of San Isidro.
   The mall was nearly deserted at the time of the blast. During
shopping hours, the complex would have been packed with members of
Lima's elite society.
   Neither of Peru's two leftist rebel groups claimed
responsibility for the bombing, but police said it was similar to
other attacks by the Shining Path.
   The Shining Path has exploded numerous car bombs in Lima in
recent years. Most of the attacks have occurred late at night,
apparently to avoid wounding passersby.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
civil fraud charges Friday against an uninsured storefront ``bank''
whose collapse threw more than $6.8 million in deposits of recent
Salvadoran immigrants into jeopardy.
   The commission also obtained a temporary order from U.S.
District Court freezing the assets of three top officers of Latin
Investment Corp. of Washington.
   The corporation's assets were frozen Dec. 15 when it was forced
into seeking bankruptcy court protection from creditors. A
bankruptcy judge as ordered the company liquidated.
   The commission said it had contacted the government of El
Salvador to locate any assets there that would be subject to a
freeze order although the countries have no formal cooperation
agreement.
   A hearing on the commission's request for an injunction against
the defendants was scheduled for Jan. 14.
   ``There is evidence to suggest that individuals who were
nominally drawing salaries of slightly in excess of $20,000 a year
have acquired very expensive real estate in the Washington area. We
intend to go after that real estate if we establish liability and
try for the recovery of assets that may have been improperly
diverted,'' said commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden.
   Commission officials said they had referred the Latin Investment
matter to Washington, D.C. local officials when it first came to
light in 1987.
   Breeden said if Latin had been chartered as a bank, supervised
by local bank regulators and under federal deposit insurance there
would have been little for the commission to do.
   William McLucas, head of the commission's Enforcement Division,
said District of Columbia officials assured the commission on
several occasions in 1988 that they were taking steps to ensure
that Latin would get a bank charter.
   The city's Office of Banking and Financial Institutions was
closed when called late Friday for comment.
   According to the complaint, Latin Investment, founded in 1982,
had about 3,500 investors who had placed about $6.8 million with
the investment company as of August this year. Investors have said
they deposited money with Latin because it had tellers who spoke
Spanish.
   The Wilson International Center, a private community group that
is helping investors, said the amount in jeopardy was more like $13
million in deposits, an average of more than $3,700 apiece.
   The complaint alleges that Latin, which operated without a bank
charter or government banking insurance, misled investors into
thinking their funds would be safe and available on demand.
   Also named as defendants and as the target of various requested
court orders were: founder Fernando Leonzo of Vienna, Va.; the
corporation's secretary, Leonel Salinas of Falls Church, Va.; and
vice president Jose A. Cortes of Arlington, Va.
   Leonzo, through his lawyer Charles Pearson, denied the
commission allegations.
   ``We have a different version of events, and that will certainly
come forward in due time,'' Pearson said. ``We're not trying to
hide anything. What we're trying to do is repay depositors.''

<HEAD>Ceremony That Turned Fatal Claims 13th Victim</HEAD>

   A woman has become the 13th person to die
from injuries apparently suffered when a butane lantern filled a
small house with carbon monoxide fumes during an all-night
religious ceremony, authorities said.
   The woman, Consuelo Ponce, 40, died Thursday at the Social
Security Hospital, said state coroner's office and state public
ministry officials.
   Ms. Ponce was taken to the hospital in a coma on Dec. 13 after
attending a religious ceremony in a shantytown neighborhood in this
border city south of San Diego.
   After the deaths there was speculation victims had been poisoned
by food and fruit punch consumed during the ceremony that began
Dec. 12, the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of
Mexico.
   But tissue and blood tests on the 12 who died earlier indicated
they had not consumed alcohol or another toxic substance,
authorities said.
   The victims had gathered at the home of Federico Padres Mexia, a
self-styled spiritual leader who claimed he could perform miracles
and had communicated with God.
   Padres, 61, and another survivor remain hospitalized in a coma
Thursday, said Leonardo Cortes, a state public ministry spokesman.
   An autopsy was to be held to determine Ms. Ponce's cause of
death.
   Authorities earlier determined the other 12 died of asphyxiation
from carbon monoxide emitted by the leaky butane gas lamp used to
light the unventilated house.
   Authorities also believe the fatal level of carbon monoxide may
have been aggravated by the burning of Epsom salts during the
ritual, which the victims' survivors said was intended to cleanse
their souls or change their luck.

   A police task force worked Friday to narrow
a list of suspects in seven shotgun slayings in northwest Indiana,
where merchants are arming, schools are locking doors and fear has
spoiled Christmas for many.
   Police are putting out extra patrols to protect vulnerable
late-night businesses in this small town, where two of the killings
occurred last week, the latest in the string of slayings that began
Oct. 30.
   The latest victims are two brothers who were killed Tuesday in a
tailor shop.
   All the attacks - shotgun blasts at close range - have occurred
in late afternoon or after dark within a 20-mile radius of Gary, a
blue-collar industrial city about 10 miles west of Portage.
   Two victims were killed at gasoline stations, another at a motel
desk, another near a bank cash station, one in a parking lot, and
two at the tailor shop.
   ``They don't know when he's going to hit next, if he's going to
hit again,'' said Karen Klenk, general manager of Lees Inn of
Portage.
   Mrs. Klenk has doubled night clerks and advised them to be extra
cautious with late-night visitors to the motel, which is less than
a mile from the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge where a desk clerk was
killed Dec. 15.
   Several Gary-area elementary schools kept their doors locked
during classes this week, but Mrs. Klenk and other area residents
say there's no real protection against sudden violence.
   Gary Stasik, manager of a Portage gasoline station, said he is
``angered at the person out there, the SOB who is trying to ruin
people's lives, ruin people's Christmas, ruin the lives of the
survivors.''
   Investigators believe one man is responsible for all the
killings.
   The first victim was a Hammond man who was gunned down Oct. 30
in a parking lot in Griffith. One other person was killed that
night, a woman who was closing a Cedar Lake gasoline station, and
two others were shot at but missed.
   Police from northwest Indiana joined the Indiana State Police
and FBI investigators in a task force of more than 30 investigators
on Dec. 14.
   Since then, hundreds of tips have poured in, said Portage police
Sgt. Warren Lewis, spokesman for the task force.
   Police are focusing on several suspects, Lewis said, but he
declined to give any details.
   Police believe the assailant is a man somewhere between 20 and
35 years old who drives a boxy white car. He may have suffered
recent emotional trauma, Lewis said.
   Police released a composite sketch and psychological profile
that says friends or relatives might recognize him by a recent
change in his life or comments he has made about the killings.
   Experts in the Lake County crime lab are examining shotgun
shells left behind at the scenes of four slayings to determine
whether all were fired from the same gun.
   Dr. Daniel Thomas, Lake County coroner, has said the shells show
``definite similarities.''
   In Gary, some merchants said they have misgivings about staying
open, even if armed.
   ``My kids have been after me to close up over here, especially
after this,'' said Fran Ostrowski, owner of Fran's Jewelry. ``But I
like to work. I hope I'm not pushing it.''
   Mrs. Ostrowski runs the business with her husband, Ray. They
have kept guns in their small store since they opened 10 years ago
in a neighborhood now checkered by vacant windows and boarded-up
shops.
   Ostrowski wears a .32-caliber pistol on his belt and keeps a
12-gauge pump shotgun within arm's reach of his back-room desk.
   ``It's too late to say, `I wish I had my gun,' after somebody's
shooting at you,'' he said.

   Pope John Paul II will attend the closing
day of a national Eucharistic congress in Brazil next year, the
Brazilian foreign affairs minister was quoted as saying Friday.
   It will be the pope's second visit to the South American nation,
which has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world with
nearly 106 million followers.
   According to ANSA, the pontiff will be in the city of Natal for
the close of the congress on Oct. 13. He will also visit the
capital of Brasilia.
   In August, the pontiff will visit Hungary and Poland, ANSA
reported.
   The pope is scheduled to arrive in Hungary on Aug. 16 on a
flight from the Polish Marian shrine of Czestochowa, where he will
lead ``World Youth Day'' celebrations.

<HEAD>Ohio Governor Grants Clemency to 25 Women Prisoners, Citing
Battering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT E. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Celeste on Friday granted
clemency to 25 women prisoners who he said committed crimes because
they were victims of battering or other forms of physical or
emotional abuse.
   The lame-duck governor said he reviewed 105 cases in which
``battered woman syndrome'' was suspected. The Ohio Supreme Court
and the state Legislature in March established the syndrome as a
defense against murder and other crimes.
   Most of the inmates were serving time for such crimes as murder,
manslaughter and assault.
   Paperwork and other procedures probably will mean the women
won't be released until after Christmas, Celeste said at a news
conference.
   The governor included a stipulation that all of those freed must
perform 200 hours of community service in domestic violence
programs. He also said each woman must serve at least two years
before being released. Four of the 25 women have spent fewer than
two years in prison.
   Of the cases the governor reviewed, 32 were sent back to the
state Parole Board for further review and 48 were rejected, he
said. He said he was still reviewing about 15 other cases and would
announce his decisions next month.
   Celeste said Ohio was the last state to recognize the plight of
battered women when the Ohio Supreme Court in March ruled that
evidence of battered women syndrome is permissible at trials.
   All the cases reviewed involved women convicted of killing or
assaulting their mates before the March 7 decision.
   The new state law permits testimony on the syndrome, a
psychological state brought on by long-term abusive relationships
and which often leads to severe stress and low self-esteem, among
other conditions.
   Some of Celeste's decisions ran counter to recommendations of
the parole board. But he said he read each case at least twice and
consulted with court and other officials before he was convinced
they were victims.
   Celeste said the parole board does not cite the criteria it uses
in its decisions.

   Nepalese Christians celebrated the
Christmas season Friday with their first open service since reforms
swept away a strict Hindu tradition in the Himalayan nation.
   ``We had no chance to celebrate Christmas in the open before the
dawn of democracy,'' said Loknath Manaen, secretary of the Nepal
Bible Society.
   About 700 Christians gathered Friday for a three-hour public
worship meeting in the heart of Katmandu. Previously, they were
forced to worship secretly in unmarked halls and private homes.
   Last year, 14 Nepalese Christians were arrested for singing
carols at Patrang Bari in southeastern Nepal. All were sentenced to
six years in prison by the government, then a divine-right Hindu
monarchy.
   Following pro-democracy protests last spring, King Birendra was
reduced to a constitutional monarch and freedom of worship was
allowed.
   The jailed Christians were released in June under a general
amnesty by the new government.
   The National Bible Society estimates there are about 50,000
Christians in Nepal. About 90 percent of Nepal's 17 million people
are Hindus. Most of the rest are Moslems and Buddhists.
   Nepal's new constitution still forbids the conversion of Hindus
to other faiths.

   Winter arrived Friday on a sled of arctic air that slipped down
across the western two-thirds of the nation, from frosty Seattle to
snowy California to the deep-frozen Texas panhandle.
   The cold turned gasoline to gel in Wyoming, where temperatures
plunged to 50 degrees below zero. It snapped power transmission
lines, stopped Amtrak's ``Empire Builder'' in its snowy tracks and
gave California citrus growers the shivers.
   Low temperature records were tied or broken in many places,
including Denver, which matched a record at 21 below zero; Casper,
Wyo, where it was 41 below; and coastal Eureka, Calif., where it
was 27 above. In Medford, Ore., the record of 4 below zeo was 15
degrees below the old mark for the date.
   It was 2 below in Amarillo, Texas, and 6 above in Lubbock.
   The storm system has been blamed for at least 14 deaths since
Tuesday, in Washington, Iowa, Oregon, California, Oklahoma and
Mississippi. The most recent death was reported Friday afternoon in
Mississippi, where a twister knocked a tree into a house and killed
a man.
   The cold moved south briskly. In Page, Okla., a small town in
the Ouachita National Forest, temperatures dropped from 53 to 29 in
a span of 30 minutes Friday morning, forecaster Jim Purpura said.
   ``They have to join the rest of us,'' he said, referring to
portions of Oklahoma that had previously been spared the frigid
weather.
   In Wyoming, hundreds of Christmas travelers abandoned their
frozen vehicles. Among them were passengers aboard two Greyhound
buses stalled by the subzero temperatures.
   ``The problem is not the road conditions - the roads are pretty
dry,'' said Michelle Ryel, a dispatcher with the Wyoming Highway
Patrol in Cheyenne. ``The problem is the bitter cold is freezing up
these trucks. Their fuel is gelling.''
   Eight inches of snow fell at Gallup, N.M., where a recreation
center was converted to an overnight shelter for stranded
travelers. Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales issued an appeal to
citizens to help people found outdoors.
   ``Different people calling us report drunks laying out on the
sidewalks and that the snow is covering them,'' Gonzales said. ``I
wish they would help us by taking them inside, and we could pick
them up then.''
   Train travelers were delayed up to 24 hours when the cold
stalled Amtrak's ``Empire Builder'' from Seattle to Chicago. The
train that left Seattle on Tuesday arrived in Fargo, N.D., around
midnight Thursday - one day late.
   ``It's cold enough to crack (rails) when the ice builds up,''
Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said. ``Sometimes it just separates
the rails, but whether it actually cracks a rail or simply
separates a rail, you can't operate a train. You have to wait to
get a repair crew there.''
   Between 40 and 50 families in Pocatello, Idaho, were evacuated
from their homes when overnight temperatures that dipped to
17-below created ice jams that caused the nearby Portneuf River to
rise more than four feet in two hours.
   More than 3,000 homes in southern Oregon lost their natural gas
supply when pressure dropped in a pipeline that supplies the area.
Gas company officials said it could take days to restore gas to all
the households.
   The cold also apparently caused a water valve to rupture in the
Ogden, Utah City Mall Friday, sending icy water pouring into as
many as 20 stores.
   Thunderstorms and twisters swirled through Mississippi and
Louisiana afternoon, overturning a tractor-trailer rig, blowing
cars off the road, damaging buildings and injuring at least five
people.
   The cold caused power outages in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in
Arlee, St. Ignatius and Ravalli, Mont.
   The outages kept the Jackson Hole Ski Resort from opening. But
in general, the storm was a boon to the ski industry in the Rockies
and the Sierra Nevada.
   And while subzero temperatures, whipping winds and blowing snow
made life a little harder for some people, others took it in
stride.
   ``This is how it's supposed to be,'' said Kathy Walters of West
Des Moines, Iowa, as she prepared to go out into the 33-below wind
chill. ``It's Christmas. First comes ice, then snow.

   A group of sixth-grade students hoping to
forestall a war in the Middle East have gathered more than 7,000
signatures for petitions to send to President Bush and Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   ``We're old enough to know what's going on,'' said Mary Beth
Schultz, 11. ``We're old enough to be afraid.''
   The youngsters launched their drive about five weeks ago with
letters to 165 Roman Catholic schools statewide, said their
teacher, Pat Garcia.
   About half the schools responded with signatures from students
and teachers.
   The petitions were to be sent to Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr., R-Wis., with a request that copies be forwarded to the White
House and to Iraq's United Nations delegation.
   Iraqi troops invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. The United
Nations has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait
or risk military intervention.
   ``We urge President Bush and Saddam Hussein to step forward and
lead our world to peace,'' the petitions said.
   The children's solutions to the crisis included dividing oil
profits between Kuwait and Iraq and submitting the dispute to an
arbitrator.
   ``Maybe it will work out; I don't know,'' Adrianne Pauley, 12,
said. ``At least we tried.''

   MOSCOW - President Mikhail Gorbachev forged ahead with efforts
to revamp the government and increase his powers after Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze resigned, warning of a slide toward
dictatorship.
   The Fourth Congress of People's Deputies was scheduled to resume
discussion today on a Union Treaty that grants limited autonomy to
the governments of the 15 Soviet republics.
   But most of the republic leaders want even greater independence
from Moscow. The growing chaos in some areas has led a hard-line
faction of the Communist Party, including military leaders, to call
for a crackdown.
   Shevardnadze, 62, in his shocking resignation speech Thursday,
lamented the growing influence of lawmakers ``with colonels'
stripes'' and said the government was moving toward a dictatorship.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - U.S. officials are worried that the departure of
Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Soviet foreign minister will slow
progress in U.S.-Soviet relations and perhaps trigger further
disintegration of the central government in Moscow.
   ``This is not a very nice Christmas present from Moscow,'' said
one senior U.S. official who emerged Thursday from meetings at the
State Department to discuss Shevardnadze's resignation, which sent
shock waves through Moscow and Western capitals alike.
   Despite public reassurances that the resignation won't change
the course of superpower relations, there is private consternation
among leading official analysts and more open concern expressed by
experts outside the government.
   John D. Steinbruner, a Soviet specialist and director of foreign
policy studies at the Brookings Institution, called the move ``a
severe polarization of the Soviet domestic situation.''
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - While urging the Soviet Union to accelerate its
economic reform efforts, a study of the Soviet economy concludes
that massive amounts of Western aid would be wasted if offered now.
   The study, the most comprehensive look by the West at the
economic difficulties facing the Soviets, was being released
simultaneously today in Washington, London and Paris by the
agencies that undertook the five-month review.
   Officials in the Bush administration and international lending
institutions said the report recommends an infusion of technical
assistance to help the Soviets move to a market economy. At the
same time, they said, the study warns against massive amounts of
immediate Western aid on grounds the money would be wasted because
the Soviet economy is in so much disarray.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
report portrays a system that was even more backward than expected
and practically paralyzed in its stumbling efforts to implement the
restructuring program of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - President Bush says Iraq's Saddam Hussein does not
understand the military threat he faces in the Persian Gulf and
must be made to realize his country is going to lose badly if it
comes to war.
   ``If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass
kicked,'' Bush was quoted as telling lawmakers Thursday.
   However, some congressional leaders expressed concern about the
fallout from fighting.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, just back from the
Middle East, said he and members of his group detected
``considerable support among the masses'' in Arab countries for
Saddam.
   ---&equals;
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - If the United States attacks Iraq for
refusing to leave Kuwait, the assault could begin with a massive
air strike - followed by a short pause to give Saddam Hussein a
chance to surrender, military analysts say.
   This scenario gained credence this week as U.S. military
officials conceded that some vital American ground forces will not
be ready for combat by the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for the
Iraqi leader to withdraw his troops from Kuwait or face attack.
   The likelihood of starting with air strikes has been discussed
for some time by military officials and others who believe the
United States - because of its long-term political interests in the
region - must keep damage to Iraq to a minimum.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are in Saudi Arabia assessing the U.S.
deployment. They were heading later today to the north for
pre-Christmas meetings with American troops stationed in the Saudi
desert.
   ---&equals;
   GARY, Ind. - A rash of seven shotgun killings is scaring people
into carrying guns or staying indoors at night as police try to nab
the killer before another attack.
   Gun sales are skyrocketing in the largely blue-collar area of
northwest Indiana after the slayings within a 20-mile radius since
late October.
   At Jack's Gun Shop in Burns Harbor sales of firearms and
ammunition have jumped fivefold since last week, owner Jack Batz
said Thursday.
   ``We saw a big increase because people realize these are
senseless killings,'' Batz said.
   ---&equals;
   NEW YORK - They'll still need their parents' permission for
field trips, but teen-agers in the nation's largest school system
could get condoms next year simply by asking.
   Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez believes it's a matter of
life - or death from AIDS. New York City is home to about 3 percent
of the nation's 13- to 21-year-olds, but it has 20 percent of all
AIDS cases in that age group.
   ``We are sitting on a time bomb,'' Fernandez said.
   If the Board of Education approves Fernandez's proposal next
month, condoms would be available on request as early as next
spring at 120 schools that enroll 261,000 students.
   ---&equals;
   UNITED NATIONS - Jewish groups are lambasting Washington for
supporting a Security Council resolution that condemns Israel's
deportation of Palestinians, and Israel says it will ``not
accommodate'' the United Nations.
   By joining in the 15-0 council vote Thursday, the United States
managed to maintain crucial unity with its Arab allies in the
Persian Gulf crisis as the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline approaches for
Iraq to pull out of Kuwait or face possible war.
   At the same time, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering avoided
linkage of the Palestinian issue to efforts to resolve the gulf
crisis, as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been demanding.
   The resolution asks signatories of the Fourth Geneva Convention
to ``ensure respect by Israel ... for its obligations'' under the
convention.
   ---&equals;
   ARCTIC VILLAGE, Alaska - On a C-130 Hercules transport plane
headed north across the Arctic Circle, Air Force Sgt. Carl Warrings
donned his Santa suit and started practicing his ``Ho, ho, ho.''
   A half-hour later, he and 1,500 pounds of Christmas presents -
including a community washing machine - were lowered onto the
frozen tundra outside this Gwich'in Indian village.
   A few dozen small children, bundled in furs and snowsuits,
waited with their parents. It was 45 degrees below zero - warmer
than it's been here all month.
   ``This is good. Usually when Santa comes it's really cold,''
said Kias Peter, the village's traditional chief.

   Soviet army units enforcing the
Kremlin view of life are not new to East Europeans, but the next
Soviet invaders may be civilians trying to escape it.
   A possible mass influx of Soviet citizens fleeing economic chaos
and ethnic strife at home has Eastern Europe, which has its own
economic problems, balancing empty pockets against humanitarian
ideals.
   ``A `poverty wall' must not take the place of the Iron
Curtain,'' Prime Minister Jozsef Antall of Hungary said recently.
   Six months ago, the Soviet government promised to ease travel
restrictions, but an emigration law is hung up in the Supreme
Soviet legislature. No one can say when the reforms will come.
   Similarly, no one knows how many people will leave when new
legislation takes effect. Estimates range from the 1990 total of
400,000 refugees to 5 million.
   Lev Lyubimov of the Soviet Institute of the World Economy and
International Relations said currency restrictions and technical
limitations on printing passports and visas probably would keep the
number of emigres at about the current level.
   Economic and social reforms also might keep Soviets at home, he
said.
   Soviet troops went into Hungary to stop a popular uprising in
1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the ``Prague Spring''
liberalization. They began leaving only only after peaceful
revolutions a year ago.
   The possible invasion of refugees coincides with Eastern
Europe's struggle to transform itself from communism to capitalism.
   Soviet emigration was discussed at a 34-nation summit in Paris
in November. Recent food aid to the Soviet Union from Western
nations is at least partially aimed at encourging its people to
stay home.
   East European officials question whether the West is willing to
accept its share of Soviet refugees. They fear most of the Soviets
determined to emigrate will land in their countries.
   Poland cannot afford to take Soviet emigres, but will not turn
them away, said Barbara Rozycka, a Polish official who attended a
conference near Prague recently on prospects for Soviet emigration.
   ``We don't have enough for our own people, but it's not a
question because it doesn't depend on economics, but humanitarian
concerns,'' she said. ``The question for Poland is, `How will the
Soviet Union disintegrate?' because we're sure it will happen. .. .
Poland wants to see a peaceful disintegration.''
   Within the Soviet Union, at least 600,000 people in the 15
Soviet republics already are thought to be refugees from ethnic
violence. Many may want to leave if a new emigration law allows it.
   Soviet citizens have not needed visas to travel to Eastern
Europe because of the close ties built during the communist years
and because the Soviet Union restricted the right to travel.
   Former Soviet-bloc nations are loathe to impose visa
requirements, but also worry about laying themselves open to
greater economic strain.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia, for instance, are considering
whether they should require Soviets to have a minimum amount of
foreign currency when they arrive, and also may strengthen border
patrols.
   Currency regulations could stop many Soviets because the ruble,
nearly worthless in its own country, cannot be converted abroad. In
March, Soviet authorities forbade citizens to export items that
might be used for trading, ranging from honey and canned fish to
electric wire.
   ``We think the presence of police and soldiers at the border
would deter many'' Soviets from trying to cross illegally into
Eastern Europe, said Martin Friedman of the Czechoslovak Interior
Ministry.
   Czechoslovakia expects to accept about 12,000 refugees annually
under a new law offering asylum to those facing political, racial
or religious persecution.
   Poland also can expect a large influx. Two million people of
Polish origin live in the Soviet Union, mostly in neighboring
Ukraine, Byelorussia and Lithuania, Ms. Rozycka said.
   Hungary is concerned about 200,000 ethnic Hungarians who live on
the Soviet side of the 100-mile border and has committed itself to
keeping the frontier open.
   For Romania, the situation is more confused. Nationalists on
both sides of the Prut River border want the Soviet republic of
Moldavia, annexed 50 years ago, to rejoin Romania.
   More than 100 ethnic groups are included in the Soviet
population of 300 million.
   Some Soviets already are emigrating to Eastern Europe.
   Judit Toth, head of the Hungarian Interior Ministry's Refugee
Affairs Department, said 55 applied for refugee status in September
and 37 in October. Officials are trying to decide whether to return
a man who swam the Tisza River border to Hungary.
   Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski of Poland said in November
that tens of thousands of Soviets had overstayed their tourist
visits.

<HEAD>Christmas Eve In Hollywood: Real Tinsel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is sort of a tradition for Christmas Eve
columns to start with phrases like, ``Twas the night before
Christmas ...'' But this one concerns the first Hollywood Christmas
of Martin Mull.
   Mull, actor, guitarist, and an artist whose heart belongs to
Dada, was raised in North Ridgeville, Ohio. There, an old-fashioned
Christmas meant lots of snow and frozen car radiators and guys full
of goodwill, shots and beer.
   His first old-fashioned Hollywood Christmas, in 1975, was
somewhat different.
   ``The hardest adjustment was being able to get into the
Christmas spirit when it's 85 degrees, the air is hanging like pea
soup and there are palm trees with lights on them,'' he said.
   He saw his first Hollywood Christmas parade, full of antique
celebrities, chauffeur-driven marching bands, antique cars, and
tiny people claiming to have been in a 950 CBS series, ``Kuda Bux,
Hindu Mystic.''
   ``I watched from a distance of about 15 feet - and I was seeing
it on our TV set - and I realized that is the closest I ever want
to get to halftime at the Orange Bowl.''
   And most every shopping-mall Santa Claus had a Screen Actors
Guild card.
   ``Oh, yes. If you sat in their lap, they'd tell you what THEY
want. They'd say, `Listen, if you know anybody at Paramount, I've
got a script.' Also, `I don't really do this. I'm not Santa.'
Really shattered my bubble.''
   He survived all this. He went on to play the evil Garth Gimble
of Norman Lear's ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,'' and then Garth's
twin, Barth, host of the best talk show ever, ``America 2-Night,''
now in reruns on cable.
   That started him on his way, to fine films like ``Serial,'' to
comedy albums, two of them nominated for Grammy awards, and to
various cable specials, among them his acclaimed ``The History of
White People in America.''
   Alas, things did not go well for his first CBS sitcom, a 1984
effort called ``Domestic Life.'' It expired quickly. His second,
``His &amp; Hers,'' another domestic sitcom, had an even shorter life
on CBS last season.
   No matter. He's working on a third, ``Family Dog,'' an animated
sitcom about the life and times of a nameless dog and the family
that lives with him. The show isn't yet scheduled for CBS'
prime-time roster.
   Mull is aware that some may consider it CBS' reply to Fox's
``The Simpsons,'' although this is not so. In his show, ``the focus
is on a dumb animal, with the accent on dumb.''
   In the show, Mull is the voice of ``Dad,'' the head of the clan,
with Molly Cheek as the mother of their two kids. It's the first
time he has been a voice in a cartoon series. He considers it a
good deal.
   ``I've had some lousy experiences in television ... but this one
is a treat,'' he said. ``I don't have to shave. I don't even have
to bathe, actually. I do it only out of courtesy to Molly.''
   Mull spoke by phone from his home near Santa Monica, Calif., a
home he said contained all the old-fashioned Christmas things,
including icy frost spray-painted on the window corners.
   He, his wife, Wendy, a composer, and their 5-year-old daughter,
Maggie Rose, plan to spend Christmas quietly.
   Same goes for New Year's Eve, even if it is the custom during
New Year's Eve in Hollywood to go to New Wave clubs, drink a lot of
champagne and, as the new year arrives, holler, ``I'M FAABULOUS!
I`M FAABULOUS!''
   You won't find that at the Mull manse. He doesn't drink
nowadays, he says. And he'll stay at home, where there'll be no
shouts and wild cries.
   ``We tend to celebrate New Year's at 10 p.m.,'' he said.
``Because, hey, tomorrow's another day. You've got to get up and
the kid gets up early. Besides, I like to think I have a two-hour
jump on everyone else in town.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television...
   REASON NO. 397 TO CONTINUE BREATHING IN 1991: There will be
another, yes, another awards show added to a list so crowded that
there is talk of holding an awards show to honor achievement in
award shows. Until then, CBS' new ``The Movie Awards'' telecast
must suffice. Co-hosted by Kirstie Alley and Robert Townsend, it
will be broadcast live on Jan. 30 from Universal City. It will
honor movies and actors considered really neat by filmgoers voting
in 3,000 theaters. The Big Vote will be held on Jan. 5.

   The girl, hair neatly coiffed, wore a petite pearl
choker by Mitsukoshi, black velvet dress by Renoma and white lace
gloves. Her escort, in top hat, sported a double-breasted tux by
abs d'absorba.
   Ready for the prom? Not quite. That's still years away for the
two pint-size models photographed for a magazine in outfits worth
more than $3,500.
   The Japanese penchant for designer brands and other luxury goods
has brought some tots into the world of high fashion.
   Japan's ultraperfectionist parents and doting grandparents have
more money than ever, and fewer children to spend it on. The
average number of children per family has dropped from about five
in 1945 to 1.5 in 1989.
   ``There are six pockets - the two sets of grandparents and the
parents - who can be counted on to spend money on every child,''
said Toshiro Niizaki, planning director for Seibu department
store's children's section in Tokyo.
   Highly competitive department stores have encouraged the trend
by building special kids sections stocked with designer goods.
   Sunday department store outings and the custom among
status-conscious Japanese of giving expensive gifts have done
wonders for the boom in kiddy luxury goods.
   When special occasions come up for youngsters, it often is the
grandparents who foot the bill for the gold-threaded silk kimonos
that have become de rigueur for ritual shrine visits.
   The visits start with the 100-day-old child's first blessing. A
kimono worn only for that excursion can cost well over $1,000.
Subsequent visits during a girl's third and seventh year and a
boy's fifth require new kimonos or Western suits.
   Trend watchers say young parents fond of sports cars, fur coats
and diamond rings are willing accomplices.
   ``When parents themselves are wearing designer clothes, they
want their kids to have things that are just as nice,'' said
Niizaki, a father of two.
   ``Young mothers are especially fashion conscious, since they
grew up during a `fashion era' introduced by teen magazines in the
1970s,'' said Hideo Takayama, director of the Children's Survey
Research Institute in Tokyo.
   ``They've got the tiresome habit of comparing themselves and
their children with others. They want their kids to have the best
so everyone will see their kids as being good,'' he said.
   Their elite tastes aren't confined to fashion:
   -Disco parties for tots and their mothers are a hit in the
western city of Osaka. A 24-year-old mother at one of them with her
year-old daughter told a popular weekly magazine she spent about
100,000 yen ($750) a month on the child's clothing and
entertainment.
   -Family gourmet dinners to commemorate special occasions, at up
to $450 for a family of four, are popular at major hotels.
   -Travel agents say six-day family tours to Hawaii and Guam,
complete with baby sitter and sometimes a doctor, are fully booked
at $2,500 and up.
   To get their children into the best schools possible, parents
send toddlers as young as 1 to preschools.
   One such institution, run by Tokyo's Seiwa Education Co., picks
up and returns tots to their homes or their mothers' offices in
luxury cars.
   School officials say about 50 children are on the waiting list
for 120 places. Entrance fees range up to $3,750 and monthly fees
to $2,200.
   Parents say the ultraexpensive clothes are only brought out for
special occasions, which makes spending $1,300 for a ministrand of
pearls or more than $450 for a tiny three-piece woolen suit and
suspenders even more puzzling.
   ``At our school, we require the children to wear clothes that
can get dirty and are easy to play in,'' said Taeko Fukuda, a
nursery school teacher. ``I think it's very strange to buy such
expensive clothes for fast-growing children.''
   Some people are worried by the trend.
   ``In the past, we didn't believe in being so extravagant. We
thought it would make children weak. Today, some mothers seem to
view their children as accessories, rather than real people,'' said
Takako Shinagawa, a child psychologist and grandmother.
   Ms. Shinagawa said it's difficult to avoid spoiling
grandchildren, however, and added: ``There must be some place with
decent prices, but I'm too old to go looking for it.''
   Niizaki of the Seibu department store said he does not favor
buying luxury clothes for children, even though his department's
sales have increased up to 20 percent a year.
   ``We try not to buy too much,'' he said of his own family. ``You
have to teach kids how to put up with waiting. You can't just give
them everything they want right away.''

<TEXT>
   After decades of focusing on work and building
the economy, Singapore is becoming serious about having fun.
   Nothing frivolous, of course, but Goh Chok Tong, the new prime
minister, has promised a lighter approach. Goh, 49, took over when
Lee Kuan Yew stepped aside last month after 31 authoritarian years.
   Lee made no excuses for the lack of municipal merriment in his
clean, prosperous city-state, but approved carefully patrolled
street festivals beginning two years ago. They have become
institutionalized, with part of one main street closed an evening
each month for a mass party.
   The biggest of these bashes attract about 250,000 people from a
population of only 2.7 million.
   ``We have got to find new ways of expressing ourselves, and this
is not only harmless, it may well do us good,'' Lee acknowledged.
   Singapore also has discovered fun is good for business.
   ``It is not just to have fun, it is also because fun products
sell better,'' George Yeo said. ``To create fun products, we need
fun people, fun events and fun places.''
   Yeo recently was appointed acting Cabinet minister in charge of
information and the arts.
   ``It may seem odd, but we have to pursue this subject of fun
very seriously if we want to stay competitive in the 21st
century,'' he said. Life should be effervescent, Yeo declared, with
``more bubbles in the Singapore champagne.''
   Creative services will become very important in economic
development and the right milieu is needed to attract creative
people, Yeo said: ``In a paradoxical way, fun is serious
business.''
   In trying to recapture the zest of old Singapore for tourists
who complain the nightlife is boring, the government is rebuilding
Bugis Street.
   A raffish neighborhood that contrasted with the rest of this
squeaky clean place, Bugis Street attracted drunken soldiers and
sailors, transsexuals and other all-night revelers. It was
bulldozed out of existence five years ago to make way for a subway
station.
   For decades, there was nothing remotely like it in Singapore.
The ambience included hundreds of food stalls, touts and small-time
con artists, souvenir peddlers, palm readers and pimps.
   Bugis Street became naturally seedy over the years, but the copy
is a $7.2 million-project sanctioned by the Tourist Promotion
Board.
   In addition to encouraging more fun, officials are determined to
shed the country's reputation as a cultural desert and help
citizens develop three-dimensional personalities. The new prime
minister wants them to be educated, compassionate, gracious and
socially confident.
   The 3-D Singaporean is to be fully operational and contributing
to a ``culturally vibrant society'' by 1999, by the government's
timetable.
   Since that target was set six years ago, millions of dollars
have been provided for the arts, spending on a scale unprecedented
in the 25 years since independence from Britain.
   By trying to generate more fun, younger political leaders hope
to attract a new generation, said Chan Heng See, Singapore's U.N.
ambassador. Younger voters did not readily accept the idea of a
successful, efficient, hard-working, boring society of conformist,
rigid, overly disciplined people.
   ``Singapore should hang loose a little,'' Ms. Chan said, ``but I
think if we start talking of the politics of fun, we immediately
destroy the spontaneity of what we are trying to create.''

<HEAD>Clean Air Act Creates Uncertain Future for Coal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The coal industry, always battered by
economic and labor uncertainties, enters the new year under the
cloud of the Clean Air Act of 1990, which could devastate the
nation's high-sulfur mines at first and mean trouble for all mines
later.
   ``It's going to hurt some people. It's going to shift the market
maybe, and we don't know how,'' said David Branand, director of
environmental affairs for the National Coal Association.
   ``Overall, unfortunately, in the long-term, I believe the Clean
Air Act is going to be negative for the coal industry in general,
basically because of caps or restrictions on emissions,'' said Gary
White, president of the West Virginia Coal Association.
   The Clean Air Act, which became law Nov. 15, restricts sulfur
dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, considered the
leading cause of acid rain.
   Those plants, primarily in the Midwest and Ohio Valley, must cut
sulfur dioxide emissions by half, or 9 million tons annually, in
the next decade.
   The restrictions, which take effect in 1995 and tighten in 2000,
essentially give power plants that now burn high-sulfur coal three
options:
   -They can install scrubbers at a cost of up to $100 million
each, which would eliminate up to 90 percent of the sulfur
emissions and allow them to continue burning high-sulfur coal;
   -They can switch to lower-sulfur coal and pay generally higher
transportation costs;
   -Or they can trade or sell pollution allowances, permitting some
plants to exceed standards to the extent other plants come in under
the limits.
   ``So much of it depends on what the utilities are going to do,
and they're in a state of uncertainty,'' Branand said. Nonetheless,
utility officials must decide soon which route they will take.
   ``If you're talking about installing scrubbers, not only are you
talking about a major financial investment, you're talking about a
major construction effort to get them installed,'' White said.
   West Virginia presents a microcosm of the challenges the Clean
Air Act poses for the coal industry.
   The state's high-sulfur northern coal fields stand to lose
business because of pollution restrictions.
   At the same time, the state's low-sulfur southern coal fields
are getting ready for a boom.
   White said he hopes for expansion in the southern coal fields
and a minimum loss in the northern mines. But he's more pessimistic
about the industry's long-term health, primarily because the law
will make it to expensive to build ne coal-fired power plants.
   The key to meeting the new clean air standards lies in the
sulfur content of coal and its ability to produce energy rated in
British thermal units, or Btu, said John Randolph, director of the
Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research.
   Wyoming, Kentucky and West Virginia produce more than half the
nation's coal. Coal with a sulfur content of 0.6 percent or less
makes up 44 percent of the known reserves in Wyoming, 16 percent in
Kentucky and 37 percent in West Virginia.
   But the coal in Kentucky and West Virginia generally is more
efficient than that in Wyoming, Randolph said.
   The average central Appalachian coal produces 12,500 Btu per
pound, while Wyoming coal can produce as little as 10,000 Btu per
pound.
   By 1995, power plants must limit sulfur dioxide emissions to 2.5
pounds per million Btu. Central Appalachian coal with about 1.6
percent sulfur content will meet the new standards, Randolph said.
   By 2000, sulfur dioxide emissions will be limited to 1.2 pounds
per million Btu, so central Appalachian coal would have to have a
sulfur content of 0.75 percent or less, he said.
   In both cases, Western coal would have to be lower in sulfur
content to make up for the shortfall in Btu.
   But while the Western coal is less efficient than Appalachian
coal and costs more to transport to the Midwestern power plants
that need it, it also is cheaper to produce, industry experts said.
   In the past year, Huntington-based Ashland Coal Inc. has spent
$180 million to buy two companies with major low-sulfur reserves:
Mingo Logan Coal Co. in southern West Virginia and Pikeville,
Ky.-based Coal Mac Inc.
   ``We believe Ashland Coal is going to be benefited from the
Clean Air Act amendments,'' said Vice President David Todd. We feel
optimistic about that.
   ``Quantifying that is where the uncertainty is.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homosexuality remains illegal in the Soviet Union
after five years of political reform, and attempts to start a gay
liberation movement have been denounced by the press with a venom
reminiscent of another era.
   Religion, pornography, gambling and political freethinking, once
grievous sins against communist society, flourish under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but homosexuality has stayed underground, one
of the last taboos.
   In the past year, a few dozen Soviet gays and lesbians have
begun a campaign to get homosexuality legalized and increase social
tolerance.
   They have achieved some successes, including launching the
country's first homosexual newspaper, but Soviet homosexuals say
they also have been beaten by youth gangs in recent months and
forced by police to undergo blood tests for AIDS.
   ``There is no real gay liberation movement here, and I am very
skeptical there will be one,'' said Dmitri, 33, a scientist. Like
other homosexuals interviewed, he asked to be identified only by
his first name.
   ``I am absolutely sure that if they announced a rally ... few
people would turn out,'' he said. ``I personally wouldn't. They
would photograph us, and that could lead to problems at work, maybe
even getting fired.''
   On warm evenings, gay men often gather outside the Bolshoi
Theater, home of the renowned ballet.
   When the weather turns raw, they walk around the block to the
Sadko Cafe for Hungarian wine, salted fish and mushrooms cooked in
sour cream.
   Sadko has more charm than utilitarian Soviet cafes, and one
other advantage: privacy. Its widely spaced tables allow discreet
conversation, and lamps reflect dim light onto a vaulted ceiling.
   The ``golubye'' - literally ``light blue ones,'' Russian slang
for homosexuals - are careful to leave in threes and fours.
   ``It's not a good idea to walk out of here alone, because you
can never tell who's waiting around the corner with a stick and a
taste for blood,'' said Serezha, 24.
   Gay activists say youth gangs beat up homosexuals about once a
month, and that the attacks rarely are reported to the police
because victims don't want to call attention to themselves.
   Whatever the threat of teen-age toughs lurking outside, the
Sadko at least provides a meeting place for the small number -
believed fewer than 250 - of open homosexuals in Moscow, a city of
9 million people.
   Conditions are said to be worse outside the capital and other
major cities.
   ``In small towns, homosexuals are always visible,'' said Dmitri,
the scientist. ``They have no place to gather and no place to
hide.''
   Activists said only a few men had been prosecuted in recent
years for homosexual acts between consenting adults and all the
cases were in provincial towns.
   ``There is no reason to believe homosexuality is any less common
in the Soviet Union than anywhere else on earth,'' said Vladimir
Shakhidshanian. ``It just meets less public acceptance here.''
   Shakhidshanian, 50, is the author of a forthcoming book about
sex called ``1,001 Questions About THAT.'' The avuncular Armenian
dispenses advice about sex in newspapers and on television.
   During an interview in his cluttered office, he riffled through
some of the 8,000 letters he has received from viewers, including
many gays and lesbians.
   Soviet homosexuals ``suffer loneliness, shame and discomfort in
their private lives, and ignorance, prejudice and persecution in
society,'' he said.
   He said he knew of no Soviet polls on attitudes toward
homosexuality. Shakhidshanian said his letters and interviews
indicated that tolerance of homosexuality rose in the early 1980s,
under Western influence.
   ``Then came AIDS,'' he said, ``and turned public opinion
strongly against homosexuals again.''
   According to official statistics, 565 Soviet citizens, including
74 homosexuals, are infected with HIV, the AIDS virus.
   The leading causes of the spread of AIDS in the Soviet Union are
medical mistakes - including reuse of infected syringes - and
heterosexual relations, said Irina Yeremova, an epidemiologist.
   ``Homosexuals often are blamed,'' she said.
   The law against homosexuality, dating from the 1930s, sometimes
has been used for political purposes, as in the case of the late
Sergei Paradzhanov, an Armenian film maker imprisoned in 1972-78.
He was convicted of homosexuality, but his real crime was signing a
ltter demanding the release of Ukrainian dissidents.
   Anatoly Sobchak, a former law professor who now is mayor of
Leningrad and a member of the national legislature, said he
believes the statute will be removed when a new criminal code is
adopted in 1991.
   Technically, it prohibits only male homosexuality, not
lesbianism. But lesbians are active in the nascent homosexual
rights movement.
   ``We suffer from the same kind of social intolerance, the same
fear of being fired under some pretext, the same desire to live
freely,'' said Mila, 33.
   The movement's leading organization, formed in Moscow in October
1989, is the Association of Sexuality Minorities, which publishes
Tema, or Theme, the first Soviet gay and lesbian newspaper.
   To protect identities, the association keeps no formal
membership roll. Activists said it has only 20 to 25 regular
participants, but many more supporters.
   The first three issues of the newspaper, distributed in
February, July and November, contained articles on such topics as
gay cinema, homosexuality in Russian history.
   In a scathing article printed by leading newspapers Nov. 15, the
government Tass news agency accused the group of harboring not only
``primitive'' homosexuals, but ``necrophiliacs, pedophiles and
zoophiles.''
   ``Where can you find a fresh corpse to excite a necrophiliac?
How much does it cost to have sex with a baby? Why doesn't Moscow
have official places for men to entertain themselves with little
boys, and girls with girls? For only two rubles, Tema provides its
readers with the answers to these and other nasty questions,'' Tass
said.
   Roman Kalinin, Tema's 24-year-old editor, denied the paper had
published such information. Tass ``knew perfectly well it was
untrue,'' he said.
   In addition to publishing Tema, the Association of Sexual
Minorities collects information on civil rights violations.
   It reported in September that police and soldiers in the Black
Sea resort of Sochi raided a gay cafe and used billy clubs to force
suspected homosexuals into a bus. The men were driven to a
hospital, where doctors were ordered to test their blood for AIDS,
the association said.
   Activists said Western gay and lesbian groups so far have
contributed several typewriters, a small amount of money - under
$1,000 - and 7,000 condoms to the association.
   Kalinin, who spent November in the United States meeting with
homosexual groups at the invitation of the U.S.-based International
Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, said he believes more aid
will be coming.
   Already, he said, international activists have planned a ``gay
parade'' through Red Square for the summer of 1991.

<HEAD>Network of Rocketing Trains Spreads Across Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The historic linkup of a tunnel under the English
Channel is only one step in a larger plan to connect the great
cities of Europe with a network of superfast trains.
   Rail planners envision sleek trains rocketing through the French
Alps, across German plains and, of course, under the channel.
   On board, they hope, will be travelers fed up with Europe's
congested airports and highways. By 2010, they could be riding from
Madrid to Frankfurt in less than 10 hours, compared to nearly 24
hours now.
   ``Train will soon allow what only plane made possible,''
predicts Karel van Miert, the European Community's transport
commissioner.
   He recently introduced an EC plan to create a $205 billion
Western European high-speed network over 20 years. The 15,500 miles
of electrified track would carry trains running at 120 to 200 mph.
   The channel tunnel, which linked up in early December, will join
London and Paris with a 3{-hour train ride in 1993. It will enable
a London banker, for example, to hop a train to Brussels,
Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan or dozens of other cities.
   Environmental worries, ethnic squabbles and high construction
costs could derail parts of the project. Finanbody.
   ``When it will really be done, I don't know,'' said Hughes
Corbeau, a rail planner for the French Transport Ministry. ``It's
going to cost a lot, and demands concerted efforts from public
powers.''
   High-speed rail systems - minimum speed 120 mph - already built
or under construction in Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and France
form the core of the proposed network.
   Also foreseen are new high-speed systems or linkups by rail or
ferry in Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland and Yugoslavia.
   The technological star and pacesetter for high-speed rail is the
chisel-nosed French TGV, or ``train a grande vitesse.''
   TGVs went into operation between Paris and Lyon in 1981, racing
along at 174 mph. They halved the rail time between France's two
leading economic centers to two hours, and boosted ridership
between Paris and southeast France from 12.2 million to 22.1
million in nine years.
   Julian Andriao, 45, a chemistry professor from Lyon, is a
regular rider. He said the train may be a bit slower than an
airplane, but makes up for it by saving trips to airports and
waiting at check-in lines.
   ``I came here for a professional meeting this morning,'' he said
on a Paris train platform. ``I'll be home in time for dinner with
my family.''
   France expanded the TGV network last year with a second
generation of more powerful trains running east-west. They cruise
at 186 mph, but one engine set a world rail speed record of 318
mph.
   The TGV runs at high speed only on special track. On the 3{-hour
trip from Paris to Geneva, it slows to 125 mph on conventional
track after Lyon.
   Railway directors hope high-speed trains can win back airline
travelers on trips of 600 miles or less. Hours-long airport delays
are increasing, especially at London, Paris and Frankfurt.
   Transport studies show European air traffic increased 56 percent
from 1975 to 1986 and could double by 2000. On the Paris-Lyon run,
air traffic fell to 1972 levels after the TGV began operating.
   The complete train network will not be easy to accomplish, if
the planned hookup of London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and
Cologne serves as any example.
   It already has intergovernmental approval and the route lies
over flat terrain, so it should be among the easiest to build.
However:
   -Britain refuses to lay special TGV track in the lush, highly
populated countryside between London and the channel tunnel, adding
30 minutes to the trip.
   -Regions of Flemish and French speakers in bilingual Belgium are
squabbling over who will get the special track and thus reap the
most economic benefit.
   -In the Netherlands, the shortage of dry land makes it
impossible to lay the long straightaways TGVs need to reach full
speed.
   The French Transport Ministry had hoped the line would be
operational by 1995. Its most optimistic estimate now is 1998.

<HEAD>Former Game Ranger is `Father' To All Creatures Great and Small</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHIPANGALI, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foster father Viv Wilson is fond of
his orphans even if they do growl and grunt, snarl and snap, hiss
and hoot.
   One even bit off a finger.
   The 58-year-old former game ranger's charges are lions, hyenas,
baboons, crocodiles, snakes and hundreds of birds common to the
African bush.
   ``It's not a zoo, and it's not for financial gain,'' said
Wilson, a native South African who set up the home in 1973.
   ``It's simply a private sanctuary for orphaned, abandoned,
confiscated or injured wild animals that, reared in captivity,
can't safely be returned to the wilds.''
   Chipangali Wildlife Orphanage realizes a dream Wilson had
nurtured since working as a game ranger for the British colonial
government in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia.
   The body of a newborn kudu calf, clubbed to death by a native
hunter who also shot its mother, begot Wilson's ambition.
   He and the hunter met in the brush-studded Chipangali region of
eastern Zambia, heavily infested by trypanosomiasis - a disease
borne by tsetse files that can be fatal to man and beast.
   Wilson recalled asking the hunter why he killed the calf. The
hunter replied he was only doing his job, killing animals of some
species as part of the government's anti-tsetse fly operation.
   ``I knew he was right,'' said Wilson. ``But I also thought
something was awfully wrong.''
   When Zambia achieved independence in 1964, Wilson moved to
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where he was offered a good job in its game
department.
   Nine years later, Wilson founded Chipangali, 15 mies south of
Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, with savings and sponsorships.
   For Wilson, his wife Paddy and their two sons, home was a small
thatched roof house and work was tending a few animals in a cluster
of pens.
   This was the beginning of the seven-year war waged by guerrillas
against white supremacy. It ended in 1980 with independence under
President Robert Mugabe.
   ``We weren't touched by the war, and if guerrillas were roaming
around here, I never saw them,'' said Wilson. ``But we did get
quite a few soldiers popping in to drop off pets, mainly monkeys,
they'd tired of.''
   People continue to deliver animals to Wilson's care. Today,
Chipangali is a honeycomb of more than 70 large enclosures and
aviaries for ``The Orphans of the Wild,'' the title of a book by
Wilson published in 1977.
   A labyrinth of pebbled paths bordered by gardens of native
trees, plants and cactuses lead visitors to Wilson's waifs.
   ``We've strived to make the setting as naturally African as we
can, both for the animals and for people who come to see them,''
Wilson said.
   His family still lives beneath the thatch-roofed house flanked
by enclosures for lions, leopards and monkeys.
   About 20,000 people stroll around Chipangali's 10 acres each
year, a third of them schoolchildren who are allowed to visit free
of charge. Adults pay the equivalent of $2.
   ``We encourage the kids,'' said Wilson, who serves as manager
for a trust fund set up to bankroll the orphanage. ``Africans
brought up in the rural areas fully understand wildlife because
it's all around them. ... But millions of Africans born in cities
and towns have never seen a lion, a leopard or a snake.''
   Urban children, he said, ``have lost contact with nature. Here,
we take them back to the wild.''
   The $10,000 needed monthly for Chipangali's upkeep comes from
gate receipts, sales of a wildlife calendar, the orphanage's
restaurant and fund-raising events such as horseracing.
   Scores of sponsors, many of them foreigners, adopt animals and
send checks as foster parents.
   ``We still battle,'' said Wilson, who launched Chipangali on
$400 a month. ``We can never close, so we must cut our cloth to
suit our income.''
   Wilson, who as a game ranger survived charges by rhinoceros and
bites from poisonous snakes, has had few problems from his
creatures.
   A lion chomped off one of his fingers, a visiting schoolboy was
slightly injured by a leopard and some of his 40 employees have
been bitten by monkeys.
   Besides running the orphanage, Wilson has authored three
wildlife books, helped produce a 25-episode program for television
and written some 60 research papers on African snakes, animals and
birds.
   He was commissioned by the Geneva-based International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources to study ways to
prevent the extinction of the jentink's duiker antelope of Liberia,
and won the 1987 Rolex Spirit of Enterprise award for his work
there.
   In June, he was among 500 people worldwide honored by the United
Nations for environmental achievements.
   Wilson left Liberia in March just before the outbreak of civil
war. He fears the few surviving duiker were destroyed in the
conflict.
   ``That's my next concern,' ' he said. ``As soon as things are
settled down I'll go back to see for myself.''

   Cheyenne Vallance-Kirk is celebrating her
first Christmas with a sparkling tree, new toys and a loving
family. She has everything a baby girl should have - except her
mommy.
   Hollie Vallance is a soldier in Saudi Arabia, waiting for a
possible war, wondering about the baby she left behind this summer,
a 7-week-old bundle of sweetness, now being cuddled and cared for
by her daddy.
   ``It comes pretty naturally,'' says Anthony Kirk, heating a
bottle while cradling 5{-month-old Cheyenne in his arms. ``The
baby's teaching me. If you're not doing something right, she'll
scream and holler. You've got to figure out what to do.''
   ``He's done a remarkable job,'' boasts mother-in-law Sharon
Vallance. ``You can just tell she's a real happy baby and that just
shows to me that a baby's being well taken care of. ... You know
that things are right.''
   Kirk is among thousands of Army spouses whose lives have been
turned around by Operation Desert Shield, a military operation in
which roles are reversed for many families. Moms are toting guns
and cleaning tanks in the Persian Gulf, while dads are hauling
groceries and washing clothes at home.
   The separation creates a special strain and sadness in the
Christmas season.
   ``None of us can really get in the holiday mood,'' says Mrs.
Vallance. ``It's been real hard just to get the tree and decorate
it. ... I think it's real hard (Hollie) missing Cheyenne's first
Christmas.''
   Still, it will be a special day for baby Cheyenne, with gifts of
clothes, quilts, sing-along toys, rattles and a little mirror for
her crib. She'll have all the joy but none of the emptiness and
fear her family shares.
   ``We're all scared to death if something happens over there,
what she'll be doing and where she'll be at,'' Mrs. Vallance says
of her daughter.
   Kirk, 27, often says he wishes he could trade places with his
wife.
   ``I wouldn't have to worry about Hollie,'' he says. ``I just
feel the baby needs her mother more than a father.''
   But Cheyenne has been getting plenty of parenting since Spec. 4
Hollie Vallance, a 22-year-old medic, kissed her baby goodbye last
August as the Army's 197th Infantry Brigade pulled out from Fort
Benning, Ga.
   Her maternity leave had ended just two days earlier.
   At first, Kirk continued working at Royal Crown Cola in
Columbus, Ga., placing Cheyenne with a baby sitter.
   ``My boss told me you can't work and take care of the baby,
too,'' he recalls. ``I said `You watch me, I'll do it.' It lasted
five weeks.''
   Father and daughter then moved into his parents' southwestern
Michigan home, just minutes from his in-laws. Raising Cheyenne is a
family affair.
   Kirk's six brothers and sisters live at home or nearby. And
there are 10 grandchildren. ``We always have little babies around
the house, so it's nothing new,'' says his mother, Sonja.
   Fatherhood, however, was new for Kirk, now unemployed.
   ``He was sitting here one morning about 5:30, holding her and he
had changed her, dressed her and fed her and he looked at me and
said, `I don't care what you say, this is a woman's job,''' says
Kirk's father, Larry.
   But he has adjusted, rising before dawn, feeding Cheyenne her
formula, changing her diaper, dressing her, soothing her as she
starts teething.
   ``It's made me realize how much time and care a child needs,''
he says.
   He has learned Cheyenne loves baths and other children. And he
jokes about her temper.
   Kirk dutifully chronicles all these details to his wife in
letters, faxes, videos and a few precious phone calls.
   He tells her how big Cheyenne's brown eyes are, how she's grown
into a 16-pound charmer, how she's started crawling, how cute her
pierced ears are, how she enjoys looking in the mirror and how her
tiny feet already are outgrowing the red Mary Janes that match her
red velvet and lace dress.
   ``I think she worries about missing everything,'' Mrs. Vallance
says. ``She's not seeing any of this. I don't think she worries
about her care. She has the utmost confidence in him.''
   In one letter her mother received, Ms. Vallance told her a Saudi
family with a little girl visited her area one day. ``She said she
just had to go to her tent. She just broke down. She couldn't take
it.''
   Kirk and his mother-in-law stay busy. Both attended a support
group meeting for families with relatives in the Persian Gulf. ``It
just made me feel good to talk about it,'' he says.
   Both also try to be upbeat. Mrs. Vallance says her daughter is a
positive thinker who had no complaints about being ordered to the
Mideast. ``She really felt like it was her duty and that's what her
job was,'' she says.
   Last summer, Kirk thought his wife would be home in three
months. Then six. Now everyone is hopeful the family will be
reunited by Cheyenne's first birthday July 4th.
   Meanwhile, Kirk and Mrs. Vallance regularly show Cheyenne
pictures of her mother.
   A week before Christmas, Kirk's wife called and reassured him of
her safety. ``I told her it didn't matter, I'm still going to
worry,'' he says.
   ``I know someday we'll be back together,'' he adds. ``Hopefully,
soon.''

<HEAD>Japanese Geniuses Leave Their Brains to Posterity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Behind the tattooed skins, severed arms and rat
skeletons in the university lab rests the world's only collection
of famous brains, left to posterity by some of Japan's greatest
thinkers.
   Each of the 120 brains of prime ministers, novelists, artists
and scholars has its own container, something like a fish tank, in
the University of Tokyo's medical department.
   Scientists there hope to gain some insight into what makes the
brains of famous people special.
   ``We'd like to get many more,'' said Yutaka Yoshida, curator of
the collection. ``I'd especially like to get brains from
mathematicians, musicians and singers.''
   The collection was begun in 1913, when the family of Taro
Katsura, a three-time prime minister, asked that his brain be
preserved for study after his death. The newest acquisition is the
brain of former Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who died in 1988.
   So far, the deep-rooted reluctance among Japanese to tamper with
the dead has ensured that the museum's resources far outweigh its
ability to use them.
   ``We try, as far as possible, not to cut them,'' Yoshida said.
``We want to keep them in their original shape.''
   University researchers have cross-sectioned several brains to
allow some visual and microscopic comparisons. Most are
undisturbed, however, immersed in amber formaldehyde, gleaming
palely behind small handwritten cards giving the names and special
qualities of their original owners.
   Yoshida is a slight, quiet man with 13 years of experience in
the lab, which also has diseased selections of human anatomy and
wall-hangings of tattooed skins donated by men who wanted to have
their body art preserved.
   As curator, he has renewed efforts to learn from the collection
of famous brains.
   The brain of Hisashi Hamaguchi, an eloquent prime minister
assassinated in 1931, looks about the same as that of Natsume
Soseki, a famous novelist who died in 1916, or of Yasuko Miyake, a
writer who provided the only female brain in the collection.
   ``Researchers say the fibers in the part of Hamaguchi's brain
that controls speech are very complex, very special,'' he said,
referring to a part of the left hemisphere that regulates speech
and other motor functions in right-handed people.
   ``You can't do much research, just looking at the outside of the
brains,'' Yoshida said. ``We're obviously going to have to start
doing histological (microscopic tissue) studies in the future.
   Yoshida feels some Japanese would protest such studies.
   ``Somehow, I think the Japanese would want to keep the famous
brains the way they are now,'' he said. ``They wouldn't like to
have them laying around on lab benches.''
   Many universities keep frozen or preserved brains for research
purposes, but none has a collection of geniuses, Yoshida said.
   The Tokyo collection resulted from a preoccupation with the
differences between Asians and Caucasians, men and women, geniuses
and average people, that emerged during the Meiji Era (1868-1912),
when Japan began in earnest to study Western science and
technology.
   Eventually, Japanese medical researchers began to study brains,
with some controversial results. The brains of some famous people,
they found, were heavier than those of less distinguished thinkers.
   Japan's heaviest brain of record was that of Torasaburo Araki, a
politician and doctor who left 57.4 ounces of gray matter behind
when he died in 1942, and Prime Minister Katsura's brain was second
at 56 ounces). The average Japanese brain is said to weigh 45.5
ounces.
   ``It seems as if great thinkers ma indeed have heavier
brains,'' says Yoshida. ``But then, so do many criminals, I hear.
Maybe they have a different sort of intelligence.''

<HEAD>In Conformity-Minded Japan, How-To Guides are Big Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How-to guides are wildly popular in teaching
everything from dating to dressing in Japan, where pressures to
conform can be immense.
   ``How-to magazines attract Japanese readers, who are always
fearful of doing something different, by showing a standard of what
people should be doing,'' said Masayoshi Kinjo, editor of the
popular men's magazine Brutus.
   Recently, Brutus described the ``right'' way to behave on a
date:
   ``Order a tea immediately when your date shows up at a coffee
shop to meet you. ... Smile even at waitresses and passers-by to
better your image. ... Don't order drinks that make you look like a
wimp. ... And finally, enjoy sex.''
   Many young Japanese have trouble developing close relationships
because of scholastic rivalries with other students and their
parents' long working hours. Books and television teach them how to
do so, said Yasuo Ueda, an associate professor of journalism at
Sofia University in Tokyo.
   Store shelves are filled with how-to magazines, paperbacks,
comic books and videotapes.
   A typical company handbook provides guidance for conduct on the
job:
   ``Shave every morning and clip your nails occasionally. ... Keep
shoe polish and a brush in your locker to make your shoes always
shiny. ... Bend your head 15 to 30 degrees when you bow, but bow as
much as 45 degrees to apologize.''
   Researchers say reliance on such material results from an
education system designed to make everyone the same through rules
that dictate, for instance, the color of underwear and when
students may go to the bathroom.
   Critics of the propensity for conformity acknowledge the
education system's role in helping Japan become an economic
powerhouse, but fault schools for failing to teach students
creativity.
   ``Being always told what to do, people stop thinking ... and
young people have become very passive,'' said Ueda.
   ``There should be so many different ways for them to live their
own lives, but people are making decisions based on a few ...
stereotypes,'' he said in an interview.
   Bunchin Katsura, a well-known storyteller who teaches sociology
at Kansai University in Osaka, has had enough of the manuals.
   ``Could somebody please write a how-to book entitled `How Not to
Depend on How-To Books'?'' he said.
   Young people like the manuals because following them provides
reassurance that they are not outcasts from society.
   Katsura said the degree of reliance on self-help publications
became clear to him on Christmas of 1989, when he saw dozens of
young men lined up at a hotel checkout counter while their
girlfriends waited patiently to the side.
   He attributed the lobby gridlockto magazines that instruct
young men to seal a relationship with the opposite sex with a
proposal to spend an intimate Christmas Eve in a hotel room. In
Japan, Christmas is celebrated as an occasion to give gifts and to
be with friends, not as a religious holiday.
   About 1,800 how-to magazines are published in Japan each year,
in addition to many books, according to the Research Institute for
Publications.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger took the
easy job.
   As the star of the new movie ``Kindergarten Cop,''
Schwarzenegger only had to look like he was ruling a schoolroom of
children.
   As the movie's director and co-producer, Ivan Reitman actually
had to wrangle the 30 feisty tots - and coax a lot of comedy out of
them and their behemoth co-star.
   ``Just try to tell a kid to hit a mark,'' said Reitman, the
amiable director of ``Twins,'' ``Stripes,'' ``Ghostbusters'' and
its sequel.
   ``You say, `Walk across the room, stop on the line, say your
line and go over there and pick up a basketball.' Say that to a
5-year-old, and everything you've said before is forgotten. He
hears the word basketball, something to do with a basketball, you
call action and - boom! - he runs over and picks up the
basketball.''
   Having worked with such temperamental talents as Dan Aykroyd and
Debra Winger, Reitman, who's also the father of three children, was
equal to the task.
   Although they blew scores of lines and occasionally glanced into
the camera, Reitman believes the children in ``Kindergarten Cop''
turned out as solid as Schwarzenegger.
   In the movie written by Murray Salem and the team of Herschel
Weingrod and Timothy Harris, brutish police officer John Kimble
(Schwarzenegger) must teach an Oregon kindergarten class so he can
help track down a killer (Richard Tyson). A snarling, stubble-faced
tower of strength on the Los Angeles streets, Kimble is cowed by
the wiseacre infants. He must control them, or blow the case.
   A simple fire drill proves more difficult to Kimble than an
armed robbery; unbuckling a child's suspenders trickier than
defusing a time bomb.
   Having previously collaborated with Schwarzenegger on ``Twins,''
Reitman knew the star of ``Terminator,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Conan
the Barbarian'' and ``Predator'' possessed some comic skills. The
trick was to let the stereotype of the former body builder work for
``Kindergarten Cop,'' rather than against it.
   ``For the first reel or so, it's almost a parody of what he does
and what he has done,'' Reitman said. ``It's all very carefully
designed - down to the lighting and the camera angles - to bring up
sort of a `Terminator' image.
   ``I thought it would be very interesting - whether you can take
the icon and the Arnold cliche and then twist it around in new ways
and really believe in this guy right through the end: believe in
his situations and get involved with him emotionally and with the
people he meets.''
   Reitman, 44, and his family fled Czechoslovakia for Canada when
he was 4. He has produced ``National Lampoon's Animal House,''
``Heavy Metal'' and ``Casual Sex?''
   In ``Twins,'' he directed Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito as
genetically designed twin brothers. It marked Schwarzenegger's
emergence as an actor with more range than a variety of grunts and
accented obscenities.
   ``I thought `Kindergarten Cop' was a great film for him. ... He
had felt that he been getting typed - and he needed some more
complexities to the characters he was playing,'' Reitman said.
   ``Here's a guy who looks like a fantasy character at the top,
but if it works, he becomes a real multidimensional, complex human
being.''
   There were two primary challenges in making ``Kindergarten
Cop,'' Reitman said: balancing the story's alternating themes of
comedy, romance and drama and eliciting credible performances from
a bunch of 4-to-7-year-olds.
   ``There's a thing with child actors,'' said Reitman. ``When you
talk to them, they sound fine. But as soon as you give them
something that has to be repeated take after take or is printed on
a page, there's a very natural tendency to become stilted. And the
audition process (in which 2,000 children were interviewed) was
very difficult to sit through because of that.''
   The 30 children (including the twins Joseph and Christian
Cousins, who alternate as student Dominic) were instructed by
Reitman the first day to follow five simple rules: Know your
character, act natural, be disciplined, listen and don't look at
the camera.
   With three murders in ``Kindergarten Cop'' and a barrage of
beatings, Reitman admits kindergartners shouldn't see a film about
them.
   ``I really held back; you don't really see anything,'' Reitman
said. ``But it's just intense emotionally. I felt (the violence)
had to be there or the film would just peter out at the end.''

<HEAD>Tower Seeking to Settle Score for Nomination Defeat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Tower believes his former Senate
colleagues did him wrong when they rejected his nomination as
defense secretary. Now, he's settling the score.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., is a ``genuine boozer,'' Tower
writes in a book slated for publication in February. Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., is the ``Senate bully ... a study in arrogance
and pomposity.'' Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., ``has a tendency to
resort to flatulent indignation.''
   Tower, a four-term Texas senator and former Republican chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, suffered the most
ignominious defeat in March 1989 when the Senate turned down
President Bush's selection of him to head the Defense Department.
   The defeat came amid allegations that Tower was an excessive
drinker, womanizer and held close ties to defense contractors - all
charges he denies in the book.
   The rejection also capped a rancorous period in the new Bush
administration and the long tradition of Senate comity in which
only eight Cabinet nominees had been rejected in the nation's
history.
   The book, titled ``Consequences: A Personal and Political
Memoir'' and published by Little, Brown and Co., is Tower's first
extensive response to the damaging blow the Senate inflicted on his
Washington career.
   He leaves several bridges smoldering in the book's wake and
fires shots at Republicans and Democrats alike. Tower directs much
of the vitriol at Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee who led the fight against the nomination.
   ``Presidential ambitions were, I believe, a major factor in Sam
Nunn's decision to oppose my nomination,'' Tower writes.
   The former Texas senator goes on to say:
   ``If Nunn had suspected that he would end up looking like an
unscrupulous mudslinger who would stop at nothing to achieve his
objectives, perhaps he would have satisfied himself with making a
few critical comments expressing whatever reservations he may have
felt, even to the point of indicating that I was on probation, and
then voting to approve the nomination.
   ``But Sam Nunn was blinded by his own ambition.''
   Nunn's press secretary, Scott Williams, said last week that the
senator would have no comment on the book. In fact, calls to Senate
offices of the other lawmakers also drew a ``no comment'' reaction.
   Tower cites several reasons for Nunn's opposition and says the
armed services chairman was upset with Bush's selection from the
beginning.
   Tower believes that Nunn, who played a major role in advising
1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on defense
issues, was upset by Tower's attacks on Dukakis' policies. Tower
campaigned for Bush in several states.
   In addition, Tower had advised former President Reagan to veto
the fiscal 1989 defense authorization bill, legislation that
Congress, led by Nunn, and the Pentagon, headed by then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci, had worked out.
   Tower suggests in the book that Nunn was still smarting from
Reagan's decision.
   ``I did not regard Nunn as an obstacle. And that was a fatal
misreading of the situation,'' Tower writes in hindsight. ``What
lay before me, however, was not confirmation as secretary of
defense, but a political killing field prepared by the chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.''
   The attacks on Nunn are not limited to the confirmation process.
Tower also compares himself to Nunn.
   ``Unlike Sam Nunn, who has a reputation for being distant and
disdainful toward his staff, I treated my aides with friendship and
respect,'' Tower wrote. ``In return, I got tremendous loyalty and
extended effort. It was not at all unusual to punctuate a long,
stressful day with a break at the Monocle.''
   The Monocle is a popular restaurant and bar on Capitol Hill.
   Tower also criticizes the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who in Tower's
eyes failed to live up to his role as the panel's top GOP lawmaker
leading the fight for the president's nominee.
   ``To keep on good terms with Sam Nunn, he ceded the rights of
the Republican minority to object to a course of action that was
inimical to its best interests,'' Tower wrote.
   Warner, who argued in several Senate floor speeches for the
nominee and voted to confirm Tower, was the lone senator to respond
to the book.
   ``You've got to know John Tower as we do. It's his Texas
style,'' Warner said Thursday.
   Tower's attacks on Exon as a heavy drinker are not new. During
Exon's re-election fight against Republican Hal Daub in November,
Tower campaigned for the GOP candidate and made the same
accusations. Exon denied the charges.
   Tower does not limit his criticisms to the Senate. The former
senator believes that White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray's
inexperience in handling the nomination contributed in some ways to
its demise.
   In the end, Tower writes that he didn't resent his rejection as
much as he was upset with the way it was done.
   ``What was happening to me could have happened in an evil,
Kafkaesque society,'' Tower writes. ``It couldn't happen in the
United States. It couldn't happen in the U.S. Senate.''

<HEAD>Stock Market Leaders in '90: Blue Chips Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The more things have changed on Wall Street from
the '80s into the early '90s, the more one thing remains the same:
Big stocks keep soundly thrashing smaller counterparts in the
battle for investors' favor.
   As the bear-market year of 1990 draws to a close, the typical
loss suffered by big-name blue chips is far smaller than the
declines sustained by the great mass of smaller ``secondary''
stocks.
   For the latest 12-month period through early December, the
composite index of the New York Stock Exchange, where most large
stocks are traded, dropped 6.6 percent.
   Over the same span, both the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market and the American Stock Exchange market
value index showed losses exceeding 18 percent.
   This sort of thing has been happening regularly ever since the
mid-1980s, in apparent contravention of a prized doctrine among
stock analysts and academic researchers known as the ``small firm
effect.''
   Over most extended periods of time, their studies have
concluded, little stocks are likely to fare better than big stocks,
if only because small companies have room for greater percentage
growth.
   Several theories have been advanced to explain why this pattern
is no longer holding. For one thing, big stocks got greater benefit
from the takeover mania of the '80s than did those of small
companies, which had fewer assets to ``restructure.''
   For another, big stocks had a special attraction for foreign
investors, given their familiar names and their perceived
stability.
   But the most compelling reason of all may be the long-running
trend toward index investing - constructing portfolios for pension
funds, mutual funds and other large pools of money to look as much
as possible like a market index such as Standard &amp; Poor's composite
of 500 stocks.
   Indexers mostly buy big stocks and hold them, since big stocks
dominate the makeup of the indexes they try to replicate.
   Indexing enjoys great popularity as a low-cost way to
participate in long-term market gains, without the risk of
``underperforming'' that befalls many managed stock portfolios.
   It is not so popular in the stock brokerage business, however,
since it downplays just about every service Wall Street has to
sell, from stock-picking to execution of buy and sell orders.
   Indeed, John J. Phelan Jr., who retires Dec. 31 as chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange, cites it as a prime force in the
recession gripping the securities industry.
   ``It has put an enormous cost squeeze all through the system,''
he said during an interview last week, ``right from the
money-management end of it to the execution end of it.''
   Phelan's view of the near-term future offers little consolation
for either brokers or partisans of the small stocks. ``Indexing is
going to continue to have an enormous influence in the market for
the next three to five years,'' he says.
   But sooner or later, he maintains, the pendulum that has been
swinging away from active money management toward indexing will
reach a point where it turns back the other way.
   ``Just about the time everybody indexes and everybody says money
managers can't do better than the market, then we're going to get a
whole crop of them doing better than the market,'' he said. ``You
know that's going to come, but we haven't gone to that extreme yet.
   ``Money management is the only business in the world that says
`we're mediocre,''' Phelan concluded. ``The human condition is not
going to live with that for very long.''

   For stock-market investors and people who work
in the securities industry, it hasn't been easy to see much bright
promise in the early days of the 1990s.
   Stock prices have spent most of 1990 in a bear market that
surpassed the Crash of 1987 in duration, if not in severity.
   At the same time, Wall Street itself languished in the fourth
year of a stubborn industry slump.
   The end-of-an-era signals in 1990 seemed hard to miss. In
February the firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, kingpin of the '80s
junk-bond boom, abruptly collapsed and disappeared from the scene.
   Nine months later its foremost financier, Michael Milken, drew a
10-year prison sentence.
   But in the midst of these backward-looking events, many analysts
argue that the ground is being cleared and the seeds being sown for
more bounteous times in the investment world as the decade
progresses.
   ``The economy has tumbled into a serious recession,'' said Erich
Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. in New
York. ``The financial structure is at risk. Even so, the year ahead
could be surprisingly good for Wall Street.
   ``With an assist from the Federal Reserve, we expect the economy
to rebound during the second half of 1991. This has exciting
implications for financial markets.''
   To put a number on his optimism, David Bostian at Jesup,
Josephthal &amp; Co. forecasts that the Dow Jones industrial average
will climb to 5,000 as early as mid-decade.
   ``This recession is providing painful, but valuable, lessons to
governments, corporations and individuals that will improve their
economic conduct in the 1990s,'' he maintains.
   ``The new decade will see savings and investment favored
relative to consumption and equity favored over debt, to cite only
two critical changes.''
   Like many optimists in other areas of the economy, Wall Street's
bulls are counting on the present crunch ultimately to serve as a
purgative and restorative, rather than destructive, force.
   One central theme in this kind of argument is that the debt mess
of the 1980s, with all the problems it has caused, will be cleaned
up before too long, but not forgotten.
   Says Bostian, ``I think the banks may have learned a
long-to-be-remembered lesson on the importance of lending for
productive economic activity rather than financial speculation.''
   What is more, some observers argue, a reborn distaste for credit
excess is likely to help foster a long-lasting decline in interest
rates.
   ``Now that recession is clear to everyone, anxiety about
inflation will evaporate,'' contends Robert Barbera, economist at
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``Back-to-back decades of low inflation are likely to break the
back of inflationary expectations. As a consequence, interest rates
should decline more than inflation, as `real' rates fall as well.
   ``For investors who spent the past 10 years in money market
funds or certificates of deposit, the collapse of high real rates
on cash instruments is not good news.
   ``We believe that to obtain higher returns in the 1990s,
investors will need to accept the volatility associated with stocks
and bonds. And these of course would benefit from such a change in
strategy.''
   Whether they accept such reasoning or not, some analysts suspect
there is more pain to be endured before any party gets started.
   To establish a bona fide bottom to the bear market, they assert,
investors in greater numbers will have to be driven from the scene
in discouragement or disgust.
   This ``never again'' mood is not yet manifest in such important
arenas as mutual fund activity. Indeed, through the first 10 months
of 1990, while the stock market was sagging, investors snapped up
$56 billion in new shares of stock mutual funds, challenging a
record of $67 billion set in 1987.
   At past market bottoms, hardly anybody wanted any part of stock
funds.
   Observers looking for extremes of pessimism say the requisite
gloom is much easier to find, however, within the securities
industry itself, where talk abounds that the good days are forever
gone.
   Aside from the business of money management, executives in the
brokerage business these days seem hard-pressed to find any facet
of their operations that promises much money to be made.
   ``Wall Street has been through its own private recession for the
past three years,'' says Heinemann. ``Firms have cut back. They
have pared their costs.''

<HEAD>Recession May Produce a Better and Wiser Consumer</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-YE--Seeds of Rebirth</HEAD>

   Not so long ago Americans were carefree
consumers. Armed with credit cards, they went cheerfully into debt,
satisfying needs and whims with few worries about the future.
   But the broadening recession has made once-spendthrift shoppers
timid, as evidenced by a sharp downturn in spending. Yet some
observers see a silver lining to these hard times and say consumers
may emerge as wiser and more demanding customers.
   ``If consumers start retrenching and saving more, that might
make more money available for investment,'' which could stimulate
the economy, said Sandra Shaber, an economist with Futures Group in
Washington.
   The slowdown in consumer spending may just be a mixed blessing.
   ``It's bad in the sense that it's going to aggravate the
downturn in the economy in the short-term,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, a senior adviser with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., a
forecasting concern in Lexington, Mass. ``But in the long-term, a
lot of families have been loaded with debt, and they need time to
make an adjustment.''
   Still, consumer spending - which accounts for two-thirds of the
gross national product - must remain buoyant enough for the economy
to recover.
   Over the past few months, growth in consumer credit has dropped
sharply. In October, consumer credit was growing at an annual rate
of 2.4 percent, down from a 4.6 percent growth rate in September
and 5 percent in August.
   A year earlier, Americans were taking on debt much more freely.
Credit rose at an annual rate as high as 6 percet in August 1989.
   ``The great heyday when consumers were borrowing even more
rapidly than what their income growth was came in '86,'' Ms. Shaber
said. But for the next two years debt continued to grow but at
about the same pace as income, and since the beginning of 1990, it
has fallen behind the rate of income growth, she said.
   Ms. Shaber attributed the recent slippage in consumer debt to a
slowdown in income growth that began in 1989 and continued into
this past year. ``People have less money to spend and they're going
to buy less,'' she said.
   Other factors also have helped bring consumer spending levels in
line with income. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which phased out the
deduction for most consumer debt, made some Americans realize they
had to take a more responsible attitude toward spending.
   Many consumers have put spending on non-essentials such as
clothing, furniture and appliances, on hold as the unemployment
rate climbs and the Middle East crisis looms as a huge uncertainty.
   The reluctance to spend money in department and discount stores
has forced retailers to become more lean by cutting their
inventories and buying less merchandise. With less demand for goods
at U.S. factories, production is down, and that has meant layoffs
for hundreds of thousands of workers in recent months.
   It doesn't end there. Consumers who are not working have even
less money, so they are scaling back spending and the cycle begins
all over again.
   Harry L. Davis, a professor of marketing at the University of
Chicago Graduate School of Business, found another silver lining:
People, having little money to waste on goods that wear out or
break down easily, are becoming better consumers.
   They ``have learned how to say, `No, this quality isn't high
enough,''' Davis said.
   A consumer's decision to put off a big purchase ``may be the
result of being to some extent better informed and wanting to buy
things that are going to be longer-lasting values,'' he said.
   This growing sophistication among consumers is putting pressure
on U.S. manufacturers to come up with better ideas and products.
   Automakers must now market their cars based on durability and
safety instead of image, while ``McDonald's is spending a lot of
time grappling with consumer demands for healthier food,'' Davis
said.
   Manufacturers are not the only ones having to shape up.
   Retailers, facing tougher competition for fewer consumer
dollars, must come up with better merchandise at the right price.
They have to improve customer service and make their stores
convenient and attractive.
   ``The consumers are providing more challenge to companies,''
Davis said.

<HEAD>Bush's Higher Taxes, Saddam's Higher Oil Hits Families Hard</HEAD>

   If you read the lips of George Bush and Saddam
Hussein in 1990, you're probably wondering how you're going to pay
the oil and tax bills this coming year.
   Those two elements of the economic equation suddenly turned into
wild cards, but the news isn't all bad.
   Higher taxes, for one, could help trim the U.S. budget deficit,
which many economists call the main problem. Others fear a bigger
tax bite will hamper economic expansion.
   Higher oil prices might revive energy conservation, but it seems
doubtful they will last. The Persian Gulf crisis also has prompted
the government to speed efforts at developing a national energy
policy.
   But in the short run, the higher tax and fuel bills won't be
much fun for anybody except perhaps the tax collectors and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``Consumers have to cut back on their spending because they're
spending more money on fuel and heating oil,'' said Edwin S.
Rothschild, of Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer group.
``Businesses are having to spend more and people are being laid
off. The airlines are having a hard time.''
   Rothschild estimated that before this cold season ends, the
average household that uses home heating oil will have to pay
between $300 and $500 more to keep warm.
   Consumers also were paying about 30 cents a gallon more for
gasoline as the year drew to a close. Experts pointed out, however,
that when inflation is taken into account, fuel prices were much
cheaper in 1990 than they were in the early 1980s, when the
aftershocks of the Iranian revolution pushed oil prices higher.
   Regardless, the effects of the expensive oil will ripple through
the economy, which is already running into hard times.
   ``It is a major contributing factor to the recession that we are
entering,'' Rothschild said.
   Although many economists and Wall Streeters were proclaiming a
recession throughout the fall, the government carefully avoided
uttering what has become known as the dreaded ``R-word.''
   The administration's deeds spoke louder than words, however,
when Bush abandoned his ``read my lips'' pledge of no new taxes.
The government instituted a sweeping package of higher taxes on
income, gasoline, cigarettes and liquor.
   The gasoline tax increase of 5.1 cents a gallon added to the
burden of higher fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis.
Economists say it will hit working people and the poor hardest.
   During 1990, Americans had to work full-time from Jan. 1 to May
5 before they had paid off their entire tax burden, according to
the Tax Foundation, a Washington watchdog group.
   It's too early to pinpoint the date of ``Tax Freedom Day'' for
1991, but the foundation estimates it will be pushed back again.
   ``It really can't help but make it even worse,'' Tax Foundation
spokesman Bill Ahern said. ``The only thing that could prevent the
day from getting worse would be a phenomenal economic recovery for
1991 that doesn't seem to be in the cards. If you look at the taxes
... they are substantial.''
   Many economists see the tax burden as a bigger threat to the
family budget than expensive oil, because oil is plentiful despite
the Gulf crisis.
   In December, OPEC ministers agreed to reinstate production
quotas once the turmoil ends, but oil analysts predict the cartel
will have a tough time executing that plan.
   The American Petroleum Institute, a leading industry trade
organization, said if crude prices come down and stay down, the
prices of refined petroleum products will have to follow.
   As 1991 progresses, it could reveal whether the United States
has changed any of its energy priorities after suffering the oil
shock of 1990.
   The Energy Department is expected to release a long-awaited
energy strategy that will include expanded uses of alternative
fuels as well as proposals for drilling for oil in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.

   It was the year Manhattan apartment prices
actually went down and some California builders, staggering under
unsold inventories, gave away a new car with each house sold.
   In Florida, new homes and condos sat empty because retirees
could not sell their homes up North. Would-be home sellers in
affluent New York suburbs slashed asking prices by $100,000 and
more, and still no takers.
   It was the year when Lucille Ball's mansion in Beverly Hills -
an enclave where common economic trends aren't supposed to apply -
sat unpurchased even after the asking price was cut from $7.8
million to $5.6 million.
   It was the year in which even the red-hot Seattle market turned
as cool as the squalls off Puget Sound.
   In short, it was a time when regional weaknesses in home sales -
the Northeast since the stock market crash of 1987, the oil states
before that - threatened to engulf the country in a national real
estate recession.
   Or at least both coasts. In many parts of the South and Midwest,
home prices and sales levels have remained at more modest levels.
   Sales were up 3 percent during the first 11 months of 1990 at
RE-MAX of Northern Illinois, said Betty Hegner, the president of
the operation with 116 offices and nearly 2,000 agents.
   ``I have to say, there are some markets where there definitely
is a softening of the market, especially during the last quarter,''
she said.
   Expensive homes, those priced above $200,000, were selling
slowly recently, in part because their owners won't reduce prices,
she said. ``But we have a lot of bright spots, too. We think it's a
good time to buy.''
   Even on the coasts, was it a recession or merely the end of a
cycle? That was still unclear in many regions. Take the Northwest,
where few could believe that 1989 and early 1990 sales and prices
could long be sustained, any more than the increases in California
in 1988 could go on forever.
   ``We had phenomenal appreciation,'' said Maria Bunting,
executive vice president of Windermere Real Estate in Seattle.
``For a real estate agent, it was as good as the wildest dreams of
what they would like it to be.''
   By spring, houses flooded the market as prices peaked. Buyers
pulled back. Sellers panicked. And home prices began to fall over
the summer.
   ``It was an adjustment period,'' Ms. Bunting said, describing
the region as now having a normal buyer-seller balance.
   Lower prices brought home ownership closer to millions of
people. National Association of Realtors statistics showed a
decline from July to October of $98,300 to $92,800 in the median
price of a home, the price at which half of the sales were for
more, half for less.
   Jill and Robert McCarty saw both sides of the equation and
figure they came out ahead. The couple - he an accountant and she a
manicurist - bought their dream house in December - a four-bedroom,
2,100-square-foot new home with a three-car garage in Saugus, an
outer suburb north of Los Angeles.
   They sold their first home, a ``fixer-upper'' they bought six
years ago for $105,000 in the working class Sun Valley area of Los
Angeles, for $207,000.
   ``We listed it at $229,000, which would have been the fair price
a little while ago, but after two weeks we dropped the price when
we saw what was happening,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, they returned to the tracts in more comfortably

in extras with abandon.
   ``We had been looking for two years up there, and couldn't find
anything we could afford,'' she said. ``So when the market got
slow, we said let's see what we could do. We got a $310,000 home
for $250,000.''
   That price included $5,000 in closing costs paid by the builder
and another $5,000 in luxury carpet.
   ``We're never moving again,'' McCarty said. ``We would never
have been able to do it if the market hadn't been like this.''

   Hard times could put a squeeze on research and
development spending by U.S. businesses, but experts warn against
cutbacks that divert Americans from the global technology race.
   ``It's an easy but foolish place to cut,'' said Richard Shaffer,
editor of Technologic Computer Letter, a computer industry
newsletter.
   Despite gloomy talk, many experts say U.S. scientists and
engineers continue to make breakthroughs in a variety of fields and
hold their own in a number of technologies.
   ``I don't think we're any less innovative and creative than we
were 20 years ago, even though some people think we're becoming
soft and the Japanese are going to run over us,'' said Donald
Wilson, an assistant professor of management at Rochester Institute
of Technology.
   Still, some financially struggling companies have little choice.
   ``It's self-defeating in the long run, but if you're worried
about surviving this year you don't worry about the long run,''
said David Wyss, research director of the economic consulting firm
DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.
   The need for U.S. companies to maintain research and development
spending is especially acute in light of stepped-up research
efforts by Japanese companies, particularly in this country.
   In recent years, many Japanese high-technology companies have
opened U.S. research centers, to which they attract U.S. scientists
with high salaries. Japanese companies also have boosted research
spending at U.S. universities.
   Wilson said these moves are an admission that the United States
is a hub of innovation. ``We're seen as kind of the creative
leaders,'' he said.
   U.S. companies overall spend more than twice as much on research
and development as their Japanese counterparts, but a smaller
amount as a percentage of gross national product.
   Japan's Science and Technology Agency says that nation's
research and development spending equaled about 2.85 percent of its
GNP in 1989, compared with 2.53 percent in the United States.
   In 1990, U.S. corporate R&amp;D spending is expected to total about
$108 billion, with $35.7 billion of that coming from the federal
government, the National Science Foundation says.
   As for the year ahead, a trade group called the Industrial
Research Institute is optimistic. Its survey of 137 major
research-oriented companies shows 41 percent plan to spend at least
6 percent more on R&amp;D than in 1990. Only 16 percent expect a
decline.
   But, the group notes, ``The respondents' combined R&amp;D as a
percent of sales is not expected to change from 1990 to 1991. A
sluggish economy, therefore, would restrain actual R&amp;D spending
increases.''
   The National Science Foundation says it began detecting a drop
in annual growth of R&amp;D spending by U.S. companies as early as
1986. Such spending grew 4 percent to 10 percent a year in the
early 1980s after adjusting for inflation, but fell to 2 percent to
3 percent a year since 1986, the group says.
   ``One of the main reasons was simply a slowdown in sales and
profit expectations,'' said foundation spokesman John Jankowski.
   An additional drag on corporate R&amp;D spending has been the
decline in the federal defense budget, he said.
   Some experts believe the recession will force U.S. companies to
change the emphasis of their research.
   ``I think they will try and do more with less, which really
means we will see a substantial focusing down. Peripheral areas or
(research with) longer-term horizons will disappear,'' said G.
Steven Burrill, director of high technology for Ernst &amp; Young, the
accounting and consulting firm.
   David Methe, another Rochester Institute of Technology
management professor, says the real danger in a recession is that
U.S. companies may lay off research workers. These employees
represent ``repositories of knowledge and receptors of knowledge
from outside'' that could not easily be replaced, he said.
   Experts say they don't expect the recession to have the same
impact on R&amp;D in Japan, where companies are said to have a much
longer-term focus.
   ``I see them going the other direction,'' with increased
research spending, Burrill said.
   While the total amount of U.S. corporate research spending is
important, experts say they are equally concerned - if not more so
- about the ability of U.S. companies to turn innovations into
products.
   U.S. companies have long excelled at basic research, but have a
spotty history of capitalizing on these breakthroughs in the
marketplace. That is an area in which the Japanese appear to have a
clear lead.
   ``When you look at almost any product, the basic work of it was
done in the U.S. and Europe, and when the products came out they
were Japanese, whether it's CDs or video tapes,'' said Wyss.
   Experts trace part of the reason to the greater number of
engineers in Japan as a percentage of the population than in the
United States. Another factor they cite is that Japanese research
is often more pragmatic and product-oriented.

   Viewed as a mechanical structure, the U.S.
economy needs retooling, reconditioning, rebuilding. Parts have to
be rehoned, bolts and rivets tightened, and the whole works needs a
lube job.
   It hasn't collapsed like the Soviet system, and it isn't likely
to do so. It doesn't need junking either, because nothing better
has been invented to replace it. But it is badly worn, abused by
the greed and grind of the 1980s.
   The greatest erosion was from debt, and the Resolution Trust
Corp. has the job of liquidating or selling off hundreds of
collapsed savings and loan associations, with the total bill
conceivably reaching $600 billion.
   Throughout 1990, banks were forced to write off billions of
dollars in failed corporate deals, and loans with real estate
developers and Third World nations. The total bank bill could only
be surmised, but the extent of the damage was illustrated when just
one, Chase Manhattan Corp., took a $1 billion charge against
earnings to cover bad debts.
   One of the oddest twists in the credit disaster was that banks
themselves found it difficult to raise money; bankers, accustomed
to hearing tales of woe from would-be borrowers, had worse problems
of their own. Chase, the nation's second largest commercial banking
enterprise, was forced to offer 13.017 percent to sell $200 million
of notes. Citicorp, parent of the largest bank, suffered the
indignity of having its own credit rating lowered.
   Industrial companies, many loaded with debt, showed the strains.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. found that dividend increases in 1990 fell
to their lowest levels in 20 years, 23 percent fewer than in 1989.
The payout money just wasn't there.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that in the first 11 months of 1990,
55,000 companies failed, up 19 percent from 1989. Also disturbing
was that the size of liabilities was up sharply, indicating that
more large companies were filing for protection from creditors.
   Nearly every industry was affected by failures. Failures among
real estate companies, which floated the debt; among financial
institutions, which helped them raise the funds; and among
insurers, which bought the high-yielding debt, rose more than 30
percent.
   What was the extent of that corporate debts? This:
   -Nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross
national product rose to 67 percent in 1989 from 47 percent 20
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago.
   -In the late 1980s, half the funds raised by nonfinancial
corporations came from debt issues, with the other half from equity
offerings. But as recently as the 1960s and 1970s, the average was
only 24 percent debt.
   -In the 20 years through 1989, the ratio of interest expense to
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent.
   Since the market plunge of 1987, securities firms had been
shrinking their own businesses - disbanding departments that had
helped arrange takeovers and junk-bond offerings, laying off
workers and closing entire offices. The pace quickened in 1990.
With the economy sinking, deal-making was done, and rather than
Christmas bonuses, many high-paid employees received pink slips.
   Consumers were in debt, up to the limit of their Visa cards or
the caps on their home equity loans. Personal bankruptcies rose 15
percent in 1990, and would likely rise again in 1991. Late in the
year home mortgage delinquencies also rose.
   Uncle Sam, of course, remained in debt, unable to balance his
budget. By some estimates, the budget deficit could exceed $300
billion in the coming year. This, after a tortuous round of
so-called budget trimming.
   Economic growth inevitably succumbed to such impossible
circumstances, and the big question now is how deep the downturn
will be. The consensus of forecasts, including that from the White
House, is that any recession will be shallow and brief, probably
ending during the summer.
   However, many of the forecasts come with a caveat - that never
in the post-World War II era have similar conditions been
encountered. Forecasters point to the rickety condition of the
financial underpinnings and ask if those loans can be repaid in an
orderly way; or whether the structural rivets will give way.
   Clearly, a new era is here. In the old era, credit was cool; in
the new, debt is dumb. Businesses seeking to rid themselves of debt
are offering lenders equity instead. RJR Nabisco Inc., taken
private in the biggest debt-financed buyout ever, offered just
before Christmas to trade stock and cash for some of it
high-yielding junk bonds.
   Lenders are biting the bullet and writing off loans that once
they claimed were still collectable. Consumers are cutting
consumption.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady hinted that legislation
affecting banking would be on the agenda for 1991. The
administration of President Bush, he said, was committed ``to
promoting legislation and encouraging regulations that will allow
banks to reshape their activities to operate profitably and soundly
in business environment made new by technological changes.''
   Meanwhile, businesses and households are seeking to cut waste,
work more productively, and get those bills paid. In short, America
is banking on a return to the old verities - chief among them the
exercise of common sense.

   The Big Three automakers have fresh management
teams and their employees have new contracts, but don't be fooled:
The U.S. auto industry is facing old problems requiring action.
   Car and truck sales tumbled in 1990, profits fell and the
specter of losses reappeared. Blue-collar workers wondered weekly
if they would be at home or on the assembly line. The industry was
declared to be in a recession.
   In a climate of unprecedented competition that includes Japanese
companies building cars in the United States, executives and labor
union leaders are looking for new ways to make money.
   ``We are facing ... an extremely competitive struggle which is
not going to go away,'' Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz said.
``The economy can turn around, but the Japanese transplants and the
offshore producers will still be there.''
   ``We've got to tell the Fords, the Chryslers, the Hondas, the
Nissans that we've got a product for them,'' said Joseph
Hasenjager, union president at a General Motors Corp. brake
component plant in Dayton, Ohio. ``That's the only way you get job
security.''
   Union and management leaders are hopeful that new three-year
contracts between GM, Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. and the
United Auto Workers will create harmony and avoid disputes that
could further hurt the industry.
   The contracts cover more than 450,000 active autoworkers. The
companies have committed billions of dollars to provisions for full
wages for workers laid off from plants closed because of sales
slumps.
   ``It is essential that we retain the good will we have,'' Ford
President Philip Benton said. ``The contract has reinforced that
atmosphere.''
   The industry will need all the good feelings it can muster - and
more - to reverse losses in market share.
   At the end of November, the Big Three held just over 70 percent
of the U.S. car and truck market to about 24 percent for Japanese
automakers. In 1989, GM, Ford and Chrysler had a 73.7 percent share
to 22.4 percent for the Japanese.
   The industry appeared to be ready for a recovery in the late
summer when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Oil prices skyrocketed, and car
and truck sales fell. In the last three months of 1990, the Big
Three companies are expected to record their first quarterly loss
since 1981.
   ``Profits are under enormous pressure in North America, and they
started out from an abysmal level,'' Benton said.
   Analysts expect Big Three profits to fall about 75 percent in
1990 from $8.4 billion the previous year. That means intensified
competition for the fewer car and truck buyers.
   GM's is making the challenge from Spring Hill, Tenn., site of
its Saturn car project. The seven-year, $3 billion effort is aimed
directly at the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla.
   But car buying tanked as the first car rolled off the assembly
line. Executives predicted that up to one-third of first-year sales
would come from owners of other GM vehicles.
   Saturn's quality control resulted in far fewer cars being
shipped to dealers than expected. Some dealers, who had invested
millions in Saturn, were asked to delay openings or had only one or
two cars on the showroom floor.
   It didn't make for good public relations in an industry that has
stressed vehicle quality, recognizing the reputation of Japanese
automakers for reliability.
   Management shakeups also are part of the Big Three's hopes for
revival.
   Within 10 hours of officially succeeding Roger Smith in GM's top
job, Robert Stempel unveiled a new management structure. At Ford,
Harold Poling took over from Donald Petersen, but only for three
years.
   At Chrysler, vice chairman Gerald Greenwald took early
retirement to head a union effort to buy United Airlines. The bid
failed, but Greenwald still received a reported $9 million.
   As the industry worried about the erosion in Americans' devotion
to American cars, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca faulted Greenwald
for leaving the struggling automaker.
   ``He grew up with me. He'd been in the car business for 32
years, same two companies as me - Ford and Chrysler,'' said
Iacocca, who delayed his 1991 retirement plans. ``Isn't there
anything sacred anymore? Isn't there any loyalty to anything?''

   Ten years after a flood of low-cost imports
devastated America's steelmakers, one of the nation's historic core
industries is competitive again.
   ``It took a great deal of pain and suffering, but the industry
is now awake and in some cases remarkably astute and smart,'' said
John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia.
   The pain came in the form of 200,000 job reductions, hundreds of
mill closings and billions of dollars in spending to increase
efficiency. The gain is evident in falling imports and rising
profits.
   Lower production costs and a weaker dollar have boosted American
steel's competitiveness. U.S. steelmakers now produce a ton of
steel in about 5{ man-hours, lowest in the world and nearly half
the time it took in 1980.
   Still, the United States remains the world's biggest steel
importer. Foreign rivals - especially Japan and the European
Community - aren't standing still.
   ``The Japanese already were further ahead and they're running at
a much faster pace,'' said Hans Mueller, an economics professor and
consultant at Middle Tennessee State University. ``The Americans
are just catching up.''
   In the first nine months of 1990, imports comprised about 17
percent of the U.S. steel market, making America the world's
largest importer, according to the American Iron and Steel
Institute, a Washington trade group. Most imports came from Europe
and Japan, followed by Canada, South Korea, Brazil and many other
countries.
   The EC and Japan are the world's leading exporters of finished
steel. The United States exported about 4.6 million tons in 1989,
far less than the top exporters.
   The relative value of international currencies, more than
anything else, will determine the global competitiveness of
American steel in the 1990s, said Charles A. Bradford, a metals
expert for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
   ``The steel industry may be the biggest beneficiary of the
weakness in the dollar,'' he said. ``The biggest cost of an
integrated steelmaker is wages. If you compare wages around the
world, it's all a matter of the value of the dollar.''
   The United States was the dominant force in the international
steel market following World War II and led the world in steel
production in the 1950s.
   But Japan and European countries rebuilt their postwar
industries from scratch using modern technology. As U.S. mills
rusted, imports cracked 15 percent by the 1970s and reached an
all-time high of 26.4 percent in 1984.
   American steelmakers lost about $11.9 billion from 1980 to 1986,
when hundreds of mills closed and more than 200,000 workers
nationwide left the payrolls.
   The picture is brighter now. Steelmakers made about $1.5 billion
in profits in 1989. The cost of halting production while plants
were modernized was a major factor in 1989 and will continue to
hurt profits.
   ``The cost of modernization is taking its toll, but in the long
run they're much better off,'' Bradford said. ``This is what you
need to do if you want to be competitive.''
   In 1980, about 20 percent of American steel was made in modern
continuous casters, which turn molten steel directly into slabs,
skipping costly and time-consuming steps.
   Today about 66 percent of American steel is made that way and
the figure is expected to reach about 90 percent by the year 2000,
said Sheldon Wesson, a spokesman for the American Iron and Steel
Institute. In 1989, Japan made about 94 percent of its steel and
Belgium about 91 percent in continuous casters.
   ``The effort goes on. Nobody is satisfied,'' Wesson said. ``The
industry says it has spent in the last 10 years perhaps half what
it would have liked to spend on mill modernization.''
   ``You look at the profit picture and you wonder where the next
billion is going to come from,'' he said. ``This is all
self-financed. This is all pulling yourself up by the boot
straps.''

   A city that relies on the auto industry
to avoid the recession gripping the rest of America? It's happening
in Nashville.
   Economists said this Southern city took its economic lumps early
and has settled into a period of stability as other regions are
forced to retrench. The consolidation and weeding out already has
occurred.
   ``I think what has happened in Nashville is that the boom growth
levels have slowed down,'' said William Fox, an economist at the
University of Tennessee's Center for Business and Economic
Research.
   ``And in that sense, Nashville might have taken its economic
lick early,'' he said.
   Leading the way in Nashville are a budding automotive
manufacturing industry, a diversified services sector and an early
brush with negative growth economists said.
   ``Construction, for example, took a beating (in 1989) and a
little into (1990),'' Fox said. ``But at a time when maufacturing
is generally going down, Nashville is being held up by the auto
industry, which is kind of odd.''
   Car and truck sales and industry profits dropped in 1990, but
two big manufacturers have chosen sites near Nashville for new
factories on which they are pinning hopes for buoyant sales.
   General Motors Corp. built its $1.9 billion Saturn Corp. plant
in Spring Hill, about 40 miles south of Nashville. The plant and
its more than 3,600 employees and 700 contract workers began making
the car in October.
   More than 3,500 people are employed by Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. in Smyrna, about 25 miles southeast of
Nashville.
   Nissan is in the midst of an $490 million expansion that will
add 2,000 production jobs for total employment of 5,500 by 1992.
The expansion will raise Nissan's Smyrna investment to $1.2
billion.
   GM embarked on the seven-year Saturn effort to develop a car
that could compete with the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Toyota
Corolla.
   Saturn is in the early production stages and has not yet reached
full output, unlike aging plants that automakers are closing
elsewhere in the country.
   ``Nissan and Saturn don't look like they'll be a factor in
recession,'' Fox said.
   ``(Saturn) intended to start slowly. Nissan is still in its
expansion mode, so they are not influenced by the business cycle,''
he said. ``They very well may be influenced three years from now.''
   Nissan plans to build 165,000 Sentras at Smyrna in the 1991
model year. The plant has a production capacity of 180,000 cars a
year, Nissan's manufacturing president Jerry Benefield said.
   The Japanese automaker, which also produces light pickup trucks
in Smyrna, will add a third vehicle line - which has not been
disclosed - with the expansion.
   Nashville also is weathering the decline facing other big cities
because of a broad and ``recession-proof'' services sector of
insurance companies, hospitals and the headquarters of Hospital
Corp. of America.
   ``It has a nice diversified economy, and it's very well
located,'' Fox said. ``This place is very well situated for growth
and there's no reason to worry about it.''

   Credit Boeing for the soft landing.
   Recessions usually hit this area harder than elsewhere. But this
time, economists say, the good fortune of The Boeing Co. should
cushion Seattle and much of Washington state from the economic
downturn of the rest of the country.
   In a state where a superheated economy produced an average
annual job growth of 5 percent since 1985, economists are
forecasting that things might return to normal.
   Economically, the late 1980s were kind to Seattle. Real estate
values soared in a city considered by many to be among the most
livable. Jobs were so plentiful that fast-food joints offered $7.25
an hour for flipping burgers. Developers rebuilt the city's skyline
with more than a dozen major buildings.
   Much of that prosperity can be attributed to Boeing, which has
104,700 workers in Washington and accounts for one out of every six
jobs, directly or indirectly, in the state.
   By late December Boeing had received $46.6 billion in new
commercial jet business for 1990, approaching a sixth record year
of orders. Planes ordered three or four years ago are rolling off
assembly lines at a rate of better than one a day.
   In November, however, state officials acknowledged that the
recession gripping much of the country had spread mildly to
Washington. State economist Chang Mook Sohn forecasts a net loss of
10,000 non-farm jobs statewide in the first half of 1991, about .5
percent of the 2.1 million member workforce.
   In Seattle, a real estate market that had seen home prices climb
60 percent to 70 percent from 1987 to 1989 returned to normal, as
too many homes were put up for sale for prices too few buyers could
afford.
   Construction also declined, with some commercial developers
delaying projects and complaining about an overbuilt downtown. Weak
manufacturing and construction in turn have hurt services, the
retail-wholesale trade and finance sectors, Sohn said.
   What happened? Again, Sohn and other economists look to Boeing.
   From 1983 to 1989, Boeing's employment in this area exploded
from 58,000 to 106,000 - 37 percent of all jobs created in
Washington during that period were with the planemaker.
   ``It was the main force behind the rapid immigration to the
state and the main force behind the housing boom that resulted,''
said Douglas Pedersen, vice president and chief economist for
Security Pacific Bank of Washington.
   Boeing's employment peaked in 1989 as commercial production
became more efficient and defense cuts threatened government
projects. While the growth in aerospace jobs appears over for now,
Sohn says Boeing's employment isn't likely to fall much further.
   One of the big differences between the current downturn and
previous recessions, Sohn said, is the role of the aerospace
industry. In the past, a slowdown in planemaking was an advance
symptom of a recession and tended to pull down Washington's
economy.
   ``Aerospace works this time is a buffer rather than a
destabilizing force,'' he said.
   The recession of the early '80s was magnified here by Boeing
laying off 22,000 employees as orders and deliveries of aircraft
fell.
   In 1982, 106 aircraft were ordered and 176 were delivered. As
1990 drew to a close, Boeing's orders already had reached 517
airplanes, and it had delivered at least 364.
   It has a firm backlog of at least 1,850 planes and hundreds more
options for purchases, and is booking delivery dates past the turn
of the century.
   The region isn't without its worries, though. The timber
industry, for example, is hurting from a slump in homebuilding and
higher log prices.
   The home construction slowdown also has hit here, but again, not
as hard as elsewhere.
   Statewide housing starts for 1990 total 43,600, about 3.8
percent fewer than 1989, Pedersen says. Commercial construction
also is lagging.
   ``There's very little new building under way and little
likelihood of more building in the next few years,'' said Jon
Runstad, president and chief executive officer of Wright Runstad, a
major Seattle developer.

<HEAD>For the Banks It Was Better to Receive Than to Give</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All the economy wanted for Christmas was a
discount rate cut - or so everyone thought.
   The Federal Reserve's gift, opened this past week, received a
lukewarm reception from the nation's bankers and provided no
immediate relief from the threat of recession.
   The Fed's rate cut was generous by historical standards - a half
point to 6.5 percent. It was the first reduction in the lending
rate to banks in more than four years.
   It even arrived early, well before the the first of the year
when most prognosticators had expected it.
   Still, the Fed's generosity was lost on most banks, which
declined to pass the easier credit terms on to their customers.
Only one big bank, First National Bank of Chicago, cut its prime
lending rate in the wake of the Fed's big move.
   Others, like Citicorp, appeared too weak to respond. The
nation's biggest banking company said it would suffer a
fourth-quarter loss of up to $400 million from the costs of setting
cash aside to cover bad debts and shrinking its staff by 8.5
percent or about 8,000 employees. Citicorp also said it would slash
its dividend by 44 percent.
   Without the major banks to keep the credit lines pumping down to
businesses and consumers, the economic rescue mission launched by
the Fed could be complicated.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Only the Inflation News Was Good</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Statistics released during the week highlighted the economy's
ills:
   -The merchandise trade deficit, swelled by auto imports and the
high cost of foreign oil, climbed to $11.61 billion in October, the
biggest imbalance in almost three years.
   -Starts of single-family houses in November fell to their lowest
level since the 1981-82 recession.
   -Consumer spending in November rose just 0.1 percent, and income
growth only matched inflation.
   Most distressing for the future of the economy was a report
showing businesses planned only a slight increase in spending for
modernization and expansion in 1991.
   Inflation, which rose only modestly in November, provided the
only good news and cleared the way for the Fed's move.
   The Fed read the 0.3 percent rise in consumer prices last month
as a signal it could safely loosen credit without giving ground in
its fight to keep inflation controlled.

   Hard times continued to dog Wall Street. Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. said it would report a 1990 loss of about $250
million, more than double what analysts who follow the company had
expected.
   Its parent, the Prudential Insurance Co. of America, rushed to
bolster the finances of the investment firm with a $200 million
injection of new capital.
   John Phelan, who departs the New York Stock Exchange's top post
Dec. 31, said in an interview that he expected the recession in the
securities business to last another six to 18 months.
   But the outgoing chairman said the slump would give way to a
``roaring'' recovery by the mid-90s.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: TWA-Pan Am Deal Moves Closer, RJR Trades In Junk</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am and TWA, two of the oldest and weakest airlines, appeared
close to a combination that would end their rivalry and mark one of
the most dramatic consolidations in the troubled industry. Pan Am
Corp. said it had tentatively agreed to an acquisition valued at
about $375 million by Trans World Airlines. But Pan Am said it
would need an emergency loan to keep flying while the deal was
under negotiation.
   TWA owner Carl Icahn made the purchase offer last Sunday after
selling off some prized London routes to American Airlines in a
deal that could be worth $625 million to TWA.
   RJR Nabisco, taken private in the biggest leveraged buyout in
history, continued efforts to lighten its debt load. The company
said it would trade cash and stock for more than $750 million in
junk bonds issued to finance last year's $25 billion buyout. With
the stock-for-junk swap, the food and tobacco giant would be left
with about $19 billion in debt to manage from the buyout.
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co., weighed down by debts from a 1986 buyout,
completed a minor miracle on 34th Street by selling $119 million in
stock to investors. The New York retailer planned to use the cash
to retire some of the debts rolled up in the $3.7 billion buyout.
   Chrysler Corp. bolstered takeover defenses in response to Kirk
Kerkorian's purchase of a minor stake in the automaker. Chrysler
executives said they were suspicious of Kerkorian's motives.
   Zenith Electronics Corp. and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
said they were jointly developing a high-definition television
system based on a computerized digital signal. The effort is one of

   Don Dixon, one of the nation's most notorious savings and loan
figures, was convicted of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars
from depositors of his Texas thrift.
   A jury found him guilty of spending money from Vernon Savings
Association on a California beach house and prostitutes. The
52-year-old Dixon Dixon faces a maximum sentence of 115 years in
jail and a $5.75 million fine.
   President Bush's son Neil, under scrutiny for his dealings with
a Colorado savings and loan, was found guilty of a conflict of
interest by an administrative law judge.
   But the young Bush averted the ultimate punishment of a
permanent ban from the banking business. According to the ruling,
he could still accept a future position with a savings institution
under certain restrictions.
   The government's Office of Thrift Supervision charged Bush with
a conflict in his role as a director of the failed Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver.
   Lawyers for Michael Milken notified a federal court they plan to
appeal his 10-year prison sentence for securities fraud. The

<HEAD>The Fed's Christmas Card to Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The campaign to try to brighten up Wall Street
in time for the holidays has received some extra last-minute help
from the Federal Reserve.
   But analysts warn that a promise of cheaper money from the Fed
and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, by itself is no assurance of a
cheery start on the new year.
   The central bank acted last Tuesday afternoon to lower the
discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private financial
institutions, to 6.5 percent from 7 percent, where it had stood for
almost two years.
   The cut did not come as a total surprise to the investment
world. But most analysts who had been talking about the possibility
were projecting it for some time after Jan. 1.
   Thus the timing, as much as the substance, of the move was
interpreted as a signal that the Fed was stepping up the pace of
its efforts to ease credit conditions and relieve the pressures of
a developing recession.
   Among the tools at the Fed's disposal, the discount rate is
often described as powerful symbolic and psychological device. But
observers are quick to add that it is not a magic wand.
   In the midst of the last sustained bear market for stocks, the
Fed also sent a message of Christmas cheer to investors, cutting
the discount rate from 14 percent to 12 percent on Dec. 4, 1981.
   It was not until the second half of 1982, however, that stocks
bottomed out and the economy began its recovery from recession.
   In today's situation, furthermore, many analysts wonder if
cutting the price of money will be enough to get it moving faster
through the financial system.
   ``We're in a credit crunch all right, but it is not being
engineered by the Federal Reserve Board,'' asserts Charles
LaLoggia, a Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser.
   ``The credit crunch stems from the fact that the banking system
is awash in bad loans which are getting worse by the day. Both
bankers and banking regulators are now scared stiff of making new
loans.''
   A ``credit contraction,'' as described by James Grant in his
``Grant's Interest Rate Observer'' newsletter is ``a kind of malady
unseen since the 1930s.
   ``In a credit contraction,'' he says, ``borrowers are denied.
The principal rationing device for loans is not high interest rates
but low creditworthiness, the credit of the borrower or the
liquidity of the lending institution, or both.''
   Such misgivings helped to mute the celebration in the financial
world that followed the Fed's announcement. At Friday's close, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 2,633.66, up 39.85
points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.16 to 180.87;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
4.78 to 373.61, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was u 0.46 at 306.20.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 176.70 million shares a day,
against 155.85 million the week before.
   As if to dispel any illusions that the Fed could dictate the
level of interest rates, bond traders pushed rates on long-term
government bonds higher as the week progressed.
   Bond traders keep a continuous anti-inflation watch, manifesting
their concern every time the Fed takes a step toward stimulus that
they suspect might eventually increase inflationary pressures.
   At the moment, however, most forecasters don't see inflation as
a major menace to the markets any time soon.
   ``Inflation should prove to be much less of a problem in 1991
than it has been in recent years,'' contends David Blitzer,
economist at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   ``We expect to see some of the smallest price increases since
the mid-1980s, and have hopes that the gains against inflation will
be long-lasting ones.''

<HEAD>Soviet Economy in Shambles: Cows, Cars, Per Capital Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the Soviet Union, 15 million people are on
a waiting list for a telephone.
   Per capita income in this crumbling superpower is roughly that
of Mexico, and about one-tenth what it is in the industrialized
democracies.
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of wheat, yet
loses a fifth of its crop - 10 times higher than U.S. losses - and
must buy grain from the rest of the world to feed its people.
   Their cows produce only half as much milk as those in Western
Europe.
   The Soviet Union is an utterly backward nation, as portrayed by
the first Soviet-sanctioned international investigation of its
economy. It lags far behind the West in virtually every facet of
life, while squandering its rich natural reources and poisoning
its environment.
   The dispassionate, dryly-written report by the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and two major European development
organizations presents a portrait of worsening and inescapable
hardship for the Soviet people.
   More astounding statistics from the long-awaited report,
released Friday:
   - A Soviet household pays only about 3 percent of its income for
rent, which has remained essentially the same since 1928. That's
about one-tenth what a family in a major industrialized country
would pay. In a graphic demonstration of how the system has failed,
the report notes that nearly one in five families has been on a
waiting list for an apartment for more than 10 years.
   - In some regions, people are being exposed to environmental
health risks 10 to 100 times greater than those acceptable in the
West.
   ``Many of the industrial and agricultural regions of the USSR
are on the verge of ecological breakdown, posing an imminent threat
to the health of present and future generations,'' the
investigators said.
   - A recent consumer survey showed that nearly 90 percent of
basic industrial goods were in short supply. But because there is
practically no relationship between supply and demand, stocks of
machine tools are 10 or more times higher than in countries with
market economies.
   - As much as 40 percent of perishable crops like fruits and
vegetables goes to waste. The problem? Shortages of packaging
materials, storage facilities, outdated processing technology and
poor transportation. What's more, soil and water are being ruined
by environmentally insensitive production methods - and in the
process, food is being contaminated.
   - The Soviet Union has a large manufacturing sector that amounts
to roughly the same proportion of its gross national product as
similar industries in East and West Europe. But inefficiency is
rampant. The Soviets use 50 percent more energy to produce steel
than the Japanese, and many factories employ two workers for every
one in a similar Western job.
   - The Soviet Union produces more iron ore, zinc and nickel than
any other country in the world. It ranks second in production of
gold, aluminum and lead; third in copper production. Yet, with the
exception of production of gold, diamonds, platinum and nickel for
export, the metal and mining industries ``are characterized by
antiquated machinery and technologies with virtually no
computerization'' and dwindling resources, the report found.
   - It produces 22 percent of the world's oil and 40 percent of
global natural gas, but the Soviet Union's coal and oil output is
falling and domestic energy shortages are appearing. The report
blames ``outdated technologies, obsolete equipment and poor
maintenance.''
   While other oil-producing countries have enjoyed a windfall from
the spurt in oil prices brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis, the
Soviet Union's oil production and exports have plummeted - denying
the country desperately needed hard currency.
   The investigators concluded after their six months of study that
``the traditional centrally planned system has largely collapsed.''
   The bleak picture led the investigators to conclude that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recently approved economic reform
plan is too vague and too slow. They called instead for the
beleaguered Soviet citizens to take the bitter economic medicine of
ending price controls on heavily subsidized basic commodities while
accepting wage controls to speed the transition to a market
economy.
   While conceding that unemployment would rise and output would
fall, the experts at the International Monetary Fund insisted that
Gorbachev must move quickly to estblish private property rights
and let market forces drive reform in farming, manufacturing and
the crumbling distribution network.
   ``Ideally, a path of gradual reform could be laid out which
would minimize economic disturbance and lead to an early harvesting
of the fruits of increased economic efficiency,'' the study said.
``But we know of no such path, the more particularly given the
difficult starting conditions.''
   While calling for technical assistance to help the Soviets in
their efforts to discard seven decades of a planned economy, the
study said that massive amounts of Western aid would not be useful
right now.
   It said that without the implementation of a major and
fa-reaching reform program, a direct infusion of cash would be ``of
little or no lasting value.''

<HEAD>Welfare State's Future Questioned As Recession Looms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Northern Europe's welfare
states wonder how to keep their cradle-to-grave safety nets from
fraying in the impending recession.
   In the post-World War II boom years, the Scandinavian countries,
the Netherlands and West Germany introduced programs that spend up
to a quarter of the gross national product on welfare.
   Welfare spending now is outstripping the industrial growth that
was supposed to pay the bill. With growth slowing in many European
countries, some governments are considering cutbacks.
   With less money available for welfare, government officials
complain more loudly about people abusing the system.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers says his nation's welfare
system, which will cost the government 132.3 billion guilders
($79.6 billion) in 1991, is out of hand.
   In a recent report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, citing Holland's high income taxes and generous
welfare benefits, concluded that incentives to work are low. The
nation has an 11 percent unemployment rate.
   Dutch authorities recently failed to lure jobless Amsterdam
residents to the understaffed flower industry, even after the
government offered a car for every four workers to use for
commuting, as well as personal use.
   Denmark spends 40 percent of its budget on the 1.4 million
people - 28 percent of the population - who live on welfare. The
center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
hopes it can reduce welfare dependency by stimulating private
industry.
   Denmark has 20,000 people under 40 years of age getting
permanent government pensions of 3,709 kroner ($662) a month
because of drug or alcohol problems.
   In Europe, welfare helps the employed as well as the jobless.
The system commonly includes free medical insurance, sick pay,
disability and old age pensions, and child-care and unemployment
benefits.
   In Sweden, parents can qualify for benefits for taking time off
to nurse a sick child.
   ``The basic thing is that everyone should have basic
opportunities to ... take part in all activities within our
society,'' said Annchristen Filipson of the Swedish Social Affairs
Ministry.
   Scandinavian taxpayers can hardly be expected to dig deeper in
their pockets to pay a greater share of the welfare costs. Their
tax rates of more than 50 percent already are highest in the
industrialized world.
   Last October, Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party made the
first cuts ever in a social welfare system now costing 251.39
billion kronor ($45.13 billion), just over one-fifth of the GNP.
   The government is expected to cut 15 billion kronor ($2.69
billion dollars) from the welfare budget in 1991. The government is
also planning to cut sick pay rates from 100 percent to 75 percent
of a worker's salary for the first three days in an effort to
discourage malingering. Workers take an average 25 days of sick
leave a year.
   The welfare programs are usually funded by taxes paid by
employers and employees, and some are getting fed up.
   Ove Danemar of the Swedish Employers' Federation criticized
``the whole system'' because ``it stimulates people to work less
and to take more leisure time.
   ``The private sector can't bear it any longer,'' he said. ``It's
no longer consistent with a modern economy.''
   Critics say many of the benefits were begun in good faith but
have ended up being abused. During more favorable economic times,
the abuse was widely tolerated. But with the Continent entering a
recession, there is more clamping down on wasteful spending.
   Lubbers has vowed to curb Holland's Unsuitability for Work Act,
under which nearly 900,000 people get life-long disability pensions
of up to 70 percent of their last-earned pay. In the late 1970s,
some companies used it by dismissing unproductive employees,
passing the social cost on to the government.
   About one-third of the program's beneficiaries claim
psychological reasons for being unable to work. In a recent speech,
Lubbers said wryly: ``Looking at the statistics ... one has to
admit that ours is a sick nation.''
   This spring, the Dutch government is expected to make deep cuts
in the housing, education and cultural subsidies that complement
the welfare handouts, themselves equal to at least 70 percent of
the minimum wage. It has borrowed heavily and diverted money from
other programs to cover welfare costs.
   Only Germany is making large welfare increases, to pay millions
of former East Germans who are unemployed.
   Norway is slightly expanding its 125.8 billion kroner ($21
billion) welfare system, on which almost a quarter of the
population depends in some form or other. The Labor government has
added about one billion kroner ($166 million) to the bill since
coming into office last month and even the right-leaning opposition
Progress Party favors the expansion.

<HEAD>Modern Welfare States Guarantee Reasonable Income For All</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Europe-Welfare Woes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it began, welfare in northern
Europe was meant to stop the destitute from becoming a public
nuisance. Today's welfare states regard a fair income as a
universal right.
   The 8th-century emperor Charlemagne decreed that his nobility
should distribute food to poor peasants to keep them from joining
marauding bands of beggars.
   Europe always has known institutionalized charity, usually under
religious auspices, but elements of the modern welfare state
appeared only a little over a century ago, when cities were clogged
with working families.
   Mechanization and poor working conditions created the need for
health and accident insurance, while economic downturns created a
jobless class less easily absorbed than in farming society.
   Chancellor Otto von Bismarck gave Germany a compulsory health
insurance plan in 1883. Similar programs followed there in the next
few years for industrial injury, disability and old age.
   Norway's first state insurance law, which provided accidental
injury coverage for all, was passed in 1894, followed by laws in
1906 on medical insurance for the poor and old-age pensions in
1936.
   In the depression-ridden 1930s, Sweden and the Netherlands set
up loosely defined social welfare programs modeled on the New Deal
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   The Dutch program quickly became so essential that a minor cut
in benefits sparked three days of street riots in Amsterdam in
which five were killed.
   Cradle-to-grave welfare programs were advocated by Scandinavia's
dominant left-wing political parties after World War II.
   ``Everyone has the right to employment, a place to live,
education, social security and health and hospital systems. ... The
result is a society in which there are few truly rich or poor,''
says a book on social welfare published by Oslo's Aftenposten
newspaper.
   A late arrival on the welfare scene is Finland, a largely
agrarian nation where rural societies carried out their own
informal welfare functions.
   It was not until 1957 that Finland passed its first major
welfare law, the National Pensions Act. Its comprehensive
unemployment benefits law was not voted through until 1985.

   Welfare state benefits can be so
lucrative that even the recent offer of cars for personal use
wasn't enough to lure Dutch unemployed off the dole.
   Welfare recipients in Denmark and the Netherlands are frequently
entitled to subsidies that help pay their rent, child care, basic
furnishings and clothes.
   Coming on top of cash benefits, those add-ons often mean a
welfare recipient has a bigger income than a skilled industrial
worker.
   Authorities in Amsterdam recently offered the use of leased cars
to people willing to take jobs in the flower industry in the
Aalsmeer suburb. The plan failed because not enough people were
interested.
   Another plan to give jobs to the unemployed in the northern
village of Stadskanaal in the vital flower bulb harvest 60-miles
away also failed. The unemployed did not want to work that far away
from home, even though they were going to be given temporary
housing in the region.
   Desperate bulb growers eventually returned to their illegal but
tolerated practice of hiring seasonal workers from Poland.
   A Dutch Social Affairs Ministry study showed recently that a
couple getting 1,611 guilders ($964) a month in benefits would lose
5 percent if either partner were hired in a minimum-wage job that
pays the same, mostly because of expenses like commuting that
employers won't refund.
   The prospect of losing welfare subsidies on rent and other
basics often means that looking for a better-paid job is barely
worthwhile.
   Both the Netherlands and Denmark provide all parents with
child-rearing payments, which take the place of the dependent
deduction in the U.S. tax system.
   Questions have been raised whether rich Danish families should
be getting benefits of 5,600 kroner ($1,000) per year for each of
their children. Dutch payments are considerably lower.
   Spurred by high taxation, many welfare recipients, even those on
disability pensions, resurface in the so-called ``Black Economy,''
doing off-the-books blue-collar jobs in exchange for cash.
   The Dutch Welfare Ministry employs dozens of ``social
detectives'' who have full police powers to investigate such abuses
which defraud the state of tens of billions of dollars in welfare
benefits and tax revenue each year.
   Although the benefits can be many, applying for them can involve
a frustrating months-long trip through the bureaucracy to find out
which of the many different welfare programs applies.
   Rigid qualification rules often hinder a recipient's own efforts
to seek a job. Dutch unemployment benefit recipients can be barred
from attending job training programs because that's considered
abusing dole money as an educational grant.

   War could be at hand in the Persian Gulf. Eastern Europe is
beset by economic problems and ethnic tensions. The Soviet Union is
a struggling colossus that may be coming apart.
   Calls for democracy are heard in black Africa. In South Africa,
blacks and whites are negotiating a plan to end apartheid.
   Closer to home, French separatism threatens Canada once again,
two civil wars still sputter in Central America and, in the
Caribbean, Haiti is having another try at achieving democracy.
   As 1990 neared an end, The Associated Press asked some of its
correspondents to look forward into the coming year. These are
their reports:

   TORONTO - Canada's new year is filled with problems: the threat
of separation by French-speaking Quebec, an increasingly volatile
Indian population and a deepening recession.
   Coping with it will be the most unpopular government since
opinion polling began in Canada half a century ago.
   The latest polls say 58 percent of Canadians rate Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, who need not call an election for three years, as
``the worst'' prime minister or ``one of the worst.'' Support for
his Progressive Conservative Party has sunk to 14 percent.
   A commission created by the Quebec Legislature is holding
hearings and will make recommendations in March on what steps to
take after the failure of the Meech Lake constitutional accord in
June. That accord declared Quebec a ``distinct society'' and
provided for other constitutional changes sought by the province.
   A recent poll shows 73 percent of French speakers in Quebec
favor ``sovereignty-association,'' an ill-defined form of partial
independence from the central government.
   An explosion of violence in two Mohawk communities and a long
standoff between Indians and the authorities at Oka, Quebec,
ostensibly was caused by the village's plans to expand a golf
course on land claimed by the Indians.
   The confrontation, however, was symptomatic of Indian discontent
over the glacial pace of Canada's system for dealing with native
land claims.
   Matthew Coon-Come, grand chief of the Cree Indians of Quebec,
put the Indian attitude this way: ``If you continue to push people
to a limit and the federal government continues to ignore their
issues, they will retaliate.''

   MEXICO CITY - Central America is emerging from the civil wars
and upheaval of the 1980s into what it hopes will be the peace of
the 1990s.
   Civil wars still sputter in Guatemala and El Salvador, but
economic issues are edging out insurrection as the major issues for
1991 in Mexico and Central America.
   The region is buoyed by spreading democracy and financial
cooperation from the United States, but held back by problems that
have kept it poor: a shortage of arable land, inefficient
agriculture, low literacy rates and, although decreasingly,
insurrection.
   High expectations that came with peace generally have not been
met.
   Panama and Nicaragua enjoy U.S. aid and trade again, but are in
deep financial holes after years of turbulence, mismanagement,
fraud and U.S. trade embargoes.
   Both are under great pressures from within, and the Nicaraguan
government must deal with the recently ousted Sandinista National
Liberation Front, still the largest single political party.
   Sporadic peace talks aimed at ending the 12-year-old civil war
in El Salvador are to continue in 1991, but there are no signs of
resolving the main sticking point: the role, size and nature of the
Salvadoran military.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico hopes a proposed
free trade agreement with the United States will help lift his
country out of the Third World. Industries that may be hurt are
skeptical and political opponents claim Mexico will lose in such a
deal.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - Haiti's first democratic elections open
the way for a closer relationship with the United States.
   The Bush administration welcomed the Caribbean nation's break
with authoritarian rule in the Dec. 16 vote and congratulated the
Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide on winning the presidency.
   U.S. economic aid to the impoverished Caribbean nation is likely
to be restored despite wariness about the priest's leftist
rhetoric. The United States suspended $70 million in aid after an
election massacre in 1987.
   Elections are scheduled for 1991 in Guyana, Trinidad and
Barbados.
   President Desmond Hoyte of Guyana, turning away from past
nationalistic socialism, continues to encourage foreign investment
and economic aid from abroad.
   In Trinidad, Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson survived a
bloody coup attempt by radical Moslems last summer. Prime Minister
Erskine Sandiford of Barbados is struggling with a severe fiscal
deficit.
   A bill pending in Congress would allow Puerto Rico to hold a
plebiscite in 1991 on whether to become the 51st state, seek
independence or retain its 38-year-old status as a U.S.
commonwealth.
   Cuba may have to make further economic adjustments next year
because of declining trade with the Soviet Union. Washington is not
expected to seek warmer relations with Fidel Castro's communist
government.

   NICOSIA, Cyprus - War or peace in the Persian Gulf? Oil glut or
shortage? A return to normal in Lebanon or new disruption? New
moves toward solving the Palestine problem? Progress or defeat for
moderates in Iran?
   All these questions have global significance, and there are no
solid answers.
   A war over Iraq's seizure of Kuwait could change the balance of
power in the Middle East.
   If the U.S.-led multinational force succeeds in driving Iraq
from the emirate and incapacitating Saddam Hussein's military
machine, the regional winners would be Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria,
Egypt and Israel.
   Saddam wins if he keeps Kuwait, withdraws only partially or gets
out completely under circumstances that let him claim the invasion
led to progress on the Palestine question.
   If he keeps his million-member armed forces intact, along with
his program for developing nuclear weapons, he will be a continuing
threat to neighboring oil producers and Israel.
   Peace could bring an oil glut and prices of $10 a barrel or
less. War, by interrupting production in Saudi Arabia and other
gulf states, could push prices to well over $50 a barrel.
   In Lebanon, for the first time in nearly 16 years of civil war,
there is optimism that the battered former business center of the
Middle East is on the way back to normal.
   Skeptics abound, however, because armed militias remain active
outside the capital, such outsiders as Israel and Syria still
intervene and political quarrels continue.
   Syrian reconciliation with the United States and Britain, and
indications that President Hashemi Rafsanjani is gaining the upper
hand in Iran, inspire hope that the last Western hostages in
Lebanon will be released. Rafsanjani has moderated Iran's
revolutionary fervor and improved ties with some Western countries.
   A desire to end the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising, and better
relations between the United States and Soviet Union, could help
move Israel toward an international Middle East peace conference,
but no one is predicting it.

   MOSCOW - Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be challenged in 1991 as he
seeks to prevent the further economic and political collapse of the
Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev's international prestige remains high, as demonstrated
by the Nobel Peace Prize awarded him in October and his continuing
summits with Western leaders.
   At home, however, few Soviet citizens have reason to celebrate
the traditional New Year holiday. Store shelves are often bare in
major cities and many consumer items are scarce throughout the
country.
   Although he has helped reduce world tension by concluding arms
agreements, pulling back from Eastern Europe and withdrawing the
Soviet army from Afghanistan, Gorbachev has balked at the jump from
a planned to a market economy. Many Western analysts say that is
essential to boosting production.
   Six years after Gorbachev began relaxing 70 years of strict
Communist Party controls, ethnic unrest continues. Conservatives
have urged tougher measures to curb it.
   Gorbachev prefers a more moderate course: a new Union Treaty
that would hold the 15 Soviet republics together as a federation
rather than under central control. But some republics refuse to
take part in the talks and others oppose his plan to keep economic
control in the central government's hands.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have
declared independence and Moldavia shows signs of following suit.
Armenia is boycotting the talks because the Kremlin will not give
it control of the disputed Nagarno-Karabakh region.
   Russia, by far the largest republic, wants to sell its abundant
oil, natural gas, diamond and gold for dollars on the world market
rather than to the central governmnt for rubles, as Gorbachev
proposes. Some other republics are following Russia's lead.

   VIENNA, Austria - Eastern European countries lurch into 1991
under twin burdens of the communist economic legacy and age-old
ethnic jealousies.
   There are many questions: Will Yugoslavia continue to exist? Can
Romania and Bulgaria feed their people? Will Albania avoid
bloodshed? Can Hungary and Czechoslovakia make the psychological
and economic leap from East to West? Can Lech Walesa change from
Solidarity leader to president of Poland?
   After the uprising against Communist Party rule, 1990 was a year
for Eastern Europe to reorganize and take stock.
   Free elections were held by people who had seldom or never
experienced them. Problems hidden under the heavy hand of communism
crept to the surface.
   Yugoslavia's six republics, peopled by ethnic groups with deep
mutual suspicions, disagree on politics.
   They have elected governments that ranging from non-communist
oriented to the West, through nationalist to a continuation in
power of the Serbian Communist Party. The question for 1991 is
whether the fragile federation will survive.
   Ethnic disputes also sour relations between Czechs and Slovaks,
and between Romanians and the Hungarians of eastern Romania.
   Romanians and Bulgarians start the year wondering if they will
have enough food, heat and light for the winter.
   Albanians hope for their first experience of multiparty politics
and an end to isolation.
   Skyrocketing energy prices make economic reform more difficult
and urgent throughout the region.
   Czechoslovakia embarks in January on a crash program to create a
market economy. Hungary's leaders say 1991 will be the most
difficult year economically.
   Poland will follow Walesa's election as president with its first
fully democratic parliamentary elections, and continues its painful
economic reform.

   TOKYO - Much diplomatic activity in 1991 will focus on removing
remnants of the Cold War from the Far East, and surging export
economies will feel the pinch of a smaller U.S. market.
   In April, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president, is to pay
his first visit to Japan. Relations between the two nations have
been embittered by a dispute over a group of islands off northern
Japan the Soviets occupied near the end of World War II.
   Progress may be slow in resolving two of the region's most
troublesome problems.
   Talks between the premiers of North and South Korea began in
September and are to resume early in 1991. No major progress has
been made.
   Cambodian peace talks will continue in 1991 because of
international pressure, but experience indicates much more haggling
will be required before the government and guerrilla groups agree
to end the war.
   China will remain a country waiting for Deng Xiaoping, 86, and
other aging leaders to leave the scene.
   Recession in the United States could hurt superexporters like
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. Modest growth is
expected in Japan, despite the Tokyo stock market plunge and a
worrying land-price bubble.
   The Philippines can expect an economic crisis caused by natural
disasters in 1990 and soaring oil prices.

   NEW DELHI, India - It will be a year of challenge for democracy.
   India is committed to democratic rule, but torn by the worst
religious divisions since the subcontinent was partitioned on
religious lines at independence in 1947.
   In the closing months of 1990, the rise of Hindu fundamentalism
led to riots between the Hindu majority and Moslem minority that
rocked India's secular base. Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's
minority government may not survive and Rajiv Gandhi awaits a
chance to recapture the job he lost in 1989.
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, after succeeding the
secular-minded Benazir Bhutto, struggles to preserve an unwieldy
alliance that includes Islamic fundamentalists and secular
leftists.
   Afghanistan has never had a true democracy and chances are dim
that one will emerge in 1991. The United States and Soviet Union
say they will stop arming their proteges in the stalemated civil
war and want internationally supervised elections.
   Moslem guerrillas refuse to deal with President Najibullah of
the Soviet-sponsored government, however, and he refuses to resign.
   Bangladesh, where mass protests forced former Gen. Hussain
Muhammad Ershad to resign the presidency in December, will try to
conduct its first free and fair elections after 19 years of coups
and orruption. The former East Pakistan became independent in
1971.
   In Nepal, divine-right monarchy was abolished after a popular
uprising last winter. Elections are scheduled for spring.

   Further economic decline in Australia
and New Zealand will affect South Pacific island nations that
already expect a year of political unrest and uncertainty.
   Trade and aid vital to the impoverished islands is unlikely to
continue at current levels if the bad times in Australia and New
Zealand are prolonged.
   Australia is in its worst recession since World War II and no
recovery is predicted for at least six months. New Zealand, which
has one-fifth Australia's population of 17.5 million, is in even
worse shape.
   Elections are due in Western Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati and French
Polynesia. In Fiji, a regime installed by the army in 1987 says
November is a likely time for elections and restoration of
parliamentary government.
   Papua New Guinea, population 4 million, faces further political
instability and tribal unrest. Tension seems certain to continue on
Bougainville, where armed insurrection has closed the world's
largest copper mine and prompted intervention by the army.
   In American Samoa, Gov. Peter Coleman plans a constitutional
review aimed at winning more self-government.
   Island governments hope to renew an important fishing treaty
with the United States in 1991, and plan a showdown with Japan over
its refusal to accept further fishing restrictions.

   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - South American nations hope to see the
fruits of economic austerity programs they imposed in 1990.
   Argentina, Peru and Brazil brought monthly inflation down to
single digits from annual rates of several thousand percent.
   The first two project inflation for 1991 at 60 percent or less
and say their economies should grow by at least 3 percent - the
first growth in several years.
   For Brazil, the continent's largest country and economy, the big
question is petroleum. The difference between modest growth and
recession may be whether oil prices remain high because of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Venezuela has benefited from higher oil prices, which added $3
billion to its export income in 1990 and could increase the gross
national product by 6 percent in 1991.
   Chileans look forward to their first full year of democracy. In
March, Gen. Augusto Pinochet left the presidency 16{ years after
seizing power in a coup.
   Chile's economy is small, but healthy. Economic growth is
projected to more than double to 5 percent, with annual inflation
falling to 20 percent from 30 percent in 1990. Unemployment is
stable at 6 percent.
   Foreign debts are large in the region, but should become less of
a burden. Uruguay and Venezuela negotiated arrangements in 1990
that reduced interest payments substantially. Argentina hopes to do
the same in 1991.
   Several countries have trouble spots that could undermine growth
and stability. In Peru, the problem is guerrilla conflict; in
Colombia, cocaine traffickers; in Chile the pending trials of
military officers accused of human rights abuses and corruption
during the Pinochet years.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Demands for democracy and efforts
to turn away from disastrous economic policies offer glimmers of
hope through the war, famine and despair prevailing in much of
Africa.
   The collapse of totalitarianism in Eastern Europe helped the
cause of democracy and multiparty politics on a continent dominated
by authoritarian governments. From Kenya to the Ivory Coast, many
Africans shouted for democracy in 1990.
   Some entrenched leaders promised to ease control, including
Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, but many
Africans fear their governments will manipulate elections while
paying lip service to democratic change.
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa stunned the world by
promising to end apartheid and making some reforms, but the initial
euphoria faded as political leaders bickered and violence among
blacks took hundreds of lives.
   There seems little hope of change in much of Africa. Civil wars
continue in Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Mozambique. Fighting broke
out in Rwanda and the regime of Samuel Doe collapsed in Liberia,
accompanied by massacres.
   Many African nations face economic crisis and some are afflicted
with famine. While Tanzania, Mozambique and others move away from
discredited socialist policies, few African states have devised
workable alternatives.

<HEAD>Yeutter's Year-End Review Shows 1990 Was Hectic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
1990 will go down as ``the most hectic year for a secretary of
agriculture in the history of the United States.''
   Yeutter noted the months of debate and negotiation as Congress
wrote a new farm bill, the wrangling and eventual action on cutting
the federal budget, and, of course, the multilateral trade
negotiations.
   Except for the trade talks that are still to be resolved, 1990
stacked up as a pretty solid chapter in Yeutter's book.
   ``We would make a few changes if we had an opportunity to do
so,'' Yeutter said last week. ``But considering the complexities of
what's happening and the rapid changes in the world, I feel pretty
good about the year.''
   Yeutter, a hard-driving 60-year-old, gave his year-end appraisal
during a telephone interview with farm broadcasters and later with
a group of news reporters here.
   Despite Yeutter's enthusiasm for his job and accomplishments,
there are critics who contend the new farm law is a blueprint for
disaster. Yeutter disagrees.
   ``In my judgment, we emerged with a farm bill package that is
certainly respectable and probably a lot more farmer-friendly than
most of our farmers around the country now believe or realize,'' he
said. ``I think it'll turn out to be a bill that will serve
American agriculture very well over the next five years.''
   A favorite bone chewed by critics involves the budget-cutting
plan approved by Congress in October, which will hold down federal
spending by about $496 billion over five years.
   The Agriculture Department's share of the cut was $13.6 billion.
Many farm interest groups, and some members of Congress, complained
that agriculture was hit with too much.
   Meanwhile, Congress finished a five-year farm bill that includes
provisions to carry out the spending cuts assigned USDA, mostly in
the commodity programs that provide price supports and deficiency
payments to farmers.
   The new farm law will mean smaller subsidies going to farmers in
the next five years. Other provisions, including special
assessments on some producers, tighten the outlook further.
   ``A lot of folks pay attention to this supposed $13 billion cut
over five years ... which is a somewhat misleading number,''
Yeutter said. ``And they make a simplistic evaluation of the bill
that is not really an accurate reflection of a lot of its good
features.''
   The deep-seated concern of Yeutter's is the Uruguay Round of
trade negotiations launched four years ago under the auspices of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Yeutter, who was U.S. trade representative in the Reagan
administration, is a gung-ho advocate of liberalizing GATT rules so
that countries can produce and trade to the fullest of their
abilities.
   The U.S. view on agricultural trade is for fewer protective
import barriers, a reduction in domestic price supports and a
phaseout of export subsidies.
   Many countries sided with the United States during what was
supposed to be the windup of talks in Brussels earlier this month.
   But the push wasn't enough to convince the European Community to
compromise meaningfully on reducing farm subsidies, and the
Brussels meeting collapsed. Another attempt may be made in
mid-January.
   Yeutter and other advocates of freer trade have painted
optimistic pictures of long-range prosperity for farmers under
liberalized GATT rules.
   But there is a measure of ambivalence among U.S. farm
organizations and individuals regarding the Uruguay Round.
   A few condemn the talks outright as a sellout of longstanding
protection for small farmers. Others favor parts of the package,
while some go along entirely with the U.S. negotiators.
   The National Family Farm Coalition, which represents about 40
farm and rural advocacy groups, joined thousands of European
farmers who protested the GATT talks in Brussels on Dec. 3.
   Randolph Nodland, president of the coalition, said the U.S.
government ``negotiated a deal behind closed doors that trades away
American agriculture for what they hope will be gains in other
sectors of the economy.''
   The European farmers objected proposals that would reduce EC
subsidies and protection from imported commodities.
   Harvey Joe Sanner, president of the American Agriculture
Movement, a member of the coalition, said that ``unelected free
market zealots'' like Yeutter and Carla Hills, the U.S. trade
representative, have misrepresented the needs of rural America.
   Both Nodland and Sanner accused the Bush administration of
trying to use the 1990 farm bill to eliminate federal farm
programs.
   The National Farmers Union, while not a member of the coalition,
is asking the new Congress to change the 1990 farm law to prevent a
decline in farm income when its provisions take effect.
   ``The 1990 farm bill is simply a disaster where rural America is
concerned,'' said NFU President Leland Swenson. ``We want a 1991
version of the bill that revitalizes rural America.''
   Yeutter said the NFU's campaign for another farm bill was ``a
big mistake'' and that the next time around Congress might provide
even less money.
   The way it looks now, Yeutter will have a busy year in 1991,
too.

to a record of more than $604 billion last year, federal officials

   The growth rate accelerated in 1989, just as it has done every

for every man, woman and child in the country.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the
growth in health costs is alarming. It cuts some people off from

follow a projected advance of 4.1 percent for this year, according
to Thursday's Commerce Department report.
   It would be the weakest showing since business investment fell
3.1 percent in 1986.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans are less likely to own a home today
than they were a decade ago, as the nation's households have edged
away from their traditional family orientation, the Census Bureau
reported.
   Nationally, 63.9 percent of households owned their homes in
1989, down from 65.6 percent in 1980, according to the Thursday's
report, ``Homeownership Trends in the 1980s.''
   A major factor in the decline was a drop in ownership rates for
non-married couple families during the decade, the report said.

   In a quest to sweeten profits, the nation's
banks are holding off as long as possible before they cut their
prime lending rate.
   The normal rush among banks to follow a move in the prime rate
didn't develop after First National Bank of Chicago cut its prime
0.5 percentage point to 9{ Thursday morning.
   In healthier times, the nation's largest banks such as Citibank
and Chase Manhattan generally would have followed First National,
the nation's 13th largest banking company, by cutting their prime
rates as well, economists said. But banks are holding out as long
as possible to profit from the difference in their borrowing costs
and the interest borrowers pay them.
   First Chicago's move came one day after the Federal Reserve cut
the discount rate, its loan fee to financial institutions, by 0.5
percentage point to 6{ percent, in order to stimulate the economy
through looser credit. It was the first cut in that key rate since
August 1986.
   ``Banks are suffering through the worst earnings crunch in many
years, and in some cases are experiencing higher funding costs
despite the Fed's actions,'' said Fritz Elmendorf, spokesman for
the Consumer Bankers Association in Arlington, Va.
   A cut in the prime is watched closely because bankers use it as
a basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining
many types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. The prime
rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest
it pays on savings accounts or certificates of deposit.
   Though bankers deny they're profiting at consumers' expense,
economist Howard Sharpe disagreed.
   ``Yes, consumers are being gouged. But the problem is that if
the banks don't stay solvent, the consumer would get gouged even
more,'' said Sharpe, chief economist of Sharpe's Capital Market
Associates Inc. in New York.
   Federal bank regulators are pressuring banks to improve their
equity capital ratios, which help cushion a bank from failure. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. predicts 180 banks with total
assets of $70 billion will fail next year because of declining real
estate values and a souring economy.
   A number of banks are expected to improve capital levels by
slashing dividends this quarter in the face of rising loan losses.
A delay in a prime rate cut can slightly boost profits and make
things a little better for the grim quarter.
   A decision to delay a prime rate cut ``has very little to do
with raising capital,'' said Sharpe.
   Bankers say the cost of their funds still remains high, despite
the Fed's actions. The Fed has cut the federal funds rate, the rate
banks charge each other on overnight loans, three times this month
to 7 percent.
   ``The question is why hasn't (the funds rate) come down? Because
people are scared. They don't know which bank will be in trouble,''
Sharpe said.
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Fuji Securities Inc., said
the reason why bank costs haven't declined is that banks must still
pay relatively high rates of interest to holders of 3-month
certificats of deposit, one of the banking industry's major
sources of funds.
   ``Although there is an appearance that rates have gone down,
they have not come down for banks,'' he said. ``The prime rate is
set to move in line with the cost of bank funds.''
   Earlier this month, a handful of smaller banks cut their prime
rates to 9} percent in response to more subtle Fed policies to
encourage lending.
   The National Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank both cut
their prime rates 0.5 percentage point to 12} percent on Thursday,
which banking analysts called an indirect result of American
lending policies.

   With Christmas sales still lagging going into
the final weekend of the season, some retailers are intensifying
efforts to hook last-minute shoppers by increasing markdowns and
putting more merchandise on sale.
   But analysts said even an eleventh-hour consumer spending spree
- which most retailers are hoping for - won't be enough to turn the
season around.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said
Thursday it was expanding markdowns to include more merchandise
lines and stepping up advertising in hopes of attracting more
buyers.
   ``We are adjusting to the conditions,'' said Matthew Howard,
Sears' senior vice president for marketing, who described his
company's Christmas sales as ``slightly below expectations.''
   Sears, which two weeks ago moved up price reductions on winter
apparel lines, added new markdowns on merchandise including
exercise equipment, home lighting and electric blankets, Howard
said in a phone interview.
   The retailer was also moving up its annual furniture clearance
sale, which traditionally does not begin till after Christmas, he
said. It decided to extend a no-interest financing incentive for
major appliance buyers through Jan. 1.
   ``We felt all along that this weekend would be the one that's
most critical,'' Howard said.
   Sales have been at best sluggish for many stores. Burdened by
worries about their jobs, the economy and the Middle East crisis,
consumers have been spending cautiously and warmer weather has
stalled sales of heavy clothing and other winter merchandise.
   Retailers and analysts reported consumers were generally
shunning expensive gifts for cheaper and more practical items.
Walter Loeb, a retail analyst and consultant, said he has found
retailers are selling more smaller items, such as accessories and
cosmetics, this year.
   Across the country, retailers have had ``sale'' signs up for
weeks in an attempt to lure shoppers. Like Sears, they've increased
discounts as the days have gone by, and in the last days of the
season, some of the price cuts will be heavier.
   ``Starting last weekend, stores did push the panic button and
they're pushing harder to get sales,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, a
retail industry analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc.
   ``It's not working all that well - that's the scary part of
it,'' he said.
   However, Howard said Sears' earlier markdowns did produce
``significant, favorable'' results.
   At J.C. Penney Co. Inc., customers this weekend will see
markdowns of 50 percent on some items, spokesman Duncan Muir said.
   Penney's sales through last weekend ran about even with last
year, a disappointing performance, Muir said.
   ``With what we bought for Christmas, we can't be happy,'' Muir
said, referring to the merchandise Penney hasn't been able to move.
``On the other hand, we realize we're in a recessionary environment
and it's a difficult period.''
   One bright spot for Penney was a pickup in catalog sales, aided
by special promotions such as $15 off on a purchase of $75.
   ``We've got our fingers crossed'' going into the last weekend,
Muir said.
   But Loeb said that while ``a last-minute rush is now developing,
I still don't see the enthusiasm, the momentum that would make up
for a lot of this lost time.''
   Loeb predicted that when Christmas is over, the retail
industry's overall sales will be down 3 percent from last year.
After inflation is subtracted, the decline will be even sharper.
   Some retailers, who were satisfied with their sales earlier in
the season, seem to have lost some optimism.
   ``It's certainly difficult and we're looking forward to the
weekend ...'' said Ann Barkelew, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson
Corp. ``The concern always is, `Will we have enough people.'''
   In the first few weeks of the season, Dayton Hudson had said it
was pleased with its results.
   Through last week, Dayton Hudson's overall sales were about the
same as a year earlier, Ms. Barkelew said. Strong business at the
company's Target discount stores and Mervyn's apparel chain was
offset by poor sales at its Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's
department stores.
   Kmart Corp.'s vice president for marketing, Michael Wellman said
of this Christmas, ``It's a season that could be better.''
   However, he said, ``It's not over yet - I'm not pessimistic by
any stretch of the imagination.''
   Kmart has increased advertising during the last week before
Christmas, but ``that was all planned'' in advance, Wellman said.

<TEXT>
   Don R. Dixon bought a savings and loan in his
small Texas hometown, built it into a profit-making machine and saw
it collapse from gluttony.
   As the owner of Vernon Savings Association, Dixon collected fine
art and antique cars, hosted parties on the Potomac for
Washington's elite, jet-hopped to Europe's five-star restaurants
and even met the pope.
   Dixon may pay dearly for those heady days of the early and
mid-'80s.
   On Thursday, he became the latest and most important Vernon
executive to be convicted of defrauding its customers and
contributing to its $1.3 billion 1987 failure - one of the first
costly collapses in the savings and loan crisis.
   Dixon said during his seven-week trial that Vernon cost him
everything: ``I lost a lot of money. I lost my credibility. I lost
my career.''
   He may now lose his freedom.
   Dixon faces 115 years in jail and a fine of up to $5.75 million,
according to Marvin Collins, U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of Texas. He will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge A.
Joe Fish on Feb. 19.
   U.S. Magistrate John B. Tolle Thursday ordered Dixon held
without bond until his sentencing after proseuctors argued Dixon
had money overseas and might flee.
   Dixon is not a household name, like Charles Keating or Neil
Bush. But he is a one of the most celebrated and written-about
figures in the thrift crisis.
   ``Don Dixon was the highest of the high fliers among the savings
and loan crooks,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in
Washington after the conviction.
   Dixon and six other former Vernon officers also face a $540
million civil lawsuit brought by federal regulators.
   Dixon, 52, grew up in Vernon, a town of 11,000 near the Oklahoma
border about 130 miles northwest of Dallas. He got his start in
Texas business developing condominiums.
   During the trial, he said he bought Vernon Savings in 1981
because he was eager to become involved in all aspects of the real
estate industry, from financing to marketing.
   Congress and state legislatures were moving then to weaken the
restrictions that had kept thrifts primarily providers of home
mortgages. Dixon thought deregulation would save the industry and
help him make money.
   A month after buying Vernon Savings from R.B. Tanner, who had
founded it 21 years earlier, Dixon asked the thrift's board to
approve the $125,000 purchase of a small Western sculpture. His
buying spree was on.
   Dixon soon moved Vernon's main office to Dallas and then had the
thrift buy a fleet of jets, a yacht that he moved from Tampa to
Washington, D.C., a Colorado ski chalet, beach houses and a
Rolls-Royce and Ferrari dealership in California.
   The houses were needed as Vernon moved into the lucrative real
estate market, Dixon testified during the trial. ``It was important
for us ... that the savings and loan appeared to be part of that
community,''Dixon said.
   He became so well-known in southern California that the Roman
Catholic bishop in San Diego introduced Dixon to the pope during a
trip to Rome that regulators learned was paid for by Vernon.
   Dixon built Vernon on deposits handled by brokers for
institutional investors seeking high interest rates. He increased
the thrift's asset base more than 10-fold, including hundreds of
condominium units his real estate company was building.
   The thrift even put Dixon's picture on a promotional $3 bill
that also carried the slogan ``In Don We Trust.''
   But Vernon's flimsy loan base became apparent when real estate
values fell with the price of oil in the mid-'80s. Vernon was the
largest thrift failure in history at the time it was seized in
March 1987.
   Dixon was the 11th person and eighth Vernon officer convicted of
criminal wrongdoing that contributed to the thrift's failure.
   Woody Lemons, who was Vernon's chief executive officer, was
sentenced in April to 30 years in prison, the stiffest penalty yet
handed any figure in the savings and loan crisis.

<HEAD>Defense Contractors Warn of 8,000 Layoffs If Pentagon Scraps Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics
Corp. are sending notices to about 8,000 workers who could lose
their jobs if the Defense Department scraps the A-12 Avenger bomber
program.
   The defense contractors, both based here, are the prime
contractors on the $4.8 billion A-12 program, which has been
threatened because of cost overruns and schedule problems.
   A decision could come as early as Jan. 2.
   Both companies, like other defense contractors, have been hurt
by the broad slowdown in weapons orders since warmer relations
between the Eastern and Western blocs.
   McDonnell Douglas said Thursday it would notify about 4,000
employees at McDonnell Aircraft that they could be laid off as soon
as Jan. 2. Officials said the layoffs would not be limited to
people working on the A-12 program.
   Later Thursday, General Dynamics said it also would notify about
4,000 workers at its Fort Worth Division that they could be laid
off as early as Jan. 2.
   General Dynamics President Herbert F. Rogers said the company
was hopeful the Navy and the Department of Defense would continue
the program.
   ``The possibility exists, however, that the government will
terminate the program,'' Rogers said. ``As a result, we are
forewarning affected employees that layoffs could occur suddenly
and without as much notice as we have given during our planned
downsizing operations.''
   McDonnell Aircraft spokesman Jim Reed said that officials on the
A-12 team would continue to hold discussions with the Navy and the
Defense Department ``to resolve difficulties and assure
continuation of this vital national defense program on a mutually
satisfactory basis.''
   Both companies emphasized to employees that the layoffs would
occur only if the program were terminated or changed significantly.
   Last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the Navy to
justify the project or kill it because of what he called
intolerable problems.
   Defense Department audits on the program allege that hundreds of
millions of dollars in excess payments have been made to the two
companies.
   Earlier this week, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Los
Angeles Times reported that a separate Pentagon audit concluded
that the A-12 contractors have a ``possible chance of bankruptcy.''
Officials of General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas disagreed with
the audits' findings.
   Both companies have said they were cooperating with reviews of
the A-12 and that they believed they had solved the major technical
problems that had come up.
   The A-12 was envisioned as a deep-strike bomber with
radar-evading capabilities. It was meant to be the Navy's main
carrier-based attack plane for the early 21st century.
   Just eight months ago, Cheney assured Congress the A-12 project
was on schedule and within its then-classified budget. A Pentagon
Inspector General's report released earlier this month said Cheney
had not been aware of the project's serious problems because senior
aides had failed to communicate the schedule delays to him.
   The project is at least $1 billion over cost and at least 18
months behind schedule. Among the chief technical problems is
excess plane weight due to the thickness of the construction
material needed to make the plane strong enough for carrier
landings, said a Navy report released earlier this month.

<HEAD>Delta Air Lines Order Pushes Boeing to Record Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. said a $1.8 billion order from
Delta Air Lines helped it set a company record of $47.7 billion
worth of airplane orders this year.
   Boeing's 1990 tally tops by $1.1 billion its previous high mark
of $46.6 billion set last year even though the number of planes
ordered fell from 1989.
   Boeing said Thursday that 543 planes were ordered this year,
down from 883 last year. The biggest drop came in orders for the
short-haul 737-series - 162 planes this year from 463 last year.
   But the overall dollar amount of the orders increased because of
a sharp rise in orders for Boeing's most expensive jet, the 747-400
jumbo.
   This year, airlines ordered 172 of the 747-400s, which cost
between $125 million and $147 million each. Boeing received orders
for 68 of its 747-400s in 1989.
   Delta's order announced Thursday includes six new 767-300
twinjets, which sell for between $78 million and $86 million each.
Boeing also disclosed that Delta placed orders earlier this year
for three more extended-range 767-300s, an additional standard
767-300, nine 757-200s and seven 737-300s.
   Boeing spokesman T. Craig Martin said the previous orders
included options Delta converted to firm purchases this year and
several jets added to earlier orders during the final contract
negotiations for those orders.

   Chevron Corp. said it will charge $220
million against fourth-quarter earnings because of its previously
announced plan to sell its fertilizer operations.
   Analysts said they were not surprised at the size of the
after-tax charge or the timing of Thursday's announcement because
oil companies traditionally take writeoffs in the fourth quarter.
   Analysts also said they expected Chevron's fourth-quarter
profits to rise, pushed higher by the recent jump in natural gas
and crude oil prices.
   Chevron announced last month that it would sell its fertilizer
operations, which each year produces 1 million tons of nitrogen
fertilizer and 450,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer. The company
was not hopeful for the future of the business because of the
depressed farm economy.
   The $287 million-a-year business accounts for less than 1
percent of Chevron's $31.9 billion in revenues. It employes 600
people at plants in Richmond, Calif., Wyoming, Washington and
Oregon.
   Chevron, which hopes to sell the fertilizer operations next
year, did not identify potential buyers.

   The stock market showed little change today amid
strong cross-currents created by a quarterly ``triple witching
hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.92 to 2,637.38 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 468 up, 469 down and 496
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 74.36 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Trading was heavy at the outset as professional investors
engaged in maneuvers involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   Some of those contracts were settled on the basis of opening
stock prices this morning, and others as of the close.
   The witching hour, which falls on the third Friday of March,
June, September and December, was often a turbulent occasion for
the market in years past. But recently it has been taking place in
more orderly style.
   Beyond that specialized activity, analysts mostly were looking
for an uneventful session, with many investors getting an early
start on Christmas holidays.
   The markets will be open Monday for an abbreviated session
ending at 2 p.m. EST, instead of the usual 4 p.m. close.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, up \ at 48&rsqb;;
Exxon, up &rsqb; at 50}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up } at 31&lsqb;,
and DuPont, up \ at 37}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .34 to 180.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .32 at 306.17.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.73 to
2,629.46.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the

   A series of economic reports by the
Agriculture Department in recent weeks points to 1991 as a pretty
good year for farmers, although most admit there are uncertainties,
perhaps more than usual.
   One will be the reaction of farmers when they sign up for 1991
crop programs under the new farm law, which gives them more
flexibility to plant what they choose.
   A price for this freedom, of course, is a cutback in the acreage
that will be eligible for ``deficiency'' payments, the federal
subsidies designed to help support farmers' incomes when market
prices decline.
   Even so, department economists forecast that 1991 net cash
income will be in the range of $55 billion to $60 billion. That
would compare with a record of $59 billion estimated for 1990.
   Net cash income is the difference between gross cash income in a
calendar year and cash expenses.
   Although 1990 shapes up as a banner year for farm income,
generally, that doesn't mean all farmers everywhere have had it
good. And USDA hasn't closed the books on gathering all the
statistics on this year.
   Mitch Morehart of the department's Economic Research Service
says in the December issue of Farmline magazine that the seventh
annual Farm Costs and Returns Survey will begin in mid-February.
   The survey will be conducted over six weeks among 24,000 farmers
and ranchers in the 48 contiguous states. Information will be
gathered on their operations in 1990.
   Morehart said that of the six surveys so far, the one earlier
this year for 1989 was financially the best for U.S. producers.
   ``The (annual) survey tells us how much it costs to produce
various commodities in different areas and helps us maintain a good
understanding of the financial strengths and weaknesses of U.S.
agriculture,'' Morehart said.
   For example, here are a few of the highlights from the last
survey:
   -In 1989, net farm income was ``positive'' for 69 percent of the
farms, compared with 64 percent in 1988. Generally, that means the
farms operated at a profit.
   -Farm assets averaged $404,209 per farm in 1989, up from
$359,575 in 1988. Average net worth per farm was $356,191, compared
with $311,343 in 1988.
   -Farm operator debt was basically unchanged, averaging $48,018
per farm in 1989.
   -The number of farms with high debt continued to decline to 11
percent with debt-asset ratios above 0.4 at the end of 1989. That
means debts amounted to more than 0.4 - or 40 percent - of total
assets. Also, 48 percent of the farms had no debt at all.
   Morehart said the highest proportions of financially vulnerable
farms in 1989 were the Northern Plains, Mountain and Pacific
regions.
   The largest increases in the percentages of profitable farms
occurred in the Great Lakes states, Corn Belt, Northeast and
Appalachia regions. Dairy and tobacco operations led all production
specialties with 85 percent reporting positive returns.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An Agriculture Department trade report says
food exporters may want to plan ahead for selling products to the
over-60 crowd in a number of countries.
   By the year 2000, one in five people in the developed countries
will be over 60, according to United Nations statistics. By 2025,
one in four will be over 60.
   The report, included in the January issue of AgExporter
magazine, cited a number of observations based upon reports by U.S.
agricultural attaches and trade officers:
   -In France, older consumers will be demanding more healthful
foods, including low-fat, low-cholesterol and sugar-free products
enriched with vitamins and proteins.
   Special dietary food products will continue to be popular, but
the senior generation doesn't want products advertised as
``geriatric.''
   -In Germany, where 25 percent of the population will be over 60
by the turn of the century, older consumers have purchasing power
three times higher than that of the average 20-year-old.
   Indications point to a growing market for higher quality food
products, particularly those with a high degree of convenience such
as frozen foods and ready-to-cook meals.
   -In Spain, consumers are ``fairly conservative in their eating
habits'' and most favor fresh foods. So prepared, frozen or canned
items are not good bets in the Spanish consumer market.
   Fresh fruits and vegetables are popular, and prospects appear
excellent for sales of natural fruit juices to Spain's older
generation.
   -In Britain, older consumers can be targeted for fresh fish,
meat, fresh vegetables, breakfast cereals, brown bread, low-fat
butter, sunflower oil margarine, cheese, fruit juices and

   Microwaveable products also have a sales potential in Britain.
   -In Japan, about 12 percent of the population was over age 65 in
1989. By the turn of the century, about 16 percent will be. But
products specifically tailored to the older population are not yet
found in Japanese retail markets.
   One reason older foreign consumers offer less opportunity at
present for U.S. foods is that they are traditional eaters.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Soviet Union has bought more corn from the
United States, boosting purchases this week to nearly 1 million
metric tons, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Officials said private exporting companies sold an additional
300,000 tons to the Soviets under terms of the current long-term
supply agreement between the two countries.
   A sale of 266,500 tons of corn was announced Tuesday, the first
large U.S. grain order in two months. Another sale of 385,000 tons
was announced Wednesday.
   A metric ton of 2,205 pounds is equivalent to 39.4 bushels of
corn. The 300,000 tons would be about 11.8 million bushels.

<HEAD>Office Supply Chain Agrees To Be Acquired By Office Depot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Office Club, a leading office-supply
chain, has agreed to be acquired by Office Depot Inc. in a stock
swap valued at $137.8 million.
   Office Depot is the biggest chain in the United States with 121
stores in the Southeast, Midwest and Texas. The company, based in
Boca Raton, Fla., has sales expected to reach $630 million in 1990.
   Office Club, which announced the agreement Thursday, has 51
stores in nine Western states with sales this year estimated at
$285 million.
   The merged companies could reach $1.4 billion in revenues next
year, said Dan Wewer, an analyst for Robinson-Humphrey Inc. in
Atlanta. That would be nearly three times the $500 million in sales
he estimated for Staples Inc. of Massachusetts, another large
office supply chain.
   ``This combined Club-Depot entity will have more leverage with
their vendors and the manufacturers than will Staples,'' Wewer
said.
   Under the proposed deal, Office Club will move its headquarters
to Boca Raton but would continue to operate independently, changing
its name only in the Dallas-Fort Worth area - the only place both
companies operate stores.
   If hareholders approve the deal, each share of Office Club
stock would be exchanged for 1.194 shares of Office Depot, which
closed Thursday at $16 a share in national over-the-counter
trading.
   Office Club has 7.2 million shares outstanding. Its stock rose
$4.62{ a share to $18.12{ Thursday in over-the-counter trading.
   The move of Office Club's headquarters to Florida will result in
the loss of about 100 jobs, a company spokesman said.
   Mark Begelman, Office Club's chief executive, would become chief
operating officer of Office Depot, according to the companies.

   The stock market was mixed today amid strong
cross-currents created by a quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.93 to 2,636.38 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 550 up, 656 down and
556 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 104.75 million shares at
midmorning.
   Trading was heavy at the outset as professional investors
engaged in maneuvers involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   Some of those contracts were settled on the basis of opening
stock prices this morning, and others as of the close.
   The witching hour, which falls on the third Friday of March,
June, September and December, was often a turbulent occasion for
the market in years past. But recently it has been taking place in
more orderly style.
   Beyond that specialized activity, analysts mostly were looking
for an uneventful session, with many investors getting an early
start on Christmas holidays.
   The markets will be open Monday for an abbreviated session
ending at 2 p.m. EST, instead of the usual 4 p.m. close.

   Britain's trade deficit shrank to $1.84 billion in
November from $2.02 billion the previous month as imports declined
as a result of the nation's economic slowdown, the government said
Friday.
   However, the latest figure was worse than the $1.8 billion
deficit the financial markets had been expecting.
   The figures for Britain's current account, which includes
invisible trade such as services, were the same because invisible
trade has been in balance.
   Exports totaled $16.7 billion in November, up from $16.6 billion
in October, the Central Statistical Office said. Imports totaled
$18.5 billion in November, down from $18.6 billion.
   So far in 1990, Britain's merchandise trade balance has totaled
$32 billion compared with a deficit of $44 billion in the year-ago
period.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in quiet trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade
after two days of losses linked to the slow pace of export sales of
U.S. grain.
   The markets drew support from news that the Agriculture
Department offered to subsidize sales of 2 million metric tons of
wheat to Egypt and from Thursday's confirmation that the Soviet
Union bought 300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn, said John Frazier,
director of agricultural commodities trading for Gerald Inc. in
Chicago.
   He said prices also were helped by perceptions that livestock
producers in the western states will need to feed more grain to
their cattle to sustain them through the current cold spell.
   Trading activity was extremely light as some traders got an
early start on the Christmas weekend, he said. The grain markets
will be open Monday until noon and will be closed on Christmas day.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in Marh at $2.61 a bushel;
corn was \ cent to { cent lower with March at $2.34\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to } cent lower with March at $1.12\ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with January at $5.70 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were modestly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .28 cent higher with February at
76.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent higher
with January at 88.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent to .40
cent higher with February at 49.50 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .43 cent to .93 cent higher with February at 65 cents

<TEXT>
   Citing declines in advertising, The Boston Globe
said today it will reduce its work force by 100 full-time positions
through attrition over the next five years.
   The 100 positions represent about 5 percent of the full-time
staff at the Globe, which employs 2,075 full-time and 500 part-time
workers. Spokesman Richard Gulla says the reduction will be company
wide, with no particular department targeted.
   ``We are experiencing the same economic forces affecting other
companies,'' said William O. Taylor, publisher of the Globe and
chairman of the newspaper's parent company, Affiliated Publications
Inc.
   ``Advertising is down significantly this year, and the outlook
is cautious at best,'' he said. ``We think this is the least
painful way to address the need to be as cost-effective as we can
for the future.''
   The attrition program is another step in an overall cost-cutting
effort at the Globe, which began implementing budget cuts in the
spring of 1988. It has also included reductions in department
expenditures and in hours of some part-time staff.
   Last week, Taylor said he expected earnings to be down
significantly at Affiliated Publications and that the company
planned to raise the price of the Globe from 35 cents to 50 cents
in April in areas 30 miles outside the city.

<TEXT>
   Clarence L. ``Kelly'' Johnson, creator of
Lockheed Corp.'s secret Skunk Works aircraft factory and a leading
designer of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spyplanes, died today at
age 80.
   A Lockheed statement said Johnson died at St. Joseph Medical
Center after an illness of many years, but did not disclose the
illness.
   Johnson organized the Skunk Works in 1943 to build the XP-80
Shooting Star, the United States' first production jet fighter.
   Many aircraft and spacecraft bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning
in World War II, the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo
planes, the P2V anti-submarine patrol aircraft and the Agena
spacecraft, among others.
   Other designs on which he played a major role included the F-104
Starfighter, the first production aircraft to fly at twice the
speed of sound; the U-2, the first plane able to make a sustained
flight above 60,000 feet; and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird, the
world's fastest and highest-flying planes.
   The Blackbirds, recently retired by the Air Force, could fly
more than 2,000 mph and for long durations above 85,000 feet.
   Johnson, born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, went to
work for Lockheed as a tool designer in 1933. He went on to head
the Skunk Works for 30 years.
   He retired as a corporate senior vice president in 1975 and
retired from Lockheed's board of directors in 1980.

<HEAD>Ad Giant Omits Interim Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advertising and marketing giant WPP Group PLC
said Friday it won't pay its shareholders a midyear dividend
because of weak cash flow.
   The owner of the U.S.-based J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp;
Mather Worldwide advertising agencies said its priority was to
conserve cash.
   WPP has grown into the largest ad and marketing group in the
world through acquisitions over the past five years, but has seen
growth in its businesses slowed by the economic weakness in the
United States and Great Britain.
   ``We consider that it would not be in the best interests of the
company to pay the interim dividend for 1990 and therefore this
dividend will not be paid,'' WPP said in a letter to shareholders.
   The interim dividend was to have been for the six months ended
June 30 and was to have been paid on Jan. 2. The company said in
August it was going to pay a half-year dividend of 13.7 pence, or
26 cents, a share. Last year, the interim dividend was 11.3 pence,
or 21.5 cents, a share.
   WPP's decision to omit the dividend surprised analysts.
   ``This underlines how difficult (a position) the company is
in,'' said an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., who declined
to be identified. ``If it has to conserve cash to this extent it's
obviously pretty serious.''
   WPP also said it could be ``some time before the group can
resume the pattern of growth in profits and earnings experienced up
until a few months ago.''
   WPP reported a 77 percent rise in pre-tax profit to 46 million
pounds, or $87 million, for the first six months of the year from
26 million pounds in the same period a year earlier.
   However, the group warned in November that its full-year pre-tax
profit wouldn't match stockbrokers' estimates of about 110 million
pounds, or $209 million.
   The news prompted a 70 percent drop in the value of its stock
over two days, and Friday's announcement ignited another decline.
   The stock, which had been trading at 392 pence before the
November announcement, was down another 14 pence on Friday at 47
pence on London's Stock Exchange.
   Some analysts say WPP may have trouble meeting its debts, which
they said totaled 320 million pounds, or about $600 million.
   Barclays de Zoete Wedd is forecasting WPP will have a 1990
pretax profit of 85 million pounds, or $162 million. WPP's pre-tax
profit came to 75 million pounds in 1989.
   Its 1989 profit after taxes was 40.5 million pounds, or $77
million, on revenue of 4.4 billion pounds, or $8.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   Banks want a fiscal oversight board with
veto power over Philadelphia's budget as part of a $150 million
loan proposal to help the city avoid going broke, a newspaper
reported today.
   An eight-bank consortium also urged spending cuts, tax
increases, sale of city assets and privatization of some services
to end the city's chronic deficits, The Philadelphia Inquirer said.
   The banks' demands were spelled out in a 10-page confidential
proposal Tuesday, the newspaper said.
   City Solicitor Charisse Lillie would not discuss the proposal's
details, but questioned its legality.
   ``We are not going to agree to anything in this deal which is
illegal,'' she said today.
   She added that the city wouldn't ``agree to anything that would
overstep the bounds in terms of what the mayor is authorized to do
under the (city) charter.''
   A $375 million note issue collapsed in September amid worries
about the city's fiscal condition. The city's credit rating has
sunk this year to the lowest level for a major U.S. city.
   Unless it receives a cash infusion, the city has warned it will
not be able to meet the Jan. 4 payroll. The deadline has moved
several times as city officials delayed payments to vendors and as
some businesses and individuals paid taxes early.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode's administration last week proposed
selling $300 million in short-term notes to avoid payless paydays
for city workers. The notes were to be sold to local banks, two
pension boards and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc.
   The city Board of Pensions and Retirement, which oversees the
$1.5 billion city pension fund, scheduled a private meeting for
today.
   Joseph Herkness, a board member and union leader for the city's
white-collar employees, said no vote would be taken on a note
purchase today.
   The state Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which
oversees the $16 billion state teachers pension fund, was not
expected to meet until next week.
   Merrill Lynch skipped a 9{-hour negotiating session Tuesday,
leading to speculation the New York investment firm had lost
interest in the deal. Merrill Lynch spokeswoman Monica Prihoda said
Thursday the firm is ``still in discussions'' with the city.
   The Inquirer also reported Fidelity Investments, the Boston
mutual fund company, joined discussions on the note sale Thursday.
Fidelity spokesman Bill Benintende said Fidelity had not decided
whether to participate in the deal.

   The dollar was broadly higher in late European
trading Friday amid political uncertainty in Eastern Europe and the
continuing threat of war in the Persian Gulf.
   Gold fell slightly.
   Traders said the dollar continued to strengthen on concern about
the Soviet Union's political fragility following the resignation of
foreign minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze as well as the potential
for war in the Middle East.
   Signs of political volatility abroad tend to encourage currency
traders to buy the dollar, which is generally viewed as a safe
haven in times of upheaval.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 135.70 Japanese yen from
134.58 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 135.78
yen, and in New York at midday, the dollar was quoted at 135.38
yen.
   In London, the British pound weakened to $1.8835 from $1.9080
late Thursday. Sterling was quoted at $1.8833 in New York at
midday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.5295 German marks, up from 1.4997; 1.3120 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2880; 5.1980 French francs, up from 5.1035; 1.7255 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.6920; 1,153.00 Italian lire, up from 1,132.25;
and 1.1595 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1593.
   Selected midday rates in New York included: 1.5290 German marks;
1.3125 Swiss francs; 1,153.00 Italian lire; and 1.1602 Canadian
dollars.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $381.75 a troy ounce,
down from $385.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the precious metal
fell to a closing bid of $383.50, down from $385.00 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at $382.30.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.14 a

   The European Community Friday voted to
continue compensating the United States for reduced corn exports
into Spain and Portugal, avoiding a costly transatlantic trade war.
   Washington had been gearing up to increase duties on several EC
food and drink products if the EC had decided to end compensations
for losses in corn and sorghum exports to Spain and Portugal.
   The United States will now refrain from such measures and resume
negotiations with the Community to settle the issue for good by the
end of next year, officials said.
   The temporary settlement ended one of three farm disputes that
have been marring trade relations between the United States and the
12-member EC. The move was also expected to facilitate attempts to
restart the world trade talks that collapsed earlier this month.
   The talks, supervised by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, fell apart over farm subsidies that the United States wants
to eliminate but the EC hopes to maintain.
   The talks are scheduled to resume in Geneva next month.
   The corn dispute arose after Spain and Portugal joined the trade
bloc in 1986 and import duties were increased on U.S. corn and
sorghum feedgrains.
   One year later, the EC trade bloc agreed to compensate the
United States for losing an estimated $400 million in annual trade.
Two million tons of corn and 300,000 tons of sorghum now are
allowed into Spain and Portugal under reduced levies.
   The EC wanted to end the compensations this year, but granted a
one-year extension Friday after the the United States threatened to
retaliate with about $400 million in extra duties on EC products.
   The EC and the United States are still at odds over two other
issues. One is the banning of U.S. pork imports for what the EC
considers to be unsanitary slaughterhouse conditions in the United
States.
   The other is a U.S. ban on EC sparkling wines that contain a
Japanese additive which Washington thinks could be unhealthy.

   Shortly after the first of the year, The Associated Press will
begin transmitting live data from its new financial markets
computer system.
   We are now conducting tests of the new system. IT IS VITAL THAT
EACH NEWSPAPER RECEIVING DIGITALSTOCKS, DATASPEED OR SLOW-SPEED
STOCKS WIRES PARTICIPATE IN THESE TESTS.
   For the past several weeks we have been sending test tables on
Sunday, with advisories during the week telling members about the
tests.
   Beginning THIS WEEK (Dec. 17), we will begin transmission of
test data on a daily basis as well as Sunday. Tests of the previous
day's tables will be transmitted at 2 a.m. EST; weekly tests begin
at noon on Sundays.
   Checking the time-offs is important in determining which
transmissions are the test tables. That's because the header
information for the test tables is identical to headers for the
regular tables. Again, the test tables are those that arrive after
2 a.m. on weekdays and after noon on Sunday.
   The tests are for stocks, bonds, options and stock-related
summaries (up-down, leaders, what stocks did, most active, etc.).
Commodities and futures tables will be tested later, so you won't
see those tables now.
   Please ensure that the test transmissions are 1) captured, 2)
typeset and 3) evaluated as soon as possible, and 4) please let us
know the results. This is essential to a smooth transition to the
new system.
   Although the tables are transmitted according to the same
standards that have always applied, it cannot be byte-for-byte
identical with data from the old computer system. This especially
applies to non-printing spacing characters, which may appear in a
different sequence, and tape-visible numbers.
   If everything looks fine, please advise your AP bureau chief. If
there are any problems setting the tables, call or send the typeset
copy quickly with an explanation to:
   Diane Wright
   The Associated Press
   50 Rockefeller Plaza
   New York, NY 10020
   (212) 621-1568
   Any questions about these tests or this advisory should be
directed to Ms. Wright at the above number. Many thanks for your
cooperation.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said Friday it
raised $120,000 to provide Christmas dinners to 2,100 needy
families in the city.
   In the annual fundraising event, dinners will be delivered to
the homes of needy families by the Boys Club of New York, the
Children's Aid Society and the Roman Catholic church St. Vincent de
Paul.
   The NYSE last year raised more than $144,000 in the program. But
an exchange spokeswoman, Cathy Maroney, said more dinners would be
distributed this year because Windows on the World, a restaurant in
the World Trade Center, reduced the cost of preparation.
   The dinners include 16-pound turkeys and will be distributed to
families on Saturday and Monday, the NYSE said. Last year, 2,047
dinners were distributed.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. said Friday it has begun
an internal probe as a result of Israel's investigation into
whether Israeli military officers accepted bribes while buying
U.S.-made equipment.
   General Electric is a major producer of jet engines used on
military and civilian aircraft in the United States and overseas.
GE's main jet engine plant is in the Cincinnati suburb of Evendale,
with a sister plant in Lynn, Mass.
   In Israel, prosecutors said Thursday they had agreed to a plea
bargain by a senior Israeli Air Force officer accused of accepting
millions of dollars in bribes while purchasing U.S. military
equipment. According to the deal, Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan will be
required to return $10 million in bribes and kickbacks he allegedly
accepted while heading the Defense Ministry's department of
military acquisitions in New York in 1984-85.
   The scandal shocked Israel's military establishment and raised
concerns it might jeopardize the $1.8 billion in U.S. military aid
Israel receives annually.
   Spokesman George Jamison said GE began an internal investigation
upon learning of the Israeli investigation. He declined to discuss
any findings so far.
   ``We've advised the U.S. government of our investigation. We're
cooperating fully with the U.S. government,'' Jamison said from GE
headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.
   Col. Rick Oborn, a Defense Department spokesman in Washington,
was unavailable for comment early Friday.

   More than 100,000 current magazines bound for
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia were hung up in a Minnesota printing
plant today because of a mix-up over cigarette advertising on their
covers, but a spokesman at the Pentagon said they would be on their
way in a week.
   The magazines were scheduled for shipment overseas by Operation
Desert News, an organization formed in Charleston, S.C., to provide
U.S. military personnel in the Persian Gulf with reading matter.
   Officials of the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees such
shipments, discovered Thursday that the magazines were being bound
in special outside covers containing a Camel cigarette
advertisement but not containing a military disclaimer about
tobacco products.
   The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is the only corporate sponsor of
Operation Desert News.
   ``We're going to print the declaration on the front and take the
camel off the back,'' said Lt. Col. Hery Wyatt, spokesman for
Defense Logistics. He said officials of the St. Cloud, Minn., firm
that is doing the printing told the agency the task could be done
in a week.
   Wyatt said the covers bear the name of the R.J. Reynolds Co. on
the front and the Camel ad on the back.
   He said lawyers at the Pentagon and at the U.S. Central Command
at MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., which screens the content of
magazines bound for the gulf, worked out the new arrangement.
   ``Normally when it's a cigarette company, the Defense Department
requires a disclaimer be put on it, that they are not sanctioning
the troops smoking,'' said Major Maureen DeCiantis, a public
affairs officer for Central Command. ``In this case it was not
done, because Desert News didn't know they had to do it, and we
didn't know they had a tobacco company as a backer.''
   Both Wyatt and Staff Sgt. Jefferson Sammons of the Central
Command public affairs office said that as first submitted to
Central Command the covers did not bear the advertising matter.
   Tim Karnes, a Charleston publisher who organized Operation
Desert News, said the organization submitted a rough draft of the
first page of the cover, which might not have contained the R.J.
Reynolds identification, and did not submit the back page.
   He said the organization did not realize any disclaimer would be
needed, but ``everybody involved knew that R.J. Reynolds was the
sponsor.''
   ``It's magazines that we're sending,'' Karnes said. ``We're not
sending cigarettes.''
   He said the organization is seeking other corporate sponsors.
   Karnes, publisher of Auction Guide magazine, spoke by telephone
from Acapulco, Mexico, where he is attending a family gathering
over the Christmas holiday.
   ``The communication just kind of got snafued,'' DeCiantis said.
   Dean Foster, a spokesman for Operation Desert News in
Charleston, said, ``The Defense Department and Operation Desert
News are working toward the same goal, and that is to get the
magazines to the troops as expediently as possible.''
   The magazines are sent aboard ships. The ocean passage takes
about three weeks.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Bids For Confidence With Lower Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve
are going to rescue the economy, the central bank needs help from
consumers, banks and businesses.
   The banks seem to be starting to go along.
   First National Bank of Chicago, the nation's 13th-largest U.S.
banking company, was the first major lender to follow the Fed's
lead, lowering its prime rate from 10 percent to 9.5 percent.
Smaller banks also moved to ease their prime rates as well.
   Interest rates on many business and consumer loans, like home
equity lines of credit, are tied to the prime.
   Lower borrowing costs for consumers, combined with optimism that
the recession might be short lived, could prompt many to buy a new
car, dishwasher or even a new house.
   Slouching consumer confidence has been one of the darkest clouds
hanging over this recession.
   In November, the Conference Board, a business-supported research
group, reported its consumer confidence index fell near levels last
seen in the depths of the 1982 recession.
   The Conference Board's survey found more people expecting higher
unemployment and weaker business conditions in the coming months
and were scaling back plans for major purchases.
   Businesses have also started to change their plans based on
economic pessimism. The Commerce Department reported last week that
businesses planned to increase spending to modernize by a scant 0.4
percent in 1991.
   This year, modernization spending increased 4.1 percent.
   ``There are a lot of different ways you send a message.
(Lowering) the , fed funds rate is a very technical message. The
discount rate is still another way of communicating and the Fed was
trying to do something dramatic, but the prime rate is very visible
to a lot of people,'' said Maury Harris, chief economist at
PaineWebber Inc.
   Fluctuations in the discount rate - interest the Fed charges to
lend money to banks - have little direct affect on the economy and
the move to lower the rate from 7 percent to 6.5 percent was seen
widely as symbolic.
   In an economy driven by perceptions, symbols are important.
   The Fed's message was clear and sent loudly. Announced in the
afternoonon on an otherwise slow news day, many editors at
newspapers and broadcasting stations treated the move as the day's
top story rather than a purely business news development.
   Recent moves by the Fed to lower the federal funds rate -
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans - to 7 percent
have been largely left to the business pages.
   ``The Fed wanted to tell consumers they are going to do
something. ... The message to banks was: `think about lowering
interest rates,''' said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland
Montagu, a division of Midland Bank.
   The message to everyone was that the Fed has made the recession
its top priority, rather than the anti-inflation tight money
policy.
   This summer's tight-money policy, which was intended to bring
the economy into a ``soft landing'' to squeeze out inflation, was
blown off course when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The invasion and higher oil prices, which took money out of
consumers pockets, on top of the tight money policy, pushed the
economy into recession, Fabbri said.
   Although lower interest rates may help pull the economy around,
they may not hold the quick answer, Fabbri said.
  It will take six to 12 months for increased borrowing and
increased bank profitability to lead the way to recovery, he said.

   More than 40,000 workers at two of the Big Three
automakers will get longer Christmas and New Year's breaks because
of anemic car and truck sales.
   The workers, at 17 General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
assembly plants, will still be getting nearly all of their normal
pay through the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit program. But the
temporary layoffs have still caused worry about the economy and the
auto industry in particular.
   ``It's scary,'' said Elaine Swiderski, financial secretary for
United Auto Workers Local 435 at General Motors Corp.'s assembly
plant in Wilmington, Del. ``Sometimes your (SUB) checks are
delayed.''
   Officials for each of the Big Three have predicted a sharply
lower rates of sales for cars and trucks in 1991, even if war does
not break out in the Middle East.
   Sales could plunge if shooting erupts.
   General Motors Corp. said it would shut down 14 assembly plants
the week of Jan. 2, while Chrysler will idle three. The shutdowns
will affect 41,650 workers.
   GM plants down until Jan. 14 are Lansing Reatta, Detroit, Flint,
Pontiac East, Lansing B, and most of the Hamtramck factory, all in
Michigan; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Fairfax, Kan.; Oklahoma City; North
Tarrytown, N.Y.; Van Nuys, Calif.; Linden, N.J.; and a van plant in
Lordstown, Ohio.
   GM said Wilmington will resume production Jan. 7.
   Chrysler will keep its St. Louis, Mo., car and Toledo, Ohio,
Jeep plants down until Jan. 21. The company's Sterling Heights,
Mich., car assembly plant will be down until Jan. 28.
   Ford Motor Co. said Friday all of its plants will operate the
shortened work week beginning Jan. 2. All three automakers' plants
shut down next week for the traditional holiday vacation.
   Ford has not announced which plants would operate the week of
Jan. 7.
   Swiderski said a temporary layoff isn't bad if employees know
they will be returning to work soon. But if the layoff is extended
or the number of temporary layoffs begins to mount, perceptions may
be different.
   ``How is it going to be in the future?'' she wondered. ``The way
the economy looks to me, it's scary. People aren't spending (money)
like they used to. People don't know what the heck is going to
happen.''
   The supplemental payments workers will receive are included in
United Auto Workers union contracts with the Big Three. The program
is aimed at providing employees 95 percent of their regular pay
when they are laid off from plants because of slow sales.

   Stock prices hovered near Thursday's closing
levels today amid strong cross-currents created by a quarterly
``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.41 to 2,638.86 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 668 up, 760 down and
532 unchanged.
   Trading was heavy at the outset as professional investors
engaged in maneuvers involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   Some of those contracts were settled on the basis of opening
stock prices this morning, and others as of the close.
   The witching hour, which falls on the third Friday of March,
June, September and December, was often a turbulent occasion for
the market in years past. But recently it has been taking place in
more orderly style.
   Beyond that specialized activity, analysts mostly were looking
for an uneventful session, with many investors getting an early
start on Christmas holidays.
   The markets will be open Monday for an abbreviated session
ending at 2 p.m. EST, instead of the usual 4 p.m. close.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up | at
58&lsqb;; Exxon, up \ at 50|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up { at
30~, and Ford Motor, up | at 26&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .26 to 180.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .86 at 305.63.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 169.74 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>General Dynamics Reports Major Reorganization in Fort Worth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. on Friday announced a
major reorganization of its Fort Worth Division, including the
reassignment of the director of the troubled A-12 Avenger bomber
program.
   The St. Louis-based defense contractor said the reorganization
would emphasize five business groups considered vital to the
division's future, including the A-12 program, which the Pentagon
has threatened to scrap because of cost overruns and schedule
problems.
   The company said Charles Anderson, the A-12 program director,
was reassigned as division vice president of a new unit called
Special Programs and Other Business.
   His replacement is Ted Webb, the former head of the F-16 fighter
jet program, who retired last year.
   Company spokesman Mike Hatfield said Anderson's transfer was
part of an overall restructuring of the A-12 program. He said the
reorganization had been in the works for several months and was not
tied exclusively to the program.
   General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas Corp. are the prime
contractors on the troubled $4.8 billion bomber program.
   On Thursday, the companies announced they were sending notices
to 8,000 workers warning they could be laid off if the Navy
scrapped the program. A decision is expected as early as Jan. 2.
   Last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the Navy to
justify the project or kill it because of what he called
intolerable problems. Defense Department audits allege that
hundreds of millions of dollars in excess payments have been made
to the two companies.
   Earlier this week, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Los Angeles
Times reported that a separate Pentagon audit concluded that the
A-12 contractors have a ``possible chance of bankruptcy.''
Officials of General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas disagreed with
the audit's findings.
   Both companies have said they were cooperating with reviews of
the A-12 and believed they had solved the major technical problems
that had surfaced.
   Under the reorganization announced Friday, a number of related
electronic products were combined in a Military Electronics
business group. Special projects and other separate business
elements were combined in the Special Programs and Other Business
unit.
   Each group will be headed by a division vice president, who will
have expanded authority and responsibility and will report directly
to company president Herbert F. Rogers, who is also general manager
of the Fort Worth Division.
   The changes are effective immediately and will be followed by
other realignments within the division to focus resources on the
five key business areas, the company said.
   Those areas include the F-16 fighter jet and the Advanced
Tactical Fighter program.
   General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defense
contractor behind McDonnell Douglas. It has nine divisions and six
major subsidiaries, all involved in defense work except Cessna
Aircraft, which makes general aviation aircraft.

   The Japan Defense Agency selected a
General Electric Co. engine to power the FS-X fighter jet in a deal
worth at least $100 million, GE's Aircraft Engines division
announced Friday.
   The F110-GE-129 engine is to be used aboard the FS-X aircraft,
which are modeled after General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 fighter jets.
The first production versions are to be completed by 1999.
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and General Dynamics are
jointly developing the FS-X jets.
   The F110 engines for those aircraft are to be produced in Japan
under license from General Electric, the company said. GE Aircraft
Engines will provide some engine assembly and technical support.
   The amount of engine content to be produced by Japanese
manufacturers will be subject to guidelines from the U.S.
Department of Defense.
   GE said the Japan Defense Agency had also evaluated the
F100-PW-229 engine produced by competitor Pratt &amp; Whitney, a
division of United Technologies Corp. of Hartford, Conn.
   ``We at GEAE are delighted with the decision of the JDA, for
which we thank them,'' said Brian Rowe, senior vice president of GE
Aircraft Engines, based in Evendale.

   Some satellite dish owners in Central and South
America no longer will get Cable News Network for free.
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner, said Thursday it
plans to begin scrambling its CNN feed south of the border.
   The company said it will make the switch next month when it
begins beaming the Turner Network Television movie channel to the
region on a scrambled signal. TBS said the dish owners were
receiving the service illegally for two years.
   TBS feeds its 24-hour news channel into about 35,000 hotel rooms
and 250,000 homes in the region and sells its signal to about 35
broadcast clients, TV stations and networks.
   South American satellite dish owners who want to continue
receiving CNN would have to buy a receiver and decoder from an
equipment company, at a cost of about $1,300, and then enter a
contract with CNN to unscramble the feed.
   Although CNN does not now contract with individuals, spokeswoman
Kitsy Riggall said the company would ``certainly work with anybody
who wants to receive it.''
   TBS, which has been scrambling its signal in the United States
for five years, said it was concerned about ``weak copyright laws
in the region.''
   The company said it has no plans to scramble CNN's signal to the
rest of the world.

   Stock prices turned in a mixed showing today
amid strong cross-currents created by a quarterly ``triple witching
hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.13 to 2,640.59
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 722 up, 775 down and
498 unchanged.
   Trading was heavy at the outset as professional investors
engaged in maneuvers involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   Some of those contracts were settled on the basis of opening
stock prices this morning, and others as of the close.
   The witching hour, which falls on the third Friday of March,
June, September and December, was often a turbulent occasion for
the market in years past. But recently it has been taking place in
more orderly style.
   Beyond that specialized activity, analysts mostly were looking
for an uneventful session, with many investors getting an early
start on Christmas holidays.
   The markets will be open Monday for an abbreviated session
ending at 2 p.m. EST, instead of the usual 4 p.m. close.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up } at
58\; Exxon, up &rsqb; at 50}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up | at
31, and Ford Motor, up { at 26.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .42 to 180.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .83 at 305.66.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 188.40 million shares with an
hour to go.

   The Soviet Union's most recent political turmoil
has become another wild card faced by Western oil companies
examining possible deals for exploring, drilling and exporting
crude from its vast reserves.
   ``I'm sure it delays everything,'' said John Lichtblau,
president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ``One of
the problems they have with making deals over there is that they
didn't know how reliable their partner was, who their partner
was.''
   Texaco Inc., one of several major petroleum explorers interested
in the Soviet Union, is puzzling to figure out who to negotiate
with among the many layers of Soviet bureaucracy, spokesman David
Dickson said.
   ``Is it the Soviet government?'' Dickson said. ``Is it the
Russian republic? Is it the local authorities?''
   Apparently, none of the majors have gone beyond signing
agreements that commit them to exploring possibilities of joint
ventures, experts said.
   ``Our discussions are still too preliminary to make any
judgments about possible outcomes,'' Exxon Corp. said in a
statement. Other oil companies interested in Soviet ventures
include Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp., British Petroleum and ARCO.
   Experts say Chevron might be the most advanced in getting a deal
with the Soviets. But, like the others, Chevron will say little
about the status of its plans.
   ``We are in the final stages of negotiations on a joint
venture,'' spokesman Larry Shushan said Friday. ``We're not really
in a position to speculate as to timing.''
   Chevron's deal would be in the large Tengiz oilfield in the
northeast Caspian Sea region, which the Soviets have estimated
could contain 25 billion barrels of oil. That would be enough to
supply all the American oil needs for decades.
   The uncertainties facing the oil giants were heightened this
week, when Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze quit,
shocking President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and stirring concerns that
a dictatorship could emerge or that more troubles could develop.
   ``It could be a detriment,'' Exxon spokesman Lance Lamberton
said. ``I can't quantify it.''
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, but its
industry has fallen on hard times after peaking out at 12.5 million
barrels of crude oil a day in 1988.
   ``It's now down to 11.3,'' Lichtblau said. ``The general
assumption is that it will continue to decline to under 10 million
barrels a day in couple of years. That's a huge decline. If nothing
is done, it could go down to nine perhaps.''
   The problem is technology. The Soviets have extracted much of
the oil that was relatively easy to obtain and they are unable to
get to some additional reserves, which will bring in needed hard
currency, without help from the West.
   Big oil companies looking toward the Soviet Union can envision
the potential for vast production, possibly even enough to cut back
on the market clout wielded by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   The uncertainties of dealing with the Soviets are obvious, but
the recent Persian Gulf crisis shows that the West already depends
on an uncertain energy supply. Several potentially unstable sources
of energy are logically better than only one, strategists say.
   ``They're not likely to be unavailable at the same time, since
their politics are totally different,'' Lichtblau said.
   It's unclear how much new oil could be found in the Soviet
Union, although some experts say higher production could easily
equal that of a moderate-sized OPEC member.
   For now, efforts by U.S. companies involve enhanced production
of crude that has already been discovered rather than
``wildcatting,'' or looking for new oil fields.
   In one such venture, a private company, Synergy Trading Corp.,
of Greenwich, Conn., hopes to set up a deal worth at least $250
million for enhancing on-shore wells in the Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan, and a deal worth more than $1 billion for developing
new off-shore wells there.
   William F. Wilson, who handles equity crude deals for Synergy,
estimated the on-shore project could produce 15 to 20 million
barrels of oil a year.
   ``Off-shore could be double that,'' Wilson said Friday.
   It remains uncertain how much of the oil Synergy and its
partners could obtain. The Soviets will not let Western companies
get involved in existing production, but they have expressed a
willingness to let oil companies claim a portion of new oil they
can produce.
   Synergy's executives, who have years of experience in making
grain and oil deals with the Soviets, said they can get approval
for the on-shore project from Azerbaijan authorities, while the
off-shore deal needs to be cleared by Soviet authorities in Moscow.
   Synergy said political troubles in the Soviet Union and its
republics can slow things, but the executives don't believe it will
stop any deals.
   ``You've just got a longer fuse in these projects,'' Wilson
said.

<HEAD>U.S. and British Officials Encounter Turbulence Over Heathrow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and British government officials suspended
negotiations Friday on their dispute over granting United Airlines
and American Airlines access to London's Heathrow airport.
   The two sides, which held talks on Thursday and Friday,
discovered a gap in their positions and said they had not set a
date for resuming talks.
   No progress was being made in the negotiations, said Cyril
Murphy, a United Airlines executive.
   ``The United States has indicated it is prepared to pay the
British a reasonable price for allowing a timely succession at
Heathrow,'' said Murphy.
   ``The British have come back and put on the table a long list of
demands and essentially said, `We want everything on our list.' The
U.S. has gone back and said, `The price is too high. Why don't we
negotiate?' and that's where progress stops.''
   The British offered to meet again in January, said a spokesman
for the British Department of Transport, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   American said Sunday it would buy TWA's London and other
overseas routes for $445 million. United agreed in October to buy
most of Pan Am's London routes for $400 million.
   The airlines are trying to secure access to Heathrow, which is
Britain's most attractive airport because it is closer to central
London, is served by the subway system and offers more air
connections.
   But British law has barred new entrants from the congested
airport since 1977 and diverted them to London's Gatwick and other
British airports.
   United and American are hoping to get in through an air services
agreement between the United States and Britain allowing successors
to existing U.S. airlines to assume their Heathrow rights.
   Both airlines have said the deals will not proceed if they don't
win access to Heathrow.
   An American government source knowledgable about this week's
negotiations said officials ``identified that there was a gap
between our perceptions in the best way to go forward on the
issue.''
   ``We're still working on resolving the issue. We have not come
to an agreement as of yet,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman for the British Department of Transport said the
sides had ``a useful exploratory meeting'' at which they identified
and explored their differences.
   A source at one of the U.S. airlines said the British officials
want to restrict the right of U.S. airlines to fly from London
onward to continental cities. Britain also wants to give another
British carrier access to Heathrow.
   The government also wants any new U.S.-British routes into
Heathrow to be granted to British carriers, and wants more access
to the U.S. domestic market, he said.
   The British goverment is not expected to make a decision until
at least mid-January, after the Civil Aviation Authority has
completed a report on the allocation of landing slots at Heathrow.

<HEAD>The National Plans to Boost Cover Price to 75 Cents Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite falling short of circulation goals, the
sports newspaper The National said Friday it will boost the daily
cover price by a quarter to 75 cents, effective Jan. 21.
   In addition, the newspaper said it would test a $1 daily price
for one or two of its 10 metropolitan editions. Specific editions
have not yet been selected for the test, said spokesman Stephen
Hammond.
   The move comes as the 11-month-old newspaper has yet to prove
there are enough readers to sustain the first all-sports daily in
the United States.
   It also comes as the weakest advertising market in 15 years has
driven newspapers to find alternate methods of generating more
revenue.
   In boosting prices, The National said it was following the lead
of national newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The New
York Times which have recently either boosted or plan to raise
prices.
   The Journal boosted its price per copy to 75 cents from 50 cents
on Dec. 3 while The Times plans to boost the price of its national
edition to 75 cents from 50 cents in the Midwes and from 60 cents
in the Southwest in January.
   ``Everybody is going to be more aggressive in circulation
pricing next year,'' said Peter Appert, media analyst at C.J.
Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell.
   But boosting the cover price may be particularly risky for The
National, which is counting heavily on circulation revenue.
   Only two weeks ago, the newspaper told advertisers that it was
reducing its circulation guarantee by 27 percent to 200,000 copies.
   The admission that it was not making its guaranteed average of
275,000 followed a review that resulted in the elimination of its
Sunday edition, the dismissal of the circulation manager and two
other top executives and layoffs of 18 other employees.
   The paper is now publishing five times a week, Monday through
Friday.
   Whether the cover price increase drives away readers remains
unclear.
   The National's Hammond said the newspaper feels it has ``a loyal
and dedicated audience'' that will pay the higher price.
   The media analyst Appert said, ``For the the dedicated sports
fanatic 75 cents versus 50 cents won't be a problem, just like it
isn't a problem for The Wall Street Journal and dedicated financial
readers.''
   ``But will they lose some marginal circulation? Absolutely,'' he
said.
   The National premiered Jan. 31 with editions in New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles. It has since added editions in San Diego,
San Francisco, Dallas, Detroit, Boston, Miami-Fort Lauderdale and
Baltimore-Washington, D.C.
   It is scheduled to expand next year with editions in
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Denver and Seattle, insiders said.
   The National is owned by National American Sports
Communications, a private partnership controlled by Mexican media
baron Emilio Azcarraga. He has declined to be interviewed about the
newspaper.
   It has been reported he was prepared to spend $100 million over
five years on the paper, and that first-year losses exceeded his
expectations.
   Media analysts say it remains unclear whether there are enough
readers for a sports daily. They say local newspapers and
established outlets such as Gannett Co. Inc.'s USA Today newspaper
are already providing a heavy dose of sports news.
   In addition, USA Today disclosed last week it is studying
whether to produce a weekly sports tabloid, which could mean even
more competition for sports readers.
   Asked to rate The National's chances for survival, Appert said,
``It's still a long shot.''

<HEAD>Say South African Ties Don't Hurt Business Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies that still do business in
South Africa find that economic sanctions haven't hurt their
business performance, new investment research findings show.
   Since 1980, companies with South African business ties saw their
return on investment improve by one percentage point per year over
companies without business dealings in that nation, researcher John
Freeman said in an interview Friday.
   Return on investment, a commonly used barometer to measure a
company's financial performance, is a percentage calculated by
dividing assets into net income.
   The joint research by Freeman, a manager for BARRA, an
investment consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif., and Martingdale
Asset Management in Boston, sought to ``neutralize all the other
things and isolate the South African factor,'' Freeman said.
   Their unpublished research was conducted for investment fund
managers to help them understand the risk of divestiture from South
Africa, he said.
   The study showed that between January 1980 and August 1984,
companies with South African ties lost 150 basis points in the
return on investment annually when compared with non-South African
companies. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The trend then reversed itself. From August 1984 to October
1990, companies with South African ties outperformed the others by
280 basis points per year.
   Freeman admitted the research results surprised him; activists
who oppose apartheid, South Africa's policy of racial separation,
were surprised as well.
   The research raises the question of whether the sanctions were
designed to make companies unattractive as investments, hurt their
business or merely force them out of South Africa.
   ``Our view is the goal was to get major companies to leave South
Africa,'' said Patrick McVeigh, vice president of Franklin Research
and Development Corp. in Boston. Franklin offers what it calls
socially responsible investment portfolios for companies without
South African connections.
   He said wounding a company's performance generally was ``a
secondary weapon'' of divestment, ``but it never was a primary
goal.''
   Since 1984, 170 U.S. companies have removed their employees or
direct investments in South Africa, said Meg Vorhees, South African
research director at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in
Washington, which keeps track of American corporate relations with
South Africa. She said 114 U.S. companies maintain direct
investments or employees in that nation.
   The pullout stems from international outrage over the political
suppression and human rights abuses of South Africa's blacks. As of
June 1990, 19 states and 55 cities have adopted policies calling
for full or partial divestiture of securities with South African
links, said Ms. Vorhees.
   The divestment question was posed to numerous government pension
funds, endowments and foundations throughout the 1980s. Scattered
protests flared on college campuses during the period as students
urged school pull South African-related investments.
   She criticized the Martingdale-BARRA findings, saying most
American companies derive a small amount of their business from
South African subsidiaries or investments.
   ``It's hard for me to believe it would make that much of a
difference. In general, U.S. companies with operations in South
Africa account for less than 1 percent of their assets,'' she said.
   Franklin says its South Africa-clean investment portfolio has
performed slightly better than the Standard and Poor's 500 index
during a 15-year period. ``The difference is very small,'' said
McVeigh. ``If anything, over time, it's become less of an issue
because of the companies that have pulled out of South Africa.''

<HEAD>K-III Holdings Agrees to Buy Field Corp. Publishing Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partnership K-III Holdings said Friday it
has agreed to acquire the ``Weekly Reader,'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls
encyclopedias and other publishing operations from the
privately-held Field Corp.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but one source familiar
with the transaction said the price was about $200 million.
   K-III Holdings is a New York-based investment partnership headed
by several former executives of the publishing giant Macmillan Inc.
and backed by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   The partnership already has interests in educational publishing,
trade magazines and directories for the transportation industry.
   The deal would more than double the size of its operations, as
the assets being acquired generated revenue estimated at nearly
$300 million this year compared with K-III's operations with about
$230 million in revenue.
   Field Corp., based in Chicago, is owned by Marshall Field V and
the Field family trusts. It put its publishing operations up for
sale last summer, reportedly because it was dissatisfied with its
return on the operations.
   The source who spoke on condition that he not be identified said
there were believed to be a number of companies interested in parts
of the operation being sold but far fewer were interested in all of
them.
   He said Field has been talking exclusively with K-III Holdings
for the past six weeks.
   K-III has agreed to buy the assets of Field Publications LP,
which include the ``Weekly Reader,'' a current events publication
that reaches more than 8.5 million elementary school children and
700,000 teachers with information designed for use in the
classroom.
   Field Publications, based in Middletown, Conn., is the largest
U.S. marketer of children's book clubs and other programs supplied
regularly through the mail.
   K-III's Newbridge Communications business already markets
educational materials through book clubs and other direct marketing
programs to more than 400,000 teachers.
   Funk &amp; Wagnalls, based in Ramsey, N.J., publishes encyclopedias
for children and markets them primarily through supermarkets.
   ``These busineses offer a strategic fit with the educational
focus'' of Newbridge, said William F. O'Reilly, chairman and chief
executive of K-III Holdings. ``This is one of those rare
opportunities where there is a real compatibility with existing
operations.''
   K-III Holdings President Charles McCurdy said no sunstantial
changes are planned at either company in terms of product or
management.
   The deal is expected to be completed in early 1991.

   Oil prices fell below $26 a barrel Friday
despite a refusal by Saddam Hussein to withdraw Iraqi forces from
Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Traders instead withdrew from oil futures positions to avoid
losses if the gulf situation changes over the market's four-day
Christmas weekend.
   Light sweet crude oil for February delivery fell 47 cents to
$25.92 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the
third straight daily decline. Crude oil prices dropped 63 cents in
the week.
   In an interview with Germany's ZDF television network, Saddam,
Iraq's president, was asked if he would pull troops out of Kuwait
by a Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations. ``No,'' he
answered.
   ``We are certain that even when (President) Bush pushes his
country into war, which he plans, he can't keep it going,'' Saddam
said. He did not elaborate.
   Ed Kevelson, an oil trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
the market rallied to a high of $26.75 a barrel shortly after the
comments were broadcast, but tumbled late in the day. The outbreak
of war likely would curtail oil supplies, raising prices.
   He said oil traders were reluctant to enter into deals that
could lose them money should unexpected developments occur in the
Persian Gulf over the long weekend. The Mercantile Exchange, a
leading market for oil traders, is closed Christmas Eve.
   In the crude oil market, contracts for later delivery months
also fell, though by smaller amounts.
   Home heating oil contracts showed strength as traders responded
to a cold front in parts of the country.
   Heating oil rose .06 cent to 78.94 cents a gallon on contracts
for delivery in January after rising 1.04 cents on Thursday.
Heating oil for delivery in most later months was mixed.
   ``I think people were waiting to buy in to that market for the
first cold snap and here it is,'' Kevelson said.
   Unleaded gasoline dropped for all delivery months, with January
contracts down .44 cent to 66.24 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas prices, which have declined because of warm fall
weather, rose for a second straight day. Natural gas for February
delivery was up 4.2 cents at $1.962 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   The dollar finished higher Friday on world
currency markets in erratic pre-holiday trading.
   Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity
Exchange gold bullion for current deliver fell $3.40 to settle at
$382.50 per troy ounce. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid
for gold of $381.25 an ounce, down $2.10.
   The dollar settled broadly higher in Europe and also gained
ground when trading shifted to domestic markets.
   Traders said the dollar continued to draw support from the
uncertainties created by the surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Thursday and from the volatile
Persian Gulf situation.
   The dollar advanced at the expense of the German mark, which was
particularly hard hit because of Germany's ties to the Soviet
Union. In addition to being a major lender to the Soviets, Germany
had been expected to benefit substantially by exporting goods
eastward once markets were opened.
   ``The market is extremely nervous to hold marks, so (traders)
are selling marks and buying dollars,'' said Andrew Busch, a trader
with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Trading was particularly thin, accentuating movements in the
dollar. ``We're trading in fits and starts,'' said Curtis Perkins,
a dealer at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, adding that
many investors were squaring up their books ahead of the Christmas
holiday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 135.70 Japanese yen from
134.58 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it rose further to
135.78 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 135.50 yen, down from
135.85 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound weakened to $1.8835 from $1.9080
late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8860 to buy one pound,
cheaper than Thursday's $1.8930.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late

   The most comprehensive Western study of the
Soviet economy ever made concluded Friday that Mikhail Gorbachev's
only hope to save it is a radical, ``irreversible break with the
past.''
   The study called for the besieged Soviet citizens to swallow the
bitter economic medicine of ending price controls on basic
commodities while accepting the imposition of wage controls.
   While conceding that unemployment would rise and output would
fall, experts at the International Monetary Fund insisted that
Gorbachev's more gradual reforms had not worked and must be junked.
   The report supported President Bush's arguments that large
amounts of direct aid should not be given to the Soviet Union
without more fundamental reorganization of its economy.
   In the short term, the report said Western countries should
emphasize technical assistance in such areas as banking, law and
transportation. Help with environmental problems and modernization
of energy production system would be useful, it said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday that the
report was being distributed to the leaders of the nations which
had requested it last July at the seven-nation economic summit in
Houston. It was ordered in an attempt to bridge a gap between
French and German leaders pushing for endorsement of an immediate
$15 billion aid package and a reluctant Bush and others.
   ``The general recommendations of the report are recommendations
that the United States will support and subscribe to,'' Baker said
in comments which indicated the document is likely to form the
blueprint for Western assistance to the Soviets in the next year.
   Preparing the report were experts from the 154-nation IMF and
its sister organization, the World Bank, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
   President Bush and other members of his administration were
briefed Thursday by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and
World Bank President Barber Conable.
   ``The specific measures that have been adopted do not yet
constitute the coherent and comprehensive program which, in our
view, is necessary if the transition (to a free-market economy) is
to be successful,'' the study said.
   The old government-controlled economy has collapsed and been
replaced by depleted store shelves, rampant growth of the black
market and bartering for goods.
   Gorbachev must move quickly to establish private property rights
and reform such vital sectors as farming, the crumbling
distribution network, energy production and manufacturing, the
study said.
   Immediate help could be useful in modernizing oil drilling
techniques and nuclear power plants and upgrading the natural gas
pipeline system, it said.
   ``These changes cannot be made in a matter of weeks,'' the
report said. ``But the imperative is to make sufficient progress at
the beginning so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with
the past and the process gains an unstoppable momentum.''
   In many ways, the report called for the cold-turkey economic
reforms that Poland has undertaken over the past year. Those
reforms have put goods in the stores, slowed inflation and
stabilized the international value of the currency, but at the cost
of much pain and disenchantment.
   It is an open question whether Gorbachev could do the same in
the sprawling, more diverse Soviet Union, given the widespread
dissatisfaction in the various republics with his leadership.
   But the International Monetary Fund said the Soviet central
government could not return to a directed economy even if it wanted
to, and has no essential choice but to accelerate the transition to
a market economy.
   ``Ideally, a path of gradual reform could be laid out which
would minimize economic disturbance,'' the report said. ``But we
know of no such path, the more particularly given the difficult
starting conditions.''
   In addition to the United States, Friday's report was requested
by Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   A separate study done for the European Economic Community came
to the same conclusion Friday that massive amounts of direct
Western aid now would be wasted.

<HEAD>Silver Gives Up Recent Gains, Settles Near $4</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange on profit-taking that erased most of the gains
made earlier this week. Gold and platinum futures also retreated.
   On other commodity markets, soybean futures plunged; grains were
mixed; orange juice futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed;
and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Silver futures ended 17.4 cents to 19 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December down 17.4 cents at $4.025 a troy
ounce.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.70 lower on the Commodity Exchange with
December at $382.50 a troy ounce; platinum was $11.50 to $11.70
lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange with January at $407.20 a
troy ounce.
   Silver led the precious metals lower as traders who bought
contracts earlier in the week took profits in a market made thin
and volatile by the absence of players getting an early start on
the long Christmas weekend, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Spot silver prices had soared nearly 24 cents in the two
previous trading sessions after the Federal Reserve Board moved to
lower interest rates. Silver has many industrial applications and
its price surged amid hopes that lower rates would stimulate the
economy.
   But ``it moved up too fast, it was overbought,'' Raptopoulos
said. When a few traders started selling into Friday's thin market,
others followed suit and prices plunged, she said.
   All New York commodities markets will be closed Saturday through
Tuesday. The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
will hold abbreviated trading sessions Monday.
   Soybean futures plunged on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting frustration over the slack pace of export sales and
fears that a political shakeup is brewing in the Soviet Union that
could bring a halt to U.S. sales of soybean meal to the Soviets.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 1{ cents higher with March at
$2.61{ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to \ cent higher with March
at $2.34 a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent lower with March
at $1.11\ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8{ cents lower with
January at $5.62} a bushel.
   Orange juice futures for January delivery fell sharply amid
profit-taking on the New York Cotton Exchange after several days of
strong gains tied to the slim possibility of freezing temperatures
in the Florida citrus belt during the Christmas weekend.
   Other orange juice contracts, which are limited to daily moves
of 5 cents a pound, rose moderately to catch up with January, which
has no price limits and jumped a total of 16 cents in the three
previous sessions.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.6 cents lower to 1.85
cents higher with January at $1.164 a pound.
   Most petroleum futures prices retreated in the face of few
significant developments in the Persian Gulf. Near-term heating oil
contracts rallied, though, on forecasts for bitterly cold weather
early next week in the Northeast, the biggest heating-oil market.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 17 cents to 47 cents lower with
February at $25.92 a barrel; heating oil was .62 cent lower to .27
cent higher with January at 78.94 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .30 cent to .45 cent lower with January at 66.24 cents a
gallon; natural gas futures settled unchanged to 5.7 cents higher
with February at $1.962 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed ahead of a monthly
Agriculture Department cold-storage report that showed 24.1 million
pounds of pork bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as of
Nov. 30.
   The number was near the high end of traders' expectations but
far below the 67.5 million pounds in cold storage a year earlier.
   Live cattle futures settled .02 cent to .15 cent lower with
February at 76.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower
to .17 cent higher with January at 88.62 cents a pound; live hogs
were .18 cent lower to .95 cent higher with February at 49.07 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .55 cent higher
with February at 64.62 cents a pound.

   The Soviet Union owes $55.2 billion abroad,
putting it among the world's top debtors, according to a study
Friday from the International Monetary Fund.
   It said that was the total last June, based on calculations of
its own staff.
   The figure was higher than some previous estimates. The CIA put
net Soviet debt last year at $33.3 billion. According to the World
Bank, the fund's sister organization, Indonesia's debt - the fifth
largest in the Third World - was $53.1 billion last year. Egypt was
sixth with $48.8 billion.
   The top Third World debtor, Brazil, owed $111.3 billion.
   The bank gave no figure for the Soviet Union, which does not
belong to either the bank or the fund.
   The Soviets would like to join and be able to borrow from them
as well as from governments and commercial banks. The United
States, the most influential member, has opposed membership for the
Soviets. President Bush has proposed a special status which would
give Moscow technical aid, but not loans.
   Many bankers and business people consider the amount that a
country has to pay out in the course of a year more important than
the total debt. The fund estimated that $13.4 billion in principal
and interest was due from the Soviets this year and $9.4 billion in
1989.
   By way of comparison Brazil, which owes twice as much as the
Soviets, had $9.3 billion due last year but has actually been
paying only part of it. This year Brazil has not been paying
interest at all. There has been no public indication that the
Soviets are behind on their debt payments, but the report said
trade credits of about $5 billion are overdue.
   A large amount of the principal of Soviet debt - about $12
billion worth, according to the report - will fall due next year.
   The fund estimated that in trade with the western world, the
Soviets will be buying $6.6 billion to $9.9 billion worth of goods
and services more than it sells in 1991. Such a deficit would
increase its debt further.
   ``We must stress that balance of payments assistance should
accompany the introduction of a major and comprehensive reform
program,'' the report added.
   ``Without such a reform, additional financial resources would be
of little or no lasting value.''

   Stock prices churned through a mixed session
Friday amid strong cross-currents created by a quarterly ``triple
witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 4.20 to
2,633.66, bringing its gain for the week to 39.85 points.
   Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 774 up, 793
down and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 233.40 million
shares, up from 174.70 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 271.77 million shares.
   Trading was heavy both early in the morning and late in the
session as professional investors engaged in maneuvers involving a
group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   Some of those contracts were settled on the basis of opening
stock prices Friday, and others as of the close.
   The witching hour, which falls on the third Friday of March,
June, September and December, was often a turbulent occasion for
the market in years past. But recently it has been taking place in
more orderly style.
   Beyond that specialized activity, analysts said it was an
uneventful session, with many investors getting an early start on
the Christmas holidays.
   The markets will be open Monday for an abbreviated Christmas eve
session ending at 2 p.m. EST, instead of the usual 4 p.m. close.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up { at
58; Exxon, up &rsqb; at 50}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up | at 31;
International Business Machines, up &lsqb; at 113~, and Ford Motor, up ~
at 26&rsqb;.
   Bank stocks, which have been making at a run at a rally lately
from severely depressed levels, were mostly lower in Friday's
activity.
   Manufacturers Hanover lost &lsqb; to 24; Citicorp \ to 13{;
BankAmerica { to 27{, and Chemical Banking { to 11&rsqb;. But J.P.
Morgan rose \ to 46\.
   Black &amp; Decker, which projected lower-than-expected quarterly
earnings, dropped &rsqb; to 10&lsqb;.
   Pan Am Corp. gained &lsqb; to 1{. The company expressed its readiness
to consider a bid from Carl Icahn, chairman of TWA, to acquire it
for $1.50 a share in cash, plus debt securities.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.89 billion, or
0.35 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.55 to 180.87.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.93 to 387.93, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.63 at 331.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.30 to 373.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 306.20, down .29.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Dallas thrift president Edwin T. McBirney
III agreed to plead guilty to fraud and help federal investigators
chase other thrift scandal figures, the Justice Department said
Friday.
   McBirney, who led Sunbelt Savings Association, is the second
major thrift official in two days to be convicted of wrongdoing
that cost taxpayers millions of dollars.
   A federal court jury on Thursday found former Vernon Savings
Association owner Don R. Dixon guilty of 23 counts of fraud and
misapplication of funds. A magistrate ordered Dixon held without
bond until his Feb. 19 sentencing.
   ``Federal prosecutors have dealt a one-two punch to the savings
and loan crooks this week,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
in Washington.
   Sunbelt's 1986 failure is estimated to have cost taxpayers $2
billion, and Vernon's in 1987 cost $1.3 billion.
   In return for his help, prosecutors agreed to limit McBirney's
penalty to $7.5 million in restitution and $8.5 million to settle
civil claims by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. McBirney also
may be sentenced to up to 15 years imprisonment.
   ``We are confident that Mr. McBirney's cooperation is going to
lead to the indictment of other major insiders in the next two
years,'' said Marvin Collins, U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of Texas.
   McBirney, 37, filed the plea in federal court Friday. A date had
not been scheduled for him to appear before a judge.
   The deal was made last month, but prosecutors arranged not to
file or publicize it until Dixon's trial was over, Collins said.
   They did not want to risk complicating the Dixon trial, which
began in October, he said. In September, the fraud conviction of
two Vernon borrowers was thrown out when the judge learned the jury
had discussed Dixon's indictment during its deliberations.
   ``We were being perhaps just a little extra cautious,'' Collins
said. ``With these very large cases, we are taking extra care.''
   McBirney, who was indicted in July on 17 counts, agreed to plead
guilty to four counts of bank fraud, filing a false corporate tax
return, causing a false statement to be filed by Sunbelt and
misapplying $250,000 in Sunbelt funds.
   The bank fraud count stems from a $700 million deal to finance
the purchase of real estate in Southern California by a Sunbelt
subsidiary.
   McBirney agreed to admit that he arranged a fraudulent $30
million reciprocal loan arrangement with Western Savings
Association, another former Dallas thrift, to help finance the real
estate deal.
   The former owner of Western Savings, Jarrett Woods, goes on
trial next month on 37 charges he misapplied funds and falsified
records that led to the thrift's $1 billion failure.
   Dixon, 52, was convicted of illegally spending money from his
Vernon Savings Association on prostitutes and a California beach
house. He could be sentenced to as many as 115 years in prison and
fined $5.75 million for his convictions on 23 fraud counts.

<TEXT>
   The FBI arrested three men Friday in an
alleged $2 million-a-month scheme to lease nonexistent copy
machines to businesses around the country.
   The FBI said in an affidavit that the defendants purported to
sell the copiers to companies that buy used Xerox Corp. machines
for leasing.
   The buyers believed the copiers would be leased for them by a
Pennsylvania company, the FBI said. The alleged scam relied on the
buyers never having to see the machines, since they supposedly were
being leased by a third party.
   ``This is a typical pyramid scheme where an investor group pays
in a large amount and is then paid back on a monthly basis,'' Milt
Ahlerich, the FBI's special agent in charge of Connecticut, said.
   ``They think they are getting a terrific return on their
investment, but the money is actually coming out of their original
investment,'' he said.
   Randy T. Hilgert, 32, of Madison; Thomas J. Becker, of North
Kingstown, R.I.; and John F. Rodgers, of Arcola, Pa., each was
charged with wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering, Ahlerich
said.
   Hilgert was released Friday on $25,000 bond. The status of the
other two men was not known. Federal agents seized property
belonging to the three and records from the businesses involved.
   The alleged victim companies were paid a monthly fee for leasing
the nonexistent machines. Sales of the machines averaged about $2
million a month, but in September, for example, lease payments
totaled only $570,000.
   A large percentage of the victims were banks located around the
country. Ahlerich said several companies allegedly were victimized,
but declined to specify.
   Hilgert was the broker for the machines, the FBI said. He
allegedly deposited about $500,000 a week into an account at the
New England Savings Bank in Madison. The bank, which said it knew
Hilgert for years as a local carpenter and landscaper, notified the
FBI about the deposits.
   On the same day he made the deposits, the FBI said, Hilgert
would wire 90 percent of the money to Becker Associates of
Bridgeport, Pa.
   In one example, Hilgert sold 14 used copiers to Banc One Leasing
Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, which believed the machines would be
leased by Becker Associates, which was operating under the name
Rhino Copy, the affidavit said.
   Rhino Copy was supposed to be leasing the machines for Banc One
and then making monthly payments to the bank, the FBI said. Since
it was receiving monthly payments on time, Banc One decided to buy
10 more machines.
   FBI Special Agent Marilyn Lucht went to Pennsylvania for Banc
One to inspect the machines the company thought it owned, the
affidavit said. She found about 90 copiers at Rhino Copy, but only
six were operational.
   Lucht said Becker and Rodgers told her all of their machines
were leased, had been purchased by Hilgert and were refurbished by
Centralized Services Inc.
   Centralized Services was a vendor and refurbisher of the used
copiers sold by Hilgert to the victim leasing companies, FBI said.
Lucht said in an affidavit that the company ``only exists on
paper.''
   Centralized Services' president is a former Xerox repairman,
Ralph Sylvestri, the FBI said. He has not been charged and the FBI
declined to comment on his role in the investigation.

   General Motors Corp. will open permanent offices
in Moscow and the Russian auto manufacturing city of Togliatti, the
Tass news agency reported Friday.
   The U.S. automaker received an accreditation permit to open the
offices. The document was presented to Ralph Andersen, GM's program
director for the Soviet Union, on behalf of the Soviet Foreign
Economic Relations Ministry, Tass said.
   GM in June announced a five-year, $1 billion deal with Volga
Auto Works, known by its acronym VAZ, to supply 100,000 to 150,000
engine control systems per year beginning in 1992.
   Valentin Morozov, first deputy minister for automobile and farm
machine building, said GM's presence in the Soviet Union was the
result of two years of negotiations, Tass reported.
   He praised the deal with GM as an important contract that may
pave the way for more such agreements.
   VAZ builds Zhiguli and Lada compact cars and the Niva, a Soviet
sport-utility vehicle.

   A higher-than-expected federal deficit, tensions
in the Middle East, and the holiday season combined to depress bond
prices Friday in moderate trading.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down | point, or
$6.25 per $1,000 in face amount, at Friday's closing. Its yield,
which rises when prices fall, was up to 8.29 percent from 8.23
percent late Thursday.
   ``We had more rhetoric coming from Mideast situation, the
holiday atmosphere, and a larger-than-expected budget deficit. Put
it all together and I think it explains what happened today,'' said
Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   The federal government reported a $48.1 billion deficit in
November, a 62 percent increase over a year earlier. The government
blamed the red ink on the Persian Gulf buildup and a failing
economy.
   Traders generally see large deficits as pushing up interest
rates because the Treasury must offer attractive yields when it
peddles large amounts of debt to finance government operations.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein predicted in an interview
broadcast Friday that if war broke out in the gulf, President Bush
would be forced to retreat after American casualties reached 5,000.
   Saddam also refused to pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15
deadline set by the United Nations for avoiding force. Traders
predict a Gulf war will hike the price of oil and increase
inflation, which erodes the price of bonds.
   In addition, the market faced what traders called year-end
pressures because banks are scrambling to obtain cash - and in turn
bidding up the cost of funds - to fulfill financial obligations
before the New Year.
   Broker Marilyn Cohen viewed the price drop as ``a normal
pullback in a bull market for bonds. People were so over-bought in
the bond market,'' she said.
   Ms. Cohen, investment broker for Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly
Hills, Calif., said she wasn't distressed over the decline in bond
prices because ``clearly interest rates are not going up for the
time being.''
   ``This is the relief the bond market needs in order to gather
full steam and move ahead again,'' she said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities were down 1-16 point to 7-32 point, intermediate
maturities fell \ point to 13-32 point and long-term issues lost {
point to | point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service
reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, was down 2.91 to 1,181.99.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills held at 6.73 percent as the
discount rate rose 1 basis point to 6.54 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 6.91 percent as the discount rose 6basis
point to 6.60 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 6.93
percent as the discount was up 4 basis points to 6.51 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7\ percent, up from 7&lsqb; percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds dropped 1-32 point to 91 9-32. The average
yield to maturity held at 7.47 from late Thursday.

   Bank of New England Corp. would receive an
injection of $605 million in capital if the ailing company agrees
to a debt-for-equity swap proposed Friday.
   Committees representing holders of $705 million worth of Bank of
New England bonds have agreed to exchange their bonds for stock
that will give them 92 percent ownership of the company, said
Wilbur Ross, who represents some of the bond holders.
   Meanwhile in Washington, the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced the troubled bank has settled - without admitting or
denying wrongdoing - allegations that it didn't disclose financial
problems in its quarterly financial statements.
   Settlement negotiations were reported earlier, but neither the
SEC nor the bank would provide details until Friday's announcement
in Washington.
   Under the debt-for-equity swap, the debt would be reduced from
$705 million to $100 million. The difference, or $605 million,
would be converted to equity capital for the bank.
   ``That's a huge amount,'' Ross said. ``The bank severely needs
capital.''
   But an analyst said this deal alone could not solve the bank's
problems.
   Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., called
the deal ``a major step forward, but I would not say this event in
and by itself is a panacea for their problems.''
   He said the bank must reduce its troubled loan portfolio and
hope that the economy will halt its slide and begin to rebound.
   James Dorsey, a bank spokesman, said the bank would review the
bondholders' offer and discuss it with the board of directors.
   Ross, reading from a statement, said the deal would provide the
bank with ``additional flexibility and financial wherewithal to
continue to address its current financial problems.''
   At the same time, the finances would be ``saving the federal
government enormous taxpayer sums which would otherwise be spent if
the (bank or its subsidiaries) were to be closed.''
   Bank of New England has struggled for more than a year from bad
real estate loans. Analysts say the bank was hurt by a declining
real estate market that exposed shoddy lending practices.
   A congressional report released this week concluded that the
bank became insolvent by some measures in June, although the bank
disputed the calculations.
   At the end of its most recent quarter on Sept. 30, the bank had
a capital to assets ratio of 1.1 percent, below the 3 percent
target set by federal regulators in orders signed by the government
and the bank earlier this year.
   The bank declined to say whether the capital infusion would push
the ratio above that goal.
   Cassidy said it is uncertain whether the added capital would
allow the bank to reach the 3 percent target, noting that the bank
is expected to report a fourth-quarter loss.
   Under any proposed debt-for-equity swap, the bank's common
shareholders will likely be wiped out, the bank has said.
   Bank of New England shares were selling for $1, down 25 cents a
share, in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In the SEC action, the federal stock market watchdog filed a
civil lawsuit against the bank at federal court in Washington
charging the Bank of New England knowingly understated losses in
its loan portfolio in a quarterly financial report in September
1989.
   Without admitting or denying the allegations, the bank agreed to
restate its third quarter financial statements for 1989, to have
independent accountants review its internal auditing procedures and
to otherwise reform its quarterly financial reporting practices.
   ``We're pleased we were able to arrive at a satisfactory
settlement with the SEC and that we can put this matter behind
us,'' said Dorsey, the bank spokesman. ``The SEC settlement has no
affect on the company's current business operations and will in no
way interfere with our ongoing affairs.''
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said the agency did not seek
monetary penalties from the bank because the allegations pre-dated
a 1990 law giving the SEC powers to impose fines.
   Breeden said the bank's second quarter financial statement in
1989 didn't adequately address trends affecting the bank, including
the deteriorating New England real estate market. ``In the third
quarter, it failed to contain adequate provisions for losses,''
said Breeden, adding that the bank didn't take a $1 billion
writeoff of its loan losses until after it made a $250 million
public securities offering.

<HEAD>Airbus May Launch Big Jet To Compete With Boeing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airbus Industrie said Friday it is considering
developing a commercial jet larger than Boeing's 747.
   The Airbus plane, tentatively dubbed the A350, would be able to
carry up to 700 passengers with a range of at least 7,000 miles.
The four-engine jet, which could cost $4 billion to develop, could
enter service by 2002, Airbus said.
   Boeing's 747, the world's largest passenger plane, was first put
into service 20 years ago. Since launching the 747 program in 1966,
Boeing has announced orders for 1,123 for all models of the jumbo
jet.
   Its latest version of the 747, the model 400, technically can
hold up to 600 passengers, but achieves an 8,400-mile range with
412 passengers in three classes.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. also produces a long-range,
high-capacity jet, the MD-11, which can carry up to 405 passengers
5,700 miles.
   Airbus' largest current model, the A340-300, can carry 295
passengers in three classes up to 7,600 miles. Its first flight is
scheduled for next year.
   Boeing executives have discussed the possibility of building a
larger 747 sometime around the turn of the century, but the company
is not actively developing such a jet, Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group spokesman Tom Cole said.

<HEAD>Taj Mahal Bondholders Could Select Three of Seven Directors</HEAD>

   Bondholders in Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino
will have a say in who sits on the board of the Atlantic City
gaming house under a proposed bankruptcy reorganization plan,
documents disclosed Friday.
   A compromise arrangement reached last month between Trump and
investors after Trump missed a $47.3 million interest payment
called for restructuring the debt in what is known as a
``prepackaged'' bankruptcy filing.
   The prepackaged plan, which negotiators said would enable the
casino to emerge from court protection within weeks, was unveiled
Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   It calls for noteholders to swap bonds paying 14 percent
interest for a package of lower paying bonds plus stock in the Taj
Mahal.
   The stock would entitle bondholders to elect three of the seven
members of the board of directors. Trump would get to pick the
other four.
   The deal calls for holders of bonds due in 1998, which pay 14
percent interest, to exchange them for bonds due in 1999 that will
pay 11.25 percent interest.
   In addition, for each $1,000 in old bonds investors would get
one share of Class B stock, which has voting rights, and one share
of Class A common stock.
   The Taj Mahal has been unable to break even since its April 2
opening in Atlantic City.
   The deal was reached about 12 hours after Trump missed a $47.3
million interest payment on $675 million worth of high-yield junk
bonds used to finance the Taj Mahal. The bondholders had threatened
to push Trump into bankruptcy proceedings and seize control of the
casino.
   Under a compromise arrangement, bondholders initially will
receive 50 percent of the stock in the casino. But if Trump is able
to pay the original 14 percent interest on the bonds, his stake in
the Taj Mahal will increase to 80 percent.
   In a prepackaged bankruptcy, a debtor and creditors agree on a
plan to reorganize a company before entering court proceedings.
Such arrangments require approval of two-thirds of creditors
holding 50 percent of a company's debt. They typically reduce the
time a company needs to reorganize its debt.

   Pan Am and TWA, two of the oldest and weakest
airlines, said they were close to a combination that would end
their rivalry and mark a dramatic consolidation in the troubled
industry.
   Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn had proposed a
buyout of Pan Am Corp. last weekend in a deal worth about $375
million. Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett responded with a letter
Friday saying such an arrangement could be ``advantageous to our
shareholders, employees and other constituencies.''
   But Plaskett said Pan Am would need an infusion of cash before
the purchase could be completed.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal government ran up a $48.1 billion
deficit in November, a 62 percent increase over a year ago, due in
part to the Persian Gulf buildup and a failing economy, the
Treasury Department reported.
   Combined with the October deficit, the imbalance for the first
two months of fiscal 1991 totaled $79.5 billion, up 42.5 percent
from the comparable period of fiscal 1990, the government said
Friday.

   The CIA put net Soviet debt last year at $33.3 billion.
According to the World Bank, the fund's sister organization,
Indonesia's debt - the fifth largest in the Third World - was $53.1
billion last year.
